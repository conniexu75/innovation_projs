Here we provide proof from experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that the newly discovered SARS-associated coronavirus (SCV) is the aetiological agent of this disease. Our understanding of the aetiology of SARS will expedite the development of diagnostic tests, antiviral therapies and vaccines, and may allow a more concise case definition for this emerging disease."

https://openalex.org/W2079643856,"Numerous studies of the underlying causes of ageing have been attempted by examining diseases associated with premature ageing, such as Werner's syndrome and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). HGPS is a rare genetic disorder resulting in phenotypes suggestive of accelerated ageing, including shortened stature, craniofacial disproportion, very thin skin, alopecia and osteoporosis, with death in the early teens predominantly due to atherosclerosis. However, recent reports suggest that developmental abnormalities may also be important in HGPS. Here we describe the derivation of mice carrying an autosomal recessive mutation in the lamin A gene (Lmna) encoding A-type lamins, major components of the nuclear lamina. Homozygous mice display defects consistent with HGPS, including a marked reduction in growth rate and death by 4 weeks of age. Pathologies in bone, muscle and skin are also consistent with progeria. The Lmna mutation resulted in nuclear morphology defects and decreased lifespan of homozygous fibroblasts, suggesting premature cell death. Here we present a mouse model for progeria that may elucidate mechanisms of ageing and development in certain tissue types, especially those developing from the mesenchymal cell lineage."

Whereas p53 induces transcription through direct interaction with promoter DNA, the mechanism of p53-mediated transcriptional repression is less well understood. Early reports described the alleviation of p53-mediated repression by inhibitors of apoptosis, suggesting that negative regulation of transcription might occur only in conjunction with programmed cell death. More recently, it has been proposed that certain genes, such as survivin, are repressed by direct association of p53 with their promoters, followed by recruitment of a repressor complex. We show here that p53-mediated negative regulation of transcription could occur independently of apoptosis. In contrast, the amino-terminal transactivation domain of p53 was required for negative regulation of transcription. Similarly, the p53 homologue p73 diminished the expression of survivin and stathmin, depending on its transactivation domain. Mutation of the putative p53 binding site within the survivin promoter did not impair its repression. These observations raised the hypothesis that activation of an effector gene might be required for repression by p53. Strikingly, when the p53-inducible p21/CDKN1A gene was deleted, p53 no longer repressed any one among 11 genes that it down-regulates otherwise. Most of these genes were also repressed by ectopic p21 in the absence of p53. Overexpressed c-Myc reduced the transcription of p21/CDKN1A and impaired p53-mediated repression but did not abolish repression by ectopic p21. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that increased expression of p21/CDKN1A is necessary and sufficient for the negative regulation of gene expression by p53.

Its central role in tumor suppression becomes evident by the fact that the p53 gene is mutated in about 50% of human malignancies. p53 acts as a transcription factor, modulating the expression of growth and death regulators. As a result, cell proliferation is suppressed, and/or programmed cell death is induced (1Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that p53 activates a number of promoters through direct interaction with the promoter DNA and the subsequent recruitment of the basal transcription machinery, e.g. the TFIID complex and the p300/CPB histone acetyl transferases. A tetramer of p53 molecules is assembled through the carboxyl-terminal oligomerization domains. This allows the central domains to interact directly with a consensus DNA element. As a consequence, the amino-terminal transactivation domains interact with basal transcription factors, resulting in increased gene expression (2Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar, 3Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). However, it has long been noticed that some genes are negatively regulated (referred to as “repressed” hereafter) by p53, and the list of those genes has been extended for almost a decade (see Table I). When analyzing p53 mutants, and p53 in combination with inhibitors of apoptosis, a striking correlation of p53-mediated transcriptional repression and p53-induced apoptosis was observed, and this raised the hypothesis that negative regulation of gene expression by p53 might be crucial for the induction of apoptosis (4Sabbatini P.

Basically, three different scenarios can be envisioned. Negative regulation of gene expression by p53 might merely represent an epiphenomenon of apoptosis, i.e. p53 down-regulates certain genes not directly but only through the onset of cell death. This model is supported by the observed correlation between the ability of p53 mutants to repress transcription in reporter assays and their potential to induce apoptosis. Such a correlation exists in the case of p53 mutants lacking the proline-rich domain within residues 62–91 (8Roth J. Koch P. Contente A. Dobbelstein M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1834-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Venot C. Maratrat M. Dureuil C. Conseiller E. Bracco L. Debussche L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4668-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) or point mutants at residues 175 (10Ryan K.M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3692-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and 246 (8Roth J. Koch P. Contente A. Dobbelstein M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1834-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Further, early reports describe the down-regulation of reporter gene expression by p53, which was found to be reverted by inhibitors of apoptosis (4Sabbatini P. Chiou S.K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1060-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Shen Y. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, it should be noticed that in transient reporter assays, a large variety of promoters can be found repressed by p53 (5Shen Y. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and that this may not necessarily reflect the regulation of the corresponding cellular genes in all cases. Alternatively, p53 may lead to the negative regulation of gene expression by virtue of a repressor function and by direct interaction with promoter DNA. Such a scenario has been proposed for the repression of stathmin and survivin by p53 (11Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 12Hoffman W.H. Biade S. Zilfou J.T. Chen J. Murphy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3247-3257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). p53 was found to interact with the mSin3a protein that is part of transcriptional repressor complex (11Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Further, at least in the case of survivin, a p53 binding sequence was reported to exist within the promoter (12Hoffman W.H. Biade S. Zilfou J.T. Chen J. Murphy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3247-3257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). However, the question remains how p53 would simultaneously activate some genes and repress other genes after binding to the respective promoters. Further, if p53 activates and represses by different mechanisms, these functions could be expected to be separable by mutational analysis. However, no p53 mutant has been described that represses but no longer transactivates. Instead, a mutation at residues 22/23 abolishes both transactivation and repression (7Murphy M. Hinman A. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 13Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), although the interaction of p53 with mSin3a was mapped to amino acids 61–75 within p53 (14Zilfou J.T. Hoffman W.H. Sank M. George D.L. Murphy M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3974-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Unless a clear mode of distinction between activated and repressed promoters could be defined, the plausibility of a direct repression model remains to be questioned. A third model that will be proposed in this work ascribes p53-mediated repression to the induction of a repressor. Thus, p53 would first increase the levels of another transcriptional regulator, which in turn would negatively affect the expression of downstream genes. The first p53-induced gene to be identified was p21/Cip1/waf1/CDKN1A (15el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). As an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, p21 is known to prevent the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. family proteins and hence lead to the accumulation of hypophosphorylated pRb (16Bartek J. Lukas J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This protein species, in turn, binds to E2F family transcription factors and converts them from transcriptional activators to transcriptional repressors. Thus, it appears conceivable that p53 may negatively regulate the expression of genes through the induction of p21/CDKN1A and the consecutive hypophosphorylation of pRb and its relatives. Indeed, certain cell cycle regulators responsible for G2 arrest, such as CHK1 (17Gottifredi V. Karni-Schmidt O. Shieh S.S. Prives C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1066-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and cdc2 (18Taylor W.R. Schonthal A.H. Galante J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1998-2006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Flatt P.M. Tang L.J. Scatena C.D. Szak S.T. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4210-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), were found to be down-regulated at the mRNA and proteins levels by p53 and the p21/pRb/E2F pathway. However, the general dependence of p53-mediated negative gene regulation on the expression of p21/CDKN1A remains to be assessed. In this study we sought to discover the distinction between these three models. First, we provide evidence that, at least in the cases of survivin and stathmin, negative gene regulation by p53 is not a consequence of apoptosis. Second, p53 and the p53 homologue p73 were capable of down-regulating the expression of these genes, but each required a transactivation domain to do so. Analysis of the survivin promoter suggested that sequence elements other than the putative p53 binding motif are needed for repression by p53. Most strikingly, however, we show that the negative regulation of all p53-repressed genes analyzed entirely depends on the presence of p21/CDKN1A and that overexpressed p21 represses a similar set of genes. These results strongly argue that p53-mediated repression occurs mainly through the induction of the p21/CDKN1A gene.

Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1060-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), filled in with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and introduced into the EcoRV sites of the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV, followed by recombination with pAdEasy and transfection. An adenovirus vector to express p53mt22/23, with the mutation L22Q/W23S, was created by cloning the corresponding coding region from pRcCMVp53mt22/23 (13Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) into pAdtrack-CMV using HindIII and XbaI, followed by recombination and transfection. Viruses were amplified, the titer was determined, and infections were carried out as described (22Koch P. Gatfield J. Löber C. Hobom U. Lenz-Stöppler C. Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5941-5947PubMed Google Scholar, 28Weigel S. Dobbelstein M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 764-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Immunoblot—Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, followed by incubation with antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% milk powder and 0.05% Tween 20. Peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (whole immunoglobulin G; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) were then detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Antibody Pab1801 to p53, antibody Ab-1 to p21/cip1/waf1, and antibody Ab-2 against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were from Calbiochem. Another monoclonal mouse antibody against actin (clone C-2) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—H1299 cells were transduced with adenovirus vectors, and HCT116 cells were treated with doxorubicin. After 48 h, total RNA was prepared (Trizol reagent; Invitrogen), followed by reverse transcription with Superscript II polymerase (Invitrogen) and PCR amplification with Expand HiFi DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The PCR temperatures consisted of a 3-min denaturation step at 96 °C, followed by the indicated numbers of cycles at 96 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 70 °C for 50 s. These temperature cycles were used for all amplifications, except that in the case of ubiquitin, the 57 °C step was omitted. The primers and numbers of PCR cycles used were as follows. For each gene, the reverse transcription was started with the first (RT) oligonucleotide, whereas the PCR was carried out using the second (forward) and third (reverse) oligonucleotide.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The interaction of p53 with promoter elements was analyzed as described (8Roth J. Koch P. Contente A. Dobbelstein M.

We generated p53 and its mutants by in vitro transcription and translation using T7 RNA polymerase and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). These preparations (2.5 μl) were incubated with 1 μl of sheared salmon sperm DNA (0.1 μg/μl), 1 μl of poly(dA-dT) (1 μg/μl), 7 μl of EMSA buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5% bovine serum albumin, 12% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and, when indicated, 1 μl of monoclonal antibody 421 against p53 (100 μg/ml; Calbiochem) for 10 min at 23 °C. Subsequently, we added 1 ng of the radiolabeled DNA probe and continued the incubation for 1 h at 23 °C. The reaction mixes were then separated at 4 °C on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel with 0.5 Tris-buffered EDTA as running buffer, followed by autoradiography using a Bioimager (Fuji). We generated the probes by annealing the oligonucleotides indicated below to each other and performing fill-in reactions (exo-Klenow enzyme; MBI Fermentas) including [α-32P]dCTP. The oligonucleotides had the following sequences: survivin forward, GAC CGC CTA AGA GGG CGT GCG CTC CCG AC and survivin reverse, GGG CAT GTC GGG AGC GCA CGC CCT CTT AGG C; mutant survivin forward, GAC CGC CTA AGA GGG CGT GCG CTC CCG GG and mutant survivin reverse, GGG CAT CCC GGG AGC GCA CGC CCT CTT AGG C; p21 forward, GAT CGC GGC CGC GAA CAT GTC CCA ACA and p21 reverse, GGG CAA CAT GTT GGG ACA TGT TCG CGG CCG C; mutant p21 forward, GAT CGC GGC CGC GAA AAT TTC CCA AAA and mutant p21 reverse, GGG CAA AAT TTT GGG AAA TTT TCG CGG CCG C. p53-mediated Repression Is Not Inhibited by a Viral Antagonist of Pro-apoptotic Mitochondrial Factors—We tested whether p53-mediated transcriptional repression might be a result of p53-induced apoptosis. p53 was expressed in the p53 –/– cell line H1299 using an adenovirus expression vector. To block apoptosis, the adenovirus E1B-19-kDa protein was co-expressed with p53. E1B-19 kDa interferes with the proapoptotic functions of the mitochondrial bax and bak proteins (30Cuconati A. Degenhardt K. Sundararajan R. Anschel A. White E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4547-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and inhibits p53-mediated cell death (31Debbas M. White E.

Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar), was detected when p53 was expressed alone but not when p53 and E1B-19 kDa were co-expressed (Fig. 1A). In a parallel exper"
https://openalex.org/W2145261791,"In this study we have examined CD44 (a hyaluronan (HA) receptor) interaction with a RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (p115RhoGEF) in human metastatic breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231 cell line). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses indicate that both CD44 and p115RhoGEF are expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells and that these two proteins are physically associated as a complex in vivo. The binding of HA to MDA-MB-231 cells stimulates p115RhoGEF-mediated RhoA signaling and Rho kinase (ROK) activity, which, in turn, increases serine/threonine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein, Gab-1 (Grb2-associated binder-1). Phosphorylated Gab-1 promotes PI 3-kinase recruitment to CD44v3. Subsequently, PI 3-kinase is activated (in particular, α, β, γ forms but not the δ form of the p110 catalytic subunit), AKT signaling occurs, the cytokine (macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF)) is produced, and tumor cell-specific phenotypes (e.g. tumor cell growth, survival and invasion) are up-regulated. Our results also demonstrate that HA/CD44-mediated oncogenic events (e.g. AKT activation, M-CSF production and breast tumor cell-specific phenotypes) can be effectively blocked by a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Finally, we have found that overexpression of a dominant-negative form of ROK (by transfection of MBA-MD-231 cells with the Rho-binding domain cDNA of ROK) not only inhibits HA/CD44-mediated RhoA-ROK activation and Gab-1 phosphorylation but also down-regulates oncogenic signaling events (e.g. Gab-1·PI 3-kinase-CD44v3 association, PI 3-kinase-mediated AKT activation, and M-CSF production) and tumor cell behaviors (e.g. cell growth, survival, and invasion). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that CD44 interaction with p115RhoGEF and ROK plays a pivotal role in promoting Gab-1 phosphorylation leading to Gab-1·PI 3-kinase membrane localization, AKT signaling, and cytokine (M-CSF) production during HA-mediated breast cancer progression.

Because various CD44 isoforms mediate different functions, much attention has been paid to the changes in CD44v isoform production during malignant transformation (1Bourguignon L.Y.W. J.

In addition, CD44 has been shown to be involved in the production of cytokines (e.g. interleukin 8 (1Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Mammary Gland Biol.

These findings clearly indicate that CD44 plays a pivotal role in activating oncogenic signaling and HA-mediated breast tumor cell function. Members of the Rho subclass of the Ras superfamily (small molecular weight GTPases, e.g. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) are known to transduce signals regulating many cellular processes (25Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). The rationale for our focusing on RhoGTPase is based on previous reports suggesting that CD44-associated cytoskeletal proteins (e.g. ankyrin and ERM) and that tumor cell-specific phenotypes are dependent on RhoGTPase signaling events (16Bretscher A.

In particular, coordinated RhoGTPase signaling is considered to be a possible mechanism underlying cell proliferation and motility, an obvious prerequisite for metastasis (16Bretscher A. Curr. Opin.

To date, at least 30 different guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) have been identified (32Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Our recent results indicate that the interaction between CD44v3 isoform and two GEFs, such as Tiam1 (24Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Shao L. Chen Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1829-1838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and Vav2 (21Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Zhou B. Diedrich F. Singleton P.A. Hung M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48679-48692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), up-regulates Rac1 signaling and cytoskeleton-mediated metastatic tumor progression. As part of our continued effort to identify CD44 isoform-linked GEFs, which correlate with certain metastatic behaviors, a new candidate molecule, named p115RhoGEF, has been identified. p115RhoGEF, which is the human homolog of the mouse protein Lsc, is involved in RhoA activation (33Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar); structurally, it contains numerous functional domains and structural motifs found in signal transduction proteins and oncoproteins. These motifs include N-terminal RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) domain, a dbl homology domain (DH), and a pleckstrin homology domain (PH) (33Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 34Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In particular, the sequence between amino acids (aa) 421 and aa 635 contains significant sequence homology to the dbl homology domain (DH) of many proteins that exhibit GDP/GTP exchange activity for specific members of the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins (32Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The p115RhoGEF has been clearly shown to act as a GDP/GTP exchange protein for the Rho subfamily of GTPases, including RhoA (33Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). In addition, p115RhoGEF (similar to PDZ-RhoGEF) contains an RGS domain, which interacts with Gα13 and regulates the ability of DH to carry out GDP/GTP exchange activity for RhoA (33Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 34Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In the C-terminal region, p115RhoGEF contains one PH domain that is commonly detected in signaling molecules and cytoskeletal proteins (35Shaw G. Bioassays. 1996; 18: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 36Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Activation of RhoGTPases such as RhoA has been shown to produce specific structural changes in the plasma membrane associated with actin filament bundling, stress fiber formation, and acto-myosin-based cytoskeletal function (25Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). Several different enzymes have been identified as possible downstream targets for RhoA signaling. One such enzyme is Rho kinase (ROK, also called Rho-associated kinase), which is a serine-threonine kinase known to interact with Rho in a GTP-dependent manner (37Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 38Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). ROK is composed of four functional domains, including a kinase domain (catalytic site), a coiled-coil domain, a Rho-binding (RB) domain, and a PH domain (40Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). This enzyme has been shown to regulate cytoskeleton function by phosphorylating several important cytoskeletal regulators, including myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (41Kimura N. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu K. Kaibuchi K.

Commun. 2000; 273: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), adducin (43Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Kinoshita N. Kawano Y. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and Lin 11/Isl-1/Mec-3 (LIM) kinase (44Amano T. Tanabe K. Eto T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). ROK is also involved in the “cross-talk” between Ras and Rho signaling leading to cellular transformation (30Sahai E. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that ROK phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of the CD44v3, 8–10 isoform and up-regulates the interaction between the CD44v3, 8–10 isoform and the cytoskeletal protein, ankyrin, during HA/CD44-regulated tumor cell migration (22Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Shao L. Zhu D. Chen Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1999; 43: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Most recently, the PH domain of ROK is found to be involved in the direct binding to CD44- and HA-mediated Ca2+ signaling in endothelial cell function (45Singleton P.A. Bourguignon L.Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 2002; 53: 293-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, ROK is clearly one of the important signaling molecules required for membrane-cytoskeleton interaction, Ca2+ regulation, and HA/CD44-mediated cell function (22Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Shao L. Zhu D. Chen Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1999; 43: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 45Singleton P.A. Bourguignon L.Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 2002; 53: 293-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the pathogenesis of cancer, Grb-2-associated binder-1 (Gab-1) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) are key mediators in regulating oncogenesis (for review see Ref. 46Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Specifically, Gab-1 (a member of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family) functions as one of the major adapter molecules downstream of growth factor signaling (47Hogado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 8: 560-564Crossref Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 48Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Gab-1 also possesses multiple phosphorylation sites that could act as docking sites for PI 3-kinase known to consist of a catalytic subunit p110 (α, β, and δ) and regulatory subunit p85 (α, β, and p55γ) or the catalytic subunit p110γ and the regulatory subunit p101 (for reviews see Refs. 46Katso R.

One recent study found a positive link between HA-CD44 interaction and Gab-1-associated PI 3-kinase activation during the stimulation of cellular transformation by a Met-hepatocyte growth factor oncoprotein (Tpr-Met) (52Kamikura D.M. Khoury H. Maroun C. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3482-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HA and CD44 also promote PI 3-kinase signaling in a tumor cell-specific manner. For example, PI 3-kinase participates in CD44-mediated survival pathway in colon carcinoma cells (53Bates R.C. Edwards N.S. Burn G.F. Fisher D.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5275-5283PubMed Google Scholar). HA activates PI 3 kinase-AKT pathways leading to cell motility and cell survival-signaling pathways (54Sohara Y. Ishiguro N. Machida K. Kurata H. Thant A.A. Senga T. Matsuda S. Kimata K. Iwata H. Hamaguchi M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The active mutant of p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase exerts its action on the cleavage of CD44 during cancer cell migration (55Kawano Y. Okamoto I. Murakami D. Itoh H. Yoshida M. Ueda S. Saya H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29628-29635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These findings suggest PI 3-kinase activation is closely coupled with HA-mediated CD44 signaling. Because both Rho signaling and PI 3-kinase activation play an important role in regulating breast tumor progression, we have focused in this study on the relationship between these two signaling pathways during HA/CD44-mediated breast tumor progression. A unique mechanism is described concerning CD44 interaction with p115RhoGEF and ROK that stimulates Gab-1 phosphorylation/membrane localization and PI 3-kinase-AKT activation leading to HA/CD44-regulated cytokine production and tumor cell behaviors required for breast cancer progression. Cell Culture—The breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-231 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with Earle's salt solution, essential and non-essential amino acids, vitamins, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Antibodies and Reagents—Monoclonal rat anti-human CD44 antibody (clone: 020; isotype: IgG2b; obtained from CMB-Tech, Inc., San Francisco, CA) used in this study recognizes a common determinant of the CD44 class of glycoproteins. Both rabbit anti-CD44v3 antibody and rabbit anti-Rho kinase (ROK) were prepared according to the procedures described previously (22Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Shao L. Zhu D. Chen Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1999; 43: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For the preparation of polyclonal rabbit anti-p115RhoGEF antibody, specific synthetic peptides (∼15–17 amino acids unique for the ROK or p115RhoGEF sequence) were prepared by the Peptide Laboratories using an Advanced Chemtech automatic synthesizer (model ACT350). All polyclonal antibodies were prepared using conventional DEAE-cellulose chromatography and tested to be monospecific (by immunoblot assays). Mouse monoclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) were purchased from BD Pharmingen and Sigma, respectively. Rabbit anti-phospho-threonine antibody and rabbit anti-phospho-serine antibody were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Monoclonal mouse anti-p110α, mouse anti-p110β, mouse anti-p110γ and mouse anti-p110δ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Several other immunoreagents, including mouse anti-AKT-1 (protein kinase B), rabbit anti-phospho-AKT-1 (threonine 308), and rabbit anti-Gab-1, were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (LY294002) was obtained from Calbiochem. Rooster comb hyaluronan (HA) was purchased from Sigma. High molecular mass HA polymers (∼106 Da) were purified by gel filtration column chromatography using a Sephacryl S1000 column as described previously (18Lokeshwar V.B. Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23853-23864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The purity of high molecular weight HA polymers used in our experiments was further verified by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. No small HA fragments was detected in these preparations. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of CD44 Cytoplasmic Domain (CD44cyt) from E. coli—The cytoplasmic domain of human CD44 (CD44cyt) was cloned into pFLAG-AST using the PCR-based cloning strategy (15Zhu D. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using human CD44 cDNA as template, one PCR primer pair (left, FLAG-EcoRI; right, FLAG-XbaI) was designed to amplify complete CD44 cytoplasmic domain. The amplified DNA fragments were one-step-cloned into a pCR2.1 vector and sequenced. Then, the DNA fragments were cut out by doub"

In the present study, we have focused on the mechanism by which SOD1 is partitioned between cytosolic and mitochondrial pools. Using in vitro mitochondrial import assays, we show that only a very immature form of the SOD1 polypeptide that is apo for both copper and zinc can efficiently enter the mitochondria. Moreover, a conserved disulfide in SOD1 that is essential for activity must be reduced to facilitate mitochondrial uptake of SOD1. Once inside the mitochondria, SOD1 is converted to an active holo enzyme through the same post-translational modifications seen with cytosolic SOD1. The presence of high levels of CCS in the mitochondrial intermembrane space results in enhanced mitochondrial accumulation of SOD1, and this apparently involves CCS-mediated retention of SOD1 within mitochondria. This retention of SOD1 is not dependent on copper loading of the enzyme but does require protein-protein interactions at the heterodimerization interface of SOD1 and CCS as well as conserved cysteine residues in both molecules.

A mitochondrial location for SOD1 presumably protects against superoxide radicals released into the IMS by the respiratory chain (5Zhang L. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33972-33976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Structural studies reveal that all eukaryotic SOD1s are homodimeric proteins that contain one copper, one zinc, and one intrasubunit disulfide bond per monomer (17Bordo D. Djinovic K. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 366-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 18Bertini I. Mangani S. Viezzoli M.S. Sykes A.G. Advanced Inorganic Chemistry. Vol. 45.

Copper insertion into SOD1 is well understood and is mediated in vivo by CCS, the copper chaperone for SOD1 (20Culotta V.C. Klomp L. Strain J. Casareno R. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). CCS consists of three domains. N-terminal domain I is important for binding copper under conditions in which copper is limiting (21Schmidt P. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), as normally exists within the cell (22Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufhal R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Domain II possesses high homology with SOD1 and is important for target recognition of SOD1 by CCS, thus facilitating heterodimerization of the two proteins (23Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14720-14727Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Finally, the 30-amino acid C-terminal domain III of CCS contains two conserved cysteine residues (CXC) that bind copper and facilitate its insertion into the active site of SOD1 (21Schmidt P. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). One of these cysteines is capable of forming an intermolecular disulfide bond with a conserved cysteine in SOD1 as part of the heterodimeric CCS-SOD1 complex (24Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Our previous work showed that a fraction of yeast CCS co-localizes with SOD1 in the IMS of the mitochondria. Moreover, CCS appears to greatly influence the subcellular distribution of yeast SOD1 (10Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the fraction of CCS that localizes to the mitochondria was reduced, mitochondrial SOD1 levels were also lowered. Likewise, when the bulk of CCS was targeted to the mitochondrial IMS, SOD1 protein levels in the IMS were greatly increased (10Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which CCS influences mitochondrial accumulation of SOD1 is not understood. Does CCS facilitate the transport of SOD1 across the outer mitochondrial membrane, or does the copper chaperone act at a later step to help retain the enzyme within the IMS? Furthermore, what is the physical state of SOD1 that enters the mitochondria? With the various post-translational modifications of the enzyme, any number of SOD1 “microstates” are possible substrates for mitochondrial uptake. In the present study, we have examined how the mitochondrial localization of SOD1 is affected by its physical state and by its copper chaperone, CCS. We demonstrate that only an immature form of SOD1, lacking both copper and zinc and possessing a reduced disulfide, is eligible for mitochondrial entry. Moreover, CCS modulates the mitochondrial accumulation of SOD1 by apparently increasing retention of the enzyme within the IMS, without affecting the mitochondrial uptake of SOD1. Once inside the mitochondria, SOD1 is subject to the same post-translational maturation steps as cytosolic SOD1. Yeast Strains and Culture Conditions—Strain LS101 (MATα leu 2-3, 112 his3Δ1 trp1-289 ura3-52 sod1Δ::TRP1 lys7Δ::URA3) (10Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Transformation of LS101 followed the lithium acetate procedure (25Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). All of the strains and transformants were propagated at 30 °C using enriched yeast extract, peptone-based medium supplemented with 2% glucose (YPD) or minimal synthetic dextrose medium (26Sherman F.

Plasmids—Plasmids pLS101 (LEU2 CEN) expressing SOD1, pLS113 (HIS3 CEN) expressing native yeast CCS, and pLS117 (HIS3 CEN) expressing yeast CCS fused to the IMS-targeting sequence of cytochrome b 2 (10Sturtz L.A.

Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were described previously. The mutant yeast SOD1 expressing plasmids pLS119 (H46A,H48A), pLS130 (F50E,G51E), pLS131 (C57S), pLS132 (C146S), and pLS133 (C57S,C146S) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the SOD1 expression plasmid pLS101. pLS117 expressing the cytochrome b 2-CCS fusion was also mutagenized to produce plasmids pLS026 (C229S with respect to the natural CCS start codon), pLS027 (C231S), and pLS009 (C229S,C231S). All of the mutagenesis reactions were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Sequence integrity was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Johns Hopkins University Core Facility). Purification of SOD1 and Determination of Metal and Disulfide Status—Expression of yeast SOD1 in Escherichia coli BL21 and cell lysis were previously described (28Lamb A.L. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1589-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The proteins were precipitated by 50 to 75% ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was collected, redissolved, and desalted using the HiPrep™ Desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). Yeast SOD1 protein was purified using an anion-exchange column (Uno-Q12; Bio-Rad) and a MonoQ™ HR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined with a calibrated Bradford (Bio-Rad) curve with immunoglobulin G as the standard and by monitoring the absorption at 280 nm using 1490 m–1 cm–1/monomer as the extinction coefficient (29Lyons T.J. Nerissian A. Goto J.J. Zhu H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 650-662Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fully reduced and demetallated yeast SOD1 (E,ESH) was prepared by treating the as isolated yeast SOD1 protein with dithiothreitol to reduce the disulfide bond and adding EDTA, BCS, and N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine and organic solvents (15% CH3CN, 10% CH3OH) to remove bound metals. 2Y. Furukawa, A. S. Torres, and T. V. O'Halloran, submitted for publication. Metal content of E,ESH was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, ICP-AES, using a Thermo Jarrell Ash Atomscan model 25 Sequential ICP Spectrometer. E,ZnSH and Cu,ZnS-S were prepared by adding equimolar amounts of ZnSO4 and CuSO4 where appropriate in a glove box for 1 or 2 h, respectively, at 37 °C. Unbound metals were removed using a Centrifugal Filtration Device (Millipore). The metal contents were verified by ICP-AES. E,ES-S and E,ZnS-S were prepared by the addition of 10-fold molar excess of ferricyanide to the solution of E,ESH and E,ZnSH, respectively. Excess oxidant was removed with a Centrifugal Filtration Device, and the metal content was determined by ICP-AES. The thiol-disulfide status of the purified SOD1s was determined by chemical modification with the thiol-specific reagent 4-acetamide-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (Molecular Probes, Inc.). 4-Acetamide-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid conjugation results in an ∼1-kDa increase in the molecular mass of SOD1SH as visualized by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The increase in molecular mass was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In Vitro Mitochondrial Import Assays—Yeast cells lacking endogenous SOD1 were grown with aeration to mid-late log phase in YPD at 30 °C. The cells were harvested, and the mitochondria were isolated as described (30Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondria were resuspended in import buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm KH2PO4, and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0) (31Glick B.S. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 100-μl in vitro import reactions generally included 100 μg of crude mitochondria, 200 or 400 ng of purified SOD1 protein, and 2 mm NADH. Although NADH is generally prescribed for in vitro import reactions, we found that it is not needed for mitochondrial uptake of SOD1. Because treatment of mitochondria with the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone did not perturb SOD1 import (not shown), mitochondrial uptake of SOD1 appears to be independent of a membrane potential, as has been shown with other IMS proteins that lack cleavable presequences (32Diekert K.

The in vitro import reaction proceeded for 1 h at 30 °C, and mitochondria were then pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The SOD1 that did not enter the mitochondria was effectively removed by washing the mitochondria three times with 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS buffer containing 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (to prevent nonspecific binding of SOD1 to the mitochondrial outer membrane). The washed pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of this same buffer. SDS loading dye and dithiothreitol were added to all of the samples. The samples were vortexed for 1 min, boiled for ∼5 min, and filtered through Spin-x centrifuge tube filters (0.22-μm membrane; Corning Inc.) prior to analysis of mitochondrial uptake of SOD1 by SDS-PAGE on 14% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and Western blotting. Mitochondrial Retention of SOD1—The mitochondria were isolated from cells containing SOD1 but expressing different levels of CCS. The samples containing 100 μg of mitochondria in 1 ml of import buffer supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 2 mm NADH were incubated at 30 °C for 0 or 60 min to allow for any possible exit/loss of SOD1 from the mitochondria. Following incubation, 40-μl aliquots of all samples were taken to compare the total SOD1 in the 60-min samples with that in the 0-min samples (as in Fig. 3D). The mitochondria remaining in both samples were then reisolated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and washed once with 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to identify the portion of SOD1 retained within mitochondria (as in Fig. 3C). All of the samples were processed as detailed above for gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting for SOD1. For in vivo studies (Figs. 3A and 4, 5, 6), SOD1 and CCS protein levels in the postmitochondrial supernatant (PMS) and mitochondria were analyzed according to cell equivalents and monitored by immunoblot as previously described (10Sturtz L.A.

SOD enzymatic activity in PMS and mitochondrial fractions was assayed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and nitro blue tetrazolium staining (10Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R.

Mitochondria isolated from sod1Δ strains of yeast were incubated with various forms of purified yeast SOD1, and following import, the SOD1 that failed to enter the mitochondria was removed by extensive washing. (SOD1 is highly resistant to the protease treatment generally used to remove protein not taken up by mitochondria during in vitro import (31Glick B.S. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).) The SOD1 that was internalized by the mitochondria was monitored by immunoblotting. Using the aforementioned in vitro import assay, we tested the effects of SOD1 metallation on transport into mitochondria. The experiment of Fig. 1 utilized purified SOD1 that was stripped of both copper and zinc (E,E) and, where indicated, reconstituted with both metals. As seen in Fig. 1A (top panel), only the completely apo form of the enzyme lacking both metals was taken up by isolated mitochondria in the in vitro import assay, even though equal amounts of apo and metallated protein were added to the reaction (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). To verify that SOD1 actually entered the mitochondria, we monitored the mitochondrial IMS by hypotonic rupture of the mitochondrial outer membrane (36Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The endogenous CCS of the mitochondrial IMS was used as a marker, and as seen in Fig. 1B (top panel), a good fraction of this IMS protein was released to the supernatant when mitochondria from the in vitro import reaction were incubated under hypotonic conditions (lanes 4 and 5). 3It is generally difficult to obtain complete recovery of IMS proteins from in vitro import mitochondria isolated from glucose grown cells (R. Jensen, personal communication). By comparison, there was no release of CCS when these mitochondria were incubated and washed in the same buffer supplemented with sucrose (lanes 2 and 3). As seen in Fig. 1B (bottom panel), the exogenously added SOD1 followed precisely the same fractionation pattern as the endogenous CCS of the IMS, only being released from the mitochondria under hypotonic conditions, indicating that the SOD1 and CCS are in the same IMS compartment. As with other IMS proteins that lack a presequence for mitochondrial import (e.g. cytochrome c), (32Diekert K. Kroon A.I.D. Ahting U. Niggemeyer B. Neupert W. Kruijff B.D. Lill R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5626-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Lill R. Stuart R.A. Drygas M.E. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 34Steiner H. Zollner A. Haid A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 39: 22842-22849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar) the in vitro uptake of SOD1 into mitochondria appeared to occur independently of a mitochondrial membrane potential (data not shown; see “Experimental Procedures”). To further delineate the physical state of SOD1 that enters mitochondria, we tested in the in vitro import assay forms of SOD1 that contained zinc but lacked copper. With three different preparations of the zinc-only enzyme (E,Zn), zinc binding to the protein hindered the ability of SOD1 to enter the mitochondria in the in vitro assay (Fig. 2A, top panel, compare lanes 2 and 4, lanes 3 and 5, and lanes 8 and 9). Although the degree of inhibition by zinc differed with the three protein preparations, this seemed to correlate well with the percentage of zinc occupancy in the enzyme (Fig. 2B). Therefore, zinc binding alone appears to inhibit the mitochondrial uptake of SOD1. Moreover, the additional binding of copper further prevents SOD1 uptake (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 10). These effects of metallation on mitochondrial uptake are seen regardless of whether the mitochondria contain CCS (Fig. 2A, top left panel) or not (top right panel). SOD1 contains a well conserved intramolecular disulfide bond between cysteines 57 and 146 (17Bordo D. Djinovic K. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 366-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To assess the impact of this disulfide on mitochondrial import, we prepared forms of the apo and zinc-only enzyme that contained either reduced or oxidized disulfides and tested these for mitochondrial uptake. It was not possible to analyze the reduced form of the copper and zinc enzyme because copper ion itself is generally an efficient oxidant for disulfide formation (37Kachur A.V. Koch C.J. Biaglow J.E. Free Radical Res. 1999; 31: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2A (top panel), oxidation of these cysteines to form the disulfide greatly reduced the uptake of SOD1 by the mitochondria (compare lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 4 and 5) even in the completely apo form of the protein. The observed differences in protein uptake by the mitochondria are not due to differences in the amount of the various forms of SOD1 added to the import reactions (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Overall, these in vitro import assays indicate that mitochondrial entry of SOD1 is optimized when SOD1 lacks both copper and zinc and has reduced cysteines at positions 57 and 146. The Role of CCS in Mitochondrial Accumulation of SOD1—We examined how CCS may influence the mitochondrial accumulation of SOD1. As seen in the in vivo studies of Fig. 3A, SOD1 still localizes to the mitochondria of yeast lys7Δ cells lacking CCS. This is consistent with our in vitro import assays (Fig. 2A, right panels; Fig. 3B) demonstrating that CCS is not needed for mitochondrial uptake of SOD1. However, the yield of in vivo mitochondrial SOD1 is often reduced in cells lacking CCS (Fig. 3A) and in certain instances, even difficult to detect (10Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may reflect the loss of SOD1 from the mitochondria when CCS is absent (see below). Although CCS is not essential for the mitochondrial uptake of SOD1, the levels of mitochondrial SOD1 are greatly increased when cells express high levels of mitochondrial CCS. As we have previously shown, the targeting of CCS to the mitochondrial IMS through the use of the cytochrome b 2 presequence (Cyt b 2-CCS) resulted in a dramatic increase in mitochondrial SOD1 accumulation in vivo (Fig. 3A, top panel, compare lanes 4 and 6). There are two potential explanations for how high mitochondrial CCS could increase mitochondrial levels of SOD1. The first possibility is a “dragging-in” effect, in which CCS on the outside of mitochondria facilitates SOD1 entry, perhaps through a co-transport mechanism. However, in our preliminary in vitro import assays for SOD1, we failed to detect any increase in SOD1 import when purified CCS was added to the outside of mitochondria (data not shown). The second possibility is a “retention” effect, in which CCS inside the mitochondria helps retain the SOD1 that enters the IMS. To investigate this possibility, we conducted in vitro import assays for apo and reduced SOD1 using mitochondria that contained varying levels of CCS. As shown in Fig. 3B, with increasing levels of CCS inside the mitochondria, there was also a moderate increase in the amount of SOD1 accumulated by mitochondria in vitro, suggesting that CCS may help retain SOD1 inside the mitochondria. Although the presence of mitochondrial CCS moderately affected mitochondrial accumulation of SOD1 in vitro (Fig. 3B), the effect was not nearly as strong as that seen with mitochondrial CCS in vivo (Fig. 3A). This may reflect the fact that CCS does not efficiently activate SOD1 following in vitro mitochondrial import, because we cannot detect enzymatic activity under these conditions (data not shown). One or more factors necessary for SOD1 activation (e.g. proper mitochondrial sources for zinc and copper and conditions for disulfide oxidation, see below) appear to be lost from the isolated mitochondria used for in vitro import. To further test the possible role of CCS in mitochondrial retention of SOD1, we employed mitochondria that had accumulated active SOD1 enzyme in vivo. Mitochondria isolated from cells expressing SOD1 and various levels of mitochondrial CCS (as in Fig. 3A) were either placed on ice (Fig. 3C, lanes 1, 3, and 5) or incubated for 1 h to allow for any possibl"
https://openalex.org/W2158772522,"An 18-amino acid peptide in tomato leaves called systemin is a primary signal released at wound sites in response to herbivory that systemically signals the activation of defense genes throughout the plants. We report here the isolation of three hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides from tomato leaves, of 20, 18, and 15 amino acids in length, that signal the activation of defense genes, similar to the activity of the systemin peptide. The three new peptides cause an alkalinization of suspension-cultured cells and induce the synthesis of defensive proteinase inhibitor proteins when supplied at fmol levels to young tomato plants through their cut stems. This suggests that they are part of the wound signaling of tomato plants that activates defense against herbivores and pathogens. Isolation of cDNAs coding for the tomato peptides revealed that they are all derived from the same pre-proprotein precursor that is systemically wound-inducible. The peptides are considered members of the functionally characterized systemin family of defense signals from plants that are synthesized both in wounded leaves and in distal, unwounded leaves in response to herbivory or other mechanical wounding. The precursor deduced from the cDNA exhibits a leader sequence, indicating that it is synthesized through the secretory pathway, where it is hydroxylated and glycosylated. The amino acid sequence of the precursor exhibited weak identity to the precursor of two hydroxyproline-rich defense signals recently found in tobacco, suggesting that the two pre-protein precursors have evolved from a common ancestral protein. The identification of hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein systemins in tomato indicates that the initiation of wound signaling is more complex than previously thought and appears to involve multiple peptide signals.

The identification of hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein systemins in tomato indicates that the initiation of wound signaling is more complex than previously thought and appears to involve multiple peptide signals. In 1972, a herbivore-induced systemic defense response was first documented biochemically by the demonstration that insects chewing on tomato leaves caused the release of a systemic signal that induced the synthesis of proteinase inhibitor proteins throughout the plants (1Green T.R. Ryan C.A. Science. 1972; 175: 776-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Proteinase inhibitors are among the front line defenses of plants that can upset protein digestion of herbivores that consume them (2Ryan C.A. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1990; 28: 425-449Crossref Google Scholar). These observations led to a search for the “proteinase inhibitor-inducing factor” in leaves of tomato plants, resulting in the discovery that an 18-amino acid peptide called systemin is a key signal for the systemic activation of defense genes in response to pest attacks (3Pearce G. Strydom D. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. Science. 1991; 253: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar).Tomato systemin is a proline-rich peptide that is derived from the C-terminal region of a 200-amino acid proprotein precursor called prosystemin (4McGurl B. Pearce G. Orozco-Cardenas M. Ryan C.A. Science. 1992; 255: 1570-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) in response to herbivore attacks or other severe wounding. Expression of the prosystemin gene in its antisense orientation in tomato plants effectively blocks the systemic synthesis of defense genes, demonstrating a key role for the peptide in distal signaling (4McGurl B. Pearce G. Orozco-Cardenas M. Ryan C.A. Science. 1992; 255: 1570-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Systemin and its precursor have been identified in several Solanaceae species, including black nightshade, potato, and bell pepper from the tribe Solaneae (5Hunziker A.T. The Genera of Solanaceae. A. R. G. Gantner Verlag K. G., Berlin2001Google Scholar). Tobacco, another member of the Solanaceae family but from the subtribe Nicotianae, does not express a gene homologous to tomato systemin and does not have a strong leaf-to-leaf systemic signaling system (6Constabel C.P. Yip L. Ryan C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 26: 55-62Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It does, however, have a strong defense response in leaves that are wounded (7Pearce G. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and a strong leaf-to-root signaling system (8Zhang Z.-P. Baldwin I.T. Planta. 1997; 203: 436-441Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A search for the localized defense signals in tobacco leaves resulted in the discovery of two 18-amino acid hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides that are potent inducers of proteinase inhibitors in leaves of tobacco plants (9Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The peptides were recently named tobacco hydroxyproline-rich systemins (TobHypSys I and II) 1The abbreviations used are: TobHypSys, tobacco hydroxyproline-rich systemin(s); TomHypSys, tomato hydroxyproline-rich systemin(s); TFA, trifluoroacetic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry; RALF, rapid alkalinization factor.1The abbreviations used are: TobHypSys, tobacco hydroxyproline-rich systemin(s); TomHypSys, tomato hydroxyproline-rich systemin(s); TFA, trifluoroacetic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry; RALF, rapid alkalinization factor. (10Pearce, G., and Ryan, C. A. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar) as their discovery functionally broadened the definition of systemins to include any signaling peptide from plants that activates plant defensive genes. The two tobacco peptides are processed from a single pre-protein precursor, analogous to the origins of some peptide hormones in animals.Evidence for localized defensive wound signals in tomato plants that are independent of systemin was obtained when analyzing tomato plants expressing an antisense tomato prosystemin gene (4McGurl B. Pearce G. Orozco-Cardenas M. Ryan C.A. Science. 1992; 255: 1570-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The plants lack systemic signaling but do exhibit a strong localized defense response. We report herein that a search for additional peptide signals in tomato leaves has resulted in the isolation of three hydroxyproline-rich, glycosylated peptides, of 20, 18, and 15 amino acids in length, that are powerful inducers of defense responses in tomato cell cultures and leaves and appear to have roles in the amplification of mobile wound signals. The isolation of cDNAs coding for the three peptides revealed that all three peptides are derived from a single wound-inducible pre-proprecursor protein of 146 amino acids in length. This precursor shares weak amino acid identities with a pre-proprecursor of tobacco defense peptides in its N- and C-terminal regions, suggesting that the tobacco and tomato precursors may have been derived from a common ancestral gene. This is the first report in plants of three peptide signals being derived from a single precursor, a scenario common to animals and yeast, and indicates that defensive wound signaling in tomato plants may involve multiple peptide signals.MATERIALS AND METHODSAlkalinization Assay—Tomato suspension cells were maintained in Murashige and Skoog media as described previously (11Scheer J. Ryan C.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but excluding buffer, with the media adjusted to pH 5.6 with KOH. Cultures were maintained by transferring 3 ml of cells to 45 ml of media every 7 days with shaking at 160 rpm. Tomato cells were used for alkalinization assays 4–7 days after transfer. One h before assaying for alkalinating activity, 1-ml aliquots of cells were transferred into each well of 24-well cell-culture cluster plates and allowed to equilibrate at 160 rpm. Fractions from various separation procedures (1–10 μl) were added to the cells, and the increase in pH of the media was recorded after 20 min.Proteinase Inhibitor-inducing Assay—Tomato plants were grown in growth chambers under 17-h light (28 °C) and 7-h dark (17 °C) conditions.

Ryan C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Solutions of peptides were supplied to excised tomato plants through their cut stems for 45 min, and the plants were transferred to 20-ml vials containing water and incubated in closed Plexiglas boxes for 24 h at 200 microeinsteins m–2s–1. The juice was expressed from the leaves using a mortar and pestle and then assayed for proteinase inhibitor II content.Polypeptide Isolation—Ten tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum var. Castlemart) were grown under greenhouse conditions for approximately 8 weeks. Before the onset of fruit, the plants were sprayed with methyl jasmonate as described previously (9Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Fifteen h later, the leaves were collected, ground in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –20 °C. Frozen leaf material (2 kg) was homogenized in a 4-liter blender for 2 min using 2.4 liters of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as the extraction solvent. The liquid was squeezed through four layers of cheesecloth and one layer of Miracloth (Calbiochem) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The acidic supernatant was adjusted to pH 4.5 with 10 n NaOH and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. After re-adjusting the supernatant to a pH of 2.5 with TFA, the liquid was applied to a 40-μm 3 × 25 mm C18 reversed-phase flash column (Bondesil, Varian Analytical Instruments, Walnut Creek, CA) equilibrated with 0.1% TFA/H2O. Elution was performed at 8 p.s.i. with compressed nitrogen gas. The column was eluted with 100 ml of 0.1% TFA/H2O and then 250 ml of 40% methanol/0.1% TFA. The fraction eluting with 40% methanol was vacuum-evaporated to remove methanol and then lyophilized to dryness, yielding 11.5 g from five duplicated preparations (50 plants total). One-third of the dry powder was dissolved in 10 ml of 0.1% TFA/H2O, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and applied to a Sephadex G-25 column (4 × 40 cm) equilibrated with 0.1% TFA/H2O. Fractions (8 ml) were collected, and the alkalinating activity was assayed as described above using 10 μl/fraction. The activity was found in fractions at or near the void, which were pooled and lyophilized. The yield from three duplicate runs was about 400 mg of dry weight. This preparation was called the “lyophilized crude extract.” This material was dissolved in 10 ml of 0.1% TFA/H2O (40 mg/ml) for semipreparative reversed-phase C18-HPLC. After centrifugation and filtration, the components from 10 sequential 40-mg samples were separated on the column (218TP510, 5-μm 10 × 250 mm column, Vydac, Hesperia, CA) with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. After 2 min, a gradient was applied from 0–40% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA over 90 min. The absorbance was monitored at 220 nm. Fractions eluting at 1-min intervals were collected, and 10-μl aliquots were used with 1 ml of tomato suspension-cultured cells to determine the alkalinating activity in each fraction. After further purification, six peaks were identified, and partial amino acid sequence analyses of the individual components were determined. Two peaks corresponded to the systemin sequence (3Pearce G. Strydom D. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. Science. 1991; 253: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), whereas a later eluting, large peak was the previously identified RALF peptide (15Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12843-12847Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This peptide is not involved with defense but with cell division and elongation. The remaining three peaks were composed of multiple peptide components and were further purified. Fractions 29–33 (peaks 1 and 2) and fractions 49–52 (peak 3) were pooled and lyophilized. The combined yields for peaks 1 and 2, called Fraction I, was 33 mg, and the yield for peak 3, called Fraction II, was 22 mg. Each fraction was subjected to strong cation exchange chromatography on a PolySULFOETHYL Aspartamide™ column (5-μm 4.6 × 200 mm column, The Nest Group, Southborough, MA) equilibrated with 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 3, in 25% acetonitrile. After dissolving Fraction I in 3 ml of buffer and Fraction II in 2 ml of buffer, the solutions were analyzed separately by sequentially loading 1-ml samples onto the column (three separations for Fraction I and two for Fraction II). Two min after applying the sample to the column, a 90-min gradient was applied to 40% elution buffer consisting of 5 mm potassium phosphate, 500 mm potassium chloride, pH 3, in 25% acetonitrile. Absorbance was monitored at 220 nm at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. A 2-μl aliquot from each fraction was assayed with the suspension-cultured cells. Two peaks of alkalinization activity were identified among the components eluting from the separation profile of Fraction I. An initial peak, called Peak 1, eluted at 56–61 min, and a smaller peak, called Peak 2, eluted at 79–82 min. Fraction II contained one major activity peak that eluted at 59–63 min and was called Peak 3. Fractions from each peak were pooled, lyophilized, and further purified after dissolving each in 1-ml column equilibration buffer, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, and clarifying by centrifugation. The centrifugates were individually applied to a reversed-phase C18 HPLC column (218TP54, 5-μm 4.6 × 250 mm column, Vydac) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After 2 min, a 90-min gradient was applied to 40% elution buffer consisting of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, in 50% acetonitrile for Peaks 1 and 2 and was applied to 60% elution buffer for Peak 3. Absorbance was monitored at 220 nm. Two-μl aliquots were used to determine alkalinating activity; Peak 1 eluted at 45–52 min, Peak 2 at 44–47 min, and Peak 3 at 46–50 min. These were pooled and lyophilized. Further purification was carried out on the analytical C18 column used above but using TFA/methanol as the elution solvent. The lyophilized peaks were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1% TFA/H2O and centrifuged, and the supernatants were loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After 2 min, a 90-min gradient was applied from 0–40% methanol/0.05% TFA for Peak 1, from 0–35% methanol/0.05% TFA for Peak 2, and from 0–70% methanol/0.05% TFA for Peak 3. One-min fractions were collected, and the absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. Alkalinating activity was determined with 2 μl. Peak 1 eluted as a doublet at 41–49 min, which was called Peaks 1a and 1b. Peak 2 eluted at 65–68 min, and Peak 3 eluted at 56–59 min. Peak 2 was pure as judged by MALDI-MS analysis. Its yield was quantified from its peak area eluting from a narrow bore C18 HPLC column using known peptide standards. The yield was 190 pmol.The early eluting peak of the Peak 1 doublet, Peak 1a, eluted at 42–44 min, whereas Peak 1b eluted at 46–48 min. To further purify Peaks 1a and 1b as well as Peak 3, the analytical C18 column separation was repeated using the pH 6 buffer system but with shallower gradients of 0–30% for Peaks 1a and 1b and 0–40% for Peak 3. Alkalinization activity was assayed using 2 μl from each fraction, identifying Peak 1a in fractions 48–50 and Peak 1b in fractions 52–54. Peak 3 eluted in fractions 64–65. The peaks were pooled and lyophilized. The peaks were further purified and quantified by dissolving in 1 ml of 0.1% TFA/H20 and were loaded onto a narrow bore reversed-phase C18-HPLC column (218TP52, 5-μm 2.1 × 250 mm column, Vydac). After 2 min, a 90-min gradient was applied from 0–25% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA for Peaks 1a and 1b and from 0–35% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA for Peak 3. The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min, and absorbance was monitored at 210 nm. Alkalinization activity was assayed by adding 1 μl of each fraction to 1 ml of tomato cells. The activity was found in fractions 58–59 (Peak 1a), fractions 61–62 (Peak 1b), and fractions 72–73 (Peak 3). These were pooled and quantified by their peak areas relative to known quantities of synthetic TobHypSys I and II (9Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The yields for Peaks 1a, 1b, and 3 were 680, 400, and 340 pmol, respectively.Peptide Sequence Analyses and Synthesis—N-terminal sequencing was performed using Edman chemistry on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Procise Model 492 protein sequencer. MALDI spectra were obtained using a PerSeptive Biosystems (Framington, MA) Voyager time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). α-Cyano-4-hyroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) was used as the matrix. Carboxypeptidase P was used to confirm the C-terminal HQ sequence of Peak 1 as described (9Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Peptide synthesis was performed using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry by solid-phase techniques with an Applied Biosystems Model 431 synthesizer as described previously (15Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12843-12847Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate analysis was performed by mild acid hydrolysis and MALDI-MS analysis as described previously (9Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).cDNA Isolation—An expressed sequence tag search of The Institute for Genomic Research tomato (L. esculentum) gene index revealed a protein that contained sequences for both Peaks 1 and 3, fused to a sequence of β-tubulin (BG629139). Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the sequence coding for the two peptides by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. This provided a probe to identify the cDNA in a tomato leaf cDNA library. The GenBank™ accession number of the TomHypSys precursor cDNA is AY292201.Northern Blot Analyses—Leaves of treated and control plants (12 days old) were removed and immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C until extraction. Each treatment consisted of four leaves, one each from separate plants. The leaf material was ground to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle with liquid N2 and extracted using Triazol buffer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was quantitated, and 15 μg of each sample was fractionated by electrophoresis in 1.4% agarose-formaldehyde gels, blotted on nylon membranes, and hybridized with [32P]dCTP-specific probes at 62 °C. An 18 S RNA was used as a loading control. Membranes were washed twice with 2× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA for 20 min at room temperature followed by 40-min washes at 62 °C in 2× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 1% SDS and 1× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 1% SDS and then were exposed to x-ray film for 15 h to 3 days at –80 °C.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA crude soluble tomato leaf preparation enriched in small peptides was employed to search for defense-signaling peptides in tomato leaves. The search was initiated as a result of the development of a novel, rapid assay that had identified previously two defense-signaling peptides in tobacco leaf extracts (9Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the response of suspension-cultured cells to peptide ligands that interact with receptors leading to the inhibition of a membrane proton ATPase, causing an increase in pH of the culture medium (16Meindl T. Boller T. Felix G. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The assay is called the “medium alkalinization assay,” for which only a few μl of fractions eluting from columns are required.The peptides present in the tomato leaf extracts were separated on a C18 reversed-phase HPLC column and assayed for the presence of alkalinating activities in the eluted peaks. Several active peaks were obtained (Fig. 1). Two of the activity peaks contained systemin peptides, identified by their N-terminal sequences (3Pearce G. Strydom D. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. Science. 1991; 253: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), and another activity peak was RALF, a 5-kDa, receptor-mediated peptide that is not involved in plant defense (15Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12843-12847Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The three other activity peaks (labeled 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 1) were mixtures of peptides that required further purification. The active components in these peaks were purified with a series of HPLC columns, similar to the protocols utilized for the purification of tomato and tobacco defense peptides (see “Materials and Methods”) (3Pearce G. Strydom D. Johnson S. Ryan C.A. Science. 1991; 253: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 9Pearce G. Moura D.S. Stratmann J. Ryan C.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Peak 1 was separated into two bioactive peaks, Peaks 1a and 1b, whereas the other two peaks, Peaks 2 and 3, were composed of single components. The yields of peptides from 10 kg of tomato leaves, quantified by comparing peak areas with those of known quantities of a synthetic tobacco systemin standard, were estimated to be 680 pmol for Peak 1a, 400 pmol for Peak 1b, 190 pmol for Peak 2, and 340 pmol for Peak 3.MALDI-MS analysis of Peak 1a revealed a major peak at 4191 mass units with a ladder of lower mass peaks indicative of a peptide having different numbers of pentose residues attached (Δ132 mass units) (Fig. 2A, top). After mild acid hydrolysis to release carbohydrates from the main chain, one major peak was found having a mass of 2076 mass units (Fig. 2A, bottom). The mass difference between 4191 and 2076 mass units suggests that the largest glycosylated species in Peak 1 contains 16 pentose units. The masses found for the various other species present in Peak 1 indicate that a single peptide backbone is decorated with 12–17 pentose units.Fig. 2MALDI-mass spectral analysis of components in purified peaks. Each peak was analyzed before (upper panels) and after (lower panels) acid hydrolysis to remove attached carbohydrates. A, Peak 1a; B, Peak 1b; C, Peak 2; D, Peak 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Peak 1b revealed a major peak at 3531 mass units and a ladder of species containing various numbers of pentose residues (Fig. 2B, top). Upon hydrolysis, one major peak appeared at 2076 mass units, as with Peak 1a (Fig. 2B, bottom). The mass differences among the various species indicate that 11 pentose residues are present in the largest component of Peak 1b, with a range of 8 to 13 pentose units. In mass spectrometry profiles of both Peaks 1a and 1b, a fragment with a mass of 1947 was present that has not been identified. This mass is 129 mass units smaller than the major 2076 mass peak found with both Peaks 1a and 1b and may be the 2076-mass unit peptide lacking a C-terminal glutamine. Peaks 1a and 1b exhibited identical N-terminal amino acid sequences and identical activities in the alkalinization assay (data not shown). These two peaks were subsequently pooled and treated as a single peptide with varying quantities of carbohydrate attachments.MALDI-MS analysis of Peak 2 revealed a mass of 4513 mass units with a ladder of species ranging from 3985 to 4645 mass units, differing by Δ132 mass units (Fig. 2C, top). Upon acid hydrolysis, the spectra revealed a major peak at 2530 mass units and a minor peak at 2368 mass units, a difference of 162 mass units, which is the predicted mass of a hexose that remained after hydrolysis (Fig. 2C, bottom). Peak 2, by difference of 4513 and 2368 mass units, appears to be decorated with 12–16 pentose residues and one hexose residue.Peak 3 had a major mass peak of 2954 mass units before hydrolysis with minor peaks at 2822 and 2689 mass units, revealing minor species that represented a pentose ladder (Fig. 2D, top). Upon hydrolysis, a major peak resulted at 1651 mass units (Fig. 2D, bottom), a loss of 1303 mass units that does not provide an integer value when divided by the pentose molecular weight of 132 mass units. However, after a short 1-h hydrolysis, a series of mass peaks resulted (data not shown) that indicated the presence of nine pentoses of 132 mass units and one of 113 mass units. The identity of the 113-mass unit fragment is unknown but may be an anhydropentose.Specific activities of the three glycopeptides in the alkalinization assay were determined and compared with the specific activity of tomato systemin (Fig. 3A). Peaks 1 and 3 displayed virtually the same specific activities as systemin, with a half-maximal activity at concentrations of about 0.25 nm. Peak 2, however, induced a much weaker alkalinization response, with a half-maximal activity at concentrations near 2 nm. Comparisons of the time courses of alkalinization of the three peptides with systemin at 1-nm concentrations (Fig. 3B) also indicated that peptides from Peaks 1 and 3 more rapidly caused alkalinization of the cell medium than the peptide from Peak 2. To assess whether the three peptides could activate a defense response in planta, each peptide was supplied to young, excised tomato plants through their cut stems, and the induction of proteinase inhibitor II protein in leaves was assessed 24 h later. This assay has been routinely used to assay the activity of systemin and other elicitors of defense gene expression in tomato plants. Supplying as little as 2.5 pmol of each peptide to tomato plants induced a maximal synthesis and accumulation of inhibitor II protein in leaves of tomato plants, similar to the activity of systemin (Fig. 4). A similar induction of proteinase inhibitor I protein was observed (data not shown).Fig. 3Concentration dependence in the alkalinization activities of the three purified glycosylated peptides derived from Peaks 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 1) compared with the alkalinization activity of systemin.

The extent to which mitochondria swell in response to accumulation of large Ca2+ loads also varies considerably with experimental conditions and with mitochondrial tissue type (25Andreyev A.

Brain Res. 2003; 960: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Brain mitochondria are particularly resistant to Ca2+-induced swelling (25Andreyev A. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 28Berman S.B. Watkins S.C. Hastings T.G. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 164: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); moreover, they represent many cell populations, which may explain their heterogeneous response to large Ca2+ loads and to inhibitors of the PTP, e.g. cyclosporin A (26Kristian T. Weatherby T.M. Bates T.E. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Brustovetsky N. Brustovetsky T. Jemmerson R. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In this study we report that 2-APB (30Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) prevents Ca2+-induced PTP in non-synaptosomal brain mitochondria in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP and Mg2+. 2-APB is reported to inhibit Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria in situ in Jurkat T cells following stimulation of cellular Ca2+ influx through activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry (31Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. 2001; 536: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, mitochondria transiently accumulate Ca2+, followed by release upon restoration of basal cytosolic Ca2+ levels. The investigators hypothesized that the inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux by 2-APB is because of inhibition of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (32Gunter T.E. Buntinas L. Sparagna G. Eliseev R. Gunter K. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Our results do not provide evidence for 2-APB inhibition of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger but do indicate that mCICR via the PTP is effectively inhibited. This effect of 2-APB on isolated non-synaptosomal brain mitochondria is observed both in the absence of adenine nucleotides, where inhibition of Ca2+-induced swelling is apparent, and in the presence of millimolar concentrations of ATP and magnesium, where swelling is not observed but where Ca2+ induces release of matrix metabolites and cytochrome c. In the presence of ATP, 2-APB-inhibitable Ca2+-induced mitochondrial alterations are not affected by most other PTP inhibitors, including cyclosporin A. Isolation of Mitochondria—Non-synaptic adult rat brain mitochondria were isolated on a Percoll gradient as described previously (33Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Male 300–350-g Sprague-Dawley rats were used for this study. All animal procedures were carried out according to the National Institutes of Health and the University of Maryland, Baltimore, animal care and use committee guidelines. Rats were sacrificed, and forebrains were rapidly removed, chopped, and homogenized in ice-cold isolation buffer containing 225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, and 1 mm EGTA with the pH adjusted to 7.4 using KOH. The brain homogenate was centrifuged at 1,250 × g for 3 min; the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 15% Percoll (Sigma) and layered on a preformed Percoll gradient (40 and 23%). After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 6 min, the mitochondrial fraction located at the interface of the lower two layers was removed, diluted with isolation buffer, and centrifuged at 16,600 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the loose pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer and centrifuged at 6700 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was suspended in 100 μl of isolation medium devoid of EGTA. Mitochondrial Ca2+ Uptake—Mitochondrial-dependent removal of medium Ca2+ was followed using the impermeant pentapotassium salt of the ratiometric dye Fura 6F (Molecular Probes, Portland, OR, USA). Fura 6F (250 nm) was added to a medium containing mitochondria (0.25 mg/ml) and 125 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm KH2PO4, 1 μm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 5 mm malate, and 5 mm glutamate with the pH adjusted to 7.08 with KOH. According to calculations using the Winmaxc software (34Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), the free [Mg2+] under these conditions is ∼1 mm. It was necessary to use Suprapur KCl (Merck) to minimize Ca2+ contamination, thereby also minimizing the amount of added EGTA necessary to eliminate deleterious effects of background Ca2+. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. Fluorescence intensity was measured in a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan) using 340/380-nm excitation and 510-nm emission wavelengths. The [Ca2+]in the medium was calculated using the ratio calibration approach described by Grynkiewicz et al. (35Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The K d for Fura 6F was estimated to be 2.47 μm using the calcium calibration buffer kit number 3 (Molecular Probes). An essentially identical value was obtained using the calcium calibration buffer kit number 2 with magnesium (Molecular Probes). Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Mitochondrial membrane potential was qualitatively assessed by TMRE (Molecular Probes) fluorescence intensity measured in a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer using 549- and 580-nm wavelengths for excitation and emission, respectively (37 °C). Because of the small Stokes shift, we assessed the effect of light scatter on the fluorescent signal, and it was found to be less than 10% as compared with TMRE fluorescence. 125 nm dye was added to a medium containing mitochondria (0.25 mg/ml) and 125 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm KH2PO4, 1 μm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 5 mm malate, and 5 mm glutamate with the pH adjusted to 7.08 using KOH. Oxygen Consumption—Mitochondrial respiration was recorded at 37 °C with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech, UK). The incubation medium contained 125 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm KH2PO4, 1 μm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm ADP, 5 mm malate, and 5 mm glutamate (or 5 mm succinate plus 1 μm rotenone) with the pH adjusted to 7.08 with KOH. In some experiments as indicated 5 mm succinate (plus 1 μm rotenone) replaced malate plus glutamate as the oxidizable substrate. State 3 (phosphorylating) respiration was initiated by the addition of mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) to the incubation medium. State 3 respiration was terminated and State 4 (resting) respiration was initiated by the addition of 2 μm oligomycin. Cytochrome c Release from Mitochondria—Aliquots of mitochondrial suspensions were taken at specified incubation times, and the mitochondria were separated from the suspending medium by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was carefully removed, and both the supernatant and mitochondrial pellet fractions were immediately frozen and stored at –20 °C. Cytochrome c immunoreactivity was quantified in both fractions using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Before measurement, the supernatant and pellet samples were diluted 1:40 and 1:80, respectively. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is expressed as the content of cytochrome c in the supernatant as a percentage of the total content of cytochrome c present in the supernatant plus pellet. NAD + + NADH Release from Mitochondria—Aliquots of mitochondrial suspensions were taken at specified incubation times, and mitochondria were separated from the suspending medium by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was carefully removed, and both the supernatant and mitochondrial pellet fractions were immediately frozen and stored at –20 °C. NAD+ plus NADH extraction from both fractions was performed according to the method described by Klingenberg (36Klingenberg M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. VCH Publishers, Inc., Deerfield Beach, FL1985: 251-269Google Scholar). Extracts were transferred to 2 ml of assay medium maintained at 30 °C containing 0.2 mg of alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma), 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.6 m ethanol, 50 mm Na4P2O7·10 H2O, pH 7.8. NADH fluorescence was followed in a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer using 340- and 460-nm wavelengths for excitation and emission, respectively. Mitochondrial Swelling—Swelling of isolated mitochondria was assessed by measuring light scatter at 660 nm (37 °C) in a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Mitochondria were added at a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml to 2 ml of medium containing 125 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm KH2PO4, 1 μm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm malate, and5mm glutamate with the pH adjusted to 7.08 with KOH. At the end of each experiment, the non-selective pore-forming peptide alamethicin (80 μg) was added as a calibration standard to cause maximal swelling. Reagents—Standard laboratory chemicals were from Sigma. 2-APB (Sigma), CGP 37157 (Calbiochem), cyclosporin A (Sigma), bongkrekic acid (Calbiochem), alamethicin (Sigma), tamoxifen (Sigma), spermine (Sigma), xestospongin C (Calbiochem), inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (ICN), thapsigargin (Calbiochem), trifluoperazine (Sigma), bromoenol lactone (Sigma), aristolochic acid (Biomol), bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 7-nitroindazole (Calbiochem), 1400W (Calbiochem), ubiquinone 0 (Sigma), butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma), N-acetylcysteine (Sigma), catalase (Sigma), and superoxide dismutase (Sigma). 2-APB Protects against Ca2+-induced Mitochondrial Swelling in the Absence of Adenine Nucleotides—Ca2+-induced swelling of brain mitochondria can be demonstrated, but typically, only if adenine nucleotides are omitted from the medium (26Kristian T. Weatherby T.M. Bates T.E. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, non-synaptosomal brain mitochondria exposed to 20 nmol of Ca2+ (40 nmol mg–1 protein) (Fig. 1a, curve a) exhibited a gradual decline in absorbance at 660 nm greater than that observed in the absence of added Ca2+ (Fig. 1a, curve d). The presence of cyclosporin A (2 μm) completely eliminated the Ca2+-dependent change in light scattering, indicating involvement of the PTP (Fig. 1a, curve b). 2-APB (100 μm) also eliminated the Ca2+-dependent light scattering (Fig. 1a, curve c). Because agents that block mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake also block mitochondrial swelling without necessarily affecting the PTP, the effect of 2-APB on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release was measured. After the addition of 20 nmol of Ca2+ to the mitochondrial suspension, Ca2+ uptake was faster in the presence of 2-APB than in its absence (Fig. 1b, thick versus thin line). Thus, in the absence of adenine nucleotides, both cyclosporin A and 2-APB are effective inhibitors of the Ca2+-induced PTP in brain mitochondria. Dose-dependent Inhibition of Mitochondrial Ca2+-induced Ca2+ Release by 2-APB in the Presence of ATP—After a demonstration that 2-APB is effective at inhibiting PTP in the absence of adenine nucleotides, subsequent experiments were performed in the presence of 3 mm ATP to model more physiologically relevant conditions. In the presence of ATP, brain mitochondria completely accumulated two additions of 400 nmol of Ca2+ and almost sequestered the third addition. This net uptake of more than 2000 nmol of Ca2+ mg–1 mitochondrial protein was followed by a slow release of Ca2+ back to the medium (Fig. 2, curve a). Mitochondria suspended in the presence of either 50 or 100 μm 2-APB accumulated the entire Ca2+ load (2400 nmol mg–1) without releasing Ca2+ during the course of the 20-min experiment (Fig. 2, curves c and d, respectively). The presence of even 10 μm 2-APB resulted in some inhibition of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 2, curve b). Fura 6F fluorescence responds reliably to [Ca2+] in the range of 0.5–50 μm (not shown). Each addition of Ca2+ to the mitochondrial suspension was a total of 200 μm; however, according to Winmaxc software (34Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), the calculated free [Ca2+] was <100 μm in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP. Therefore, the peak of the calcium signal before the onset of calcium uptake by mitochondria was underestimated. However, the method used (manual additions of calcium in a cuvette system) is limited in the temporal dimension of the millisecond scale, where much of the calcium uptake takes place, given the enormous avidity of the uniporter (V max > 1200 nmol Ca2+/mg of protein/min) and/or the rapid mode of uptake (37Sparagna G.C. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27510-27515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It is to be noted that even though the upper range of the bulk [Ca2+]i in cells reported by Fura 2 (or higher K d derivatives) fluorescence is in the relatively low micromolar range (38Stout A.K. Reynolds I.J. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), free [Ca2+]i may well reach the ∼100 μm range in certain microdomains (39Neher E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) such as the perimitochondrial environment (40Szalai G. Csordas G. Hantash B.M. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15305-15313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), (41Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E. Cuchillo-Ibanez I. Albillos A. Garcia A.G. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Comparison of 2-APB to Cyclosporin A and Bongkrekic Acid—Although cyclosporin A was effective at inhibiting the PTP in brain mitochondria in the absence of adenine nucleotides (Fig. 1a), it failed to inhibit mCICR in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3, curve b). Bongkrekic acid, another PTP inhibitor, exhibited an ability to inhibit mCICR in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3, curve c) that was very similar to that of 2-APB (Fig. 3, curve d). Because the vehicle for bongkrekic acid is 1 m NH4OH, an equal volume of vehicle was tested and found to have no effect on Ca2+ uptake and retention (not shown). Although 2-APB inhibited mCICR, it did cause a slight reduction in the rate of Ca2+ uptake, particularly after the third addition of Ca2+ (Fig. 3, curve d). The effects of 2-APB on mitochondrial bioenergetics were further analyzed using measurements of both mitochondrial membrane potential and O2 consumption. Protection by 2-APB against Ca2+-induced Loss of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential— Fig. 4 provides a qualitative evaluation of ΔΨ after the addition of high Ca2+ loads in the absence and presence of 2-APB (100 μm) using the fluorescent dye TMRE. In the absence of 2-APB, TMRE fluorescence stabilized within 2 min after the addition of mitochondria to the medium (Fig. 4a). The subsequent addition of 400 nmol of Ca2+ caused an immediate increase in fluorescence, i.e. decrease in ΔΨ, as expected because of the collapse of ΔΨ during rapid Ca2+ influx. After the ∼100-s period, during which added Ca2+ was accumulated, the TMRE fluorescence decreased but remained much higher than the original fluorescence in the absence of Ca2+. A similar pattern was observed after the second addition of Ca2+. After the third addition, the TMRE fluorescence failed to return toward base line and gradually increased for many minutes thereafter. When 2-APB was added to the mitochondrial suspension (Fig. 4b), TMRE fluorescence increased, indicating some reduction in ΔΨ by this compound. However, unlike what was observed in the absence of 2-APB, the subsequent addition of three pulses of Ca2+ were followed by a return of TMRE fluorescence toward, and eventually to the level maintained before these additions. Thus, at 800 s of incubation, ΔΨ approached complete depolarization in the absence of 2-APB but was at least partially retained in its presence. These observations are consistent with the onset of mCICR in the absence but not in the presence of 2-APB, also observed at ∼800 s of incubation. Although 2-APB by itself causes partial mitochondrial depolarization, this effect was not strong enough to impair net ΔΨ-dependent Ca2+ uptake. It must be emphasized that because of the Nernst equation, data from potentiometric dyes follow a logarithmic, not linear relationship (42Dykens J.A. Stout A.K. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 285-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that is intended for demonstration on this experiment is that mitochondria depolarize further upon completion of Ca2+ uptake (Fig. 4a) unless they are pre-treated with 2-APB (Fig. 4b). The onset of depolarization upon high Ca2+ loading (∼700 s) coincides exactly with the onset of Ca2+ release (Fig. 2, curve a). The choice of the membrane potential-sensitive probe was critical. Many of the available probes were tested (safranin O, tetramethylrhodamine methylester perchlorate (TMRM), rhodamine 123, JC-1), but they all exhibited serious drawbacks due to the necessity of high calcium loading; i.e. safranin O reduced maximal calcium uptake capacity considerably, as has also been found by other laboratories (43Valle V.G. Pereira-da-Silva L. Vercesi A.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), TMRM and rhodamine 123 were very strong respiratory inhibitors and uncouplers even at low concentrations (20 nm, not shown), affecting respiration more than TMRE although the opposite has been observed for rat heart mitochondria (44Scaduto Jr., R.C. Grotyohann L.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), and JC-1 gave an unsatisfactory signal-to-noise ratio but no suppression of respiratory control (not shown). Inhibition of Ca2+-induced Mitochondrial Cytochrome c and Pyridine Nucleotide Release by 2-APB—Release of the mitochondrial intermembrane protein cytochrome c typically accompanies the osmotic swelling and rupture of the outer membrane evoked by activation of the PTP (45Crompton M. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 46Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J.

Antonsson B. Saks V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Loss of mitochondrial matrix pyridine nucleotides is another measure of the PTP, distinguishing it from a mechanism of depolarization mediated by activation of a “low conductance” pore (48Kushnareva Y.E. Sokolove P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 provides the results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay determinations of cytochrome c released into the medium after the addition of Ca2+ and a comparison of the effectiveness of 2-APB and cyclosporin A at inhibiting this release. In the absence of added Ca2+, less than 10% of total mitochondrial cytochrome c was lost to the suspending medium after 1800 s of incubation. After the addition of 2400 nmol of Ca2+ mg–1 protein, ∼58% of total cytochrome c was released at 1800 s. No net release was observed at 700 s, immediately before net Ca2+ release was observed (Fig. 3). 2-APB but not cyclosporin A inhibited Ca2+-induced cytochrome c release, consistent with the differences in the effects of these drugs observed on mCICR. The same pattern was observed for release of matrix pyridine nucleotides (Fig. 6). The appearance of pyridine nucleotides in the medium over that observed in the absence of Ca2+ occurred after the onset of mCICR and was inhibited by 2-APB but not cyclosporin A.Fig. 6NAD + NADH release (% of the total) estimated as described under “Experimental Procedures” from mitochondria incubated in the presence or absence of 2-APB or cyclosporin A and challenged by high calcium loading. –CaCl 2: no calcium added; +CaCl 2 700 s:,400 nmol of CaCl2 was added at 350, 500, and 600 s, and the sample was collected at 700 s; +CaCl 2 1800 s, 400 nmol of CaCl2 was added at 350, 500, and 600 s, and the sample was collected at 1800 s; +CaCl 2 + 2-APB 1800 s, 100 μm 2-APB was added at 50 s, 400 nmol of CaCl2 was added at 350, 500, and 600 s, and the sample was collected at 1800 s; +CaCl 2 + Cys A 1800 s, 2 μm cyclosporin A (Cys A) was added at 50 s, 400 nmol of CaCl2 was added at 350, 500, and 600 s, and the sample was collected at 1800 s.

A link to the occurrence of a certain disease has been established for some of triplet repeats. The CCG, CTG, CAG, and GAA repeats are linked to fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, and Friedreich ataxia, respectively (1Pieretti M. Zhang F. Fu Y.H. Warren S.T.

It is suggested that these repeats have unusual structures and that the unusual structures cause the extraordinary expansion of the repeats related to the occurrence of the diseases (5Catasti P.

The GGA repeat has been identified in portions of human and mouse cellular DNA that cross-hybridize with the internal direct repeat (IR3) repetitive region of Epstein-Barr virus (8Heller M.

The GGA repeat is frequently located within gene regulatory regions and recombination hot spot sites (13Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F.

Thus, the biological significance of the GGA repeat is widely recognized, although the link to a certain disease has not yet been clarified. The GGA repeat is capable of forming variable structures (14Huertas D. Azorin F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13125-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Mishima Y. Kaizu H. Kominami R. J.

We determined the structure of d(GGAGGAGGAGGA) (d(GGA)4) composed of four tandem GGA units under physiological conditions (19Matsugami A. Ouhashi K. Kanagawa M. Liu H. Kanagawa S. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). d(GGA)4 folds into an intramolecular quadruplex composed of a G:G:G:G tetrad and a G(:A):G(:A): G(:A):G heptad. Four G-G segments of d(GGA)4 are aligned parallel to each other due to seven successive turns of the main chain at each of the GGA and GAGG segments. This was the first demonstration that DNA can form an intramolecular parallel quadruplex. Later, a similar architecture to that of the intramolecular parallel quadruplex was found for the telomere DNA in the crystalline state (20Parkinson G.N. Lee M.P.H. Neidle S. Nature. 2002; 417: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). We also showed that two quadruplexes of d(GGA)4 form a dimer stabilized through the stacking interaction between the heptads of the two quadruplexes. Our findings as to GGA triplet repeat DNA, together with the crystallographic result for telomere DNA, indicated the possibility of intramolecular higher order packing of quadruplexes for longer DNA with certain repeating units. To address this point and to elucidate the character of naturally occurring GGA repeat DNA, we studied the structure of d(GGAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGAGGA) (d(GGA)8) under physiological conditions. Here, we present its unique structure. This is the first demonstration of higher order packing of quadruplexes at atomic resolution. The biological events related to GGA triplet repeat DNA can be rationalized in the light of the elucidated structure. Furthermore, our findings provide a support for the hypothetical higher order packing of quadruplexes of telomere DNA and indicate the mode of packing for it. Sample Preparation—d(GGA)8 and mutant oligomers in which each single G residue was replaced by an I residue were prepared as described previously (19Matsugami A. Ouhashi K. Kanagawa M. Liu H. Kanagawa S. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). DNA was dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7) containing 3 mm NaN3 and either 0 or 1–50 mm KCl. The DNA concentrations were 1–40 μm for CD and 0.1–1 mm for NMR. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was used as an internal chemical shift reference. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by gradual cooling to room temperature prior to the measurements. CD and NMR Spectroscopies—CD spectra and thermal CD melting curves were recorded with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. The temperature of the solution was raised from 1 to 95 °C at the rate of 1 °C/min. Changes in CD intensity were monitored at 263 nm. The melting temperature was determined by use of the derivative of the melting curve. NMR spectra were recorded with Bruker DRX600 and DRX800 spectrometers equipped with a quadruple-resonance probe with X, Y, and Z gradients. The following NMR experiments were used to assign the resonances and to obtain distance and dihedral angle constraints; NOESY, 1The abbreviations used are: NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; DQF, double quantum filtered; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectroscopy; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.

Liu H. Kanagawa S. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In total, 750 distance constraints were obtained. Dihedral angle constraints for the β torsion angle were derived from 3 J H5′-P and 3 J H5″-P couplings as described previously (19Matsugami A. Ouhashi K. Kanagawa M. Liu H. Kanagawa S. Uesugi S.

Thus, the β torsion angles of G2, G5, G8, G14, G17, and G20 were constrained to 180 ± 20°. For the other residues, β was left unconstrained. Dihedral angle constraints for the γ torsion angles were derived from 3 J H4′-H5′ and 3 J H4′-H5″ couplings as described previously (19Matsugami A. Ouhashi K. Kanagawa M. Liu H. Kanagawa S. Uesugi S.

Thus, the γ torsion angles of G2, G4, G5, G7, G8, G10, G14, G16, G17, G19, G20, and G22 were constrained to 60 ± 20°. For the other residues, γ was left unconstrained. Dihedral angle constraints for the δ and endocyclic ν0, ν1, ν2, ν3, and ν4 torsion angles were derived from 3 J H1′-H2′, 3 J H2″-H3′, and 3 J H3′-H4′ couplings as described previously (19Matsugami A.

The sugar pucker was determined as follows on the basis of the results of analysis of the intensities of the H1′-H2′, H2″-H3′, and H3′-H4′ cross-peaks in the DQF-COSY spectrum: all G residues, except for G13, and A12, C1′-exo conformation; all A residues except for A12 and A24, C3′-endo conformation; A24, O4′-endo conformation; G13, not determined due to overlapping of resonances. The sugar conformations were confirmed independently by the C3′ and C4′ chemical shift values (23Varani G. Aboul-ela F. Allain F.H.T. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spect. 1996; 29: 51-127Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 24Smith J.S. Nikonowicz E.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5642-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Santos R.A.

The δ and endocyclic ν0–ν4 torsion angles of all G, except for G13, and A12 residues were moderately constrained, leaving the sugar free to take any conformation without an energy penalty between O4′-endo and C2′-endo including C1′-exo in the pseudorotation cycle. In the same way, those of all A residues, except for A12 and A24, were constrained between C2′-exo and C4′-exo, including C3′-endo, and those of A24 between C4′-exo and C1′-exo, including O4′-endo. That of G13 was not constrained. Dihedral angle constraints for the ϵ torsion angle were derived from 3 J H3′-P coupling as described previously (19Matsugami A. Ouhashi K. Kanagawa M. Liu H. Kanagawa S. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 23Varani G. Aboul-ela F. Allain F.H.T. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson.

Thus, the ϵ torsion angles of all residues, except for A24, were constrained to –120 ± 45°. For A24, ϵ was left unconstrained. No dihedral angle constraints were used for the α and ζ torsion angles. Structure Calculation—Structure calculations were carried out using distance and dihedral angle constraints with a simulated annealing protocol supplied with X-PLOR, version 3.8 (27Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). Neither hydrogen bonding constraints nor planarity constraints were included. Twenty final structures were selected from 100 calculations on the basis of the criteria of the smallest residual energy values. None of them violated the distance constraints by more than 0.3 Å or the dihedral angle constraints by more than 6°. The structures were viewed with Insight II (MSI). K+-induced Ordered Structure of d(GGA)8—In the absence of K+, several broad imino proton signals were observed for d(GGA)8 (Fig. 1A). This indicates that although d(GGA)8 seems to form some structure in the absence of K+, it is rather unstable. In contrast, 16 sharp signals appeared in the presence of K+ (Fig. 1B), indicating the formation of a certain stable ordered structure. The chemical shift range of 10.7–11.9 ppm for these signals suggests that the structure formed is a G:G:G:G quartet-based quadruplex. The sharp signals did not appear when Na+ was added instead of K+ (Fig. 1C). Thus, K+ is critically required for the formation of this stable structure. This is notable from a physiological point of view, because the K+ concentration, but not the Na+ one, is high, over 100 mm, in the nucleus. It is known that a parallel quadruplex gives a positive CD band at 260 nm, while an antiparallel one gives a positive CD band at 295 nm either with or without a positive CD band at 260 nm (28Balagurumoorthy P. Brahmachari S.K. Mohanty D. Bansal M. Sasisekharan V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4061-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 29Catasti P. Chen X. Moyzis R.K. Bradbury M. Gupta G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 534-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of d(GGA)8 in the presence of K+ had a positive CD band at around 260 nm without a positive CD band at around 295 nm (Fig. 1D). This suggests that d(GGA)8 forms a parallel quadruplex. The melting temperature of the structure formed by d(GGA)8 in the presence of K+ was determined to be rather high, 86 °C. This again suggests the formation of a quadruplex, because the melting temperature of a quadruplex is generally very high. It was also found that the melting temperature does not depend on the concentration of d(GGA)8. This indicates that the structure formed is unimolecular. This conclusion was supported by the result of analysis of the line widths of NMR resonances that are sensitive to molecular weight. The line widths for d(GGA)8 (24-mer) were the same as those for d(GGA)4 (12-mer), which exists as a dimer in solution (19Matsugami A. Ouhashi K. Kanagawa M. Liu H. Kanagawa S. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Resonance Assignments—The non-exchangeable 1H, 13C, and 31P resonances of d(GGA)8 were assigned as described previously (19Matsugami A. Ouhashi K. Kanagawa M. Liu H. Kanagawa S. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) using standard methods (23Varani G. Aboul-ela F. Allain F.H.T. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson.

As an example, Fig. 2A shows expansion of the NOESY spectrum allowing the sequential assignments of H1′ and H6/H8 through H1′(i – 1)-H6/H8(i)-H1′(i) connectivities. H2′, H2″, H3′, H4′, and H5′/H5″ resonances were assigned by means of TOCSY and DQF-COSY spectra. These assignments were confirmed by the sequential H3′(i – 1)-P(i)-H4′/H5′/H5″(i) connectivities in the 1H-31P HetCor spectrum, the assignments of 31P resonances being made at the same time (data not shown). The chemical shifts of 13C resonances were obtained from the 1H-13C HSQC spectrum. Exchangeable 1H resonances were assigned as described previously with the use of mutant oligomers in which each single G residue was replaced by an I residue (19Matsugami A. Ouhashi K. Kanagawa M. Liu H. Kanagawa S. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Formation of Two G:G:G:G Tetrads and Two G(:A):G(:A): G(:A):G Heptads and Their Mutual Arrangement—The formation of the G2:G5:G8:G11 and G14:G17:G20:G23 tetrads was concluded on the basis of GNH/NH2-GH8 (Fig. 2B) and GNH-GNH NOEs; the NOEs commonly observed for both tetrads are shown in Fig. 3A. The formation of the G1(:A3):G4(:A6): G7(:A9):G10 and G13(:A15):G16(:A18):G19(:A21):G22 heptads was concluded on the basis of GNH/NH2-AH8 (Fig. 2B), ANH2-GH1′ (Fig. 2C), GNH2-ANH2, and GH8-AH8 NOEs, in addition to GNH/NH2-GH8 and GNH-GNH ones; the NOEs commonly observed for both heptads are shown in Fig. 3B. A12 and A24 are not involved in either the tetrads or the heptads. The arrangement of two heptads was determined on the basis of the strong AH2-AH1′/2′/2″ NOEs between A3 and A21, A6 and A18, and A9 and A15, and the medium to weak GH8-GH1′ ones between G1 and G22, G4 and G19, G7 and G16, and G10 and G13 (Fig. 2A). Thus, the overall structure of d(GGA)8 was concluded to be as shown in Fig. 3C. Structure of d(GGA) 8 —The applied constraints and the structural statistics for the 20 final structures are summarized in Table I.

A representative structure with the lowest energy is shown in Fig. 4B, a trace of the sugar-phosphate main chain being indicated by a tube for clarity. Two tetrad and two heptads can be seen (Fig. 4, C–E), as already discussed qualitatively. A12 is located close to the upper heptad, although it is not involved in the heptad. A24 is stacked on G23. A turn at a G1-G2-A3 trinucleotide segment, which is composed of a sheared G1:A3 base pair and a single G2 residue at the top, is followed by another turn at a G2-A3-G4-G5 segment (Fig. 4B). A further succession of turns is found for each GGA and GAGG segment except for the G11-A12-G13-G14 and G22-G23-A24 segments. In the cases of the canonical B- and A- forms, the backbone dihedral angles are as follows; α(g–), β(t), γ(g+), ϵ(t), and ζ(g–) (31Saenger W. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1983Google Scholar). Deviation from the canonical dihedral angles of α, β, and γ was found for all A residues. Deviation of α and β was found for G4, G7, G10, G11, G16, G19, and G22. Deviation of ζ was found for almost all G residues. The combination of these deviated dihedral angles results in the successive turns of the backbone. These successive turns cause the four G-G segments, i.e. the G1-G2, G4-G5, G7-G8, and G10-G11 segments, to be aligned parallel to each other. As a result, the G1–G11 portion of d(GGA)8 forms an intramolecular parallel quadruplex (Figs. 3C and 4B). Similarly, the G13-G14, G16-G17, G19-G20, and G22-G23 segments are aligned parallel to each other, and the G13–G23 portion forms another intramolecular parallel quadruplex. The two quadruplexes are packed in a tail-to-tail manner through stacking between the two heptad planes, the orientation of G-G segments of one quadruplex being opposite to that of the other quadruplex (Figs. 3C and 4B). The stacking between the tetrad and heptad planes is shown in Fig. 4, C and D. The five-membered ring of one guanine base is stacked on the six-membered ring of the other guanine base for each G-G segment. The A3, A6, A9, A15, A18, and A21 bases are stacked on the G2, G5, G8, G14, G17, and G20 sugars, respectively, which is characteristic of the structure of a GNA trinucleotide loop and consistent with the extreme upfield shift of H4′ (2.62–2.84 ppm) and the moderate upfield shift of H3′ (4.56–4.66 ppm) of these G residues (32Li Y. Zon G. Wilson W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 33Hirao I. Kawai G. Yoshizawa S. Nishimura Y. Ishido Y. Watanabe K. Miura K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Stacking of the two heptads is shown in Fig. 4E. The G1, A3, G4, A6, G7, A9, and G10 bases are stacked on the G22, A21, G19, A18, G16, A15, and G13 ones, respectively. All G residues take on the anti conformation with respect to the glycoside bond, while all A residues, except for A12 and A24, take on the high anti-conformation. All G residues take on the B-form sugar conformation (around C1′-exo), while all A residues, except for A12 and A24, take on the A-form sugar conformation (around C3′-endo). The high anti and C3′-endo conformations of the six A residues are supposed to be preferable for the series of turns and/or for good stacking interactions. Weak to medium NOEs were observed between A6H2 and G7H8, A9H2 and G10H8, A18H2 and G19H8, and A21H2 and G22H8. These NOEs could be very strong, if A6, A9, A18, and A21 take on the syn conformation, forming hydrogen bonds, i.e. G4NH2-A6N1 and G4N3-A6NH2, G7NH2-A9N1 and G7N3-A9NH2, G16NH2-A18N1 and G16N3-A18NH2, and G19NH2-A21N1 and G19N3-A21NH2, respectively. Therefore, there is the possibility that there is a small fraction of the syn conformation for A6, A9, A18, and A21, being in fast exchange with the major high anti conformation on an NMR time scale. Comparison of the Structures of d(GGA) 8 and d(GGA) 4 —The structures of d(GGA)8 and d(GGA)4 are shown schematically in Fig. 5, A and B. d(GGA)8 forms a monomeric structure, while d(GGA)4 forms a dimeric one. The structure of the G1-G11 portion of d(GGA)8 is similar to that of the upper monomer of d(GGA)4. A12 of d(GGA)8 folds back and is located close to the upper heptad, while that of d(GGA)4 is stacked on G11 and moves away from the center. The main chain of d(GGA)8 goes down further through A12, and G13 is involved in the lower heptad. The structure of the G13-A24 portion of d(GGA)8 is similar to that of the lower monomer of d(GGA)4. As a whole, the monomeric architecture of d(GGA)8 resembles the dimeric architecture of d(GGA)4. From the viewpoint of symmetry, the formation of an octad composed of four G and four A bases may seem to be natural. A12 of d(GGA)4 (12-mer) does not fold back to the heptad plane, and thus the octad is not formed (Fig. 5B). This was explained by that the terminal A12 of d(GGA)4 does not have a following G residue that would pull it to the heptad plane (19Matsugami A. Ouhashi K. Kanagawa M. Liu H. Kanagawa S. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the case of d(GGA)8 (24-mer) (Fig. 5A), it is conceivable that A12 may associate with the upper heptad, resulting in the formation of an octad. However, all NMR data for d(GGA)8 were against the existence of the sheared G10:A12 base pair that is needed for the formation of an octad, although the position of A12 was determined to be close to the upper heptad (Fig. 4B). A12 must bridge the upper and lower quadruplexes. It seems that A12 cannot be involved in the octad to play this role due to structural restriction. The terminal A24 does not fold back to the heptad, either, for the same reason as for d(GGA)4. Thus, an octad is not formed for d(GGA)8 either. From the viewpoint of achieving maximum stacking interactions, the relative arrangement of the two heptads of d(GGA)8 can be rationalized. For example, if the lower heptad is rotated by either 90° or 180°, one A base of each heptad cannot be involved in the stacking interaction, which is energetically less stable and thus unfavorable. Each monomer of d(GGA)4 forms an intramolecular parallel quadruplex (Fig. 5B). Matsugami et al. (19Matsugami A. Ouhashi K. Kanagawa M. Liu H. Kanagawa S. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) first demonstrated that DNA can form the intramolecular parallel quadruplex. Later, an intramolecular parallel quadruplex was found for a telomere DNA in the crystalline state (20Parkinson G.N. Lee M.P.H. Neidle S. Nature. 2002; 417: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). These structures have indicated the intramolecular higher order packing of quadruplexes. In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time that the intramolecular higher order packing of quadruplexes actually occurs and the mode of the packing at atomic resolution is discussed. The intramolecular packing of the two quadruplexes for d(GGA)8 is achieved through the stacking interaction between the heptads of each quadruplex (Fig. 5A). As a result, the two quadruplexes are arranged in a tail-to-tail manner. Alternatively, if the G13(:A15):G16(:A18):G19(:A21): G22 heptad is stacked on the G2:G5:G8:G11 tetrad, with A12 bulging out, then the two quadruplexes are arranged in a head-to-tail manner. However, this does not occur for d(GGA)8, because heptad-heptad stacking in a tail-to-tail manner is energetically much more stable and favorable than heptad-tetrad stacking in a head-to-tail manner. When the GGA unit is further repeated, formation of the structure shown in Fig. 5A is expected for the other 24-mer region, too. The structures formed for each 24-mer region may further pack through the stacking interaction between the tetrads of each structure. The GGA triplet repeat is abundant in eukaryotic genomes (7Beckmann J.S. Weber J.L. Genomics. 1992; 12: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and is frequently located within biologically important regions such as gene regulatory regions and recombination hot spot sites (11Derry J.M. Wiedemann P. Blair P. Wang Y. Kerns J.A. Lamahieu V. Godfrey V.L. Wilkinson J.E. Francke U. Genomics. 1995; 29: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Hirsch M.R. Gaugler L.

FASEB J. 1998; 2: 2939-2949Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Thus, the biological significance of the GGA repeat is widely recognized. The GGA repeat shows considerable genetic polymorphism due to genetic instability (7Beckmann J.S. Weber J.L. Genomics. 1992; 12: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 34Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D. Trout A. Kedes L.H. Cohen S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3632-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This genetic instability is supposed to originate from DNA slippage during DNA replication and/or frequent recombination of the repeats (35Hearne C.M. Ghosh S. Todd J.A. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 288-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The structure elucidated in this study can be used to rationalize the occurrence of these events. In the course of replication, double-stranded DNA is locally melted to yield single-stranded DNA for use as a template for DNA synthesis. In this case, the GGA strand is expected to form the unique intramolecular structure we found, when the high concentration of K+, over 100 mm, in the nucleus is considered. The structure is very stable, as revealed by its high melting temperature of 86 °C. It was also found for d(GGA)4 that once the unique structure is formed, the addition of the complementary strand, d(TCC)4, is not effective for the formation of a duplex (19Matsugami A. Ouhashi K. Kanagawa M. Liu H. Kanagawa S. Uesugi S. Katahira M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The unique structure remained even in the presence of the complementary strand. The formed structure could cause the slippage during DNA replication, which results in a gain or loss of repeats and thus genetic instability. Alternatively, intermolecular association of two double-stranded DNAs through the packing of two quadruplexes formed in each DNA, as shown in Fig. 5B, may also occur and facilitate the recombination. This idea is coincident with the fact that the GGA repeat is frequently located in recombination hot spot sites. The facilitated recombination may also be responsible for the genetic instability of the GGA repeat. Furthermore, the intermolecular association at the GGA repeat may play a role in the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The idea of pairing through a quadruplex has already been proposed for the G stretch (37Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar, 38Subdquist W.I. Klug A. Nature. 1989; 342: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 39Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 40Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar). It is known that the synapsis formation between homologous chromosomes in meiosis usually begins at telomere DNA, but that it sometimes starts at loci inside a chromosome. It is expected that the unique intramolecular structure shown in Fig. 5A is formed in the course of transcription as well, because DNA is locally melted in this case, too. The formed structure is supposed to be an obstacle for an RNA polymerase to proceed, which could explain the attenuation of gene expression at the transcription level (10Aoki T. Koch K.S. Leffert H.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have revealed that RNA with the related sequence also can form a similar intramolecular parallel quadruplex (36Liu H. Matsugami A. Katahira M. Uesugi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 955-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This RNA structure is very stable, too, the melting temperature being 86 °C (36Liu H. Matsugami A. Katahira M. Uesugi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 955-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is expected that the unique structure in the transcribed mRNA becomes an obstacle for the translation machinery to associate with and/or proceed along mRNA in the course of translation, which may lead to the attenuation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (10Aoki T. Koch K.S. Leffert H.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The structure elucidated in this study can also provide a clue as to the higher order packing of the telomere DNA. A quadruplex of telomere DNA only contains the tetrad, not the heptad (Fig. 5C). Therefore, the arrangement of the two quadruplexes in a head-to-tail manner, in which the G26:G32:G38: G44 tetrad of the second quadruplex is stacked on the G4:G10: G16:G22 tetrad of the first quadruplex, with a T23-T24-A25 segment serving as a linker, seems to be likely for d[AGGG-(TTAGGG)7], as proposed by Parkinson et al. (20Parkinson G.N. Lee M.P.H. Neidle S. Nature. 2002; 417: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of the heptad, the tail-to-tail arrangement of the two quadruplexes, in which the G26:G32:G38:G44 tetrad is stacked on the G2:G8:G14:G20 tetrad, with folding back of the T23-T24-A25 segment, seems less likely, although it is not impossible."
https://openalex.org/W2046684152,"Recently, six genes of the gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis gene cluster in Gibberella fujikuroi were cloned and the functions of five of these genes were determined. Here we describe the function of the sixth gene, P450-3, and the cloning and functional analysis of a seventh gene, orf3, located at the left border of the gene cluster. We have thereby defined the complete GA biosynthesis gene cluster in this fungus. The predicted amino acid sequence of orf3 revealed no close homology to known proteins. High performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of the culture fluid of knock-out mutants identified GA1 and GA4, rather than GA3 and GA7, as the major C19-GA products, suggesting that orf3 encodes the GA4 1,2-desaturase. This was confirmed by transformation of the SG139 mutant, which lacks the GA biosynthesis gene cluster, with the desaturase gene renamed des. The transformants converted GA4 to GA7, and also metabolized GA9 (3-deoxyGA4) to GA120 (1,2-didehydroGA9), but the 2alpha-hydroxylated compound GA40 was the major product in this case. We demonstrate also by gene disruption that P450-3, one of the four cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes in the GA gene cluster, encodes the 13-hydroxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of GA7 to GA3, in the last step of the pathway. This enzyme also catalyzes the 13-hydroxylation of GA4 to GA1. Disruption of the des gene in an UV-induced P450-3 mutant produced a double mutant lacking both desaturase and 13-hydroxylase activities that accumulated high amounts of the commercially important GA4. The des and P450-3 genes differ in their regulation by nitrogen metabolite repression. In common with the other five GA biosynthesis genes, expression of the desaturase gene is repressed by high amounts of nitrogen in the culture medium, whereas P450-3 is the only gene in the cluster not repressed by nitrogen."
https://openalex.org/W2078776671,"RhoA, -B, and -C are ADP-ribosylated by Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 to induce redistribution of the actin filaments in intact cells, a finding that has led to the notion that the ADP-ribosylation blocks coupling of Rho to the downstream effectors.

ADP-ribosylated Rho is even capable of activating the effector protein ROK in a recombinant system.

The modified complex turned out to be resistant to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate- and GTPγS-induced release of Rho from GDI-1. Thus, ADP-ribosylation leads to entrapment of Rho in the GDI-1 complex.

The Rho subfamily of low molecular mass GTPases comprises RhoA/B/C, Rac1/2/3, Cdc42, RhoD, RhoE/Rnd, RhoG, TC10, and TTF. The best characterized of them, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, have been shown to be master regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas Rho is involved in the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers, Rac participates in the control of lamellipodia and Cdc42 in the formation of filopodia. In addition to their function as regulators of the microfilament system, the Rho proteins are involved in the management of several cellular functions such as membrane trafficking, smooth muscle contraction, phospholipid metabolism, cell cycle progression, cell transformation, apoptosis, and transcriptional activation (1Hall A.

In the GTP-bound form, Rho translocates to plasma membranes where it interacts with effectors to transduce the signal downstream. In the inactive GDP-bound form, Rho is complexed by the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), 1The abbreviations use are: GDI-1, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); C21, Rho binding domain of rhotekin; C3, the chimeric C2IN-C3 transferase; RBD, Rho binding domain; ROK, rhokinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; CNF, cytotoxic necrotizing factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor. thereby localizing it to the cytosolic fraction. Three isoforms of GDI have been described: Rho-GDI-1 that interacts with Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 and the D4-GDI or Ly-GDI that is selectively expressed in hematopoetic cell lines (3Fukumoto Y.

It is poorly understood how Rho is released from the GDI complex. Phospholipids, especially PIP2, are reported to liberate Rho from the GDI complex (8Bourmeyster N. Stasia M.-J. Garin J. Gagnon J.

Recently, moesin, a member of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) family, that binds to CD44 or intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) has been reported to bind GDI thereby releasing monomeric Rho (10Takaishi K.

Because Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 turns off the Rho-dependent signal pathway by selective ADP-ribosylation of RhoA, -B, and -C but not of other low molecular mass GTPases, C3 has been classified as an indispensable tool in cell biology. The disadvantage of poor cell accessibility because of failure of receptor binding and translocation domain has been overcome by different approaches: 1) microinjection of C3 (14Nobes C.D. Hall A. Aktories K. Bacterial Toxins: Tools in Cell Biology and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim1997: 71-83Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar); 2) electroporation of cells in the presence of C3 (15Stasia M.-J. Jouan A. Bourmeyster N. Boquet P. Vignais P.V. Biochem.

In intact cells, ADP-ribosylation of Rho is accompanied by disaggregation of actin filaments leading to the notion that ADP-ribosylation turns Rho inactive. It has been reported that the typical feature of the disrupted actin filament system caused by C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation is reversed by the cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF) (22Barth H.

Fabbri A. Paradisi S. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3936-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is known to transform Rho constitutively active by deamidation of glutamine 63 (25Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 26Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Because deamidation merely blocks GTP hydrolysis, ADP-ribosylated Rho is able to interact functionally with its effectors. Thus, inhibition of Rho-effector coupling seems not to be the mode of how ADP-ribosylation inactivates Rho functions. Therefore, we studied the influence of ADP-ribosylation on the Rho-GDI interaction and on the subcellular distribution of Rho and report here that ADP-ribosylation prevents membrane binding and traps Rho in the GDI complex thereby blocking Rho cycling between cytosol and membranes. Materials—[32P]NAD was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and GTPγS were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The antibody against RhoA and GDI-1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Recombinant Proteins—RhoA was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus expression system (Pharmingen). Sf9 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured at 25 °C in TNM-FH insect medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Infected with pAcGHLT containing RhoA baculovirus transfer vectors (multiplicity of infection of 5–10) was performed at 25 °C for 48 h. Thereafter, the cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h. GST-RhoA from the supernatant was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30 min followed by intensive washing with buffer A to remove unbound proteins. RhoA was released from the parent GST fusion proteins by incubation with thrombin (Pharmingen, 10 units) at 4 °C overnight in buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The beads were removed by centrifugation, and thrombin was precipitated using p-aminobenzamidine beads. The homogeneity of the recombinant RhoA was proven by SDS-PAGE. GDI-1 was purified as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins from Escherichia coli followed by thrombin cleavage (100 μg/ml for 30 min at 22 °C). Thrombin was removed by precipitation with benzamidine-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The chimeric C2IN-C3 toxin (exoenzyme C3 is fused to the catalytically deficient C2I toxin) (23Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and C. botulinum C2 toxin were purified as described (27Ohishi I. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study C3 is synonymous with C2IN-C3. Toxin Treatment—NIH3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μm streptomycin. Fibroblasts on 10-cm dishes were treated with C2IN-C3 fusion toxin or C2 toxin (C2I plus C2II) (each 1 μg/ml) for 3 h. The medium was removed and the cells were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 300 μl/dish lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 80 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA). The cells were disrupted mechanically by sonication (five times on ice), followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 2000 × g to remove the nuclear fraction. The supernatant was used as cell lysate. Lysates from NIH3T3 cells were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to prepare cytosolic and total particulate fractions. The high speed pellet, which consists of the heavy and the light membrane fractions, was washed and resuspended in lysis buffer (28Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33067-33073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cytosolic and membranous fractions were brought to the same concentration of protein measured by the method of Bradford (51Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation—RhoA (50 μg/ml) was subjected to ADP-ribosylation by C3 exoenzyme (1 μg/ml) and 10 μm [32P]NAD for 30 min at 37 °C. Nucleotide exchange reaction: isoprenylated RhoA (200 μg/ml) dissolved in lysis buffer was incubated in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS or 100 μm GDP for 1 h on ice. Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 12.5% acrylamide gels. The gels were analyzed by PhosphorImager SI from Molecular Dynamics. Proteins were separated on 12.5% acrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose for 2 h at 250 mA. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk. Blots were incubated for 2 h with anti-RhoA monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-GDI-1 polyclonal antibody (both diluted 1:2.000) and anti-PLD1 (1:500) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween and then for 45 min with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Western blotting of purified recombinant proteins confirmed that the antibodies were specific (results not shown). Binding of RhoA to Membranes—Recombinant RhoA from Sf9 cells was ADP-ribosylated as described above followed by pre-binding of GDP or GTPγS. RhoA (2 μg) was incubated with NIH3T3 membranes (50 μg) on ice for 30 min. The reaction mixture was layered onto 200 μl of sucrose (20% (w/v) sucrose supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) using microcentrifugation tips and centrifuged for 1 h at 30,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was precipitated and resolved in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The pellet was dissolved in the same volume of sample buffer. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed for RhoA content by immunoblot. Separation of RhoA from the GDI Complex—Cytosol was prepared as described above. 1 mg of protein dissolved in 500 μl of separation buffer was loaded onto a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with separation buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 6.8, 400 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose). The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min, and the fraction size was 500 μl. The fractions were precipitated with chloroform/methanol and resolved in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer. Fractions were analyzed by immunoblot for RhoA and GDI-1. Calibration of the column was performed with bovine serum albumin (66 kDa, fractions 4 and 5), chicken albumin (45 kDa, fractions 7 and 8), and chymotrypsin (25 kDa, fractions 11 and 12). Cytosols (0.5 mg/ml) prepared in lysis buffer supplemented with 250 mm sucrose were incubated in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml PIP2 or buffer at 37 °C for 10 min and applied to a 30-kDa cut-off membrane (Microcon 30, Amicon, Beverly) at 7000 × g for 30 min at room temperature. Supernatant and filtrate were brought to the same protein concentration followed by immunoblot analysis for RhoA and GDI-1. Pull-down Experiments with GST-C21—Pull-down experiments were performed as described by Reid et al. (29Reid T. Furayashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Ice-cold lysis buffer (500 μl; 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to cell lysates containing 1 mg of protein in total. For recombinant assay, 1 μg of GDP- or GTPγS-loaded RhoA was added to 500 μl of lysis buffer. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was used for pull-down assay. To this end, 20 μl of beads slurry of the Rho binding domain GST-C21 from rhotekin bearing ∼30 μg of fusion protein were added to each sample and rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm and washed twice with lysis buffer. To each sample 20 μl of Laemmli buffer were added to the beads, and 12% SDS-PAGE with subsequent transfer of proteins onto nitrocellulose was performed. RhoA was detected by Western blot using specific antibody. Activation of ROK by ADP-ribosylated RhoA—The consequences of ADP-ribosylation on the Rho-dependent activation of the effector protein ROK were tested in a recombinant system. The activity of ROK was determined in terms of phosphorylation of the myosin binding subunit in the presence or absence of isoprenylated RhoA. As shown in Fig. 1, unmodified RhoA-GTPγS as well as ADP-ribosylated RhoA-GTPγS stimulated ROK activity, the latter to a lesser extent. Thus, ADP-ribosylation does not interfere with Rho-dependent ROK activation per se. Subcellular Distribution of RhoA in C3-treated NIH3T3 Fibroblasts—In terms of the cytosol membrane model of the Rho-GTPase cycle, active Rho is translocated to the membranes where effector proteins are also present (30Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To study whether ADP-ribosylated Rho does in fact bind to membranes, the subcellular distribution of Rho after treatment of NIH3T3 cells with the chimeric C3 toxin was determined (Fig. 2A). When cytosolic and membrane fractions of control NIH3T3 cells were adjusted to the same protein concentration, about one-half of the cellular Rho was localized in the cytosolic fraction and the other half in the membranes. ADP-ribosylation, however, resulted in a complete shift to the cytosol, and no Rho was detected anywhere in the membrane fractions (Fig. 2A). To exclude that the observed translocation of Rho was based on the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, that is the consequence of ADP-ribosylation of Rho, the actin filaments were depolymerized by C. botulinum C2 toxin, that directly ADP-ribosylates actin thereby rendering it incapable of polymerization (31Aktories K. Sehr P. Just I. Aktories K. Bacterial Toxins: Tools in Cell Biology and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim1997: 93-101Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 32Boquet P. Munro P. Fiorentini C. Just I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Rho from these cells showed almost the same subcellular distribution as control cells (Fig. 2A). Thus, ADP-ribosylation rendered Rho incapable of binding to the membranes and led to its accumulation in the cytosol. The total localization of the Rho regulatory protein GDI-1 in the cytosol was altered neither by C3 nor by C2 toxin (Fig. 2A). Rho Activity State—To check the activity state of Rho within the C3-treated cell, the amount of active ADP-ribosylated Rho was determined by pull-down experiments using the Rho binding domain of rhotekin (C21) (29Reid T. Furayashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). To exclude that ADP-ribosylation hampers the Rho-C21 interaction, this experiment was first carried out with recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig. 2B, recombinant GTPγS-bound RhoA was pulled down with GST-C21 independently of the ADP-ribosylation. Subsequently, Rho from lysates of C3-intoxicated cells was subjected to the pull-down assay with C21. As expected, some active Rho was present in fetal calf serum-cultured control cells, whereas Rho from C3-treated cells was completely inactive (Fig. 2B). Binding of ADP-ribosylated RhoA to GDI-1—Because cellular ADP-ribosylated Rho was completely cytosolic, we addressed the question whether the modified Rho was monomeric or complexed with GDI-1 (33Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 34Regazzi R. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17512-17519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To separate monomeric RhoA from the Rho-GDI complex, cytosolic fractions were passed through an ultra-centrifugation membrane with a 30-kDa cut off. As shown in Fig. 3A, both RhoA (molecular mass ∼ 20 kDa) and GDI-1 (molecular mass ∼ 24 kDa) were detected in the supernatant but not in the filtrate suggesting that RhoA was completely complexed with GDI-1 (molecular mass of about 45 kDa). Addition of PIP2 to control cytosol led to the detection of RhoA and GDI-1 in the filtrate (Fig. 3A), indicating that PIP2 indeed released RhoA from the complex and induced the formation of monomeric RhoA in the cytosol. However, the ADP-ribosylated Rho-GDI complex in the cytosol persisted in the presence of PIP2 (Fig. 3A). To directly prove the presence of the Rho-GDI complex in the supernatant, gel permeation chromatography of cytosolic fractions prepared from control and from C3-treated cells was performed. RhoA from control cytosol eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 40–50 kDa and a minority with 20–30 kDa (Fig. 3B). RhoA from C3-treated cells eluted completely at 40–50 kDa indicating that ADP-ribosylated RhoA was complexed with GDI-1 or other proteins but was not monomeric. Binding of ADP-ribosylated Rho to GDI-1 was also tested in a recombinant system by nucleotide-dependent co-precipitation of Rho with GST-GDI-1 immobilized to Sepharose. As shown in Fig. 3C, unmodified as well as modified RhoA bound to GDI-1 when loaded with GDP but only faintly when bound to GTPγS. The faint binding of GTPγS-loaded Rho reflects a low affinity binding of RhoA-GTPγS to GDI-1. ADP-ribosylated Rho bound to GDI-1 with higher affinity in comparison to non-modified Rho (Fig. 3C). A further indication for higher affinity came from a precipitation experiment of RhoA from cytosolic fractions using immobilized GST-GDI-1. Added GST-GDI-1 competed with endogenous GDI-1 for RhoA binding by complete precipitation of cytosolic Rho. However, GST-GDI-1 was incapable of precipitating modified RhoA from cytosols prepared from C3-treated cells (data not shown). Thus, the ADP-ribosylated RhoA-GDI-1 complex seemed to be more stable than the complex with non-modified Rho. Activitation of ADP-ribosylated Rho from Lysates—To confirm that the increased stability of the ADP-ribosylated Rho-GDI complex in fact hampers Rho activation, lysates were treated with and without C3 and NAD followed by GTPγS incubation. Active Rho was determined by rhotekin pull-down. In contrast to the condition in Fig. 2B, the pull-down was carried out in the absence of any detergents. The reason for the latter condition is not to disturb the stability of the Rho-GDI complex. As shown in Fig. 4, unmodified Rho-GTPγS was active whereas Rho from C3-treated lysates turned out to be inactive. This finding underlines that GTPγS was capable of releasing unmodified Rho but not ADP-ribosylated Rho from the GDI complex. As a control the sequence of reaction was reversed: lysates were pretreated with GTPγS followed by ADP-ribosylation. This sequence of reaction guaranteed the presence of monomeric Rho and GDI-1. Monomeric Rho-GTPγS was then ADP-ribosylated and pulled down by rhotekin (Fig. 4). Thus, entrapment of ADP-ribosylated Rho in the GDI complex effectively prevented Rho activation by GTPγS. Because of the widespread application of C3 as a tool in cell biology, the knowledge of the cellular mode of action is essential for the understanding of C3 effects on signal transduction. However, it is still unclear how ADP-ribosylation causes inactivation of the Rho GTPases. Studies on the functional consequences of ADP-ribosylation on the GTPase cycle of Rho do not reveal remarkable changes in nucleotide binding (35Hancock J.F. Hall A.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ADP-ribosylated Rho is still capable of binding to effector proteins: nucleotide independently to the lipid kinases phospholipase D1 (38Genth H. Schmidt M. Gerhard R. Aktories K. Just I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (39Ren X.-D. Bokoch G.M. Traynor-Kaplan A. Jenkins G.H. Anderson R.A. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) but nucleotide dependently to rhotekin (38Genth H. Schmidt M. Gerhard R. Aktories K. Just I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), Rho kinase (38Genth H. Schmidt M. Gerhard R. Aktories K. Just I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5296-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation is thought to inactivate the cellular functions of Rho by blocking Rho-effector coupling, the crucial step in downstream signaling (40Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Aktories K. Koch G. Aktories K. Bacterial Toxins: Tools in Cell Biology and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim1997: 61-69Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 42Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). ROK belongs to a class of Rho effector proteins that are characterized by an autoinhibitory intramolecular interaction released by binding to RhoA (43Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar, 44Amano M. Fukata J. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This regulatory concept is based on the findings that the Rho binding domain (RBD)-deficient ROK is constitutively active and that an antibody toward the RBD of ROK is sufficient for activating ROK, thus mimicking Rho (44Amano M. Fukata J. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Based on the latter finding, mere binding of ADP-ribosylated RhoA should be sufficient for ROK activation as presented above in a recombinant system. However, direct inhibition of Rho-effector coupling is obviously not the mode of action for how Rho is inactivated by ADP-ribosylation in intact cells. The notion that ADP-ribosylated Rho is biologically active is further supported by the observation that sequential treatment of cells with C3 followed by CNF1 results in typical features of the CNF1 morphology (22Barth H. Olenik C. Sehr P. Schmidt G. Aktories K. Meyer D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27407-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Matarrese P. Fabbri A. Paradisi S. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3936-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylated RhoAQ63E, likely loaded with cellular GTP, is obviously active, i.e. capable of downstream signaling. The ADP-ribose appears to be inert. The prominent finding after treatment of cells with C3 was the altered subcellular distribution of Rho, so that ADP-ribosylated cellular Rho was completely localized to the cytosolic fraction. From this finding arises the question whether cytosolic Rho is monomeric or bound to GDI-1. From the gel filtration and the ultrafiltration experiments, it became clear that ADP-ribosylated Rho is bound to GDI. Comparable data, the complexation of ADP-ribosylated Rho with GDI, have been shown in smooth muscle strips using immunoprecipitation techniques (45Fujihara H. Walker L.A. Gong M.C. Lemichez E. Boquet P. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We confirmed this finding directly, by the binding of recombinant ADP-ribosylated RhoA to recombinant GDI-1 thereby excluding the involvement of any additional factors. From the structure of the RhoA-GDI-1 complex can be deduced that the ADP-ribose at Asn-41 is directed to the solvent and may not hamper the formation of the complex (46Longenecker K. Read P. Derewenda U. Dauter Z. Liu X. Garrard S. Walker L. Somlyo A.V. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation, however, changes the binding properties of Rho to GDI-1. PIP2 and GTPγS, which are reported to release Rho from the complex (8Bourmeyster N. Stasia M.-J. Garin J. Gagnon J. Boquet P. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12863-12869Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Chuang T.-H. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), were unable to do so when GDI-1 was complexed with ADP-ribosylated RhoA. Our findings on the stability of the ADP-ribosylated Rho-GDI complex are an indication that the modified complex escapes the release mechanisms. This notion is further supported by the finding that recombinant GDI can compete with cellular GDI for Rho binding but not when cellular GDI is bound to ADP-ribosylated Rho. Thus, modified Rho seems to be trapped in the cytosolic GDI complex thereby escaping the regulatory cycle. It is generally accepted that the activation of Rho is accompanied by a translocation to the membranes and that membrane-bound Rho reflects the active one (47Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). The ERM proteins are considered as displacement factors that release Rho from the GDI complex to allow subsequent interaction with the exchange factors (GEF) (11Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 12Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Hotta I. Takaishi K. Imamura H. Nakano K. Kodama A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3279-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The GEFs are located at the plasma membrane as shown for the Rho-specific Lbc (49Sterpetti P. Hack A.A. Bashar M.P. Park B. Cheng S. Knoll J.H.M. Urano T. Feig L.A. Toksoz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1334-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, ADP-ribosylation inhibits Rho activation by GEFs through prevention of its membrane binding. In a recombinant system, ADP-ribosylation reduced Lbc-catalyzed GTP loading of Rho (22Barth H. Olenik C. Sehr P. Schmidt G. Aktories K. Meyer D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27407-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Both effects together may prevent GTP loading of ADP-ribosylated Rho. This notion is supported by our finding on the absence of any active ADP-ribosylated Rho from C3-treated cells as determined by rhotekin pull-down. In terms of the cytosol-membrane model of Rho GTPase cycle a functional effector protein is characterized by membrane association. Because ADP-ribosylation entraps Rho in the cytosolic GDI complex, ADP-ribosylation indirectly blocks coupling of Rho to a membrane-bound effector protein. This notion meets the former hypothesis of blocked Rho-effector coupling by ADP-ribosylation; however, under special conditions such as the sequential intoxication with C3 and CNF1, ADP-ribosylated RhoAQ63E is likely to escape GDI-dependent inactivation due to the low affinity of modified Rho-GTP to GDI-1 (22Barth H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23959-23963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our current findings we propose a model of how ADP-ribosylation results in inactive Rho: ADP-ribosylated Rho-GDP binds strongly to GDI-1 and is trapped in this complex. The modified complex possesses altered properties so that ADP-ribosylated Rho is not released by activating signal inputs. ADP-ribosylated Rho, incapable of being translocated to the membranes, fails to meet membrane-associated players of the GTPase cycle such as exchange factors and effector proteins. ADP-ribosylation at Asn-41 captures Rho in the inactive form. We thank Jürgen Dumbach for expert technical assistance."

Transcription of the dinG::galK fusion was suppressed by overexpression of the LexA protein, suggesting the SOS nature of the induction (1Lewis L.K. Jenkins M.E. Mount D.W. J.

Indeed, sequencing of the dinG promoter revealed an asymmetric nucleotide sequence TTG(N10)CAG that was similar but not identical to the canonical, fully symmetrical CTG(N10)CAG SOS box. Despite the deviation of the SOS box found in the dinG regulatory region from the consensus sequence of the LexA-binding box, the double-stranded (ds) 1The abbreviations used are: ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; DSBs, double-strand breaks; XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; SDR, stable DNA replication; iSDR, inducible stable DNA replication. oligonucleotide TTGG(N8)ACAG bound the LexA repressor with high affinity in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (2Lewis L.K.

Still, the presence of the helicase-specific motifs in the protein amino acid sequence per se does not necessarily imply that it is a bona fide helicase.

Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar, 20Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar) was used to amplify a deletion cassette containing the cat gene flanked by FLP recognition target sites and 36-nucleotide extensions homologous to regions of DNA directly surrounding the metB gene. When the deletion cassette was transformed into strain DY330 (W3110 ΔlacU169 gal490 Δcl857 Δ(cro-bioA)) (20Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), expressing λ recombination functions, the cat gene replaced the chromosomal copy of metB. ΔmetB mutants were selected by screening for chloramphenicol resistance and verified by PCR. The dinG gene deletion was created with a similar approach, using plasmid pKD4 (19Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar) to amplify a deletion cassette containing the kan gene and screening for kanamycin resistance. Strain FV002 was constructed by using P1 phage transduction to transfer the metB gene deletion into strain MG1655 (F– λ– ilvG – rfb-50 rph-1). Strain FV004 was constructed by transferring the metB and dinG gene deletions into strain MG1655. The cat and kan genes were removed from the strains by expressing FLP from plasmid pCP20 (19Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar), resulting in 85-nucleotide scars in place of the inserted resistance genes. The dinG gene was amplified from E. coli strain W3110 genomic DNA (Sigma) with either DinG-5′-pET30 and DinG-3′-pET30 or DinG-5′-Xba and DinG-3′-Xho pairs of primers. The former PCR fragment was inserted into the pET-30 Xa/LIC expressing vector (Novagen) with a ligation-independent cloning procedure, resulting in plasmid pET30DinG. The latter PCR fragment was cloned between XbaI and XhoI sites of pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene) yielding plasmid pDinGPro. pET30DinG drives the T7 polymerase-mediated expression of the DinG protein in the form of an 86.5-kDa fusion with a His6 tag and an S tag at the N terminus. The fusion part of the recombinant protein can be cleaved off precisely by treatment with factor Xa, producing the intact 81.5-kDa DinG protein. Constitutive expression of the DinG protein from pDinGPro plasmid was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Nucleotide sequences of the inserts in the created plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. DNAs—All natural and modified oligodeoxynucleotides with switched polarity (21Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380A synthesizer and purified by denaturing PAGE. Sequences of the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides are shown in Table I. M13mp18 ssDNA was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The helicase substrate M1, used in most experiments, was prepared by annealing the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide 55B to M13mp18 ssDNA. Bifurcated substrates, termed D1, P1, P2, and P3, were made by hybridization of oligonucleotides 32P-T8 and B9, 32P-T8–3′–3′ and B9, 32P-T8 and B9–5′–5′, and 32P-T8–3′–3′ and B9–5′–5′, respectively. DNAs were hybridized by slow cooling down from 85 °C to room temperature in annealing buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl at pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2). An excess of free 55B oligonucleotides was separated from annealed M1 substrate by gel filtration on a Chromaspin 400 column (Clontech) equilibrated with annealing buffer. Bifurcated substrates were purified after electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gel and were recovered in annealing buffer. Duplex BS (22Voloshin O.N. Wang L. Camerini-Otero R.D. Science. 1996; 272: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), composed of two fully complementary 53-mer BS-1 and BS-2 oligonucleotides, was gel-purified and stored in TE buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA).

Overnight cultures were prepared in LB media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. One hundred microliters of serial dilutions of the cells were plated on LB plates with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and irradiated with different doses of shortwave UV light from a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). The plates were incubated in the dark overnight at 37 °C, and the colonies derived from surviving cells were counted. Purification of the DinG Protein—Overexpression of the DinG protein was performed in BLR(DE3)pLysS strain (F– ompT hsdS B (rB–mB–) gal dcm Δ(srl-recA)306::Tn10(TcR) (DE3) pLysS (CmR)) transformed with pET30DinG upon induction with IPTG. Four flasks with 1 liter of a bacterial culture in LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol were grown at 37 °C to A 600 = 0.6, and the protein expression was induced with 1 mm IPTG over a 1.5-h period. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 7,000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall SLC-400 rotor, washed with 80 ml of Buffer I (50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and frozen at –70 °C. All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. The cell paste was resuspended in 50 ml of Buffer II (50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 30% glycerol) and sonicated. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 1 h in an SS-34 Sorvall rotor. The supernatant was added to 20 ml of drained and equilibrated with Buffer II Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). Binding of the His6-tagged protein to the resin was done in batch on a rocker overnight. The slurry was transferred to a disposable column and washed 6 times with 12 ml of Buffer II. The protein was eluted with 72 ml of Buffer III (50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 30% glycerol). Fractions of 6 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Three DinG-containing fractions were combined and concentrated to a volume of 10 ml with a Vivaspin 20 concentrator (Sartorius, 50,000 molecular weight cut-off). The buffer was exchanged to Buffer IV (50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 30% glycerol) on a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences), and the sample was applied to a tandem of MonoQ HR 5/5/MonoS HR 5/5 columns (Amersham Biosciences). After the MonoQ column was disconnected, a MonoS column was developed with 80 ml of linear gradient Buffer IV to Buffer V (50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 6.8, 600 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 30% glycerol). Fractions containing DinG (eluted at ∼150 mm NaCl) were pooled and concentrated on Vivaspin 20, and the protein was transferred to Buffer VI (50 mm Tris·HCl at pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 30% glycerol) using a desalting column. The protein was applied to a HiTrap Blue column (Amersham Biosciences) and was eluted with 30 ml of a linear gradient Buffer VI to Buffer VII (50 mm Tris·HCl at pH 8.0, 2 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 30% glycerol). The DinG protein eluted at ∼1 m NaCl was concentrated, dialyzed against Buffer VIII (25 mm Tris·HCl at pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50% glycerol), and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. The concentration of the fusion protein was measured using the extinction coefficient of 80,435 m–1 cm–1 at 278 nm, calculated with a ProtParam tool (www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.html). In all experiments, described in this paper, we use fusion His6 tag-S tag-DinG and refer to it as DinG. Analytical Sizing Chromatography—The molecular mass of DinG in different conditions was determined by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the running buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl at pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μm EDTA). The separation was conducted on a SMART System (Amersham Biosciences) at 40 μl/min. DinG resuspended in the running buffer was injected at concentrations of 0.86 and 20.9 μm. The molecular mass of DinG was estimated as described in the manual of the gel filtration calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences) using a calibration curve obtained with ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ferritin A (440 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), and blue dextran 2000 (≈2000 kDa). Molecular weight markers were run under conditions identical to those used for DinG. ATPase Assay—The steady-state ATPase activity of DinG was measured using a coupled enzymatic system (23Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) as described (24Voloshin O.N. Wang L. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 50 nm DinG protein, 7.8–1000 μm ATP, 42.5 mm Tris·HCl at pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 150 μm β-NADH, 200 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 100 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. If DNA was included in the reaction, its concentration was 6 μm, expressed as the concentration of bases for ssDNA or of base pairs for dsDNA. Hydrolysis reactions were performed in a total volume of 100 μl at 37 °C. The time course of the reaction was monitored using the kinetics mode of a Hewlett-Packard 8453 spectrophotometer equipped with an 89090A temperature controller and Peltier thermostated cell holder. V max and K m values were calculated from the initial rates of ATP hydrolysis using the EnzymeKinetics version 1.11 program (Trinity Software). Helicase Assays—In a typical experiment, 2 nm helicase substrate M1 or 0.5 nm bifurcated substrate was incubated with DinG in 15 μl of the reaction mixture containing 42.5 mm Tris·HCl at pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm ATP. Unless otherwise specified, the concentration of DinG was 100 nm, and incubations were conducted for 20 min. at 30 °C. Every experiment contained a “positive control” in which the helicase substrate was denatured by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min without DinG. We could detect no more than 5% of reannealing of the denatured 2 nm M1 substrate after incubation for 20 min at 30 °C in the standard buffer (data not shown). In some cases, Tris·HCl at pH 8.0 or sodium cacodylate at 6.0 was used instead of Tris·HCl at pH 7.5; ADP or ATPγS was used in place of 2 mm ATP; 5 mm MgCl2 was substituted with 20 mm EDTA, 5 mm ZnCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, or 5 mm CaCl2. After incubation, the reactions were placed on ice and quenched by addition of SDS and EDTA to 1% and 10 mm, respectively. Deproteinized products were separated in 1% TAE-agarose gels for 1.5 h at 5 V/cm (M1 substrates) or in 10% (19:1) TTE-polyacrylamide gels for 1.5 h at 0.25 V/cm (substrates D1, P1, P2, and P3). Gels were dried and quantitated using a BAS 2500 Bio-Imaging Analysis System (Fuji Medical Systems). Percent of the substrate unwound by helicase was calculated using Equation 1: &x0025;=100β(CProd,i-αCSubstr,i)/CTotal,i(Eq. 1) where C Prod,i and C Substr,i are counts of the displaced strand and the remaining substrate, respectively, and C Total,i is their sum. Equation 1 contains two factors α and β, which correct Equation 1 for helicase-independent melting of the substrate and reannealing of the unwound substrates after termination of the reaction. For each set of experiments, the correction factors α and β were calculated using Equation 2 and Equation 3, respectively. α=CProd,0/CSubstr,0(Eq. 2) where C Prod,0 are the counts of the single-stranded oligonucleotide generated during storage of the substrate, and the protein-free incubation in the mock experiment and C Substr,0 are the counts of the intact substrate remaining under the same circumstances. β=CTotal,H/(CProd,H-αCSubstr,H)(Eq. 3) where C Total,H values are the combined counts of the initial substrate C Substr,H and the product C Prod,H in the control experiment where the substrate was heat-denatured. Overexpression and Deletion of dinG Do Not Significantly Impair UV Sensitivity of E. coli Cells—We tested UV sensitivity of the strains lacking and overexpressing dinG. UV resistance of the bacterial cells is one of the manifestations of the SOS response. Fig. 1 shows that both the null mutation of dinG and overexpression of the protein from the multicopy pBlue-script II SK+-derived plasmid confer only a mild UV sensitivity to the FV002 strain, which is wild type with respect to recombination, DNA repair, and replication functions. The lack of severe UV sensitivity in a ΔdinG strain is in agreement with the observation of Yasuda et al. (6Yasuda T. Nagata T. Ohmori H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3854-3859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that inactivation of dinG by mini-Tn10 did not have a considerable effect on the survival of cells with a dnaA5(Ts) rnhA genetic back-ground after UV irradiation. At the same time, these results are different from those for the dinI gene, where deletion of dinI had virtually no effect (7Yasuda T. Morimatsu K. Horii T. Nagata T. Ohmori H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3207-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and its overexpression led to a significant UV sensitivity (7Yasuda T. Morimatsu K. Horii T. Nagata T. Ohmori H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3207-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Voloshin O.N. Ramirez B.E. Bax A. Camerini-Otero R.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Purification of DinG—The fusion DinG protein was expressed in BLR(DE3)pLysS cells carrying the pET30DinG plasmid. Induction with IPTG resulted in appearance of an 86-kDa polypeptide in cell lysates (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 3). Chromatography on Ni2+-NTA was the initial step in the purification procedure (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). Next we used a combination of two ion exchange columns, MonoQ and MonoS, to further purify DinG. Because the theoretical pI of the fusion protein, calculated with a ProtParam tool, is 7.66, it should bind to a cation exchange, but not to an anion exchange, column at pH 6.8. Accordingly, we passed the imidazole elution fractions through a MonoQ-MonoS tandem column at pH 6.8. Impurities with pI values below pH 6.8 bound to the MonoQ column, whereas the fusion protein passed through MonoQ was retained on the MonoS column. After the MonoS column was disconnected, DinG was eluted from MonoS with a salt gradient (Fig. 2, lane 7). Further purification was achieved after chromatography on a HiTrap Blue column (Fig. 2, lane 8). We stored purified DinG at pH 8.0 in a buffer containing 1 m NaCl at –80 °C. Prolonged storage of the protein at pH 7.5 in a low salt buffer resulted in its precipitation. DinG Is a DNA-dependent ATPase—Helicases are molecular motors coupling the ATP hydrolysis to unwinding of the complementary strands of DNA or RNA. NTP binding and hydrolysis is a prerequisite for the strand-separating activity for any of the known helicases. We began the biochemical characterization of DinG with the evaluation of its ATPase activity. As evident from Fig. 3A, DinG possesses an ATPase activity that can be stimulated by DNA. ssDNA and dsDNA differ in their ability to activate the ATPase of the DinG protein. Whereas addition of either a short 53-bp (Fig. 3A) or 3-kb DNA duplex (Table II) resulted in only a slight increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis, single-stranded DNA, either a 55-mer oligonucleotide or long circular M13mp18 DNA, stimulated ATP hydrolysis about 15-fold (Fig. 3A and Table II). ssDNA also reduced the K m for ATP to a greater extent than dsDNA. Kinetic parameters of the ATP-hydrolyzing activity of DinG are summarized in Table II. The ssDNA-stimulated k cat value of 24 s–1 places DinG among the most efficient ATPases in the helicase realm. Typical values of stimulated k cat for helicases range from 0.6 to 30 s–1 (25Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar).Table IIKinetic parameters for the ATPase activity of the DinG proteinKMkcatk cat/KMμMs-1M-1 s-1No DNA752 ± 1721.59 ± 0.22.12 × 103M13mp18 ssDNA167 ± 2524.1 ± 0.921.44 × 105pBluescript II SK+422 ± 322.32 ± 0.16.71 × 103linearized withHindIII Open table in a new tab In order to estimate the minimum number of nucleotidebinding sites involved in the ATP hydrolysis reaction, we fitted our kinetic data to the Hill equation. A Hill coefficient of 1, which is the slope of the line in Fig. 3B, suggests only one ATP-binding site per DinG molecule. This is consistent with, although it does not prove, the idea that DinG functions as a monomer during ATP hydrolysis. DinG Exists as a Monomer in Solution—We used gel filtration to estimate the assembly state of purified DinG in solution. Irrespective of the protein concentration (0.86 or 20.9 μm), DinG eluted as a globular protein with a molecular mass of 74–86 kDa (Fig. 4). This indicates that DinG is a monomer in solution, in accord with the value of the Hill coefficient of 1. In order to minimize nonspecific protein associations and prevent protein precipitation, we performed all the gel filtration experiments in 1 m NaCl, conditions quite different from the intracellular environment. Furthermore, the fact that the helicase is present as a monomer in solution does not necessarily imply that the functional form of the enzyme is monomeric. Helicases can oligomerize when bound to nucleotide cofactors and DNA substrates. Models for DNA unwinding that utilize monomeric, dimeric, and hexameric helicases have been proposed (25Patel S.S.

Here we report that human GTSE-1 (hGTSE-1) protein can negatively regulate p53 transactivation function, protein levels, and p53-dependent apoptosis. We identified a physical interaction between the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53 and the C-terminal region of hGTSE-1 that is necessary and sufficient to down-regulate p53 activity. Furthermore, we provide evidence that hGTSE-1 is able to control p53 function in a cell cycle-dependent fashion. hGTSE-1 knock-down by small interfering RNA resulted in a S/G2-specific increase of p53 levels as well as cell sensitization to DNA damage-induced apoptosis during these phases of the cell cycle. Altogether, this work suggests a physiological role of hGTSE-1 in apoptosis control after DNA damage during S and G2 phases through regulation of p53 function.

Altogether, this work suggests a physiological role of hGTSE-1 in apoptosis control after DNA damage during S and G2 phases through regulation of p53 function. Cellular response to DNA damage efficiently induces cell growth arrest or apoptosis through a complex network of regulatory pathways. A key element in the integration of these pathways is the tumor suppressor protein p53. The function of p53 as tumor suppressor is mainly ascribable to its activity as a transcription factor that specifically activates genes in response to various types of stress, including DNA damage, oncogene activation, hypoxia, and cell adhesion (1Bates S. Vousden K.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). When the p53 response is activated, p53-inducible genes can mainly induce growth arrest, the repair of damaged DNA, or apoptosis (2Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). The major mechanisms that govern p53 activity appear to be exerted at the protein level. This includes regulation of p53 protein stability, control of its subcellular localization, and post-translational modifications as well as conformational changes that allow activation of the DNA-binding ability of p53 (3Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The key negative regulator of p53 is the proto-oncogene Mdm2. The proposed mechanism by which Mdm2 negatively regulates p53 function involves Mdm2 binding to the N-terminal region of p53 and its ubiquitination (4Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M.

Wild-type p53 (wt-p53) induces GTSE-1 transcription by an active p53-binding site located in the promoter region; however, similar to other p53 target genes, GTSE-1 is also induced by DNA damage independent of p53 status (6Utrera R.

Benetti, L. Collavin, and C. Schneider, manuscript in preparation.2M. Monte, R. Benetti, L. Collavin, and C. Schneider, manuscript in preparation. GTSE-1 protein is cell cycle-regulated with increased expression during S and G2 phases. It becomes phosphorylated in mitosis and markedly reduced in G1 (7Collavin L. Monte M. Verardo R. Pfleger C. Schneider C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Overexpression of GTSE-1 resulted in a delay of the G2 to M phase transition independent of p53 (6Utrera R. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Delia D. Schneider C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5015-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The same cell cycle regulation, cellular localization, and the ability to delay the G2 phase have been also observed for the GTSE-1 human homologue protein, hGTSE-1 (8Monte M. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Utrera R. Dragani T.A. Schneider C. Gene. 2000; 254: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Here we report that hGTSE-1 can control DNA damage-induced apoptosis by regulating p53 stability and function. We provide evidence that hGTSE-1 protein can negatively regulate p53 levels and activity, thus affecting DNA damage-induced apoptosis in wt-p53 cells. The proposed mechanism by which hGTSE-1 regulates p53 activity involves a physical interaction between the C-terminal region of hGTSE-1 and the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53. Moreover, hGTSE-1 knock-down (KD) by small interference RNA (siRNA) resulted in S/G2-specific increase of p53 levels and cell sensitization to DNA damage-induced apoptosis during these cell cycle phases, thus implying that endogenous hGTSE-1 plays a role in p53-dependent apoptosis control during the cell cycle window where it is physiologically expressed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and TreatmentsU2OS (wt-p53) and MG-63 (p53 null) human osteosarcoma cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells treated with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (Fluka) were incubated for 4 h with the drug, followed by extensive washing and medium replacement until the end of the treatment. Etoposide (ET) (Sigma) treatment consisted of the addition of ET for the indicated time.PlasmidsFor transient transfection experiments, pcDNA3-hGTSE-1 containing full-length hGTSE-1 cDNA (8Monte M. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Utrera R. Dragani T.A. Schneider C. Gene. 2000; 254: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was used. The N-terminal hGTSE-1 construct (NT-hGTSE-1) encodes for a deletion mutant of hGTSE-1 from amino acids 1–476 inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The C-terminal hGTSE-1 construct (CT-hGTSE-1) encodes for a deletion mutant of hGTSE-1 from amino acids 476–720 inserted into pcDNA3.1 with a His6 N-terminal tag (Invitrogen). GFP·hGTSE-1 contains the full-length hGTSE-1 fused to GFP (pEGFP vector, Clontech). pcDNA3-p53wt contains the full-length human wt-p53 cDNA. The p53 reporter plasmid employed for luciferase assays was the pG13-Luc, which contains 13 repeats of a p53 consensus sequence. GFP·p53 contains human wild-type p53 fused to the GFP protein.Transfection and Reporter Gene AssayDNA—Expression vectors were transfected in mid-log growth phase U2OS cells using the calcium phosphate method. Unless stated otherwise, cells were analyzed 24 h after transfection.siRNA—Transfection of siRNA (Dharmacon Research) was performed as described by Elbashir et al. (9Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8081) Google Scholar) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Reporter plasmid and siRNA cotransfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer for siRNA in adherent cells. In all cases, medium without antibiotics was used. The hGTSE-1 mRNA targeted sequence was AAAUUUGACUUCGAUCUUUCA (sihGTSE-1). The control siRNA used was AACCUUUUUUUUUGGGGAAAA (siCONT). siRNA for human p53 was designed as described by Brummelkamp et al. (10Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar).For luciferase assay, cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid (pG13-Luc) and a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase, pRL-CMV. The assay was performed with a dual luciferase kit (Promega). Renilla luciferase activity was used to standardize p53 activation values for transfection efficiency.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot AnalysisCells were harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. Lysis was performed at 4 °C for 10 min. The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation and precleared with 20 μl of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences). Then antibody prebound to 20 μl of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was added and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. The resin was washed, and bound proteins were eluated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer.Western blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures using the following primary antibodies: affinity-purified LF1 anti-hGTSE-1 polyclonal antibody, DO-1 anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-actin polyclonal antibody (Sigma), and N20 anti-Bax polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound primary antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) after addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.Immunofluorescence, Apoptosis, Flow Cytometry, and in Vitro Binding AssayImmunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, treated with Triton X-100, and stained using specific antibodies followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate or RITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Images were analyzed with a laser scan confocal microscope (Leica).Apoptosis—Cell death was assessed by scoring apoptotic morphology of the nucleus stained with propidium iodide (P.I.) by counting at least 200 cells on each experiment.Flow Cytometry—After siRNA transfection and ET treatment, cells were harvested by trypsin treatment and fixed with cold 70% ethanol. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were treated with RNase A, and then DNA was stained with propidium iodide (25 μg/ml). Cytometric analysis was performed on a Bryte HS (Bio-Rad) cytofluorimeter. Cell sorting was performed by a FACSventage instrument (Becton-Dickinson) as reported by Delia et al. (11Delia D. Goi K. Mizutani S. Yamada T. Aiello A. Fontanella E. Lamorte G. Iwata S. Ishioka C. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Pierotti M.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2137-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).In Vitro Binding Assay— 35S-labeled proteins were in vitro translated using reticulocyte lysates (TNT system; Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with purified GST or GST·p53 or GST·p53 deletion mutants immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Bound proteins were eluted and resolved in SDS-PAGE.RESULTShGTSE-1 Alleviates DNA Damage-induced Apoptosis in Cells Harboring Functional p53—We have previously reported that mouse or human GTSE-1 was able to delay the G2 progression when overexpressed (6Utrera R. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Delia D. Schneider C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5015-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Monte M. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Utrera R. Dragani T.A. Schneider C. Gene. 2000; 254: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we investigated whether this effect on the cell cycle was also accompanied by interference in DNA damage-induced cell death. To approach this topic we overexpressed hGTSE-1 in two human osteosarcoma cell lines containing wt-p53 (U2OS) and p53 null (MG-63). We first compared the effect of hGTSE-1 ectopic expression in both cell types in terms of cell cycle profile. As shown in Fig. 1A, U2OS and MG-63 cells responded similarly to hGTSE-1 overexpression, delaying the G2 progression. Then MG-63 and U2OS cells were transfected with GFP or GFP-tagged hGTSE-1 expression vectors. 24 h later cells were treated with DNA damaging agents, such as ET or methyl methanesulfonate. ET (final concentration 100 μm) was added to the culture medium for 18 h. Methyl methanesulfonate (final concentration 100 μm) was added for 4 h, after which it was removed and replaced with normal medium for an additional 14 h. Apoptosis was then assessed by scoring nuclear alteration in transfected cells as we described previously (12Benetti R. Del Sal G. Monte M. Paroni G. Brancolini C. Schneider C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2702-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, GFP·hGTSE-1 expression decreased the apoptotic response induced by both ET and methyl methanesulfonate in U2OS cells, whereas no evidence of apoptotic protection was observed in MG-63 cells. Fig. 1C shows an indicative field of the difference in nuclear morphology in cells treated with ET overexpressing, or not, GFP·hGTSE-1. These results suggest a potential role of hGTSE-1 in regulating the p53-dependent apoptotic process. As can be noted in Fig. 1C, hGTSE-1, which mainly localizes to the microtubules in unstressed cells (6Utrera R. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Delia D. Schneider C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5015-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Monte M. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Utrera R. Dragani T.A. Schneider C. Gene. 2000; 254: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), accumulates into the nucleus after damage. This is in agreement with recently obtained data indicating that hGTSE-1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that can be relocalized to the nucleus in response to DNA damage signals, with potential consequences in controlling p53-dependent functions.2To directly assess the role of hGTSE-1 in p53-induced apoptosis, we used a well characterized model based on wt-p53 overexpression in Saos-2 cells. wt-p53-expressing vector was transfected together with GFP·hGTSE-1 or GFP alone. 48 h later, cells were fixed and stained using an anti-p53 polyclonal antibody, and the apoptotic nuclei were scored in cotransfected cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, GFP·hGTSE-1 significantly reduced p53-induced apoptosis when compared with cells transfected with GFP alone, thus confirming that hGTSE-1 overexpression could efficiently interfere with p53 proapoptotic activity.We next investigated the role of endogenous hGTSE-1 in apoptosis induced by DNA damage. For this purpose we designed siRNA to KD hGTSE-1 protein expression in human cells. The ability of the specific siRNA for hGTSE-1 (named sihGTSE-1) to down-regulate hGTSE-1 protein levels was tested in U2OS cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, 40 h after sihGTSE-1 transfection, expression of endogenous hGTSE-1 protein was almost completely abolished. A scrambled siRNA (named siCONT) was used as control.Fig. 2Endogenous hGTSE-1 regulates cells susceptibility to DNA damage-induced apoptosis.

D, analysis of apoptosis induced by ET treatment in cells with down-regulated levels of hGTSE-1, p53, or both as indicted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To address the physiological role of hGTSE-1 in DNA-damaged cells, U2OS cells were transfected with siCONT or sihGTSE-1. 40 h after siRNA transfection, cells were treated with 50 μm ET. Apoptosis was then determined as subG1 population by using flow cytometry analysis. As observed in Fig. 2B, hGTSE-1/knock-down (hGTSE-1/KD) cells displayed an increased subG1 population after ET when compared with control cells. Fig. 2C shows a representative field evidencing the enhancement of apoptotic nuclei induced by ET treatment in hGTSE-1/KD cells when compared with cells transfected with control siRNA. The obtained data suggest that hGTSE-1 knockdown significantly sensitizes cells to undergo apoptotic cell death upon treatment with DNA-damaging agents.Finally, to analyze the involvement of p53 in apoptosis induced by DNA damage in hGTSE-1/KD cells, the effect of ET treatment was evaluated in hGTSE-1/p53 double knock-down cells. U2OS cells were transfected with sihGTSE-1, sip53 (siRNA specific for p53 silencing, Brummelkamp et al., Ref. 10Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar), and their combination as indicated in Fig. 2D. sip53 efficiency to down-regulate p53 levels was about 80–90% as determined by Western blotting (data not shown). Although in the absence of damage no significant apoptosis was detected, hGTSE-1/KD cells displayed enhanced cell death compared with cells transfected with control siRNA when treated with ET. Interestingly, p53 silencing significantly rescued susceptibility of hGTSE-1/K D cells to ET-induced apoptosis. These data and those presented in Fig. 1B indicate that p53 is a key element for hGTSE-1-dependent control of apoptosis upon DNA damage.hGTSE-1 Expression Regulates p53 Activity and Protein Levels—Because we obtained evidence pointing to a role of hGTSE-1 in p53-dependent apoptosis after DNA damage, we investigated the functional activity of p53 in cells expressing different levels of hGTSE-1. We first established a U2OS cell line with hGTSE-1 expression under the control of tetracycline. p53 protein levels were determined in cell lysates of all seven hGTSE-1-inducible clones obtained after 24 h of tetracycline removal. As shown in two representative clones (Fig. 3A), p53 levels strongly decreased after hGTSE-1 induction, suggesting that overexpressed hGTSE-1 is able to reduce endogenous levels of p53. We then determined p53 transactivation activity in U2OS cells transiently cotransfected with a synthetic promoter containing multiple p53 binding sites (pG13-Luc) together with hGTSE-1 or an empty vector. As shown in Fig. 3B, overexpression of hGTSE-1 efficiently down-regulated endogenous p53-driven transactivation activity, altogether suggesting that hGTSE-1 could exert resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis at least in part by regulating p53.Fig. 3Regulation of p53 by hGTSE-1 expression. A, p53 protein levels after induction of hGTSE-1 expression in two representative hGTSE-1 tet-inducible clones. B, effect of hGTSE-1 ectopic expression on p53 transactivation activity using the pG13-Luc reporter in U2OS cells. pRL-CMV vector (Renilla luciferase) was cotransfected to normalize transfection efficiency. Arbitrary units of luciferase corresponding to each transfection are indicated. C, determination of p53 protein levels after hGTSE-1 silencing by transfecting sihGTSE-1 in U2OS cells. D, analysis of p53 transactivation activity in knock-down hGTSE-1 cells using pG13-Luc as reporter as described in panel B. E, p53, phosphorylated-p53, and Bax protein levels in cells with normal or down-regulated levels of hGTSE-1 protein treated or not with ET. F, p53 transactivation activity in cells containing normal or down-regulated levels of hGTSE-1 protein treated or not with ET using the pG13-Luc reporter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)p53 levels and activity were then determined in cells expressing lower levels of hGTSE-1 protein by siRNA-hGTSE-1 silencing. In agreement with hGTSE-1 overexpression data, down-regulation of endogenous hGTSE-1 resulted in a moderate increase of p53 protein level (Fig. 3C). Consistently, enhancement of p53 transactivation was detected after quantification of the pG13-Luc reporter activity when cotransfected with sihGTSE-1 (Fig. 3D).Although silencing of hGTSE-1 increased p53 levels and activity in unstressed cells, it failed to stimulate apoptotic cell death. This fact could indicate that the amount of accumulated p53 in hGTSE-1/K D cells is not sufficient to induce apoptosis or that accumulated p53 is not fully active or efficiently modified to trigger the apoptotic process. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed p53 levels and activity in hGTSE-1/K D cells exposed or not to ET treatment (25 μm for 18 h). Phosphorylation of p53 in serine 15 is a key event during its full activation (13Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 31: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Using a p53-Ser-15 phospho-specific antibody, we observed that hGTSE-1 knock-down did not induce detectable p53 phosphorylation in the absence of damage, whereas it followed p53 increments in ET-treated cells. Consistently, levels of the p53-induced proapoptotic protein Bax remained unchanged in unstressed hGTSE-1/K D cells, whereas its up-regulation was clearly detected after ET treatment (Fig. 3E). Finally, when p53 transactivation function was assessed using the pG13-Luc reporter, we observed that hGTSE-1 silencing could significantly enhance p53 activity even in cells treated with ET (Fig. 3F), thus concluding that increased p53 levels due to hGTSE-1 silencing should synergize with DNA damage-dependent p53 stabilization and activation, therefore providing a more robust p53 response when compared with cells expressing normal levels of hGTSE-1 protein.hGTSE-1 Physically Interacts with p53—Looking for possible mechanisms linking hGTSE-1 expression with p53 regulation, we investigated whether hGTSE-1 could physically interact with p53. hGTSE-1/p53 interaction was analyzed in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation assay. U2OS cells were cotransfected with vectors expressing hGTSE-1 and the GFP·p53 fusion protein. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with hGTSE-1 antiserum and immunoblotted using the DO-1 anti-p53 monoclonal antibody. The results demonstrate that hGTSE-1 and p53 can bind to each other because the 90-kDa GFP·p53 protein specifically immunoprecipitated with the anti-hGTSE-1 antiserum (Fig. 4A). To obtain evidence that this association could occur between the respective endogenous products, U2OS cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with DO-1 anti-p53 antibody or 9E10 anti-Myc antibody as control. Fig. 4B shows that endogenous p53 and hGTSE-1 can physically interact, because hGTSE-1 coprecipitated when DO-1 antibody was used. Similar results were also obtained in HCT116 cells (data not shown).Fig. 4Interaction between hGTSE-1 and p53. A, hGTSE-1 and GFP·p53 proteins were overexpressed in U2OS cells and immunoprecipitated using hGTSE-1 antiserum or normal rabbit serum (NRS) as control. p53 was detected using the DO-1 anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (upper panel). Immunoprecipitated hGTSE-1 was determined in the same membrane (lower panel). B, endogenous hGTSE-1 and p53 complex was assessed in U2OS cells lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 DO-1 monoclonal antibody. 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was used as control. hGTSE-1 protein was detected using the LF1b anti-hGTSE-1 antibody (upper panel). Immunoprecipitated p53 was determined in the same membrane (lower panel). C, the GST·p53 and hGTSE-1 constructs used for in vitro binding experiments. D, In vitro binding assay using 35S-IVT full-length hGTSE-1 (Input) incubated with purified GST·p53 constructs coupled to glutathione-Sepharose matrix.

The control was performed by transfecting the same amount of an empty pcDNA3 vector together with pG13-Luc.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then performed in vitro binding experiments to define the interaction region between hGTSE-1 and p53. In vitro translated (IVT) 35S-labeled hGTSE-1 protein was incubated with different GST·p53 deletions described in Fig. 4C. As shown in Fig. 4D, hGTSE-1 was bound by the C-terminal region of p53 (amino acids 355–393), which has been established as a p53 regulatory domain crucial for the control of its transactivation function.The region of hGTSE-1 that is able to bind p53 was then determined by using IVTs of two hGTSE-1 constructs coding from amino acid 1 to 476 (NT-hGTSE-1) and from amino acid 476 to 720 (CT-hGTSE-1). These deletions were tested for in vitro binding to the full-length p53 (GST·p53) as described above. As shown in Fig. 4E, CT-hGTSE-1 was preferentially retained on the beads containing GST·p53, supporting the existence of a direct interaction between the C-terminal regions of hGTSE-1 and p53.To confirm the data obtained in in vitro assays, the effect of NT-hGTSE-1 and CT-hGTSE-1 deletion mutants on endogenous p53 transactivation function was assessed in U2OS cells. p53 activity was analyzed in transiently transfected cells with the indicated hGTSE-1 constructs together with the pG13-Luc reporter. As shown in Fig. 4F, the construct lacking the region involved in p53 binding (NT-hGTSE-1) completely lost the ability to down-regulate p53 activity when compared with the full-length protein. Interestingly, the CT-hGTSE-1 deletion mutant maintained full ability to repress p53 transactivation activity, thus suggesting that hGTSE-1 regulation of p53 activity correlates with its ability to bind p53. Moreover, the hGTSE-1 region involved in p53 binding is necessary and sufficient to repress p53 transactivation function. hGTSE-1 Plays a Role in DNA Damage-induced Cell Death during the S and G 2 Phases—hGTSE-1 protein is specifically expressed during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (8Monte M. Collavin L. Lazarevic D. Utrera R. Dragani T.A. Schneider C. Gene. 2000; 254: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with an expression profile similar to that of cyclin A. This behavior could indicate that endogenous hGTSE-1 may regulate p53 in a cell cycle-specific manner. To address this topic, U2OS cells were transfected with sihGTSE-1 or siCONT, and 40 h later the DNA dye Hoechst 33342 was added to the culture medium. Using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS, Becton-Dickinson), cells in G1 phase (DNA content, 2N) and those in S/G2/M phases (DNA content, more than 2N to 4N) were separated, and p53 levels were determined in all fractions. As shown in Fig. 5A, although siRNA-dependent hGTSE-1 silencing did not affect p53 levels of G1 phase cells, it specifically increased p53 protein levels in cells passing S/G2/M phases, indicating that hGTSE-1 is a cell cycle-specific regulator of p53.Fig. 5hGTSE-1 control of p53 and p53-dependent apoptosis is cell cycle-regulated.

https://openalex.org/W2035628161,"Stable isotope-based dynamic metabolic profiling is applied in this paper to elucidate the mechanism by which butyrate induces cell differentiation in HT29 cells. We utilized butyrate-sensitive (HT29) cells incubated with [1,2-13C2]glucose or [1,2-13C2]butyrate as single tracers to observe the changes in metabolic fluxes in these cells. In HT29 cells, increasing concentrations of butyrate inhibited glucose uptake, glucose oxidation, and nucleic acid ribose synthesis in a dose-dependent fashion. Glucose carbon utilization for de novo fatty acid synthesis and tricarboxylic acid cycle flux was replaced by butyrate. We also demonstrated that these changes are not present in butyrate-resistant pancreatic adenocarcinoma MIA cells. The results suggest that the mechanism by which colon carcinoma cells acquire a differentiated phenotype is through a replacement of glucose for butyrate as the main carbon source for macromolecule biosynthesis and energy production. This provides a better understanding of cell differentiation through metabolic adaptive changes in response to butyrate in HT29 cells, demonstrating that variations in metabolic pathway substrate flow are powerful regulators of tumor cell proliferation and differentiation.

Butyrate is a four-carbon short chain fatty acid produced by fermentation of fiber polysaccharides by the intestinal microflora of the human colon (1Miller T.L. Wolin M.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Butyrate is utilized primarily by colon epithelial cells as a substrate for energy production (2Roediger W.E.W. Gastroenterology. 1982; 83: 424-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar).

To assess how known genetic modifications can be translated into metabolic changes characteristic of differentiated cells, techniques allowing analysis of the levels of low molecular weight compounds are required. Stable isotope-based dynamic metabolic profiling using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) 1The abbreviations used are: GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; IRMS, isotope ratio mass spectrometer.1The abbreviations used are: GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; IRMS, isotope ratio mass spectrometer. is a new tool with a largely untapped potential in the field of functional genomics. In this paper we demonstrate the usefulness of this technique to elucidate the metabolic mechanism underlying butyrate induced cell differentiation.The task will be performed using metabolomic and fluxomic analysis to investigate whether butyrate-induced differentiation in HT29 (butyrate-sensitive) colon and MIA (butyrate-resistant) pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells involves the reversion of metabolic reactions characteristic of undifferentiated cells. Such results would strongly support the importance of gene-nutrient interactions on the platform of cellular metabolic pathways and the level of their intermediates as key metabolic signals/ligands to the transcriptional regulation of mammalian cell growth and differentiation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and Culture—HT29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells and MIA pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection) were grown in minimum essential medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 for 3 days before the start of the experiments. Just prior to butyrate treatment and stable isotope labeling, the medium was removed and fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with l-glutamine, without glucose and without sodium pyruvate; Invitrogen) was added with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm of glucose and increasing doses of butyrate (0, 0.1, 1, and 5 or 10 mm), for 72 h. Two separate experiments were performed in each cell line: 1) to study the effect of butyrate on glucose metabolism, cells were incubated with [1,2-13C2]glucose (50% isotope enrichment) and increasing doses of butyrate; and 2) when the metabolism of butyrate itself was studied, the cultured cells were incubated with unlabeled glucose but increasing doses of [1,2-13C2]butyrate (50% isotope enrichment). Stable [1,2-13C2]d-glucose and [1,2-13C2]butyrate isotopes were purchased with >99% purity and 99% isotope enrichment for each position (Isotec Inc., Miamisburg, OH).Cell cultures were started with the same cell number (2 × 105), which was achieved using standard cell counting techniques. At the end of the experiment, the final cell numbers were also measured with these standard procedures. HT29 and MIA cells were selected for the study because HT29 differentiate with butyrate, whereas MIA cells do not. The metabolic differences of these cell lines are reported in order to reveal differentiation-specific carbon flow and substrate redistribution changes in tumor cells.Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—This enzyme activity was measured as a marker of the degree of cell differentiation after butyrate treatment according to the published procedures (15Bergmeyer H.V. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1974: 860-864Crossref Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase was expressed as nmol of substrate converted per min and per mg of protein. Protein determination was done using the BCA protein assay (Pierce).Glucose and Lactate—The levels of glucose and lactate in media were measured using a Cobas Mira chemistry analyzer (Roche Applied Science). Glucose and butyrate oxidation by the cells was determined by media 13C/12C ratios in released CO2 by a Finnegan Delta-S isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) (16Kasho V.N. Cheng S. Jensen D.M. Ajie H. Lee W.N. Faller L.D. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 10: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To obtain the CO2 from the medium, 200 μl of the cell medium were added to a hermetically closed vial, and then 50 μlof0.1 m NaHCO3 and 50 μl of 0.12 n HCl were added to react with the medium and liberate the CO2, which was injected directly into the IRMS. The value obtained from the spectrometer is δ13/12, which is equal to the ratio between 13C and 12C from the sample minus the 13C/12C from the reference (air) divided from the ratio of the reference. Release of 13CO2 was measured to estimate glucose or butyrate carbon utilization through oxidation by the cell lines and was expressed as the difference between the amount released by each treatment and the amount released by the control.Lactate from the cell culture medium was extracted by ethyl acetate after acidification with HCl. Lactate was derivatized to its propylamide-heptafluorobutyric form and the m/z 328 (carbons 1–3 of lactate, chemical ionization) was monitored for the detection of m1 (recycled lactate through the pentose cycle) and m2 (lactate produced by glycolysis) for the estimation of pentose cycle activity (17Lee W.N. Boros L.G. Puigjaner J. Bassilian S. Lim S. Cascante M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E843-E851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unlabeled species (m0) represents corrected lactate mass isotopomer distribution without 13C label, m1 with one 13C label and m2 with two 13C labels. m2 originates from glucose that is converted to lactate directly by glycolysis, whereas m1 originates from glucose metabolized by direct oxidation via the oxidative steps of the pentose phosphate pathways and then recycled to glycolysis via the non-oxidative pentose cycle. From these results, we can predict pentose cycle flux relative to the glycolytic flux, and it is calculated by the m1/m2 ratio in lactate (17Lee W.N. Boros L.G. Puigjaner J. Bassilian S. Lim S. Cascante M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E843-E851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).RNA Ribose—RNA ribose was isolated by acid hydrolysis of cellular RNA after Trizol purification of cell extracts. Ribose isolated from RNA was derivatized to its aldonitrile acetate form using hydroxyl-amine in pyridine and acetic anhydride. We monitored the ion cluster around the m/z 256 (carbons 1–5 of ribose, chemical ionization) to find the molar enrichment and positional distribution of 13C labels in ribose (17Lee W.N. Boros L.G. Puigjaner J. Bassilian S. Lim S. Cascante M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E843-E851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Glutamate—Glutamate was separated from the cell medium using ion-exchange chromatography (18Katz J. Lee W.N. Wals P.A. Bergner E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12994-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamate was converted to its n-trifluoroacetyl-n-butyl derivative and the ion clusters m/z 198 (carbons 2–5 of glutamate, electron impact ionization) and m/z 152 (carbons 2–4 of glutamate, electron impact ionization) were monitored. The different isotopomers of glutamate allowed us to determine the parameter Y, which is the anaplerotic flux (pyruvate carboxylase) related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux (expressed as the fraction of oxaloacetate entering and completing a full turn of the tricarboxylic acid cycle) (19Lee W.N.P. Edmond J. Bassilian S. Morrow J.W. Dev. Neurosci. 1996; 18: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Fatty Acids—Fatty acids were extracted by saponification of the Trizol cell extract after removal of the RNA-containing supernatant. Cell debris was treated with 30% KOH and 100% ethanol overnight, and the extraction was performed using petroleum ether. Fatty acids were converted to their methylated derivative using 0.5 n methanolic HCl. Palmitate was monitored at m/z 270 and stearate at m/z 298. The enrichment of acetyl units in HT29 and MIA cells in response to butyrate treatment was determined using the mass isotopomer distribution analysis approach of different isotopomers of palmitate, an abundant cell membrane lipid readily recovered by biological mass spectrometry from cell pellets (20Lee W.N. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 399: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Lipid synthesis is also dependent on glucose carbons, as they are the primary source of acetyl-CoA, which is then incorporated into fatty acids through de novo synthesis (C16, palmitate). Acetyl-CoA enrichment was calculated from the m4/m2 ratio using the formula m4/m2 = (n – 1)/2·(p/q), where n is the number of acetyl units, p is the labeled fraction, and q is the unlabeled fraction (p + q = 1).Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectral data were obtained on the HP5973 mass selective detector connected to an HP6890 gas chromatograph. The settings are as follows: GC inlet 230 °C, transfer line 280 °C, MS source 230 °C, MS quad 150 °C. An HP-5 capillary column (30-m length, 250-μm diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness) was used for analysis of glucose, ribose, glutamate, and lactate. A Bpx70 column (25-m length, 220-μm diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness; SGE Incorporated, Austin, TX) was used for fatty acid analysis with specific temperature programming for each compound studied.Data Analysis and Statistical Methods—In vitro experiments were carried out using three cultures each time for each treatment regimen and then repeated twice. Mass spectral analyses were carried out by three independent automatic injections of 1 μl of each sample by the automatic sampler and were accepted only if the standard sample deviation was less than 1% of the normalized peak intensity. Statistical analyses were performed using the parametric unpaired, two-tailed independent sample t test with 99% confidence intervals. p < 0.01 was considered to indicate significant differences in glucose carbon metabolism in HT29 and MIA cell cultures treated with increasing doses of butyrate.RESULTSEffect of Butyrate on Cell Differentiation—The anti-proliferative/cell differentiating effect of sodium butyrate was evident in HT29 cells by an increase in cell differentiation, as assessed by the increase in the activity of the differentiation marker enzyme alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 1) as well as by a visible change in cell morphology. Glucose consumption decreased in a dose-dependent manner in HT29 cells after 0.1, 1 and 5 mm of butyrate, whereas MIA cells did not show any decrease in glucose consumption or cell differentiation (Fig. 2). Lactate production was also decreased in a dose-dependent manner in HT29 cells after 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 mm butyrate treatment, whereas MIA cells continued high lactate production (see Fig. 2). These results indicate that glycolysis substrate flow readily responds to butyrate only in differentiating HT29, but not in MIA cells.Fig. 2Effect of butyrate on glucose consumption and on lactate production. The results of each isotope experiment were combined to show the changes in medium glucose or lactate concentration after a 72-h incubation. Triplicates were performed for each butyrate concentration with a total n = 12. **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Butyrate Metabolism in HT29 and MIA Cells—β-Oxidation of butyrate produces acetyl-CoA, which can either be oxidized in the mitochondria via the tricarboxylic acid cycle or reutilized for de novo lipogenesis. Thus, oxidation of butyrate generates acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, both being potent metabolic regulators of glucose and fatty acid oxidation. β-Oxidation of [1,2-13C2]butyrate generates [1,2-13C2]acetyl-CoA, which can be incorporated into carbon 4 and 5 of glutamate, which is in equilibrium with α-ketoglutarate. The measurement of enrichment in C-4–C-5 of glutamate reflects the utilization of butyrate in energy production. In experiments with [1,2-13C2]glucose and unlabeled butyrate, the unlabeled acetyl-CoA from butyrate dilutes the enrichment of C-4–C-5 of glutamate. These results are shown in Fig. 3. When [1,2-13C2]butyrate was used as the tracer, the enrichment of m2 C-4–C-5 of glutamate steadily increased in both cell lines, reflecting the increasing butyrate β-oxidation. The HT29 cells were able to metabolize butyrate better than the MIA cells, as demonstrated by the higher m2 enrichment in glutamate. The high acetyl-CoA enrichment in HT29 cells resulted in the combination of 13C in carbons 3 and 4 generating m2 C-2–C-3 in α-ketoglutarate, as the first labeled molecule continues through the tricarboxylic acid cycle as oxaloacetate. When [1,2-13C2]glucose was used as the tracer, increasing butyrate β-oxidation and suppression of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity contributed to the decreasing enrichment in m2 C-4–C-5 of glutamate in both cell lines. [1,2-13C2]Glucose can also label carbons 2 and 3 of glutamate via pyruvate carboxylase. The decrease in the label of the upper part of the glutamate molecule (m2 C-2–C-3) indicates a decrease in the pyruvate carboxylase activity. Because anaplerosis relative to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Y) remained relatively unchanged or was increased, unlabeled substrates must have entered the tricarboxylic acid cycle to make up for the decrease in pyruvate carboxylase activity.Fig. 3Butyrate metabolism and its effect on tricarboxylic acid cycle as determined by mass isotopomers of glutamate. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity relative to β-oxidation (m2 C-4–C-5) is calculated by subtracting m2 of m/z 152 from m2 of m/z 198 fragments. The enrichment depends of how much butyrate is β-oxidized instead of glucose. Pyruvate carboxylase activity (m2 C-2–C-3) is the m2 from the m/z 152 fragment of glutamate. Y is calculated using the formula Y = (1 – r)/r, where r = [(m1/m2)/(1 + 0.5(m1/m2)] and is the anaplerotic flux relative to the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01. In the case of labeled butyrate, m2 (C-2–C-3) is obtained because of the high acetyl-CoA enrichment coming from butyrate that is recycled by the tricarboxylic acid cycle; this labeled glutamate is not related to the pyruvate carboxylase activity and hence is marked not applicable (N/A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)β-Oxidation of butyrate also contributes to the precursor pool of malonyl-CoA for de novo lipogenesis. Incubation with labeled butyrate showed a dose response increase in the incorporation of labeled acetyl-CoA in palmitate synthesis, indicating a switch between the utilization of glucose and butyrate for fatty acid synthesis. This increase was higher in the differentiated HT29 cells than in MIA cells (Fig. 4). For the same reason, the decreased label incorporation into the fatty acids of MIA cells from [1,2-13C2]glucose due to dilution by unlabeled acetyl-CoA from butyrate was less prominent than in HT29 cells.Fig. 4Utilization of glucose and butyrate for lipid synthesis as determined for palmitate isotopomers. Acetyl-CoA enrichment is calculated from the mass isotopomer ratio of palmitate using the formula p = (m4/m2)/[3.5 + (m4/m2)]. “% contribution” is the Acetyl-CoA enrichment divided by the theoretical enrichment derived from glucose or butyrate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Butyrate on [1,2-13C 2 ]Butyrate and [1,2-13C 2 ]-Glucose Oxidation— 13CO2 release in the cell media was determined by IRMS as the enrichment of CO2 after the addition of an excess amount of NaHCO3 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The difference in enrichment from that of preincubation medium is expressed as variation in δ (Δδ) representing the released of 13CO2 from oxidation of labeled substrate. When [1,2-13C2]butyrate was used as a tracer in HT29 cells, there was a dose-dependent increase in 13CO2 release indicating the intense oxidation of butyrate by these cells (Fig. 5). However, the intense oxidation of butyrate was not observed in MIA cells. The regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by acetyl-CoA results in decreased glucose oxidation. As expected, increasing doses of butyrate reduced glucose oxidation in both HT29 and MIA cells (Fig. 5). However, the inhibitory effect of butyrate on glucose oxidation in MIA cells was less prominent than that in HT29 cells. The data in HT29 and MIA cells together suggest a diminished mitochondrial oxidation of substrate in butyrate treatment.Fig. 5Effect of butyrate on the oxidation of [1,2-13C2]glucose and [1,2-13C2]butyrate. 13CO2 release in the medium was determined by IRMS as the enrichment of CO2 after the addition of an excess amount of NaHCO3 (see “Materials and Methods”). The difference in enrichment from control expressed as Δδ represents the change in labeled substrate oxidation.

Lactate 13C labeling was observed only when glucose tracer was used and was absent when the butyrate tracer was used. These findings indicate that 13C in butyrate is not incorporated into pyruvate through gluconeogenesis in HT29 or MIA cells. The results of lactate isotopomer production from [1,2-13C2]glucose are shown in Fig. 6. In addition to m2 lactate ([2,3-13C2]lactate), a significant fraction of singly labeled lactate was detected. Because recycling of label via the tricarboxylic acid cycle has been ruled out by the lack of labeling from butyrate, the slight increase in m1 in HT29 cells indicates an increase of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. The relative amount of glucose that is converted indirectly to lactate through the pentose cycle as a percentage of the glycolytic flux can be calculated from the m1/m2 ratio. The pentose cycle in HT29 cells was about twice that of the MIA cells. A dose-dependent increase in the pentose cycle was observed in HT29 cells treated with butyrate. No such effect was observed in MIA cells.Fig. 6Lactate isotopomers from [1,2-13C2]glucose. This is a graphical representation of the distribution of the different isotopomers of lactate obtained from the glucose label. The pentose cycle activity is defined as a percentage of the glycolytic flux calculated from m1/m2.

The average number of 13C atoms/molecule was reduced by 40% after 5 mm butyrate treatment. The reduction in ribose synthesis was much more modest (a reduction of about 15%) in MIA cells. Because butyrate treatment stimulates the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (lactate isotopomer data in Fig. 6), the reduction of ribose synthesis in HT29 cells was caused by reduced substrate flux through the non-oxidative steps of the pentose cycle. The reduced transketolase activity is evident in the decreased m2 ribose fraction in the HT29 cells. In contrast, the effect of butyrate treatment on MIA cells ribose synthesis was much less than that observed in HT29 cells.Fig. 7Effect of butyrate on RNA ribose synthesis. Ribose isotopomers obtained from the experiment with glucose label are shown. The m2 isotopomers of ribose are indicative of the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway flux, whereas the m1 isotopomers indicate the oxidative combined with the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway flux producing ribose. ∑mn represents the molar enrichment of 13C in ribose for each condition and each cell line and is indicative of the ribose that is synthesized. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe results of this study demonstrate that HT29 colon adenocarcinoma cells exhibit profound metabolic adaptive changes in connection with phenotype modification and differentiation in response to butyrate. Colon HT29 cells responded to increasing doses of butyrate by expressing alkaline phosphatase, a potent cell differentiation marker. This is in good agreement with the increasing expression of several differentiation markers in HT29 cells reported in the literature (21Augeron C. Laboisse C.L. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar). As determined from the metabolic profile, increasing concentrations of butyrate inhibited glucose uptake, glucose oxidation, and nucleic acid ribose synthesis in HT29 cells. In contradiction to these changes, there was a dose-dependent increase in de novo fatty acid synthesis utilizing butyrate carbons, whereas the utilization of glucose carbons for this purpose was diminished. There was also a significant increase in pentose cycle activity, affecting primarily the oxidative branch, which indicates an increase of NADPH production that is necessary for the increased fatty acid synthesis profile reported herein (Fig. 8). MIA cells, on the other hand, did not differentiate in response to butyrate, and the metabolic profile of MIA cells remained essentially unaffected. In contrast to HT29 cells, butyrate did not reduce glucose utilization, lactate production, or ribose synthesis in MIA cells.Fig. 8Metabolic profile changes associated with butyrate-induced differentiation. Colon cells normally utilize butyrate as the major fuel substrate. In malignant transformation, these cells acquire the ability to utilize glucose as the major substrate. When HT29 cells, a colon cancer cell line, are exposed to high concentration of butyrate, butyrate induces HT29 cells to differentiate back to their butyrate-utilizing phenotype. These metabolic profile changes in HT29 cells between these two metabolic phenotypes are shown. In the figure, the intensity of the arrows represents the magnitude of substrate flux. In the gray box, we have listed some of the major genetic changes accompanying butyrate utilization by these cells (13Della Ragione F. Criniti V. Della Pietra V. Borriello A. Oliva A. Indaco S.

HT29 cells originate from colon epithelial cells, which have the physiological role of metabolizing butyrate to prevent it from reaching toxic levels in the circulation. The transformation of colon epithelia into malignant HT29 cells requires prompt adaptation to a different nutrient environment in the absence of butyrate. The metabolic profile under such nutrient condition is similar to that of cultured MIA cells. However, when HT29 cells are exposed to butyrate, these cells re-adapt to a high butyrate nutrient condition, altering the expression of"
https://openalex.org/W2068071921,"Muc4/Sialomucin complex (SMC) acts as an intramembrane ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2, inducing a limited phosphorylation of the receptor. Because Muc4/SMC is found at the apical surfaces of polarized epithelial cells and ErbB2 is often basolateral, the question arises as to whether these components become associated in polarized cells. To address this question, we examined the localization of these proteins in polarized human colon carcinoma CACO-2 cells. Dual color immunofluorescence analysis by confocal microscopy demonstrated the basolateral localization of the ErbB2 in these cells; it is primarily co-localized with E-cadherin at adherens junctions. Expression of apical Muc4/SMC in these cells by transient transfection results in the localization of the ErbB2 at the apical surface. Twocolor confocal microscopy indicated that ErbB2 is colocalized with Muc4/SMC in the transfected cells but not in untransfected cells in the same culture. The change of localization of ErbB2 was confirmed by cell surface biotinylation of apical and basolateral proteins, followed by streptavidin precipitation and the subsequent detection of ErbB2 by immunoblotting. In contrast, Na+/K+-ATPase maintains its basolateral localization in Muc4/SMC-transfected cells, indicating that the translocation of ErbB2 is not the result of depolarization of the cells. A potential physiological role for the apical localization of ErbB2 is indicated by the fact that ErbB2 phosphorylated at tyrosine 1248 is found predominantly in Muc4/SMC-transfected cells, but not in untransfected cells, and is co-localized with the apical Muc4/SMC.

ErbB2 is a 185-kDa class I receptor tyrosine kinase that is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR. 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; SMC, sialomucin complex; ASGP, ascites sialoglycoprotein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; SMC, sialomucin complex; ASGP, ascites sialoglycoprotein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. The EGFR (ErbB) family includes four distinct members, i.e. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, HER1, or c-ErbB1), c-ErbB2 (HER2, p185neu), c-ErbB3 (HER3), and c-ErbB4 (HER4) (1Riese II, D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Binding of a specific ligand to one of the ErbB receptors triggers the formation of specific homo and heterodimers (2Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). This dimerization is followed by phosphorylation at one or more of several possible tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domains, which provide specific binding sites for cytoplasmic signaling proteins that, in turn, initiate downstream signaling (3Alroy I Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The pathways activated may lead the cell to proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis (1Riese II, D.J. Stern D.F.

ErbB2 is the preferred signaling partner and a crucial component of active receptor heterodimers (1Riese II, D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). These interactions have been implicated in numerous developmental processes in normal tissues such as the heart, brain, and mammary gland (3Alroy I Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) as well as in cancers of the breast, ovary, colon, kidney, bladder, stomach, and salivary gland, wherein ErbB2 is aberrantly expressed and is regarded as a major contributor to tumor progression (3Alroy I Yarden Y.

Because no high affinity soluble ligand has been reported to bind it directly, ErbB2 is thought to increase signaling through the ErbB receptor network by acting as a co-receptor (6Riese II, D.J. van Raaij T.M. Plowman G.D. Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5770-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 7Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). This model may not be complete, however, because it does not account for some observations on ErbB2 signaling. For example, neuregulin binds ErbB3 to induce its heterodimerization with ErbB2 and trigger ErbB3 phosphorylation (8Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A.

Thus, ErbB2 mechanisms of activation appear to be complex and may include factors capable of influencing availability and phosphorylation, which, in turn, could determine strength or specificity of signaling (10Crovello C.S. Carraway III, K.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have recently discovered a novel mechanism for activation and modulation of ErbB2 phosphorylation and signaling (11Carraway III, K.L. Rossi E.A. Komatsu M. Price-Shiavi S.A. Huang D. Carvajal M.E.

This mechanism involves Muc4/SMC, a cell surface heterodimeric glycoprotein. Muc4/SMC is composed of two noncovalently associated subunits, ASGP-1 and ASGP-2, which arise from proteolytic processing of a single gene product (12Sheng Z. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mucin subunit ASGP-1 (∼600 kDa) endows the molecule with anti-adhesive properties and contributes to the ability to evade immune recognition (13Komatsu M. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2229-2236PubMed Google Scholar). Subunit ASGP-2 (∼120kDa) tethers the complex to the cell surface and serves as an intramembrane ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 via an epidermal growth factor-like domain (11Carraway III, K.L. Rossi E.A. Komatsu M. Price-Shiavi S.A. Huang D. Carvajal M.E. Guy P.M. Fregien N. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway K.L. J. Biol.

This interaction induces phosphorylation of ErbB2 in the absence of a soluble ligand and potentiates the phosphorylation of the ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimer in the presence of the ErbB3-soluble ligand neuregulin. The Muc4/SMC-ErbB2 complex was first observed in highly metastatic rat ascites 13762 mammary adenocarcinoma cells, wherein the receptor and several of its associated intracellular signaling proteins appeared constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated (15Carraway C.A.C. Carvajal M.E. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25659-25667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The Muc4/SMC-ErbB2 interaction has been demonstrated in several systems, including normal lactating mammary gland, ascites tumors, isolated rat mammary epithelial cells, Muc4/SMC-transfected MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and a baculovirus-insect cell expression system (16Carraway K.L. Perez A. Idris N. Jepson S. Arango M. Komatsu M. Haq B. Price-Schiavi S.A. Zhang J. Carraway C.A.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 149-185Google Scholar). Muc4/SMC is constitutively expressed in many epithelial tissues wherein it is apically located and serves mainly a protective function (16Carraway K.L. Perez A. Idris N. Jepson S. Arango M. Komatsu M. Haq B. Price-Schiavi S.A. Zhang J. Carraway C.A.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 149-185Google Scholar). Its expression is tightly regulated in the mammary gland and the female reproductive tract (17Price-Schiavi S.A. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35228-35237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Idris N. Carraway K.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and its expression at specific times during epithelial differentiation in certain organs suggests a role in developmental processes (16Carraway K.L. Perez A. Idris N. Jepson S. Arango M. Komatsu M. Haq B. Price-Schiavi S.A. Zhang J. Carraway C.A.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 149-185Google Scholar). In some carcinomas, the regulatory mechanisms have been suppressed, and Muc4/SMC is highly over-expressed (16Carraway K.L. Perez A. Idris N. Jepson S. Arango M. Komatsu M. Haq B. Price-Schiavi S.A. Zhang J. Carraway C.A.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 149-185Google Scholar). One question of importance to forming a Muc4/SMC-ErbB2 complex concerns the localization of the molecules. Muc4/SMC is localized apically in polarized epithelial cells, whereas ErbB2 is often considered to be a basolateral protein (19Borg J.P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 20Dillon C. Creer A. Kerr K. Kumin A. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6553-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, we have recently demonstrated both apical and basolateral localizations of ErbB2, even in the same epithelium (21Idris N. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway K.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). From these results we have suggested that Muc4/SMC may contribute to determining the localization of ErbB2 and, thus, its signaling capabilities in polarized epithelia. To address this question, we examined the localization of these proteins in polarized human colon carcinoma CACO-2 cells. When grown in culture, these epithelial cells form polarized monolayers that establish a barrier to the passage of most small molecules and ions. The extracellular spaces are sealed by tight junctions, whose structural integrity is essential to the functional integrity of the tissue. A specific contributor to this structural integrity is E-cadherin, a transmembrane cell-cell adhesion protein located at the lateral junctions and usually concentrated in adhesion belts just below the tight junctions, which connect to the actin cytoskeleton of the cells (22Geiger B. Ayalon O. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 307-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate in CACO-2 cells that ErbB2 is localized to the lateral membrane, which is primarily co-localized with cadherin. However, when Muc4/SMC is expressed in these cells, the ErbB2 is translocated to the apical domain. Cell Culture—CACO-2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). They were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. The cell stocks were kept in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks and collected after dissociation with 0.25% trypsin and 2 mm EDTA for 15 min. For immunofluorescence experiments, the cells were plated on 12-mm round coverslips (Fisher Scientific) or 6-mm Transwell-Clear™ filters (Corning Costar) at high density (≈5 × 104 cells/cm2) in order to obtain confluency in 2–3 days. For biotinylation experiments the cells were plated on 24-mm Transwell-Clear ™ filters (Corning Costar). Transient Transfections—Forty-eight hours prior to immunofluorescence or biotinylation experiments, CACO-2 cells (70% confluent) were transiently transfected with Muc4/SMC using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each experiment, plates of CACO-2 cells were prepared; half of them were transfected, and the other half were untransfected. Antibodies and Reagents—The primary antibodies used in this study were against the following antigens: Muc4, ErbB2, E-cadherin, and Na+/K+-ATPase. Monoclonal antibody 4F12, which was developed in our laboratory, was used to detect Muc4 (27Rossi E.A. McNeer R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Komatsu M. Van den Brande J.M.H. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33476-33485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This antibody was also used in its biotinylated form. To study ErbB2, we used four monoclonal antibodies from Lab Vision (Fremont, CA), namely NeoMarkers 2 (clone 9G6.10) and NeoMarkers 10 (clone L87 + e2–4001), which react against the extracellular domain of ErbB2, NeoMarkers 17 (clone e2–4001 + 3B5), and NeoMarkers 1, which reacts against the phosphorylated tyrosine at position 1248. The polyclonal antibody against ErbB2 from DakoCytomation (Carpinteria, CA) was also used. E-cadherin was studied with the following monoclonal antibodies from Transcription Laboratories and BD Biosciences: E-cadherin antibody clone 34, E-cadherin antibody clone 36, and the FITC-conjugated E-cadherin antibody. The Na+/K+-ATPase was detected with a monoclonal antibody against this protein from Upstate Laboratories (clone c464.6) and an antibody kindly provided by Dr. W. James Nelson. All secondary antibodies were affinity-purified and did not cross-react with immunoglobulins of species other than their specific target. Absence of cross-reactivity was determined by agar diffusion assay before co-localization experiments. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Pierce and Sigma-Aldrich. Alexa Fluor® 488 and Texas Red®-conjugated secondary antibodies were used as specified by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Immunofluorescence—CACO-2 cells grown to confluence on 12-mm round coverslips (Fisher Scientific) or 6-mm Transwell-Clear ™ filters (Corning Costar) were processed for immunofluorescence studies 48 h after transient transfection with Muc4/SMC. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After rinsing, the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X100 for 5 min or 0.1% saponin throughout the procedure. Permeabilization was used in all cases except with anti-ErbB2 NeoMarkers 2 (LabVision, Fremont, CA). The permeabilization was followed by rinsing and quenching of the aldehyde groups in 50 mm NH4Cl, after which the cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibody was diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin; in co-localization experiments, 0.1% immunoglobulin G of the same species as the secondary antibody was used instead of 1% bovine serum albumin for rinsing steps and dilution of the primary antibody. Once this first incubation was completed, the cells were rinsed and then incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated to the fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor® 488 or Texas Red® from Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The cells were then mounted in 10% polyvinyl alcohol, 30% glycerol, 1% n-propyl gallate, and Slow Fade ™ (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 5:1. The preparations were first observed in a Leitz DM RB microscope (Leica Instruments GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a Leica Orthomat E microphotography system using a 63× (1.4 NA) infinity-corrected objective. Laser confocal microscopy was performed with an LSM 510 microscope from Zeiss (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Germany) equipped with two laser sources and the option of up to three channels. Cell monolayers stained with FITC, Alexa Fluor® 488, and Texas Red® were analyzed using a 63× oil immersion objective. The images were collected using the LSM 510 software (Carl Zeiss, GmbH, Germany), and each confocal section was obtained as the average of four frames. Polarity Assays—Cell monolayers grown to confluency on 24-mm Transwell-Clear ™ filters (Corning Costar) were biotinylated on the apical or basolateral surfaces 48 h after transient transfection with Muc4/SMC. After rinsing, the surface proteins of the cells were biotinylated at 4 °C using a cell membrane-impermeable biotin derivative, sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce). For proteins on the apical surface, the monolayer was exposed to the biotinylation agent for 15 min; for the basolateral surface, it was exposed for 40 min. After standard rinsing and quenching of the aldehyde groups in 50 mm NH4Cl, the cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF). The cells were gently scraped from the filter with a rubber policeman, sonicated on ice for 30 s, and centrifuged at 15000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Biotinylated proteins were affinity purified in batch mode overnight at 4 °C with streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads (Pierce). The biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads by 1 mm Tris and 2% SDS and subjected subsequently to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. After rinsing the pellet with acetone, it was resuspended in 1 mm Tris buffer, pH 7. PAGE and Immunoblot—The preparations of biotinylated proteins were obtained as described above. Unbiotinylated CACO-2 cell preparations used as negative or positive controls for primary antibodies were processed in the same way minus the biotinylation steps. The samples were run in SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto nitrocellulose sheets (27Rossi E.A. McNeer R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Komatsu M. Van den Brande J.M.H. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33476-33485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The signal of primary monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies was detected using secondary affinity-purified goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulins coupled to peroxidase and a chemiluminescent system (Pierce) and exposed on x-ray film (Kodak). The intensity of the bands was estimated by digitizing the image (Scion Image) from x-ray film. After subtracting the background, all band intensities were compared against a control. ErbB2 Is Co-localized with Cadherin, a Lateral Junctional Protein—CACO-2 epithelial cells express ErbB2 at a level detectable by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1). To determine the localization of ErbB2 in these cells, monolayers of the CACO-2 cells were stained with different antibodies for ErbB2 (21Idris N. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway K.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy suggested that the ErbB2 was located primarily in the lateral surfaces of these cells. To verify this localization, we co-stained cells with anti-ErbB2 NeoMarkers 2 monoclonal antibody (Lab Vision), followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to Texas Red® and the anti-cadherin FITC-conjugated antibody from BD Biosciences. As shown in the two-color merged confocal images in the x-y and x-z planes in Fig. 1, ErbB2 and cadherin are substantially co-localized (Fig. 1, A and B). This observation was confirmed by repeating the same immunofluorescence experiment using a different set of antibodies, i.e. the polyclonal anti-ErbB2 from DakoCytomation and a monoclonal antibody against cadherin from Transduction Laboratories (data not shown). These observations are consistent with previous studies showing localization of ErbB2 at intercellular junctions of epithelial cells (23Geiger B. Ayalon O. Ginsberg D. Volberg T. Rodriguez Fernandez J.L. Yarden Y. Ben-Ze'ev A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Muc4 Translocates ErbB2 to the Apical Surface Where It Is Co-localized with Muc4 —Immunoblotting (Fig. 2A) and immunofluorescence (data not shown) assays on CACO-2 cells indicate undetectable endogenous expression of Muc4/SMC under the conditions specified in this study. To investigate the ability of Muc4/SMC to translocate ErbB2 from the basolateral membrane to the apical surface, we transiently transfected the CACO-2 cells with Muc4/SMC. Transient transfection allowed us to observe transfected cells in a population of untransfected cells (Fig. 2). Cells transfected with Muc4/SMC show co-localization of ErbB2 with the Muc4/SMC in two-color confocal merged images (Fig. 2, B and C); the translocation to the apical surface is particularly dramatic in the x-z plane (Fig. 2C, arrow). The surrounding untransfected cells do not show the re-localization of ErbB2 (Fig. 2, B and C). The apical localization of the ErbB2 is also observed by staining the cells with a monoclonal anti-ErbB2 antibody against the ErbB2 extracellular domain added to the apical side of the cell layers (Fig. 3). This antibody stains basolateral ErbB2 in permeabilized layers of untransfected CACO-2 cells but fails to stain nonpermeabilized, untransfected cell layers (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the antibody heavily stains the cell surfaces from the apical side of the Muc4/SMC-transfected cells in the cell layers but not the untransfected cells in the culture (Fig. 3B; compare the distributions of staining of ErbB2 and Muc4 with the cells observed by phase contrast).Fig. 3Detection of apical ErbB2 by extracellular domain antibody in Muc4/SMC-transfected cells. A, untransfected permeabilized and nonpermeabilized CACO-2 monolayers were processed for immunofluorescence with the monoclonal antibody NeoMarkers 2 against the extracellular domain of c-ErbB2 (red channel). Confocal sections are shown with the apical side up. Note the absence of ErbB2 staining in the nonpermeabilized cells at the apical surface. Bar, 10 μm. B, nonpermeabilized Muc4/SMC transiently transfected CACO-2 monolayers were processed for immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibody NeoMarkers 2 against the extracellular domain of c-ErbB2 (red channel) and 4F12 monoclonal anti-Muc4/SMC (green channel). Confocal sections are shown with the apical side up. Note staining of nonpermeabilized Muc4/SMC-transfected, but not untransfected, cells with anti-ErbB2 from the apical side.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The location of ErbB2 was further addressed by biotinylation experiments (Fig. 5). CACO-2 cell layers were treated with a nonpermeable biotinylating reagent from either the apical or basolateral side. The cells were then solubilized for affinity purification of the biotinylated cell surface proteins with streptavidin-conjugated agarose. Immunoblotting of the streptavidin precipitates with anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody NeoMarkers 17 (Lab Vision) demonstrated the surface to which the ErbB2 was exposed. This antibody was selected for its specificity and low background after trials with monoclonal antibodies 2, 8, and 10 from NeoMarkers and the polyclonal antibody from DakoCytomation. A cell lysate of A375 human melanoma cells known to express ErbB2 was run as a positive control to confirm reactivity of the antibodies. As a negative control, unbiotinylated CACO-2 cells were processed in the same manner as biotinylated cells. As shown in Fig. 4, ErbB2 is present at the apical surface in the cells transfected with Muc4/SMC but absent in untransfected cells. In contrast, as expected for transiently transfected cells, ErbB2 is present at the basolateral surfaces in both transfected and untransfected cells.Fig. 4Detection of apical ErbB2 by extracellular biotinylation in Muc4/SMC-transfected cells. Immunoblot analyses were performed on precipitates of biotinylated proteins from the apical or the basolateral surfaces of CACO-2 cells using anti-ErbB2 NeoMarkers 17 and anti-Na+/K+-ATPase. The double band displayed for ErbB2 in the untransfected cells has been observed in Caco-2 and other cell lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One trivial explanation for these results is that transfection with Muc4/SMC results in a loss of cell polarization. To address this possibility, Na+/K+-ATPase, a basolateral marker, was examined by biotinylation from the apical and the basolateral surfaces. As shown in Fig. 4, no Na+/K+-ATPase was detected at the apical surfaces of either transfected or untransfected cells, but it was readily detected at the basolateral surfaces of both, indicating that loss of cell polarity has not occurred. Phosphorylated ErbB2 Is Detected Predominantly in Muc4/SMC-transfected Cells—Our previous studies have shown that Muc4/SMC binding to ErbB2 leads to phosphorylation of the ErbB2 on tyrosine 1248, detected by a specific anti-phospho-ErbB2. To determine whether ErbB2 in the transfected CACO-2 is in the phosphorylated form, Muc4/SMC-transfected cells as well as untransfected cells were probed with a monoclonal antibody against ErbB2 phosphorylated at position 1248. The signal from this antibody was observed predominantly in cells transfected with Muc4/SMC, compared with untransfected cells, which showed no signal (Fig. 5). Analysis of the slices of the z-stacks of transfected and untransfected cells indicate that phosphorylated ErbB2 is substantially co-localized with Muc4 at the apical membrane in the transfected cells (Fig. 5, merge). These results confirm our previous studies, which indicate that formation of the Muc4/SMC-ErbB2 complex leads to specific phosphorylation of the ErbB2 (26Jepson S. Komatsu M. Haq B. Arango M.E. Huang D. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway K.L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7524-7532Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). ErbB2 Localization in Muc4/SMC-expressing Epithelia— One question that arises concerning the ability of Muc4/SMC to affect ErbB2 localization is its generality. We have examined a number of epithelia expressing Muc4/SMC to determine the localization of ErbB2. The general picture is that ErbB2 is apically localized, although not exclusively, in simple epithelia in which Muc4/SMC is present in its membrane form and is apical. Examples include the mammary gland, uterus, and oviduct (Table I). An unusual exception is the lacrimal gland (Table I), wherein the membrane Muc4/SMC is not predominantly apical as it is in other simple epithelia. However, ErbB2 is co-localized with the membrane Muc4/SMC but not with a soluble form of Muc4/SMC present in secretory granules (28Arango M.E. Li P. Komatsu M. Montes C. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway K.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2749-2756xPubMed Google Scholar). A second exception is the colon (Table I), in which Muc4/SMC is predominantly in a soluble form in secretion granules in goblet cells (27Rossi E.A. McNeer R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Komatsu M. Van den Brande J.M.H. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33476-33485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Finally, stratified epithelia provide an obvious exception, because Muc4/SMC and ErbB2 will not necessarily be expressed in the same cells in these complex epithelia.Table IErbB2 localization in Muc4/SMC-expressing epitheliaTissueaNumbers in parentheses are references.Muc4 (membrane/soluble)ErbB2 localizationCo-localization/methodMammarybS.

Open table in a new tab Cell signaling mechanisms depend not only on the components of signaling pathways but also on their localization within the cell (24Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ErbB receptors are usually considered to be basolateral components of epithelial cells, because their soluble ligands are produced by stromal cells or come through the blood stream and, thus, are accessible to basolateral surfaces. Signaling through heterodimerization mechanisms requires that both ErbBs destined to form a heterodimer are accessible to each other. Because ErbB2 is the key element in most heterodimerization schemes (1Riese II, D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 2Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C.

However, the localization of ErbB2 in polarized epithelia is far from clear. Both basolateral (19Borg J.P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J.

Recent studies have presented conflicting pictures, implicating the PDZ domain-containing protein ERBIN (19Borg J.P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and specific ErbB2 juxtamembrane sequences (20Dillon C. Creer A. Kerr K. Kumin A. Dickson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6553-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, regardless of which of these is correct in cells not expressing Muc4/SMC, our results suggest that the mucin can override these mechanisms and direct ErbB2 to the apical surface, as shown in the model in Fig. 6A. How Muc4/SMC is able to change the ErbB2 localization is yet unclear, though there are two likely possibilities. Our previous results have indicated that Muc4/SMC forms an intracellular complex with ErbB2 and that complex formation leads to phosphorylation of Tyr-1248 of the ErbB2 (11Carraway III, K.L.

The present studies indicate that this phosphorylated form occurs in the Muc4/SMC-transfected cells, but not in untransfected cells, and is co-localized with the Muc4/SMC. Phosphorylation could block the interaction of ErbB2 with factors directing it to the basolateral membrane, as shown for ERBIN (19Borg J.P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F.

Alternatively, Muc4/SMC could “drag” ErbB2 to the apical surface by overriding its basolateral signals. Preliminary studies on the formation of the Muc4/SMC-ErbB2 complex in the baculovirus expression system indicate that it is formed very early, before reaching the cell surface. Regardless of the mechanism involved, localization of ErbB2 to the apical surface of polarized cells has important implications for cell behavior. Apical localization will sequester the ErbB2 from ligands with only basolateral access and possibly from other ErbBs. Such localization may also restrict the intracellular pathways to which ErbB2 can contribute. Removing ErbB2 from junctional complexes will limit its ability to phosphorylate junctional components and disrupt cell-cell adhesion mechanisms. To the contrary, overexpression of ErbB2 may override the Muc4/SMC localization mechanism, increase ErbB2 association with cell junctions, and facilitate their disruption by neoplastic transformation. One interesting possibility for the function of the Muc4/SMC localization of ErbB2 is that apical ErbB2 provides a sensor of epithelial cell integrity. Loss of polarization would expose the ErbB2 to basolateral components, potentially activating additional signaling pathways that could stimulate responses necessary for initiating repair mechanisms. This loss could occur as a result of epithelial damage that destroyed cell-cell interactions and caused the cells to become rounded. We have shown previously that neuregulin stimulation of cells containing the Muc4/SMC-ErbB2 complex leads to potentiation of the phosphorylation of both ErbB2 and ErbB3, presumably from the formation of a Muc4/SMC-ErbB2-ErbB3-neuregulin “quad” complex. The hyperphosphorylation of these receptors should lead to initiation and/or activation of additional downstream signaling pathways. Thus, loss of cell polarization due to injury could convert the epithelial cells from a differentiated state, with Muc4/SMC-ErbB2 at the apical surface, to a proliferative state, with the Muc4/SMC-ErbB2-ErbB3-neuregulin quad complex distributed around the cell surface (Fig. 6B). Based on this model, we propose that ErbB2 acts as a regulatory switch in epithelial cells between differentiation and proliferation, with Muc4/SMC acting as a modulator of that switch. Switching to the proliferative state will position the epithelial cells to begin processes necessary to repair the damage. Similarly, loss of polarization can occur as a consequence of neoplastic transformation. Thus, we envision that tumor cells simply highjack the epithelial sensor/repair mechanism to promote proliferation and progression. We thank Dr. W.

Regulation of caspase-8 expression on a post-translational level has been studied in detail, whereas only little information is available on its control by gene transcription. We identified and cloned the human caspase-8 promoter, determined the transcriptional start site of the caspase-8 gene, and examined the regulatory mechanisms of the promoter with respect to its basal activity as well as to its inducibility upon apoptotic stimuli in human hepatoma cells. We identified two minimal sequences essential for basal transcription of caspase-8 and demonstrate that a single SP1 and an ETS-like binding motif mediate this effect. We further show that the caspase-8 promoter is inducible and demonstrate that adenoviral infection increases caspase-8 mRNA levels. However, the increase in caspase-8 gene transcription after adenoviral infection absolutely depends on the p53 status of the hepatoma cell line, implying that caspase-8 is a target gene of p53. We show that delivery of exogenous p53 alone is sufficient to induce the caspase-8 promoter even in p53-deficient Hep3B hepatoma cells. Subsequent promoter deletion analysis in combination with luciferase reporter assays identified a p53-responsive element downstream of the transcriptional start site. We demonstrate that this p53-responsive sequence overlaps with the ETS-like binding site and suggest that an additional p53-inducible, yet unknown factor interacts with this region of the caspase-8 promoter. In summary, our study contributes to the understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the caspase-8 gene by basal (SP1- and ETS-dependent) and inducible (p53-dependent) mechanisms.

Caspase-8 is highly regulated on a posttranslational level. Upon apoptotic stimulation and subsequent death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation, an unprocessed procaspase-8 is coupled to the adapter molecule Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) via two death effector domains, which is a prerequisite for processing of procaspase-8 to the active caspase by proteolytic cleavage leading to the active subunits p18 and p10 (2Medema J.P.

These subunits are released to the cytosol and mediate caspase activity via a C-terminal protease domain. Caspase-8-dependent apoptosis can be modulated by expression of c-FLIP, a molecule sharing homology to caspase-8 but lacking a functional protease domain (4Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H.

For downstream signaling of caspase-8 leading to apoptosis two different pathways have been described (5Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar), one via activation of Bid involving mitochondria and cytochrome c release and the other via direct activation of effector caspases as caspase-3. Details of apoptosis signaling and caspase-8 activation are reviewed in detail elsewhere (6Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At present, the transcriptional regulation of the caspase-8 gene has not been examined in detail. However, it has been demonstrated in vitro that ectopic overexpression of caspase-8 is sufficient to induce apoptosis (3Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J.

This implies that a self-processing mechanism might be activated if a critical threshold of pro-caspase-8 is expressed. In addition it has been shown that in certain childhood neuroblastomas and neuroectodermal brain tumors as well as in some types of lung cancers, caspase-8 expression is rather low or even abolished, which was explained by both somatic gene mutations and deletions as well as silencing due to hypermethylation of genomic caspase-8 sequences (8Takita J.

The aim of this study was to examine the regulation of the caspase-8 promoter. Because acute liver failure and viral hepatitis are often associated with Fas/TNF-dependent apoptotic mechanisms (12Kanzler S. Galle P.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we focused our analysis on the transcriptional mechanisms that are involved in controlling caspase-8 expression in hepatoma cells. Plasmids and Recombinant DNA Techniques—Standard recombinant DNA techniques were carried out as described elsewhere (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Habor, NY1989Google Scholar). For intermediate cloning steps the vectors pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) and pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) were used. For construction of luciferase-reporter plasmids we amplified appropriate genomic fragments of the caspase-8 promoter using a PCR approach and oligonucleotides that are flanked by KpnI and HindIII restriction sites. The resulting fragments were then cloned into the KpnI and HindIII sites of the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega). As the template for the amplification of the caspase-8 promoter we used male human genomic DNA (Promega). Promoter sequences amplified by PCR were confirmed by sequencing using an ABI Prism 310 (Applied Biosystems). Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides used in this study were purchased from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). For amplification of genomic promoter fragments and for primer extension analysis we designed oligonucleotides of 20–30 bp in length and a GC content of ∼50%. Primer sequences for amplifying promoter fragments are as follows (only the distal base position is given; restriction sites are indicated in bold): +76 (antisense), 5′-AAGCTTGTACAGGCAGGCAGGAAGCTC-3′; +76mutETS (antisense), 5′-AAGCTTGTACAGGCAGGCAGAAAGCT-3′; +66 (antisense), 5′-AAGCTTGCAGGAAGCTCAGTCTGAAC-3′; +58 (antisense). 5′-AAGCTTCTCAGTCTGAACAACCAGCC-3′; +48 (antisense), 5′-AAGCTTACAACCAGCCTTCAGACCAG-3′; –972 (sense), 5′-GGTACCGTCACCAAAGAGAACAGAGTG-3′; –470 (sense), 5′-GGTACCGTCACTATGCTTCCTGTACAGC-3′; –370 (sense), 5′-GGTACCGATGAGCTGATACAGTTTCC-3′; –307 (sense), 5′-GGTACCCAGATTGCTTAGTAATTAAAACGC-3′; –171 (sense), 5′-GGTACCAAACGACAACTCACAGTGCC-3′; –121 (sense), 5′-GGTACCGTGGAGAATGGGAGCACTCTCCGC-3′; –111 (sense), 5′-GGTACCGGAGCACTCTCCGCAGTGGG-3′; –101 (sense), 5′-GGTACCCCGCAGTGGGCGGGAGGAGACG-3′; –101SP1mut (sense) 5′-GGTACCCCGCAGTGTTCGGGAGGAGACGAG-3′; –91 (sense), 5′-GGTACCCGGGAGGAGACGAGGAGGGCG-3′; –81 (sense): 5′-GGTACCCGAGGAGGGCGTTCCCTGGGGAG-3′; –71 (sense), 5′-GGTACCGTTCCCTGGGGAGTGGCAGTGGTTGG-3′; +34 (antisense), 5′-AAGCTTCAGACCAGCTCAGACACAAGGTGAAAC-3′; –24 (antisense), 5′-AAGCTTTTACCTCCTCCAAACCTTTGC-3′; –99 (antisense), 5′-AAGCTTGGAGAGTGCTCCCATTCTCC-3′. PCR and Duplex RT-PCR of Human Caspase-8/GAPDH—RNA was isolated using a RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed according to standard procedures using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) with 5′-3′ proofreading activity for exact amplification of the promoter fragments. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles with denaturing at 92 °C for 15 s, an amplification step of 1 min/kilobase at 68 °C, and a final extension step at 68 °C for 7 min. For RT-PCR we performed first-strand synthesis using Oligo(dT)15 primer (Promega) and the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen) in combination with 1 μg of total RNA per reaction. Amplification of caspase-8 and GAPDH cDNA were carried out in one reaction using the following primers: caspase-8 (sense), 5′-CTTGGATGCAGGGGCTTTGACC-3′; caspase-8 (antisense), 5′-GTTCACTTCAGTCAGGATGG-3′; GAPDH (sense), 5′-TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAG-3′; GAPDH (antisense), 5′-TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGCCAT-3′. PCR was performed for 10 cycles with first-strand DNA and caspase-8 primers at a T anneal of 53 °C. Then the reaction was interrupted, primers for GAPDH were added, and the reaction was continued for another 25 cycles. PCR products were documented and quantitated using a Gel Doc 1000 apparatus (Bio-Rad) and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). For direct comparison, the GAPDH/caspase-8 ratio was determined. Cell Culture, Transfection Experiments, and Luciferase Assays— HepG2, HuH7, and Hep3B hepatoma cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and differ with respect to their p53 status as described in Muller et al. (14Muller M. Wilder S. Bannasch D. Israeli D. Lehlbach K. Li-Weber M. Friedman S.L. Galle P.R. Stremmel W. Oren M. Krammer P.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. DNA transfection was performed using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (15Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown on 60-mm dishes to ∼50% confluence when used for transfection experiments. In general, 2.5 μg of reporter plasmid were used for transfection. All transfections contained 0.5 μg of the β-galactosidase reporter pCMV-Gal as an internal standard. By adding pBSK+ DNA (Stratagene) to a total of 5 μg of DNA to the transfection mix, the total amount of DNA was kept constant in each transfection experiment. To measure luciferase activity, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by adding 350 μl of extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-H3PO4, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) for 10 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation. 50 μl of the supernatant were assayed by adding 300 μl of measuring buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm ATP). The light emission was measured in duplicate for 10 s in a Lumat LB 9501 (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) by injecting 100 μl of 250 μm luciferin. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. The data were compared with appropriate controls, calculated as relative luciferase activity, and represent the average of three independent experiments. Adenoviral Vectors Used in This Study and Infection of Hepatoma Cells—Recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying GFP (adv-GFP) and p53 (adv-p53) were kindly provided by Dr. B. Mundt and Dr. L. Zender (Hannover, Germany) and have been described in Mundt et al. (16Mundt B. Kuhnel F. Zender L. Paul Y. Tillmann H. Trautwein C. Manns M.P. Kubicka S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and Zender et al. (17Zender L. Kock R. Eckhard M. Frericks B. Gosling T. Gebhardt T. Drobek S. Galanski M. Kuhnel F. Manns M. Kubicka S. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 608-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For adenoviral infection, hepatoma cells were seeded to a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Before infecting the cells at a multiplicity of infection of 50, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. Nuclear Extracts and Gel Retardation Assays—HepG2 and HuH7 nuclear extracts were prepared using the modified Dignam C method (18Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Malek N.P. Plumpe J. Tiegs G. Manns M.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1960-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For gel retardation assays, nuclear extracts were used as indicated. Binding buffer for SP1 EMSA consisted of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 34 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), and 2 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. As probes, 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides were used at an activity of 30000 cpm/μl. The oligonucleotides used for SP1 and ETS EMSA are shown under Results. The binding reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C. Free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Supershift experiments were performed with a specific SP1 antibody or an antibody directed against a broad range of ETS family members, respectively (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For p53- and ETS-specific EMSA experiments, respectively, modified protocols were used (19Kubicka S. Kuhnel F. Zender L. Rudolph K.L. Plumpe J. Manns M. Trautwein C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32137-32144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Kavurma M.M. Bobryshev Y. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36244-36252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Primer Extension Analysis—For mapping the transcriptional start site of the caspase-8 promoter we used the commercial available Primer Extension System (Promega) and performed primer extension analysis according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 10 pmol of the oligo 5′-TGGCGGGGTACAGGCAGGCAGGAAGCTC-3′ (compare Fig. 1A) as well as a DNA marker mix were end-labeled using 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 3000 Ci/mmol [γ-32P]ATP. The primer extension reaction was performed using 10 μg of total RNA from HepG2 or HuH7 cells and 0.2 pmol of labeled oligo. The reaction was analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8% acrylamide, 7 m urea in 1× Tris-buffered EDTA. After autoradiography overnight, the size of the primer extension product was determined by direct comparison to the provided DNA size marker. Computational Analysis—The human caspase-8 5′-untranslated region was identified by using the BLAST server (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar) at the NCBI and the human caspase-8 cDNA sequence (accession number NM 001228) as a query. For a prediction of putative binding sites for transcription factors we used the MatInspector professional software (Genomatix) as described in Quandt et al. (22Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). Cloning and Analysis of the 5′-Upstream Region of the Human Caspase-8 Gene—To isolate the human caspase-8 promoter we performed a BLAST search with the human genome using the longest isoform of the caspase-8 cDNA (variant A, accession number NM 001228). The 5′ sequence of the caspase-8 cDNA matched perfectly to a genomic sequence located on chromosome 2 (accession number NT 005403). This is in agreement with recent reports showing that the caspase-8 gene maps at chromosome 2 (band 2q33-q34) (23Grenet J. Teitz T. Wei T. Valentine V. Kidd V.J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 226: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Kischkel F.C. Kioschis P. Weitz S. Poustka A. Lichter P. Krammer P.H. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 82: 95-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we concluded that the 5′ upstream region of the match may contain the caspase-8 promoter. The sequence containing the putative caspase-8 promoter as well as the noncoding exons 1 and 2 was deposited to the GenBank™ data bank under accession number AY 291598 and is displayed in Fig. 1A. Performing an initial computer analysis of the promoter sequence using MatInspector software (22Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar), binding sites for transcription factors including NFκB, STAT1, SP1, and ETS were predicted and are shown in Fig. 1A. Next we were interested to map the transcriptional start site of the caspase-8 gene. For this experiment we used an antisense primer (see Fig. 1A, arrow) located within the noncoding exon 1. Primer extension analysis with total RNA isolated from both HepG2 and HuH7 cells revealed a 78-bp primer extension product (Fig. 1B, see lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Accordingly, we identified the sequence TTTCTG as the transcriptional start site of the caspase-8 gene. This site is located 29 bp upstream of the 5′ end of the published cDNA. The position of the transcriptional start site was arbitrarily set to +1. A Sequence Located between –121 and –71 Contributes to the Basal Activity of the Caspase-8 Promoter—For further experiments, we amplified an ∼1000-bp fragment containing the putative caspase-8 promoter region and a small part of the first, noncoding exon 1 using primers –972 and +76. The resulting fragment was cloned into the HindIII and KpnI sites of the pGL2 luciferase vector (Promega) and was termed –972/+76 with respect to the 5′ and 3′ positions related to the transcriptional start site. To map the core region of the caspase-8 promoter we first introduced 5′ deletions (Fig. 2A) in the –972/+76 construct using a PCR approach (respective primers are listed under “Experimental Procedures”). All constructs were transfected in HuH7 cells including the empty pGL2 vector as a control. Luciferase activity of the –972/+76 construct was nearly 300-fold increased compared with the pGL2 control, whereas the strongest activity was found with the –121/+76 construct (Fig. 2B). A further 5′ deletion of 50 bp (–71/+76 construct) resulted in a 8-fold reduction in luciferase activity, indicating that this region is involved in controlling basal caspase-8 promoter activity. Because our data suggested that the region located between bp –121 and –71 is essential for basal caspase-8 promoter activity, we further concentrated on the role of this sequence. We performed a detailed analysis of this area by introducing increasing 10-bp 5′ deletions in the –121/+76 construct (Fig. 2C). Transfection experiments in HuH7 cells using these constructs revealed that the region located between position –101 and –91 plays a major role for basal caspase-8 promoter activity (Fig. 2D). A Unique SP1 Binding Motif Is Essential for Basal Activity of the Caspase-8 Promoter—MatInspector software analysis identified a potential SP1 binding site between position –101 and –91 (Fig. 2C, underlined sequence). To confirm SP1 DNA binding to this motif, we next performed gel retardation analysis with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides representing the putative SP1 site found in the caspase-8 promoter and nuclear extracts isolated from HuH7 cells. A SP1 consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 3A) served as a control. Complex formation with the SP1 consensus oligonucleotide revealed three SP1-specific complexes, where only the upper slow-migrating complex could be supershifted by anti-SP1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Gel shift experiments using the putative SP1 binding site of the caspase-8 promoter (Fig. 3A) revealed complex formation comparable with the pattern found with the SP1 consensus oligonucleotide. The slower migrating complex also could be supershifted with an SP1 antibody. In contrast, introducing two G → T mutations within the core sequence of the putative SP1 binding motif (Fig. 3A) in the caspase-8 promoter abolished SP1-dependent complex formation (Fig 3B, lane 10). To further support our data, we performed competition experiments using the SP1 consensus motif as a 32P-labeled probe and competed for complex formation by using either the wt or the mutant putative binding site as derived from the caspase-8 promoter (Fig. 3A). A 5, 25, and 100 m excess of the respective cold oligonucleotide was used for competition analysis. When the wt sequence was used as competitor, a 5 m excess was already able to compete for binding of the three putative SP1-specific complexes (Fig. 3C, lane 3–5), whereas the mutant oligonucleotide was not able to inhibit formation of these specific complexes in the same molar range (lane 6–8). These data together with the transfection experiments indicated that SP1 is involved in controlling the basal activity of the caspase-8 promoter. To further support our findings, we introduced the mutated SP1 motif in the caspase-8 promoter of reporter-construct –101/+76, resulting in –101SP1mut/+76. Transfection experiments using the –101/+76, the –101/+76mut, and the –91/+76 caspase-8 construct and subsequent luciferase assays revealed a significant reduction (–60%) in promoter activity of the mutant compared with the respective wt construct (Fig. 3D). However, the activity of the –91/+76 caspase-8 construct was still lower compared with –101/+76mut. An ETS-like Element Is Located in the 3′ End of the Caspase-8 Promoter and Contributes to Basal Activity—To identify further elements involved in controlling basal caspase-8 promoter activity, we introduced several 3′ deletions in the –470/+76 construct and compared the respective luciferase activities after transfection into HuH7 cells. Luciferase activity completely dropped when the deletion contained the start site of transcription (Fig. 4, A and B, plasmid –470/–24 and –470/–99, respectively). Interestingly, a 3′ deletion of 28 bp in plasmid –470/+48 reduced the basal activity to ∼50% compared with the –470/+76 construct. Because this sequence contains a predicted ETS-like binding motif, we analyzed this sequence in more detail. By introducing subsequent 8 –10 bp 3′ deletions in this region we could demonstrate that luciferase activity was diminished when the predicted ETS-like motif and the surrounding sequences were missing, indicating that this site might be involved in controlling basal promoter activity (Fig. 4, C and D). To further test this hypothesis we next performed EMSA experiments using modified binding conditions for ETS (20Kavurma M.M. Bobryshev Y. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36244-36252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with oligonucleotides representing either the wt promoter sequence (ETSput, Fig. 5A, upper sequence) or a modified sequence carrying a mutation in the predicted ETS site (ETSmut, Fig. 5A, lower sequence). The 32P-labeled oligonucleotides were incubated with HuH7 nuclear extracts. Complex formation could be detected with the oligonucleotide representing the wt promoter sequence, which was not found with the mutant sequence (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 1 and 3). Complex formation with the wt oligonucleotide could be blocked by an antibody directed against a broad range of ETS-like factors (anti-ETS), indicating that an ETS-like factor binds to this sequence in the caspase-8 promoter. In contrast, the anti-ETS antibody had no effect on complex formation when the mutant oligonucleotide was used (Fig. 5B). Additionally, supershift analysis was performed with an ETS-1-specific antibody. However, no effect on complex formation was found (data not shown), indicating that this element is recognized by another ETS family member. Because our experiments suggested that an ETS-like factor binds to this region in the caspase-8 promoter, we introduced the mutant sequence in the –470/+76 construct (–470/+76mutETS). Transfection experiments of the mutant compared with the wt and –470/+48 construct demonstrated that luciferase activity of 470/+76mutETS was reduced to a range as found with the –470/+48 construct (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that besides the SP1, the ETS site in the promoter also contributes to the basal activity of caspase-8-dependent gene transcription.

To further evaluate the molecular mechanisms responsible for adenoviral-induced apoptosis in the liver, we wanted to examine if caspase-8-dependent gene transcription is increased after adenoviral challenge. Three hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, HuH7, Hep3B) with a different p53 status (14Muller M. Wilder S. Bannasch D. Israeli D. Lehlbach K. Li-Weber M. Friedman S.L. Galle P.R. Stremmel W. Oren M.

Efficiency of infection was controlled by GFP fluorescence (data not shown). Cells were harvested before and 8 and 24 h after adenoviral infection, and luciferase activity was measured (Fig. 6A). In HepG2 cells expressing wt p53 protein, an up to 10-fold induction of the caspase-8 promoter was observed 24 h after infection. In contrast, in hepatoma cells carrying a mutant p53 allele (HuH7 cells) or a p53 deletion (Hep3B cells) no induction was found after adenoviral infection. To test if the report"

In Trypanosoma cruzi, trypanothione is synthesized by an unusual trypanothione synthetase/amidase (TcTryS) that forms both glutathionylspermidine and trypanothione. Because T. cruzi is unable to synthesize putrescine and is dependent on uptake of exogenous polyamines by high affinity transporters, synthesis of trypanothione may be circumstantially limited by lack of spermidine. Here, we show that the parasite is able to circumvent the potential shortage of spermidine by conjugating glutathione with other physiological polyamine substrates from exogenous sources (spermine, N 8-acetylspermidine, and N-acetylspermine). Novel thiols were purified from epimastigotes, and structures were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis to be N 1,N 12-bis(glutathionyl)spermine, N 1-glutathionyl-N 8-acetylspermidine, and N 1-glutathionyl-N 12-acetylspermine, respectively.

Despite containing similar amounts of spermine and spermidine, the epimastigotes, trypomastigotes, and amastigotes of T. cruzi preferentially synthesized trypanothione. Bis(glutathionyl)spermine disulfide is a physiological substrate of recombinant trypanothione reductase, comparable to trypanothione and homotrypanothione disulfides.

In most prokaryotes and eukaryotes, glutathione/glutathione reductase and thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase systems along with associated peroxiredoxins provide these essential biochemical functions (reviewed in Refs. 2Meister A.

Although kinetoplastid parasites such as the African trypanosome (Trypanosoma brucei), the American trypanosome (Tryp-anosoma cruzi), and Leishmania spp. contain glutathione and thioredoxin, they appear to lack the respective oxidoreductases and rely on the unique trypanothione/trypanothione reductase system to maintain these intermediates in the reduced state (6Fairlamb A.H.

Steinert P. Free Radic. Biol.

The biosynthesis of trypanothione represents the convergence of two distinct metabolic pathways (glutathione and polyamine biosynthesis) (23Fairlamb A.H. Henderson G.B. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although all trypanosomatids studied so far are able to synthesize glutathione de novo (24Hunter K.J. Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Lueder D.V. Phillips M.A. J. Biol.

Medicina (Buenos Aires). 1999; 59: 179-187PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fairlamb A.H. Le Quesne S.A. Hide G. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Holmes P.H. Trypanosomiasis and Leishmaniasis: Biology and Control. CAB International, Wallingford, UK1997: 149-161Google Scholar). Notably, T. brucei and Leishmania spp. can synthesize polyamines de novo, whereas T. cruzi epimastigotes cannot (24Hunter K.J. Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, T. cruzi relies on inducible high affinity diamine transporters to salvage exogenous putrescine and cadaverine (27Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which can be converted to spermidine and aminopropylcadaverine, respectively (24Hunter K.J. Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). T. cruzi can further convert these metabolites into spermine and bis(aminopropyl)cadaverine, respectively (24Hunter K.J. Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which is unusual for a trypanosomatid. In T. brucei, spermidine is conjugated with glutathione to form glutathionylspermidine and then trypanothione (26Fairlamb A.H. Le Quesne S.A. Hide G. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Holmes P.H. Trypanosomiasis and Leishmaniasis: Biology and Control. CAB International, Wallingford, UK1997: 149-161Google Scholar). In addition to synthesizing glutathionylspermidine and trypanothione, T. cruzi is uniquely able to conjugate aminopropylcadaverine with glutathione to form glutathionylaminopropylcadaverine and homotrypanothione (N 1,N 9-bis(glutathionyl)aminopropylcadaverine) (24Hunter K.J. Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In Crithidia fasciculata, the biosynthesis of trypanothione from glutathione and spermidine is catalyzed by two distinct ATP-dependant enzymes (21Smith K. Nadeau K. Walsh C. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol.

Glutathionylspermidine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.8) forms both the N 1- and N 8-isomers of glutathionylspermidine; trypanothione synthetase (EC 6.3.1.9) subsequently catalyzes the addition of the second glutathione moiety to glutathionylspermidine. However, T. cruzi trypanothione synthetase (TcTryS) 1The abbreviations used are: TcTryS, T. cruzi trypanothione synthetase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RTH, RPMI 1640 medium/trypticase/hemin; FCS, fetal calf serum; CS, chicken serum; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; HEPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. can catalyze both biosynthetic steps (29Oza S.L.

All known glutathionylspermidine synthetase (Escherichia coli and C. fasciculata) and trypanothione synthetase (C. fasciculata and T. cruzi) sequences possess an “amidase domain” located in the N-terminal region of the protein (28Tetaud E.

J. 2002; 364: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). C. fasciculata glutathionylspermidine synthetase preferentially hydrolyzes glutathionylspermidine to GSH and spermidine (31Oza S.L. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but can also hydrolyze trypanothione and homotrypanothione at 5–10% of the rate with glutathionylspermidine when assayed under identical conditions (29Oza S.L.

In contrast, TcTryS possesses a weaker amidase activity, but hydrolyzes all the above-mentioned substrates (both mono- and bis-glutathionyl-polyamine adducts) at equivalent rates to each other (29Oza S.L. Tetaud E. Ariyanayagam M.R. Warnon S.S. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35853-35861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, unlike C. fasciculata and E. coli glutathionylspermidine synthetases, TcTryS catalyzes all biosynthetic steps from glutathione and spermidine to trypanothione and all the subsequent reverse hydrolytic steps. An enzyme with wider polyamine substrate specificity could be more favorable to an organism lacking de novo diamine synthesis. Our previous HPLC studies have identified other unknown thiol species in epimastigotes (24Hunter K.J. Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified and characterized several novel trypanothione analogues derived from spermine or other physiological polyamines. We show that TcTryS is able to catalyze both forward and reverse reactions to and from these metabolites. The physiological relevance of these novel thiols in all three life cycle stages of this parasite is discussed. Parasite Culture—T. cruzi Y strain and cloned isolate Y0 (both MHOM/BR/00/Y) and Silvio strain (MHOM/BR/78/Silvio; clone X10-7) epimastigotes were maintained by serial passage at 28 °C in RTH/FCS (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with trypticase and hemin and containing 10% fetal calf serum) (24Hunter K.J. Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When cultures were supplemented with polyamines, FCS was replaced with chicken serum (RTH/CS), which lacks amine oxidase activity (33Ebong S. Farkas W.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Comp. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 106: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Trypomastigotes were derived from monkey kidney (LLCMK2, ATCC CCL7) or human foreskin fibroblast (ATCC CRL2076) cells, which were overlaid with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1 ml/100 ml nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) and grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Routinely, trypomastigotes were harvested 5–12 days post-inoculation. Amastigotes were isolated from host cell layers 10–12 days post-inoculation by disruption with glass beads for 3–5 min in phosphate-buffered saline. Intact host cells and debris were removed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and amastigotes were recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation at 1580 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Metabolite Determination—Intracellular thiols were derivatized with the fluorescent label monobromobimane (34Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by HPLC as described (35Fairlamb A.H. Henderson G.B. Bacchi C.J. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem.

Authentic thiol standards were prepared by reduction of disulfides either enzymatically with trypanothione reductase and required cofactors (24Hunter K.J. Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or chemically with tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine, followed by derivatization with monobromobimane and purification by preparative HPLC. Total intracellular polyamines were extracted, derivatized with dansyl chloride, and analyzed by HPLC (37Hunter K.J. Morgan D. Polyamine Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 119-123Google Scholar). Polyamines were quantified with authentic standards using 1,7-diaminoheptane as the internal control. Purification of Thiol-Bimane Adducts and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—T. cruzi epimastigotes grown for 5 days in RTH/CS were supplemented with polyamines and harvested 1 day later. Approximately 8 × 108 cells were derivatized with excess monobromobimane, assuming that 108 cells contained 15 nmol of total low molecular mass thiols (38Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thiols were separated on an UltraTechsphere reverse-phase C18 column (250 × 10 mm; HPLC Technology Ltd.) using the gradient specified (34Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar), but at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Required fractions (1 min) were collected, dried down by rotary evaporation, and resuspended in 100 μl of 40 mm Li-HEPPS and 4 mm DTPA (pH 8.0). Thiols were desalted using a methanol/water/trifluoroacetic acid gradient (39Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 148-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) on an Ultra-Techsphere reverse-phase ion-paired C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm; HPLC Technology Ltd). Required fractions (0.5 or 1.0 min) were collected, dried down by rotary evaporation, and redissolved in acetonitrile/water to give a concentration of 50–100 pmol/μl thiol. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a Voyager DE-STR instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems) equipped with a nitrogen laser using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnaminic acid as the matrix. Spectra were obtained from 1–5 μl of sample, each averaging 40–100 laser shots. Kinetic Studies—Apparent Michaelis constants (K m) for polyamine analogues were determined spectrophotometrically using purified recombinant TcTryS (29Oza S.L. Tetaud E. Ariyanayagam M.R. Warnon S.S.

The kinetic parameters of bis(glutathionyl)spermine disulfide with recombinant trypanothione reductase from T. cruzi were measured in 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm NADPH (40Borges A. Cunningham M.L. Tovar J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Kinetic data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression with the program GraFit. Time Course of End Product Formation—Polyamines (10 mm final concentration, ∼10 × K m) were added to a prewarmed (25 °C) assay mixture (total of 0.1 ml) containing recombinant TcTryS (1 μm final concentration), 100 mm K-HEPPS (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgSO4, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm GSH, 6 mm tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 2 units/ml pyruvate kinase. Aliquots of 10 μl were removed at the specified time points, added to 40 μl of 40 mm Li-HEPPS and 4 mm DTPA (pH 8.0), derivatized with monobromobimane, and analyzed by HPLC. To inactivate the amidase activity, aliquots of TcTryS (3 mg/ml) were incubated with 1 mm iodoacetamide for 20 min at 4 °C and extensively dialyzed against 25 mm K-HEPPS (pH 8.0) and 10% glycerol prior to use in the above assay. Identification of Novel Glutathionyl-Polyamine Conjugates in Epimastigotes—In our previous study (32Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we noted trace amounts of an unknown thiol in cultures supplemented with spermine. To obtain sufficient amounts for analysis, cells were grown in RTH/CS (which lacks amine oxidase activity) and supplemented with 20 μm spermine at late exponential phase. Thiol analysis revealed two unknown peaks (peaks U1 and U2) (Fig. 1A), which could be abolished by N-ethylmaleimide treatment prior to derivatization with monobromobimane (data not shown). Peak U1, which corresponds to the unidentified thiol-containing peak noted in our previous study (32Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), was purified by preparative HPLC, desalted, and concentrated for analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 1B). Peak U1 gave three protonated parent ion peaks (m/z 1161.44, 971.38, and 779.29), which correspond to the predicted monoisotopic masses of bis(glutathionyl)spermine-(bimane)2 (M + H+) (Fig. 1C), bis(glutathionyl)spermine-bimane (M-bimane + H+), and bis(glutathionyl)spermine (M-(bimane)2 + H+), respectively. In addition to the parent ion peaks, clusters of daughter peaks corresponding to the NH4+ , Na+, and K+ ions of each parent ion were present (Fig. 1B). A variation of <0.2% was observed between predicted and measured monoisotopic masses. To confirm these assignments, an authentic sample of bis(glutathionyl)spermine was reduced and derivatized with monobromobimane and purified by HPLC. The authentic monobromobimane-derivatized bis(glutathionyl)spermine gave a single fluorescent product with an HPLC retention time and MALDI-TOF spectrum identical to those of peak U1 (data not shown). Thus, the three parent ions observed in peak U1 can be attributed to chemical decomposition of the bisbimane adduct during laser desorption, rather than impurities. Insufficient amounts of purified peak U2 could be obtained from derivatized cell extracts. However, because peak U2 (Fig. 1A) was present only in epimastigotes supplemented with spermine, it was tentatively assigned as monoglutathionylspermine. This assignment was subsequently confirmed by enzymatic synthesis as described below. Radiolabeling studies with [14C]spermine (10 μm final concentration, 4.96 kBq/ml) revealed that a small proportion (1.5%) of the total radioactivity was incorporated into a peak that coeluted with authentic bis(glutathionyl)spermine disulfide and that was sensitive to performic acid oxidation or acid hydrolysis (data not shown). The remainder of the radiolabel coeluted with spermine (96%), spermidine (0.8%), and a third unknown compound (0.4%) that was stable against performic acid oxidation or acid hydrolysis. Because epimastigotes are natural auxotrophs for polyamines, amines, we investigated whether T. cruzi would also conjugate glutathione with naturally occurring acetylated polyamines (N-acetylputrescine, N 1-acetylspermidine, N 8-acetylspermidine, and N-acetylspermine). Thiol analysis of epimastigote cultures supplemented with the above-mentioned polyamines showed that only the latter two gave prominent novel fluorescent peaks (peak U3 in Fig. 2A and peak U4 in Fig. 3A). Cultures supplemented with N 1-acetylspermidine also contained a minor peak that coeluted with peak U3 (2% of peak U3 in N 8-acetylspermidine cultures). To isolate sufficient material for structural analysis, epimastigote cultures were supplemented with N 8-acetylspermidine or N-acetylspermine and the bimane derivatives purified as described above.Fig. 3Identification and structural assignment of glutathione conjugated with N-acetylspermine.

The two peaks at m/z 689.43 and 705.40 correspond to the Na+ and K+ ions of M + H+, respectively. The loss of a bimane and sulfur from M + H+ may give a peak at m/z 445.14 (predicted m/z 444.27). Loss of the acetyl moiety would be consistent with the fragment at m/z 624.21. Two other minor peaks (m/z 640.20 and 656.17) could not be unambiguously assigned, although they could represent the sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives of m/z 624.21; the equivalent peaks for the parent ion at m/z 667.43 are not visible. The retention time of peak U4 is similar to that of trypanothione (Fig. 3A). However, polyamine analysis of epimastigotes grown with N-acetylspermine as supplement in RTH/FCS or RTH/CS showed no significant increase in total spermidine content (data not shown); and therefore, peak U4 could not be trypanothione. MALDI-TOF analysis of purified peak U4 gave a peak at m/z 724.38, which corresponds exactly with the predicted mass of protonated glutathionyl-N-acetylspermine-bimane (peak U4) (Fig. 3, B and C). Peaks at m/z 746.35 and 762.33 correspond to the Na+ and K+ ions of M + H+, respectively. A minor unassigned peak appeared at m/z 768.33. Peaks corresponding to the predicted masses of the protonated and sodium ions of glutathionyl-N-acetylspermine (M-bimane) appeared at m/z 534.29 and 556.29, respectively. Another peak at m/z 549.29 (with an associated Na+ ion at m/z 571.26) may represent the sulfoxide of m/z 534.29. Some minor peaks in the region of m/z 600–700 could not be assigned (<8% of the intensity of M + H+) and may be low level impurities. No peaks corresponding to the protonated ions of trypanothione-(bimane)2 (m/z 1104.25), trypanothione-bimane (m/z 914.22), and trypanothione (m/z 722.17) appeared in this sample. Thiol and Polyamine Content of the Different Life Cycle Stages of T. cruzi—The above experiments indicate that the insect (epimastigote) form is able to take up spermidine and spermine and their mono-N-acetyl derivatives and to conjugate them with glutathione. Because amastigotes reside in the cytosol of mammalian cells and are presumed to be incapable of de novo polyamine biosynthesis, we decided to compare the thiol and polyamine content of each of the life cycle stages (Table I).Table IThiol and polyamine content of the T. cruzi Yo clone in different stages of the life cycleMetaboliteMetabolite contentEpimastigoteAmastigoteTrypomastigotenmol/108 cellsPolyaminesPutrescine<0.02<0.020.05 ± 0.05Cadaverine<0.020.11 ± 0.10<0.02Spermidine0.29 ± 0.083.6 ± 0.402.94 ± 0.21Aminopropylcadaverine<0.020.12 ± 0.050.05 ± 0.01Spermine0.82 ± 0.222.18 ± 0.520.52 ± 0.13ThiolsCysteine0.16 ± 0.030.61 ± 0.120.40 ± 0.27γ-Glutamylcysteine0.15 ± 0.02<0.002<0.002Glutathione2.10 ± 0.530.42 ± 0.040.29 ± 0.13Glutathionylspermidine0.03 ± 0.020.07 ± 0.010.15 ± 0.10Trypanothione0.18 ± 0.040.12 ± 0.040.25 ± 0.10N 1 -Glutathionyl-N 8 -acetylspermidine<0.0020.013 ± 0.0060.02 ± 0.01Glutathionylspermine0.04 ± 0.02<0.002<0.002Bis(glutathionyl)spermine0.05 ± 0.02<0.0020.004 ± 0.005Ovothiol A0.23 ± 0.050.05 ± 0.020.27 ± 0.13OthersaHydrogen sulfide, thiosulfate, and sulfite.<0.0050.070.13a Hydrogen sulfide, thiosulfate, and sulfite.

Ishibashi F. Howard B.V. In Vitro (Rockville). 1982; 18: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The total spermidine and spermine content was 12- and 3-fold lower in epimastigotes compared with amastigotes, respectively (Table I). Non-dividing trypomastigotes that transformed from amastigotes and escaped into the culture medium contained similar amounts of spermidine, but 4-fold less spermine. Total polyamine content was highest in amastigotes (5.9 nmol/108 cells), followed by trypomastigotes (3.6 nmol/108 cells) and epimastigotes (1.1 nmol/108 cells).

https://openalex.org/W2082942756,"Two subunits of the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) have been identified (5-HT3A and 5-HT3B) that assemble into homomeric (5-HT3A) and heteromeric (5-HT3A+5-HT3B) complexes. Unassembled 5-HT3B subunits are efficiently retained within the cell. In this study, we address the mechanism controlling the release of 5-HT3B from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). An analysis of chimeric 5-HT3A receptor(R)·5-HT3BR constructs suggests the presence of elements downstream of the first transmembrane domain of 5-HT3B subunits that inhibit cell surface expression. To investigate this possibility, truncated 5-HT3B subunits were constructed and assessed for their ability to access the cell surface in COS-7 and ts201 cells. Using this approach, we have identified the presence of an ER retention signal located within the first cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains I and II of 5-HT3B. Transplantation of this signal (CRAR) into the homologous region of 5-HT3A results in the ER retention of this subunit until rescued by co-assembly with wild-type 5-HT3A. The mutation of this ER retention signal in 5-HT3B (5-HT3BSGER) does not lead to cell surface expression, suggesting the presence of other signals or mechanisms to control the surface expression of 5-HT3BRs.

These responses are induced by the activation of ligand-gated ion channels (5-HT3Rs). Peripheral receptors are thought to modulate pain and intestinal and cardiovascular functions (1Greenshaw A.J. Silverstone P.H. Drugs. 1997; 53: 20-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, 5-HT3Rs are important targets for the control of emesis induced post-operatively by chemotherapy and radiotherapy (2King F.D. Jones P.D.

However, the conductance of these recombinant receptors is too small to be resolved directly (sub-picosiemens), and the receptors do not resemble many native neuronal 5-HT3Rs (9–17 pS) (6Hussy N.

However, upon the co-expression of 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B, 5-HT3B is rescued and expressed on the cell surface as a heteromeric complex with a channel conductance similar to that of most native receptors (9Boyd G.W.

The 5-HT3Rs belong to the superfamily of transmitter-gated ion channels that includes the nicotinic acetylcholine, GABAA, and glycine receptors. The structural relationship of the 5-HT3Rs to the other members of this group suggests that their assembly may involve similar post-translational events (12Green W.N. Millar N.S.

Interaction with such proteins can cause the intracellular retention of immature proteins by virtue of ER retention signals within the chaperone molecules.

To investigate the mechanisms involved in the ER retention of the 5-HT3BR, we have examined the assembly and surface expression of 5-HT3A·5-HT3B subunit chimeras and truncation mutants of 5-HT3B. We demonstrate that 5-HT3B possesses an ER retention signal capable of preventing homomeric cell surface expression. This “CRAR” signal requires masking by subunit interactions with the 5-HT3A subunit, regardless of whether it is present natively in the 5-HT3B subunit or recombinantly within the homologous position in 5-HT3A. In addition, the export of 5-HT3B from the ER appears to require the masking or exposure of other signals downstream from this ER retention signal. Cell Culture and Transfection—Simian COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL 1651) and mammalian embryonic kidney tsA201 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Exponentially growing COS-7 cells were transfected by electroporation (400 V, infinity resistance, 125 μF, Bio-Rad Gene Electropulser II). 10 μg of DNA was used per transfection (2 × 106 cells), using equimolar ratios of expression constructs.

The 5-HT3B truncation mutants were generated by PCR and sub-cloned into pGW1 using XhoI and BamHI sites introduced into oligonucleotides used as primers. The oligonucleotides were: 3B start, 5′-GCCCCTCGAGGAATGTTGTCAAGTGTAATGGCTCCCCTG-3′; TMI, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCTCACAGGTAGAAGCTCCCCAGGTCCACC-3′; 267, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCTCAGCAGTTGGGTGGCAGGTAGAAGCTC-3′; 268, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCCTATCGGCAGTTTGGTGGTAGGTAGAAG-3′; 269, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCCTATGCTCGGCAGTTTGGTGGTAGGTAG-3′; 270, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCCTATCGTGCTCGGCAGTTTGGTGGTAGG-3′; TMII, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCCTAGTTGGACATGTTGACCCTGAAGACG-3′; 349, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCTCAGTCAGCATCGGTGTCCCCTCGAAGG-3′; 369, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCCTATCCATACAGCGAGGACTCTGTTACC-3′; 380, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCTCATTCCTTCAGGGTTCCTGGCTGGGC-3′; 393, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCTCATTGGAGGTAGTTGCTGATAGATTG-3′; 411, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCTCAGCGGGACAGGAGGACCAGCCACTC-3′; 418, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCTCATTGGAAGAGCAGTCGGTCAAAGCGG-3′; 3B(SGER)-270, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCCTAAGCGAGAGGACTGTTGGGTGGCAGC-3′; and 3B(SGER)-TMII, 5′-CCCGGGGGATCCCTAGTTGGACATGTTGACCCTGAAGACG-3′. The 3A(TMI-II) and 3B(TMI-II) were PCR-amplified and cloned (XbaI/HindIII) into pGW1 containing the Myc-tagged signal sequence of GABAA receptor β3 subunit (cloned in by EcoRI/XbaI following PCR amplification with the oligonucleotides: 5′-GGGCCCGAATTCAAGATGTGGGGCTTTGCGGGAGGAAGG-3′ and 5′-GGGCCCTCTAGACTTCACAAAGGACATGTTCCCTGGGTC-3′) using the oligonucleotides: 5′-GGGCCCTCTAGACTCTTCTATGTGGTCAGCCTGCTA-3′ and 5′-GGGCCCAAGCTTAGAAACGATGATCAGGAAGAC-3′ (5-HT3A) or 5′-GGGCCCTCTAGACTGGTCTATGTCGTGAGTCTGCTG-3′ and 5′-GGGCCCAAGCTTGGACATGTTGACCCTGAAGAC-3′ (5-HT3B). The chimera 5-HT3A·5-HT3B fuses the extracellular amino-terminal and TM1 domains of the 5-HT3A subunit with the remainder of the 5-HT3B sequence (i.e. 5-HT3A Met-1-Asn-269·5-HT3B Cys-262-Val-436). The chimera 5-HT3B·5-HT3A combines residues defining the extracellular amino-terminal TM1 and TM2 domains of 5-HT3B (i.e. 5-HT3B Met-1-Arg-289) with the remainder of 5-HT3A (i.e. 5-HT3A Thr-298-Ala-478). The chimeras were constructed using a PCR-based approach as outlined below. For construction of the 5-HT3A·5-HT3B cDNA, a fragment of 5-HT3A cDNA was amplified using the XL-PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with the primers 5′-GAGAACCACTGCTTAACTGGCTTATCGAA-3′ and 5′-TCCTGGCTCGGCAGTTGGGGGGCAGGTAGAAGCCCACGA-3′. A fragment of the 5-HT3B subunit cDNA was amplified using the primers 5′-TCTACCTGCCCCCCAACTGCCGAGCCAGGATTGTGTTCA-3′ and 5′-TTGTCCAATTATGTCACACCACAGAAGTAA-3′. The two fragments were annealed and amplified with the primers 5′-GAGAACCACTGCTTAACTGGCTTATCGAA-3′ and 5′-TTGTCCAATTATGTCACACCACAGAAGTAA-3′. The amplified products were digested with HindIII and XhoI and ligated between the HindIII and XhoI sites of pCDM8. The protocol above was followed to construct the 5-HT3B·5-HT3A cDNA, using the following primers: 5′-GAGAACCACTGCTTAACTGGCTTATCGAA-3′, 5′-GTGCCGATGGCAGTCCGTGGCACCTGGTTGGACATGTTGA-3′, and 5′-ACCAGGTGCCACGGACTGCCATCGGCACTCCTCTCATTG-3′, 5′-TTGTCCAATTATGTCACACCACAGAAGTAA-3′. The two fragments were then joined, amplified, digested, and ligated as described above for the 5-HT3A·5-HT3B cDNA. All cDNAs were sequenced over their entire lengths. Antibodies—Anti-Myc and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were harvested from 9E10 or 12CA5 hybridoma cell lines, respectively, and used direct as supernatant (20 μg/ml) or purified on immobilized protein A. For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with tsA201 cells, mAbHA-7 was obtained from Sigma. Rabbit anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at 2 μg/ml in co-immunofluorescence experiments. The secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568, goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488, and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 were purchased from Molecular Probes and used at 1 μg/ml. The secondary antibody, sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase, was purchased from Amersham Biosciences and used at 1/1000. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (21Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells cultured on coverslips were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (15 min in phosphate-buffered saline) and quenched twice in 50 mm NH4Cl (in phosphate-buffered saline). Subsequent washes and antibody dilutions were performed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (block). When appropriate, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min, quenched, blocked, and processed as above. Coverslips were examined using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM510). Enzyme-linked Assay of Cell Surface and Intracellular Expression Levels—Cell surface antibody binding was assayed on tsA201 cells grown on poly-l-lysine and collagen-coated glass coverslips. Coverslips were blocked (2% bovine serum albumin), incubated in primary antibody, and fixed as described previously (32Cooper S.T. Harkness P.C. Baker E.R. Millar N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27145-27152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 33Harkness P.C. Millar N.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10172-10181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure total (cell surface and internal) antibody binding, fixed cells were exposed for 15 min to 0.1% Triton X-100. Coverslips were processed as above, but 0.1% Triton X-100 was included in all incubation buffers and in buffer used for the first two washing steps. Antibody solutions contained, additionally, 5% fetal calf serum. When surface and total antibody binding levels were compared, coverslips (with permeabilized or intact cells) were fixed before addition of primary antibody and assayed in parallel. Additionally, lysine (25 mm) was added to buffers to reduce nonspecific binding. In all cases, coverslips were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) and washed five times before incubation with 750 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) for 30 min. The supernatant was transferred to a cuvette, and absorbance was determined at 655 nm. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were l-methionine-starved for 30 min before being labeled with [35S]methionine (0.5 mCi per 10-cm dish, Translabel ICN/Flow) for 4 h. Cells were lysed in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 nm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml antipain, 10 mg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin (lysis buffer). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (21Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. Cross-linking experiments were performed by the treatment of cells with dimethyl pimelimidate, 7.6 mg/ml) followed by quenching in 100 mm Tris (pH 8) prior to cell lysis. Cell Surface Expression of Homomeric and Heteromeric 5-HT 3 Rs—The subcellular distribution and assembly of 5-HT3Rs was examined by heterologous expression of 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunit cDNAs in COS-7 cells. To facilitate biochemical and morphological analyses, 5-HT3R subunits were tagged using the Myc or hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes. These epitope tags were added at the amino terminus of 5-HT3 subunits between amino acids 5 and 6 of the mature polypeptides (downstream from the predicted signal sequence cleavage site) and appear to be silent (9Boyd G.W. Low P. Dunlop J.I. Robertson L.A. Vardy A. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The subcellular distribution of the tagged 5-HT3Rs expressed in COS-7 cells was determined by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. As shown previously (9Boyd G.W. Low P. Dunlop J.I. Robertson L.A. Vardy A. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), 5-HT3A-Myc when expressed alone and assessed for Myc immunofluorescence revealed surface labeling, as determined by secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 staining in the absence of detergent (Fig. 1A, left panel). The same cells were then permeabilized and processed for immunofluorescence a second time, using an Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibody to detect intracellular subunits. It should be noted that surface receptors would also be labeled after permeabilization because of the presence of free antibody-binding sites present on the secondary antibody (capable of binding the second round of primary antibody). However, significant additional staining is observed after permeabilization, indicating the presence of intracellular 5-HT3A subunits. The intracellular staining pattern is consistent with an ER distribution, suggesting the presence of unassembled receptor subunits. In contrast, upon the expression of 5-HT3B-Myc, no surface expression is observed (Fig. 1A, middle panel). However, substantial staining was evident after permeabilization, suggesting that the 5-HT3B-Myc subunit cannot reach the cell surface when expressed alone but is retained intracellularly within the ER as reported previously (9Boyd G.W. Low P. Dunlop J.I. Robertson L.A. Vardy A. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Upon co-expression of 5-HT3A-HA, the 5-HT3B-Myc subunit was rescued and expressed on the cell surface as a heteromeric complex (Fig. 1A, right panel). To identify the region responsible for the ER retention of 5-HT3B, two Myc-tagged chimeric receptor subunits, 5-HT3A·5-HT3B and 5-HT3B·5-HT3A, were analyzed (Fig. 1B). These constructs were expressed in COS-7 cells and analyzed by immunofluorescence. Despite being expressed at high levels within the ER, no surface staining was observed for the 5-HT3A·5-HT3B chimera (Fig. 1B, left panels). In contrast, the 5-HT3B·5-HT3A chimera exhibits cell surface staining (Fig. 1B, right panels). Furthermore, upon [35S]methionine labeling and cross-linking, high molecular weight oligomers were evident when separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C), suggesting the ability of the 5-HT3B·5-HT3A construct to assemble into homomeric receptors. Thus, elements downstream from the first transmembrane domain are either inhibitory (in 5-HT3B) or promote (in 5-HT3A) cell surface delivery. To probe for the existence of regions influencing cell surface expression within the 5-HT3B-Myc subunit, a series of truncated 5-HT3B subunits was constructed. Subunits were truncated after the transmembrane domain I, between transmembrane domain 1 and II (following residue 267), after transmembrane domain II, and between transmembrane domains III and IV (following residues 349, 369, 380, 393, 411, and 418) (Fig. 2A). The rationale for this approach is that if inhibitory signals exist within 5-HT3B and are responsible for ER retention, then once all such signals are removed the resulting protein will be released from the ER and expressed on the cell surface. To confirm the fidelity of the truncated constructs, COS-7-transfected cells were [35S]methionine-labeled and immunoprecipitated using 9E10 antibodies. The approximate molecular masses of the polypeptide backbones of the truncations are expected to be: 28.8 kDa (TMI-stop), 29.4 kDa (267-stop), 31.8 kDa (TMII-stop), 38.4 kDa (349-stop), 40.6 kDa (369-stop), 41.8 kDa (380-stop), 43.2 kDa (393-stop), 45.2 kDa (411-stop), 46 kDa (418-stop), and 48.5 kDa (full-length). In addition, 5-HT3B-Myc has five potential N-linked glycosylation sites, each expected to contribute ∼2–3 kDa to the molecular mass. The apparent molecular mass of the 5-HT3B-Myc-truncated subunits (Fig. 2B) is consistent with the presence of multiple sites for N-linked glycosylation and the presence of degradation products, as observed previously (9Boyd G.W. Low P. Dunlop J.I. Robertson L.A. Vardy A. Lambert J.J. Peters J.A. Connolly C.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 38-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When expressed in COS-7 cells, truncations of 5-HT3B at positions 418, 411, 393, 380, 369, 349, and TMII all had no effect on ER retention and did not result in surface expression (Fig. 2C, lower panels). In contrast, when 5-HT3B was truncated to residue 267, found between TMI and TMII, surface expression was observed. Similarly, a further truncation of 5-HT3B, such that the construct terminated at TMI, also resulted in cell surface expression. Quantification by a cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed the results observed by immunofluorescence. No significant cell surface detection of 5-HT3B or when the construct was truncated to TMII was observed. In contrast, a significant enhancement of cell surface receptors (>14-fold, compared with TMII truncation) could be detected for the TMI truncation. These findings suggest the existence of an ER retention signal within 5-HT3B within the first cytoplasmic domain, between TMI and TMII. Interestingly, this cytoplasmic domain possesses a potential ER retention motif “RAR” analogous to those found in other receptors (23Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 25Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J.

Comparison of the homologous regions between 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B (Fig. 3A) revealed that these subunits differ in only four residues incorporating the RAR motif. To assess the capacity of this putative motif to function in ER retention we generated a mutant 5-HT3AR containing CRAR in place of SGER, termed 5-HT3A(CRAR). In keeping with a role in ER retention, this signal is capable of preventing the cell surface expression of 5-HT3A(CRAR) (Fig. 3B). To eliminate the possibility that the mutant receptor subunit was unable to correctly fold and assemble, the 5-HT3A(CRAR) was co-expressed with wild-type 5-HT3A. Under these circumstances the 5-HT3A(CRAR) was rescued from the ER in a similar manner to the wild-type 5-HT3B subunit. Furthermore, the 5-HT3A(CRAR) could not be rescued by wild-type 5-HT3B (not shown). To assess the role of this ER retention signal within 5-HT3B, a reciprocal mutation was constructed, yielding 5-HT3B(SGER). The subcellular distribution of this construct was indistinguishable from wild-type 5-HT3B, in that it was efficiently retained within the ER when expressed alone yet could be rescued upon the co-expression of 5-HT3A, but not 5-HT3B (Fig. 3B). The failure of the 5-HT3B(SGER) to access the cell surface might be explained by the existence of other ER retention signals. To address this issue, the 5-HT3B(SGER) construct was used to generate truncations at residue 270 and TMII. The truncation of 5-HT3B(SGER) at residue 270 (immediately following SGER) resulted in cell surface expression (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, and in direct contrast to the findings of the 5-HT3B (Fig. 2C), when the 5-HT3B(SGER) was truncated at TMII significant cell surface expression was observed (Fig. 3C). These findings confirm the ability of the RAR signal to function as an ER retention signal in both 5-HT3A and 5-HT"

To facilitate studies on the structural mechanisms governing M3 receptor activation, we generated an M3 receptor-expressing yeast strain (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that requires agonist-dependent M3 receptor activation for cell growth. By using receptor random mutagenesis followed by a genetic screen in yeast, we initially identified a point mutation at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane domain (TM) VI (Q490L) that led to robust agonist-independent M3 receptor signaling in both yeast and mammalian cells. To explore further the molecular mechanisms by which point mutations can render GPCRs constitutively active, we subjected a region of the Q490L mutant M3 receptor that included TM V–VII to random mutagenesis. We then applied a yeast genetic screen to identify second-site mutations that could suppress the activating effects of the Q490L mutation and restore wild-type receptor-like function to the Q490L mutant receptor. This analysis led to the identification of 12 point mutations that allowed the Q490L mutant receptor to function in a fashion similar to the wild-type receptor. These amino acid substitutions mapped to two distinct regions of the M3 receptor, the exofacial segments of TM V and VI and the cytoplasmic ends of TM V–VII. Strikingly, in the absence of the activating Q490L mutation, all recovered point mutations severely reduced the efficiency of receptor/G protein coupling, indicating that the targeted residues play important roles in receptor activation and/or receptor/G protein coupling. This strategy should be generally applicable to identify sites in GPCRs that are critically involved in receptor function.

Despite the remarkable structural diversity of ligands acting on specific GPCRs, all GPCRs are thought to share a conserved three-dimensional structure characterized by a bundle of seven transmembrane helices (TM I–VII) that are connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops (1Pierce K.L.

However, a major limitation of such classical mutagenesis strategies is that the number of mutant proteins that can be generated and characterized in a single study is usually relatively small. To facilitate the rapid screening of large numbers of mutant GPCRs, we recently established a heterologous expression system that allows the functional characterization of various muscarinic acetylcholine (8Erlenbach I.

The muscarinic and vasopressin receptors are prototypical members of the class I GPCR subfamily that is particularly large and contains most classical neurotransmitter and hormone receptors (1Pierce K.L.

Structural analysis of the recovered mutant receptors provided novel information regarding the structural elements that govern the G protein coupling selectivity of this receptor subtype (9Erlenbach I.

We recently described a strategy that allows the functional expression of the M3 muscarinic receptor, as well as other muscarinic receptor subtypes, in yeast (8Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To facilitate structure-function relationship studies, the M3 receptor was expressed in genetically modified yeast strains that required ligand-dependent receptor/G protein coupling for cell growth (8Erlenbach I.

In this heterologous expression system, deletion of the large central portion of the third intracellular loop (i3 loop) of the M3 receptor led to a dramatic increase in receptor density, probably due to the removal of sequences that promote degradation of the M3 receptor in yeast (8Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The M3 receptor did not couple well to G proteins containing the endogenous yeast G protein α subunit, Gpa1p, or a mutant version of Gpa1p containing five amino acids of mammalian αs sequence at its C terminus (8Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the M3 receptor coupled efficiently to G proteins containing a mutant version of Gpa1p in which the last five amino acids of Gpa1p were replaced with the corresponding sequence of mammalian αq (8Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These findings indicated that the M3 muscarinic receptor, which selectively interacts with G proteins of the Gq family in mammalian cells (4Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), retains the proper G protein coupling selectivity in yeast.Constitutively active mutant GPCRs have served as useful research tools to study the molecular mechanisms involved in GPCR activation (19Parnot C.

In most cases, activating GPCR mutations appear to involve the mutational modification of amino acids predicted to be engaged in interhelical (intramolecular) interactions critical for stabilizing the inactive receptor conformation (19Parnot C.

To learn more about the molecular mechanisms by which point mutations can render GPCRs constitutively active, we employed receptor random mutagenesis followed by a yeast genetic screen to identify second-site mutations that could restore wild-type (WT) receptor function to the Q490L mutant receptor. A considerable body of work indicates that the isolation of intragenic second-site suppressor mutations represents a useful approach to the structural and functional analysis of different membrane proteins including the yeast α-factor receptor (13Sommers C.M. Dumont M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 559-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).This screen led to the identification of 12 point mutations that were able to “silence” the Q490L mutant M3 receptor and enabled it to function in a fashion similar to the WT receptor. The recovered mutations were clustered either around the ligand binding pocket or mapped to distinct sites on the intracellular surface of the receptor. Interestingly, in the absence of the activating Q490L mutation, all recovered point mutations severely reduced the efficiency of receptor/G protein coupling, indicating that the targeted residues play important roles in receptor activation and/or receptor/G protein coupling.These findings highlight the usefulness of yeast expression technology to study the molecular mechanisms involved in GPCR function. Since the M3 muscarinic receptor is a prototypical class I GPCR, the findings obtained here should also be applicable to other members of this receptor family.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol), atropine sulfate, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, glass beads (425–600 μm, acid-washed), and Tween 20 were obtained from Sigma. N-[3H]Methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS; 70 Ci/mmol), AmpliTaq® DNA Polymerase, and Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. myo-[3H]Inositol (20 Ci/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Yeast media components were purchased from Qbiogene, Inc. Media for mammalian cell culture, precast Novex® Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and buffers used for Western blotting were from Invitrogen. The BCA™ protein assay kit was purchased from Pierce. The mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. The anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was from Roche Applied Science. All enzymes used for molecular cloning were from New England Biolabs. The p416GPD, p416TEF, and p416ADH yeast expression plasmids were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).Construction of Plasmids—All mutations were introduced into a modified version of the rat M3 muscarinic receptor that lacked the central portion of the i3 loop (Ala274–Lys469) and contained a 9-amino acid HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) inserted after the initiating methionine codon (8Erlenbach I.

Previous studies showed that these modifications have little effect on the ligand binding and G protein-coupling properties of the M3 muscarinic receptor (8Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C.

For the sake of simplicity, this i3 loop-shortened, epitope-tagged version of the M3 receptor is referred to as ‘WT‘-M3 receptor throughout the paper.The 'WT'-M3 receptor coding sequence was inserted into the polylinker of the yeast expression plasmid, p416GPD, as described previously (8Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). p416GPD is a single copy plasmid containing the CEN/ARS element, the URA3 gene as selectable marker for maintenance in yeast, and the Amp gene for propagation in Escherichia coli (28Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). In an analogous fashion, the 'WT'-M3 receptor coding sequence was also cloned into two related yeast expression plasmids, p416TEF and p416ADH (28Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). These three expression plasmids contain the yeast GPD (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), TEF (translation elongation factor 1α), and ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase 1) promoters, respectively. Introduction of the activating Q490L point mutation into 'WT'-M3-p416GPD resulted in plasmid 'WT'-M3(Q490L)-p416GPD. Point mutations isolated during the yeast genetic screen (see below) were introduced de novo into 'WT'-M3-p416GPD and 'WT'-M3(Q490L)p416GPD by standard PCR mutagenesis techniques (29Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar). The identity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing.Yeast Strains, Growth, and Transformation—The haploid yeast strain MPY578q5 (MAT a GPA1 far1::LYS2 fus1::FUS1-HIS3 sst2::SST2-G418r ste2::LEU2 fus2::FUS2-CAN1 ura3 lys2 ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 can1) was used as a host for the expression of all receptor constructs. This strain is isogenic to strain MPY578fc (16Pausch M.H. Price L.A. Kajkowski E.M. Strnad J. dela Cruz F. Heinrich J. Ozenberger B.A. Hadcock J.R. Lynch K.R. Identification and Expression of G Protein-coupled Receptors. Wiley-Liss, New York1998: 196-212Google Scholar) except for the G protein α subunit. Whereas the fc strain carries the WT GPA1 gene coding for the native yeast Gα, the q5 strains used in the present study harbors a mutant version of GPA1 coding for a Gα subunit in which the last 5 amino acids of Gpa1p (KIGII) were replaced with the corresponding sequence derived from mammalian αq (EYNLV) (8Erlenbach I.

In these strains, deletion of the FAR1 gene allows yeast to grow despite G protein-mediated activation of the pheromone pathway that normally leads to growth arrest (8Erlenbach I. Kostenis E.

Ozenberger B.A. Hadcock J.R. Lynch K.R. Identification and Expression of G Protein-coupled Receptors. Wiley-Liss, New York1998: 196-212Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of the FUS1-HIS3 reporter construct makes the production of His3 protein dependent on receptor-mediated activation of the yeast pheromone pathway, allowing auxotrophic (his3) yeast strains expressing coupling-competent receptors to grow in histidine-deficient media. The SST2 gene was disrupted to prevent attenuation of G protein signaling mediated by the GTPaseactivating protein activity of Sst2p. The STE2 gene encoding the yeast α-factor (pheromone) receptor was deleted to prevent the sequestration of co-expressed G proteins.Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in synthetic complete medium (SC) (30Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar) unless noted otherwise. Cells were transformed with plasmid DNA coding for the different receptor constructs by using a lithium acetate method (31Agatep, R., Kirkpatrick, R. D., Parchaliuk, D. L., Woods, R. A., and Gietz, R. D. (1998) Technical Tips Online 1:51:P01525, http://tto.trends.com.Google Scholar). Transformants were selected and maintained in SC medium lacking uracil (SC-Ura).Yeast Functional Assays—Mid-log phase cell cultures (1–4 × 107 cells/ml) were washed with PBS and diluted to 105 cells/ml in SC medium lacking uracil and histidine (pH 7). Unless stated otherwise, growth assays were carried out using 96-well microtiter dishes essentially as described (8Erlenbach I. Kostenis E. Schmidt C. Hamdan F.F. Pausch M.H. Wess J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1327-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions were incubated at 25 °C for 72 h in the presence of carbachol (10–4 to 10–13m serial dilutions). Basal growth was measured in the absence of ligand, and cell viability was monitored in the presence of histidine (20 μg/ml). Background growth was suppressed by the addition of 5 mm of AT. Receptor-mediated yeast growth was assessed by measuring increases in the absorbance of the yeast cultures at 630 nm. Assays were conducted in triplicate, using three independent transformants. Growth rate measurements were obtained during the logarithmic phase of yeast cell growth. Carbachol concentration-response curves were analyzed using the KaleidaGraph™ program (Synergy Software).Mutagenesis of the Q490L Mutant M 3 Muscarinic Receptor—We recently used PCR-based receptor random mutagenesis (32Fromant M.

A subsequent yeast screen (this screen will be described in detail elsewhere) 2C. Schmidt and J. Wess, manuscript in preparation. yielded a mutant receptor, ‘WT‘-M3(Q490L), which displayed robust agonist-independent signaling.To identify secondary mutations that restore WT receptor function to the 'WT'-M3(Q490L) mutant receptor, a C-terminal region of the 'WT'-M3(Q490L) receptor that included TM V–VII (Arg213–Cys562) was subjected to random mutagenesis (Fig. 1). In the first step, two separate receptor regions, coding for Arg213–Ile508 and Thr475–Cys562 (Fig. 1 and Table I), were amplified under mutagenic PCR conditions (32Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateu P. Ann. Biochem. 1995; 224: 347-353Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In each case (receptor region), four independent PCRs were carried out (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 9.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 8 units of AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase, 500 nm of each primer, and 100 ng of 'WT'-M3(Q490L)-p416GPD as template, in 100-μl reaction mixtures), each containing 3.4 mm of one “forcing” dNTP and 0.2 mm of the three other dNTPs. After 30 PCR cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min), the products were purified from an agarose gel and mixed at equivalent concentrations.

Previous in vitro studies have shown that the binding of GRK to membrane-associated Gβγ subunits plays an important role in translocation of GRK2 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. The current study investigated the role of the interaction of GRK2 with the activated δ-opioid receptor (DOR) and Gβγ subunits in the membrane translocation and function of GRK2 using intact human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Our results showed that agonist treatment induced GRK2 binding to DOR, GRK2 translocation to the plasma membrane, and DOR phosphorylation in cells expressing the wild-type DOR but not the mutant DOR lacking the carboxyl terminus, which contains all three GRK2 phosphorylation sites. DORs with the GRK2 phosphorylation sites modified (M3) or with the acidic residues flanking phosphorylation sites mutated (E355Q/D364N) failed to be phosphorylated in response to agonist stimulation. Agonist-induced GRK2 membrane translocation and GRK-receptor association were observed in cells expressing M3 but not E355Q/D364N. Moreover, over-expression of Gβγ subunits promoted GRK2 binding to DOR, whereas over-expression of transducin α or the carboxyl terminus of GRK2 blocked binding. Further study demonstrated that agonist stimulation induced the formation of a complex containing DOR, GRK2, and Gβγ subunits in the cell and that agonist-stimulated formation of this complex is essential for the stable localization of GRK2 on the membrane and for its catalytic activity in vivo.

More than 1,000 of 19,000 open reading frames in the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans (1Bargmann C.I. Science. 1998; 282: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) encode GPCRs, and more than 600 GPCR genes have been identified in the human genome (2Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W.

GPCRs transduce a huge number of extracellular signals from hormones, neurotransmitters, chemokines, and other environmental stimuli to the interior of cells and thus play fundamental roles in regulating a variety of cellular functions (3Wess J.

An important feature of GPCR-mediated signal transduction is that repeated agonist stimulation triggers a negative feedback regulatory mechanism that attenuates GPCR-mediated signal transduction (desensitization). The initial event of receptor desensitization is agonist-stimulated receptor phosphorylation catalyzed by GPCR kinases (GRKs) (5Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin.

Seven members of the GRK family have been identified to date, and they have been divided on the basis of structural and functional similarities into rhodopsin kinase (GRK1 and GRK7), the β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) kinase (GRK2 and GRK3), and the GRK4 (GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6) subfamilies (6Hisatomi O.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar).The functions of GRKs are highly regulated in the cell. GRKs preferentially catalyze phosphorylation of the activated (agonist-occupied) rather than the inactive or antagonist-occupied GPCR substrates (9Benovic J.L. Strasser R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The interactions of GRKs with the activated receptor substrates in turn potently activate GRKs (10Penn R.B. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The participation of regulatory mechanisms responsible for the membrane localization and receptor targeting of GRKs is required for agonist-induced GPCR phosphorylation. Studies revealed that the members of the βAR kinase subfamily of GRKs (GRK2 and GRK3) exhibit an agonist-dependent association with cell membranes and that the agonist-induced GRK2 translocation to plasma membrane precedes receptor phosphorylation and desensitization (11Strasser R.H. Benovic J L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6362-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Studies using purified components demonstrated that the βγ subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins (Gβγ) interact with the carboxyl tail of GRK2 and promote the association of GRK2 with lipid vesicles and rod outer segment membranes. Furthermore, this interaction stimulated the phosphorylation of rhodopsin and βAR in vitro (12Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

The association of GRK2 and Gβγ has been demonstrated using purified GRK2 in vitro and recently using co-immunoprecipitation in vivo (14Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Parne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

These studies proposed the following model: following the release of the free Gβγ dimer led by agonist occupancy of a GPCR, GRK2 binds to the membrane-bound Gβγ and subsequently targets GRK2 to the activated GPCR substrate. This model remains to be tested in vivo, and the detailed mechanism of GRK2 translocation to plasma membrane must still be developed.Our earlier work demonstrated that GRK2 phosphorylates the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) upon opioid challenge and results in desensitization of DOR. This work also identified the GRK2 phosphorylation sites in DOR (17Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhao J. Pei G. Huang Y.L.

The current study explores the mechanism of GRK2-catalyzed GPCR phosphorylation in a mammalian cellular system. We have demonstrated for the first time the formation of a stable Gβγ-GRK2-DOR complex on the membrane in response to agonist stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the requirement of the agonist-induced formation of the receptor-GRK2-Gβγ complex for the stable membrane association and function of GRK2 in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[d-Pen2,d-Pen5]Enkephalin (DPDPE), [d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO), and naloxone were obtained from Sigma.

The HA-tagged mouse DOR mutants E355Q, D364N, and E355Q/D364N were constructed by PCR mutagenesis, and the authenticity of the sequences was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Bovine GRK3 cDNA was provided by Dr. Lin Li (Shanghai Institutes of Life Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences) and was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with a sequence encoding a FLAG tag to generate GRK3 with an amino-terminal tag (FLAG-GRK3). The GRK2-GFP pcDNA construct was a generous gift from Dr. Marc G. Caron (Duke University Medical Center).Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells cultured in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum were seeded in 60- or 100-mm tissue culture dishes at 1–3 × 106/dish for 20 h before transfection. In immunofluorescence experiments, cells were seeded in 6-well plates or 35-mm tissue culture dishes. Plasmids (1–5 μg each) were transfected into the cells using the calcium phosphate method. The cells were used 44 h after transfection, and the expression of opioid receptors was measured by a radioligand binding assay as described previously (17Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of the opioid receptors expressed were 2–3 pmol/mg of protein.Receptor Phosphorylation—Measurement of opioid receptor phosphorylation was carried out as described previously (17Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhao J. Pei G. Huang Y.L. Zhong F.M. Ma L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 238: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were metabolically labeled at 37 °C for 60 min with 60 μCi/ml of 32Pi in phosphate-free Dulbecco's MEM, and 1 μm okadaic acid or 5 μm cantharidin was added 3 min before the end of labeling. Then the cells were exposed to 1 μm DPDPE at 37 °C for 10 min and solubilized at 4 °C for 1.5 h in buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 5 μm cantharidin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). HA-DORs were immunoprecipitated with 12CA5, and the immunoprecipitation complexes were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels. After drying, the gels were subjected to quantitative analysis with a Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences).[35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—The experiments were performed as described previously (21Cheng Z.J. Fan G.H. Zhao J. Zhang Z. Wu Y.L. Jiang L.Z. Zhu Y. Pei G. Ma L. NeuroReport. 1997; 8: 1913-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μm DPDPE at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were then lysed in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA at 4 °C, and the lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 10 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended, and an aliquot (containing 8 μg of protein) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 40 μm GDP, and 8 nm [35S]GTPγS (1200 Ci/mmol) in the presence or absence of 1 mm DPDPE. The reaction was terminated by dilution in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and filtered through GF/C filters under vacuum. Bound radioactivity was determined in duplicate by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. Basal binding was determined in the absence of agonist, and nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm nonradioactive GTPγS. The stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding was calculated as a percentage as follows: 100 × [(cpmsample – cpmnonspecific)/(cpmbasal – cpmnonspecific)].Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Procedures—HEK293 cells in 100-mm dishes were incubated at 37 °C in serum-free MEM in the presence or absence of 1 μm DPDPE for 3 min. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described (22Dhami G.K.

The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with 1 μg of 12CA5 and 10 μlof50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 4 h. The beads were subsequently washed three times with lysis buffer. The proteins bound to the beads were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The presence of HA-DOR, GRK, and Gβγ in the immunocomplexes was detected in the subsequent Western procedure with antibody specifically against HA, GRK2, FLAG, GRK5, or Gβ, respectively. The immunoblots were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. An aliquot (2.5%) of the cell lysate was analyzed on Western blots without immunoprecipitation to quantify expression level of the protein studied.Laser Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—After incubation in serum-free MEM at 37 °C for 60 min, the cells grown on coverslips were incubated in the presence or absence of DPDPE at 37 °C for 3 min and fixed. The cells were then incubated with 12CA5 (1 μg/ml) in PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature and washed with PBS. The cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1 μg/ml) at room temperature for 1 h and washed with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides with 50% glycerol. Scanning images were recorded with a TCS NT laser confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bensheim, Germany).Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using the Student's t test for comparison of independent means with pooled estimates of common variances.RESULTSOur earlier study demonstrated that agonist-induced phosphorylation of DOR occurs on the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain of the receptor and is mediated by GRK2 (18Zhao J. Pei G. Huang Y.L. Zhong F.M. Ma L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 238: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Guo J. Wu Y.L. Zhang W.B. Zhao J. Devi L.A. Pei G. Ma L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that the cytoplasmic tail of DOR is also important for interaction with GRK, although interaction between GRK2 and DOR has not been demonstrated directly. As shown in Fig. 1A, stimulation of the HEK293 cells expressing the wild-type DOR with DPDPE, a specific agonist of DOR, induced DOR phosphorylation. Co-expression of GRK2 strongly enhanced agonist-dependent phosphorylation of DOR. In contrast, truncated DOR lacking the carboxyl-terminal 31 residues (Δ31), although possessing unchanged surface expression and G protein coupling (18Zhao J. Pei G. Huang Y.L. Zhong F.M. Ma L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 238: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Guo J. Wu Y.L. Zhang W.B. Zhao J. Devi L.A. Pei G. Ma L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), failed to be phosphorylated upon DPDPE challenge even in cells over-expressing GRK2. After stimulation with the DOR-specific agonist DPDPE, GRK2 could be co-immunoprecipitated with DOR in cells expressing DOR WT and GRK2 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, no GRK2 was detected in the receptor complex in the absence of agonist challenge. Furthermore, the agonist-dependent association of GRK and DOR was time-dependent and paralleled receptor phosphorylation (data not shown). Binding of GRK2 to the receptor immunoprecipitation complex was detected 1 min following agonist stimulation, and maximal binding was reached in 3–5 min. The binding decreased 5 min after stimulation and was not detectable after 10 min. DADLE, another δ-specific agonist, but not DAMGO, a μ-specific opioid agonist, could stimulate the formation of DOR-GRK2 complex in cells expressing DOR, and agonist-induced formation of DOR-GRK2 complex could be completely blocked by the opioid-specific antagonist naloxone (Fig. 1B). In contrast to observations with the wild-type DOR, no GRK2 was co-immunoprecipitated with the mutant receptor Δ31. This mutant lacks the cytoplasmic tail and all of the GRK2 phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate directly that agonist stimulation induces GRK2 binding to DOR and that the 31 amino acid residues in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the receptor are critical for its interaction with GRK.HEK293 cells then were transfected with GRK2-GFP and DOR, and the subcellular distribution of GRK upon agonist stimulation was examined using a laser confocal microscope. As shown in Fig 1C, GRK2 was uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm in the absence of agonist stimulation, whereas it translocated rapidly to plasma membrane and colocalized with DOR upon challenge with DPDPE. The real-time recording of GRK2-GFP confocal fluorescence images in living cells co-expressing GRK2-GFP and the wild-type DOR showed that, in response to agonist challenge, the membrane-associated GRK2-GFP fluorescence increased quickly, whereas the cytoplasmic GRK2-GFP fluorescence decreased. This redistribution was accompanied by apparent changes in membrane shape (data not shown). However, agonist-induced GRK2-GFP translocation to cellular membranes was impaired in the cells co-expressing Δ31, the mutant receptor incapable of binding GRK2 and of being phosphorylated (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal domain of DOR is required not only for agonist-stimulated GRK2-receptor binding but also for agonist-stimulated GRK2 membrane localization.The agonist-induced membrane translocation of GRK2 precedes GPCR phosphorylation. Earlier studies from Loh and co-workers (23Kouhen O.M. Wang G. Solberg J. Erickson L.J. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36659-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and our group (19Guo J. Wu Y.L. Zhang W.B. Zhao J. Devi L.A. Pei G. Ma L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) revealed that GRK-related phosphorylation sites (Thr358 and Ser363) are within the carboxyl-terminal 31 amino acid residues of DOR (19Guo J. Wu Y.L. Zhang W.B. Zhao J. Devi L.A. Pei G. Ma L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Kouhen O.M. Wang G. Solberg J. Erickson L.J. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36659-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, DOR M3, in which all of the serine and threonine phosphorylation sites in GRK have been replaced by alanines, failed to be phosphorylated following treatment with DPDPE. The E355Q and D364N mutants of DOR bearing single point mutations at the acidic residues adjacent to two GRK phosphorylation sites (Thr358 and Ser363) showed greatly impaired phosphorylation, and a double mutant (E355Q/D364N) completely blocked receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Over-expression of GRK2 partially rescued the impaired phosphorylation capability of E355Q and D364N, but it did not have any significant effect on E355Q/D364N (Fig. 2B). Ligand (data not shown) and [35S]GTPγS (Fig. 2B) binding experiments showed that these mutated receptors were able to bind agonists, be activated, and couple to G protein normally. Thus, the impaired phosphorylation of M3, E355Q, D364N, and E355Q/D364N is not likely to be due to a deficiency in receptor activation and signaling. Furthermore, the E355Q/D364N double mutant as well as mutation of all the GRK phosphorylation sites on DOR resulted in remarkable inhibition of agonist-induced receptor desensitization (Fig. 2B). The above results indicate that the acidic residues near receptor phosphorylation sites play a critical role in GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation.Fig. 2Interaction of GRK2 with membrane-bound DOR is required for stable GRK2 membrane localization. HEK293 cells were transfected with WT, E355Q, D364N, E355Q/E364N, or M3 cDNA alone or co-transfected with or without GRK2 cDNA as indicated and harvested 48 h post transfection.

As shown in Fig. 1C, DPDPE treatment stimulated membrane redistribution of GRK2-GFP in the cells expressing M3, which lacks all of the GRK phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, the level of GRK2 membrane translocation was comparable with that in the cells expressing wild-type DOR. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that in response to opioid agonist stimulation, M3 interacted with GRK2 as efficiently as the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2, C and D), although it could not be phosphorylated (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, DPDPE-stimulated GRK2 membrane association and colocalization with the opioid receptor was entirely blocked in cells expressing the E355Q/D364N double mutant (Fig. 1C). Both the E355Q and D364N mutant showed a 50–60% reduction in agonist-induced GRK2 binding in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, whereas the E355Q/D364N double mutant showed a total loss of activity in this assay (Fig. 2, C and D). The above results indicate that those GRK serine and threonine phosphorylation sites on DOR are not critically involved in the interaction with GRK2 and in the membrane association of GRK2 induced by agonist. In contrast, the glutamic and aspartic acid residues near these phosphorylation sites are critical. The data also hint that the GRK2-DOR interaction is required not only for DOR phosphorylation but also for stable GRK2 membrane localization.Fig. 2Interaction of GRK2 with membrane-bound DOR is required for stable GRK2 membrane localization.

Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The protected digestion site is located on the loop connecting the A domain and the M3 transmembrane helix. We studied by mutational analysis the protective effect of AMP-PCP, an ATP analog that is not utilized for enzyme phosphorylation. We found that the nucleotide protective effect is interfered with by single mutations of Arg-560 and Glu-439 in the N domain and Lys-352, Lys-684, Thr-353, Asp-703, and Asp-707 in the P domain. This is consistent with a transition from the open to the compact configuration of the ATPase headpiece and approximation of the N and P domains by interactions with the nucleotide adenosine and phosphate moieties, respectively. The A domain-M3 loop is consequently involved. Protection by nucleotide substrate increased following the mutations of Asp-351 (the residue undergoing phosphorylation by ATP) and neighboring Asn-706 to Ala, underlying the importance of side chain specificity in positioning the nucleotide terminal phosphate and limiting the stability of the substrate-enzyme complex. Protection is not observed when AMP-PCP is added in the absence of Ca2+ or following mutations (E771Q or N796A) that interfere with Ca2+ binding. Therefore, nucleotide binds to the Ca2+-activated enzyme in the open headpiece conformation and the consequent approximation of the N and P domains occurs while the transmembrane domain is still in the Ca2+-bound conformation.

ATPase is a 110-kDa enzyme that utilizes 1 mol of ATP for active transport of two calcium ions in exchange for 2 mol of protons. The catalytic cycle begins with cooperative binding of two calcium ions from the cytosolic medium followed by ATP utilization and formation of a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate. The bound calcium is then released onto the luminal side of the SR, and the cycle is completed by hydrolytic cleavage of acylphosphate. The ATPase molecular structure includes a transmembrane region made of 10 clustered helical segments including the Ca2+ binding domain and a cytosolic headpiece including the nucleotide binding (N), phosphorylation (P), and actuator (A) domains. Structural studies have shown that if crystallization is performed in the presence of Ca2+ the three headpiece domains are distinctly separate in an open configuration (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the absence of Ca2+, those domains gather to form a compact headpiece (3Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 4Zhang P Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that in solution the three domains undergo fluctuations, yielding different enzyme conformations depending on the presence of specific ligands. Taking advantage of a selective ATPase cleavage (5Champeil P. Menguy T. Soulie‘ S. Juul B. Gomez de Grazia A. Rusconi P. Falson P. Denoroy L. Henao F. le Maire M. Moller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6619-6631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it was then shown that the addition of nucleotides in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+ protects the ATPase from digestion by proteinase K (1Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Protection was attributed to a change in the positions of the headpiece domains with respect to the loop connecting the A domain to the transmembrane helices. These movements are directly related to gate opening and closing in the Ca2+ pathway. This is a very important finding, suggesting that the open headpiece of the Ca2+-activated enzyme acquires a compact conformation upon substrate binding. We describe here a series of experiments on the interference of various mutations with the protective effect of nucleotide. We demonstrate that occurrence of the nucleotide-dependent conformational change requires participation of amino acid residues in both N and P domains and that nucleotide-dependent approximation of the headpiece domains occurs only when both Ca2+ sites are filled. SR vesicles were obtained with the microsomal fraction of rabbit leg muscle homogenate as described by Eletr and Inesi (6Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Recombinant ATPase was obtained by exogenous gene expression in COS-1 cells infected with adenovirus vectors carrying chicken WT or mutant SERCA1 cDNA (7Karin N.J. Kaprelian Z. Fambrough D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1978-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Adenovirus vector construction, site-directed mutations, COS-1 cells culture methods, and preparation of microsomal fractions were previously described in detail (8Zhang Z. Lewis D. Strock C. Inesi G. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8758-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured using bicinchoninic acid with the biuret reaction (Pierce). ATPase hydrolytic activity was determined following Pi production by a colorimetric method (9Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L J. Reinsch P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Experiments on limited digestion of ATPase with proteinase K and protection by nucleotides or Ca2+ were performed in media containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 50 mm NaCl in the presence or in the absence (CDTA or EGTA present) of 5 mm MgCl2 and/or 0.1 mm CaCl2. In experiments with native SR vesicles, the protein concentrations were 0.3 mg of SR and 0.01 mg of proteinase K/ml. In experiments with recombinant ATPase, the protein concentrations were 1.2 mg of microsomal protein and 0.04 mg of proteinase K/ml. The concentration of recombinant ATPase was adjusted to the same level in all of the experiments based on ATPase estimates by Western blotting and compensation with empty microsomes. The reaction was quenched at serial times by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to yield a final 2.5% concentration. The quenched protein was then solubilized by adding sodium dodecyl sulfate (1%), Tris (0.312 m), pH 6.8, sucrose (3.75%), β-mercaptoethanol (1.25 mm), and bromphenol blue (0.025%). The samples were then subjected to electrophoretic analysis (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206251) Google Scholar) on 12.5% gels followed by staining with Coomassie Blue or Western blotting. For this purpose, the monoclonal antibody mAb CaF3–5C3 to the chicken SERCA-1 protein and goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used followed by densitometry of the bands visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence-linked detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Amino acid sequencing of peptide fragments eluted from electrophoretic gels was performed at Johns Hopkins University. Nucleotide and Divalent Cation Protection of ATPase from Digestion by Proteinase K—Electrophoretic analysis (Fig. 1A) shows that limited digestion of ATPase with proteinase K yields a different pattern depending on the absence (EGTA present) or the presence of Ca2+. In fact, whereas 95- and 83-kDa proteolytic products are obtained in the absence of Ca2+, the 95-kDa band is not observed in the presence of Ca2+. Amino acid sequencing demonstrates that these fragments are produced by cleavage at Leu-119 and Thr-242, respectively. Therefore, the pattern shown in Fig. 1 indicates that Ca2+ binding protects the Leu-119 site while leaving the Thr-242 site accessible to proteinase K. On the other hand, in agreement with Danko et al. (1Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we found that ATP or AMP-PCP protects the enzyme from proteinase K digestion at the Thr-242 site (Fig. 1). Protection by nucleotide occurs in the presence of Ca2+ but not in the absence of Ca2+, and the overall protection of the ATPase band by nucleotide and Ca2+ is much more effective than that of Ca2+ alone (Fig 1B). It is of interest that while ADP has still a protective effect, AMPCP (i.e. ADP analog) does not (does not shown), suggesting a role of the oxygen atom between the α- and β-phosphate for substrate stabilization at the catalytic site. As a preliminary to mutational analysis, we confirmed that identical results are obtained with recombinant ATPase. Because the microsomal preparations derived from COS-1 cells contain several additional proteins, the digestion products of recombinant ATPase were evidenced by Western blotting, which is favored by their reactivity to the same antibody. In fact, since unrelated protein bands are not detected by Western blotting, the results of proteinase K digestion and the protection by AMP-PCP can be demonstrated quite clearly (Fig. 2). Effects of Site-directed Mutations—Considering that protection from proteinase K digestion is produced by functionally relevant ligands such as Ca2+ and nucleotide, we studied the effects of site-directed mutations that may interfere with binding and/or utilization of such ligands for catalytic reactions. A list of mutants produced for these experiments is shown in Table I. It is also shown in Table I that most mutants were expressed at levels nearly as high as those obtained with WT protein. Few mutants such as D703A and D707A were expressed at lower levels, perhaps because of defective folding of the nascent peptide. Generally, the digestion of mutants by proteinase K proceeded somewhat faster than digestion of WT ATPase as shown by the half-time of disappearance of the main ATPase band (Table I). This was more pronounced as a consequence of D707A and the K684A mutations and may be due to some folding destabilization by the mutations.Table IHalf-time for disappearance of ATPase band with and without AMP-PCPMutantsDomainWestern blotATPase activity (correction by WB)(t 1/2) without AMP-PCP(t 1/2) with AMP-PCPAMP-PCP effectratiominmin% wtWT1.001.0038.4382.15100N796ACa2+1.000.068.789.9311E771QCa2+1.060.0817.8018.590R560AN0.870.2421.3821.910E439AN0.470.5720.4820.100E439QN0.820.5520.3530.6545R489AN0.440.3419.0384.32300R489EN0.930.4120.4846.33120D351NP0.480.0815.1234.93115D351AP0.410.1918.77K352AP0.640.1514.8615.890K352EP0.550.128.7413.6449T353AP0.510.6022.7230.2629D703AP0.240.0922.6524.440.1N706AP0.630.1332.59D707AP0.190.121.281.7532K684AP1.090.062.242.380.1 Open table in a new tab Mutations of Residues Involved in Ca2 + Binding—The specific Ca2+ requirement for protection by AMP-PCP was most convincingly demonstrated by the use of the E771Q and N796A mutants. Consistent with inhibition of specific Ca2+ binding (11Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), we found that these mutations interfere also with AMP-PCP protection of ATPase digestion by proteinase K (Fig. 3 and Table I). It is of interest that protection by AMP-PCP is totally abolished by a mutation that interferes with the binding of only one Ca2+ (i.e. N796A) as well as by a mutation that interferes with the binding of both Ca2+ (i.e. E771Q). Because it is known that enzyme activation requires the binding of both Ca2+, it is apparent that protection by nucleotide requires specific enzyme activation by Ca2+. Mutations of Residues in the N Domain—We recently found that mutation of Arg-560 to Ala produces strong inhibition of ATP utilization but much less inhibition of reverse enzyme phosphorylation with Pi (12Hua S.H. Ma H. Lewis D. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2264-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We find now that the R560A mutation interferes completely with AMP-PCP protection of the enzyme from digestion with proteinase K (Fig. 4 and Table I). These combined observations indicate that the Arg-560 side chain is specifically involved in the stabilization of nucleotide in the N domain. Because of their proximity to the nucleotide binding site, we also characterized the effects of Glu-439 and Arg-489 mutations. We found partial catalytic inhibition as a consequence of their mutations, but interference with the AMP-PCP-protective effect was observed only in the E439A mutant (Table I). Considering that the bound nucleotide must reach the P domain to be utilized as a catalytic substrate and that nucleotide protection form proteinase K may be related to N and P domain approximation, we extended our mutational analysis to the P domain. Mutations of Residues in the P Domain—Ca2+-dependent utilization of ATP results in phosphorylation of Asp-351 to form a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate. Therefore, mutation of this residue results in complete enzyme inactivation. On the other hand, AMP-PCP protection from proteinase K digestion is retained following mutation of Asp-351 to Asn (Table I) and is actually much improved by mutation of Asp-351 to Ala (Fig. 5) or Asn-706 to Ala (Table I). The behavior of the Asp-351 mutant in conjunction with the effect of the AMP-PCP pseudo substrate demonstrates unambiguously that phosphoryl transfer is not required for the protective effect, but simple nucleotide binding is effective. In addition, the greater protection observed with the D351A and N706A mutants indicates that the native side chains of these amino acids play a role in positioning the nucleotide γ-phosphate and limiting the stability of the substrate-enzyme complex. In fact, a rather weak substrate-enzyme complex, relative to the subsequent transition state, is required for optimal enzyme kinetics. It was previously reported that Lys-684, a P domain residue, reacts with adenosine triphosphate pyridoxal in the presence of Ca2+, and this reaction is blocked by ATP (13Yamamoto H. Tagaya M. Fukui T. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that mutation of neighboring Lys-684 to Ala produces catalytic inactivation as well as interference with the protective effect of AMP-PCP (Table I). It is then apparent that the Lys-684 side chain plays an important and direct role in stabilization of the nucleotide substrate terminal phosphate. We also found that mutations of Lys-352, Thr-353, Asp-703, and Asp-707 produce total or partial catalytic inactivation and interfere with the protective effect of AMP-PCP (Table I). All of these residues reside in close proximity of the phosphorylation site (i.e. Asp-351). Analogous mutational analysis of the Na+K+-ATPase (14Pedersen P.A. Jorgensen J.R. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37588-37595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) indicates that electrostatic interactions around the phosphorylation site may play an important role in substrate positioning and utilization. We considered that their mutation may alter direct interactions with the nucleotide terminal phosphate or ligation of Mg2+ in conjunction with oxygen atoms of the ATP-terminal phosphate. On the other hand, the K352E mutation is not as effective as the K352A mutation. Furthermore, Mg2+ is not required for the nucleotide-protective effect (see below). Divalent Cation Specificity and Nucleotide Concentration Dependence—It is shown in Fig. 6A that the protective effect of AMP-PCP is obtained to the same extent, even when Mg2+ is omitted (CDTA present), and Ca2+ is present at concentrations (20–100 μm) that are much lower than the effective nucleotide concentrations (1 mm). We also found that irrespective of the presence or the absence of Mg2+ the protective effect occurs at 0.1–1.0 mm nucleotide concentrations. This range is higher than the 10 micromolar K m observed with ATP as a substrate for ATPase activity. It is of interest that the concentration dependence of the protective effect of AMP-PCP shifts to a lower range when the D351A mutant is used (Fig. 6B). A high affinity of the D351A mutant for the nucleotide substrate was previously noted by McIntosh et al. (15McIntosh D.B. Wooley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25227-25236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Definition of the SR ATPase crystal structure (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 3Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) has been a major step in the understanding of this enzyme. With regard to nucleotide binding to the ATPase, studies of crystals soaked with TNP-AMP (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar) revealed that the adenosine moiety is located within a flap of the N domain near the Phe-487, Lys-492, and Lys-515 and Arg-560 residues whose derivatization or mutation interferes with nucleotide binding (12Hua S.H. Ma H. Lewis D. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2264-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Murphy A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; : 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Mitchison C. Wilderspin A. Trinnaman B.J. Green N.M. FEBS Lett. 1982; 146: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 18McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Berman M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5301-5309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yamagata K. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20930-20936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A recent model based on ATP-Fe2+ (replacing Mg2+) catalyzed oxidation and on the crystal structure of the ATPase in the E2(TG) state places the adenosine moiety in a pocket delimited by Leu-492 and Lys-515 with stabilization provided by Arg-560 (21Hua S. Inesi G. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11405-11410Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The ATP-Mg complex is in a folded configuration with Mg2+ stabilized by α- and β-phosphate oxygen atoms and by the Thr-441 side chain (N domain), whereas the β-phosphate approximates Thr-353 (P domain) and the γ-phosphate approximates Asn-359 and Asp-601 (hinge region). However, although this arrangement may result from early collision of the ATP-Mg complex with the ATPase open conformation, the geometry of ATP must then be altered to place its terminal phosphate near Asp-351 (P domain) so that phosphoryl transfer to this residue can take place. Useful information on this subject was provided by studies on nucleotide-induced protection of the ATPase from digestion with proteinase K. The digestion site is at Thr-242 located on the loop connecting the A domain to the M3 helix. Thus, the susceptibility is expected to be affected by the position of the A domain. In fact, this is an isolated loop in E1 Ca2+ (open configuration) but is attached to the P domain in E2(TG) (compact configuration), reflecting the different configuration of the cytoplasmic domains. Steric hindrance by the P domain appears to be the origin of the protection of this site in the E2(TG) state. However, different degrees of protection from proteolysis are observed in the E2(TG), CaE1ATP, and E2P states (even though the headpiece resides in a compact configuration in all of these states), reflecting a graded response of the A domain to these ligand-induced transitions (1Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our mutational analysis indicates that Arg-560 and Glu-439 (N domain) as well as Asp-351, Lys-352, Thr-353, Lys-684, Asp-703, Asn-706, and Asp-707 (P domain) are involved in the nucleotide effect. Participation of N and P residues demonstrates that approximation of the two domains does indeed occur as required to accommodate the nucleotide by means of adenosine moiety interaction with the N domain and phosphate interaction with the P domain. The A domain must also reposition as shown by the protection from proteinase K. The Ca2+ requirement for nucleotide protection indicates that even though a compact arrangement of the headpiece is favored by nucleotide binding, the transmembrane domain retains bound Ca2+. The compact headpiece conformation obtained under these conditions is not identical to that observed in the absence of Ca2+ (1Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) but evidently represents an additional specific state produced by nucleotide binding on the Ca2+-activated enzyme. An apparently similar approximation of nucleotide binding (“fingers”) and catalytic (“palm”) domains is known to occur in DNA polymerases (22Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). It is of interest that the nucleotide concentration dependence of the protective effect is in the 0.1–1.0 mm range. This range is higher than the 10 μm K m observed with ATP as a substrate for ATPase activity, suggesting that the kinetics of catalytic ATP utilization have a significant influence on the overall ATP concentration dependence of enzyme activity. It should be pointed out that a rather weak substrate-enzyme complex, relative to the stability of the subsequent transition state, is required for effective enzyme kinetics. An additional finding is the lack of Mg2+ requirement for nucleotide protection of ATPase digestion by proteinase K (Fig. 6A). It is of interest that in structural snapshots (23Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jankaric J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grogoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) of the phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPase) (its catalytic domain is analogous to the P domain of Ca2+ATPase) reaction cycle, the initial substrate-enzyme complex does not include Mg2+, whereas interaction with Mg2+ occurs in concomitance with the phosphoryl transfer and hydrolytic reactions. With regard to the Ca2+ATPase, it is probable that a complex with Mg2+ is formed initially (21Hua S. Inesi G. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11405-11410Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) when ATP is the substrate due to the cation binding property of the nucleotide. On the other hand, our present experiments suggest that nucleotide binding (and its conformational effect) can be obtained either in the presence or in the absence of Mg2+, although the subsequent phosphoryl transfer and hydrolytic reactions require Mg2+ in analogy to PSPase. This suggestion is consistent with the random mechanism proposed by Reinstein and Jencks (24Reinstein J. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6632-6642Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) for ATP and Mg2+ binding to the Ca2+ATPase. In analogy to the PSPase, it is likely that catalytically required Mg2+ binding occurs in concomitance with the phosphorylation transition state, including coordination by Asp-703, Thr-353, and γ-phosphate. Mutational analysis demonstrates direct roles of Arg-560 (N domain) and Lys-684 in nucleotide stabilization in the N and P domains, respectively. Arg-560 may interact with the nucleotide α-phosphate. Lys-684, on the other hand, is likely to interact with γ-phosphate in analogy to stabilization of phosphorylserine by Lys-144 in the PSPase (23Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jankaric J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grogoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The roles of other residues are more complex. For instance, the absence of nucleotide protection in the Asp-703 mutant could be attributed to a role of this residue in Mg2+ stabilization. On the other hand, nucleotide protection is obtained even in the absence of Mg2+. Therefore, Asp-703 must have an additional and important role in structural stabilization by hydrogen bonding with neighboring residues. Similar considerations can be made regarding Asp-707, Lys-352, and Thr-353, whose side chains are likely to establish hydrogen bonding with neighboring residues and/or water molecules (23Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jankaric J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grogoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Note that the K352A mutation is much more effective than the K352E mutation, indicating that the ability of K352 to establish stabilizing interactions in the open or compact headpiece conformation is more important than a possible interaction with γ-phosphate oxygen atoms. Another interesting finding is related to the higher protective effect of nucleotide in the D351A and N706A mutants as compared with WT Asp-351 and Asp-706 (as well as with the D351N mutant). Asp-351 is in fact the residue undergoing phosphorylation, and Asn-706 (Asn-170 in the PSPase) is a close neighbor that contributes its side chain nitrogen (3Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 23Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jankaric J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grogoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) for coordination of the same γ-phosphate oxygen as Lys-684 (Lys-144 in the PSPase). It is then apparent that in the WT enzyme, a number of steric and electrostatic constraints guide the γ-phosphate to an optimal position for covalent interaction. On the other hand, even tighter binding may be obtained by removing some of these constraints. To understand our experimental results, an atomic model was built based on the atomic model of the PSPase with its substrate bound (23Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jankaric J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grogoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This was possible because of the close similarity between the atomic structures of the catalytic domain of the PSPase and the P domain of the MgFx complex of the Ca2+ATPase (considered to be an E-P analog). 2C. Toyoshima, unpublished observations. The model for the Ca2+ATPase was built combining that for the N domain taken from the E2(TG) form (Protein Data Bank code 1IWO) (3Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) and that for the P domain from the MgFx complex. ATP in an extended form was placed so that the γ-phosphate comes exactly to the same position as that of the phosphate in phosphoserine (Protein Data Bank code 1L7P). The ATP orientation in the model (Fig. 7) suggests that Mg2+ coordinated by the β- and γ-phosphates would not come to a position suitable for coordination by Asp-703. In fact, in the D11N mutant of the PSPase (corresponding to the D351N mutant of the Ca2+ATPase and used for the substrate bound state), no Mg2+ is found as opposed to the subsequent states of the catalytic cycle in which Asp-167 (Asp-703 in the Ca2+ATPase) participates. This clearly indicates that the initial step of substrate binding does not require Mg2+, consistent with the observation that Mg2+ is not required for the nucleotide-induced protection from proteinase K digestion of the Ca2+ATPase. In the D11N mutant of the PSPase, the conformation of Asn-11 is different from other states. The conformation of Asn-11 is one of the standard rotamers and places the side chain nitrogen atom close to the phosphate. This conformation is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between oxygen atom of Asn-11 and main chain amide of Asp-167 (Asp-703 in Ca2+ATPase). Thus, this is likely to be the conformation in the native enzyme when substrates bind initially. Here phosphates are coordinated by atoms corresponding to Lys-352 (main chain NH), Thr-353 (main chain NH), Thr-625 (Oγ1), Gly-626 (main chain NH), Lys-684 (Nζ), and Asn-706 (Nδ2) in the Ca2+ATPase. Thus Lys-684 is the only positively charged residue likely to be a key attractor for the γ-phosphate. Hence the position of the side chain nitrogen atom must be very important. In fact, in phosphoglucomutase (25Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8351-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Science. 2003; 299: 2067-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), the Cα position of the corresponding residue is different by one residue but the position of the nitrogen atom is exactly the same. This position appears to be controlled by Asp-351 and Asp-707 in the Ca2+ATPase when substrates are absent. Thus, mutations of these residues may strongly affect the affinity for ATP and consequently its protective effect. This may explain the higher protection observed with the D351A as compared with the D351N mutant. The effect of the N706A mutant is particularly interesting. N706 in the MgFx complex of the Ca2+ATPase as well as the corresponding Asn-170 in the PSPase provides a nitrogen atom for coordination of the same phosphate oxygen as Lys-684. Thus, the strong nucleotide protection observed in the N706A mutant was contrary to our expectation. Although this Asn residue is not well conserved in the haloacid dehologenase superfamily, the corresponding residue (Asn-170) of the PSPase is involved in a large conformation change and appears to regulate the flap (or lid) of the substrate binding site by changing the interaction with Phe-49 in the subdomain. Asn-706 may bear a similar role and might adjust the position of the N or A domain. At least in the MgFx complex, this residue does interact with the key loop in the A domain (181TGES184) or it may have an influence on the position of Lys-684. If mutated to Ala, Lys-684 might take a position that allows stronger interaction with ATP. This may be a likely reason for the strong nucleotide protection observed in the Asn-706 mutant. Finally, it should be pointed out that in the model (Fig. 7) Arg-560 takes a very strategic position. It stabilizes ATP by interacting with the α-phosphate and also stabilizes the closed configuration of the N and P domains by making a salt bridge with Asp-627, one of the critical residues in the P domain. In this sense, Arg-560 may have a similar role to Arg-56 in the PSPase. Why Asp-627 is important has never been explained. This conformation of Asp-627 is realized by an interaction with Lys-352, which appears to serve also in positioning Thr-353, another critical residue. This may be the reason for the profound effect of the K352A mutation. In conclusion, our experiments indicate that nucleotide binding occurs by collision with the N domain in the Ca2+-dependent open conformation of the enzyme headpiece. A substrate-induced conformational fit then takes place relative to stabilization of the headpiece domains in a compact configuration. This allows approximation of the ATP γ-phosphate to Asp-351 in the P domain, whereas the membrane-bound domain still binds two Ca2+. The roles of several amino acid residues are demonstrated, in some cases related to direct substrate binding and in other cases related to short and long range interactions of protein structure."

Understanding the regulatory checkpoints involved in safeguarding non-apoptotic cells against accidental activation of this nuclease is as important as elucidating its activation mechanisms during apoptosis. Here we address these issues by determining DFF native subunit structures and stoichiometries in human cells before and after induction of apoptosis using the technique of native pore-exclusion limit electrophoresis in combination with Western analyses. For comparison, we employed similar techniques with recombinant proteins in conjunction with atomic force microscopy. Before induction of apoptosis, the expression of DFF subunits varied widely among the cell types studied, and the chaperone/inhibitor subunits DFF45 and DFF35 unexpectedly existed primarily as monomers in vast excess of the latent nuclease subunit, DFF40, which was stoichiometrically associated with DFF45 to form heterodimers. DFF35 was exclusively cytoplasmic as a monomer. Nuclease activation upon caspase-3 cleavage of DFF45/DFF35 was accompanied by DFF40 homo-oligomer formation, with a tetramer being the smallest unit. Interestingly, intact DFF45 can inhibit nuclease activity by associating with these homo-oligomers without mediating their disassembly. We conclude that DFF nuclease is regulated by multiple pre- and post-activation fail-safe steps.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a fundamental process essential for both development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis (for review, see Refs. 1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar and 2Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar). Two major apoptotic pathways exist, the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway (3Green D.R.

Multiple apoptotic stimuli, which include activation of Fas receptors, serum starvation, ionizing radiation, or various drugs that target DNA, trigger the activation of proteases called caspases, which in turn initiate and execute the apoptotic program (5Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). One of the hallmarks of the terminal stages of apoptosis is DNA breakdown, which has functional significance (6Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4153) Google Scholar, 7Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 66-77Crossref Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 8Nagata S. Exp.

Although cell death can occur without significant DNA degradation, cell-autonomous DNA breakdown of tumor or virally infected cells functionally prepares the resulting apoptotic corpses for engulfment by phagocytes and as such eliminates the transforming potential of any hazardous oncogenes. Interestingly, patients or an animal model with defective apoptotic DNA processing have a predisposition to auto-immune disease, which is known to be associated with the appearance of anti-DNA and anti-nucleosomal antibodies (10Yasutomo K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 313-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 11Nupirei M. Karsunky H. Zevnik B. Stephan H. Mannherz H.G. Möröy T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Finally, the execution of apoptotic DNA fragmentation and the cell death program appears to be reversible at a low frequency, and under such conditions chromosomal translocations mediated by non-homologous end joining of proto-oncogenes are thought to be one mechanism of cellular transformation (12Betti C.J. Villalobos M.J. Diaz M.O. Vaughan A.T.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4550-4555PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, it is well documented that treatment of leukemias with proapoptotic drugs, which target DNA, can lead to secondary tumors that exhibit new chromosomal translocations (13Roulston D. Espinosa III, R. Nucifora G. Larson R.A. Le Beau M.M. Rowley J.D. Blood. 1998; 92: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, it seems clear that understanding the regulation of proteins that are involved in DNA processing events during apoptosis is of fundamental importance, as well as how these processes are safeguarded from accidental activation in non-apoptotic cells. In the current study we address these issues for a major apoptotic nuclease complex, termed DFF. 1The abbreviations used are: DFF, DNA fragmentation factor; AFM, atomic force microscopy; CAD, caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (also termed DFF40); DFF45, 45-kDa subunit of DFF; DFF40, 40-kDa subunit of DFF; DFF35, 35-kD subunit of DFF; ICAD-L and ICAD-S, inhibitors of CAD, long and short forms (also termed DFF45 and DFF35, respectively); CPAN, caspase-activated nuclease (also termed DFF40 and CAD). Apoptotic cell genomic DNA cleavage is known to occur in at least two stages, initial cleavage at ≥50-kilobase intervals, a size consistent with chromatin loop domains, followed by a second stage of internucleosomal DNA cleavage (also called DNA laddering) (14Oberhammer F.

In non-apoptotic cells, DFF is thought to exist as a heterodimer, composed of a 45-kDa chaperone and inhibitor subunit (DFF45/ICAD-L), and a 40-kDa latent nuclease subunit (DFF40/CAD/CPAN) (21Liu X.

Two proteins encoded by genes called CIDEs (cell death-inducing DFF45-like effectors) that exhibit homology to the N-terminal domain of DFF45 can activate apoptosis in a DFF45-inhibitable fashion, but their precise functions and mechanisms of action remain to be elucidated (43Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the physiological significance of DFF in triggering DNA laddering during apoptosis has been unequivocally proven. Homozygous deletions of the single copy genes encoding DFF45 or DFF40 have been created in the mouse germ line and in cultured chicken cells (44Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Kaer L.V. Wang X. Xu M.

Significantly, cells engineered in each of these ways exhibit greatly reduced DNA laddering when exposed to several apoptotic stimuli, both in vivo and in vitro, proving that DFF is a principal mediator of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (18Sakahira H.

Perhaps unexpected, initial characterization of such knockout mice has not revealed any obvious developmental or immune system defects (44Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. Kaer L.V. Wang X. Xu M. Proc.

Brain Res. 2000; 867: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, further investigation has uncovered that during apoptosis DFF-deficient cells are efficiently killed and engulfed by macrophages, which through the action of lysosomal DNase II degrade the DNA of the ingested corpses (46Kawane K. Fukuyama H. Yoshida H. Nagase H. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Okada K. Iida T. Nagata S. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 47McIlroy D. Tanaka M. Sakahira H. Fukuyama H. Suzuki M. Yamamura K. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 549-558PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, DFF40/DNase II double knockout mice exhibit a severe defect in thymic development (46Kawane K. Fukuyama H. Yoshida H. Nagase H. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Okada K. Iida T. Nagata S. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In conclusion, it is well established experimentally that DFF plays a major and regulated role in cell-autonomous apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Developing an understanding of the steps involved in safe-guarding normal cells against accidental activation of this nuclease is as important as elucidating its activation mechanisms during apoptosis. To gain insight on the regulation of these processes, in the present study we have determined the native subunit structures and stoichiometries of these proteins before and after induction of apoptosis using the technique of native pore-exclusion limit electrophoresis in combination with Western analyses (50Clos J. Westwood J.T. Becker P.B. Wilson S. Lambert K. Wu C. Cell. 1990; 63: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and have utilized similar techniques with recombinant proteins along with atomic force microscopy. We find that DFF activation is regulated by multiple fail-safe steps and that its inhibitory subunits unexpectedly are expressed at vast stoichiometric excess relative to its latent nuclease subunit in several tumor cells studied. Expression, Purification, Activation, and Inhibition of Recombinant Forms of DFF—His6-tagged human recombinant DFF40/DFF45 heterodimer, human recombinant DFF45 monomer, and hamster recombinant caspase-3 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using nickel affinity columns as described previously (22Liu X.

DFF40/DFF45 heterodimer was incubated with caspase-3 at room temperature in reaction buffer consisting of 10 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After 30 min of incubation caspase-3 was inhibited with 10 μm acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde. In some experiments fresh DFF45 (10-fold molar excess as compared with the starting DFF40/DFF45 heterodimer concentration) was then added, and the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for an additional 15 min. Nuclease activity was assayed as described previously (27Widlak P. Li P. Wang X. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8226-8232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Treatments—Several established human cell lines were used for experiments: HL60 and K562 myeloid leukemia cells (DSMZ ACC 107 and EC ACC 89121407, respectively), Jurkat T cell leukemia cells (DSMC ACC 282), HeLa S3 cervical carcinoma cells (ATTC CC1 2.2), MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells (IZSBS BS TCL 37), A549 lung carcinoma cells (DSMZ ACC 107), and Me45 melanoma cells. As non-cancer cells, we used primary fibroblasts (passage 15), resting total lymphocytes (80% T cells), and proliferating T lymphocytes. Lymphocytes and leukemia cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium, whereas other cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, all supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Lymphocytes were freshly isolated from circulating blood by centrifugation on Ficoll Lymphoprep™ (ICN). To obtain proliferating T cells, isolated lymphocytes were incubated for 3 days in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 mg/liter lectin (Sigma). To induce apoptosis, HL60 cells were incubated for 5 h with 34 μm etoposide (Sigma). DNA fragmentation in such cells was assayed as described previously (51Widlak P. Palyvoda O. Kumala S. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21683-21690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Isolation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extracts—Cell growing in log phase were collected and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Washed cells were incubated for 15 min on ice in lysis buffer consisting of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors Complete™ (Roche Applied Science). After incubation, nuclei were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 600 × g. Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g, and the resulting supernatants are referred to as cytoplasmic extracts. In some experiments nuclei were obtained by a non-detergent lysis procedure in which HeLa cells washed with phosphate-buffered saline were suspended in the lysis buffer depleted of Nonidet P-40 and sucrose, incubated with 10 μm cytochalasin B for 15 min on ice, then lysed by passing 5 times through 25-gauge needles. Nuclei were washed with the lysis buffer depleted of Nonidet P-40 by low speed centrifugation and incubated for 15 min on ice in the nuclear extract buffer consisting of 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 200 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete™ (Roche Applied Science)). Nuclei were then centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g, and the resulting supernatants were referred to as nuclear extracts. Western Blot Analyses—Total cell protein (80 μg/lane) and the corresponding fractions of cytoplasmic extracts, nuclei and nuclear extracts, or protein from cytoplasmic extracts alone (50 μg/lane) were separated on SDS, 14% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences or Schleicher & Schuell). Membrane-immobilized proteins were probed with the following commercial antibodies: rabbit anti-human DFF40 polyclonal antibodies (Pharmingen or Axxora), rabbit anti-human DFF45 N terminus polyclonal antibodies (Pharmingen), rabbit anti-human DFF45 C terminus polyclonal antibodies (Axxora), and mouse anti-human β-actin monoclonal antibody (Oncogene). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western-blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Atomic Force Microscopy—Protein samples were diluted to a final concentration of ∼1 μg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Immediately before imaging, 2-μl aliquots of diluted protein samples were introduced to the surface of freshly cleaved mica and rinsed with 200 μl of H2O followed by dehydration using a graded series of ethanol solutions consisting of 20, 40, 80, and 100% ethanol. Images were collected under ambient conditions in tapping mode using a Nanoscope IIIa (Digital Instruments Inc., Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with a vertical engage J-scanner operated at a scan rate of 1.97 Hz. Volume data were calculated as previously described (52Smith G.C.M. Cary R.B. Lakin N.D. Hann B.C. Teo S. Chen D.J. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11134-11139Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Native Pore-exclusion Limit Electrophoresis—Native pore-exclusion limit electrophoresis was performed as described elsewhere (50Clos J. Westwood J.T. Becker P.B. Wilson S. Lambert K. Wu C. Cell. 1990; 63: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, soluble proteins from cytoplasmic extracts (300 μg of protein/lane) were separated on linear 4–24% gradient polyacrylamide gels in 0.1 m Tris borate, pH 9.5, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Gels were calibrated by co-electrophoresis of ovalbumin (45 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), with α-actin (monomer of actin G and a series of its oligomers) and also with Kaleidoscope pre-stained standards (Bio-Rad 161-0324). Electrophoresis was continued for 16 h at 300 V, ∼10 mA, at 4 °C. Gels were soaked with 0.1% SDS, 25 mm Tris-Cl, 250 mm glycine, pH 8.5, and then proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membrane-immobilized proteins were probed with antibodies as described above. In one experiment (in-gel DFF40 oligomerization) proteins from cytoplasmic extracts were electrophoresed briefly (∼1 cm) into a native 5% polyacrylamide gel, and the appropriate gel fragment was excised. The gel fragment was then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 10 μg of caspase-3, washed, and polymerized at the top of a 5–24% gradient gel. When cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis, protein were first separated on native gradient gel, the gel fragment was soaked in 2% SDS, 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and placed on the top of standard SDS-14% polyacrylamide gel. DFF Levels Vary Widely among Both Normal and Transformed Human Cells—Previous studies have noted varied expression of DFF45/35 and DFF40 among different human and mouse cell lines and tissues by Northern analyses of mRNA levels but not by Western analyses of protein levels (36Lechardeur D. Drzymala L. Sharma M. Zylka D. Kinach R. Pacia J. Hicks C. Usmani N. Rommens J.M. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 48Zhang J. Wang X. Bove K.E.

Because we were interested in determining the native subunit structures and relative stoichiometries of these proteins, it was first necessary to survey several cell sources to identify those that possessed adequate levels for subsequent analyses. For this purpose we performed Western analyses on suitably prepared cell extracts using antibodies specific for DFF40, DFF45 (with antibodies against the C terminus of DFF45), and both DFF45 and DFF35 (with antibodies against the N terminus of DFF45). As shown in Fig. 1, DFF species levels varied more than 10-fold between the cell sources studied, with levels undetectable in resting lymphocytes and A549 lung carcinoma cells, barely detectable in fibroblasts and stimulated lymphocytes, and quite robust in MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma, HeLa cervical carcinoma, and Jurkat, HL-60 and K562 leukemia cells. Thus, DFF levels in some tumor cells, but not others, far exceed the levels exhibited by normal cells. Whether there is any relationship between these differences in DFF levels and sensitivities to killing by various apoptotic stimuli remain to be determined. Nevertheless, based on these results, we selected Jurkat, HeLa, and HL-60 cells for further studies. By relating results on na"

In this work the regulation of the inducible mhp catabolic genes has been studied by genetic and biochemical approaches. The Pr and Pa promoters, which control the expression of the divergently transcribed mhpR regulatory gene and mhp catabolic genes, respectively, show a peculiar arrangement leading to transcripts that are complementary at their 5′-ends. By using Pr-lacZ and Pa-lacZ translational fusions and gel retardation assays, we have shown that the mhpR gene product behaves as a 3HPP-dependent activator of the Pa promoter, being the expression from Pr constitutive and MhpR-independent. DNase I footprinting experiments and mutational analysis mapped an MhpR-protected region, centered at position –58 with respect to the Pa transcription start site, which is indispensable for MhpR binding and in vivo activation of the Pa promoter. Superimposed in the specific MhpR-mediated regulation of the Pa promoter, we have observed a strict catabolite repression control carried out by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) that allows expression of the mhp catabolic genes when the preferred carbon source (glucose) is not available and 3HPP is present in the medium. Gel retardation assays revealed that the specific activator, MhpR, is essential for the binding of the second activator, CRP, to the Pa promoter. Such peculiar synergistic transcription activation has not yet been observed in other aromatic catabolic pathways, and the MhpR activator becomes the first member of the IclR family of transcriptional regulators that is indispensable for recruiting CRP to the target promoter.

Phenylpropanoic and phenylpropenoic acids and their hydroxylated derivatives are widely distributed in the environment, arising from digestion of aromatic amino acids or as breakdown products of lignin or other plant-derived phenylpropanoids and flavonoids. The bacterial catabolism of these aromatic compounds plays a key role in recycling of such carbon sources in the ecosystem (1Masai E. Harada K. Peng X. Kitayama H. Katayama Y. Fukuda M. Appl.

Commonly occurring hydroxycinnamates (caffeate, ferulate, coumarate, etc.) are catabolized via coenzyme A (CoA) derivatives and protocatechuate (2Smith M.A. Weaver V.B. Young D.M. Ornston L.N. Appl.

On the other hand, aerobic degradation of phenylpropionic acid, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (3HPP) 1The abbreviations used are: 3HPP, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid; CRP, cAMP receptor protein; OR, operator region; LB, Luria Bertani; Km, kanamycin.1The abbreviations used are: 3HPP, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid; CRP, cAMP receptor protein; OR, operator region; LB, Luria Bertani; Km, kanamycin. and 3-hydroxycinnamic acid usually involves an initial oxygenation step with formation of 2,3-dihydroxyphenylpropionate (2,3-dihydroxyphenylcinnamate) that is further degraded via a meta-cleavage hydrolytic pathway (5Burlingame R. Chapman P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 424-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These pathways have been described in different bacterial genera (Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Ralstonia, Acinetobacter, Comamonas, Escherichia, Rhodococcus) (5Burlingame R. Chapman P.J. J.

García J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2915-2923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 3HPP (and 3-hydroxycinnamic acid) degradation pathway from Escherichia coli is encoded by the mhp cluster located at min 8.0 of the genome, and it was the first HPP degradation pathway that was described both at the biochemical and genetic levels (5Burlingame R. Chapman P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 424-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ferrández A. García J.L. Díaz E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Burlingame R.P.

Rev. 2001; 65: 523-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The 3HPP pathway is initiated by the MhpA monooxygenase that transforms 3HPP into 2,3-dihydroxyphenylpropionate, which is then converted to succinate, pyruvate, and acetyl-CoA through the action of a meta-cleavage hydrolytic route that involves a dioxygenase (MhpB), hydrolase (MhpC), hydratase (MhpD), aldolase (MhpE), and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (MhpF) activity (5Burlingame R. Chapman P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 424-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Díaz E. Ferrández A. Prieto M.A. García J.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 523-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The mhp cluster is arranged as follows: (i) six catabolic genes encoding the initial monooxygenase (mhpA), the extradiol dioxygenase (mhpB), and the hydrolytic meta-cleavage enzymes (mhpCDFE); (ii) a gene (mhpT) that encodes a potential transporter; and (iii) a regulatory gene (mhpR) that is adjacent to the catabolic genes but transcribed in the opposite direction (Fig. 1) (14Ferrández A. García J.L. Díaz E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar gene arrangement has been observed in Klebsiella pneumoniae (17Díaz E. Ferrández A. Prieto M.A. García J.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 523-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The mhp cluster of Comamonas testosteroni TA441 also resembles that of E. coli (11Arai H. Yamamoto T. Ohishi T. Shimizu T. Nakata T. Kudo T. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2813-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the hpp and ohp clusters responsible for the partial catabolism of 3HPP and 2-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid in Rhodococcus globerulus PWD1 (13Barnes M.R. Duetz W.A. Williams P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6145-6153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Rhodococcus sp. V49 (12Powell J.A.C. Archer J.A.C. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1998; 74: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), respectively, show a different gene organization and low sequence similarity with the mhp clusters of Gram-negative bacteria (17Díaz E. Ferrández A. Prieto M.A. García J.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 523-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Despite a putative regulatory gene that has been identified in all HPP catabolic clusters described so far, there are no reports on the regulation of such clusters, with the exception of the mhpR gene product from E. coli that was shown to be a transcriptional activator of the mhp catabolic genes (Fig. 1) (14Ferrández A. García J.L. Díaz E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparison analyses revealed that the MhpR protein from E. coli belongs to the IclR family of regulatory proteins (14Ferrández A. García J.L. Díaz E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Díaz E. Ferrández A. Prieto M.A. García J.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 523-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Because other IclR-type regulators of aromatic catabolic pathways, i.e. PobR and PcaU of the 4-hydroxybenzoate and protocatechuate degradation in Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 (18DiMarco A.A. Averhoff B. Ornston L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4499-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gerischer U. Segura A. Ornston L.N. J.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5771-5779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Agrobacterium tume-faciens (21Parke D. FEMS Microbiol.

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1998; 74: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Eulberg D. Lakner S. Golovleva L.A. Schlömann M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1072-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are controlling ortho-cleavage pathways, the MhpR protein of E. coli becomes the first IclR-type regulator that is controlling the expression of a meta-cleavage pathway for degradation of aromatic compounds. On the other hand, there are no reports on the promoters driving expression of the genes involved in catabolism of HPP. Therefore, the mhp pathway from E. coli constitutes an interesting model system to study regulatory features of the catabolism of HPP in bacteria. In this work, we have used both genetic and biochemical approaches to study for the first time the transcriptional regulation of an HPP degradation pathway. Superimposed in the specific MhpR-dependent regulation of the mhp catabolic genes from E. coli, the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) acts as a mandatory activator that tightly adjusts the expression of the catabolic genes to the overall growth status of the cell. A peculiar synergistic transcription activation of the mhp genes by the specific MhpR activator and the CRP global regulator is described.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformation of E. coli was carried out using the RbCl method (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or by electroporation (Gene Pulser; Bio-Rad). DNA manipulations and other molecular biology techniques were essentially as described (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA fragments were purified using the Gene-Clean (BIO-101, Inc., Vista, CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Oligo-1000 M nucleotide synthesizer (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). Nucleotide sequences were determined directly from plasmids by using the dideoxy chain termination method (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Standard protocols of the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) were used for AmpliTaq FS DNA polymerase-initiated cycle sequencing reactions with fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotide terminators. The sequencing reactions were analyzed using an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Construction of E. coli Strains Harboring Chromosomal Insertions of the Pa-lacZ and Pr-lacZ Translational Fusions—By means of RP4-mediated mobilization, plasmids pUTRAL, pUTAL, and pUTRL (Table I, Fig. 2A), which contain mini-Tn5Km hybrid transposons expressing mhpR/Pa-lacZ, Pa-lacZ, and Pr-lacZ fusions, respectively, were transferred from E. coli S17–1λpir into different rifampicin-resistant E. coli recipient strains, i.e. AFMC and AFSB, through biparental filter mating as described previously (25de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Exconjugants containing the lacZ translational fusions stably inserted into the chromosome were selected for the transposon marker, kanamycin, on rifampicin-containing LB medium. The resulting strains, AFMCRAL, AFMCAL, AFMCRL, AFSBRAL, AFSBAL, and AFSBRL, and their relevant genotypes are indicated in Table I. Production of the MhpR Activator—The mhpR gene was expressed from the Plac promoter in the high copy number pPAL plasmid (Table I) and from the Ptrc promoter in the low copy number pBT18 plasmid (Table I). To prepare crude extracts containing the MhpR protein, MhpR+ extracts, E. coli DH5α (pPAL) cells were grown in ampicillin-containing LB medium to an A 600 of about 1. Cell cultures were then centrifuged (3,000 × g, 10 min at 20 °C), and cells were washed and resuspended in 0.05 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm KCl prior to disruption by passage through a French press (Aminco Corp.) operated at a pressure of 20,000 p.s.i. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 26,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The clear supernatant fluid was decanted and used as crude cell extract. The MhpR– extracts from E. coli DH5α (pUC18) cells were prepared in a similar manner. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence Determination—The amino-terminal sequence of MhpR was determined by Edman degradation with a 477A automated protein sequencer (Applied Biosystem Inc.). A crude extract of E. coli DH5α (pRL) cells was loaded in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the MhpR(100 amino acids)-LacZ(1016 amino acids) fusion protein encoded by plasmid pRL was directly electroblotted from the gel onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as previously described (33Speicher D.W. Methods. 1994; 6: 262-273Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Truncation of the MhpR Binding Motif—To delete one half-site of the MhpR binding motif (operator region, termed OR), plasmid pPAR (Table I) was linearized with the DraIII restriction enzyme and then treated with T4 DNA polymerase. The resulting plasmid, pPARΔop, was sequenced, and it was shown to harbor the PaΔop promoter that contains a modified OR region lacking one of its half-sites (9-bp deletion) (Fig. 7A). Synthesis of DNA Fragments Used as Probes—The target DNA fragments used as probes were generated by PCR using plasmid pRAL (Table I, Fig. 2) as template. To prepare the Pa-Pr fragment (274 bp), primers PP6 (5′-CCGTCTGCTCATTGTTCTG-3′, which encodes amino acids 2 to 8 of MhpR and hybridizes with the coding strand of the mhpR gene between nucleotides 831–849 of the mhp gene cluster (Fig. 1) (14Ferrández A. García J.L. Díaz E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and LAC-57 (5′-CGATTAAGTTGGGTAACGCCAGGG-3′, which hybridizes at 57 nucleotides downstream of the lacZ translational start codon), were used. To prepare the Pa fragment (134 bp), primers PP6 and PA3′(5′-GATTTTTTATTGTGCGCTCAG-3′, which hybridizes to the mhpA coding strand at the transcription start region of Pa, see Fig. 1), were used. To obtain the Pr fragment (156 bp), we have used the PR5′(5′-GCGCACAATAAAAAATCATTTAC-3′, which hybridizes to the mhpR coding strand at the transcription start region of Pr, see Fig. 1) and LAC-57 primers. The mhpR-Pa fragment (590 bp) was PCR-amplified by using the PP4 (5′-GGTCTTGTTCCGGGCAAAAGGC-3′, which hybridizes 438 nucleotides downstream of the ATG start codon of mhpR) and PA3′ primers. Finally, to prepare the PaΔop fragment (125 bp) we have used the PP6 and PA3′ primers and the pRALΔop plasmid (Table I) as template. Mapping Transcription Start Sites—E. coli DH5α (pRL) and DH5α (pRAL) cells were grown in LB medium in the presence of 1 mm 3HPP until the cultures reached an A 600 of about 1.0. Total RNA was isolated using the RNA/DNA Midi kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the supplier. Primer extension reactions were carried out with the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase as described previously (26Prieto M.A. García J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), using primers LAC-57 and PP6. To determine the length of the primer extension products, sequencing reactions of pRL and pRAL were carried out with the same primers, i.e. LAC-57 and PP6, by using the T7 sequencing kit and [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) as indicated by the supplier. Products were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide-urea gels. The gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). To confirm the start site(s) of the Pr promoter, total RNAs were used in a reverse transcription-PCR experiment. Whereas primers PP4 and PaTATA (5′-CGCTCAGTATAGGAAGGGTG-3′, which hybridizes 9 nucleotides downstream of the major transcription start site of Pr, see Fig. 1) amplified a 578-bp fragment, primers PP4 and Pr10 (5′-TTGTTAAAAACATGTAAATG-3′, which hybridizes 3 nucleotides upstream of the major transcription start site of Pr, see Fig. 1) did not amplify any fragment, which confirms the transcription start site(s) of Pr deduced from primer-extension analyses. Gel Retardation Assays—DNA fragments used as probes were labeled at their 5′-end with phage T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA probes were purified by the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Quiagen). The reaction mixtures contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 nm DNA probe, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml salmon sperm (competitor) DNA, and cell extract or purified CRP (kindly provided by A. Kolb) in a 20-μl final volume. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, mixtures were fractionated by electrophoresis in 4% polyacrylamide gels buffered with 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). The gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). DNase I Footprinting Assays—The Pa-Pr DNA fragment to be used as probe was singly 5′-end-labeled at the Pa non-coding strand by using a labeled primer during the PCR amplification reaction. The LAC-57 primer (50 pmol) was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. To perform the PCR reaction, 5 pmol of labeled and 7.5 pmol of unlabeled primers were used. The 5′-end-labeled PCR product was purified using the High Pure PCR product purification kit from Roche Applied Science. For DNase I footprinting assays, the reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 nm DNA probe, 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and cell extract in a 25-μl final volume. This mixture was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, after which 0.15 units of DNaseI (Amersham Biosciences) (prepared in 10 mm CaCl2, 50 mm MgCl2, 125 mm KCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was added and the incubation continued at 37 °C for 30 s. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 180 μl of a solution containing 0.4 m sodium acetate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 50 μg of tRNA/ml, and 5 μg of salmon DNA/ml. After phenol-chloroform extraction, DNA fragments were precipitated with ethanol absolute, washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and directly resuspended in 5 ml of 90% (v/v) formamide-loading gel buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol). Samples were then denatured at 95 °C for 2 min and fractionated in a 8% polyacrylamide-urea gel. A+G Maxam and Gilbert reactions (34Maxam A Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar) were carried out with the same fragments and loaded in the gels along with the footprinting samples. The gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to Hyperfilm MP. β-Galactosidase Assays—β-Galactosidase activities were measured with permeabilized cells as described by Miller (30Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). In vivo Characterization of the Pa and Pr Promoters and Their Specific Regulation—As mentioned above, the mhpR regulatory gene is transcribed in the opposite direction to that of the mhpABCDFE catabolic genes involved in 3HPP degradation in E. coli (Fig. 1). Therefore, the intergenic mhpR-mhpA region should contain the Pr and Pa promoters driving expression of the mhp regulatory and catabolic genes, respectively. Whereas the ATG translational start codon of the first catabolic gene (mhpA) has been identified, two potential start codons of the regulatory mhpR gene were proposed (14Ferrández A. García J.L. Díaz E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To define precisely the intergenic mhpR-mhpA region, we have determined the N-terminal amino acid sequence of MhpR as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Because the N-terminal sequence of MhpR was shown to be MQNNEQT, the mhp intergenic region spans from nucleotide 850 (ATG of mhpR) to nucleotide 1043 (ATG of mhpA) within the reported sequence of the mhp cluster, and MhpR (277 amino acids) becomes 4 amino acids shorter than previously proposed (14Ferrández A. García J.L. Díaz E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To study the Pa and Pr promoters of the mhp cluster, a 0.5-kb DNA fragment containing the intergenic mhpR-mhpA region was PCR-isolated and ligated, at both orientations, to the lacZ reporter gene of the promoter-probe vector pSJ3 (Table I), generating the translational fusion plasmids, pAL (Pa-lacZ) and pRL (Pr-lacZ) (Fig. 2A). Moreover, to analyze the role of the mhpR regulatory gene on the Pa and Pr promoters, we have engineered plasmid pRAL (mhpR/Pa-lacZ), which harbors the mhpR gene under control of its own promoter in cis, to the Pa-lacZ reporter fusion in a pSJ3 derivative (Fig. 2A), and pPAL (Plac-mhpR), which encodes the mhpR gene under control of the heterologous Plac promoter (Fig. 2B). To avoid the high copy number of the pSJ3 derivatives"

In this study we demonstrate elevated expression of sub-telomeric and Ty retrotransposon-proximal genes in two mcm5 strains. This pattern of up-regulated genes resembles the genome-wide association of MCM proteins to chromatin that was reported earlier. We link the altered gene expression in mcm5 strains to a reversal of telomere position effect (TPE) and to remodeling of sub-telomeric and Ty chromatin. We also show a suppression of the Ts phenotype of a mcm5 strain by the high copy expression of the TRA1 component of the chromatin-remodeling SAGA/ADA (SPT-ADA-GCN5 acetylase/ADAptor). We propose that MCM proteins mediate the establishment of silent chromatin domains around telomeres and Ty retrotransposons.

(mini-chromosome maintenance) genes had been identified in screens for Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants, which displayed high rates of minichromosome loss (1Tye B.K. Methods. 1999; 18: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). MCM2-MCM7 homologues were subsequently found in all eukaryotes. It is believed that MCM proteins act as a component of the licensing machinery, which limits the occurrence of DNA replication to once per cell cycle (2Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Labib K. Diffley J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). MCM proteins form pre-replicative complexes at active as well as silent origins in S. cerevisiae or on un-replicated DNA in higher eukaryotes in a manner dependent on origin recognition complex (ORC) and Cdc6 (2Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Labib K. Diffley J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Activation of these pre-replicative complexes by protein kinases is required for initiation of replication (2Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Labib K. Diffley J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Removal of the MCM complex from origins at the time of initiation is believed to limit origin firing until the next cell cycle when the pre-replicative complex is re-established (2Lei M. Tye B.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Labib K. Diffley J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). MCM proteins also seem to have a post-initiation role in DNA replication as indicated by their association with moving replication forks (4Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) and by the requirement for their uninterrupted function for fork progression in S. cerevisiae (5Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In vitro assembled MCM complexes have also been shown to have DNA helicase activity consistent with a role in both melting of origin DNA and unwinding during fork elongation (3Labib K. Diffley J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Some of the properties of MCM proteins suggest that they may have functions that extend beyond the regulation of DNA replication. They are 100- to 1000-fold more abundant than the estimated number of origins in S. cerevisiae (6Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5081-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 7Young M.R. Tye B.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1587-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and mammals (8Burkhart R.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Mammalian MCMs have been reported to associate with large complexes containing or contacting RNA polymerase II and general pol II transcription factors (10Yankulov K. Todorov I. Romanowski P.

Other studies have linked MCM proteins to chromatin remodeling based on the interaction between the MCM proteins and histone H3/H4 dimers (17Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15397-15408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Genome-wide analyses of initiation of DNA replication in S. cerevisiae (20Raghuraman M.K. Winzeler E.A. Collingwood D. Hunt S. Wodicka L. Conway A. Lockhart D.J. Davis R.W. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Science. 2001; 294: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 21Newlon C.S. Theis J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) mapped 332 origins of replication. However, genome-wide mapping of the association of ORC and MCM proteins to chromatin (22Wyrick J.J. Aparicio J.G. Chen T. Barnett J.D. Jennings E.G. Young R.A. Bell S.P. Aparicio O.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) indicated at least 429 binding sites for these complexes. Only 79% of the ORC·MCM binding sites on chromosome X serve as origins. Another notable feature of ORC·MCM distribution is the clustering of ORC·MCM at telomeres, near Ty-transposable elements as well as solo Ty-LTR elements. Although telomeric X and Y′ elements are known to contain inactive or late replicating ARS elements where pre-replicative complexes could assemble (23Chan C.S. Tye B.K. Cell. 1983; 33: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), Ty and solo Ty-LTR elements are not known to associate with replication origins. It was suggested that this association of ORC·MCM with extensive repetitive elements could influence chromatin organization and genome stability (22Wyrick J.J. Aparicio J.G. Chen T. Barnett J.D. Jennings E.G. Young R.A. Bell S.P. Aparicio O.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Gene expression in the proximity of telomeres is reversibly repressed to produce either actively transcribed or completely silent chromatin, a phenomenon referred to as TPE (telomere position effect) (24Tham W.H. Zakian V.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 512-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the major regulators of TPE, the SIR genes and RAP1, also have an effect on the silent mating type loci (HM) and on rRNA gene repression (25Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 26Roy N. Runge K.W. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 111-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HDF1 and HDF2 are required for silencing at telomeres, but not at the HM loci (27Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 28Laroche T. Martin S.G. Gotta M. Gorham H.C. Pryde F.E. Louis E.J. Gasser S.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 653-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, silencing of different regions appears to involve non-identical regulatory mechanisms that have some common features. It is notable that many of the genes that affect silencing at telomeres and the HM loci are also involved in some aspects of DNA replication (29Ehrenhofer-Murray A.E. Kamakaka R.T. Rine J. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1171-1182PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dillin A. Rine J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ehrenhofer-Murray A.E. Gossen M. Pak D.T. Botchan M.R. Rine J. Science. 1995; 270: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, a number of studies suggest that DNA replication itself is not required for silencing (29Ehrenhofer-Murray A.E. Kamakaka R.T. Rine J. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1171-1182PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dillin A. Rine J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. Science. 2001; 291: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For example, analysis of the two components of ORC, ORC2 and ORC5, showed that their roles in silencing and replication are separable (30Dillin A. Rine J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ehrenhofer-Murray A.E. Gossen M. Pak D.T. Botchan M.R. Rine J. Science. 1995; 270: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Another transcriptional repression phenomenon was recently described for Ty1-transposable elements (33Jiang Y.W. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Morillon A. Benard L. Springer M. Lesage P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2078-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Ty elements are dormant under normal conditions but under stress can be induced to produce as much as 10% of the total RNA (33Jiang Y.W.

Re-establishment of the silent state in all genome Ty1 elements is mediated by a co-suppression mechanism, which requires expression of Ty1 from a high copy plasmid and is counteracted by the SWI/SNF chromatin-modifying complex and the histone acetyltransferase SAGA (33Jiang Y.W. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Morillon A. Benard L. Springer M. Lesage P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2078-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As in TPE, Ty suppression is epigenetic such that in a single cell all or none of the Ty elements are expressed (33Jiang Y.W. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Morillon A. Benard L. Springer M. Lesage P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2078-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this report we analyzed global gene expression in four mcm5 mutants. We found that a considerable number of genes in the vicinity of telomeres and Ty elements were up-regulated at the restrictive temperature in two of the mutants. This up-regulation correlated with chromatin remodeling of the affected genome regions and reversal of TPE. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Complemented meroploid mcm5-1::MCM5, mcm5-2::MCM5, mcm5-3::MCM5, and mcm5-461::MCM5 were produced by transforming the corresponding mutant mcm5 strains with YIp122CDC46 (38Gauthier L. Dziak R. Kramer D.J. Leishman D. Song X. Ho J. Radovic M. Bentley D. Yankulov K. Genetics. 2002; 162: 1117-1129PubMed Google Scholar) linearized by BspHI to produce tandem MCM5 duplications. Positive clones were selected on SC/-Leu plates and then on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) plates at 37 °C. Telomere reporter strains, mcm5-461-VIIL-URA3-tel, mcm5-461-VR-URA3-tel, mcm5-461::MCM5-VIIL-URA3-tel, and mcm5-461::MCM5-VR-URA3-tel were produced by transforming mcm5-461::MCM5 and mcm5-461 with YIpADH4UCAIV (39Gottschling D.E.

URA3 is inserted next to the partially truncated telomeric TG1–3 repeats of the left arm of chromosome VII (VIIL-URA3-tel) and the right arm of chromosome V (VR-URA3-tel), respectively (39Gottschling D.E.

Positive clones were streaked on SC/-Ura, FOA, and SC/-Leu plates at 30 °C and on YPD medium at 37 °C to select for strains that exhibit true TPE and display the expected phenotypes. The pAS-TRA1 plasmid (2 μm, TRP1, TRA1) was described in a previous study (40Saleh A. Schieltz D. Ting N. McMahon S.B. Litchfield D.W. Yates 3rd, J.R. Lees-Miller S.P. Cole M.D. Brandl C.J. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression—Mutant mcm5 and complemented mcm5::MCM5 strains were grown in YPD at 30 °C or 37 °C to A 600 = 0.2–0.5 and harvested on crushed ice. Total RNA was isolated by the lithium chloride method and cDNA was synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA by reverse transcribing with SuperScript II (Stratagene) in the presence of amino-allyl dUTP. N-Hydroxysuccinimide Cy5 and Cy3 dyes (Amersham Biosciences) were coupled to the amine-modified cDNA according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Microarrays containing all 6200 ORFs from the S. cerevisiae genome were from the Microarray Center at OCI, Toronto, Canada. Hybridization was for 18 h at 37 °C. The microarrays were scanned with Axon GenePix 4000a microarray scanner. Differentially expressed genes were identified as 2-fold up- or down-regulated and clustered for n number of experiments with GeneSpring version 5.0 software (Silicon Genetics). Statistical Evaluation of the Data—The evaluation was performed according to the textbook “Introductory Statistics” (41Hassett N. Weiss M. Introductory Statistics. 3rd. Ed. Addison-Wesley, 1991Google Scholar) and was based on the information provided in mips.gsf.de/proj/yeast and Refs. 22Wyrick J.J. Aparicio J.G. Chen T. Barnett J.D. Jennings E.G. Young R.A. Bell S.P.

Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blots were performed with 10 μg of total RNA isolated from cells grown at 30 °C or 37 °C to A 600 = 0.2–0.5. Probes were synthesized by PCR from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA with primer pairs, which amplified fragments as follows: a 500-bp fragment from COS1, a 400-bp fragment from YFL068, a 460-bp fragment from HXK1, a 430-bp fragment from ACT1, a 330-bp fragment from DAN3, a 570-bp fragment from NCE103, and a 400-bp fragment from the Ty1B protein. The HXK1, ACT1, DAN3, NCE103, and Ty1B fragments recognize unique sequences in the yeast genome as confirmed by BLAST search. The COS1 probe shares significant homology with the conserved sub-telomeric COS1–8 genes. The YFL068 probe shares homology with 10 other sub-telomeric ORF sequences. The amplified fragments were synthesized by a second round of PCR to minimize the amount of genomic DNA in the sample and then labeled by random primer. The Northern protocol, PCR conditions, and primer sequences are available upon request. Telomere Position Effect Assay—The TPE assay was performed as described earlier (39Gottschling D.E. Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, three independent isolates of mcm5-461-VIIL-URA3-tel, mcm5-461-VR-URA3-tel, mcm5-461::MCM5-VIIL-URA3-tel, and mcm5-461::MCM5-VR-URA3-tel were streaked on YPD, Sc/-Ura, and FOA plates to confirm variegated expression of URA3 and then grown for about 12 generations in YPD liquid cultures at 30 °C or 37 °C. Serial 1:10 dilutions of these cultures were spotted on YPD, SC/-Ura, and FOA plates and grown at 30 °C until colonies were visible. The colonies were counted and average percent of FOAR cells was estimated. Micrococcal Nuclease Sensitivity Assay—Mutant mcm5 and complemented mutant strains were grown in 150 ml of YPD to A 600 = 0.5–1 and spheroplasts were prepared by Zymolyase treatment for 10–15 min at 37 °C. Spheroplasts were re-suspended by vortexing for 15 s in 2 ml of lysis/MN solution (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 100 units/ml micrococcal nuclease (Worthington), 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) at 37 °C. 400-μl aliquots were removed at different time points and added to 100 μl of STOP solution (3 m NaCl, 3% SDS, 100 mm EDTA, 20 mm EGTA) pre-equilibrated at 60 °C. DNA was isolated, and 10 μg were analyzed by Southern blot with the same probes that were used for Northern analysis. Analysis of Differential Gene Expression in mcm5 Strains— An earlier analysis of gene expression of the mcm5-461 strain has indicated that several COS genes, which are positioned next to telomeres, were up-regulated at 37 °C compared with 30 °C (Ref. 38Gauthier L. Dziak R. Kramer D.J. Leishman D. Song X. Ho J. Radovic M. Bentley D. Yankulov K. Genetics. 2002; 162: 1117-1129PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). It was unclear if the observed effect was determined by the position of the COS genes or it is a normal response to elevated temperature. To systematically correlate MCM5 function to gene expression we selected four previously characterized mcm5 strains (43Maine G.T. Sinha P. Tye B.K. Genetics. 1984; 106: 365-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Hennessy K.M. Lee A. Chen E. Botstein D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 958-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and produced isogenic complemented strains (Table I) by inserting MCM5-LEU2 alleles in the corresponding mcm5 alleles. mcm5-2 and mcm5-461 displayed significant temperature sensitivity at 37 °C relative to their corresponding complemented strains (Fig. 1). mcm5-1 showed intermediate and mcm5-3 showed mild Ts phenotypes, respectively (Fig. 1). All complemented strains grew indistinguishably from unrelated wt strains at both 30 °C and 37 °C (data not shown). We used these strains to conduct micro-array analysis of global gene expression. Two independent experiments were performed with each mutant versus its complemented strain at both 30 °C and 37 °C. We defined differentially expressed genes as 2-fold up- or down-regulated. Using this criterion we looked for common ORFs in different experiments by the clustering algorithm of the GeneSpring version 5.0 software. These analyses identified no consistent differences between complemented and mutant strains at 30 °C (analysis not included). At the same time, the same criteria pointed to considerable similarities in the expression patterns of mcm5-1 and mcm5-461 versus their isogenic complemented counterparts at 37 °C (Table II). In these strains we found 85 genes that were up-regulated and five genes that were down-regulated in three out of the four experiments. Comparison of all mcm5 mutants at 37 °C did not reveal other clusters of common genes (analysis not included). There were no significant similarities between mcm5-2 and mcm5-3 (analysis not included). In summary, we observed a common pattern of differentially expressed genes in the mcm5-1 and the mcm5-461 strains at the restrictive temperature. It is important to note that mcm5-1 and mcm5-461 were identified in different screens using different parent strains (43Maine G.T. Sinha P. Tye B.K.

We also examined if the ORFs are immediately next to a pro-ARS (binds MCM·ORC proteins and has ARS activity (22Wyrick J.J. Aparicio J.G. Chen T. Barnett J.D. Jennings E.G. Young R.A. Bell S.P. Aparicio O.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar)) or a false ARS (binds MCM·ORC proteins but has no ARS activity (22Wyrick J.J. Aparicio J.G. Chen T. Barnett J.D. Jennings E.G. Young R.A. Bell S.P. Aparicio O.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar)) sites (Table II, column II). Because some mcm mutants arrest in early S or before M phase of the cell cycle, we examined if the listed ORFs were previously reported as cell cycle-regulated genes (42Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3899) Google Scholar) (Table II, column III). We noticed a high representation of ORFs within 5 kb of Y′ or X telomere elements, within 3 kb of Ty and within 2 kb of solo Ty-LTR elements or tRNA genes as well as genes whose expression is at its peak in M/G1 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. It is worthwhile mentioning that a group of eight genes within 5 kb of telomeres, five genes within 3 kb of Ty elements, and nine other genes were up-regulated in two of the four experiments but did not show a value in the other two as determined by the GeneSpring software. These genes were excluded from future analyses. To evaluate the significance of this higher representation of genes we estimated the total number of ORFs in the analyzed genome areas (Table III, column I) and calculated their expected random frequency (E) (Table III, column III). We also calculated the expected random frequency (E) of genes next to pro-ARS and false ARS elements (22Wyrick J.J. Aparicio J.G. Chen T. Barnett J.D. Jennings E.G. Young R.A. Bell S.P. Aparicio O.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and cell cycle-regulated genes (42Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3899) Google Scholar) (Table III, column III). The observed frequency (O)of all these ORFs was calculated in Table III (column IV). Finally, we calculated the difference between expected and observed frequency as (O – E)2/E (Table III, column V). A value close to 0 indicates random distribution. We observed significantly higher than expected frequency for ORFs within 5 kb of telomeres and within 3 kb of Ty elements, respectively (Table III, column V). The representatives of these two main groups of ORFs constitute 41% of the up-regulated genes in the two mcm5 strains and 4% of the total ORFs in the genome. ORFs within 1.5 kb of tRNA genes, solo Ty-LTR elements and 3 kb of rRNA genes showed moderate increase of the observed relative to the expected frequency, whereas ORFs within 5–20 kb from telomeres, 5 kb from centromeres or immediately next to pro-ARS or false ARS elements appeared at the random frequency (Table III, column V).

https://openalex.org/W2071975677,"POZ-domain transcription factors are characterized by the presence of a protein-protein interaction domain called the POZ or BTB domain at their N terminus and zinc fingers at their C terminus. Despite the large number of POZ-domain transcription factors that have been identified to date and the significant insights that have been gained into their cellular functions, relatively little is known about their DNA binding properties. FBI-1 is a BTB/POZ-domain protein that has been shown to modulate HIV-1 Tat trans-activation and to repress transcription of some cellular genes. We have used various viral and cellular FBI-1 binding sites to characterize the interaction of a POZ-domain protein with DNA in detail. We find that FBI-1 binds to inverted sequence repeats downstream of the HIV-1 transcription start site. Remarkably, it binds efficiently to probes carrying these repeats in various orientations and spacings with no particular rotational alignment, indicating that its interaction with DNA is highly flexible. Indeed, FBI-1 binding sites in the adenovirus 2 major late promoter, the c-fos gene, and the c-myc P1 and P2 promoters reveal variously spaced direct, inverted, and everted sequence repeats with the consensus sequence G(A/G)GGG(T/C)(C/T)(T/C)(C/T) for each repeat.

Five to ten percent of zinc finger proteins contain at their N terminus a conserved 120-amino acid motif called the BTB/POZ domain (for broad-complex, tramtrack, and bric-a-brac/pox virus and zinc finger), from hereon referred to as the POZ domain. This domain is also found in some actin-binding proteins, ion channels, and other proteins of various functions (1Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G. Leprince D.

In contrast, much less is known about their DNA binding properties, and DNA binding sites are known for only about 10% of the ∼140 POZ-domain zinc finger proteins listed in the SMART data base (5Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). The known POZ-domain protein DNA binding sites display considerable sequence heterogeneity. Two POZ-domain zinc finger proteins whose DNA binding properties have been characterized in some detail, i.e. the GAGA factor and Kaiso, bind DNA with surprising flexibility (6Espinas M.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2911-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The GAGA factor can bind variable numbers of sites with flexible spacing, and Kaiso recognizes distinct binding sites of different sequences. It is not known whether this flexibility is a frequent feature of POZ-domain proteins, but at least in these cases it is consistent with these proteins playing a role in the regulation of a variety of genes. We have previously described FBI-1 (factor binding to IST) (9Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning revealed FBI-1 to be a 61.5-kDa Krüppel-type zinc finger protein with a POZ domain at the N terminus and four C2-H2 zinc fingers at the C terminus (12Morrison D.J. Pendergrast P.S. Stavropoulos P. Colmenares S.U. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). FBI-1 can self-associate via both the POZ and zinc finger domains (12Morrison D.J. Pendergrast P.S. Stavropoulos P. Colmenares S.U. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, it associates via its POZ domain with activation competent, but not with activation-deficient, HIV-1 Tat protein (13Pendergrast P.S. Wang C. Hernandez N. Huang S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 915-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpressed FBI-1 stimulates Tat trans-activation in transient transfection assays and partially co-localizes with Tat and the cellular Tat co-factor P-TEFb in the splicing factor-rich nuclear speckles (13Pendergrast P.S. Wang C. Hernandez N. Huang S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 915-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistent with playing a role in cellular transcription regulation, a less soluble fraction of FBI-1 also localizes to an unusual subnuclear domain where it appears to associate with active chromatin (13Pendergrast P.S. Wang C. Hernandez N. Huang S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 915-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Indeed, FBI-1 has been shown to repress transcription of some extracellular matrix genes (14Widom R.L. Lee J.Y. Joseph C. Gordon-Froome I. Korn J.H. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (these authors refer to FBI-1 as hcKrox-β) and of the ADH5/FDH promoter (15Lee D.K. Suh D. Edenberg H.J. Hur M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the proposed mechanism of repression is interference by FBI-1 with the binding of SP-1 to a GC-box adjacent to an FBI-1 binding site. Most recently, FBI-1 was identified as one of several genes overexpressed in precursor B-leukemia cells protected from apoptosis by integrin stimulation (16Astier A.L. Xu R. Svoboda M. Hinds E. Munoz O. de Beaumont R. Crean C.D. Gabig T. Freedman A.S. Blood. 2003; 101: 1118-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two mammalian homologues of FBI-1, whose DNA binding sites are unknown, have been isolated. The mouse homologue, leukemia/lymphoma-related factor, is a developmentally highly regulated nuclear protein that associates with the POZ-domain protein BCL-6 (17Davies J.M. Hawe N. Kabarowski J. Huang Q.H. Zhu J. Brand N.J. Leprince D. Dhordain P. Cook M. Morriss-Kay G. Zelent A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The rat homologue, osteoclast-derived zinc finger protein, has been shown to play a role in osteoclast differentiation (18Kukita A. Kukita T. Ouchida M. Maeda H. Yatsuki H. Kohashi O. Blood. 1999; 94: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that FBI-1 is a transcription factor involved in diverse aspects of development and differentiation. Considering the paucity of information on DNA binding of POZ-domain proteins, we have used the binding site of FBI-1 in the HIV-1 promoter, as well as other viral and cellular FBI-1 binding sites of unknown function, to characterize the DNA binding properties of a POZ-domain protein in detail. We find that high affinity FBI-1 binding sites consist of either a single guanine-rich site or two half-sites each with the consensus sequence G(A/G)GGG(T/C)(C/T)(T/C)(C/T), whose relative orientation and spacing vary greatly. Taken together, our results demonstrate that FBI-1 binds DNA with remarkable flexibility. Consistent with it playing a role in diverse biological processes, FBI-1 thus has the potential to act at a variety of cellular sequences. Plasmids—Relevant sequences of all constructs are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 5A. The constructs DD, DDΔ30, UD and UDΔ25 were generated as follows. Oligonucleotides with complementary sequences of ∼30 nucleotides at their 3′ ends were annealed and the 3′ recesses were then filled in with the large fragment of DNA polymerase 1 (Klenow fragment). The resulting double-stranded DNA fragments carried the desired sequence changes, as well as BamHI restriction sites at both ends. After digestion with BamHI, the fragments were ligated into pUC119 cleaved with BamHI. These constructs carry the following sequence changes. In DD and DDΔ30, the HIV-1 sequence segment from +49 to +84 is everted. In addition, in DDΔ30 the segment from +15 to +44 is deleted. In UD and UDΔ25, the segments comprising –22 to +12 and +49 to +84 are everted. In addition, in UDΔ25 the sequence from +19 to +43 is deleted.Fig. 5A, methylation interference analysis of FBI-1 binding to the HIV-1 promoter. The probe contained HIV-1 sequences from –45 to +82 and was labeled at its 5′ end either on the upper strand or lower strand, as indicated. Lanes 1 and 3 show the free probe (F) whereas lanes2 and 4 show the probe bound to FBI-1. The location of the start site of transcription (+1) and of the TATA box is indicated.

These constructs allowed for the amplification of probe fragments containing the respective HIV-1 sequences with universal primers hybridizing on either side of the pUC119 polylinker. 5Δ2/R was constructed by oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (19Zoller M.J. Smith M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 468-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The deletion mutants D1 through D8 were constructed by ligating double-stranded oligonucleotides carrying the appropriate deletions into the vector pHIV-1/R cleaved with XhoI and AflII. The latter, as well as plasmids pIST and pIST/Bu-, are described in Ref. 11Sheldon M. Ratnasabapathy R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed with end-labeled DNA probes generated by PCR amplification as described previously (9Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The use of a common radiolabeled PCR primer assured equal specific activity of all probes. The sources of FBI-1 were either heparin-Sepharose or hydroxy apatite column fractions from HeLa cell nuclear extract (9Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4C, 2 μl of heparin-Sepharose column fraction (20-fold purified in FBI-1 binding activity as compared with the nuclear extract, containing 3.5 μg/μl total protein and 5 ng/μl FBI-1 protein (9Pessler F.

Ph.D. dissertation, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY1994Google Scholar)) were used per binding reaction. In all other experiments, 0.5 to 1 μl of hydroxy apatite column fraction (54-fold purified in FBI-1 binding activity, containing 3.9 μg/μl total protein and 15 ng/μl FBI-1 protein (9Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Pessler F. Protein Complexex on the HIV-1 Promoter. Ph.D. dissertation, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY1994Google Scholar)) was used per binding reaction. FBI-1 contained in nuclear extract or the column fractions of different degrees of purification binds to DNA in the same sequence-specific manner (9Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Methylation Interference Assays—Methylation interference assays with dimethyl sulfate were carried out essentially as described (21Sturm R. Baumruker T. Franza Jr., B.R. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1147-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). DNA-protein binding reactions were identical to those employed for EMSAs (see above), except that they contained 300,000 cpm of end-labeled probe and 2–3 μl of hydroxy apatite column fraction containing partially purified FBI-1 (9Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 50 μl. After electrophoretic separation of bound from unbound DNA, 100,000 cpm were typically detected in the band corresponding to the FBI-1·DNA complex. FBI-1 recognizes an unusually large bipartite binding site in the HIV-1 promoter, which is depicted in Fig. 1A. It spans ∼100 base pairs between positions –23 and +78 with respect to the transcription start site and includes the IST promoter element (9Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This binding site is composed of two separate half-sites: the 5′ half-site, which is the most important for binding, consists of specific sequences from position +1 to +8, as well as nonspecific sequences from position –22 to –1. The 3′ half-site, which is less important but nevertheless contributes to efficient binding, consists of sequences from position +49 to +78, with the sequences from +56 to +66 contributing most to the affinity of this half-site. The 5′ and 3′ half-sites are largely contained within the previously described IST 5′ and 3′ functional half-elements (11Sheldon M. Ratnasabapathy R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We characterized the interaction of FBI-1 with the HIV-1 promoter in detail by testing a number of mutations, which are depicted in Fig. 1B. We also used the methylation interference assay to identify guanine residues in close proximity to FBI-1 in the HIV-1 promoter, several cellular promoters, and the Ad2 major late promoter. Each HIV-1 Half-site Is Capable of Binding FBI-1—To define further the role of each HIV-1 half-site in FBI-1 binding, we generated probes containing HIV-1 sequences from –18 to +24 and thus including the specific sequences constituting the 5′ half-site or HIV-1 sequences from +21 to +82 (and thus including the 3′ half-site) and tested them in an EMSA with partially purified FBI-1 [hydroxy apatite column fraction (see Ref. 9Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); this partially purified FBI-1 forms the same complex in an EMSA as recombinant FBI-1 expressed in Escherichia coli (see Ref. 12Morrison D.J. Pendergrast P.S. Stavropoulos P. Colmenares S.U. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 2D. J. Morrison and N. Hernandez, unpublished data. The results are shown in Fig. 2A. As expected, the FBI-1·DNA complex formed efficiently on the wild-type probe (Fig. 2A, lane 1, arrow). Signals of decreasing intensities were observed with probes containing the 5′ (lane 2) and 3′ (lane 3) half-sites, respectively, whereas only a background signal was obtained with a probe containing just the polylinker (lane 4). The signals observed were of the sizes expected for FBI-1·DNA complexes considering the different lengths of the probes. In Fig. 2B, the same probes were used as unlabeled competitors against the labeled wild-type probe. Consistent with the results in Fig. 2A, the complete FBI-1 binding site was an efficient competitor, the 3′ half-site was poor, and the 5′ half-site was intermediate (compare lanes 2–4 with lane 1). However, even the 3′ half-site was a better competitor than the full FBI-1 binding site debilitated by point mutations (msABC, lane 5; see Fig. 1B for the sequence of this mutant) or a DNA fragment carrying just the polylinker (lane 6). We then used each half-site as unlabeled competitor against the other half-site and against itself. As expected, each unlabeled half-site competed efficiently against itself (Fig. 2C, lanes 2–5 and 17–20). In addition, each half-site competed against the other half-site for formation of the complex, and the 5′ half-site competed more efficiently than the 3′ half-site against both a labeled 5′ half-site (compare lanes 2–5 with lanes 7–10) and a labeled 3′ half-site (compare lanes 12–15 with lanes 17–20). This was similar to the pattern observed above with the labeled wild-type probe, where the 5′ half-site was also a better competitor than the 3′ half-site (Fig. 2B). The binding of FBI-1 to an isolated 3′ half-site was unexpected, because we observed previously (9Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that FBI-1 did not bind detectably to a mutant probe (msABC(5′)) carrying an intact 3′ FBI-1 half-site and a mutated 5′ half-site. This discrepancy probably results from the higher concentration of nonspecific competitor nucleic acids used in our previous experiments. In addition, it is possible that the mutated 5′ half-site, which is not present in the probes used here (Fig. 2), in some way interfered with FBI-1 binding to the 3′ half-site. At any rate, the present findings indicate that complexes with similar binding specificities form on each half-site and on the complete FBI-1 binding site. Together with our previous observation that on probes containing the entire FBI-1 binding site, point mutations in either FBI-1 half-site weaken the FBI-1·DNA complex but do not change its mobility (9Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the results suggest that each individual half-site can bind FBI-1 but with lower affinity than the complete wild-type binding site. The Half-sites Contain an Imperfect Palindrome—As indicated by the arrows in Fig. 1A, the sequences most important for FBI-1 binding in each half-site constitute a pair of imperfect inverted repeats, which corresponds to the sequences encoding the base of the TAR stem-and-loop structure. This suggests that each half-site may be recognized similarly by FBI-1. If this is the case, making the 5′ half-site more similar to the weaker 3′ half-site should decrease binding of FBI-1, whereas making the 3′ half-site more similar to the stronger 5′ half-site should increase binding of FBI-1. To test this hypothesis, we introduced the mutations shown in Fig. 3B and tested the resulting probes in the EMSA shown in Fig. 3A. Deleting the C-G base pair at position +5 and thus making the 5′ repeat more similar to the 3′ repeat reduced FBI-1 binding (mutant 5′Δ2; compare lanes 3 and 2). Strikingly, however, inserting a G-C base pair after position +55 and thus making the 3′ repeat more similar to the 5′ repeat enhanced FBI-1 binding (mutant pISTBu–, compare lanes 5 and 4). Taken together, these results suggest that FBI-1 recognizes sequences in each half-sites with the same specificity and that the 3′ repeat is “imperfect” with respect to the 5′ repeat. FBI-1 Binds to DNA in a Flexible Manner—The segments of the FBI-1 half-sites most critical for binding are located in transcribed DNA that encodes the base of the TAR RNA stem-and-loop structure. It is therefore possible that the structure of TAR, e.g. the binding sites for Tat and its co-factors, imposes a suboptimal spacing of the FBI-1 half-sites. To test this hypothesis, we altered the spacing between the half-sites by insertions or deletions and determined the relative affinities of the resulting probes for FBI-1 by EMSA. Fig. 4A shows the 5′ and 3′ half-sites (shaded sequences) as determined previously by clustered point mutations, as well as the locations of the clustered point mutations (brackets above sequences) that delineated the internal borders of the 5′ and 3′ half-sites (constructs ms153 and ms2–3/fp in Ref. 9Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The spacing between the two half-sites in the various constructs, calculated between the guanine at position +1, near the 5′ end of the 5′ repeat, and the corresponding guanine on the lower strand at position +59, near the 5′ end (on the lower strand) of the 3′ inverted repeat, is indicated above the lanes in Fig. 4B, as well as the rotation angle between these same guanine residues. As shown in Fig. 4B, increasing the spacing between the half-sites by 44 bp reduced the binding efficiency by ∼50% (construct WT[ABC]WT; compare lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, progressive deletions between the half-sites initially either enhanced binding in a minor way (mutants pIST, D1, and D5; compare lane 3 with lanes 4, 5, and 9) or had no effect (mutants D3, D4, and D6; compare lane 3 with lanes 7, 8, and 10). Thus, D6, which lacked the sequences from +8 to +52, bound FBI-1 with wild-type efficiency. In contrast, the next deletion, D7, which lacked sequences from +6 to +55, abolished detectable binding (compare lanes 3, 10, and 11), either because it removed sequences required for binding, or because it gave rise to a suboptimal spacing between the half-sites. The D6 mutant thus localizes the maximal extent of the “inward” borders of the 5′ and 3′ half-sites more precisely: +7 for the 3′ border of the 5′ half-site, and +53 for the 5′ border of the 3′ half-site. As described below (see Fig. 5A and Fig. 6A), methylation of the Gly residue at position +7 interfered with binding of FBI-1, thus localizing the 3′ border of the 5′ half-site at +7. Moreover, our previous analysis of clustered point mutations mapped the 5′ border of the 3′ half-site between +49 and +56 (see bracket on top in Fig. 4A). Thus, we can now localize the 5′ border of the 3′ half-site between +53 and +56. These new maximal inward borders of the 5′ and 3′ half-sites are indicated below the sequences in Fig. 4A. As shown in Fig. 4B, the deletions rotated the half-sites with respect to each other to different extents (labeled in degrees above the lanes), but there was no correlation between the rotational displacement and formation of the FBI-1·DNA complex. Taken together, the above results indicate that (i) any distance between the half-sites from the natural spacing of 58 bp in HIV-1 to near juxtaposition is compatible with efficient binding of FBI-1, and (ii) there is no requirement for a particular rotational alignment of the half-sites on the DNA surface. We then tested whether the flexible binding of FBI-1 to DNA would extend to variations in the orientation of the half-sites with respect to each other. As outlined above, FBI-1 recognizes an imperfect inverted DNA sequence repeat downstream of the HIV-1 transcription start site. In mutant DD/pUC, sequences containing the 3′ half-site are flipped such that the 5′ and 3′ half-sites now form a direct repeat. In mutant UD/pUC, both half-sites are flipped, resulting in an everted repeat. In DDΔ30/pUC and UDΔ25/pUC, the spacing between the flipped half-sites is reduced by 30 and 25 bp, respectively, by deletion of non-binding sequences between the half-sites (see Fig. 1B, and see diagram above Fig. 4C). As shown in Fig. 4C, the FBI-1·DNA complex formed efficiently on all probes but was slightly enhanced on probes containing direct repeats and slightly reduced on probes containing everted repeats (probes UD, lane 4 and UDΔ25, lane 5) as compared with the wild-type HIV-1 sequences (lane 1). Quantification with a PhosphorImager of the shifted complexes in this and two replicate experiments revealed the following signals with respect to the wild-type probe: DD, 108–123%; DDΔ30, 115–122%; UD, 83–91%; UDΔ25, 73–80%. Thus, although small differences in FBI-1 binding efficiency were observed, no particular orientation of the half-sites was required, suggesting that FBI-1 can adopt a variety of conformations on the DNA. FBI-1 Contacts Guanine Residues in Each Half-site—To identify nucleotides in close contact with FBI-1, we used a methylation interference assay. Probes carrying HIV-1 sequences from –45 to +82 were modified with dimethyl sulfate, which methylates guanine residues at the N7 position in the major groove of the DNA, and were then used in an EMSA. Free DNA and DNA complexed with FBI-1 were then cleaved with piperidine and analyzed on a sequencing gel. The results are shown in Fig. 5. On the upper strand, methylation of three guanine residues at positions +1, +2, and +3 interfered significantly with formation of the FBI-1·DNA complex, with minor interference observed at position –10 (compare lanes 1 and 2; the wedges mark residues where interference was observed, and the size of the wedges correlates with the degree of interference). On the lower strand, methylation of two guanine residues at +5 and +7, as well as three guanine residues at +57, +58, and +59, interfered the most with FBI-1 binding, with less significant interference also observed at positions +61, +71, and +73 (compare lanes 3 and 4). Together with the deletion analysis described above (Fig. 4B), the observation that methylation of guanine +7 interferes strongly with binding suggests that the 3′ border of the 5′ half-site is at this position (see Fig. 4A). In summary, the methylation interference assay identified two clusters of guanine residues whose chemical modification within the major groove of the DNA interfered severely with FBI-1 binding: one located between +1 and +7, and one located between +57 and +59 (see bottom panel of Fig. 6A). These two clusters reside within the two regions in the HIV-1 promoter that were identified previously (9Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3786-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) by EMSA as contributing most to FBI-1 binding (see also Fig. 1A).

We used intraspecific polymorphisms of LPG structure to develop a genetic strategy leading to the identification of two genes (SCA1/2) mediating scAra capping. These LPG side chain β1,2-arabinosyltransferases (scβAraTs) exhibit canonical glycosyltransferase motifs, and their overexpression leads to elevated microsomal scβAraT activity. Although the level of scAra caps is maximal in metacyclic parasites, scβAraT activity is maximal in log phase cells. Because quantitative immunolocalization studies suggest this is not mediated by sequestration of SCA scβAraTs away from the Golgi apparatus during log phase, regulation of activated Ara precursors may control LPG arabinosylation in vivo. The SCA genes define a new family of eukaryotic βAraTs and represent novel developmentally regulated LPG-modifying activities identified in Leishmania.

Because quantitative immunolocalization studies suggest this is not mediated by sequestration of SCA scβAraTs away from the Golgi apparatus during log phase, regulation of activated Ara precursors may control LPG arabinosylation in vivo. The SCA genes define a new family of eukaryotic βAraTs and represent novel developmentally regulated LPG-modifying activities identified in Leishmania. The trypanosomatid protozoan parasite Leishmania causes a spectrum of diseases, ranging from mild cutaneous lesions to fatal visceral infections, that affect over 12 million people worldwide (1Ashford R.W. Desjeux P. deRaadt P. Parasitol. Today. 1992; 8: 104-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Leishmania is transmitted to a new vertebrate host by an insect vector, phlebotomine sand flies. When a sand fly bites an infected host, Leishmania amastigotes residing within the acidified phagosomes of macrophages are taken up and the blood meal enclosed by a midgut peritrophic matrix for several days, during which time parasites differentiate into the replicating procyclic promastigote stage. Several studies have emphasized the importance of the abundant promastigote surface glycolipid lipophosphoglycan (LPG) 1The abbreviations used are: LPG, lipophosphoglycan; PG, phosphoglycan; LmFV1, L. major strain Friedlin V1; FACE, fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis; scGal, galactosyl side chain; scAra, arabinosyl side chain; ORF, open reading frame; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; Tn, transposon; TM, transmembrane; GFP, green fluorescent protein; nt, nucleotide(s). and other phosphoglycans (PGs) for parasite survival in the hydrolytic environment of the sand fly midgut (reviewed in Refs. 2Sacks D.

Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 190: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Once the matrix is degraded, Leishmania promastigotes bind to midgut epithelium through an LPG-dependent interaction, to avoid being excreted with the remnants of the digested blood meal (5Pimenta P.F. Turco S.J. McConville M.J. Lawyer P.G. Perkins P.V. Sacks D.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As the sand fly prepares to feed again, parasites differentiate into the infectious metacyclic stage that synthesize a developmentally regulated, structurally distinct LPG that is unable to bind the midgut (5Pimenta P.F.

Parasitol. 1989; 69: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The ability of Leishmania to alter their surface coat to ensure survival in both their insect vectors and vertebrate hosts is a common theme shared by many protozoan parasites (9Roditi I. Liniger M. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The backbone structure of LPG is highly conserved among all Leishmania, consisting of a 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-phosphatidylinositol lipid anchor and heptasaccharide core joined to a phosphoglycan (PG) polymer of 15–30 (Galβ1,4Manα1-PO4) repeat units, terminated by an oligosaccharide cap (see Fig. 1). However, a number of modifications to this basic “backbone” structure have been found in different Leishmania strains and species, including a variety of oligosaccharide modifications of the PG repeats, the number of PG repeats, and the composition of the terminal oligosaccharide cap. Moreover, these modifications vary in different developmental stages, in a way that contributes to the stage-specific binding and release of the parasite during its infectious cycle in the fly (reviewed in Refs. 2Sacks D. Kamhawi S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 453-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 3Sacks D.L. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 4Ilg T. Med.

J. 1995; 310: 807-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For example, the ability of Leishmania major Friedlin V1 strain (LmFV1) parasites to establish and maintain infection in its natural vector Phlebotomus papatasi is facilitated by terminal β1,3-Gal side chains (scβGal) on LPG PG repeats, which bind midgut lectins (see Fig. 1B), and species or L. major mutants that lack LPG scβGal do not bind to and cannot be transmitted by P. papatasi (11Pimenta P.F. Saraiva E.M. Rowton E. Modi G.B. Garraway L.A. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Sacks D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1995; 181: 685-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). During metacyclogenesis of LmFV1, the LPG PG repeat number increases and scβGal residues are capped with β1,2-arabinose (βAra) to block midgut binding and favor parasite release (Fig. 1B) (6Sacks D.L. Brodin T.N. Turco S.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7McConville M.J. Turco S.J. Ferguson M.A. Sacks D.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3593-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In contrast, adhesion of Leishmania donovani in its natural vector Phlebotomus argentipes is mediated by a galactosylated terminal cap in procyclic promastigote LPG, whereas in metacyclic parasites conformational changes arising from increasing LPG length mask the LPG cap and allow parasites to be released (13Sacks D.L. Pimenta P.F. McConville M.J. Schneider P. Turco S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 685-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These data suggest that LPG acts as both a stage- and species-specific adhesin in the sand fly and that each parasite species has adapted its repertoire of LPG modifications for its particular sand fly vector species (2Sacks D. Kamhawi S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 453-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 3Sacks D.L. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). LPG modifications that accompany LmFV1 metacyclogenesis in vivo are replicated in procyclic promastigotes cultures in vitro, during the transition from logarithmic to stationary growth phase (6Sacks D.L.

This provides an experimentally convenient setting in which to pursue the identification of genes associated with this key developmental step. In this study we focused on the functional identification of genes participating in the stage-specific attachment of βAra to LPG scβGal, because of their importance in parasite transmission in the well-characterized L. major-P. papatasi model (see Fig. 1). Previously we identified genes affecting synthesis of the conserved LPG backbone using transfection-based functional rescue of LPG-deficient mutants (16Ryan K.A. Garraway L.A. Descoteaux A.

More recently, we have used cross-species transfection approaches to identify a constitutively expressed L. major gene family (SCG) that mediates LPG scβGal addition (20Dobson D.E. Scholtes L.D. Valdez K.E. Sullivan D.R. Mengeling B.J. Cilmi S. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15523-15531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we used “cross-strain” transfection to identify loci that mediate Ara capping of LPG scβGal during metacyclogenesis. The SCA (side chain Ara) genes encoding eukaryotic βAraTs represent important developmental genes mediating LPG structural changes necessary for parasite transmission from the sand fly to the mammalian host. Leishmania Culture and Transfection—L. major strain Friedlin V1 (LmFV1) is a virulent clonal derivative of the Friedlin line (MHOM/IL/80/Friedlin) obtained from D. L. Sacks (National Institutes of Health). L. major strain LV39 clone 5 (LmLV39) is a virulent clonal derivative of the LV39 strain (MRHO/SU/59/P) obtained from R. Titus (Colorado State University). Cells were grown in M199 medium at 26 °C containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (21Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Metacyclic promastigotes were isolated by the peanut agglutinin method (22Sacks D.L. Hieny S. Sher A. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 564-569PubMed Google Scholar) from cultures that had been in stationary growth phase for 2–3 days. Infections of BALB/c mice and recovery and purification of lesion amastigotes were performed as described previously (23Titus R.G. Gueiros-Filho F.J. de Freitas L.A. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10267-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Parasites were transfected by electroporation, and clonal lines were obtained by plating on semisolid M199 media (21Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), containing drugs appropriate for each selective marker (50 μg/ml hygromycin B and 15 μg/ml G418). Agglutination assays were performed using 3F12 monoclonal antibodies, which recognize the LPG [Ara(β1,2)Gal(β1,3)1,2-PG repeat unit] epitope (24Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M.

Cosmid Library Transfection and 3F12 Monoclonal Antibody Panning—These studies were approved by the relevant institutional biosafety committees. An LmFV1 genomic DNA library constructed in the cosmid shuttle vector cLHYG (strain B890 (24Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) was introduced by electroporation into LmLV39: 8600 independent transfectants were obtained, providing about 7-fold coverage of the Leishmania genome. Colonies were combined into three independent pools, and stationary phase transfectants bearing βAra-capped scβGal-modified LPG PG repeats were isolated by antibody panning using 3F12 antibody and plates coated with goat anti-mouse IgG (17Descoteaux A.

Three successive rounds of 3F12 antibody panning were performed, yielding a strongly reactive population. Parasites were plated to isolate individual colonies, and cosmid DNAs encoding the SCA1 locus (B2015, B2037, and B2016) or SCA2 locus (B2017 and B2039) were recovered by transformation of Escherichia coli (24Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Molecular Constructs—A 6.5-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment from SCA1 FV1 cosmid B2015 (Fig. 2) was inserted into BamHI+HindIII-digested pSNBR (27Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18427-18430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yielding pSNBR-SCA1 FV1 (B2350). The corresponding fragments from SCA2 FV1 cosmid B2017 was used to construct pSNBR-SCA2 FV1 (B3658). The 2.9-kb EcoNI-DraIII fragment from pSNBR-SCA FV1 containing the entire predicted SCA1 FV1 open reading frame (ORF) plus 423 bp of 3′ flanking DNA (Fig. 4) was inserted by blunt end cloning into the XmaI site of pXG (B1288; (28Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) to yield pXG-SCA1 FV1 (B3965). Relevant sequence of all constructs was verified using standard methods with an Applied Biosystems ABI-373 automated DNA sequencer.Fig. 4Identification and properties of SCA1 FV1. The active SCA1 FV1 gene was localized by transposon mutagenesis of pSNBR-SCA1 FV1 (Fig. 3); the relative location of TyK transposon (Tn) insertion sites within a portion of pSNBR-SCA1FV1 insert is indicated. Stationary phase-specific 3F12 reactivity of LmLV39 pSNBR-SCA1FV1 transfectants expressing each Tn insertion construct is shown by a “+.” The Tn120 insertion site was set at bp 1; the positions of EcoNI (En) and KpnI (K) restriction sites and the “SCA universal probe” are shown. The conserved 832-amino acid SCA ORF is represented as an open box. Locations of the predicted cytoplasmic domain (dark gray), transmembrane domain (black), presumptive glycosyltransferase DXDor(DXD)3 catalytic motifs, and N-glycosylation sites (asterisks) are noted.

A C-terminal SCA1 FV1 GFP fusion was made by PCR amplification of a SCA1 FV1 ORF lacking a stop codon using appropriate primers (B856 forward primer: 5′-ggaagatctccaccATGAGGGGGGACATCACAGCGT; B857 reverse primer: 5′-ggaagatctcagtggtggtggtggtggtggggcccGTATAAGCCCGTGTAAAACGA; Leishmania sequences are capitalized) and pXG-SCA1 FV1 template. This fragment was digested with BglII and ApaI, and blunt ends were generated by T4 DNA polymerase and ligated to BamHI linkers. After BamHI digestion, this fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of pXG-′GFP+ (B4394 (28Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar)) to generate pXG-SCA1 FV1 GFP (B3964). Microscopy—For fluorescence microscopy, live parasites were incubated with Hoechst 33342 to visualize nuclear and kinetoplast DNAs, fixed in 4% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, and photographed using an Olympus AX70 photomicrographic system. For immunoelectron microscopy, parasites were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm PIPES/0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2, for 1 h at 4 °C. Fixed parasites were embedded in 10% gelatin and infiltrated overnight with 2.3 m sucrose/20% polyvinyl pyrrolidone in PIPES/MgCl2 at 4 °C. Samples were trimmed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sectioned with a Leica Ultracut UCT cryo-ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems Inc.). 70-nm sections were blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum/5% normal goat serum (blocking buffer) for 30 min and subsequently incubated with rabbit anti-MBPGFP IgG (provided by E. Handman, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Australia) for 1 h. After washing with blocking buffer for 20 min, samples were probed with 18-nm colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody for 1 h. Parallel controls omitting the primary antibody were consistently negative under these conditions. Sections were washed in 100 mm PIPES buffer followed by a water rinse and stained with 0.3% uranyl acetate/2% polyvinyl alcohol. Samples were viewed with a 1200EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL). In Vitro Transposon Mutagenesis and DNA Sequencing—pSNBR-SCA1 FV1 was used as a target for TyK transposon (Tn) mutagenesis (29Garraway L.A. Tosi L.R.O. Wang Y. Moore J.B. Dobson D.E. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 27-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 120 transposon insertions were mapped, and 20 that fell within the Leishmania insert were transfected into LmLV39. Complete double-stranded DNA sequences were obtained for the 3.2-kb SCA1 FV1 region (GenBank™ AY230143) using Sequenase (USB) or Taquenase (Amersham Biosciences) and appropriate TyK-specific and SCA-specific oligonucleotide primers (29Garraway L.A. Tosi L.R.O. Wang Y. Moore J.B. Dobson D.E. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 27-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA Analyses—Total Leishmania RNAs were prepared using the Trizol method (Invitrogen), and 5-μg samples were analyzed by Northern blotting (30Cunningham M.L. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), using a radiolabeled EcoNI-KpnI fragment containing the SCA1 FV1 ORF (Fig. 4). cDNA was prepared using 1 μg of Leishmania total RNA and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction volume, following the manufacturer's directions. PCR reactions (20 μl), containing 1 μl of cDNA, 10 pmol each of L. major miniexon (B936, 5′-AACGCTATATAAGTATCAGTTCTGTACTTTA) and SCA-specific (B451, 5′-TGCGGCACACCATAGCAGTC or B453, 5′-CGAAGGTCCTTGCTGTGAG) primers, 0.25 mm dNTPs, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science) were performed in a PTC-200 thermocycler (MJ Research) using 60 °C annealing temperature and 1.5-min elongation time for a total of 35 cycles. Products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose, 1× TEA (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) gels. Purification and Analysis of LPG—For [3H]Ara metabolic labeling of LPG and βAraT assays, cells that had been in stationary growth phase for 1 day (2–4 × 107 cells/ml) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended at 2 × 109 cells/ml in fresh medium. Parasites were metabolically labeled with d-[3H]Ara (25 μCi/2 × 109 cells in 1 ml, 15 Ci/mmol) for 6 h in fresh medium at 26 °C. The pH was adjusted to neutral by dropwise addition of saturated sodium bicarbonate after 1–2 h. LPG was extracted and purified by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (31Orlandi Jr., P.A. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10384-10391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPG PG repeats were generated by hydrolysis under mild acid conditions (0.02 n HCl, 15 min at 60 °C), dephosphorylated with E. coli alkaline phosphatase (5 unit/ml, 16 h at 37 °C), and separated by descending paper chromatography with a solvent system consisting of n-butanol:pyridine:water (6:4:3, v/v) (12Butcher B.A. Turco S.J.

Chem. 1987; 262: 10384-10391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of dephosphorylated PG repeats were fluorophore labeled at the reducing ends with 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfate and analyzed by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) according to manufacturer's specifications (Glyko Inc., Novato, CA). When [3H]Ara-labeled PG repeats (50,000 cpm) were included, gels were visualized by UV illumination, and the radioactivity eluted from excised bands was measured by scintillation counting. In some studies PG repeats were treated with E. coli β-galactosidase (10 units/ml, 16 h at 37 °C (32Mahoney A.B. Sacks D.L. Saraiva E. Modi G. Turco S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9813-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)) before labeling for FACE analysis (12Butcher B.A. Turco S.J. Hilty B.A. Pimenta P.F. Panunzio M. Sacks D.L. J. Biol.

Strong acid hydrolysis followed by monosaccharide analysis of PG repeats indicated that the radiolabel remained as d-[3H]Ara (data not shown). LPG Glycosyltransferase Assays—Microsomes were prepared as described (12Butcher B.A. Turco S.J. Hilty B.A. Pimenta P.F. Panunzio M. Sacks D.L. J. Biol.

Sacks D.L. Saraiva E. Modi G. Turco S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9813-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), because it contains Gal side chains with minimal βAra capping (Fig. 1B). β1,3-Galactosyltransferase (scβGalT) assays were performed using microsomes (1 mg of protein), 6 μm UDP-[3H]Gal, and 10 μg of purified L. donovani LPG, which lacks Gal side chains (12Butcher B.A. Turco S.J.

Functional Identification of Genes Mediating LPG Side Chain Ara Capping—In L. major strain FV1 (LmFV1) procyclic promastigotes, LPG PG repeats typically contain one to two β1,3-Gal side chains (scβGal) that become further modified by β1,2-linked arabinose caps (scβAra) as parasites differentiate to the infectious metacyclic form in stationary growth phase (Fig. 1B). These metacyclic/stationary phase scβAra-capped PG repeats are reactive with the monoclonal antibody 3F12 (25Sacks D.L. da Silva R.P. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3099-3106PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kelleher M. Curtis J.M. Sacks D.L. Handman E. Bacic A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas procyclic/log phase promastigotes are 3F12-unreactive (Fig. 1B). In contrast to LmFV1, metacyclic/stationary phase parasites of L. major strain LV39c5 (LmLV39) remained unreactive with 3F12 (Fig. 1B). Although the structure of LmLV39 LPG was unknown initially, we reasoned that expression of the LmFV1 LPG side chain capping β1,2-Ara transferase (scβAraT) would confer 3F12 reactivity in metacyclic/stationary phase LmLV39 transfectants (Fig. 1B). An LmFV1 genomic library, prepared in the Leishmania shuttle cosmid vector cLHYG (24Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), was transfected into LmLV39, yielding 8600 independent transfectants. Transfectant pools were grown to stationary phase, and 3F12-reactive transfectants were recovered by 3F12 antibody panning; after three rounds, a strongly 3F12-reactive population emerged. Clonal lines were obtained by plating, and from 36 we recovered 5 different cosmids that conferred 3F12 reactivity upon retransfection into LmLV39 (Fig. 2). As for wild-type LmFV1, 3F12 reactivity was only observed when LmLV39 transfectants entered stationary phase. Restriction mapping showed these cosmids represented two loci that we named SCA (side chain Ara): SCA1 FV1 (cosmids B2015, B2016, and B2037) and SCA2 FV1 (cosmids B2017 and B2039). Further mapping and Southern blotting showed that these cosmid loci overlapped (Fig. 2 and data not shown), a conclusion that was recently confirmed by DNA sequencing of this chromosomal region (GenBank™ accession numbers AC087161 and AC084317). 2P. J. Myler, E. Sisk, J. Ruiz, P. Cosenza, A. Cruz, K. Stuart, D. E. Dobson, and S. M. Beverley, manuscript in preparation. Within each locus a large (13.7 kb) region showed similar restriction maps, which we termed the SCA conserved region (Fig. 2, gray box), and these were separated by 5.9 kb (Fig. 2). 2P. J. Myler, E. Sisk, J. Ruiz, P. Cosenza, A. Cruz, K. Stuart, D. E. Dobson, and S. M. Beverley, manuscript in preparation. Identification of SCA FV1 Genes—The active gene within SCA1FV1 cosmid B2015 was localized by 3F12 reactivity tests of LmLV39 transfectants bearing either deletion derivatives or following transposon (Tn) insertion mutagenesis (Fig. 3 and 4 and data not shown). Analysis of five SCA1 FV1/B2015 deletions identified a 6.5-kb region that conferred 3F12 reactivity (Fig. 3), again only in stationary phase transfectants. LmLV39 transfectants bearing this 6.5-kb SCA1 FV1 fragment inserted in the Leishmania shuttle vector pSNBR (27Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18427-18430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) similarly showed stationary phase-specific 3F12 reactivity (pSNBR-SCA1, Fig. 3), as did an analogous pSNBR construct containing the 6.5-kb SCA2 FV1 fragment (pSNBR-SCA2, Fig. 3). Analysis of twenty Tn insertions within the pSNBR-SCA1 FV1 insert showed four had lost 3F12 reactivity (Tns 38, 5, 105, and 9; Fig. 4 and data not shown). These Tn insertions clustered in a 2-kb region, and we obtained the DNA sequence out to the nearest flanking sites retaining 3F12 reactivity (Tns 120 and 30; Fig. 4; GenBank™ AY230143). This revealed a 2.5-kb open reading frame (ORF) encoding an 832-amino acid protein (Figs. 4 and 5). Expression of the predicted SCA1 FV1 ORF alone in the constitutive Leishmania expression vector pXG (pXG-SCA1 FV1) yielded 3F12-reactive LmLV39 transfectants, again showing stationary phase specificity (Fig. 3). Properties of the Predicted SCA1 FV1 Protein—The predicted SCA1FV1 protein contains 832 amino acids with the topology of a type II membrane protein (35Singer S.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 247-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), containing a single transmembrane domain (amino acids 50–72; TM in Fig. 4) preceded by an N-terminal signal anchor sequence of 49 amino acids (36Al-Qahtani A.

We have isolated a RING finger motif-containing protein, AO7, previously identified as an interacting protein with a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Ubc5B. We confirmed the protein-protein interaction between p65 and AO7 in vitro and in vivo and found that the C-terminal region of AO7 is responsible for the interaction with p65 TAD. AO7 was predominantly localized in the nucleus and activated the NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression upon stimulation with IL-1beta or TNF or overexpression of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase. We found that both the RING finger and the C-terminal regions of AO7 were necessary for the transcriptional activation. When cotransfected with plasmids expressing Gal4-p65 fusion proteins containing various functional domains of p65, we found that p65 TAD was essential for the transcriptional activation mediated by AO7. Furthermore, the p65-mediated transactivation was suppressed by a ubiquitination-defective AO7 mutant in which the essential Cys residue within the RING finger motif was substituted by Ser. These data suggest that AO7 interacts with the p65 TAD and modulates its transcriptional activity."

However, the distinguishing features of FA, progressive pancytopenia and predisposition toward cancer, are the primary reasons for premature death in affected individuals (4Auerbach A.D. Allen R.G.

Science. 2002; 297: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). However, analysis of the putative functions of these FA gene products has indicated that they interact in a common pathway (27Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J.

Genet. 2001; 10: 2253-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), although the function of this pathway is not clear. Investigation of DNA end joining activity both in intact patient-derived FA cells and in extracts prepared from these cells revealed a defect in DNA end joining activity (29Escarceller M. Rousset S. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Escarceller M. Buchwald M. Singleton B.K. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Moustacchi E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46243-46247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As this type of double-strand break repair is thought to occur in cells via a non-recombinational mechanism, these data indicate that FA cells have a deficiency in non-recombinational DNA repair. However, there is a growing body of evidence that also links FA proteins to recombinational DNA repair. First, the FANCB and FANCD1 genes were recently shown to be identical to BRCA2 (26Howlett N.G. Taniguchi T. Olson S. Cox B. Waisfisz Q. de Die-Smulders C. Persky N. Grompe M. Joenje H. Pals G. Ikeda H. Fox E.A. D'Andrea A.D. Science. 2002; 297: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Although its precise function is not known, cells lacking functional BRCA2 protein are nearly completely unable to repair restriction enzyme-generated chromosomal double-strand breaks via homologous recombination (HR) (33Moynahan M.E. Pierce A.J. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Second, the FANCD2 protein co-localizes with BRCA1 and RAD51 proteins to discrete nuclear foci following exposure to ionizing radiation (27Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 249-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 34Digweed M. Rothe S. Demuth I. Scholz R. Schindler D.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5002-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). BRCA1-deficient cells are also unable to properly utilize HR to rejoin chromosomal double-strand breaks (36Moynahan M.E. Cui T.Y. Jasin M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4842-4850PubMed Google Scholar), and it is well established that the recombination protein RAD51 plays an essential catalytic role in recombinational DNA repair (37Gupta R.C. Bazemore L.R. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 38Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Since it is known that recombinational repair is an important mechanism in the repair of DNA crosslinks (39Thompson L.H. Schild D. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), these results support the view that FA cells have a deficiency in HR. However, one potential difficulty with this interpretation is that direct examination of HR activity in fibroblasts from two unrelated FA patients of unidentified complementation group status failed to detect a defect in this activity (40Thyagarajan B. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23328-23333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Instead, it was shown that the level of intraplasmid HR activity in these cells was elevated 10–20-fold above that seen in normal fibroblasts. Thus, the most consistent interpretation is that FA cells have a deficiency in the regulation of these pathways that repair DNA double-strand breaks. To confirm the initial finding that FA cells have altered HR activity, as well as to gain insight into the nature of the regulation of DNA double-strand break repair pathways in FA cells, we first examined extrachromosomal HR activity in intact patient-derived FA cells of several known complementation groups. We found a 10-fold elevation in HR activity in FA cells belonging to complementation groups A, C, and G, which was reversed by genetic complementation via retroviral transduction. Furthermore, extracts from these cells also had an ∼10-fold increase in the level of RAD51 protein. Inhibition of RAD51 by co-electroporation of anti-RAD51 antibody into these cells restored HR activity to wild-type levels. Interestingly, FA fibroblasts of complementation group D2 did not display a similar elevation in either HR or RAD51 protein. Antibody-mediated inhibition of FANCD2 in intact normal cells showed that only DNA end joining activity was affected, whereas similar treatment of normal cells with anti-FANCC antibody altered both HR and DNA end joining activities. These data support the conclusion that the FA proteins deficient in the cells studied herein are involved in the regulation of both recombinational and non-recombinational DNA repair. Cell Culture and Plasmid Constructs—Cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere at 37 °C. All cell strains were obtained from the Oregon Health Sciences University Fanconi Anemia Cell Repository unless otherwise noted. Cell strains PD.715.F, PD.751.F, PD.792.F, PD.793.F, CCD-1059Sk, CCD-1056Sk, and CCD-1108Sk (American Type Culture Collection Cell Repository) are human diploid fibroblasts derived from normal subjects. The immortalized cell line HT1080 (American Type Culture Collection Cell Repository) was derived from a spontaneous human fibrosarcoma. Cell strains PD.720.F, PD.551.F, PD.145.F, and PD.352.F (referred to as A, C, D2, and G, respectively) are human diploid FA fibroblasts from patients of complementation groups A, C, D2, and G, respectively. The diploid cell strain PD.20.F, derived from an unrelated FA patient of complementation group D2, was used to prepare the nuclear extract used for Western blot analysis of RAD51; all other examinations of “D2” cells were performed with the PD.145.F cell strain. Cell strains 720-FAA, 551-FAC, and 352-FAG (referred to as Acor, Ccor, and Gcor, respectively) are retrovirally corrected FA cells that are infected with retroviruses encoding FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG cDNAs, respectively. Murine MPF60T and MPF62T cells are embryonic fibroblasts derived from mice homozygous for FancCΔexon 9 and from homozygous wild-type mice, respectively (41Whitney M.A. Royle G. Low M.J. Kelly M.A. Axthelm M.K. Reifsteck C. Olson S. Braun R.E. Heinrich M.C. Rathbun R.K. Bagby G.C. Grompe M. Blood. 1996; 88: 49-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the patient-derived L554P mutant FANCC allele (referred to as pL554P) and the wild-type FANCC allele were kindly provided by Dr. Maureen E. Hoatlin (Oregon Health Sciences University and Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Portland, OR) (42Youssoufian H. Li Y. Martin M.E. Buchwald M. J. Soc. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Intracellular HR Assay in Intact Cells—Two similar but slightly different assays were utilized to measure HR in intact cells; both were described previously (40Thyagarajan B. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23328-23333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Intraplasmid HR—Briefly, intraplasmid extrachromosomal HR was assayed in human diploid fibroblasts by electroporating the plasmid substrate pSV2neoDR:DL(D) (40Thyagarajan B. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23328-23333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) along with plasmid pRSVEd1884 (43Ray F.A. Peabody D.S. Cooper J.L. Cram L.S. Kraemer P.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 42: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The latter plasmid encodes the SV40 large T-antigen, expression of which drives replication of plasmids containing an SV40 origin of replication. It is noteworthy that pRSVEd1884 lacks such an origin of replication. The former plasmid contains an intact β-lactamase gene (AMP) that confers resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin, as well as a tandem repeat of two defective heteroalleles of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (NEO). Each allele contains a different, non-overlapping deletion within the NEO gene (referred to as DR and DL), which renders it nonfunctional. HR occurring between these heteroalleles can regenerate an intact and functional NEO gene, which confers resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin. Following plasmid electroporation, mammalian cells were incubated for 48 h. Plasmid DNA was then recovered from the cells (44Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar) and incubated with the restriction enzyme DpnI, which digests plasmids that have not replicated in mammalian cells. Finally, plasmids were electroporated into DH10B electrocompetent reporter bacteria. HR frequency in the mammalian cells was determined by comparing the number of resulting bacterial colonies obtained from growth on ampicillin-containing medium (referred to as “non-recombinant colonies”) with the number obtained from growth on ampicillin- and kanamycin-containing medium (referred to as “recombinant colonies”). In some experiments, antibody (0.4 μg) was introduced into cells via co-electroporation with plasmid substrate. Interplasmid HR—To determine the frequency of interplasmid HR in murine cells, plasmids pPYSV2neoDL and pPYSV2neoDR were coelectroporated into cells. Following a 48-h incubation period, the plasmid DNA was recovered (44Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar) and used to transform DH10B electrocompetent bacteria as described above. Both plasmids harbor intact AMP genes and the mouse polyoma origin of replication, but each contains a different nonfunctional allele of the NEO gene (these alleles are in fact identical to those present in pSV2neoDR:DL(D)). Thus, as in the case above, the ratio of kanamycin-resistant to ampicillin-resistant bacterial colonies obtained provides a measure of the frequency of interplasmid HR. In some experiments, antibody (0.4 μg) was co-electroporated into murine cells along with plasmid substrates for the indicated experiments. Plasmid End Joining in Intact Cells—DNA end joining assays in intact cells were performed as described previously (32Donahue S.L. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46243-46247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid pSV2neo (which encodes the SV40 origin of replication) was linearized by treatment with the restriction enzyme EcoRI to produce cohesive DNA ends or SmaI to produce blunt ends, gel-purified, and quantitated. Five micrograms of plasmid pRSVEdl884 (which encodes the SV40 large T-antigen, but does not replicate itself) was co-electroporated into mammalian cells along with 1.25 μg of linearized pSV2neo, and cells were incubated for 48 h. Plasmid DNA was subsequently recovered from the cells (44Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar) and incubated with the restriction enzyme DpnI to digest plasmids that did not replicate in mammalian cells. This recovered plasmid DNA was then introduced into DH10B electrocompetent reporter bacteria and plated onto LB agar-containing Petri dishes. Percent end joining was determined by dividing the number of bacterial colonies obtained from mammalian cells electroporated with linearized pSV2neo by the number of bacterial colonies obtained from mammalian cells electroporated with circular pSV2neo in a parallel experiment. Preparation of Protein Extracts—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared as previously described (31Lundberg R. Mavinakere M. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and were used for Western blot analysis. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared by washing cells attached to culture dishes three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered Tris, followed by incubation in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (125 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 375 mm sodium chloride, 0.25% SDS, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min. Subsequently, the lysed cell solution was collected and centrifuged at 7000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bradford assay (45Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar); these whole cell protein lysates were used for Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Equal concentrations of protein extracts were electrophoretically resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After a 1-h incubation in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, the membranes were probed with primary antibodies diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h. Membranes were then washed three times with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with the appropriate second antibody for 1 h. This treatment was followed by three additional washes with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline. Incubations with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) were then performed to detect antigens recognized by primary antibodies. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were prepared at the same time as all Western blots shown herein using the same concentrations of protein extracts. Antibodies—Goat polyclonal anti-RAD51 antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-AP endonuclease-1 antibody (REF-1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were used 1:1000 and 1:2500 dilutions, respectively, for Western blot analysis. Human polyclonal anti-RAD51 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Charles M. Radding (Yale University) and was used at a 1:2000 dilution for Western blot analysis. Rabbit polyclonal anti-RAD51 antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-MRE11 antibody (Novus Biologicals Inc., Littleton, CO) were used at 1:2000 dilutions for Western blot analysis. Mouse monoclonal anti-MRE11 antibody (BD Biosciences) was used at a 1:500 dilution for Western blot analysis. Rabbit monoclonal anti-KU86 antibody (Serotec, Raleigh, NC) was used at a 1:500 dilution for Western blot analysis. The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antisera to human proteins FANCC and FANCD2 were kindly provided by Dr. Alan D. D'Andrea (Harvard Medical School) and were co-electroporated into intact cells. Rabbit polyclonal anti-RAD51B, anti-RAD51C, anti-RAD51D, anti-XRCC2, and anti-XRCC3 antibodies (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) were used at 1:500 dilutions for Western blot analysis. Alkaline phosphataseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma) were used at 1:5000 dilutions for Western blot analysis. FA Fibroblasts of Complementation Groups A, C, and G Have Elevated Extrachromosomal HR Activity—It was previously shown that cells derived from two unrelated FA patients of unknown complementation groups had HR levels that were significantly greater than those seen in fibroblasts derived from normal subjects (40Thyagarajan B. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23328-23333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To confirm and extend this observation, an intraplasmid HR assay (40Thyagarajan B. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23328-23333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was used to determine the HR activity present in intact fibroblasts from FA patients from multiple known complementation groups. As shown in Fig. 1, FA fibroblasts from patients belonging to complementation groups A, C, and G all had significantly increased extrachromosomal HR frequency. The HR frequency observed was between 90 and 100 × 10–5. In contrast, the diploid cell strain PD.792.F, derived from a normal subject, had an HR frequency of only 9 × 10–5 (Fig. 1). Similar examination of three other cell strains from normal subjects revealed HR frequencies of 9 × 10–5, 10 × 10–5, and 10 × 10–5, respectively. These values were essentially identical to the HR frequencies of 9.5 × 10–5 and 9.9 × 10–5 previously reported in two different strains of diploid fibroblasts from unrelated normal donors (40Thyagarajan B. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23328-23333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, FA fibroblasts of complementation groups A, C, and G had a 9–10-fold increase in HR frequency. Interestingly, examination of HR in fibroblasts of complementation group D2 revealed that they did not have elevated HR activity (Fig. 1). Instead, these cells displayed HR activity of ∼9 × 10–5, similar to that in all normal cells examined. The frequency with which the reporter bacteria catalyzed HR was determined to be <1 × 10–5, indicating that the HR frequency results obtained reflect recombination events occurring in the mammalian somatic cells. Because concerns over the influence of the SV40 large T-antigen in DNA repair processes have been raised (46Digweed M. Demuth I. Rothe S. Scholz R. Jordan A. Grotzinger C. Schindler D. Grompe M. Sperling K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4873-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a second set of HR experiments were performed in which plasmid pRSVEdl884 was not co-electroporated into cells along with the recombination plasmid substrate. In these experiments, in which the SV40 large T-antigen was absent, the recombination plasmid substrate did not replicate. Nevertheless, we observed that HR frequency in diploid FA fibroblasts of complementation groups A, C, and G was elevated 8-, 9-, and 8-fold, respectively, above that observed in diploid fibroblasts from normal donors (data not shown). Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer with the appropriate cDNAs has been shown to render FA cells resistant to bifunctional cross-linking agents (18Strathdee C.A. Gavish H. Shannon W.R. Buchwald M.

Furthermore, this treatment has been shown to eliminate the sensitivity of FA cells to the cytotoxic effects of restriction enzyme-induced chromosomal DNA double-strand breaks (32Donahue S.L. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46243-46247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined HR frequency in the retrovirally corrected counterparts of FA cells that displayed elevated HR activity in Fig. 1. As shown in Table I, retrovirally corrected FA fibroblasts had HR frequencies that were not statistically different from those seen in normal diploid fibroblast cells. These data therefore show that the elevation of HR activity in FA fibroblasts of complementation groups A, C, and G is reversible and is not likely to be the consequence of spontaneous immortalization or secondary mutations affecting HR.Table IExtrachromosomal homologous recombination in FA and retrovirally corrected FA cellsCellsHR frequencyaExpressed as the number of recombinant colonies/105 non-recombinant colonies; average of six independent experiments.Normal fibroblastsPD.792.F9FA fibroblastsPD.720.F (A)99bp < 0.05 compared with normal diploid fibroblasts.PD.551.F (C)94bp < 0.05 compared with normal diploid fibroblasts.PD.352.F (G)81bp < 0.05 compared with normal diploid fibroblasts.Retrovirally corrected FA720-FAA (Acor)15551-FAC (Ccor)12352-FAG (Gcor)14a Expressed as the number of recombinant colonies/105 non-recombinant colonies; average of six independent experiments.b p < 0.05 compared with normal diploid fibroblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2037910027,"We have used the Ras recruitment system to screen for proteins that interact with the N-terminally located transactivation domain of c-Myc. The Ras recruitment system is based on the activation of the mitogenic RAS signaling pathway in yeast by the mammalian GTPase Ha-Ras. This screen led to the identification of two novel nuclear proteins termed Krim-1A and Krim-1B that both contain an N-terminal KRAB box domain and 12 or 9 Krüppel C2H2 type zinc fingers at the C terminus, respectively. We found that sequences covering the Myc box II homology region are essential for the interaction with the Krim-1 proteins and that the second N-terminal zinc finger of Krim-1 is essential for Myc binding. Both Krim-1A and -B genes appear to be expressed ubiquitously with highest levels in spleen and lymph nodes. In particular, Krim-1B and, to a lesser extent, Krim-1A are able to decrease E-box-dependent transcriptional transactivation by c-Myc-Max complexes and also the ability of Myc to malignantly transform primary rat embryo fibroblasts, which is consistent with the functional repressive properties of their KRAB domains. The transcriptional corepressor Tif-1β is a binding partner for Krim-1 and stabilizes the protein. Our findings suggest that Myc-mediated functions can be negatively regulated by Krim-1, potentially in a complex with Tif-1β.

Our findings suggest that Myc-mediated functions can be negatively regulated by Krim-1, potentially in a complex with Tif-1β. c-Myc is a member of a family of nuclear phosphoproteins that comprise c-, N- and L-Myc. Whereas c-Myc is found in almost all proliferating cells, expression of N- and L-Myc is more restricted to specific cell types (for a review, see Refs. 1Lüscher B. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 277: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar and 2Amati B. Frank S.R. Donjerkovic D. Taubert S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: M135-M145Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). All three Myc family members have key roles in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. The c-Myc gene for instance is induced by serum stimulation in cultured cells as a typical immediate early response gene, and the c-Myc protein exerts part of its function by driving cells into S-phase, whereas a block of Myc function can lead to arrest of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (reviewed in Refs. 1Lüscher B. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 277: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar and 2Amati B. Frank S.R. Donjerkovic D. Taubert S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: M135-M145Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In a large number of human cancers, Myc family genes are transcriptionally activated either by gene amplification or specific chromosomal alterations (reviewed in Refs. 3Lutz W. Leon J. Eilers M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar and 4Adams J.M. Cory S. Cancer Surv. 1992; 15: 119-141PubMed Google Scholar). Myc is able to malignantly transform cells in culture either alone or in cooperation with other activated oncogenes such as Ha-ras (5Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, under growth factor deprivation, constitutive Myc expression can drive cells into apoptosis (programmed cell death) (6Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H.

Dev. 1994; 4: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It still remains controversial how the growth promoting and death promoting effects of Myc can be reconciled. A first picture how Myc family proteins might regulate gene expression has emerged through a number of experiments in recent years. All Myc family members contain a transactivation domain (TAD) 1The abbreviations used are: TAD, transactivation domain; RRS, Ras recruitment system; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid(s); REF, rat embryo fibroblast; b-HLH-LZip, basic helix loop helix-leucine zipper motif.1The abbreviations used are: TAD, transactivation domain; RRS, Ras recruitment system; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid(s); REF, rat embryo fibroblast; b-HLH-LZip, basic helix loop helix-leucine zipper motif. at the amino terminus and a basic region directly followed by a basic helix loop helix-leucine zipper motif (b-HLH-LZip) at its carboxyl terminus (8Lüscher B.

Science. 1990; 250: 1149-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The b-HLH-LZip domain is responsible for DNA binding and heterodimerization with partner proteins (8Lüscher B.

One of the known proteins that interact with Myc family members through this domain is the Max protein that also has a b-HLH-LZip domain (9Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N.

The Myc-Max complex specifically binds to E-box sequences with a preference for the sequence CACGTG (9Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 10Blackwell T.K. Kretzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1149-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The TAD of Myc contains two regions that are highly conserved in sequence among Myc family members and are termed Myc box I and II. Both homology regions appear indispensable for an optimal transcriptional transactivation (14Kato G.J. Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5914-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In addition to its activities as a transcriptional transactivator, high levels of Myc expression have been correlated with the down-regulation of a number of genes. The mechanisms for a direct transcriptional repression by Myc are less well understood but thought to be independent of E-box-mediated activation (15Yang B.S. Geddes T.J. Pogulis R.J. de Crombrugghe B. Freytag S.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2291-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Lee T.C. Li L. Philipson L. Ziff E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Data obtained to date suggest that Myc-mediated repression is the result of an interference with proteins binding to the initiator element (INR), which is part of the core promoter (18Claassen G.F. Hann S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9498-9503Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 19Shrivastava A. Saleque S. Kalpana G.V. Artandi S. Goff S.P. Calame K.

Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9498-9503Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 19Shrivastava A. Saleque S. Kalpana G.V. Artandi S. Goff S.P. Calame K.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), which transactivate target gene expression through INR binding. For instance, Miz-1-driven expression of INR-dependent reporter genes could be abrogated by Myc. To be effective as a transcriptional transactivator, the Myc-Max complex must recruit proteins with the ability to modify chromatin in order to allow installment and progression of the basic transcription machinery (reviewed in Refs. 1Lüscher B. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 277: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar and 2Amati B. Frank S.R. Donjerkovic D. Taubert S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: M135-M145Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Indeed, both histone acetyltransferases and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes (SWI/SNF) have been reported to associate with the Myc protein (23Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 24Cheng S.W.G. Davies K.P. Yung E. Beltran R.J. Yu J. Kaplana G.V. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It has been shown that TRRAP, a large protein that interacts with the N terminus of Myc, is part of a multiprotein complex with histone acetyltransferase activity (25McMahon S.B. Van Buskirk H.A.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Moreover, several other proteins are known today that interact with the Myc TAD and may be involved in the regulation of its activity: p107, Bin-1, and MM-1 (29Satou A. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46562-46567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Gu W. Bhatia K. Magrath I.T. Dang C.V. Dalla-Favera R.

Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Of particular interest in this respect is MM-1, which requires Myc box II sequences for binding to Myc. Most recently, it was demonstrated that MM-1 can bind to the transcriptional co-repressor Tif-1β, which is known to recruit the chromatin-associated factors HP-1 and histone deacetylases. This suggested a mechanism for Myc-mediated transcriptional repression (29Satou A. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46562-46567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Sakamuro D. Elliott K.J. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) that involves E-box-dependent gene regulation. In many cases, the isolation of Myc regulators has relied on yeast interaction cloning strategies (33Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Although the conventional yeast two-hybrid system has been very powerful in the isolation of protein-protein interaction partners in a number of cases, its use with transcription factors is limited, because their transcriptional activation domains strongly interfere with the transcriptional selection mechanism of the system itself. In our present study, we have used a novel yeast interaction cloning strategy, the Ras recruitment system (RRS) (34Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 35Aronheim A. Broder Y.C. Cohen A. Fritsch A. Belisle B. Abo A. Curr.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 47-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to identify proteins that bind to the TAD of Myc. The RRS selection mechanism is independent of transcriptional regulation and relies on the direct activation of the mitogenic Ras pathway in yeast cells (37Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the RRS, the sequence that is used as a bait to isolate a partner protein is cloned as a fusion protein with the human Ha-Ras protein (37Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression library that is to be screened with this “bait” encodes fusion proteins with the Src myristoylation signal, which will lead to attachment of these fusion proteins to the plasma membrane. If protein-protein interaction takes place, the bait-Ras fusion is recruited to the membrane and activates Ras-dependent signal transduction. This allows growth of a yeast mutant that is defective in this pathway due to a mutation in the endogenous Ras guanyl exchange factor Cdc25. Since no transactivation is needed to select for positive yeast clones, an endogenous transactivation property of the “bait” does not interfere with the selection process (37Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have used the 262 N-terminal amino acids of c-Myc as a bait in the RRS, and we were able to isolate a novel KRAB box-containing zinc finger protein, Krim-1, that binds to the Myc TAD and can negatively influence Myc functions. cdc25-2 yeast strain (a, ura3, lys2, leu2, trp1, cdc25-2, his3D200, ade101, GAL+) was transfected with the indicated plasmids and grown in minimal medium supplemented with the appropriate amino acids and nucleotides at 25 °C. To test for complementation, plates were replica-plated onto galactose minimal plates supplemented with amino acids and nucleotides lacking leucine and uracil and were grown at the nonpermissive temperature of 36 °C. All used yeast plasmids were derived from the galactose-inducible Yes2 (Invitrogen) and the constitutive ADNS vector. DNA fragments of c-Myc, c-Jun, and c-Fos to be inserted in frame to either Ha-Ras or the Src myristoylation sequence were generated by PCR. Yes2-derived Plasmids—Human c-Fos was fused to Src myristoylation signals (M-Fos). ADNS-derived Plasmids—Human c-Myc (amino acids 1–262; ADNS-Myc262–5′Ras) and human c-Jun leucine zipper (amino acids 249–331; JZ-5′Sos) were fused to Ras (amino acids 1–185) at the amino terminus. cDNA Library—Double-stranded cDNA was generated from poly(A)+ RNA of the GC rat pituitary cell line using random primer adapters and the ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). The cDNA was directionally ligated with Yes2 plasmid containing the Src myristoylation sequences. The library represents 2 × 106 primary transformants. To reduce the number of isolated Ras-containing clones from the library, the strain used for screening contained an expression plasmid with mammalian GAP (Ras GTPase-activating protein) (36Aronheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3373-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). RRS Library Screening with c-Myc262 Bait—Ras recruitment screening was performed essentially as described (37Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for the construction of the Myc262-RRS bait plasmid the transactivation domain of c-Myc corresponding to amino acids 1–262 was amplified by PCR from a human c-Myc cDNA. This fragment was subcloned in frame into HindIII/SmaI-cut plasmid pADNS-Ras(mut), containing Ha-Ras(L61) cDNA lacking the CAAX-farnesylation signal. Yeast transformation and manipulation was performed as described (36Aronheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3373-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used a cDNA expression library (34Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), constructed from mRNA of the GC cell line (rat pituitary tumor). To generate a bait strain, the Myc262 bait plasmid was cotransformed with the plasmid mGAP (36Aronheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3373-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) into the yeast strain cdc25-2 and grown at 25 °C on minimal medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. A starter culture from a single colony of this bait strain was grown in 100 ml of minimal medium, and then 2× 200 ml of YPAD medium was inoculated to A 600 = 0.4 and then grown at 25 °C for 4 h. Then 60 μg of library plasmid DNA were transformed into the bait strain and grown at 25 °C on agar plates with minimal medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and uracil for 3–4 days. For selection of clones with interacting protein pairs, cells were replica-plated to agar plates with galactose minimal medium (–leu, –trp, –ura) and grown at 36 °C for 6 days. These clones were streaked to glucose minimal medium (–leu, –trp, –ura), incubated at 25 °C for 3–4 days, and then tested for their dependence on expression from the galactose-inducible library plasmid. Colonies were replica-plated to agar plates containing galactose or glucose (both plates –leu, –trp, –ura) and grown for 3–4 days at 36 °C. Clones that showed glucose-repressible and galactose-inducible growth were used further for the isolation of the library plasmid. To test dependence on the bait, the isolated library plasmids were reintroduced into the cdc25-2 yeast strain in combinations with either the original screening bait or empty or a heterologous bait. One library clone was identified to confer growth in a Myc262 bait-specific manner at 36 °C. Ras Recruitment Screening with Krim-1 1–177 as a Bait—For RRS screening, a fragment with the N-terminal amino acids 1–177 of Krim-1 was amplified by PCR (primers: Krim bait-T (5′-GCATAAGCTTGCCGCCATGGAGCCAGTGACCTTTG-3′) and Krim bait-B (5′-ATACCCGGGATCGGAGGTGAAACTCCTAGATGCTTCG-3′); the Krim bait-B primer mutates an endogenous HindIII site silently). This fragment was inserted via HindIII/SmaI into the RRS bait vector pADNS-Ras-(mut) followed by introduction of this Krim-177-Ras bait plasmid and the mGAP expression plasmid into the yeast cdc25-2 strain. This bait strain was used for RRS screening of the GC cell cDNA expression library as described above. RRS Test of Internal Deletions of the Myc262 Bait—A series of CMV expression plasmids with internal deletions of c-Myc (“Mbox I” (Δ45–63); “large T/E1A” (Δ109–126); “E1A + Mbox II” (Δ104–136); “Mbox II” (Δ128–143)) and serine substitution mutants (residues 58 and 62 changed to Asp58/Asp62 or Ala58/Ala62) was used to obtain N-terminal fragments corresponding to c-Myc amino acids 1–262. These N-terminal fragments were amplified by PCR (primers: Myc-H3-ATG (5′-TAGAAGCTTACCATGCCCCTCAACGTTAGCTTC-3′) and Myc262-Sma-B (5′-TATCCCGGGGATTTCTTCCTCATCTTCTTG-3′)) and inserted as Hin-dIII/SmaI fragments into the RRS bait vector pADNS-Ras(mut) cut with the same restrictases. Each of these bait constructs was introduced with the Krim-1 cDNA library clone into cdc25-2 cells and tested for activation of the RRS at 36 °C. First strand cDNA preparation—For preparation of first strand cDNA, 5 μg of total RNA (from rat testis, bone marrow, or intestine) and 50 pmol of primer (for 5′-RACE, 5′-AAGGTCTCCTTCATCACGTC; for 3′-RACE dT17 adapter primer, 5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGA-T17) was mixed in 8.5 μl of reverse transcription buffer, and heated to 70 °C for 10 min. Then dithiothreitol, RNasin (20 units; Promega), and 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Superscript II; Invitrogen) was added in the recommended buffer. After incubation at 49 °C (1 h), reverse transcriptase was heat-inactivated (70 °C; 15 min) and incubated with 2 units of RNase H (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 20 min. This first strand cDNA preparation was purified on Qiaquick PCR purification spin columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and eluted in 50 μl of elution buffer. Only for 5′-RACE, this first strand cDNA was dA-tailed using 1 mm dATP, 15 units of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (Life Technologies) in a 75-μl volume (37 °C; 30 min) and then heat-inactivated (70 °C; 10 min). 5′-RACE Amplification—The missing 5′ region of the Krim-1 cDNA was obtained from dA-tailed cDNA by two-step amplification (“Synergy” Taq polymerase; Genecraft) using the common dT17 adapter primer and a nested pair of Krim-1-specific primers (step 1, 5′-AAGGTCTCCTTCATCACGTC; step 2, 5′-GAATCCAACATAGTCCACTC). The PCR products were purified after separation by agarose gel electrophoresis, blunted, and subcloned. The 3′-RACE products were obtained using dT17 adapter-primed cDNA as template. After two-step amplification using a common dT17 adapter primer and a pair of nested Krim-1-specific primers (step 1, 5′-CCTATTCCAGTGCTTGCTAT; step 2, 5′-CTTTCCCCAGATCCCTTCAC), the resulting PCR products were subcloned as described above. To generate full-length Krim-1A and -1B cDNAs, the insert of the Krim-1 library clone was assembled with the corresponding 3′-RACE fragments by ligation of partial HindIII-digested DNA fragments. Total RNA was isolated from various rat tissues by homogenization of the corresponding tissues in isothiocyanate buffer and subsequent column purification (RNeasy; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Then 4.5 μg of RNA were treated with 5 units of DNase (RNase-free DNase; Roche Applied Science) in 25 μl of first strand buffer for 20 min (25 °C). DNase digestion was terminated by the addition of 0.8 μl of 75 mm EDTA, and then 2 μl of random primer (hexamer; 200 ng/μl; Roche Applied Science) was added and immediately incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. This RNA was divided in two 12.5-μl samples for subsequent reverse transcription (with and without reverse transcriptase). To each sample, 2.5 μl of first strand buffer (5×; Promega), 0.5 μl of 60 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of 1 mm dNTPs, 0.5 μl of RNasin (20 units/μl; Promega), and 2 μl of H2O was added and mixed, followed by the addition of 1 μl of reverse transcriptase (Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase point mutant; 200 units/μl; Promega) to one sample and 1 μl of H2O to the other as negative control and subsequent incubation for 1 h at 49 °C. Samples were heat-treated (70 °C, 10 min) and digested with 1 μl of RNase H (1 unit/μl; TaKaRa) at 37 °C for 30 min. Real time PCR was performed using a GeneAmp 5700 SDS thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and SYBR Green Taq polymerase mix (SYBR Green PCR Master Mix; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Each amplification reaction contained 10 μl of SYBR Green Master Mix, 1 μl of cDNA, 0.5 μl of each primer (25 pmol/μl GAPDH primers or 100 pmol/μl Krim-1 primers), and 8 μl of H2O. Primer sequences were as follows: Krim-SQ4B (5′-GTGTCTCTCCGTTTTCCTTCATACC-3′), Krim-Y5-426T (5′-GAACTTCTTTGCGAAGACATGAAC-3′), rGA-PDH-T (5′-ATCCGTTGTGGATCTGACAT-3′), and rGAPDH-B (5′-ACCTG GTGCTCAGTGTAGCC-3′). For amplification, the following cycling parameters were used: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min and then 42 cycles with 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. After each experiment, the amplification product was analyzed by thermal dissociation for the generation of a single product. COS-7 cells or HeLa cells were plated on 90-mm dishes and transiently transfected with 12 μg of SR-HA-Krim and SP-c-Myc plasmids using 20 μl of the lipofection reagent Rotifect™ (Rotilab) or with the calcium phosphate technique. Cells were refed with complete medium after 6 h and were harvested after another 18 h. Cells were washed with PBS and then scraped off the plate in 400 μl of low salt lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors). Then the cells were completely disrupted by Dounce homogenization (30 strokes), centrifuged for 5 min (microcentrifuge; 3600 rpm, corresponding to 1000 × g). The cytosolic supernatant was discarded, and the remaining crude nuclear pellet was extracted with high salt lysis buffer (500 mm NaCl in low salt lysis buffer), and incubated for 10 min on ice. After adding an equal amount of low salt lysis buffer, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (microcentrifuge; 4 °C for 15 min). For immunoprecipitation, 8 μl of α-c-Myc polyclonal antibody (C-19; Santa Cruz) or 8 μl of α-Cdk4 polyclonal antibody (H-22; Santa Cruz) and 15 μl of protein A-agarose (50% slurry previously blocked in bovine serum albumin) was added to the lysate and rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation (2500 rpm; microcentrifuge; 4 °C) and washed four times with 1.3 ml of medium salt lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl in low salt lysis buffer). Then recovered proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal α-HA antibody (12CA5). For the preparation of affinity-purified glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, 400-ml cultures of Escherichia coli carrying the plasmids pGST-Myc 1–262, pGST-Jun 1–223 (kind gift from M. Karin, University of California San Diego), and pGEX4T2 (Promega) were grown to an A 600 = 0.5, induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to an end concentration of 0.2 mm, and grown for another 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (GSA, 4500 rpm, 4 °C), and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). After the addition of 30 μlof lysozyme (10 mg/ml), cells were incubated on ice for 45 min and sonicated (6 × 15 s with 30-s incubation on ice), and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation (JA-20; 9500 rpm; 4 °C). To the supernatant, 200 μlof GSH-agarose beads (50% slurry; Sigma) was added and incubated on a rocker platform for at least 4 h. GSH-agarose beads with bound proteins were washed three times with NETN-buffer. Protein concentration on GSH-beads was normalized to 20 μg of protein in 15 μl of GSH-beads by the addition of plain GSH-slurry. For in vitro binding reactions, 15 μlof GSH-agarose beads (with 20 μg of bound protein) was mixed with 400 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and 2.5 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated Krim-1 protein (2 μg of YM-Y5A Library-Plasmid; TNT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system; Promega). The binding reaction was incubated on a rocker platform for 1.5 h (4 °C) and washed five times with binding buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography"

ENTH domains comprise multiple α-helices folded upon each other to form a compact globular structure that has been implicated in interactions with lipids and proteins. In characterizing this evolutionarily conserved domain, we isolated and identified tubulin as an ENTH domain-binding partner. The interaction, which is direct and has a dissociation constant of ∼1 μm, was observed with ENTH domains of proteins present in various species. Tubulin is co-immunoprecipitated from rat brain extracts with the ENTH domain-containing proteins, epsins 1 and 2, and punctate epsin staining is observed along the microtubule cytoskeleton of dissociated cortical neurons. Consistent with a role in microtubule processes, the over-expression of epsin ENTH domain in PC12 cells stimulates neurite outgrowth.

Adaptor protein 180 (AP180), clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein (CALM), Huntingtin-interacting protein-1 (HIP1) and HIP12, and the yeast proteins yAP180 and Sla2p contain a module that is so similar in structure to the epsin ENTH domain that they were initially denoted ENTH-bearing proteins (11Hyman J.

However, recent structural studies have refined our understanding such that ENTH-like domains from these proteins have been re-designated ANTH domain-containing proteins in accordance with their higher structural similarity to AP180 rather than epsin (14Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). In an effort to simplify the nomenclature applied in this study, we refer to these homologous structures as E/ANTH domains when collectively discussing proteins bearing either domain, but maintain the ENTH or ANTH nomenclature when discussing individual proteins.A common feature among many E/ANTH domain-bearing proteins is that their C termini contain peptide motifs, indicative of a functional role in clathrin-mediated membrane budding including clathrin and clathrin adaptor protein-binding elements (1Kay B.K. Yamabhai M. Wendland B. Emr S.D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15De Camilli P. Chen H. Hyman J. Panepucci E. Bateman A. Brunger A.T.

In addition to their interactions with multiple endocytic components, many of the currently characterized E/ANTH proteins, including epsin, AP180, and HIP1/12, are localized to clathrin-coated pits where they function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (2Chen H.

Interestingly, enthoprotin is unique in this group because it is predominantly localized to the trans-Golgi network rather than the plasma membrane, and it appears to regulate clathrin-mediated budding events occurring specifically along the trans-Golgi network and endosomal pathway (4Wasiak S.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Recent studies have demonstrated that the E/ANTH domains of epsin and AP180 can mediate lipid binding, particularly to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), and that this interaction is required for efficient clathrin-mediated endocytosis in COS-7 cells (12Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 13Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Furthermore, upon PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding, the epsin ENTH domain was shown to drive the curvature of clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane, whereas the AP180 ANTH domain appears to be more involved in regulating the diameter of emergent vesicles (14Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). This functional difference in ENTH and ANTH domains is likely imparted by the structural variances between them. In the AP180 ANTH domain, the specific residues involved in lipid binding reside within α-helices α1 and α2 and in the loop between them (12Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 13Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T.

However, the epsin ENTH domain lipid-ligand pocket is coordinated by residues in α1, the α1–2 loop, α3, and α4 and is dependent on the formation and binding of α0, a helix that is not present or generated in the ANTH domain (12Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 13Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A.

Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The importance of helix α0 for epsin ENTH domain function is demonstrated by the fact that deletion or mutation of residues within this helix is sufficient to abrogate lipid interactions (12Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and abolish the ability of mammalian epsin ENTH to induce curvature of clathrin-coated membrane lattices (14Ford M.G.

Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar).E/ANTH domains function in clathrin-mediated budding not only in higher order organisms but also in budding yeast. Genetic experiments demonstrate that the ENTH domains of the yeast epsin homologues Ent1p and Ent2p are essential for normal endocytic function and actin cytoskeletal structure, and expression of at least one ENTH domain is required to maintain viability in Ent1 and Ent2 double mutant strains (Ent1ΔEnt2Δ) (8Wendland B. Steece K.E. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4383-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Wendland B. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, the essential function of yeast epsin ENTH domains in Ent1pΔEnt2Δ mutants appears to be independent of their ability to bind lipids (26Aguilar R.C. Watson H.A. Wendland B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 93aGoogle Scholar). Specifically, Aguilar et al. (26Aguilar R.C. Watson H.A. Wendland B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 93aGoogle Scholar) have identified an ENTH domain mutant that fails to rescue Ent1ΔEnt2Δ cells despite the fact that this mutant continues to bind PtdIns(4,5)P2. Based on these findings, the authors suggest that at least in yeast, another critical protein-binding partner(s) must exist to assist ENTH domain functions (26Aguilar R.C. Watson H.A. Wendland B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 93aGoogle Scholar). In fact, previous studies into the function of this module have revealed that ENTH domains can mediate interactions with proteins; the ENTH domain of mammalian epsin 1 binds weakly to the vesicular coat protein coatomer and more robustly to human promyelocytic leukemia Zn2+ finger protein (PLZF), a transcriptional repressor (11Hyman J. Chen H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Together these studies suggest multiple roles for the ENTH domain as both a lipid- and protein-binding module.As part of our functional analyses of the ENTH domain, we sought to identify new protein targets for this module. Through affinity selection assays, we identified tubulin as a binding partner for E/ANTH domains isolated from several different species. We propose that interaction with tubulin is an evolutionarily conserved property of E/ANTH domains.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Polyclonal antibodies for epsins 1 and 2 were prepared by injecting two rabbits (denoted as 2345 and 2346) with 50 μg of GST fusion protein encoding the C-terminal 511 amino acids of mouse epsin 2 (formerly referred to as intersectin-binding protein 2) (27Yamabhai M.

PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and subcloned into either the corresponding sites of pGEX-4T1 to generate GST-Epsin ENTH (amino acids 1–146), and GST-AP180 ANTH (amino acids 2–288) or the EcoRI and SalI sites of pEGFP-C2 for generation of GFP-Epsin (amino acids 1–553) GFP-Epsin ΔENTH (amino acids 147–553) and GFP-AP180 ANTH (amino acids 2–288) constructs. A GFP-Epsin ENTH (amino acids 1–208) construct was generated by PCR amplification and cloning into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-C2. Rat epsin 1 α-helices α1–2 (amino acids 19–47), α2–3 (amino acids 37–65), α3–4 (amino acids 50–86), and α7 (amino acids 112–129) were generated by PCR amplification and cloning into BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T1 or into BglII and EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1 to generate GST- and GFP-tagged constructs, respectively. AP180 α7 (amino acids 115–141) was generated by PCR amplification and cloning into BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T1 or into BglII and SalI sites of pEGFP-C2. All expression constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. GST fusion proteins were over-expressed in bacteria and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).Affinity Selection Assays—Rat brains were homogenized in buffer A (10 mm HEPES-OH, pH 7.4, 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged a second time at 205,000 × g for 30 min to recover the soluble fraction. After adding Triton X-100 (1% final concentration) to the supernatant, aliquots (2 mg protein) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose bound to ∼25 μg of the GST fusion protein constructs. Beads were extensively washed in buffer A with 1% Triton X-100, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or by Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies to α- or βIII-tubulin. In other experiments, purified tubulin, made free of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) by phosphocellulose chromatography (ICN Biomedicals), was diluted to 200 nm in 4 °C buffer B (0.1 m MES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C at 100,000 × g to remove insoluble aggregates. Aliquots (1 ml) of the supernatant were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with ∼25 μg of GST fusion proteins (pre-coupled to glutathione-Sepharose), the samples were washed in buffer B, and material bound to the beads was resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blot analysis.Tubulin Binding Affinity Measurements—Purified tubulin was diluted to 10 μm in binding buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm GTP, 10% glycerol) and incubated for 30 min on ice. The sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g to remove insoluble aggregates. Aliquots of the supernatant, diluted in binding buffer to final concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 4 μm, were added to 10 μg of GST fusion protein constructs pre-coupled to glutathione-Sepharose in a final reaction volume of 250 μlfor4hat4 °C. The samples were washed in binding buffer, and material bound to the beads was resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blot analysis along with a standard curve of purified tubulin. Following Western blot with α-tubulin or βIII-tubulin antibodies, the amount of either tubulin retained by the beads was determined by scanning the blots and comparing the optical density to that of the standard curve using NIH Image computer software.ENTH Domain Binding to Taxol-stabilized Microtubules—The binding of ENTH domain to microtubules was assessed using a microtubule-associated protein spin-down assay kit (Cytoskeleton Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, highly purified tubulin (50 μm) in PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2) was incubated for 20 min at 35 °C in the presence of 1 mm GTP and 2% sucrose to allow for microtubule formation. The sample was then diluted 1:10 in PEM buffer with 1 mm GTP and 40 μm taxol. Aliquots of the taxol-stabilized microtubules (20 μl) were added to purified MAP-2, bovine serum albumin (both supplied by the manufacturer), or purified GST fusion protein constructs (pre-spun for 40 min at 100,000 × g to remove insoluble aggregates), each diluted to 30 μl in PEM buffer with 1 mm GTP and 40 μm taxol. Triton X-100 was added to each 50 μl sample to 1% final, and the samples were then incubated for 20 min at room temperature before being loaded onto 50 μl of cushion buffer (PEM, 20% sucrose, 20 μm taxol). The samples were spun at 25 °C for 40 min 100,000 × g, the upper 50 μl sample was retained, the cushion was carefully removed, and the pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer.Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cortical neurons dissected from embryonic day (E) 15–16 mice were titurated, plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, and maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 1× B27 (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin as described (36Bhakar A.L. Tannis L.L. Zeindler C. Pia Russo M. Jobin C. Park D.S. McPherson S. Barker P.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8466-8475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PC12 cells plated on rat tail collagen-coated coverslips were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and maintained In Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum, 10% horse serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Prior to fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde, cells were rinsed twice with room temperature phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). In the case of cortical neurons, cells were fixed after 3 days of in vitro culture, whereas PC12 cells were fixed 5 days following transfection; in both cases cells were maintained in their particular medium throughout their respective culturing periods. Fixed cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence with various antibodies and for direct immunofluorescence with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin as described (37Lamarche-Vane N. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29172-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Images of cortical neurons and PC12 cells were captured using a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Transfected PC12 cells bearing neurites were quantified in four experiments as the ratio of transfected cells with processes greater than one cell body relative to the total population of transfected cellsImmunoprecipitation Analysis—A soluble rat brain extract, prepared as described above, was pre-cleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C and then was incubated with rabbit anti-epsin 2 antisera (2345 and 2346) coupled to protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed with buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blot analysis.RESULTSIdentification of Tubulin as an ENTH Domain-interacting Protein—In an effort to identify proteins that interact with the ENTH domain (1Kay B.K. Yamabhai M. Wendland B. Emr S.D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) we performed affinity chromatography on rat brain extracts using GST fusion constructs encoding the ENTH domains of Af10 and MP90. Af10, isolated from Avena fatua, is a protein of unknown function (3Jones H.D. Smith S.J. Desikan R. Plakidou-Dymock S. Lovegrove A. Hooley R. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and MP90, originally identified as a mitotic phosphoprotein present in Xenopus laevis embryos (33Stukenberg P.T. Lustig K.D. McGarry T.J. King R.W. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), is a member of the epsin family of proteins. Pull-down experiments with these two fusion proteins, followed by detection of bound proteins with Coomassie Blue staining, revealed the selective purification of a 55-kDa protein species (Fig. 1). Based on the size and abundance of the affinity-selected protein, we predicted that it might be tubulin. To explore this hypothesis, we performed pull-down experiments with GST fusions to the ENTH domain of rat epsin 1, a variety of modular domains including Src homology 3 (SH3), Dbl homology (DH), pleckstrin homology (PH), and C2 domains, and a protein fragment encoding the pentapeptide TNPFL. Affinity-selected proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the α-isoform of αβ-tubulin heterodimers. Only the ENTH domain-containing GST fusion protein bound α-tubulin (Fig. 2). These data confirm that α-tubulin binds the ENTH domain of epsin and demonstrate the specificity of the interaction compared with other modular domains and peptides. The GST-Af10-ENTH domain also selectively recovered α-tubulin from soluble extracts prepared from rat testis, liver, and heart and from COS-7 and A431 cell lines (data not shown), demonstrating that ENTH domains can interact with α-tubulin present in a broad range of tissues.Fig. 2ENTH domains bind tubulin from rat brain extracts. Approximately 30 μg of GST alone, GST fused to the pentapeptide motif TNPFL (GST-NPFL), GST-epsin ENTH, GST-intersectin SH3A, GST-amphiphysin II SH3, GST-intersectin-l C2, GST-intersectin-l DH-PH, and GST-intersectin-l DH were pre-coupled to glutathione-Sepharose and used in binding assays with soluble rat brain (S3) extracts. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tubulin Binding Is Direct and Conserve"

The polypeptide chain comprises 296 residues and wraps around nine hemes of type c. It is believed to take part in the periplasmic assembly of proteins involved in the mechanism of hydrogen cycling, receiving electrons from the tetraheme cytochrome c 3. With the purpose of understanding the molecular basis of electron transfer processes in this cytochrome, we have determined the crystal structures of its oxidized and reduced forms at pH 7.5 and performed theoretical calculations of the binding equilibrium of protons and electrons in these structures. This integrated study allowed us to observe that the reduction process induced relevant conformational changes in several residues, as well as protonation changes in some protonatable residues. In particular, the surroundings of hemes I and IV constitute two areas of special interest. In addition, we were able to ascertain the groups involved in the redox-Bohr effect present in this cytochrome and the conformational changes that may underlie the redox-cooperativity effects on different hemes. Furthermore, the thermodynamic simulations provide evidence that the N- and C-terminal domains function in an independent manner, with the hemes belonging to the N-terminal domain showing, in general, a lower redox potential than those found in the C-terminal domain. In this way, electrons captured by the N-terminal domain could easily flow to the C-terminal domain, allowing the former to capture more electrons. A notable exception is heme IX, which has low redox potential and could serve as the exit path for electrons toward other proteins in the electron transfer pathway..

Protein electron transfer is a key process in metabolic chains. Usually, proteins involved in these chains, bearing one or more redox centers, show a high degree of complexity, which makes the understanding of the molecular basis of such processes a difficult task. Nevertheless, the knowledge of an increasing number of three-dimensional structures of such proteins in different redox states has helped, to a certain extent, to overcome this limitation. For instance, in the large multicenter redox enzyme cytochrome c oxidase, the knowledge of the crystal structure from different sources and in different redox states, as well as with different bound ligands (1Iwata S.

When analyzing the effects of reduction using structures in different oxidation states, it is important to obtain these structures under controlled conditions, where the effects we want to study are evident, so that clear, significant, and interpretable differences can be observed.

The structures that we determined at pH 7.6, together with the results from theoretical calculations, allowed us to identify the groups related to the redox-Bohr and positive cooperativity effects and understand, in this way, which are the key features that underlie the mechanism of electron transfer in this cytochrome. In conclusion, the study of simpler systems still constitutes an important and valuable contribution for the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the electron transfer process or even other types of processes associated with electron transfer. One of these systems is the nine-heme cytochrome c (9HcA) from DdA. It is a c-type cytochrome, with a molecular mass around 37 kDa, 296 residues, and nine heme groups covalently bound to the polypeptide chain. Eight of these nine hemes are arranged in two tetraheme c 3-like domains, with the extra, isolated heme located in between (26Matias P.M. Saraiva L.M. Soares C.M. Coelho A.V. LeGall J.

The four proteins that compose this putative redox complex (9Hc) are similar in sequence to four of the proteins identified in another related redox complex, the Hmc complex (HmcB, HmcC, HmcD, HmcE, and HmcF), isolated from D. vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) (31Matias P.M.

The most correct way to model coupling between reduction and protonation in proteins is to use methods introduced by us (42Baptista A.M. Martel P.J. Soares C.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2978-2998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that model the joint binding equilibrium of electrons and protons in proteins, using Monte Carlo techniques.

Multiheme cytochromes c 3 were extensively characterized using these theoretical methodologies aiming to understand coupling phenomena (10Louro R.O. Bento I. Matias P.M. Catarino T. Baptista A.M.

However, one limitation of the majority of these studies is the fact that only one conformation (x-ray structure) is used to characterize all possible states of the system, which is a significant simplification that leaves out the possibility that specific reorganization effects of reduction and protonation may occur. We reported recently (10Louro R.O. Bento I. Matias P.M. Catarino T. Baptista A.M. Soares C.M. Carrondo M.A. Turner D.L. Xavier A.V. J. Biol.

Genet., in pressGoogle Scholar) studies that considered two x-ray structures (in the oxidized and reduced states) to understand protein reorganization effects and the way these influence the reduction and protonation phenomena in cytochrome c 3. This procedure was clearly better than previous approaches and allowed us to characterize very important effects in this redox protein, such as the phenomenon of positive cooperativity. This is the approach that we propose to follow here with 9HcA. In the present work, we report the crystal structure of the oxidized and reduced forms of 9HcA from DdA at pH 7.5 and results obtained from theoretical studies based on these structures. This integrated study allowed the identification of the groups directly involved in the redox-Bohr effect. Similarly to what happens in the previously mentioned case of the tetraheme cytochrome c 3, it was possible to provide evidence of the presence of positive cooperativity in reduction in this cytochrome and to identify the groups involved. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of the oxidized form of 9HcA were obtained at pH 7.5 under conditions similar to those described previously (46Coelho A.V. Matias P.M. Carrondo M.A. Tavares P. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. Fülop V. Hajdu J. LeGall J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1189-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These crystals were then reduced with an excess of sodium dithionite that was added to the crystallization drop; the reduction process was followed by the change in the color of the crystal, from an initial red to a final pink-red. Color homogeneity was reached after about 5 min, an indication that the process was complete. Nevertheless, the crystals were still allowed to stay under these conditions for another 10 min, after which they were immediately harvested and flash-frozen, using a cryoprotecting solution containing 20% glycerol, 80% of the crystallization solution, and an excess of sodium dithionite. Two data sets were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, at 110 K: one from a crystal of the oxidized form, and another from a crystal of the reduced form. Both data sets were processed with the DENZO/SCALEPACK program (47Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology, Macromolecular Crystallography. part A. Vol. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar), and the statistics obtained are listed in Table I. The crystals belong to the monoclinic space group, P21, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The data set obtained from the oxidized crystal had a maximum resolution of 1.5 Å, whereas that obtained from the reduced crystal had a maximum resolution of 2.0 Å.Table ISummary of data collection and processing statisticsOxidation stateReducedOxidizedX-ray sourceBM14 (ESRFaESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility.-Grenoble)ID14-EH2 (ESRFaESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility.-Grenoble)Wavelength, Å0.7990.993Space groupP21Unit cell (Å, °)a = 60.40, b = 105.66, c = 80.94, β = 103.35a = 60.30, b = 105.95, c = 80.37, β = 103.18No. of molecules in a.u.ba.u., arbitrary units.

Open table in a new tab It has been shown that a prolonged exposure to a high-flux Synchrotron radiation beam may induce reduction in some crystal structures, such as horseradish peroxidase (48Berglund G.I. Carlsson G.H. Smith A.T. Szoke H. Henriksen A. Hajdu J. Nature. 2002; 417: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Because our high resolution (1.5 Å) diffraction data of the oxidized form of 9HcA at pH 7.5 were obtained from low-symmetry crystals (space group P21), such an x-ray-induced reduction effect might be possible and, as such, partially mask the structural differences described below between the oxidized and reduced forms of 9HcA. However, we do not believe this to be the case in the present study, because the total x-ray exposure time was rather short (22 min). Structural Refinement—Initial phases for the data sets were determined by the molecular replacement (MR) method, using the program AmoRe (49Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) and using as a search model the previously determined three-dimensional structure of the oxidized form of 9HcA at pH 5.5 (26Matias P.M.

The MR solution found for the oxidized data had a correlation coefficient of 64.4% and an R factor of 33%, and that for the reduced form had a correlation coefficient of 70.1% and an R factor of 31.2%. In both cases, the data used in the MR calculations had a resolution of 2.5 Å. Both structural models (oxidized and reduced) were then refined using as refinement programs XPLOR (50Brunger A.T. XPLOR- A System for Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) and SHELXL (51Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). The refinement of the reduced structure started with a simulated annealing refinement at 3000 K, using data up to 2.5 Å resolution, with X-PLOR followed by an overall B-factor refinement. Another simulated annealing refinement was done introducing all data, up to 2 Å resolution, followed by a B-group refinement and an individual B-factor refinement. At this stage, 2|Fo | –|Fc | and|Fo | –|Fc | σA-weighted electron density maps were calculated, and the structural model obtained was checked and corrected in a 3D-graphics work station using TURBO-FRODO (52Roussel A. Fontecilla-Camps D.C. Cambilau C. in XV International Union of Crystallography Abstracts. Bordeaux, France1989: 66-67Google Scholar). The refinement proceeded with SHELXL (51Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Initially, non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were imposed on the complete molecule, but as the refinement progressed, the non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were confined to those regions where the non-crystallographic symmetry was actually observed. The solvent model was constructed using Arp/Warp (53Lamzin V.S. Wilson K. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2083018502,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes involved in fatty acid degradation contain in their promoters oleate response elements (OREs) and type 1 upstream activation sequences (UAS1s) that bind Pip2p-Oaf1p and Adr1p, respectively. The promoter of the PIP2 gene was found to contain a potential UAS1 that consists of a tandem array of CYCCRR half-sites in an overlapping arrangement with a previously characterized ORE. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that Adr1p bound to UAS1PIP2, and Northern analysis in combination with a lacZ reporter gene confirmed that Adr1p influenced the transcription of PIP2. Immunoprecipitation showed that, in adr1Δ mutant cells grown on oleic acid, Pip2p was less abundant compared with the corresponding wild-type. In addition, the amount of Pip2p-Oaf1p that bound to a target ORE in vitro was reduced in mutant extracts compared with the wild-type. Transcription of the oleic acid-inducible genes SPS19 and CTA1, which rely on both Pip2p-Oaf1p and Adr1p for their regulation, was reduced in adr1Δ mutant cells. However, by ectopically restoring levels of Pip2p in adr1Δ cells grown on oleic acid medium, transcription of both genes increased 2-fold compared with the control. This partial suppression of the adr1Δ mutant phenotype was additionally manifested by moderate utilization of oleic acid. Hence, both the expression as well as the action of the two transcription factors, Adr1p and Pip2p-Oaf1p, are interconnected, which allows for an elaborate control of fatty acid-inducible genes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes involved in fatty acid degradation contain in their promoters oleate response elements (OREs) and type 1 upstream activation sequences (UAS1s) that bind Pip2p-Oaf1p and Adr1p, respectively.

Immunoprecipitation showed that, in adr1Δ mutant cells grown on oleic acid, Pip2p was less abundant compared with the corresponding wild-type. In addition, the amount of Pip2p-Oaf1p that bound to a target ORE in vitro was reduced in mutant extracts compared with the wild-type. Transcription of the oleic acid-inducible genes SPS19 and CTA1, which rely on both Pip2p-Oaf1p and Adr1p for their regulation, was reduced in adr1Δ mutant cells. However, by ectopically restoring levels of Pip2p in adr1Δ cells grown on oleic acid medium, transcription of both genes increased 2-fold compared with the control. This partial suppression of the adr1Δ mutant phenotype was additionally manifested by moderate utilization of oleic acid. Hence, both the expression as well as the action of the two transcription factors, Adr1p and Pip2p-Oaf1p, are interconnected, which allows for an elaborate control of fatty acid-inducible genes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells growing on fatty acids as a sole carbon source induce the transcription of a suite of genes by 2–10-fold (1Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B.

The ORE consensus sequence has recently been refined to comprise CGGN3TNA/(R)N8–12CCG (10Rottensteiner H. Hartig A. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Erdmann R. Gurvitz A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2013-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition to containing an ORE, the promoters of several fatty acid-responsive genes also have a type 1 upstream activation sequence (UAS1) that acts as target for the Adr1p transcription factor (11Simon M. Binder M. Adam G. Hartig A. Ruis H. Yeast. 1992; 8: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The UAS1 consensus sequence consists of CYCCR(A/T/G)N4–36(T/A/C)YGGRG (12Cheng C.

Adr1p has been identified previously as a regulator of the glucose-repressible alcohol dehydrogenase gene ADH2 (13Ciriacy M. Mol. Gen.

Adr1p was subsequently shown to regulate directly the transcription of the ORE-dependent genes CTA1, SPS19, and POX1 (15Simon M. Adam G. Rapatz W. Spevak W. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Gurvitz A. Wabnegger L. Rottensteiner H. Dawes I.W. Hartig A. Ruis H. Hamilton B. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31825-31830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Investigations into the expression of SPS19 and POX1 have exposed a strict adherence to regulation by both Adr1p and Pip2p-Oaf1p. The fact that Pox1p represents peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase, which is the first and the rate-limiting enzyme of the β-oxidation spiral, elucidated the reason for the requirement for Adr1p during the growth of yeast cells on fatty acids (Ref. 19Gurvitz A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31825-31830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, and references therein). The promoters of these two genes exhibit an ORE/UAS1 overlap, which is postulated to be significant for transcriptional up-regulation. Studies on this type of overlap in the CTA1 promoter revealed a synergy between the oleic acid-specific Pip2p-Oaf1p transcription factor and the more general sensor of less favored carbon sources, Adr1p (19Gurvitz A.

Several mechanisms ensure that Adr1p initiates transcription of its target genes only in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources. With respect to ORE-regulated genes, chromatin immunoprecipitations revealed that Adr1p binds to the UAS1 of CTA1 and POT1/FOX3 in vivo but does so only in the absence of glucose (20Young E.T. Kacherovsky N. Van Riper K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38095-38103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Pip2p-Oaf1p is also tightly regulated by multiple layers of control. Although glucose inhibition is a feature common to both partners of this transcription factor, activation of the constitutively expressed Oaf1p depends on fatty acids (21Baumgartner U. Hamilton B. Piskacek M. Ruis H. Rottensteiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22208-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas PIP2 transcription is thought to be primarily regulated in response to its own abundance through an autoregulatory loop based on an ORE in the promoter of the PIP2 gene (21Baumgartner U. Hamilton B. Piskacek M. Ruis H. Rottensteiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22208-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A potential ORE/UAS1 overlap has since been identified in the promoter of PIP2 (19Gurvitz A. Hiltunen J.K. Erdmann R. Hamilton B. Hartig A. Ruis H. Rottensteiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31825-31830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which raises the issue of the relationship between Adr1p and Pip2p-Oaf1p with respect to bulk gene transcription in cells grown on oleic acid. Here, the role of Adr1p in regulating PIP2 was investigated, and the results are discussed in terms of a transcriptional program that culminates in the induction of genes involved in fatty acid breakdown. Strains, Plasmids, and Oligonucleotides—The Escherichia coli strain DH10B was used for all plasmid amplifications and isolations as well as for producing recombinant Adr1p-LacZ from plasmid pQC-A229Z (22Eisen A. Taylor W.E. Blumberg H. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4552-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). References for the S. cerevisiae strains used are listed in Table I, and references for the plasmids and oligonucleotides are in Table II. Strains yAG1250 through yAG1253 were generated by transforming BJ1991pip2Δ or the corresponding adr1Δ cells expressing SPS19-lacZ from pAG454 (yAG485 and yAG1045) with either YCplac22 or pTPI1-PIP2HA3, respectively. For expressing PIP2 ectopically, cells were transformed with plasmid pTPI1-PIP2. Construction of GA1–8C-based strains MF14 and MF14adr1Δ or BJ1991pip2Δ and BJ1991pip2Δoaf1Δ has been described. The deletion of the PIP2 gene in strain MF14 was performed previously. Strain BJ1991adr1Δ was a gift from Dr. H. F. Tabak's laboratory.

The nucleotides of all cloned inserts were confirmed by automatic sequencing. Plasmid pHPR184 was created by exchanging the ClaI-SalI fragment of pHPR183 with that of pYIMPIP2-HA3, followed by an exchange of the NotI-demarcated hemagglutinin A epitope cassette with a similarly delineated cassette containing the sequence for 9× Myc. Media and Growth Conditions—Production of Adr1p-LacZ in E. coli cells was performed as described (22Eisen A. Taylor W.E. Blumberg H. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4552-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For RNA isolations, cultures of the wild-type strain MF14 or the otherwise isogenic mutants devoid of Adr1p or Pip2p were shifted to YP medium (1% w/v yeast extract, 2% w/v peptone) containing the indicated carbon sources and grown for a further 16 h (1Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B. Tabak H.F. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For β-galactosidase measurements, cells were induced in oleic acid medium as follows. Late exponential phase cells from overnight pre-cultures consisting of YP medium and 5% (w/v) d-glucose were transferred to 100-ml conical flasks with 50 ml of YP medium containing both 0.2% (w/v) oleic acid (Merck) and 0.02% (w/v) Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich) that were adjusted to pH 7.0 with NaOH, 0.05% d-glucose, and 75 μg/ml ampicillin to an absorbance of A 600 = 0.2. Cultures were grown at 30 °C with vigorous aeration for the periods indicated. For immunoblotting, BJ1991 wild-type cells and otherwise isogenic adr1Δ and pip2Δoaf1Δ mutants were grown in liquid YP medium containing 2% d-glucose and shifted to YP media supplemented with either 4% d-glucose, 2% (v/v) ethanol, or pH-adjusted 0.2% oleic acid and 0.02% Tween 80. Cultures were aerated vigorously for 8 h in the case of cells grown on glucose (to A 600 < 1.0) and for 20 h in the cases of growth on ethanol or oleic acid. For assays using culture drops, cells were grown in liquid rich glucose YPD medium (YP and 2% d-glucose) overnight to late exponential phase, diluted serially, and applied to solid YPD medium solidified with 2% (w/v) agar. For qualitative estimates of β-galactosidase expression levels on solid YPD medium, 50 μl of 4% (w/v) 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) in dimethyl formamide was added to the plates. Oleic acid plates contained a 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base with amino acids added, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.5% (w/v) potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.0, 2% agar, autoclaved with 0.5% Tween 80 and 0.125% oleic acid. Plates were prepared by pouring a thin layer at 55 °C. These were used to assess fatty acid breakdown by clear zone formation. Enzyme Assays, Protein Extract Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—β-Galactosidase activities were assayed in soluble protein extracts prepared by breaking cells with glass beads (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) and expressed as nanomole of O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolyzed per minute and milligram of protein. Catalase measurements were performed as described (27Beers R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, values reported here are the average of three experiments ± S.D. Whole-cell extracts were prepared according to a published protocol (28Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Preparation of soluble protein extracts and immunoprecipitation of a Myc-tagged protein were performed essentially as described (29Stein K. Schell-Steven A. Erdmann R. Rottensteiner H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6056-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, soluble protein extracts obtained from yeast cells (2 g wet weight) were incubated with Dynabeads goat anti-mouse IgG (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) coated with anti-Myc (9E10) antibodies. Following triple washing, the beads were boiled in 50 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer. The anti-Kar2p antibody was described previously (30Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The polyclonal rabbit antibody against Cta1p was a gift from Dr. H. F. Tabak, and the monoclonal antibody 9E10 (c-myc) was obtained from Berkeley Antibody, Richmond, CA. Immunoreactive complexes were visualized using anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase in combination with the ECL™ system from Amersham Biosciences. Miscellaneous—The following procedures were performed according to published methods: nucleic acid manipulations, formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, blotting and hybridization (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), yeast transformation (32Chen D.-C. Yang B.-C.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fragments containing UAS1CTA1, UAS1PIP2, or FOX3 ORE were isolated from plasmids pLW81, pLW82, and pSKFOX3ORE (Table II), respectively, following digestion with EcoRI and XhoI. DNA fragment isolations were performed using QIAEX II (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The [α-32P]dATP-labeled probes were generated with a Prime-a-Gene™ random primer labeling kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) was carried out according to a published protocol (1Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B. Tabak H.F. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). UAS1 PIP2 Binds Adr1p in Vitro—The PIP2 promoter contains a potential UAS1 that could be important for the expression of the corresponding gene (Fig. 1A). The nucleotide sequence of UAS1PIP2 resembles that in the promoter of the GUT1 gene (37Pavlik P. Simon M. Schuster T. Ruis H. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which similarly consists of two single Adr1p-binding half-sites ordered as a tandem repeat (38Grauslund M. Lopes J.M. Rønnow B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4391-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To examine whether UAS1PIP2 could interact with Adr1p, EMSAs were performed on a fragment representing this promoter element as well as on the analogous sequence in the CTA1 promoter, UAS1CTA1. Incubation of labeled UAS1CTA1 with recombinant Adr1p-LacZ formed a high molecular weight complex (Fig. 1B, lane 2) that was specific to Adr1p elements, because the addition of excessive amounts of UAS1CTA1 (Fig. 1B, lane 3) or the corresponding element in the ADH2 promoter (18Gurvitz A. Wabnegger L. Rottensteiner H. Dawes I.W. Hartig A. Ruis H. Hamilton B. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 4: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), UAS1ADH2 (Fig. 1B, lane 4), caused the intensity of the signal due to this complex to diminish. The results also showed that the intensity of the Adr1p signal could be reduced following the addition of excess DNA representing UAS1PIP2 (Fig. 1B, lane 5), although this reduction was less pronounced compared with those associated with UAS1CTA1 and UAS1ADH2. On the other hand, excess PIP2 ORE, which flanks the half-site of UAS1PIP2 (Fig. 1A), did not weaken the signal's intensity (Fig. 1B, lane 6). UAS1PIP2 could also be shown to be targeted directly by Adr1p (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–12). The top two bands seen in Fig. 1B, lane 2 (marked with arrows and asterisks) were reasoned to not represent genuine complexes because they could be competed by a nonspecific competitor DNA that failed to reduce the signal of the predominant complex (Fig. 1B, lane 6). Hence, EMSAs performed using a recombinant Adr1p-LacZ fusion protein revealed that UAS1PIP2 was able to recruit the transcription factor in vitro. Adr1p Influences PIP2 Transcription on Oleic Acid—Northern analysis was performed to determine whether Adr1p actually affected PIP2 transcription (Fig. 2A). The results demonstrated that levels of PIP2 transcripts were higher in wild-type cells grown on oleic acid medium compared with the situation on ethanol (Fig. 2A; top pair of panels), albeit the PIP2 signal was weaker compared with those corresponding to the two peroxisomal enzyme genes, POT1/FOX3 and CTA1. Nevertheless, the Northern blot could expose a reduction in the transcription of PIP2 by the adr1Δ mutant under oleic acid medium conditions (Fig. 2A, top right hand panel) even when considering the moderately unequal loading seen using ACT1 (encoding actin), which served as a control gene that is not affected by Adr1p (Fig. 2A, bottom pair of panels). Hence, the reduced PIP2 signal resembled the situation with the two Adr1p-dependent positive control genes (11Simon M. Binder M. Adam G. Hartig A. Ruis H. Yeast. 1992; 8: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Igual J.C. Navarro B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 446-455PubMed Google Scholar) seen in the middle panels. Regulation of PIP2 was also investigated in response to excess levels of Adr1p (Fig. 2B). Multiple ADR1 copies have been reported previously to result in increased transcription of certain genes whose promoters contain a UAS1, including ADH2, CTA1, and SPS19 (15Simon M. Adam G. Rapatz W. Spevak W. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 18Gurvitz A. Wabnegger L. Rottensteiner H. Dawes I.W. Hartig A. Ruis H. Hamilton B. Mol. Cell. Biol.

Northern analysis was performed on immobilized RNA extracted from haploid 16×ADR1 cells containing multiple copies of the ADR1 gene (24Bemis L.T. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2125-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as well as from isogenic ADR1 cells containing a single wild-type ADR1 gene copy, adr1-1 cells with an adr1-1 mutation, or ADR1–5C cells expressing a partially constitutive ADR1 (23Denis C.L.

In bacteriophage T7-infected cells, the product of viral gene 2.5, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, performs this function.

Whereas gene 2.5 protein is functionally equivalent to Escherichia coli SSB protein and the bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein, it lacks significant sequence homology to these proteins, and neither of these proteins can replace its function in vivo (1Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10173-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, gene 2.5 protein binds ssDNA with a lower affinity than either the E. coli or T4 proteins (2Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

These interactions are mediated by a highly acidic carboxyl-terminal motif and are essential for coordination of leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis in vitro (12Lee J. Chastain 2nd, P.D.

In addition to binding ssDNA and physically interacting with T7 DNA polymerase, gene 2.5 protein also facilitates the annealing of complementary strands of DNA (10Kong D. Richardson C.C.

BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A number of proteins have evolved to carry out this vital function, such as the RecA protein (18Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A.

Koonin E.V. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unlike the RecA protein, the gene 2.5 protein does not require ATP (16Tabor, S., and Richardson, C. C. (July 9, 1996) U. S. Patent 5,534,407Google Scholar), and it cannot mediate strand transfer (11Kong D. Nossal N.G. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8380-8387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Tabor, S., and Richardson, C. C. (July 9, 1996) U. S. Patent 5,534,407Google Scholar). Gene 2.5 protein bears some similarity to the RecT protein and its family members, proteins that also mediate DNA annealing in an ATP-independent fashion (17Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Structurally, gene 2.5 protein differs from members of this family, which form multimeric ring structures in the presence and absence of ssDNA (24Kagawa W. Kurumizaka H. Ishitani R. Fukai S. Nureki O. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Singleton M.R. Wentzell L.M. Liu Y. West S.C. Wigley D.B. Proc.

Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its three-dimensional structure resembles that of other ssDNA-binding proteins (27Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similar to T4 gene 32 protein and E. coli SSB protein, gene 2.5 protein features an oligonucleotide/oligosaccaride binding fold (Fig. 1) (27Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although both T4 gene 32 protein and E. coli SSB protein have been shown to mediate DNA annealing (28Christiansen C. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Alberts B.M. Frey L. Nature. 1970; 227: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), T7 gene 2.5 protein does so much more efficiently (16Tabor, S., and Richardson, C. C. (July 9, 1996) U. S. Patent 5,534,407Google Scholar). The biochemical basis of the efficient DNA annealing activity of gene 2.5 protein is unknown. It seems likely that it involves interactions between two gene 2.5 protein-coated ssDNA molecules. A previous study has shown that the ability to bind ssDNA is critical for this reaction to occur (30Hyland E.M. Rezende L.F. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7247-7256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is also possible that interactions at the dimer interface are involved in this process. Two gene 2.5 proteins with alterations in the dimer interface retained the ability to mediate DNA annealing, in a manner similar to the WT protein, whereas a third did so in a slightly longer time period (31Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have recently employed a genetic screen to identify functional domains in gene 2.5 protein (31Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One of the alterations uncovered by the screen mapped to a loop connecting the prominent α-helix to the β-barrel portion of the structure (Fig. 1). The exact residue, Arg-82, resides in a disordered region of the structure. Here we describe the purification and characterization of this protein and show that it is defective in DNA annealing. Bacterial Strains and Phage—E. coli HMS262 (F– hsdR pro leu – lac – thi – supE tonA – trxA –) and E. coli HMS 89 (xth1 thi – argE mtl – xyl – str – R ara – his – galK lacY proA leu – thr – tsx – supE) were used as hosts for phage experiments. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (F– ompT hsdSB(rB-mB-) gal – dcm – (DE3)) (Novagen) was used to express gene 2.5.

The oligonucleotide BCMP206 (5′-TAACGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACG-3′) was synthesized by the Biopolymer Laboratory, Harvard Medical School. M13 (mGP1-2) DNA and T7 DNA polymerase lacking exonuclease activity (30Hyland E.M. Rezende L.F. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

E. coli SSB protein was purchased from U.S. Biochemical Corp. All other proteins were purified as described below. In Vivo DNA Synthesis Assay—Phage DNA synthesis was determined as described previously (31Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

E. coli HMS262 cells transformed with pETGP2.5-R82C were grown in Davis minimal media supplemented with ampicillin at 30 °C. Cells were infected with T7Δ2.5 phage at a multiplicity of infection of 7. At 5-min intervals postinfection, 200-μl samples were removed. [3H]thymidine (50μCi/ml) was added, and after a 90-s incubation at 30 °C, 40 μl of an ice-cold solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 2% SDS was added to the sample. The lysed cells were then spotted onto DE81 filters, washed, and air-dried. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA was then measured by liquid scintillation counting. Protein Purification—Gene 2.5 protein-R82C was overproduced and purified using a procedure previously employed to purify WT gene 2.5 protein (31Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A 1-liter culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) expressing gene 2.5 protein-R82C was grown, and gene 2.5 protein-R82C was purified by precipitation in polyethyleneimine (pH 7.5), followed by fractionation on an HQ column and a gel filtration column. The protein was 99% pure as determined by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining and was free of contaminating deoxyribonuclease activity (data not shown). Protein concentrations were calculated from UV spectrophotometer readings at 280 mm, using the calculated extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 2.59 × 104 M–1 cm–1 for gene 2.5 protein-R82C (32Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). His-tagged gene 2.5 protein-R82C was purified using a previously described method (31Rezende L.F. Hollis T.

Determining DNA Binding Affinity by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The ssDNA binding activity of gene 2.5 protein was assessed by a electrophoretic mobility shift assay (31Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Gene 2.5 proteins (diluted in a buffer of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) were incubated with 3 nm33P-end-labeled 70-mer oligonucleotide, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenyl blue. ssDNA was separated from ssDNA-protein complex on 10% TBE Ready Gels (Bio-Rad) running in 0.5× Tris/glycine buffer (12.5 mm Tris base, 95 mm glycine, 0.5 mm EDTA). Gels were dried and exposed to a Fujix phosphor imager plate, and the amount of radioactivity was calculated using ImageQuant software. DNA Annealing Assay—The ability of WT gene 2.5 protein to mediate the annealing of homologous strands of DNA was assessed using an in vitro annealing assay developed by Tabor and Richardson (16Tabor, S., and Richardson, C. C. (July 9, 1996) U. S. Patent 5,534,407Google Scholar). A 310-nucleotide internally labeled ssDNA fragment was generated as described previously (16Tabor, S., and Richardson, C. C. (July 9, 1996) U.

DNA annealing was assayed in reactions containing 4 nm32P-labeled ssDNA fragment, 20 μm M13 mGP1-2 ssDNA, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and various concentrations of gene 2.5 protein. Unless noted otherwise, reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 8 min. Time course experiments were carried out at 30 °C with 10 μm gene 2.5 protein, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 0.5%. Reaction products were analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel at 75 V for 1 h at room temperature, dried under vacuum, and exposed to a Fujix phosphor imager plate, and radioactivity was calculated using ImageQuant software. Plots of the data represent the background-corrected average of three experiments. Electron Microscopy—WT and altered gene 2.5 proteins or E. coli SSB protein were diluted to 500 ng/μl in 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, mixed with single-stranded WT M13 DNA at 25 ng/μl in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl final concentration. MgCl2 was added to the reaction buffer to 10 mm where indicated. Binding reactions with protein/DNA ratios (μg/μg) ranging from 40:1 for WT gene 2.5 protein to 10:1 for mutants and E. coli SSB protein were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in a 50-μl total reaction volume. Following the binding reactions, the samples were fixed with an equal volume of 1.2% glutaraldehyde for 5 min at room temperature and then loaded onto a 2-ml column of Bio-Gel A-5m previously equilibrated in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA. The same buffer was then used to elute the sample from the column and 250-μl fractions were collected. Aliquots of the protein-DNA containing fractions were mixed with a buffer containing spermidine (33Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) for 3 s and quickly applied to a mesh copper grid coated with a thin carbon film, glow-charged shortly before sample application. Following adsorption of the samples to the electron microscopy support for 1–2 min, the grids were subjected to a dehydration procedure in which the water content of the wash solutions was gently replaced by a serial increase in ethanol concentration to 100% and then air-dried. The samples were then rotary shadowcast with tungsten at 10–7 torr and examined in a Philips CM 12 TEM instrument at 40 kV. Micrographs, taken at × 46,000, were scanned using a Nikon LS-4500AF film scanner, and panels were arranged using Adobe Photoshop. Gel Filtration Analysis—Gel filtration analysis was performed as previously described (31Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fifty μg of gene 2.5 protein-R82C diluted in buffer S (final concentration 4 μm) were loaded on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). A standard curve of K av versus log M r was generated by applying low molecular weight protein standards (Amersham Biosciences) to the column under the same conditions. Analysis of Protein-Protein Interaction by Surface Plasmon Resonance—The interaction between gene 2.5 protein and T7 DNA polymerase was measured by SPR using the BIACORE 3000 system as described previously (31Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of 500 nm histidine-tagged gene 2.5 protein, gene 2.5 protein-R82C, and gene 2.5 protein-Δ26C were immobilized onto separate lanes of a nickel-charged sensor chip NTA (BIAcore). This amount of protein correlated to ∼7,000 resonance units. Ten μl of 500 nm T7 DNA polymerase or bovine serum albumin were passed over the chip, and dissociation of T7 DNA polymerase was monitored for 10 min while passing 100 μl of running buffer over the chip. Each analysis was performed in triplicate and repeated on three separate days. The kinetics of the gene 2.5 protein-T7 DNA polymerase interaction was assessed by binding 50 nm of either WT or mutant histidine-tagged gene 2.5 protein to the nickel-charged chip and then passing 10 μl of 0–50 nm T7 DNA over the chip. BIAevaluation software was used to determine dissociation constants (K D), which were solved using the simultaneous k a/k d data fit. Gene 2.5 Protein-R82C Cannot Support T7 DNA Synthesis or T7 Phage Growth—Gene 2.5 is essential for the growth of bacteriophage T7 (1Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10173-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this study, we examine a mutation, leading to a single amino acid change, arginine 82 to cysteine, that was isolated as part of a screen for lethal mutations in gene 2.5 (31Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As such, it was unable to support the growth of T7 phage lacking gene 2.5 (T7Δ2.5) (Table I). Interestingly, this mutation does not affect the function of WT gene 2.5 protein based on the fact that expression of the mutated gene from a plasmid does not inhibit the growth of WT T7 phage (Table I).Table IPlating efficiency of T7 and T7Δ2.5 on E. coli strains containing plasmids expressing WT or mutant T7 gene 2.5 proteinsPlasmidT7T7Δ2.5pETGP2.511pETGP2.5-R82C0.852.0 × 10-5 Open table in a new tab Since gene 2.5 is an essential gene and its product is involved in DNA synthesis in vitro, we examined the ability of gene 2.5 protein-R82C to carry out DNA synthesis in vivo. E. coli cells expressing the WT or mutant gene 2.5 protein were grown to midlog phase and then infected with a T7 phage lacking gene 2.5. At specific time points, aliquots of cells were removed and mixed with radioactively labeled thymidine. After 90 s, the reactions were terminated. Results of such an experiment are shown in Fig. 2. DNA synthesis peaks ∼30 min after infection in cells expressing WT gene 2.5. As a control, no DNA synthesis is observed in cells harboring gene 2.5 lacking the coding sequence for the carboxyl-terminal motif (gene 2.5 protein-Δ26C). Similarly, DNA synthesis declines soon after infection in cells expressing gene 2.5 protein-R82C. Therefore, it is likely that this mutant is lethal because it is defective in some aspect of DNA metabolism. Gene 2.5 Protein-R82C Binds ssDNA—One of the primary attributes of gene 2.5 protein is its ability to bind ssDNA (2Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we assessed the ability of the altered gene 2.5 proteins to bind ssDNA using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Using this method, we previously calculated the dissociation constant (K D) for WT gene 2.5 protein to be 2.6 × 10–6m (31Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the mobility of a 70-mer oligonucleotide is retarded as increasing amounts of gene 2.5 protein-R82C are added. Gene 2.5 protein-R82C binds ssDNA with ∼10-fold higher affinity than does the WT protein (K D = 3.0 × 10–7m). Thus, the amino acid alteration causes the protein to bind ssDNA with a higher affinity than WT gene 2.5 protein. Since gene 2.5 protein-R82C retains this vital function, we consider it unlikely that the alteration results in a mis-folded protein. Like other ssDNA binding proteins, WT gene 2.5 protein binds ssDNA with a much higher affinity than double-stranded DNA (2Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the binding of gene 2.5 protein-R82C to double-stranded DNA using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Gene 2.5 protein-R82C bound a double-stranded 70-base pair DNA weakly and in a manner similar to the WT protein (data not shown). Thus, whereas the alteration, arginine 82 to cysteine, conferred higher ssDNA-binding affinity upon gene 2.5 protein, it did not lead to increased double-stranded DNA binding activity. Gene 2.5 Protein-R82C Is Defective in DNA Annealing—Gene 2.5 protein can anneal homologous strands of ssDNA in vitro (16Tabor, S., and Richardson, C. C. (July 9, 1996) U. S. Patent 5,534,407Google Scholar, 30Hyland E.M. Rezende L.F. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7247-7256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 31Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this study, we looked at the ability of WT and altered gene 2.5 proteins to anneal a 310-nucleotide ssDNA fragment to single-stranded M13 DNA. As previously shown (16Tabor, S., and Richardson, C. C. (July 9, 1996) U. S. Patent 5,534,407Google Scholar), WT gene 2.5 protein can efficiently anneal these homologous strands of DNA (Fig. 4A). In this reaction, an internally labeled 310-nucleotide ssDNA is mixed with M13 circular ssDNA in the presence of varying concentrations of gene 2.5 protein. The labeled DNA fragment is homologous to a region of the M13 ssDNA. Annealing of the 310-nucleotide fragment to the homologous region of M13 ssDNA does not occur after an 8-min incubation at 30 °C in the absence of gene 2.5 protein (Fig. 4A, lane 1), since we observe a single, rapidly migrating radioactively labeled species on an agarose gel. When the concentration of gene 2.5 protein in the reaction is increased, annealing of the DNA strands begins to occur. In Fig. 4A, lane 4, we observe two species, the faster migrating corresponding to the unannealed 310-nucleotide fragment and a more slowly migrating species corresponding to the annealed product. The more slowly migrating species is present even after extraction with phenol chloroform (data not shown), suggesting that the gel shift is due to the increase in size of the annealed product and not a function of gene 2.5 protein binding to the ssDNA. At even higher concentrations (Fig. 4A), all of the labeled fragment is annealed to the M13 circular ssDNA. As previously shown (16Tabor, S., and Richardson, C. C. (July 9, 1996) U. S. Patent 5,534,407Google Scholar), DNA annealing is not observed under the same conditions when E. coli SSB protein is added to the reaction (Fig. 4B). Instead, a third species that migrates faster than the annealed product and slower than the fragment is observed upon the addition of E. coli SSB protein. Such a gel shift is noted in all protein concentrations tested (Fig. 4B, lanes 2–7). This species migrates more rapidly than the annealed product produced by gene 2.5 protein under the same conditions (Fig. 4B, lane 8). At pH 7.5, DNA annealing by E. coli SSB protein is dependent on the presence of a polyamine (28Christiansen C. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since we did not include polyamine in our assay, it is not surprising that E. coli SSB protein could not mediate this reaction under the conditions employed in this study. Gene 2.5 protein-R82C is defective in DNA annealing (Fig. 4C). At the highest concentration test (45 μm), only ∼25% of the fragment is converted to annealed product (Fig. 4C, lane 6). Under the same conditions, WT gene 2.5 protein anneals 100% of the fragment at a concentration of 15 μm (Fig. 4A, lane 5). Like E. coli SSB protein, gene 2.5 protein-R82C has a higher affinity for ssDNA than the WT protein. Thus, it is not surprising that we observe the appearance of a band that probably corresponds to a protein-DNA complex as the concentration of gene 2.5 protein-R82C in the reaction is increased (Fig. 4C, lanes 2–6). Next, we compared DNA annealing mediated by the WT protein with annealing mediated by gene 2.5 protein-R82C over a 4-min time period. In Fig. 5, we show that the WT protein anneals nearly all of the labeled fragment in the reaction in less than 3 min. In contrast, when the same concentration of gene 2.5 protein-R82C is added to the reaction, no annealed product is observed over the 4-min time course. Gene 2.5 protein-R82C and E. coli SSB protein both have a higher affinity for ssDNA than WT gene 2.5"

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the p38 MAP kinase pathway in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell transformation in JB6 cells. Our data show that a dominant negative mutant of p38 MAP (DN-p38) kinase inhibits EGF-promoted JB6 Cl41 cell transformation and that SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, also inhibits JB6 Cl41 cell transformation in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, our results show that DN-p38 MAP kinase inhibits the phosphorylation of EGF-stimulated activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Additionally, DN-p38 MAP kinase inhibits EGF-induced phosphorylation of c-Myc (Thr58/Ser62). Gel shift assays indicate that DN-p38 MAP kinase inhibits EGF-induced activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner.

On the other hand, ERKs are predominantly activated by mitogenic stimuli, including mitogens and growth factors, and activated ERKs are involved in cell differentiation and development (2Ballif B.A. Blenis J.

Previously, we studied ERKs regulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell transformation in promotion sensitive (P+) derivatives of the mouse epidermal JB6 cell line (8Huang C. Ma W.Y. Young M.R. Colburn N. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Results showed that inhibition of ERKs appeared to be an important contributor to the tumor promotion-resistant phenotype in JB6 cells. A recent study showed that the p38 kinase and JNKs pathways cooperate to transactivate the vitamin D receptor through the c-Jun/activator protein-1 (AP-1) (9Qi X. Pramanik R. Wang J. Schultz R.M.

This result indicates that a connection exists between p38 MAP kinase and AP-1. But AP-1 activation is involved in JB6 cell transformation promoted by EGF and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (10Liu G. Bibus D.M. Bode A.M. Ma W.Y. Holman R.T. Dong Z.

AP-1 is a dimeric complex consisting of proteins encoded by the jun and fos gene families, and the AP-1 binding region in these genes is referred to as the TPA response element (TRE). AP-1 induces the transcription of genes that are related to cell proliferation, metastasis, and metabolism (12Curran T. Franza Jr., B.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 395-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar, 13Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dawson M.I. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Increased AP-1 activity is associated with malignant transformation, and repression of AP-1 activity has been shown to lead to suppression of cell transformation and tumor promotion (15Dong Z. Huang C. Brown R.E. Ma W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9962-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Activation of MAP kinase cascades is known to play a considerable role in malignant transformation (3Papatsoris A.G. Papavassiliou A.G. Trends Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, whether p38 MAP kinase is involved in the regulation of cell transformation is not known. A recent study showed that only p38 MAP kinase, a MAP kinase usually associated with stress responses, growth arrest, and apoptosis, was consistently increased in human non-small cell lung cancer samples compared with the normal tissues examined (16Greenberg A.K. Basu S. Hu J. Yie T.A. Tchou-Wong K.M. Rom W.N. Lee T.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). More interesting are the results showing that ERKs and JNKs, the MAP kinase pathways traditionally associated with cell growth and perhaps malignant transformation, were not activated in the human non-small cell lung tumor samples. These results indicate that p38 MAP kinase is probably involved in malignant cell transformation. The purpose of this research project was to explore the mechanism of p38-mediated JB6 cell transformation using CMV-neo plasmid-transfected JB6 cells and dominant negative mutant p38 (DN-p38) plasmid-transfected JB6 cells following EGF stimulation. The results obtained show that p38 MAP kinase plays a critical role in regulation of JB6 Cl41 cell transformation promoted by EGF through the inhibition of the phosphorylation of ATF-2, STAT1, and c-Myc and the repression of AP-1 binding ability. Materials—Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM), l-glutamine, and LipofectAMINE™ 2000 reagent were from Invitrogen; EGF and SB202190 were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Gemini Bio-Product (Calabasas, CA). Penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamicin sulfate were from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Folin & Ciocalteu's phenol reagent was from Pierce, and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane was from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Antibodies to detect the phosphorylation of p38 kinase, ERKs, JNKs, ATF-2, STAT1, and c-Myc and the non-phosphorylated levels of p38 kinase, ERKs, JNKs, ATF-2, STAT1 and the c-Myc protein were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). [α-32P]ATP was from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture and Establishment of Stably Transfected JB6 Cells— Using the CMV-neo plasmid and DN-p38 kinase plasmid, we established stable transfectants according to the protocol from Invitrogen. All of these cells were selected in media containing 400 μg/ml of G-418 for 2 weeks, and then the G418 concentration was decreased to 200 μg/ml and maintained. Empty vector CMV-neo plasmid-transfected JB6 cells (Cl41 CMV-neo) and DN-p38 plasmid-transfected JB6 cells (Cl41 DN-p38) were cultured as adherent monolayers in MEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS and glutamine (2 mm) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Immunoblotting—Cl41 CMV-neo and Cl41 DN-p38 cells were cultured as described above, and immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (17Nomura M. Kaji A. He Z. Ma W.Y. Miyamoto K. Yang C.S. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46624-46631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were cultured to 80% confluence and then starved in 0.1% FBS/MEM for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The media were changed to fresh 0.1% FBS/MEM, the cells were incubated for another 2–4 h at 37 °C, and the cells were then treated with EGF for different time periods at the concentrations indicated. Cells were then disrupted with lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). The lysed samples were transferred into fresh 1.5-ml tubes and sonicated for 5–10 s. Samples containing an equal amount of protein were loaded into each lane of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis and subsequently transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Phosphorylation of ERKs, JNKs, ATF-2, STAT1, and c-Myc were selectively detected by Western immunoblotting using a chemiluminescent detection system and a phospho-specific antibody against phosphorylation of p38 kinase (Thr180/Tyr182), ERKs (Thr202/Tyr204), JNKs (Thr183/Tyr185), ATF-2 (Thr71), STAT1 (Ser727), and c-Myc (Thr58/Ser62). Antibodies against non-phosphorylated levels of p38 kinase, ERKs, JNKs, ATF-2, STAT1, and c-Myc were used as internal controls to determine loading efficiency. p38 MAP Kinase Activity Assay—A p38 MAP kinase activity assay was carried out following the instructions from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Cl41 CMV-neo cells and Cl41 DN-p38 cells were starved in 0.1% FBS/MEM at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h and then treated with EGF (10 ng/ml) for various times as indicated. Cells were harvested with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2), and protein concentration was determined by the Modified-Lowry protein assay. Total cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μlofan immobilized dual phospho-specific p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) monoclonal antibody. After extensive washing, the kinase reaction was performed at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of 100 μM ATP and 2 μg of an ATF-2 fusion protein. Phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr71 was measured by Western blot using a specific antibody against phosphorylation of ATF-2 (Thr71). AP-1 DNA Binding Study—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from cells by a modification of the method of Ye et al. (18Ye J. Zhang X. Dong Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, Cl41 CMV-neo cells and Cl41 DN-p38 cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes and starved in 0.1% FBS/MEM at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After 24 h of starvation, the cells were exposed to different concentrations of EGF for another 12 h. The cells were then harvested and disrupted in 500 μl of lysis buffer A (50 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a 1-min centrifugation (16,000 × g at 4 °C), the pellets containing the nuclei were washed once with 500 μl of Buffer B (Buffer A without Nonidet P-40). The pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer (Buffer B, but with 500 mm KCl and 10% glycerol) and strongly shaken at 4 °C for 30 min. After a 10-min centrifugation (16,000 × g at 4 °C), the supernatant solutions were moved into fresh tubes and stored at –70 °C until analysis. The DNA binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in a mixture containing 5 μg of nuclear protein, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 15,000 cpm of a α-32P-labeled double-stranded AP-1 oligonucleotide (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′). The samples were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, and the gels were analyzed using the Storm 840 phosphorimaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Anchorage-independent Transformation Assay—The role of p38 MAP kinase in EGF-promoted cell transformation was investigated in Cl41 CMV-neo cells and Cl41 DN-p38 cells. The effect of the inhibitor SB202190 on EGF-promoted cell transformation was explored in JB6 Cl41 cells. In brief, 8 × 103/ml cells were exposed to EGF (5–10 ng/ml) with or without SB202190 (0.1–0.5 μm) in 1 ml of 0.3% basal medium Eagle (BME) agar containing 10% FBS. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 10 days, and the cell colonies were scored as described by Colburn et al. (19Colburn N.H. Wendel E.J. Abruzzo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6912-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The effect of DN-p38 on JB6 Cl41 cell transformation is presented as colony number per 10,000 seeded Cl41 CMV-neo cells or Cl41 DN-p38 cells in soft agar, and the effect of SB202190 on JB6 cell transformation is also presented as the number of colonies per 10,000 cells. Amplification, Mutagenesis, and Expression Vector Construction of the STAT1—To further explore the role of transcriptional factor STAT1, one of the targets of p38 MAP kinase in JB6 Cl41 cell transformation, we gained stable expression of the point mutation at S727A (STAT1-S727A) and expression of only plasmid pcDNA 3.1. The JB6 Cl41 cell lines used included JB6 Cl41-STAT1-mt (S727A) and JB6 Cl41-pcDNA3.1 cells. All of these cells were employed to detect cell transformation ability promoted by EGF. In brief, the cDNA fragment of STAT1, including a 2253-base pair open reading frame (ORF), was reverse-transcribed with an oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), amplified by PCR with primers 5′-GCA GGA TCC TGT CTC AGT GGT ACG AAC T-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and 5′-TCG ACG CGT TGC TCT ATA CTG TGT TCA TC-3′ (MluI site underlined), and then cloned into the pACT vector (Promega, Madison, WI) via the BamHI and MluI restriction sites. The STAT1 coding fragment digested with BamHI/EcoRV from the pACT was cloned into the BamHI/SmaI sites of the pUC19 vector. To introduce the point mutation in the position of the Ser727 residue, a pair of sense and antisense primers for STAT1 S727A, 5′-C CTG CTC CCC ATG GCT CCT GAG GAG-3′ and 5′-CTC CTC AGG AGC CAT GGG GAG CAG G-3′ (underlined nucleotides indicate the codon coding a mutated amino acid) were synthesized (Sigma). Then, the nucleotide substitutions were accomplished using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To construct the mammalian expression vector, the PCR products of wild type STAT1 and STAT1-S727A were amplified using primers 5′-CGG GAT CCA TGT CTC AGT GGT ACG AAC TTC A-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and 5′-GGG ATA TCC TAT ACT GTG TTC ATC ATA CTG-3′ (EcoRV site underlined) and then introduced into same restriction sites of pcDNA3.1-neo (Invitrogen). All of products, including cloning, mutagenesis, or expression vectors, were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (Sigma). Statistical Analysis—Significant differences between groups were determined by the Student's and Welch's t tests. EGF Induces Phosphorylation of p38 Kinase and ERKs but Not JNKs—MAPKs play very important roles in the transformation of mouse JB6 Cl41 cells stimulated by EGF or TPA (8Huang C. Ma W.Y. Young M.R. Colburn N. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Our results showed that EGF induced phosphorylation of ERKs in both time- and dose-dependent manners (Fig. 1, A and G). We further investigated whether EGF also contributed to phosphorylation of other members of MAPKs such as p38 kinase and JNKs. Our results showed that EGF also induced phosphorylation of p38 kinase in both time- and dose-dependent manners (Fig. 1, C and I), but not JNKs (Fig. 1, E and K). These data correspond with other findings that show that EGF mediates cell growth through both MEK/ERK and p38 kinase signal transduction pathways (20Eguchi S. Dempsey P.J. Frank G.D. Motley E.D.

The p38 Kinase Inhibitor SB202190 Inhibits the EGF-induced Phosphorylation of p38 Kinase but Not ERKs—To explore the role of p38 kinase in the EGF-stimulated signal transduction pathway, SB202190, a p38 kinase inhibitor (22Nomura M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8810-8816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was used to pre-treat JB6 cells at different doses for 1 h. Our results showed that SB202190 inhibited the EGF-induced phosphorylation of p38 kinase in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B) but had no effect on EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that SB202190 can specifically inhibit EGF-induced p38 kinase phosphorylation. The p38 Kinase Inhibitor SB202190 Suppresses JB6 Cl41 Cell Anchorage-independent Transformation Promoted by EGF—To confirm the role of p38 MAP kinase in JB6 cell transformation, we explored EGF-promoted cell transformation in JB6 Cl41 cells using the p38 kinase inhibitor SB202190. JB6 cells were treated with EGF (10 ng/ml) alone or with SB202190 (0.1–0.5 μm) in a soft agar matrix at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 10 days. The colony number was determined as described previously, and experiments were repeated three times. Compared with JB6 Cl41 cells stimulated only by EGF, the colony numbers were greatly decreased after EGF and SB202190 treatment, and this inhibition occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A–E). These data provide more evidence that p38 MAP kinase contributes to JB6 cell transformation promoted by EGF, and this study is the first to report that SB202190 inhibits EGF-induced JB6 Cl41 cell transformation. DN-p38 MAP Kinase Inhibits Phosphorylation of p38 Kinase but Not ERKs or JNKs—Because SB202190 may affect other molecular targets besides p38 kinase, we used stable transfectants of Cl41 CMV-neo cells and Cl41 DN-p38 cells to further study the biological activity of p38 kinase (24Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25Liu G. Zhang Y. Bode A.M. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8810-8816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with EGF at various concentrations for different times, and Western blot analysis was used to determine the level of phosphorylation of p38 kinase, ERKs, and JNKs using specific antibodies. Our data showed that EGF induced phosphorylation of p38 kinase and ERKs in a dose- (Fig. 4, A and C) and time-dependent (Fig. 4, G and I) manner but had no effect on phosphorylation of JNKs (Fig. 4, E and K). Total protein levels of these kinases did not change (Fig. 4, B, D, F, H, J, and L). These data also showed that DN-p38 inhibited the EGF-induced phosphorylation of p38 kinase in a time- and dose-dependent manner but had no effect on phosphorylation of ERKs or JNKs. Results indicate that ERKs and p38 kinase, but not JNKs, are involved in EGF-stimulated cell signal transduction. DN-p38 Inhibits Anchorage-independent Transformation Promoted by EGF—From the results described above, we hypothesized that p38 kinase could have a role in regulating JB6 cell transformation. Cell transformation was assessed using our previously developed methods (26Bode A.M. Ma W.Y. Surh Y.J. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 850-853PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dong, Z., and Cmarik, J. L. (2002) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2002/130/pl7.Google Scholar). Cl41 CMV-neo cells and Cl41 DN-p38 cells were treated separately with EGF (5–10 ng/ml) in a soft agar matrix at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 10 days. The number of colonies formed was counted automatically by computer, and the same experiment was repeated three times. Our results showed that DN-p38 strongly inhibited the formation of EGF-induced colonies (Fig. 5D) compared with control cells (Fig. 5B). The inhibition was evident not only in colony number (Fig. 5E) but also in colony size (Fig. 5, B versus D). However, untreated Cl41 CMV-neo cells and Cl41 DN-p38 cells showed no colony formation (Fig. 5, A and C). These data indicate that p38 MAP kinase is involved in JB6 cell transformation as a positive regulator rather than an inhibitor. DN-p38 Inhibits EGF-induced p38 MAP Kinase Activity—To further confirm that the Cl41 DN-p38 stable transfectant cells work as expected, p38 MAPK activity toward its substrate, ATF-2, was assayed. Cells were treated with EGF (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times, and the cell extracts were incubated with an immobilized p38 kinase antibody. An ATF-2 fusion protein was used as a substrate of p38 MAP kinase, and phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr71 was detected by Western blot. Our results showed that EGF-induced phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr71 was decreased distinctly in Cl41 DN-p38 cells compared with Cl41 CMV-neo cells (Fig. 6). These data indicate that p38 kinase has a role in EGF-induced phosphorylation of ATF-2. DN-p38 Inhibits EGF-induced Phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser727 in a Time- and Dose-dependent Manner—STAT1 is downstream of p38 MAP kinase and is a transcription factor that mediates cytokine and growth factor-induced signals that culminate in various biological responses, including proliferation and differentiation (28Battle T.E. Frank D.A. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Cl41 DN-p38 cells and Cl41 CMV-neo cells were treated separately for various times and at various doses with EGF. We found that EGF (10 ng/ml) strongly induced phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser727 in Cl41 CMV-neo cells, but the phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser727 in Cl41 DN-p38 cells was relatively weak. However, phosphorylation of STAT1 gradually decreased within 120 min in both cell lines (Fig. 7A). Non-phosphorylated levels of STAT1 were unchanged throughout the time course and dose course (Fig. 7, B and D). EGF-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser727 gradually increased with increasing EGF concentrations (Fig. 7C) with no change in non-phosphorylated levels of STAT1 (Fig. 7D). DN-p38 Inhibits Phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr58/Ser62—To understand the mechanism of p38 MAP kinase in the regulation of JB6 cell transformation, we investigated the phosphorylation of c-Myc by Western blot using a specific antibody against phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr58/Ser62. The c-Myc oncoprotein is associated with cell growth, development, and malignant transformation in human tumors and cell lines (29Mukherjee B. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1480-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30al Moustafa A.E. Quatannens B. Dieterlen-Lievre F. Saule S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1667-1670PubMed Google Scholar). The active c-Myc also contributes to cell transforming potencies in rat embryo cells (31Barrett J. Birrer M.J. Kato G.J. Dosaka-Akita H. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3130-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this study, our results showed that phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr58/Ser62 was increased after CMV-neo JB6 cells were treated from 1–4 h with EGF (10 ng/ml), but phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr58/Ser62 in DN-p38-JB6 cells was relatively less within the same time course (Fig. 8A). EGF had no effect on total c-Myc protein levels in Cl41 CMV-neo cells or Cl41 DN-p38 cells (Fig. 8, B and D). Moreover, we studied the effects of various doses of EGF on phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr58/Ser62. Results showed that phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr58/Ser62 increased in Cl41 CMV-neo cells but was only slightly changed in Cl41 DN-p38 cells after cells were treated with EGF (5–20 ng/ml) (Fig. 8C). These data indicate that phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr58/Ser62 is induced by EGF in a time- and dose-dependent manner in Cl41 CMV-neo cells and that DN-p38 inhibits the phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr58/Ser62. A Mutant of STAT1 (S727A) Suppresses JB6 Cl41 Cell Anchorage-independent Transformation Promoted by EGF—Stable transfectant JB6 Cl41-STAT1 (S727A) cells expressing of STAT1 (S727A) and JB6 Cl41-pcDNA3.1 cells expressing plasmid pcDNA3.1 cells were employed to detect the cell transformation ability promoted by EGF. Cells were treated with EGF (10 ng/ml) in a soft agar matrix at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 10 days. The colony number was determined as described previously (8Huang C. Ma W.Y. Young M.R. Colburn N. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The colony numbers were greatly decreased in JB6 Cl41-STAT1 (S727A) cells promoted by EGF, but there were many more colonies in JB6 Cl41 cells and JB6 Cl41-pcDNA 3.1 stimulated by EGF under the same condition (Fig. 9, A–F). These data indicate that STAT1, one of the targets of p38 MAP kinase, also contributes to JB6 Cl41 cell transformation promoted by EGF. DN-p38 Inhibits EGF-induced AP-1 Binding Activity—AP-1 induces gene transcription by binding to the TPA response element site in the promoter region of its target gene and is required for cell proliferation, differentiation, and malignant transformation (32Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar, 33Eriksson M. Leppa S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15992-16001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Double-stranded AP-1 oligonucleotides were labeled with γ-32P, and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays were used to measured AP-1 DNA binding activity. Our results showed that AP-1 binding was decreased in Cl41 DN-p38 cells (Fig. 10, A and B , lanes 3, 4, and 5) compared with that in Cl41 CMV-neo cells (Fig. 10, A and B , lanes 7, 8, and 9) after cells were treated with EGF (5–20 ng/ml) for 12 h. However no significant change was observed between DN-p38-JB6 cells and Neo-JB6 cells without EGF stimulation (Fig. 10, A and B , lanes 2 and 6). To confirm that the electrophoretic mobility-shift band was specific for AP-1 binding, a 10-fold amount of unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide was added, and results showed that the AP-1 binding band was completely removed (Fig. 10, A and B , lane 1). These data indicate that DN-p38 inhibits EGF-induced AP-1 binding ability. Previous studies show that ERKs are involved in the JB6 cell transformation promoted by EGF or TPA (8Huang C. Ma W.Y. Young M.R. Colburn N. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), but an understanding of the role of p38 MAP kinase in cell transformation still remains unclear. In this study, we found that p38 MAP kinase plays a critical role in JB6 Cl41 cell transformation promoted by EGF. Both DN-p38 and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB202190 suppressed JB6 Cl41 cell transformation promoted by EGF. DN-p38 inhibited EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of ATF-2, STAT1, and c-Myc, and gel shift assay results showed that DN-p38 inhibits AP-1 binding ability. These results indicate that p38 MAP kinase is involved in regulation of JB6 Cl41 cell transformation promoted by EGF through the inhibition of phosphorylation of its downstream factors, including ATF-2, STAT1, c-Myc, and also AP-1 DNA binding. Many studies indicate that EGF induces the phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 MAP kinase (21Harris V.K. Coticchia C.M. Kagan B.L. Ahmad S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10802-10811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34Wisdom R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 35New L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19555-19564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ERK pathway is associated with activation of the EGF receptor and has been shown to play a major role in promoting several tumor phenotypes. However, the JNKs pathway has not been shown to be activated through the EGF receptor but is instead more uniformly stimulated by cellular stresses and cytokines (21Harris V.K. Coticchia C.M. Kagan B.L. Ahmad S. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10802-10811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our present data also show that EGF only induces the phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 MAP kinase but not JNKs (Fig. 1). SB202190 and DN-p38 only inhibit EGF-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase but not ERKs (Figs. 2 and 4). These results indicate that ERKs and p38 MAP kinase, but not JNKs, independently participate in EGF-stimulated cell signal transduction. The p38 MAP kinase is usually associated with stress responses, growth arrest, and apoptosis (1Harper S.J. LoGrasso P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 2Ballif B.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 397-408PubMed Google Scholar, 4Herlaar E. Brown Z. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 439-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). But a recent study (16Greenberg A.K. Basu S. Hu J. Yie T.A. Tchou-Wong K.M. Rom W.N. Lee T.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) showed that it was activated in human lung cancer samples, suggesting an additional role for this pathway in malignant cell growth or transformation. The present study is the first to report that p38 MAP kinase is involved in JB6 Cl41 cell transformation promoted by EGF. SB202190, a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, distinctly inhibited colony formation in EGF-promoted JB6 Cl41 cell transformation (Fig. 3). To eliminate the effects of SB202190 on other molecular targets, we successfully constructed a stable transfectant of JB6 Cl41 cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of p38 kinase and DN-p38 according to the method described previously (37Antonyak M.A. Kenyon L.C. Godwin A.K. James D.C. Emlet D.R. Okamoto I. Tnani M. Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5038-5046Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the number of colonies in EGF-treated Cl41 DN-p38 cells was significantly decreased compared with the number of colonies in Cl41 CMV-neo cells (Fig. 5). These data indicate that p38 MAP kinase plays a critical role in JB6 Cl41 cell transformation promoted by EGF. To explore the mechanism of p38 kinase in the regulation of JB6 cell transformation, we first determined whether p38 MAP kinase activity was inhibited in Cl41 DN-p38 cells. Our results show that DN-p38 distinctly inhibits EGF-induced phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr71 (Fig. 6). Thr71 is a major ATF-2 phosphorylation site required for transcriptional activity, and a high level of phosphorylated ATF-2 protein correlates with malignant phenotypes in the multistage mouse skin carcinogenesis model (39Zoumpourlis V. Papassava P. Linardopoulos S. Gillespie D. Balmain A. Pintzas A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4011-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One recent study showed that EGF activates transcription factor ATF-2 through a two-step mechanism. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway induces phosphorylation of ATF-2 (Thr71), whereas subsequent ATF-2 Thr69 phosphorylation requires the Ral-RalGDS-Src-p38 MAP kinase pathway (40Ouwens D.M. de Ruiter N.D. van der Zon G.C. Carter A.P. Schouten J. van der Burgt C. Kooistra K. Bos J.L. Maassen J.A. van Dam H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3782-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Moreover, cooperation between ERKs and p38 kinase was found to be essential for ATF-2 activation by EGF (41Calaf G. Hei T.K. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2001; 77: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Some of the STAT family members have a role in the regulation of cellular transformation (42Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that STAT3 activation is required for interleukin-6-induced transformation in tumor promotion-sensitive mouse skin epithelial cells (43Yu C.Y. Wang L. Khaletskiy A. Farrar W.L. Larner A. Colburn N.H. Li J.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3949-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Another report showed that transformation of normal fibroblasts cells with E1A + Ha-Ras oncogenes causes a constitutive activation of STAT1 and STAT3 transcription factors (44Poselova T.V. Evdonin A.L. Medvedeva N.D. Pospelov V.A. Tsitologiia. 1998; 40: 1074-1079PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we found that EGF-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 (Ser727) also decreased in Cl41 DN-p38 cells but increased in Cl41 CMV-neo cells after the cells were separately treated with EGF (10 ng/ml) (Fig. 7). We successfully employed directed point mutation technology to obtain a mutant of STAT1 at Ser727 (Ser → Ala). Stable transfectant of JB6 Cl41-STAT1 (S727A) cells expressing mutant of STAT1 at Ser727 (Ser727 (Ser → Ala) displayed its ability to inhibit cell transformation in JB6 Cl41 cells promoted by EGF (Fig. 9). These results indicate that EGF-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser727 is at least partially dependent on p38 MAP kinase and that STAT1 is involved in JB6 cell transformation promoted by EGF. Studies show that the c-Myc oncoprotein is associated with cancer cell proliferation and transformation (45Caruso J.A. Reiners Jr., J.J. Emond J. Shultz T. Tainsky M.A. Alaoui-Jamali M. Batist G. Mutat. Res. 2001; 473: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 46Yuen M.F. Wu P.C. Lai V.C. Lau J.Y. Lai C.L. Cancer. 2001; 91: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this study, we also found that DN-p38 inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of c-Myc, indicating that p38 MAP kinase mediates EGF-induced c-Myc phosphorylation (Fig. 8). Thus, p38 MAP kinase may be involved in cell transformation through phosphorylation of c-Myc. On the other hand, AP-1, a heterodimer commonly comprised of the basic leucine zipper proteins Fos and Jun, plays a very important role in the induction of neoplastic transformation and the multiple genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation (47Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 48Sanyal S. Sandstrom D.J. Hoeffer C.A. Ramaswami M. Nature. 2002; 416: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Blocking the tumor promoter-induced activation of AP-1 was shown to inhibit neoplastic transformation in JB6 mouse epidermal cells (49Dong Z. Birrer M.J. Watts R.G. Matrisian L.M. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). One recent study (47Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) showed that p38 MAPK and ERK inhibition with SB203580 and PD98059, respectively, significantly inhibited silica-induced AP-1 activation. These findings demonstrate that AP-1 activation may be mediated through the p38 MAPK and ERKs pathways (47Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present research, EGF-induced AP-1 binding ability decreased in Cl41 DN-p38 cells compared with Cl41 CMV-neo cells (Fig. 10). These data provide further evidence that EGF-induced AP-1 binding ability is mediated through p38 MAP kinase and that DN-p38 MAP kinase represses EGF-induced JB6 Cl41 cell transformation through inhibition of AP-1 DNA binding ability. In summary, we report for the first time that p38 MAP kinase mediates EGF-promoted JB6 Cl41 cell transformation through regulation of the phosphorylation of its downstream factors, such as STAT1, ATF-2, and c-Myc, and also AP-1 DNA binding ability (Fig. 11). This study illustrates that p38 MAP kinase is another new pathway involved in JB6 Cl41 cell transformation promoted by EGF."
https://openalex.org/W2171672078,"F-like plasmid transfer is mediated by the FinOP fertility inhibition system. Expression of the F positive regulatory protein, TraJ, is controlled by the action of the antisense RNA, FinP, and the RNA-binding protein FinO. FinO binds to and protects FinP from degradation and promotes duplex formation between FinP and traJ mRNA, leading to repression of both traJ expression and conjugative F transfer. FinP antisense RNA secondary structure is composed of two stem-loops separated by a 4-base single-stranded spacer and flanked on each side by single-stranded tails. Here we show that disruption of the expected Watson-Crick base pairing between the loops of FinP stem-loop I and its cognate RNA binding partner, traJ mRNA stem-loop Ic, led to a moderate reduction in the rate of duplex formation in vitro. In vivo, alterations of the anti-ribosome binding site region in the loop of FinP stem-loop I reduced the ability of the mutant FinP to mediate fertility inhibition and to inhibit TraJ expression when expressed in trans at an elevated copy number. Alterations of intermolecular complementarity between the stems of these RNAs reduced the rate of duplex formation. Our results suggest that successful interaction between stem-loop I of FinP and stem-loop Ic of traJ mRNA requires that base pairing must proceed from an initial loop-loop interaction through the top portion of the stems for stable duplex formation to occur.

RNA/RNA interactions are important in a wide variety of biological systems (reviewed in Refs. 1Brantl S. Biochim. Biophys.

Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the genes required for conjugative F plasmid transfer are encoded in the 33.3-kb transfer (tra) operon, and expression of the operon is driven from the major tra operon promoter, PY (reviewed in Ref. 8Frost L.S. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Efficient transcription from PY requires the activity of the positive regulatory protein, TraJ (9Willetts N. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). TraJ expression is in turn regulated by the activity of the antisense RNA, FinP (GenBank™ accession number U01159), and the RNA-binding protein, FinO (Protein Data Bank accession number 1DVO). FinP antisense RNA is composed of 79 bases arranged into two stem-loops (SL) 1The abbreviations used are: SL, stem-loops; UTR, untranslated region; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RBS, ribosome binding site. separated by a 4-base single-stranded spacer and flanked by 4-base and 6-base single-stranded tails on the 5′ and 3′ sides, respectively (Fig. 1) (10van Biesen T. Soderbom F. Wagner E.G. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). FinP is complementary to a portion of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of traJ mRNA, which contains SL-Ic and SL-IIc, complementary to FinP SL-I and SL-II, respectively (Fig. 1) (11Mullineaux P. Willetts N. Basic Life Sci. 1985; 30: 605-614PubMed Google Scholar, 12Finlay B.B. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Willetts N.S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 754-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dempsey W.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 209: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The traJ ribosome binding site (RBS) is located in the top portion of SL-Ic (Fig. 1), and binding of FinP to the 5′-UTR of traJ mRNA is believed to sequester the RBS within a FinP/traJ mRNA duplex, via base pairing with a region in the loop of FinP SL-I termed the anti-RBS. This interaction is thought to prevent TraJ translation, thus repressing expression of the F plasmid transfer operon (11Mullineaux P. Willetts N. Basic Life Sci. 1985; 30: 605-614PubMed Google Scholar, 14Koraimann G. Koraimann C. Koronakis V. Schlager S. Hogenauer G. Mol.

Microbiol. 1996; 21: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In F-like plasmids, the regulatory activity of FinP depends upon the action of the plasmid-encoded protein, FinO (16Finnegan D.J. Willetts N.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1971; 111: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and in F, whose finO gene is interrupted by an IS3 insertion element, transfer is completely derepressed (17Yoshioka Y. Ohtsubo H. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 619-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FinO is not plasmid-specific, and when supplied in trans, FinO from the related plasmid R6–5 (18van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or R100 (19Finnegan D. Willetts N. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 127: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) can repress F transfer. FinO is a 186-amino acid, 21.2-kDa basic cytoplasmic protein with a highly α-helical structure that adopts a novel protein fold (20Ghetu A.F. Gubbins M.J. Frost L.S. Glover J.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). FinO binds the relatively unstable FinP molecule (20Ghetu A.F. Gubbins M.J. Frost L.S. Glover J.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Jerome L.J. Frost L.S. J. Biol.

Frost L.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Jerome L.J. van Biesen T. Frost L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1457-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and allowing the steady-state concentration of FinP to increase to sufficient levels to mediate repression of traJ expression (25Lee S.H. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Frost L. Lee S. Yanchar N. Paranchych W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, the requirement of FinO for inhibition of transfer and traJ expression can be alleviated by providing FinP at elevated copy number in the cell (14Koraimann G. Koraimann C. Koronakis V. Schlager S. Hogenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Koraimann G. Teferle K. Markolin G. Woger W. Hogenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). FinO also catalyzes FinP/traJ mRNA duplex formation in vitro (10van Biesen T. Soderbom F. Wagner E.G. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Ghetu A.F. Gubbins M.J. Frost L.S. Glover J.N. Nat. Struct.

Genet. 1998; 259: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which is believed to allow rapid sequestration of the traJ RBS and efficient inhibition of traJ expression in vivo (14Koraimann G. Koraimann C. Koronakis V. Schlager S. Hogenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Koraimann G. Teferle K. Markolin G. Woger W. Hogenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). “Kissing” between loops of RNA stem-loop structures is commonly the first interaction to occur during the process of RNA/RNA duplex formation (reviewed in Refs. 27Wagner E.G. Simons R.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 713-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar and 28Wagner E.G.H. Brantl S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). F-like conjugative plasmids encode eight different alleles of FinP, with the highest variability in the loops (8Frost L.S. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Finlay B.B. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Willetts N.S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 754-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jerome L.J. Frost L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10356-10362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The loop sequences of FinP and traJ mRNA are therefore thought to be responsible for mediating the plasmid specificity of the F-like FinOP systems (12Finlay B.B. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Willetts N.S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 754-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Koraimann G. Koraimann C. Koronakis V. Schlager S. Hogenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Koraimann G. Teferle K. Markolin G. Woger W. Hogenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and are thought to be the initial site of interaction between the sense and antisense RNAs. Although the loop sequences of FinP in F-like plasmids vary, a common motif, 5′-YUNR-3′ (where Y represents pyrimidine, N is any base, and R is purine), is found in several finP alleles (8Frost L.S. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is a key structural motif in the loops of many antisense RNA molecules (29Franch T. Petersen M. Wagner E.G. Jacobsen J.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The structural features of SL-I and SL-Ic of FinP antisense RNA and traJ mRNA, respectively, that influence FinO-mediated duplex formation in vitro were characterized. Duplex analyses employing EMSAs using in vitro synthesized RNAs and purified FinO protein were used to measure apparent second-order association rate constants (k app) of duplex formation for a variety of interacting RNA partners. Our studies demonstrate that both in vitro and in vivo, FinO can overcome a variety of sequence and structural changes to FinP SL-I and traJ mRNA SL-Ic in order to promote duplex formation. Preparation of in Vitro Transcription Templates—All RNAs employed in this work are derived from F-encoded FinP and traJ mRNA. All solutions used for RNA work were treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate prior to use. Transcription of FinP SL-I, traJ SL-Ic, and their mutant derivatives employed the T7 RNA polymerase promoter top strand oligonucleotide primer MGU5 and various oligonucleotide primer templates (Table I). Oligonucleotide template primers (Molecular Biology Services Unit, University of Alberta) were electrophoresed on a 10% (29:1), 8 m urea polyacrylamide gel at a constant 300 V for ∼2 h. Full-length oligonucleotides were excised from the polyacrylamide gels after ethidium bromide staining. The gel slices were crushed and eluted overnight at 37 °C in elution buffer (0.5 m NH4OAc, 0.1 mm EDTA). The supernatants were removed and extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (1:1), followed by an extraction with chloroform. The DNA was then ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in 30–50 μl of Milli-Q water, and the concentration of the purified DNA was determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm in a Bio-Rad Smart-Spec 3000. Seventy-five pmol of the template strand were mixed with a 1.5-fold molar excess of the complementary T7 RNA polymerase promoter top strand oligonucleotide primer, MGU5, in a total volume of 50 μl. MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 100 mm, and the mixture was heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Cooling to room temperature over 1 h and 45 min allowed annealing of the template oligonucleotide to the MGU5 T7 RNA polymerase primer.Table IPrimers used in this studyPrimerPrimer sequence (5′ → 3′)FunctionLFR21GAGGTTCCTATGTATFinP-specific probeMGU53CCATCGGATACATAGGAACCTGGACACAAAGGATTCTATGGACAGMutagenic primer for creating pUC180GGAMGU54CTGTCCATAGAATCCTTTGTGTCCAGGTTCCTATGTATCCGATGGMutagenic primer for creating pUC180GGAMGU5TAATACGACTCACTATAGTop strand of the consensus T7 RNA Polymerase promoter sequenceMGU12TGTCCATAGAATCCTTTGTGAGGAGGTTCCTATGTATCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTATranscription template for wild-type SL-IMGU13TGTCGTATCCTTGGACCTCACAATCCTAAGATACTATCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTATranscription template for SL-IcRMGU14GATACATAGGAACCTCCTCACAAAGGATTCTATGGACACTATAGTGAGTCGTATTATranscription template for wild-type SL-IcMGU17TGTCCATAGAAACCTTTGTGAGGAGGTTCCTATGTATCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTATranscription template for SL-I(A27U)MGU18GATACATAGGAACCTCCTCACAAAGGTTTCTATGGACACTATAGTGAGTCGTATTATranscription template for SL-Ic(U85A)MGU45CATAGGTTGGACCTCACAATCCTATCTATGCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTATranscription template for SL-Ic(TSR)MGU46GTATCCAACCTCCTCACAAAGGATAGATAC CTATAGTGAGTCGTATTATranscription template for SL-Ic(BSR)MGU41TGTCCATAGAATCCTTTGTGTCCAGGTTCCTATGTATCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTATranscription template for SL-I(16-18)MGU28TGTCCATAGAATCCTTTCACTGGAGGTTCCTATGTATCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTATranscription template for SL-I(18-21)MGU44TGTCCATAGAATCCTAACTGAGGAGGTTCCTATGTATCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTATranscription template for SL-I(21-23)MGU24CATAGGAACCTCCTCACAAAGGATTCTATGCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTATranscription template for SL-Ic(Δtails)MGU23CATAGAATCCTTTGTGAGGAGGTTCCTATGCTATAGGTAGTCGTATTATranscription template for SL-I(Δtails) Open table in a new tab In Vitro Transcriptions—Annealed templates prepared as described above were added to a final concentration of 300 nm in 20-μl transcription reactions. For labeled reactions, GTP/ATP/CTP were added to a final concentration for each of 2.5 mm, and UTP was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, along with 10–50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Twenty-six units of RNA Guard (Amersham Biosciences) were added to each reaction, along with 1× transcription buffer (Roche Applied Science) supplemented with 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (RNase Free; Roche Applied Science). Twenty units of T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) were added, and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Ten units of DNase I (RNase Free; Roche Applied Sciences) were added, and the reactions were incubated for a further 15 min to digest the template DNA. One-fifth volume of RNA load dye (96% (v/v) deionized formamide, 0.05% (w/v) each xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue, 20 mm EDTA) was added, and the RNA was heated to 95 °C for approximately 5 min and then cooled on ice. The RNA was electrophoresed on an 8% (29:1), 8 m urea polyacrylamide gel at 250 V for ∼2 h. The radioactive RNA band was visualized by exposure to Kodak X-Omat R film for several minutes and then excised and purified as described above, except the purified RNA was dissolved in 10 μl of Milli-Q water after precipitation. To make unlabeled RNA, all procedures were the same, except GTP/ATP/CTP/UTP were added to transcription reactions at a final concentration of 2.5 mm. The unlabeled RNA was visualized by staining in ethidium bromide and gel-purified as described above. EMSAs for Apparent Second Order Association Rate Constant Determination—EMSA analyses for determination of k app values were performed essentially as described (20Ghetu A.F. Gubbins M.J. Frost L.S. Glover J.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Sandercock J.R. Frost L.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60 fmol of 32P-labeled RNA was incubated with 600 fmol of its unlabeled complementary RNA in a 50-μl reaction containing 1× TMN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm NaCl). Plasmid R6–5 FinO, purified as described (22Ghetu A.F. Gubbins M.J. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Frost L.S. Glover J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14036-14044Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was added to a final concentration of 6 μm to the reactions where appropriate. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and 5-μl aliquots were withdrawn at various times, mixed with 10 μl of ice-cold TMN stop solution (1× TMN containing 30% (v/v) glycerol and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue), and kept on ice. The samples were then electrophoresed on 8% (29:1) nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing Tris/glycine buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0–8.3, 190 mm glycine) at a constant 160 V for 65 min at room temperature. Gels were dried and then exposed on Molecular Dynamics Storage Phosphor screens overnight. Free and duplexed RNA species were visualized and quantified using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager 445 SI and ImageQuaNT software. k 1 values were derived from log plots of the percentage of free labeled RNA versus time of incubation to determine the time required for 50% of the free labeled RNA to form a duplex. k app values were then calculated from k 1 and the concentration of the RNA species in excess, essentially as described (23Sandercock J.R. Frost L.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Persson C. Wagner E.G. Nordstrom K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3279-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). EMSA for Detection of FinO Binding to SL-I and SL-I(Δtails)—The association equilibrium constant (K a) for FinO binding to 32P-labeled FinP SL-I or derivatives thereof was performed as described (22Ghetu A.F. Gubbins M.J. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Frost L.S. Glover J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14036-14044Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except 6 fmol of 32P-labeled RNA were used per reaction instead of 7.5 fmol. Quantification of unbound and FinO-bound RNAs and calculation of the association constants were performed exactly as described (22Ghetu A.F. Gubbins M.J. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Frost L.S. Glover J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14036-14044Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Sandercock J.R. Frost L.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Construction of Recombinant Plasmids—The plasmids used in this study and the relevant details and sources of each are listed in Table II. Isolation of all plasmid DNA was performed using a rapid alkaline extraction technique (31Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar). All clones constructed during the course of this work were sequenced using the DYEnamic ET fluorescent sequencing system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) to confirm that the correct DNA sequence was present in each clone. All restriction enzymes used for DNA cloning were purchased from Roche Applied Science. The plasmid pUC180GGA was constructed to express FinP(C16G/C17G/U18A) from its own promoter from the high copy number vector pUC18. The plasmid pUC180 contains a 180-base EcoRI/HindIII fragment derived from F, which encodes wild-type FinP, expressed from its own promoter in the absence of transcription from PtraJ (24Jerome L.J. van Biesen T. Frost L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1457-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This plasmid served as a template for site-directed mutagenesis of FinP using the mutagenic primers MGU53 and MGU54 (Table I) and Pfu Turbo® (Stratagene) to create pUC180GGA. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene), except the plasmid was transformed into rubidium chloride-competent E. coli to propagate the DNA (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing as described above. pLT180GGA was created by inserting the 180-base EcoRI/HindIII fragment containing FinP(C16G/C17G/U18A) from pUC180GGA into similarly digested pT7-3 (33Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To provide FinO in trans, the plasmid pSnO104 (Table II) was transformed into the test strains where appropriate. Donor cultures were grown with appropriate antibiotic selection at 37 °C with agitation to midlog phase (A 600 ∼0.6–1.0), and 0.5 A 600 equivalents were pelleted and washed with fresh LB broth (Difco) to remove antibiotics and then resuspended in 500 μl of fresh LB broth.

Cultures were vortexed vigorously for 15 s and placed on ice to disrupt mating pairs. 10-fold serial dilutions were made using ice-cold 1× PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mm KH2PO4), and 10 μl of each dilution were inoculated on agar plates to select for donor and transconjugant cells. Donors containing pSLF20 alone were selected on Maconkey-Lactose plates (Difco) containing 200 μg/ml streptomycin. Donors containing pSLF20 and any one of the plasmids pT7-3, pLT180, or pLT180GGA were selected on Maconkey-Lactose plates containing 200 μg/ml streptomycin and 5.0 μg/ml ampicillin. All donor constructs containing pSnO104 were selected on Maconkey-Lactose plates to which chloramphenicol was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, in addition to the other antibiotics listed above. All transconjugants were selected on L1-spectinomycin plates (25Lee S.H. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml spectinomycin. All plates were incubated at 37 °C for 12–36 h until visible colonies appeared. Donor and transconjugant cells were then counted, and the ratio of transconjugants to donors was calculated, allowing mating efficiency to be compared with the control of conjugative transfer of pSLF20 alone, which was set at 100% mating efficiency. Immunoblot Analysis—Cell pellets corresponding to 0.1 A 600 equivalents were boiled in SDS sample buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar) for 5 min, and the supernatants were electrophoresed on 15% (29:1) SDS-polyacrylamide gels using the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean® system. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.) at 100 V for1hat4 °C using Towbin buffer (35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 10% (w/v) skim milk (Difco) dissolved in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (Caledon Laboratories)). Primary antibodies diluted in 10% skim milk in TBST were added to blots and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The following dilutions of polyclonal antisera (raised in rabbits) were used: anti-FinO, 1:50,000; anti-TraJ, 1:15,000. Blots were washed at room temperature four times for 15 min each with TBST. The secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) at a 1:10,000 dilution. Blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody and then washed as described above. Blots were developed with Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat R film for varying times to visualize the signals. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated via a modified hot phenol method as described (23Sandercock J.R. Frost L.S. Mol. Gen.

RNA (30 μg) was denatured for 5 min at 95 °C in formamide RNA load dye and then electrophoresed on an 8% (29:1), 8 m urea polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Zeta-Probe nylon membranes (Bio-Rad) as described (24Jerome L.J. van Biesen T. Frost L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1457-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The blots were prehybridized for 4 h using the same conditions as described (24Jerome L.J. van Biesen T. Frost L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1457-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), except 200 μg/ml each of boiled E. coli strain W tRNA type XX and sonicated calf thymus DNA (Sigma) were added to the hybridization solution. The FinP-specific probe primer A (Table I) was 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and ∼10 pmol of the probe was added to the blots in fresh hybridization solution. Incubation proceeded overnight at 37 °C, and the blots were then washed as described (23Sandercock J.R. Frost L.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and exposed on an Amersham Biosciences storage phosphor screen. Bands corresponding to FinP were visualized using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager 445 SI and ImageQuaNT software. RNA Secondary Structure Predictions—Secondary structure predictions and ΔG values of SL-I, SL-Ic, and their derivatives were performed using the Mfold version 3.1 algorithm (36Zuker M.

Their processing depends on helicases that catalyze junction branch migration, and endonucleases that resolve the junction into nicked linear DNAs. Here we have investigated the role of a DNA binding motif called SAP in binding and resolving Holliday junctions by the fission yeast mitochondrial resolvase SpCCE1. Mutation or partial/complete deletion of the SAP motif dramatically impairs the ability of SpCCE1 to resolve Holliday junctions in a heterologous in vivo system. These mutant proteins retain the ability to recognize the junction structure and to distort it upon binding. However, once formed the mutant protein-junction complexes are relatively unstable and dissociate much faster than wild-type complexes. We show that binding stability is necessary for efficient junction resolution, and that this may be due in part to a requirement for maintaining the junction in an open conformation so that it can branch migrate to cleavable sites.

Homologous recombination plays a prime role in DNA metabolism. It repairs double-strand breaks and stalled/collapsed replication forks, guides chromosome segregation at meiosis, and generates genetic diversity. A key intermediate of homologous recombination is the four-way DNA (Holliday) junction, which forms as a consequence of strand exchange catalyzed by the RecA/Rad51 family of proteins (1Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Holliday junctions also form by regression of stalled replication forks (2Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 3Postow L. Ullsperger C. Keller R.W. Bustamante C. Vologodskii A.V. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 8211-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Once formed, the Holliday junction is subject to branch migration through regions of homology and/or cleavage. Such processing is pivotal both for determining the outcome of the recombination reaction and for enabling replication to restart at stalled forks. Holliday junctions are cleaved by a ubiquitous but diverse group of metal ion-dependent endonucleases called the Holliday junction resolvases (for reviews, see Refs. 6Lilley D.M. White M.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and 7Sharples G.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Resolvases are typically small dimeric enzymes with a preponderance of positively charged residues. At least for some resolvases these charges form a largely basic electrostatic surface, which presumably enables interaction with the overall shape of the DNA junction. Enzymatically the resolvases are characterized by their ability to: 1) bind Holliday junctions in a structure-specific manner; 2) introduce a pair of symmetrically related nicks in strands of like polarity at or close to the junction crossover point; and 3) generate nicks with 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini that are readily ligated. In most cases junction binding is associated with a distortion of the stacked-X conformation of the Holliday junction to a more open structure (8White M.F. Lilley D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9White M.F. Lilley D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5609-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Duckett D.R. Panis M.J.

This is thought to aid the positioning of the scissile bonds close to the catalytic sites of the enzyme. A subset of resolvases, including Escherichia coli RuvC, which are most selective for cleaving Holliday junctions, only cut at specific nucleotide sequences. In the case of RuvC this sequence is 5′-(A/T)TT↓(G/C) (14Fogg J.M. Schofield M.J. White M.F. Lilley D.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11349-11358Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Shah R. Bennett R.J. West S.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Sequence specificity is proposed to aid structure selectivity because, unlike many other branched DNA molecules, Holliday junctions can be moved to different nucleotide sequences by branch migration. In accord with a need for relocating junctions to cleavable sequences, RuvC functions together with RuvAB that catalyzes the ATP-dependent branch migration of Holliday junctions (16van Gool A.J. Shah R. Mezard C. West S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1838-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Whitby M.C. Bolt E.L. Chan S.N. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 878-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae cruciform-cutting endonuclease 1 (CCE1) and its homologue from Schizosaccharomyces pombe SpCCE1 (also called Ydc2) are mitochondrial-specific Holliday junction resolvases (18Kleff S. Kemper B. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 19Lockshon D. Zweifel S.G. Freeman-Cook L.L. Lorimer H.E. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L.

Genet. 2000; 263: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Despite displaying little sequence identity, CCE1 and SpCCE1 are structurally related to RuvC (23Aravind L. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3417-3432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ceschini S. Keeley A. McAlister M.S. Oram M. Phelan J. Pearl L.H. Tsaneva I.R. Barrett T.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6601-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Like RuvC they unfold the Holliday junction into a similar square-planar extended structure and cleave it with clear sequence specificity (after 5′-CT and/or 5′-TT in the case of SpCCE1) (8White M.F. Lilley D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9White M.F. Lilley D.M.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7733-7740Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, unlike RuvC, these enzymes appear to function efficiently in vivo without the need for a specific branch migration enzyme. In this paper we have investigated the role of a putative DNA binding domain in SpCCE1 that resembles the SAP motif (named after SAF-A/B, Acinus and PIAS) (27Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The SAP motif is a helix-extended region helix domain that contains a number of conserved hydrophobic and charged amino acids as well as one or two conserved glycines in the extended loop region, and is typically located at the N or C terminus of a protein. SAP motifs are found in a number of chromatin-associated proteins, such as the scaffold attachment factors SAF-A and SAF-B, PIAS family members, Acinus, and the proto-oncogene protein DEK (27Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Typically these proteins function as transcription factors and/or are involved in RNA metabolism. The SAP motif is also found in several DNA repair proteins, including the non-homologous end-joining protein Ku70, some plant homologues of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, the AP endonuclease Arp, and the post-replicational repair protein Rad18 (27Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Direct evidence that the SAP motif is important for DNA binding has been obtained for SAF-A and Ku70. In both cases DNA binding, which is dependent on SAP, could be detected by Southwestern blotting and pull-down assays using protein coupled to Sepharose (28Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Kipp M. Gohring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M. Fackelmayer F.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 31Gohring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The SAP motif of SAF-A binds specifically to DNA elements called scaffold/matrix attachment regions, which are chromatin regions that bind to the nuclear matrix (30Kipp M. Gohring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M. Fackelmayer F.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). On the basis of this it has been suggested that the SAP motif may generally target proteins involved in transcription, pre-mRNA processing, and DNA repair to specific regions of the chromatin (27Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 30Kipp M. Gohring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M. Fackelmayer F.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Here we show that the SAP motif is critical for the ability of SpCCE1 to resolve Holliday junctions in a heterologous in vivo system. The dependence of SpCCE1 on SAP is not for targeting it to scaffold/matrix attachment regions or Holliday junctions, or even resolving junctions per se. Instead the SAP motif is required for stabilizing the interaction of SpCCE1 with a Holliday junction. We provide indirect evidence that stable junction binding is necessary to promote branch migration to cleavable sites. As such SpCCE1 may be the first example of a Holliday junction resolvase that couples branch migration and cleavage activities in a single polypeptide. Strains, Plasmids, and General Methods—The E. coli strains AM888 (ΔruvAC65 ΔrusA::kan) and BL21(DE3) plysS have been described, as has the plasmid vector pT7-7 and its Spcce1 + derivative pMW206, and pMW207, which is a derivative of pET-14b (Novagen) that expresses SpCCE1 with an N-terminal His tag from a T7 phage φ10 promoter (20Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 45Mahdi A.A. Sharples G.J. Mandal T.N. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol.

Strains were grown in LB medium with antibiotic selection as required. Measurement of UV sensitivity was as described (20Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Construction of SpCCE1 SAP Motif Mutants—The N-terminal deletion mutants were constructed by PCR using primers that amplified truncated versions of Spcce1 missing the first 5 (Δ5), 15 (Δ15), and 32 (Δ32) codons. In each case an ATG start codon was incorporated to allow expression of the truncated protein, along with NdeI and BamHI sites to facilitate cloning into pT7-7 and pET-14b as described previously for pMW206 and pMW207. Single and double amino acid substitutions in SpCCE1 were made by introducing appropriate codon changes in the Spcce1 gene in pMW207 using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The L9P/K14A mutant was constructed by introducing the L9P mutation into the K14A mutant plasmid in a second round of mutagenesis. The codon changes for each mutant are: GTC12 → CCG (V4P); TTA27 → CCA (L9P); AAG42 → GCG (K14A); TTG54 → GGT (L18G); GGA66 → TCA (G22S); GGA66 → GAC (G22D); AGA69 → GGA (R23G); AAG72 → GGG (K24G); and TTG81 → CCG (L27P). Mutations were verified by sequencing the Spcce1 gene in each of the plasmids generated. Derivatives of pT7-7 containing the mutant Spcce1 genes were made by subcloning from the mutagenized pMW207 plasmids. Proteins—His-tagged wild-type and mutant SpCCE1 proteins were expressed from the appropriate pET-14b-derived Spcce1 plasmid in BL21 (DE3) plysS. Cells were grown as 1-liter cultures at 18 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol. At a cell density corresponding to an A 600 of 0.5, SpCCE1 was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm. Incubation was then continued for a further 5 h, after which the cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 ml of buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) and frozen at–80 °C until required. Frozen cells were thawed on ice, mixed with β-mercaptoethanol (to 7 mm), Triton X-100 (to 1%), and protease inhibitors, before lysis by passage through a French pressure cell at 15,000 p.s.i. After centrifugation at 43,700 × g for 1 h the cleared lysate was loaded directly onto a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen), which was washed with 30 ml of buffer H (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 50 mm imidazole before eluting bound protein with 4 ml of buffer H containing 200 mm imidazole. The nickel eluate was loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap™ SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1 m NaCl. After washing the column with 5 ml of the equilibration buffer bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1 to 1.0 m NaCl in buffer A. Wild-type and mutant SpCCE1 proteins eluted within the range of 500 to 850 mm NaCl. In each case the peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against protein storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m NaCl, 50% glycerol) before aliquoting and storing at –80 °C. Protein samples were judged to be >95% homogeneous by standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis with Coomassie Blue staining. Amounts of protein were estimated using a modified Bradford assay from Bio-Rad and bovine serum albumin as the standard, and are expressed in molar concentrations of monomer. DNA Substrates—Synthetic Holliday junctions X-12 and X-26, with 12- and 26-bp mobile cores, respectively, were made from ∼50-mer oligonucleotides as described (32Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35063-35073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 49Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Mol.

In the case of X-12 oligonucleotide 2 was labeled with 32P at its 5′ end. Four different preparations of X-26 were made each labeled on a different oligonucleotide so that all cleavage sites could be mapped (see below). The linear duplex was made from oligonucleotides 2 and 13 (49Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The junction (J1) used for the analysis of the SpCCE1-junction complex conformation has been described, as has the preparation of the six junction species that are derived by its restriction digestion (34Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I. Diekmann S. von Kitzing E. Kemper B. Lilley D.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 79-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). χ DNA, which contains a Holliday junction within a ∼300-bp homologous core flanked by heterologous arms of 0.8–1.6 kb, was made as described (4McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This substrate is labeled with 32P on each of its four arms. X-12 and X-26 Cleavage Assays—Reactions for monitoring the rate of X-12 cleavage contained 0.44 nm X-12 in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6% glycerol) plus 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 nm SpCCE1 in a total volume of 70 μl. After preincubation of the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 5 min the reaction was started by the addition of SpCCE1. 10-μl samples were withdrawn at the indicated times and stopped by the addition of one-fifth volume of stop mixture (2.5% SDS, 200 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml proteinase K) followed by a further 10 min at 37 °C. DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Reactions for comparing the cleavage sites made by wild-type and R23G proteins on X-26 were essentially the same as described above except that reaction volumes were 40 μl, contained 10 nm protein and were incubated for 15 min before being stopped. For each protein four reactions were run in parallel each using a different preparation of X-26 labeled on a different strand. DNA products were processed and then analyzed on a 15% denaturing gel as described. All gels were dried and analyzed by phosphoimaging on a Fuji FLA3000. DNA Binding Assays—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 0.44 nm labeled X-12 or linear duplex in binding buffer plus 200 mm NaCl. After adding SpCCE1 as indicated, reactions were left on ice for 10 min before loading on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in low ionic strength buffer (6.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA). Gels were run at 160 V for 105 min, dried, and analyzed as described. For dissociation assays reaction mixtures (60 μl) contained X-12 in binding buffer plus 200 mm NaCl and 15 nm SpCCE1 as above. Reactions were incubated at 22 °C for 5 min prior to loading 10 μl on a 4% gel running at 200 V. 16 μg of competitor DNA (poly(dI·dC)-poly(dI·dC)) (Amersham Biosciences) was then added to the reaction, and 10-μl samples were withdrawn and loaded on the gel at the indicated times. 10-μl samples from control reactions, where competitor DNA was added before SpCCE1, were also loaded on the gel after 5 and 15 min. After loading all the samples, the voltage was reduced to 160 V and electrophoresis was continued for a further 80 min before the gel was dried and analyzed as described. Comparative Gel Electrophoresis—Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained one of the six derivatives of J1 labeled with 32P in binding buffer plus 200 mm NaCl, and either 1 mm EDTA or 200 μm MgCl2 as indicated. Reactions containing between 5 and 15 nm SpCCE1 were left on ice for 10 min before loading on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in TB buffer (90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0) containing either 2 mm EDTA or 0.2 mm MgCl2 as indicated. Gels were run at 140 V for 15 h at 4 °C with continuous buffer recirculation, dried, and analyzed as described. Comparison of χ and X-12 Cleavage—Reaction mixtures (80 μl) contained 32P-labeled χ DNA or X-12 as indicated, and 2.5 nm SpCCE1 in binding buffer containing 200 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2. Reactions were started by the addition of SpCCE1 and incubated at either 25 or 42 °C as indicated. 10-μl samples were withdrawn at the indicated times and stopped by the addition of one-fifth volume of stop mixture followed by a further 10 min at the incubation temperature to deproteinize the mixture. χ Reaction products were then resolved by electrophoresis through a 0.8% agarose gel at 100 V for 80 min, whereas X-12 products were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and analyzed as described. Identification and Mutation of the SAP Motif in SpCCE1— One of the main differences between the structures of SpCCE1 and RuvC is the presence of a small helical domain in SpCCE1 formed by the first two helices and the last third of the C-terminal helix 8 (Fig. 1A) (24Ceschini S. Keeley A. McAlister M.S. Oram M. Phelan J. Pearl L.H. Tsaneva I.R. Barrett T.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6601-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of the SpCCE1 crystal structure onto a Holliday junction, in its approximately square planar “unstacked” conformation, reveals the potential of this helical domain contacting a junction arm via its positively charged surface (24Ceschini S. Keeley A. McAlister M.S. Oram M. Phelan J. Pearl L.H. Tsaneva I.R. Barrett T.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6601-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The presence of helical domains on either side of the SpCCE1 dimer would ensure that two opposing junction arms are contacted (Fig. 1B). We obtained further support for this domain playing a role in junction binding from a RPS-BLAST search of the Conserved Domain Data base (NCBI). This revealed that the N-terminal helices 1 and 2, together with their connecting loop, matches the consensus for the putative DNA binding motif SAP (Fig. 1C) (see Introduction). To further investigate the potential role of the SAP motif in junction binding by SpCCE1, a series of mutant proteins was constructed that contained either deletions or specific amino acid substitutions in this N-terminal region (Fig. 1D). These mutant proteins were then tested in vitro and in vivo as described below. The SAP Motif Is Important for the Ability of SpCCE1 to Resolve Holiday Junctions in Vivo—SpCCE1 is encoded in the nucleus but appears to function exclusively in the mitochondria of fission yeast (22Doe C.L. Osman F. Dixon J. Whitby M.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Deletion of Spcce1 does not result in any overt phenotype, except for an increase in the aggregation of mitochondrial DNA molecules, which is detectable by cytological and Southern blot analysis (22Doe C.L. Osman F. Dixon J. Whitby M.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To provide a more sensitive in vivo assay for comparison of the SpCCE1 mutant proteins, we made use of the ability of SpCCE1 to complement the hypersensitivity to UV light of a resolvase-deficient E. coli strain (20Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A ruvAC – rusA – strain (AM888), which is deleted for both known Holliday junction resolvases in E. coli, was transformed with the plasmid pT7-7 and derivatives expressing SpCCE1 proteins. The effect of these plamids on the survival of AM888 following UV irradiation was then measured (Fig. 2 and Table I). As expected AM888 carrying pT7-7 is very sensitive to UV light, whereas the same strain carrying pMW206, which expresses wild-type SpCCE1, is relatively resistant (Fig. 2A). In fact SpCCE1 is such a good substitute for RuvC and RusA that it improves survival of AM888 by almost 1000-fold following irradiation with 40 J/m2 of UV (Fig. 2A).Table IIn vivo and in vitro activities of wild-type and mutant SpCCE1 proteinsSpCCE1Suppression of ruv - rusA - UV sensitivityaAn E. coli ruv- rusA- strain (AM888) carrying the pT7-7 vector or derivatives encoding wild-type or mutant SpCCE1 proteins were assessed for their UV sensitivity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” + indicates suppression of UV sensitivity; ± indicates partial suppression; and - indicates no suppression (see Fig. 2).Relative rate of cleavage of X-12bRates of cleavage of X-12 are relative to a nominal value for wild-type SpCCE1 of 1.0, and were calculated from the data in Fig. 3.Binding affinity for X-12cApparent dissociation constants (Kd) for SpCCE1·X-12 complexes were estimated from data such as in Fig. 4.Off-rate of SpCCE1·X-12 complexesdThe off-rate of SpCCE1·X-12 complexes is the time taken for 50% of the protein-junction complexes to dissociate, and was calculated from data such as shown in Fig. 5.Unfolds stacked X-junctioneThe ability to unfold junction J1 into an open square planar conformation in the presence of 200 μm MgCl2 (see Fig. 6).∼Kd nmminWild-type+1.03.5∼8YesΔ5±0.432∼1.7NDfND, not determined.Δ15-0.085.5<0.25YesΔ32-NDNDNDNDV4P+0.893>10NDL9P+0.971.5>10NDK14A+0.81.5≥10NDL9P/K14A-0.0076<0.25YesL18G-0.182<0.25NDG22S-0.365<0.25YesG22D-NDNDNDNDR23G-1.572.5<0.25YesK24G-0.694.5<0.25NDR23G/K24G-0.076.8<0.25NDL27P-NDNDNDNDa An E. coli ruv- rusA- strain (AM888) carrying the pT7-7 vector or derivatives encoding wild-type or mutant SpCCE1 proteins were assessed for their UV sensitivity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” + indicates suppression of UV sensitivity; ± indicates partial suppression; and - indicates no suppression (see Fig. 2).b Rates of cleavage of X-12 are relative to a nominal value for wild-type SpCCE1 of 1.0, and were calculated from the data in Fig. 3.c Apparent dissociation constants (Kd) for SpCCE1·X-12 complexes were estimated from data such as in Fig. 4.d The off-rate of SpCCE1·X-12 complexes is the time taken for 50% of the protein-junction complexes to dissociate, and was calculated from data such as shown in Fig. 5.e The ability to unfold junction J1 into an open square planar conformation in the presence of 200 μm MgCl2 (see Fig. 6).f ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Deletion of part or most of the SAP motif (proteins Δ15 and Δ32, respectively) destroys the ability of SpCCE1 to suppress the UV sensitivity of AM888 (Table I). SpCCE1 is similarly affected by single amino acid changes in four of six conserved residues that were analyzed (L18G, G22S, G22D, K24G, and L27P), and one non-conserved residue (R23G) (Fig. 2B and Table I). Furthermore, deletion of the first five amino acids (Δ5) significantly impairs SpCCE1 in vivo (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the mutations V4P, L9P, and K14A have no effect on the ability of SpCCE1 to suppress the UV sensitivity of AM888 (Fig. 2B and Table I). Although, combining L9P and K14A mutations does render SpCCE1 inactive in this assay (Table I). Taken together these data indicate that the SAP motif in SpCCE1 is required for efficient resolution of Holliday junctions in an in vivo system. Impaired Cleavage of Holliday Junctions by SpCCE1 SAP Motif Mutants—To investigate how mutations in the SAP motif affect SpCCE1, His-tagged wild-type and mutant proteins were purified. Three of the mutant proteins (Δ32, G22D, and L27P) proved to be insoluble so were not studied further. The 11 remaining mutant proteins were tested for their ability to resolve the small synthetic Holliday junction substrate X-12. Wild-type SpCCE1 cleaves X-12 extremely well generating increasing amounts of nicked linear duplex product over the 5-min time course of the reaction (Fig. 3, A, lanes a–f, and B). V4P, L9P, and K14A mutant proteins, which fully suppress the UV sensitivity of AM888, also cleave X-12 efficiently (Fig. 3, B and C). Seven mutant proteins (Δ5, L9P/K14A, Δ15, L18G, G22S, K24G, and R23G/K24G) show various reduced cleavage rates (Fig. 3, A, lanes g–l, C–E). Each of these is partially or completely defective for suppression of AM888 UV sensitivity (Table I). However, there is an imperfect correlation between the cleavage rate of X-12 and in vivo activity; e.g. Δ5, G22S, and K24G each have similar cleavage rates in vitro yet only Δ5 retains any ability to suppress AM888 UV sensitivity (Table I). Furthermore, R23G, which cleaves X-12 at least as well as the wild-type protein (Fig. 3E), is apparently impotent in vivo (Fig. 2B). Binding of Holliday Junctions by SpCCE1 SAP Motif Mutants—Because the SAP motif is predicted to be generally required for DNA binding, it was likely that the reduced in vivo and in vitro activity of the SpCCE1 mutant proteins was because of impaired binding to Holliday junctions. To investigate this we measured the ability of the mutant proteins to bind X-12 using a standard band-shift assay. Wild-type SpCCE1 binds to X-12 to form two complexes (Fig. 4A, lanes a–g). Complex 1 is formed by the binding of a single dimer of SpCCE1 to X-12, whereas, complex 2 is formed by the binding of two dimers (20Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 509-"
https://openalex.org/W2093476812,"In eukaryotic cells, protein kinase CKII is required for progression through the cell division cycle. We recently reported that CKBBP1/SAG/ROC2/Rbx2 associates with the β-subunit of CKII and is phosphorylated by purified CKII in the presence of ATP in vitro. In this report, we demonstrate that CKBBP1 is efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by purified CKII in the presence of GTP and by heparin-sensitive protein kinase in HeLa cell extract. Mutational analysis indicates that CKII phosphorylates threonine at residue 10 within CKBBP1. Furthermore, CKBBP1 is phosphorylated in vivo and threonine to alanine mutation at residue 10 abrogates the phosphorylation of CKBBP1 observed in vivo, indicating that CKII is a major kinase that is responsible for in vivo phosphorylation of CKBBP1. As compared with the wild-type CKBBP1 or CKBBP1T10E (in which threonine 10 is replaced by glutamate), overexpression of nonphosphorylatable CKBBP1 (CKBBP1T10A) results in accumulation of IκBα and p27Kip1. Experiments using proteasome inhibitor MG132 and CKII inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole suggest that the accumulation of IκBα and p27Kip1 results primarily from the reduction of proteasomal degradation in cells expressing CKBBP1T10A, and that CKII-mediated CKBBP1 phosphorylation is required for efficient degradation of IκBα and p27Kip1. Overexpression of CKBBP1T10A in HeLa cells suppresses cell proliferation and causes accumulation of G1/G0 peak of the cell cycle. Taken together, our results indicate that CKII may control IκBα and p27Kip1 degradation and thereby G1/S phase transition through the phosphorylation of threonine 10 within CKBBP1.

(formerly known as casein kinase II) is a ubiquitous and highly conserved serine/threonine kinase, which is found in all eukaryotes examined and in various subcellular compartments (1Pinna L.A.

The holoenzyme of CKII is a heterotetramer, composed of two catalytic (α and/or α′) and two regulatory (β) subunits. The α and α′ subunits are different gene products and exhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The β subunit is thought to be a regulatory subunit that modulates the catalytic activity of α or α′ subunits and also mediates tetramer formation and substrate recognition (4Lin W.J. Tuazon P.T.

Crystal structure of the catalytic subunit α has confirmed the constitutively active nature of CKII (7Niefind K. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Schomburg D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2451-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of CKII is inhibited strongly by heparin and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) and stimulated by polybasic compounds (8Hathaway G.M. Lubben T.H. Traugh J.A.

It has been suggested that CKII plays a significant role in the control of cell proliferation and transformation. CKII is known to catalyze the phosphorylation of a broad spectrum of substrates, which are involved in cell growth and proliferation, including DNA-binding proteins, nuclear oncoproteins, and transcription factors (1Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 2Issinger O.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 3Allende J.E.

Overexpression of CKIIα in the T cells of transgenic mice results in a high predisposition for lymphoma formation, and coexpression with c-Myc results in the rapid development of leukemia (14Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CKIIα or CKIIα′ exhibits cooperativity with Ras in the transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts and Balb/c 3T3 cells (15Orlandini M. Semplici F. Ferruzzi R. Meggio F. Pinna L.A.

An important role of CKII in cell cycle control has also been demonstrated in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The analysis using temperature-sensitive mutants for the CKII gene has shown that CKII is required for cell cycle progression in both G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (19Hanna D.E. Rethinaswamy A. Glover C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25905-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that CKII plays a significant role in cell proliferation and cell cycle control. However, its precise role in cell cycle progression remains largely unknown. In our previous study, we reported that a protein called CKBBP1 (CKIIβ-binding protein 1) is a cellular interaction partner of the β subunit of CKII (20Son M.-Y. Park J.-W. Kim Y.-S. Kang S.-W. Marshak D.R. Park W. Bae Y.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This protein has also been identified by others and given the name SAG (sensitive to apoptosis gene) (21Duan H. Wang Y. Aviram M. Swaroop M. Loo J.A. Bian J. Tian Y. Mueller T. Bisgaier C.L. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3145-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). CKBBP1/SAG is a Ring-H2 finger motif-containing protein with a molecular weight of 12.6 kDa. It is localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of cells (21Duan H. Wang Y. Aviram M. Swaroop M. Loo J.A. Bian J. Tian Y. Mueller T. Bisgaier C.L. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3145-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). CKBBP1/SAG was subsequently found to be the second member of regulator of cullin (ROC)/RING box protein (Rbx)/Hrt. ROC1/Rbx1/Hrt1 has been originally identified as the fourth component of SCF (Skip1-Cullin-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex as well as von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor complex (22Ohta T.

In the present study, we show the evidence that CKBBP1 is phosphorylated on threonine residue at position 10 by CKII in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, disruption of this phosphorylation in CKBBP1 results in accumulation of IκBα and p27Kip1 in HeLa cells and inhibits cell proliferation that appears to be linked to defects in G1/S transition. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting physiological significance of the post-translational modification of CKBBP1/SAG/ROC2/Rbx2. Antibodies—Polyclonal anti-CKBBP1 antibody was raised against recombinant CKBBP1 as described elsewhere (20Son M.-Y. Park J.-W. Kim Y.-S. Kang S.-W. Marshak D.R. Park W. Bae Y.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-CKIIα and monoclonal anti-CKIIβ antibodies were obtained from Calbiochem. Polyclonal anti-IκBα and anti-β-actin antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal anti-p27Kip1 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Plasmid Constructions—The bacterial expression vector pET14b-CKBBP1, which expresses the full-length CKBBP1 with a hexahistidine (His) tag to the N terminus, was described previously (20Son M.-Y. Park J.-W. Kim Y.-S. Kang S.-W. Marshak D.R. Park W. Bae Y.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Point mutations in CKBBP1 were made using either the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) or PCR method. Desired mutations were incorporated into oligonucleotide primers. The primers used for threonine to alanine mutagenesis at positions 10 and 49 were 5′-AGACGGAGAGGAAGCATGCGCCCTGGCCT-3′ and 5′-GACGTGGAGTGCGATGCATGCGCCATCTG-3′, respectively. The primers used for serine to alanine mutagenesis at positions 24 and 42 were 5′-TCCGGGAGCTCAGGCTCCAAGGCGGGAGGCG-3′ and 5′-GCGGTGGCCATGTGGGCCTGGGACGTGGAGTGC-3′, respectively. The mutation sites are underlined. The mutagenesis was performed as described by the manufacturer. After digestion of the mutation products with NdeI and XhoI, the fragment ligated into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pET14b (Clontech). To replace threonine 10 with glutamic acid, CKBBP1 cDNA was PCR-amplified by using N-terminal mutagenic primer (5′-ACGCCATATGGCCGACGTGGAAGACGGAGAGGAAGAGTGCGC-3′) and C-terminal reverse primer (5′-CTAACTCGAGTCATTTGCCGATTCTTT-3′). The mutation site is underlined. After digestion of the PCR products with NdeI and XhoI, the fragment was ligated into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pET14b. To generate a Myc-His-tagged CKBBP1 expression construct, the wild-type and mutant CKBBP1 cDNAs were PCR-amplified using primers 5′-CCGGAATTCCGCCATGGCCGACGTGGAAGA-3′ and 5′-GCGGGATCCATTTGCCGATTCTTTGGACCA-3′. The PCR fragments were digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and then subcloned into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen). To generate a GFP-tagged CKBBP1 expression construct, the wild-type and mutant CKBBP1 cDNAs were PCR-amplified using primers 5′-CGCGGCCTCGAGATGGCCGACGTGGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTATCGGATCCCCTTTGCCGATTCTTTG-3′. The PCR fragments were digested with XhoI and BamHI, and then subcloned into XhoI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Purification of CKII and CKBBP1—Human CKBBP1, CKII holoenzyme, and CKIIβ were expressed and purified in Escherichia coli as described previously (20Son M.-Y. Park J.-W. Kim Y.-S. Kang S.-W. Marshak D.R. Park W. Bae Y.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Kim M.-S. Lee Y.-T. Kim J.-M. Cha J.-Y. Bae Y.-S. Mol. Cell. 1988; 8: 43-48Google Scholar). CKII Activity Assay—The standard assay for phosphotransferase activity of CKII was conducted in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 1 mm synthetic peptide substrate (RRREEETEEE) in a total volume of 30 μl at 30 °C. The reactions were started by the addition of purified CKII, HeLa cell lysates, or CKBBP1 co-precipitates and incubated for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% and centrifuged, and 10 μl of supernatant was then applied to P-81 paper. The paper was washed in 100 mm phosphoric acid, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Phosphorylation of CKBBP1 by CKII—Phosphorylation of His-tagged CKBBP1 by CKII was performed in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 6 μg of His-tagged CKBBP1 in a total volume of 30 μl. The reactions were started by the addition of purified CKII or HeLa cell lysates and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The samples were then separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed essentially as described by others (31Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Briefly, the His-tagged CKBBP1 protein was phosphorylated CKII and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described above. After staining of the gel with Coomassie blue, the His-tagged CKBBP1 protein band was excised and the protein was extracted in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% SDS. The proteins were precipitated in 15% trichloroacetic acid with 20 μg of bovine serum albumin as carrier, washed in 100% ethanol, dried, and hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysate was lyophilized and resuspended in 7 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (7.8% acetic acid and 2.2% formic acid) containing phosphoamino acid standards. The samples were spotted on cellulose thin-layer plates, and electrophoresis was performed using pH 1.9 buffer. Standards were visualized with ninhydrin and 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. Determination of Kinetic Constants—K m and V max values were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk transformations of initial rates using the computer program Sigma Plot. Cell Culture and Establishment of Stable Cell Line—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For serum starvation, HeLa cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then grown in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 36 h prior to harvest. To establish CKBBP1-expressing stable cell lines, HeLa cells were transfected with the Myc-His-tagged CKBBP1 constructs or the vector control by LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. One day later, the cells were cultured in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418. After 2 weeks, the clones were picked and grown in the same medium in the presence of 100 μg/ml. Stable clones were examined for protein expression by Western blotting. Preparation of HeLa Cell Extract—For Western blotting and Ni pull-down assay, ∼1 × 106 HeLa cells in 100-mm dishes were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected by scraping with a rubber policeman, and lysed in 100 μl of ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). For CKII activity assay, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 4 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) by sonication. The particulate debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. The volumes of the supernatants were adjusted for equal protein concentration. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h and then incubated with specific antibodies. The membrane was washed three times in TBST, and then treated with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). Some membranes were stripped in stripping buffer (2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) at 50 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody as a control for protein loading. Pull-down Assays—Ni-NTA agarose beads and lysates from HeLa cells that were transfected with the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His-CKBBP1 were incubated in 200 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h while rocking at 4 °C. After the beads were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 20 mm imidazole), the bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 200 mm imidazole), denatured in 4× SDS reducing protein gel loading buffer, and then resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The eluted proteins were visualized by Western blotting with anti-CKIIα, anti-CKIIβ, or anti-CKBBP1 antibodies. Metabolic 32P Labeling—HeLa cells transfected with Myc-His-CKBBP1 were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate at 0.4 mCi/ml in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h at 37 °Cin5%CO2. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and precipitated with Ni-NTA agarose. After the beads were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 20 mm imidazole), the bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 200 mm imidazole), denatured in 4× SDS reducing protein gel loading buffer, and then resolved using 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. RNA Binding Assay—Wild-type and mutant CKBBP1 were incubated with poly(U)-agarose (Sigma) in RNA binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 μm ZnCl2, 2% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C for 1 h. After an extensive washing, the immobilized proteins were recovered by an elution with 500 mm NaCl, separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and then immunoblotted with anti-CKBBP1 antibody. Subcellular Localization of CKBBP1—To determine the subcellular localization of the wild-type and mutant CKBBP1, GFP-tagged CKBBP1 was transiently expressed in HeLa cells. Green fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal microscope after 48 h of transfection. Growth Curves—HeLa cells stably expressing the wild-type and mutant CKBBP1 were seeded in 6-well dishes at a starting density of 5,000 cells/well, with duplicate wells for each cell line. Every 24 h, cells were trypsinized and counted in triplicate using a hemocytometer. Trypan blue was used to distinguish viable cells from non-viable cells. FACS Analysis—HeLa cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 100-mm dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 36 h later, the cells were collected in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum, fixed in 65% ethanol for 1 h at 4 °C, and then incubated in 50 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A (Sigma), 25 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), and 0.6% sodium citrate for 30 min at 37 °C. Flow cytometric determination of cellular DNA content was performed on a Coulter Elite ESP Cell Sorter (Beckman). The forward and side scatter gates were set to exclude any dead cells from the analysis; 10,000 events within this gate were acquired per sample. CKBBP1 Is Phosphorylated by CKII in Vitro—We have shown previously that CKBBP1 is phosphorylated by CKII in vitro (20Son M.-Y. Park J.-W. Kim Y.-S. Kang S.-W. Marshak D.R. Park W. Bae Y.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To confirm the phosphorylation of CKBBP1 by CKII, His-CKBBP1 was incubated with purified CKII in the presence of [γ-32P]GTP, because it has been shown that, unlike other protein kinases, CKII can utilize GTP instead of ATP as the phosphate donor (32Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1982; 21: 101-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, CKII phosphorylated CKBBP1 in the presence of GTP as the phosphate donor. In order to further characterize the nature of CKBBP1 phosphorylation by CKII, a kinetic analysis was performed. The K m was 6.25 μm, and the V max was 232.6 pmol/min/mg with CKBBP1 as a substrate of CKII (Fig. 1B). These parameters were comparable with reports of CKII kinetics with other protein substrates. For example, the K m value obtained for CKBBP1 was greater than the value obtained for topoisomerase II (0.4 μm), but it was lower than the value obtained for tubulin (20 μm) (33Ackerman P. Glover C.V.C. Osheroff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3164-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 34Serrano L. Diaz-Nido J. Wandosell F. Avila J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1731-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). With a K m in the submicromolar range, we conclude that CKBBP1 is an efficient substrate for CKII. CKII Is a Predominant CKBBP1 Kinase in HeLa Cell Extract—To determine whether CKII is a predominant CKBBP1 kinase in mammalian cells, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using purified His-CKBBP1 and whole cell extract from HeLa cells with and without the addition of CKII inhibitors heparin and DRB. Following the kinase reaction, the His-CKBBP1 protein was precipitated with Ni-NTA agarose and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2, His-CKBBP1 was phosphorylated by HeLa cell extract and the CKBBP1 phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by CKII inhibitors heparin and DRB. Quantification by liquid scintillation counting of the 32P-labeled CKBBP1 bands revealed that 0.3 μm heparin and 50 μm DRB inhibited 89 and 70% of the phosphorylation by HeLa cell extract, respectively. Coomassie blue staining of the gel showed that CKBBP1 was equivalent in each reaction (left panel of Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that CKBBP1 is phosphorylated predominantly by a heparin- and DRB-sensitive kinase in cell extract. CKII Phosphorylates Threonine at Residue 10 within CKBBP1 in Vitro—To determine the nature of the phosphorylated residue, we performed phosphoamino acid analysis of CKBBP1 labeled with 32P in vitro. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that phosphorylation of CKBBP1 occurred exclusively on threonine, but not on serine or tyrosine residues (Fig. 3A). There are only two threonine residues at positions 10 and 49 within the polypeptide chain of CKBBP1. In order to determine the CKII-phosphorylation site within CKBBP1, both threonine residues were replaced by alanine. For the control experiment, serine residues at positions 24 and 42 were substituted by alanine. This resulted in the following CKBBP1 mutants: CKBBP1T10A, CKBBP1T49A, CKBBP1S24A, and CKBBP1S42A. The mutant CKBBP1 proteins were expressed and purified in E. coli and subjected to phosphorylation by CKII. As shown in Fig. 3B, the CKII-mediated phosphorylation was completely abolished in CKBBP1T10A, but not in CKBBP1T49A, showing that the threonine 10 was the only CKII phosphorylation site in CKBBP1. Serine to alanine mutations had no significant effect on the CKBBP1 phosphorylation by CKII. To determine whether threonine at residue 10 within CKBBP1 is phosphorylated by HeLa cell extract-derived kinases, His-CKBBP1WT and His-CKBBP1T10A were added to HeLa cell extract and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. After precipitation with Ni-NTA agarose beads, the CKBBP1 proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3C, alanine mutation of threonine 10 completely abolished the CKBBP1 phosphorylation by HeLa cell extract-derived kinases. These results demonstrate that threonine at residue 10 is the only site for CKBBP1 phosphorylation in the whole cell extract. CKII preferentially phosphorylates serine/threonine residues followed by a stretch of acidic residues on the immediate C-terminal side (+1 to +3). Among these acidic residues, the third position after the phosphoacceptor is the most improtant determinant. However, further analyses have indicated that acidic residues located at positions –2 to +7 can also serve as specificity determinants for CKII phosphorylation (1Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 35Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar). Our current observation also indicates that CKII phosphorylates serine/threonine residue without any acidic amino acids at positions +1 to +3 after phosphoacceptor. In case of CKII-mediated CKBBP1 phosphorylation, instead, two acidic residues locate at positions –1 and –2 before the phosphoacceptor (Fig. 3D). Threonine 10 within CKBBP1 Is Phosphorylated by CKII in Vivo—To determine whether the CKBBP1 protein is phosphorylated on threonine at residue 10 in vivo, HeLa cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding Myc-His-CKBBP1WT or Myc-His-CKBBP1T10A. The empty vector (pcDNA3.1/Myc-His) was used as a control. After selection for G418 resistance, the stable expression of CKBBP1 was examined by immunoblotting with anti-CKBBP1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, the stable expression of Myc-His-CKBBP1 was detectable in HeLa cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1/Myc-His-CKBBP1. However, Myc-His-CKBBP1 was not detectable in cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector alone. Using these stable cell lines, we metabolically 32P-labeled CKBBP1 in HeLa cells. Myc-His-CKBBP1WT and Myc-His-CKBBP1T10A were precipitated from these cells with Ni-NTA agarose resin and the pr"
https://openalex.org/W2157361454,"We have characterized the C215D active-site mutant of protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) and solved the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of the apoenzyme to a resolution of 1.6 Å. The mutant enzyme displayed maximal catalytic activity at pH ∼4.5, which is significantly lower than the pH optimum of 6 for wild-type PTP-1B. Although both forms of the enzyme exhibited identical K m values for hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate at pH 4.5 and 6, the k cat values of C215D were ∼70- and ∼7000-fold lower than those of wild-type PTP-1B, respectively. Arrhenius plots revealed that the mutant and wild-type enzymes displayed activation energies of 61 ± 1 and 18 ± 2 kJ/mol, respectively, at their pH optima. Unlike wild-type PTP-1B, C215D-mediated p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis was inactivated by 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane, suggesting a direct involvement of Asp215 in catalysis. Increasing solvent microviscosity with sucrose (up to 40% (w/v)) caused a significant decrease in k cat/K m of the wild-type enzyme, but did not alter the catalytic efficiency of the mutant protein. Structurally, the apoenzyme was identical to wild-type PTP-1B, aside from the flexible WPD loop region, which was in both “open” and “closed” conformations. At physiological pH, the C215D mutant of PTP-1B should be an effective substrate-trapping mutant that can be used to identify cellular substrates of PTP-1B. In addition, because of its insensitivity to oxidation, this mutant may be used for screening fermentation broth and other natural products to identify inhibitors of PTP-1B.

In addition, because of its insensitivity to oxidation, this mutant may be used for screening fermentation broth and other natural products to identify inhibitors of PTP-1B. The protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) 1The abbreviations used are: PTPases, protein-tyrosine phosphatases; PTP-1B, protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; EPNP, 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane. compose a family of ∼100 enzymes that play an important role in controlling several biological processes, including cell cycles and signal transduction pathways (1van Huijsduijnen R.H. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Zhang Z.-Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). One member of this family of phosphatases that is receiving increased attention because of its potential role in controlling the insulin signaling pathway is protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B). Studies have suggested that this ubiquitously expressed enzyme may play a role in regulating the function of the insulin receptor. Thus, PTP-1B is an attractive target for drug design in the treatment of Type II diabetes (for reviews, see Refs. 3Kennedy B.P. Ramachandran C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar and 4Ukkola O. Santaniemi M. J. Intern. Med. 2002; 251: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Like other PTPases, PTP-1B contains a conserved 11-residue sequence motif (i.e. (I/V)HCXAGXXR(S/T)G) that harbors Cys215, which acts as the nucleophile and is essential for catalysis. The signature motif also forms the “P-loop” that is involved in substrate binding and catalysis. It is thought that PTP-1B-mediated catalysis occurs via a double-displacement mechanism in which the phosphoryl group of the substrate is first transferred to the active-site Cys residue (Cys215) (5Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cho H. Krishnaraj R. Bannwarth W. Walsh C.T. Anderson K.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 7296-7298Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The initial phosphoryl transfer is assisted by an invariant Asp residue (Asp181) residing in a flexible loop region (WPD loop) that spans the conserved tripeptide Trp-Pro-Asp. It is generally believed that Asp181 first acts as a general acid and protonates the leaving group in the phosphorylation step. Subsequently, Asp181 functions as a general base, abstracting a proton from an attacking water molecule in the dephosphorylation step to enhance the rate of hydrolysis of the enzyme-thiophosphate intermediate (7Zhang Z.-Y.

Previous structural studies on PTP-1B have revealed interesting details regarding the conformations and structural organizations of the WPD loop and P-loop regions. Specifically, the WPD loop has been shown to adopt different conformations in the unliganded and liganded forms of the enzyme. In the unliganded structure, the WPD loop is in an open conformation, in which Asp181 is ∼10 Å away from the P-loop. Upon substrate binding, the WPD loop adopts a closed conformation and covers the active site like a “flap,” thereby positioning Asp181 closer to the leaving group (11Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 12Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In wild-type PTP-1B, Cys215 is present as a thiolate (13Dillet V. Van Etten R.L. Bashford D. J. Phys. Chem. 2000; 104: 11321-11333Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and it is known that this active-site residue is absolutely necessary for PTP-1B-mediated catalysis. Mutation of this residue to a neutral Ser generates a “substrate-trapping” mutant, which is able to bind substrates with affinities similar to those of the wild-type enzyme, but does not display any measurable phosphatase activity (14Zhang Z.-Y. Wu L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Skorey K.I. Kennedy B.P. Friesen R.W. Ramachandran C. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 291: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the unliganded C215S PTP-1B mutant shows the P-loop in a conformationally distinct orientation compared with that found in the wild-type protein. However, in the liganded form, the P-loop adopts the same conformation as the wild-type protein. In the C215S mutant, substitution of the negatively charged thiolate with a neutral (although polar) alcohol destabilizes the PTPase signature motif loop (P-loop) and the surrounding areas, favoring the extended conformation (16Scapin G. Patel S. Patel V. Kennedy B. Asante-Appiah E. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The structural studies therefore suggest that the conformation of the P-loop region of the enzyme is inducible and may be dependent on the presence of the negative charge of the active-site nucleophile. The goal of this study was to explore the importance of the presence of a negatively charged residue other than Cys at position 215 in the conformation of the P-loop and in the catalytic activity of PTP-1B. We therefore substituted Cys215 with Asp, as this residue is similar in charge and size density to the active-site thiolate. Here, we report the functional characterization and crystal structure of the C215D mutant enzyme and compare these properties with those of wild-type PTP-1B. Materials—Bovine serum albumin and the SuperSignal™ West Pico immunoblotting kit were obtained from Pierce. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were purchased from Invitrogen, and Escherichia coli BL21 cells were obtained from Stratagene. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and protease inhibitors were from Roche Applied Science. The Cibacron blue and Sepharose Q columns were bought from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. General Methods—Protein concentrations were determined by a microplate adaptation of the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (47Bradford M.M. Anal. Chem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of purified mutant and wild-type PTP-1B, proteins were boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 5–10 min and then separated on 10–20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gradient gels containing SDS. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose at a constant voltage of 100 V for 90 min. The blot was subsequently probed with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and detected by chemiluminescence. The SuperSignal™ West Pico kit was used for immunoblotting of proteins following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Mutagenesis and Protein Expression—A plasmid containing the isolated catalytic domain of human PTP-1B (residues 1–298) in a pFLAG vector was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. The Cys-to-Asp mutation was introduced using a PCR-based approach following established procedures (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates/John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). The resulting construct was verified by DNA sequencing on an ABI 373 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems), and the sequence data were analyzed using the software application package Sequencher Version 4.0.5 (Gene Code Corp.). The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells for protein expression. The bacterial cultures were grown in LB broth at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm to an absorbance of 0.7. The cultures were then induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for an additional 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell lysates were analyzed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting using the protocol outlined above. Purification of Mutant and Wild-type PTP-1B—Purification of mutant and wild-type PTP-1B was performed as outlined previously (18Asante-Appiah E. Ball K. Bateman K. Skorey K. Friesen R. Desponts C. Payette P. Bayly C. Zamboni R. Scapin G. Ramachandran C. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26036-26043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli BL21 cells transformed with the expression vector were suspended in lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and two tablets of Complete™ protease inhibitors/50 ml of solution at a final pH of 7.5. Cell lysis was achieved by passing cells twice through an ice-chilled French pressure cell (SLM-AMINCO) at 16,000 p.s.i. The supernatant was retained following centrifugation of the cell lysate at 31,000 × g for 30 min and then applied to a Cibacron blue affinity column pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer without protease inhibitors (binding buffer A). Following application of the supernatant, the affinity column was washed with 20 column volumes of binding buffer A or until the absorbance at 280 nm returned to base-line levels. The protein was then eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–500 mm) in binding buffer A over 10 column volumes. PTP-1B-rich fractions were determined by analyzing the fractions by SDS-PAGE and also by measuring PTPase activity. The appropriate fractions were pooled, and the ionic strength was adjusted to 100 mm NaCl. The partially purified preparation was subsequently applied to a Sepharose Q anion-exchange column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.5 (binding buffer B). The column was then washed with binding buffer B to return the absorbance at 280 nm to base-line levels. Next, the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of increasing NaCl concentrations (100–500 mm) over 8 column volumes. The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by measuring enzyme activity; the appropriate fractions were then pooled. The purified protein preparation was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, and 20% (v/v) glycerol at pH 7.5 prior to storage at –80 °C. All steps in the purification scheme were carried out at 4 °C or on ice with the aid of a fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus (Amersham Biosciences); a flow rate of 1 ml/min was used in all chromatographic steps. Activity Assays—Assays were carried out in a 96-well format at 22 °C in buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm MES, 50 mm acetic acid, N,N′-dimethylbis(mercaptoacetyl)hydrazine, 2 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) Me2SO, 2% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 at the appropriate pH. The use of this triple-component buffering system minimizes changes in ionic strength across a pH range of 3–9 (19Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was quantitated by monitoring C215D or wild-type PTP-1B-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) to p-nitrophenol. Briefly, pNPP hydrolysis was measured by incubating C215D or wild-type PTP-1B with 0–10 mm pNPP for 30 or 4 min, respectively, and then stopping the reaction by adding NaOH to a final concentration of 1 m. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured on a Cytofluor II™ plate reader, and the catalytic activity was calculated using the molar extinction coefficient of the p-nitrophenolate anion (18,800 m–1 cm–1). The observed rates of reactions were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the nonlinear curve fitting software program Grafit Version 4.0.10 (Erithacus Software Inc.) to determine kinetic constants. To extract pK app values from the pH-response studies, the data were also fitted using nonlinear regression analysis (SigmaPlot, Jandel Scientific). For collection of Arrhenius plot data, C215D and wild-type PTP-1B activities were measured at their respective pH optima at 10–37 °C (±0.5 °C) using 10 mm pNPP as a substrate and an assay time of 30 or 4 min, respectively. The data were transformed into Arrhenius plots, and the slopes of the lines were obtained using linear regression with the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm (SigmaPlot). For inactivation assays using 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane (EPNP), the epoxide was dissolved in Me2SO and added to the reaction mixtures to a final concentration of 2.4 mm. Following incubation of the enzymes for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of EPNP, the catalytic activities were determined at their respective pH optima as described above. Viscosity Studies—The effect of viscosity on C215D or wild-type PTP-1B activity was determined by measuring pNPP hydrolysis using the protocol outlined above in reaction mixtures containing 0–40% (w/v) sucrose. Stock solutions of sucrose were prepared at twice the desired final concentration in assay buffer (pH 4.5 or 6) and added to the reaction mixtures to obtain a 2-fold dilution. The plates were continuously shaken during the incubation time to maintain homogeneity of the reaction mixtures. Relative solvent viscosities (ηrel = η/ηo, where the superscript o denotes the reaction in buffer lacking sucrose) were calculated using the solution densities at 22 °C (20Bubnik Z. Kadlek D. Urban D. Bruhns M. Sugar Technologists Manual. Verlag Dr. Albert Bartens KG, Berlin1995Google Scholar, 21Mathlouthi M. Genotelle J. Sucrose: Properties and Applications. Blackie Academic and Professional, Glasgow, United Kingdom1995Crossref Google Scholar). The calculated relative viscosities used in these experiments were 1.00, 1.37, 2.02, 3.32, and 6.39 for 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40% (w/v) sucrose solutions, respectively. Crystallization and Data Collection—Apo-C215D crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion in sitting drops at 4 °C by mixing 2 μl of protein (10 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, 50 NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm N,N′-dimethylbis(mercaptoacetyl)hydrazine, pH 7.0) and 2 μl of precipitant solution (13–16% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mm HEPES, and 200 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0). X-ray diffraction data were collected on an ADSC Q210 detector from a single crystal (∼0.3 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm in size) using synchrotron radiation. Data to 1.6 Å were collected at beamline 17-ID in the facilities of the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallography Association Collaborative Access Team at the Advanced Photon Source. Data processing, scaling, and merging were done with the software DPS/MOSFLM (22Rossmann M.G. van Beek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1631-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 23Leslie A.G.W. Crystallographic Computing. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990Google Scholar). The crystal was trigonal, with space group P312 and unit cell parameters a = b = 88.45 Å, c = 104.36 Å, α = β = 90.0°, and γ = 120°. See “Results” for the statistics for the data collected. Structure Solution and Refinement—The crystal was isomorphous to previously reported PTP-1B crystals (i.e. Protein Data Bank 1PTY) (24Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13420-13425Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), and the three-dimensional structure of the C215D mutant was solved by difference Fourier analysis using, as the initial model, the 1.8-Å structure of the mutant enzyme in complex with phosphotyrosine (Protein Data Bank code 1PTY). Bound ligand, solvent molecules, and protein residues 175–184 (WPD loop) and 213–223 (P-loop) were deleted from the coordinate file. The initial electron density maps to 2.4 Å calculated from this model showed that the WPD loop was in a closed conformation and that the peptide containing the catalytic site mutation assumed the same conformation observed in the wild-type enzyme (see Fig. 4). Both loops were built into the available density using the graphic software O (25Jones A.T. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Refinement of the model was carried out by alternating cycles of manual rebuilding of the model in O and computer-based refinement using CNX, slowly including all available data to 1.6-Å resolution. Typically, two cycles of torsion angle dynamics and positional and temperature factor refinement were run in each cycle. Bulk solvent correction was applied throughout the entire refinement, and the refinement was performed using the cross-validated maximal likelihood approach (26Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Acta Cryst. Sect. A. 1996; 52: 659-668Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 27Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brünger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). When high resolution data were included, it became evident in the electron density maps that the WPD loop (Thr177–Ser188) was present in both “open” and “closed” conformations. Several other residues were also modeled as having dual conformation for their side chains; the occupancy for atoms in dual conformations was initially set to 50% for each conformer and then manually adjusted to reflect the temperature factors. At the end of the refinement, 30 additional cycles of occupancy refinement were carried out for the atoms modeled in the alternate configurations. See “Results” for the statistics for the refined model. To evaluate the importance of a negatively charged residue at position 215 of PTP-1B, we substituted Cys215 with Asp. The isosteric nature of this amino acid replacement minimizes the introduction of structural perturbations in the conformation of the P-loop. Following expression and purification of the C215D mutant, the functional and structural properties of the enzyme were compared with those of wild-type PTP-1B. Effect of pH on C215D Activity—We investigated the pH dependence of C215D and wild-type PTP-1B-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP at pH 3.5–9 (Fig. 1). Although the pH profiles were generally bell-shaped for both enzymes, suggesting the existence of two ionizable amino acid side chains involved in catalysis, significant differences in the profiles were noted. As expected, wild-type PTP-1B displayed maximal catalytic activity at pH 6.0; however, when the active-site Cys was replaced with Asp, the pH optimum of the enzyme was shifted to 4.5–4.7. Interestingly, the pH profiles showed very little overlap, and significant differences in the relative levels of catalytic activity were observed at the pH optima of the two enzymes. For example, at pH 4.5, where the C215D mutant displayed maximal activity, the catalytic activity of wild-type PTP-1B was <5% of its maximum. Similarly, whereas wild-type PTP-1B exhibited maximal catalytic activity at pH 6, only 15% of the maximal catalytic activity of the C215D mutant was present. From the pH profiles, the first and second apparent ionization constants of the enzyme-substrate complexes (i.e. pK 1(app) and pK 2(app)) for wild-type PTP-1B were estimated to be ∼5.5 and 6.8, respectively. Due to the steep slope of the acid limb of the pH profile for the C215D mutant, the pK 1(app) could not be determined accurately, and it could only be estimated that the value was between 4.3 and 4.5. According to the pH profile, the pK 2(app) of the mutant enzyme (∼5.5) was also significantly lower than that of wild-type PTP-1B. These results clearly show that the two forms of the enzyme displayed distinct pH dependences with respect to substrate hydrolysis. Comparison of K m , k cat , and E act of Mutant and Wild-type PTP-1B—Next, we compared the kinetic parameters of the C215D mutant with those of wild-type PTP-1B. Table I shows a comparison of the kinetic parameters of C215D and wild-type PTP-1B-mediated pNPP hydrolysis at the determined pH optima. Although both enzymes displayed similar K m values of 1.1–1.4 mm, the k cat values of the C215D mutant were ∼70- and ∼7000-fold lower than those of wild-type PTP-1B at pH 4.5 and 6, respectively.Table IKinetic parameters of C215D and wild-type PTP-1B-mediated pNPP hydrolysis at pH 4.5 and 6PTP-1BKmkcatpH 4.5pH 6pH 4.5pH 6mms-1C215D5.4 ± 0.41.1 ± 0.10.025 ± 0.0010.004 ± 0.001Wild-type5.8 ± 1.71.4 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.331.0 ± 1.1 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the observed differences in k cat between the mutant and wild-type enzymes could be at least partially explained by potential differences in the thermodynamics of catalysis, we compared the activation energies (E act) of C215D and wild-type PTP-1B-catalyzed pNPP hydrolysis by measuring the catalytic activities as a function of temperature. The Arrhenius plots and the corresponding calculated E act values for C215D and wild-type PTP-1B are shown in Fig. 2 and Table II, respectively. The Arrhenius plot for wild-type PTP-1B-mediated catalysis was continuous over the temperature range of 10–35 °C, with E act = 18 ± 2 kJ/mol. At temperatures above 35 °C, significant denaturation of the enzyme was observed (data not shown). The C215D mutant was more thermally labile, and a continuous Arrhenius plot was obtained only up to 32 °C. Above this temperature, the Arrhenius plot also began to level off due to thermal denaturation of the enzyme. Interestingly, the E act for the C215D mutant (i.e. 61 ± 1 kJ/mol) was >3-fold higher than that for wild-type PTP-1B.Table IIActivation energies for pNPP hydrolysis by C215D and wild-type PTP-1BPTP-1BEactkJ/molC215D61 ± 1Wild-type18 ± 2 Open table in a new tab Inactivation of C215D-mediated Catalysis by EPNP—EPNP is a potent inactivator of enzymes that possess an active-site carboxyl residue (for example, see Refs. 28Tang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4510-4517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Rose R.B. Rose J.R. Salto R. Craik C.S. Stroud R.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10691-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Irreversible inactivation is presumably due to alkylation of the active-site carboxyl residue by the epoxide moiety of EPNP. Because the C215D mutant contains a carboxyl residue in its active site, we wished to determine the effect of EPNP on the catalytic activity of this mutant derivative of PTP-1B. We therefore monitored the amount of C215D and wild-type PTP-1B catalytic activities that remained following a 1-h incubation of the enzymes at 4 °C in the presence of 2.4 mm EPNP. The activity of the mutant protein was reduced by >80% following incubation of the enzyme in the presence of the inactivator (Fig. 3). However, the activity of wild-type PTP-1B was not significantly affected under similar conditions. As the only amino acid difference between the mutant and wild-type enzymes was the substitution of the catalytic Cys215 with Asp in the derivative, we conclude that EPNP inactivated C215D through alkylation of the carboxyl group of Asp215. Crystal Structure of the Apo-C215D Mutant—To evaluate the effect of the Cys-to-Asp substitution on the tertiary structure of PTP-1B, we solved the x-ray crystal structure of the mutant enzyme and refined it against 1.6-Å data. The final model had a crystallographic R-factor of 18.6% (R free is 20.4%) for 59,409 reflections between 15.0 and 1.6 Å (5% flagged for R free calculation) and maintained good geometry (root mean square deviations for bond lengths and bond angles of 0.01 Å and 1.5°, respectively (Table III)). The backbone conformation of 91.6% of the residues was within the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, with none in disallowed regions, as defined using PROCHECK (31Laskoswski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss S.D. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The side chains of Met3, Asp48, Pro87, Arg105, Ser118, Leu119, Gln157, Glu159, Ser190, Ser216, Arg221, Cys226, Ile246, Met253, and Ser285 were modeled as having dual conformations. Two peptides (His60–Asp63 and Thr177–Ser188, the WPD loop) and five solvent molecules were also modeled as having alternate conformations. The P-loop is in the wild-type conformation (Fig. 4), and extensive hydrogen bond interactions are present between the Asp215 carboxylate and the main chain and side chain nitrogens of Ser216, Ala217, Gly218, and Ser222, and the side chain oxygen of Ser222 as depicted schematically in Fig. 4A. Asp215 is also hydrogen-bonded to one of several ordered water molecules located in the binding site. This water is located at the position normally occupied by one of the phosphate oxygens of Tyr(P) in the Protein Data Bank 1PTY structure (Fig. 4B) and makes similar hydrogen bond interactions with the main chain nitrogens of Ile219 and Gly220. A second water molecule occupies the position of another phosphate oxygen, but appears to be quite mobile; and it has been modeled as having two distinct positions. This water molecule interacts with the main chain and ϵ-nitrogen of Arg222, the side chain oxygen of Asp215, and three water molecules. The other four solvent molecules, at least one of which appears to be quite delocalized, have been located in the binding site; together, these molecules form an extensive hydrogen bond network connecting Asp215 to Asp181 in the WPD loop (Fig. 4, A and B). The WPD loop assumes both conformations: the catalytically active closed conformation (preferred, with an average occupancy of 73.1% and an average temperature factor of 17.6 Å2) and the inactive open conformation typical of the unliganded enzyme. This alternate position refined to a much lower occupancy (26.9% on average, with an average temperature factor of 22.8 Å2), but electron density was clearly available in the difference Fourier maps that could be justified only by assuming a partially open loop. Following the two different positions of the WPD loop, the side chain of Arg221 also assumes two distinct conformations (with similar occupancies) that indeed correspond to the conformations previously observed in the apo- and liganded PTP-1B (Protein Data Bank codes 2HNP and 1PTY, respectively).Table IIIStatistics for the data set used to solve the structure of the apo-C215D mutant of PTP-1B and final statistics for the refined modelResolution range (Å)28.0-1.6 (1.7-1.6)No. of reflections62,681 (9061)% possible99.9 (100)Redundancy10 (9.5)I/σI11"
