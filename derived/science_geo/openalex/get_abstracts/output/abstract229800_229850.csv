Countless large items of plastic debris are accumulating in marine habitats worldwide and may persist for centuries ([ 1 ][1]–[ 4 ][2]). Here we show that microscopic plastic fragments and fibers ([Fig. 1A][3]) are also widespread in the
https://openalex.org/W2100990361,"There are 481 segments longer than 200 base pairs (bp) that are absolutely conserved (100% identity with no insertions or deletions) between orthologous regions of the human, rat, and mouse genomes. Nearly all of these segments are also conserved in the chicken and dog genomes, with an average of 95 and 99% identity, respectively. Many are also significantly conserved in fish. These ultraconserved elements of the human genome are most often located either overlapping exons in genes involved in RNA processing or in introns or nearby genes involved in the regulation of transcription and development. Along with more than 5000 sequences of over 100 bp that are absolutely conserved among the three sequenced mammals, these represent a class of genetic elements whose functions and evolutionary origins are yet to be determined, but which are more highly conserved between these species than are proteins and appear to be essential for the ontogeny of mammals and other vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2149388384,"Caspases play a central role in apoptosis, a well-studied pathway of programmed cell death. Other programs of death potentially involving necrosis and autophagy may exist, but their relation to apoptosis and mechanisms of regulation remains unclear. We define a new molecular pathway in which activation of the receptor-interacting protein (a serine-threonine kinase) and Jun amino-terminal kinase induced cell death with the morphology of autophagy. Autophagic death required the genes ATG7 and beclin 1 and was induced by caspase-8 inhibition. Clinical therapies involving caspase inhibitors may arrest apoptosis but also have the unanticipated effect of promoting autophagic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2157468016,"Although the molecular, cellular, and systems mechanisms required for initial memory processing have been intensively investigated, those underlying permanent memory storage remain elusive. We present neuroanatomical, pharmacological, and genetic results demonstrating that the anterior cingulate cortex plays a critical role in remote memory for contextual fear conditioning. Imaging of activity-dependent genes shows that the anterior cingulate is activated by remote memory and that this activation is impaired by a null alpha-CaMKII mutation that blocks remote memory. Accordingly, reversible inactivation of this structure in normal mice disrupts remote memory without affecting recent memory."
https://openalex.org/W2170969968,"Serotonergic dysregulation within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders, but the precise role of serotonin within the PFC is poorly understood. Using a serial discrimination reversal paradigm, we showed that upon reversal, selective serotonin depletion of the marmoset PFC produced perseverative responding to the previously rewarded stimulus without any significant effects on either retention of a discrimination learned preoperatively or acquisition of a novel discrimination postoperatively. These results highlight the importance of prefrontal serotonin in behavioral flexibility and are highly relevant to obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and the cognitive sequelae of drug abuse in which perseveration is prominent."
https://openalex.org/W2110107835,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a crucial mediator of inflammatory pain sensitization. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of a specific glycine receptor subtype (GlyR alpha3) by PGE2-induced receptor phosphorylation underlies central inflammatory pain sensitization. We show that GlyR alpha3 is distinctly expressed in superficial layers of the spinal cord dorsal horn. Mice deficient in GlyR alpha3 not only lack the inhibition of glycinergic neurotransmission by PGE2 seen in wild-type mice but also show a reduction in pain sensitization induced by spinal PGE2 injection or peripheral inflammation. Thus, GlyR alpha3 may provide a previously unrecognized molecular target in pain therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2013185153,"We studied the free fluid-fluid interface in a phase-separated colloid-polymer dispersion with laser scanning confocal microscopy and directly observed thermally induced capillary waves at the interface in real space. Experimental results for static and dynamic correlation functions validate the capillary wave model down to almost the particle level. The ultralow interfacial tension, the capillary length, and the capillary time are found to be in agreement with independent measurements. Furthermore, we show that capillary waves induce the spontaneous breakup of thin liquid films and thus are of key importance in the process of droplet coalescence."
https://openalex.org/W1970713347,"Copper active sites play a major role in enzymatic activation of dioxygen. We trapped the copper-dioxygen complex in the enzyme peptidylglycine-alphahydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) by freezing protein crystals that had been soaked with a slow substrate and ascorbate in the presence of oxygen. The x-ray crystal structure of this precatalytic complex, determined to 1.85-angstrom resolution, shows that oxygen binds to one of the coppers in the enzyme with an end-on geometry. Given this structure, it is likely that dioxygen is directly involved in the electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction steps of the PHM reaction. These insights may apply to other copper oxygen-activating enzymes, such as dopamine beta-monooxygenase, and to the design of biomimetic complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2030545022,"Over 99% of modern animals are members of the evolutionary lineage Bilateria. The evolutionary success of Bilateria is credited partly to the origin of bilateral symmetry. Although animals of the phylum Cnidaria are not within the Bilateria, some representatives, such as the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis , exhibit bilateral symmetry. We show that Nematostella uses homologous genes to achieve bilateral symmetry: Multiple Hox genes are expressed in a staggered fashion along its primary body axis, and the transforming growth factor–β gene decapentaplegic ( dpp ) is expressed in an asymmetric fashion about its secondary body axis. These data suggest that bilateral symmetry arose before the evolutionary split of Cnidaria and Bilateria."
https://openalex.org/W2139837799,"Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is strongly up-regulated in wounded cutaneous tissue and promotes repair-associated angiogenesis. However, little is known about its role in lymphatic regeneration of the healing skin. We studied wound healing in transgenic mice that overexpress VEGF-A specifically in the epidermis and in wild-type mice in the absence or presence of inhibitors of VEGF-A signaling. Surprisingly, transgenic overexpression of VEGF-A in the skin promoted lymphangiogenesis at the wound healing site, whereas systemic blockade of VEGFR-2 prevented lymphatic vessel formation. Studies in cultured lymphatic endothelial cells revealed that VEGF-A induced expression of the alpha1 and alpha2 integrins, which promoted their in vitro tube formation and their haptotactic migration toward type I collagen. VEGF-A-induced lymphatic endothelial cord formation and haptotactic migration were suppressed by anti-alpha1 and anti-alpha2 integrin blocking antibodies, and systemic blockade of the alpha1 and alpha2 integrins inhibited VEGF-A-driven lymphangiogenesis in vivo. We propose that VEGF-A promotes lymphatic vasculature formation via activation of VEGFR-2 and that lineage-specific differences of integrin receptor expression contribute to the distinct dynamics of wound-associated angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2007539627,"Neurotrophins are secreted growth factors critical for the development and maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system. Neurotrophins activate two types of cell surface receptors, the Trk receptor tyrosine kinases and the shared p75 neurotrophin receptor. We have determined the 2.4 Å crystal structure of the prototypic neurotrophin, nerve growth factor (NGF), complexed with the extracellular domain of p75. Surprisingly, the complex is composed of an NGF homodimer asymmetrically bound to a single p75. p75 binds along the homodimeric interface of NGF, which disables NGF's symmetry-related second p75 binding site through an allosteric conformational change. Thus, neurotrophin signaling through p75 may occur by disassembly of p75 dimers and assembly of asymmetric 2:1 neurotrophin/p75 complexes, which could potentially engage a Trk receptor to form a trimolecular signaling complex."
https://openalex.org/W2153244109,"The causes of sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) are poorly understood. 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a PD mimetic, is widely used to model this neurodegenerative disorder in vitro and in vivo; however, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. We demonstrate here that 6-OHDA evoked endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which was characterized by an up-regulation in the expression of GRP78 and GADD153 (Chop), cleavage of procaspase-12, and phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 alpha in a human dopaminergic neuronal cell line (SH-SY5Y) and cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3beta) responds to ER stress, and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation. 6-OHDA significantly inhibited phosphorylation of GSK3beta at Ser9, whereas it induced hyperphosphorylation of Tyr216 with little effect on GSK3beta expression in SH-SY5Y cells and PC12 cells (a rat dopamine cell line), as well as CGNs. Furthermore, 6-OHDA decreased the expression of cyclin D1, a substrate of GSK3beta, and dephosphorylated Akt, the upstream signaling component of GSK3beta. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), an ER stress-responsive phosphatase, was involved in 6-OHDA-induced GSK3beta dephosphorylation (Ser9). Blocking GSK3beta activity by selective inhibitors (lithium, TDZD-8, and L803-mts) prevented 6-OHDA-induced cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), DNA fragmentations and cell death. With a tetracycline (Tet)-controlled TrkB inducible system, we demonstrated that activation of TrkB in SH-SY5Y cells alleviated 6-OHDA-induced GSK3beta dephosphorylation (Ser9) and ameliorated 6-OHDA neurotoxicity. TrkB activation also protected CGNs against 6-OHDA-induced damage. Although antioxidants also offered neuroprotection, they had little effect on 6-OHDA-induced GSK3beta activation. These results suggest that GSK3beta is a critical intermediate in pro-apoptotic signaling cascades that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, thus providing a potential target site amenable to pharmacological intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2038186927,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) has been shown to be essential for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, we have found that HBx causes the progression of liver cancer through down-expression of PTEN, known as a tumor suppressor gene (1). The prognosis for HCC depends mainly on the clinicopathological characteristic regarding invasion and metastasis. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 has been implicated as playing an important role in HCC invasion and metastasis. We previously reported that HBV infection increased the invasiveness of hepatocytes and HCC cells through the transcriptional activation of MMP-9 (2). The HBx was shown to activate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) signal cascade, which is essential for activation of transcription factors such as activating protein (AP)-1 and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. In this study, we show that the HBx protein stimulates the activities of the PI-3K-Akt/ protein kinase B (PKB) as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) in HBx-transfected cells. Furthermore, we have shown that enhanced expression of MMP-9 in HBx-transfected cells mediated by not only activation of AP-1 transcriptional activity through ERKs pathway but also activation of NF-kappaB transcriptional activity through PI-3K-AKT/PKB pathway, and was associated with the invasive potential. However, treatment with U0126 (known as the ERKs inhibitor) or wortmannin (known as the PI-3K inhibitor), but not SB203580 (known as the p38 MAPK inhibitor), markedly inhibited the expression of MMP-9 induced by HBx in HBx-transfected cells. Seemingly, the invasiveness of HBx-transfected cells was decreased by treating with U0126 or wortmannin, but not SB203580. These results clearly suggest that the HBx contributed to the transcriptional regulation of MMP-9 through the ERKs and PI-3K-AKT/PKB pathway, and increased an invasive potential of cells."
https://openalex.org/W2045547222,"A copper-nitrosyl intermediate forms during the catalytic cycle of nitrite reductase, the enzyme that mediates the committed step in bacterial denitrification. The crystal structure of a type 2 copper-nitrosyl complex of nitrite reductase reveals an unprecedented side-on binding mode in which the nitrogen and oxygen atoms are nearly equidistant from the copper cofactor. Comparison of this structure with a refined nitrite-bound crystal structure explains how coordination can change between copper-oxygen and copper-nitrogen during catalysis. The side-on copper-nitrosyl in nitrite reductase expands the possibilities for nitric oxide interactions in copper proteins such as superoxide dismutase and prions."
https://openalex.org/W2068125088,"Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the major component of green tea extracts and possesses antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor activity. Our study focused on validating the inhibition of the bacterial type II fatty acid synthesis system as a mechanism for the antibacterial effects of EGCG and related plant polyphenols. EGCG and the related tea catechins potently inhibited both the FabG and FabI reductase steps in the fatty acid elongation cycle with IC50 values between 5 and 15 μm. The presence of the galloyl moiety was essential for activity, and EGCG was a competitive inhibitor of FabI and a mixed type inhibitor of FabG demonstrating that EGCG interfered with cofactor binding in both enzymes. EGCG inhibited acetate incorporation into fatty acids in vivo, although it was much less potent than thiolactomycin, a validated fatty acid synthesis inhibitor, and overexpression of FabG, FabI, or both did not confer resistance. A panel of other plant polyphenols was screened for FabG/FabI inhibition and antibacterial activity. Most of these inhibited both reductase steps, possessed antibacterial activity, and inhibited cellular fatty acid synthesis. The ability of the plant secondary metabolites to interfere with the activity of multiple NAD(P)-dependent cellular processes must be taken into account when assessing the specificity of their effects.

The ability of the plant secondary metabolites to interfere with the activity of multiple NAD(P)-dependent cellular processes must be taken into account when assessing the specificity of their effects. Plants are renowned for containing compounds of medicinal interest, and there is a continuing debate over the clinical value and safety of herbal remedies (1De Smet P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 2046-2056Google Scholar). Botanical extracts include a large variety of low molecular weight secondary metabolites derived from isoprenoid, phenylpropanoid, or fatty acid/polyketide pathways. The rich diversity of these compounds is thought to arise from an evolutionary process driven by the acquisition of resistance to microbiological attack (2Dixon R.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 843-847Google Scholar). Plants and their natural enemies co-evolve (3Rausher M.D. Nature. 2001; 411: 857-864Google Scholar), so it is also expected that bacterial defenses have arisen to combat these agents. The majority of plant pathogens are Gram-negative bacteria, and consistent with the co-evolutionary hypothesis, Gram-positive bacteria are generally more susceptible to the plant secondary metabolites than Gram-negative bacteria (4Lewis K. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 247-254Google Scholar, 5Yam T.S. Shah S. Hamilton-Miller J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 152: 169-174Google Scholar). For example, most Gram-negative bacteria are refractory to plant secondary metabolites when tested in standard susceptibility tests producing MIC 1The abbreviations used are: MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; EGCG, (–)-epigallocatechin gallate; TLM, thiolactomycin; ACP, acyl carrier protein; FabB, β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I; FabH, β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III; FabG, β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase; FabI, trans-2-enoyl-ACP reductase; 3HC, 2,2′,4′-trihydroxychalcone. values in the range of 0.1–1 mg/ml. A primary underlying cause for the resistance of Gram-negative bacteria to a wide range of plant toxins is the existence of efflux pumps that prevent the intracellular accumulation of polyphenols (4Lewis K. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 247-254Google Scholar, 6Tegos G. Stermitz F.R. Lomovskaya O. Lewis K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3133-3141Google Scholar). Genetic elimination of these pumps can increase the efficacy of the plant metabolites by 1–2 orders of magnitude (6Tegos G. Stermitz F.R. Lomovskaya O. Lewis K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3133-3141Google Scholar). Green tea and the individual compounds purified from tea extracts are among the best known plant polyphenols and possess numerous biological activities (including antimicrobial activity) against a variety of organisms (7Hamilton-Miller J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2375-2377Google Scholar). The main components of a cup of green tea (200 ml) are the well characterized catechins consisting of (–)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (140 mg), (–)-epigallocatechin (65 mg), (–)-epicatechin gallate (28 mg), and (–)-epicatechin (17 mg) (8Yang C.S. Wang Z.Y. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 1038-1049Google Scholar). Avid tea drinkers consume several cups a day, and although the potency of the catechins is low, the large quantities of the polyphenols that are ingested make it reasonable to think that they have potential for antibacterial activity. An example is the correlation between the in vivo and in vitro susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori to green tea (9Yee Y.K. Koo M.W. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 14: 635-638Google Scholar, 10Mabe K. Yamada M. Oguni I. Takahashi T. Antimicrobiol. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1788-1791Google Scholar). There is a huge amount of literature on the biological and biochemical activities of green tea extracts and isolated compounds, but a unifying hypothesis that accounts for their biological activities has not emerged, and the underlying biochemical targets remain unidentified (8Yang C.S. Wang Z.Y. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 1038-1049Google Scholar, 11Adhami V.M. Ahmad N. Mukhtar H. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 2417S-2424SGoogle Scholar, 12Higdon J.V. Frei B. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 2003; 43: 89-143Google Scholar). For example, EGCG and related polyphenols inhibit the fungal and mammalian type I fatty-acid synthase system, most likely by interacting with their reductase and perhaps condensation subdomains (13Wang X. Tian W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1200-1206Google Scholar, 14Wang X. Song K.S. Guo Q.X. Tian W.X. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 2039-2047Google Scholar, 15Li B.H. Tian W.X. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 135: 85-91Google Scholar, 16Li X.C. Joshi A.S. el-Sohly H.N. Khan S.I. Jacob M.R. Zhang Z. Khan I.A. Ferreira D. Walker L.A. Broedel Jr., S.E. Raulli R.E. Cihlar R.L. J. Nat. Prod. 2002; 65: 1909-1914Google Scholar). Indeed, the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis is consistent with many biological effects of EGCG, and it is tempting to conclude that fatty acid synthesis is an important target for tea catechins and plant secondary metabolites. Bacterial fatty-acid synthase consists of multiple individual enzymes, each encoded by a separate gene (17Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R. Gross C.A. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 612-636Google Scholar, 18Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1155-1166Google Scholar), in contrast to the mammalian fatty-acid synthase, which is a homodimer of single multifunctional polypeptide derived from a single gene (19Smith S. Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 289-317Google Scholar). The difference between the bacterial and mammalian synthases has been exploited to establish fatty acid synthesis as a target for antibacterial drug discovery (20Heath R.J. White S.W. Rock C.O. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 467-497Google Scholar, 21Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 305-332Google Scholar). There are several naturally produced antibiotics, such as cerulenin (22Vance D.E. Goldberg I. Mitsuhashi O. Bloch K. Omura S. Nomura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 649-656Google Scholar), thiolactomycin (TLM) (23Hayashi T. Yamamoto O. Sasaki H. Okazaki H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1984; 37: 1456-1461Google Scholar), and CT2108A (24Laakso J.A. Raulli R. McElhaney-Feser G.E. Actor P. Underiner T.L. Hotovec B.J. Mocek U. Cihlar R.L. Broedel Jr., S.E. J. Nat. Prod. 2003; 66: 1041-1046Google Scholar), and synthetic molecules (such as isoniazid (25Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quémard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. de Lisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Google Scholar) and triclosan (26McMurray L.M. Oethinger M. Levy S. Nature. 1998; 394: 531-532Google Scholar, 27Heath R.J. Yu Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30321Google Scholar)), all of which specifically target this pathway. Some of these, such as cerulenin (28Omura S. Microbiol. Rev. 1976; 40: 681-697Google Scholar), inhibit both the type I and type II fatty-acid synthases, whereas others, such as thiolactomycin (23Hayashi T. Yamamoto O. Sasaki H. Okazaki H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1984; 37: 1456-1461Google Scholar), are selective for the bacterial type II system and are potentially useful therapeutics (29Miyakawa S. Suzuki K. Noto T. Harada Y. Okazaki H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1982; 35: 411-419Google Scholar). The goals of this study were to determine whether the tea catechins and related plant polyphenols were inhibitors of bacterial type II fatty-acid synthase and to determine whether this inhibition was related to their antibacterial properties. We find that EGCG is a potent inhibitor of both the β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG) and the trans-2-enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) components in the bacterial type II fatty-acid synthase system, a property that is common to a broad range of plant polyphenols. However, the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis was not the sole reason for the antibacterial activity of the tested compounds in the Escherichia coli model system. Materials—Amersham Biosciences supplied [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (60 μCi/μmol), [1-14C]acetate (54 μCi/μmol), and [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (52 μCi/μmol); Sigma supplied acetoacetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, ACP, NADPH, NADH, and chloramphenicol. The trans-2-octanoyl-N-acetylcysteamine was the generous gift of Rocco Gogliotti and John Domagala (Parke-Davis). His-tagged FabB, FabH, FabG, and FabI from E. coli were purified as described previously (30Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Google Scholar, 31Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest grade available. Green tea extract compounds, including EGCG, (–)-epigallocatechin, (–)-epicatechin gallate, (–)-epicatechin, (–)-gallocatechin gallate, (–)-gallocatechin, (–)-catechin gallate, (+)-catechin, propyl gallate, gallic acid, butein, isoliquirtigenin, resveratrol, piceatannol, fisetin, quercetin, rhein, and plumbagin were purchased from Sigma. Fustin, taxifolin, 2,2′,4′-trihydroxychalcone, and 7,3′,4′-trihydroxyisoflavone were purchased from Indofine Chemicals Co. The compounds were dissolved in Me2SO at 10 mm. Bacterial Strains—Strain ANS1 (metB1 relA1 spoT1 gyrA216 tolC::Tn10 λ– λR F–) cultured in Tryptone broth (1% Tryptone) was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (32Jackowski S. Zhang Y.-M. Price A.C. White S.W. Rock C.O. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1246-1252Google Scholar). Chemically defined M9 medium (33Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972Google Scholar) was used in the [14C]-acetate labeling experiments described below. ANS1 was constructed by P1-mediated transduction of the tolC::Tn10 element in strain EP1581 into strain UB1005 followed by selection for tetracycline resistance. The TolC-dependent type I secretion and multidrug efflux systems are defective in ASN1 (32Jackowski S. Zhang Y.-M. Price A.C. White S.W. Rock C.O. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1246-1252Google Scholar). Plasmid expressing fabG or fabI was constructed by moving the XbaI-BamHI fragment of the His-tagged version of either the fabG or fabI gene (34Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10996-11000Google Scholar), respectively, in pET15-b into pBluescript II KS(+). To select for the presence of both reductases, the pBluescript plasmid carrying the enoyl-ACP reductase gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum was modified to replace the AmpR gene with and KanR cassette (35Marrakchi H. DeWolf Jr., W.E. Quinn C. West J. Polizzi B.J. So C.Y. Holmes D.J. Reed S.L. Heath R.J. Payne D.J. Rock C.O. Wallis N.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1055-1062Google Scholar). The His-tagged versions were used to confirm expression using an anti-tag antibody. β-Ketoacyl-ACP Reductase (FabG) Assay—The disappearance of NADPH, the cofactor for FabG reaction, was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm as described previously (36Zhang Y.-M. Wu B. Zheng J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52935-52943Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 0.5 mm acetoacetyl-CoA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 4 μg of FabG protein, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a final volume of 300 μl. Test compounds were added to the reaction mixture at the concentrations indicated in the text and figure legends. The reaction was initiated by the addition of acetoacetyl-CoA. A decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm was recorded for 2 min. The initial rate was used to calculate the enzymatic activity. Reactions with Me2SO solvent alone were used as controls. Enoyl-ACP Reductase (FabI) Assay—Reduction of the trans-2-octanoyl-N-acetylcysteamine substrate analog was measured spectrophotometrically by following the utilization of NADH at 340 nm at 25 °C as described previously (30Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Google Scholar). Briefly, a standard reaction contained 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 μm trans-2-octanoyl-N-acetylcysteamine, 200 μm NADH, and 12 μg of FabI in a final volume of 300 μl. A decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was measured at 25 °C for the linear period of the assay (usually the first 1–2 min). Test compounds were added in the assay to the indicated concentrations as described in the text and figure legends. An equal volume of the solvent was used for the untreated control. β-Ketoacyl-ACP Synthase I (FabB) and III (FabH) Assay—The coupled assay of FabH as described previously (34Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10996-11000Google Scholar) contained 25 μm ACP, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 65 μm malonyl-CoA, 45 μm [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (specific activity, 60 μCi/μmol), 1 μg of purified FabD, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 20 ng of FabH protein in a final volume of 40 μl. The FabD protein was present to generate the malonyl-ACP substrate for the reaction. The ACP, β-mercaptoethanol, and buffer were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min to ensure the complete reduction of ACP. The reaction was initiated by the addition of FabH. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, 35 μl of the reaction mixture was removed and dispensed onto a paper filter disc (Whatman No. 3MM filter paper). The disc was washed successively with ice-cold 10, 5, and 1% trichloroacetic acid with 20 min for each wash and 20 ml of wash solution per disc. The filter discs were dried and counted for 14C isotope in 3 ml of scintillation fluid. The condensation assay for FabB was the same as described previously (37Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11956Google Scholar). Briefly, FabB assays contained 45 μm myristoyl-ACP, 50 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 52 μCi/μmol), 100 μm ACP, 1 μg of FabD, and 25 ng of FabB in a final volume of 20 μl. ACP was reduced by 0.3 mm dithiothreitol before the other reaction components were added. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.4 ml of the reducing reagent containing 0.1 m K2HPO4, 0.4 m KCl, 30% tetrahydrofuran, and 5 mg/ml NaBH4. The reaction contents were vigorously mixed after the addition of the reducing reagent and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min before being extracted into 0.4 ml of toluene. The 14C isotope in the upper phase was quantitated by scintillation counting. IC50 values were determined at a series of concentrations. A line was drawn between the points, and the IC50 was the interpolated concentration that gave 50% inhibition (see Fig. 1). Determination of the MIC—The MICs of the test compounds against E. coli strain ANS1 were determined by a broth microdilution method. ANS1 was grown to midlog phase in 1% Tryptone broth and then diluted 30,000-fold in the same medium. A 10-μl aliquot of the diluted cell suspension (3,000–5,000 colony-forming units) was used to inoculate each well of a 96-well plate (U-bottom with a low evaporation lid) containing 100 μl of Tryptone broth with the indicated concentration of inhibitors. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 20 h before being read with a Fusion™ universal microplate analyzer (Packard) at 600 nm. The absorbance was normalized to the solvent-treated control, which was considered to be 100%. [1-14C]Acetate Labeling—Strain ANS1 was grown to midlog phase in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.1% casamino acids, 0.4% glycerol, and 0.0005% thiamin. A 1-ml aliquot of cells was treated with the antimicrobial compounds for 10 min at the indicated concentrations as described in the figure legends. An equal volume of the solvent Me2SO was added to the untreated control. Cells were then labeled with 10 μCi of [1-14C]acetate for 1 h before being harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 100 μl of M9 medium. The total cellular lipids were extracted, and the incorporated 14C isotope in lipids in the chloroform phase was quantitated by scintillation counting. Results reflect duplicate experiments. Inhibition of FabG and FabI by Tea Catechins—The enzymes of the type II fatty-acid synthase were assayed for inhibition by EGCG, the major catechin of green tea (Fig. 1A). The elongation condensing enzyme (FabB) was refractory to EGCG inhibition, whereas FabH, the initiating condensing enzyme, was inhibited by EGCG with an IC50 of 40 μm. The most potently inhibited enzyme was FabG, the NADPH-dependent ketoreductase in the pathway, which exhibited an IC50 of 5 μm. FabI, the NADH-dependent enoyl reductase, was inhibited by EGCG with an IC50 of 15 μm. FabG was used as a model enzyme to determine the inhibitory potency of the other significant green tea catechins (Fig. 1B). EGCG was the most potent, but the other catechins, (–)-epicatechin gallate, (–)-gallocatechin gallate, and (–)-catechin gallate, all exhibited activity against FabG with IC50 values ranging from 5 to 15 μm. Similarly, the four compounds exhibited activity against FabI with IC50 values between 5 and 15 μm (Table I). Also, we found that the gallate substitution was critical for the inhibitory activity of the compounds (Table I). Removal of the galloyl moiety from any of the tea catechins resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity in vitro. The galloyl group itself has no significant inhibitory activity as shown by the lack of FabG and FabI inhibition by propyl gallate and gallic acid (Table I). These data establish that green tea catechins have significant inhibitory activity against the reductase enzymes of the bacterial type II fatty-acid synthase. Furthermore, the structure-activity relationship shows that the portion of the EGCG molecule required for inhibition is defined by the boxed area in Scheme 1.Table IInhibitory effects of green extract compounds on the activity of fatty acid synthetic enzymes (FabG and FabI) and bacterial growth Open table in a new tab Mechanism for Tea Catechin Inhibition of FabG and FabI— The kinetic mechanism for the inhibition of FabG and FabI was determined using EGCG as the model compound (Fig. 2). Both FabG (38Price A.C. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 417-428Google Scholar) and FabI (39Sivaraman S. Zwahlen J. Bell A.F. Hedstrom L. Tonge P.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4406-4413Google Scholar) have compulsory ordered mechanisms with the nucleotide cofactors as the leading substrates. This knowledge allowed us to design a kinetic analysis that would distinguish between the three possible outcomes; EGCG could bind to the free enzyme, the enzyme-substrate complex, or both to prevent catalysis. In the first case, the inhibition pattern with respect to the cofactor would be competitive; in the second, the inhibition pattern would be non-competitive; and in the third case, mixed-type inhibition would be observed (40Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press Ltd., London1995: 95-101Google Scholar). The inhibition of FabG by EGCG was mixed with respect to NADPH (Fig. 2A). Thus, EGCG binds to both the free enzyme to prevent the binding of the nucleotide cofactor and also to the FabG-NADPH complex to prevent the binding of the substrate. In contrast, EGCG was a competitive inhibitor of FabI with respect to NADH (Fig. 2B), meaning that EGCG interferes with activity by binding to the free enzyme and preventing the binding of NADH. These data illustrate that EGCG inhibits both enzymes by association with the nucleotide cofactor binding site, and with FabG, EGCG has the additional property of binding to the enzyme-cofactor complex. Antimicrobial Effect of EGCG—As reported previously (5Yam T.S. Shah S. Hamilton-Miller J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 152: 169-174Google Scholar, 7Hamilton-Miller J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2375-2377Google Scholar), EGCG has moderate antibacterial activity. Most Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to plant polyphenols; therefore we used our E. coli strain ANS1 (tolC) to eliminate the activity of a major class of multidrug efflux pumps (6Tegos G. Stermitz F.R. Lomovskaya O. Lewis K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3133-3141Google Scholar, 32Jackowski S. Zhang Y.-M. Price A.C. White S.W. Rock C.O. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1246-1252Google Scholar). Such tolC mutants are used routinely as a platform to investigate the mechanism of drug action (41Sulavik M.C. Houseweart C. Cramer C. Jiwani N. Murgolo N. Greene J. DiDomenico B. Shaw K.J. Miller G.H. Hare R. Shimer G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 1126-1136Google Scholar). In strain ANS1, EGCG had an MIC of 500 μm (Fig. 3A), although the parent wild-type strain UB1005 had the same MIC in this case. To evaluate whether the antibacterial properties of the catechins could be attributed to their effects on fatty acid synthesis, first we determined whether the compounds blocked the incorporation of acetate into membrane fatty acids (Fig. 3B). EGCG indeed attenuated fatty acid synthesis in vivo compared with the untreated control cells and cells treated with chloramphenicol, a protein synthesis inhibitor. However, the effect of EGCG was not nearly as great as the effect of TLM, an established inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis at the elongation condensing enzyme step (42Tsay J.-T. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 508-513Google Scholar, 43Price A.C. Choi K.H. Heath R.J. Li Z. Rock C.O. White S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6551-6559Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that EGCG inhibits fatty acid synthesis in vivo, although it is not as potent when present at double its MIC compared with a bona fide inhibitor added to the cells at the same relative concentration, suggesting that fatty acid synthesis may not be the sole pathway inhibited by EGCG. Overexpression of individual genes and the isolation of resistant mutants are powerful genetic tools for target validation in vivo. For example, FabB was unequivocally established as the critical in vivo target for TLM by demonstrating that overexpression of FabB increased the resistance to TLM and that a point mutation conferring resistance to the drug was localized to the fabB gene (32Jackowski S. Zhang Y.-M. Price A.C. White S.W. Rock C.O. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1246-1252Google Scholar, 42Tsay J.-T. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 508-513Google Scholar). Similarly, FabI was validated as the triclosan target through analyzing the effects of FabI overexpression and the isolation of resistant mutants in the fabI gene (26McMurray L.M. Oethinger M. Levy S. Nature. 1998; 394: 531-532Google Scholar, 27Heath R.J. Yu Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30321Google Scholar). Unfortunately, there are no known specific inhibitors against FabG to corroborate the function of our FabG expression plasmid, but the construct increases FabG expression, and like the FabB and FabI constructs with identical promoter elements is anticipated to shift the dose-response curve for an antibacterial compound that selectively targets FabG. Therefore, we examined the effect of the overexpression of FabG, FabI, or both on the MIC for EGCG in strain ANS1 (Fig. 3A). Unlike other drugs that primarily target lipid synthesis, none of these plasmids increased the resistance of strain ANS1 to EGCG. We also attempted to raise EGCG-resistant mutants using the techniques described previously to isolate mutants specifically resistant to TLM (32Jackowski S. Zhang Y.-M. Price A.C. White S.W. Rock C.O. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1246-1252Google Scholar) or triclosan (27Heath R.J. Yu Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30321Google Scholar). However, we were unable to obtain colonies resistant to 1 mm EGCG. These data do not support fatty acid synthesis as a primary target for the action of EGCG, and the inability to isolate specific mutants is consistent with the existence of multiple targets in vivo. FabG/FabI Inhibition by Other Plant Natural Products—To determine whether the inhibition of FabG and FabI was a property of other natural products with the biphenyl core structure diagramed in Scheme 1, we tested a panel of plant polyphenols (Table II). The MIC values were obtained using strain ANS1 to eliminate the effects of efflux pumps, and the MICs for a wild-type and tolC isogenic pair were reported previously (6Tegos G. Stermitz F.R. Lomovskaya O. Lewis K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3133-3141Google Scholar). Some of the natural products (such as coumestrol, rhein, and plumbagin) had potent antibacterial activity but were not significant inhibitors of either the FabG or FabI reductases. However, in general all of the tested natural products with the biphenyl chalcone nucleus inhibited both enzymes. Resveratrol, piceatannol, fustin, taxifolin, and 7,3′,4′-trihydroxyisoflavone were good inhibitors for FabG and FabI, but their MIC values were high, indicating only weak activity against any target in vivo.Table IIInhibitory effects of polyphenol compounds on the activity of fatty acid synthetic enzymes (FabG and FabI) and bacterial growth Open table in a new tab The remaining polyphenols with comparable reasonable MIC values (Table II) were further evaluated for their effects on fatty acid synthesis at 4 times their MICs. The inhibition of [14C]acetate incorporation by butein, 3HC, fisetin, and quercetin was between 20 and 50% in comparison to cells treated with Me2SO (Table II). The highest inhibition was observed with isoliquirtigenin, which reduced the [14C]acetate incorporation by about 75%. The FabG/FabI inhibitor with the lowest MIC against strain ANS1, 3HC, was selected for more detailed investigation to determine whether its antibacterial action could be linked to blocking fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 4). FabH was not inhibited by 3HC. FabB, FabG, and FabI were all inhibited by 3HC with IC50 values of 100, 25, and 40 μm, respectively (Fig. 4A). Thus, 3HC was less potent than EGCG in vitro. The MIC for 3HC was 6.25 μm, and the MIC was not shifted by the overexpression of either FabG or FabI (Fig. 4B). Finally, acetate incorporation studies showed that fatty acid synthesis was inhibited only at concentrations significantly higher than the MIC for the compound (Fig. 4C). Although like most of the other plant polyphenols, 3HC inhibited the reductase steps in fatty acid synthesis in vitro, these data establish that the most effective antibacterial examined in the screen did not primarily inhibit cell growth by blocking the type II fatty acid synthesis. Likewise, we examined the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis in vivo using four other analogs with MICs below 75 μm (Table II). Although all of the compounds inhibited acetate incorporation into cellular fatty acids, none were as potent as the TLM control. Thus, these polyphenols reduced fatty acid synthesis, but the extent of inhibition was not consistent with fatty acid synthesis as the primary target for their antibacterial activity.

https://openalex.org/W2024838211,"The largest flux of terrigenous organic carbon into the ocean occurs in dissolved form by way of rivers. The fate of this material is enigmatic; there are numerous reports of conservative behavior over continental shelves, but the only knowledge we have about removal is that it occurs on long unknown time scales in the deep ocean. To investigate the removal process, we evaluated terrigenous dissolved organic carbon concentration gradients in the Beaufort Gyre of the western Arctic Ocean, which allowed us to observe the carbon's slow degradation. Using isotopic tracers of water-mass age, we determined that terrigenous dissolved organic carbon is mineralized with a half-life of 7.1 ± 3.0 years, thus allowing only 21 to 32% of it to be exported to the North Atlantic Ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2058021996,"At a resting pulse rate the heart consumes almost twice-as much oxygen per gram tissue as the brain and more than 43 times more than resting skeletal muscle (1). Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cannot sustain anaerobic metabolism. Balancing oxygen demand with availability is crucial to cardiac function and survival, and regulated gene expression is a critical element of maintaining this balance. We investigated the role of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1alpha in maintaining this balance under normoxic conditions. Cardiac myocyte-specific HIF-1alpha gene deletion in the hearts of genetically engineered mice caused reductions in contractility, vascularization, high-energy phosphate content, and lactate production. This was accompanied by altered calcium flux and altered expression of genes involved in calcium handling, angiogenesis, and glucose metabolism. These findings support a central role for HIF-1alpha in coordinating energy availability and utilization in the heart and have implications for disease states in which cardiac oxygen delivery is impaired. Heart muscle requires a constant supply of oxygen. When oxygen supply does not match myocardial demand cardiac contractile dysfunction occurs, and prolongation of this mismatch leads to apoptosis and necrosis. Coordination of oxygen supply and myocardial demand involves immediate adaptations, such as coronary vasodilatation, and longer-term adaptations that include altered patterns of gene expression (2-4). How the expression of multiple genes is coordinated with oxygen availability in the heart and the impact of oxygen-dependent gene expression on cardiac function are insufficiently understood. Further elucidating these relationships may help clarify the molecular pathology of various cardiovascular disease states, including ischemic cardiomyopathy and myocardial hibernation (5, 6)."
https://openalex.org/W2035444466,"We show that coverage fluctuations on catalyst particles can drastically alter their macroscopic catalytic behavior. Scrutinizing the occurrence of kinetic bistabilities, it is demonstrated by molecular beam experiments on model catalysts that macroscopically observable bistabilities vanish completely with decreasing particle size, as previously predicted by theory. The effect is attributed to fluctuation-induced transitions between two kinetic reaction regimes, with a transition rate controlled by both particle size and surface defects. These results suggest that fluctuation-induced effects represent a general phenomenon affecting the reaction kinetics on nanostructured surfaces."

One such system controls the chemotactic signaling mechanism of Dictyostelium , where pulses of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) are generated with a periodicity of 7 minutes. We have observed spontaneous oscillations in activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK2 that occur in phase with peaks of cAMP, and we show that ERK2 modulates cAMP levels through the phosphodiesterase RegA. Computer modeling and simulations of the underlying circuit faithfully account for the ability of the cells to spontaneously generate periodic pulses during specific stages of development. Similar oscillatory processes may occur in cells of many different species."

The growing emergence of multiresistance of pathogenic bacteria to currently used antibiotics requires the development of new therapeutic compounds and the identification and exploitation of novel targets (1Walsh C. Nature. 2000; 406: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). The enzymes of the pathway for cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis that are essential for bacterial growth and specific to eubacteria constitute such a set of interesting potential targets that should be explored in detail. Indeed, peptidoglycan, the heteropolymeric mesh of the bacterial cell wall, plays a critical role in protecting bacteria against osmotic lysis. It is also responsible for the maintenance of a defined cell shape and is intimately involved in the cell division process (2Nanninga N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 110-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This implies the passage of the monomer unit from the cytoplasm to the periplasm through the hydrophobic environment of the membrane, a process involving the transfer of this hydrophilic unit onto a lipid carrier, undecaprenyl phosphate (C55-P) (3van Heijenoort J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 4Rogers H.J. Perkins H.R. Ward J.B. Microbial Cell Walls and Membranes. Chapman and Hall, London1980: 239-297Crossref Google Scholar). The first membrane step is the transfer of the phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide moiety onto C55-P, yielding C55-PP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (lipid I), a reaction catalyzed by the MraY enzyme (Scheme 1). Since this reaction consists of the translocation of a peptidoglycan precursor moiety from the cytoplasm to the membrane, the latter enzyme has been named MraY “translocase” (5Neuhaus F.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1971; 4: 297-303Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This reaction is reversible, but in vivo it is drawn by coupling to the subsequent reaction catalyzed by the MurG transferase (5Neuhaus F.C.

The latter model has been established with MraY proteins from Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and thus appears to be conserved in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Alignment of bacterial MraY sequences shows that the five cytoplasmic domains contain many highly conserved amino acid residues. The presence of the MraY translocase exclusively in bacteria, the fact that it is essential for viability (which has been demonstrated in E. coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10Boyle D.S.

MraY is inhibited by nonclinically used antibiotics such as tunicamycin, amphomycin, mureidomycin, liposidomycin, and muraymycin (12Bugg T.D. Brandish P.E. FEMS Microbiol.

The Bacillus subtilis mraY gene was amplified from strain 168 chromosome using BS1 and BS2 oligonucleotides as PCR primers (see Table I) and the Expand high fidelity polymerase system (Roche Applied Science). The PCR fragment was cut by BspLU11I and BglII and inserted into the pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences) and pET28b plasmid vectors (Novagen) opened by compatible sites NcoI and BamHI, generating plasmids pTrcYBS62 and pETYBS62, respectively. In these constructs, the mraY gene was expressed under control of a strong IPTG-inducible promoter, and the encoded MraY protein carried an N-terminal His6 extension. The same procedure was used to clone the mraY genes from E. coli, S. aureus, and Thermotoga maritima, using oligonucleotides EC1 and EC2, SA1 and SA2, and TM1 and TM2, respectively (Table I) and the chromosomal DNA of the concerned bacteria as a template. The resulting plasmids were named pETYEC121 and pTrcYEC121 for E. coli, pETYSA21 and pTrcYSA21 for S. aureus, and pETYTM85 and pTrcYTM85 for T. maritima. These different constructions were verified by DNA sequencing (MWG-Biotech).Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideSequenceaRestriction sites BspLU11I (ACATGT), NcoI (CCATGG), BglII (AGATCT), BspHI (TCATGA), and BamHI (GGATCC) that were introduced in oligonucleotide sequences are indicated in boldface type.

At an A600 of ∼0.7, IPTG was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation was continued for 16 h at 25 °C with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (8,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), washed in 100 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer containing 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm NaCl, 30% glycerol, and 1 mm MgCl2 (buffer A). Bacteria were broken by sonication (Bioblock Vibracell sonicator model 72412). The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL100 centrifuge. The pellet consisting of membranes and associated proteins (14 g wet weight, 1.2 g of proteins) was washed three times with buffer A and then subjected to solubilization by detergents as described below. Membrane vesicles containing the overexpressed MraY protein were resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A. DDM was added at a final concentration of 17.8 mm, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h under shaking. After centrifugation (200,000 × g, 30 min at 4 °C), a first supernatant (DM1) was recovered. The insoluble material was then subjected to a new cycle of solubilization in buffer A containing 21.5 mm DDM. Supernatant DM2 was recovered after centrifugation. Two further rounds of solubilization/centrifugation were performed in the same conditions (21.5 mm DDM), generating supernatants DM3 and DM4, respectively. A similar procedure was used for extraction with other detergents. In that case, two successive treatments were performed, and the final concentration of detergent was 68, 41, 32, and 27.3 mm for n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, CHAPS, Triton X-100, and N-lauroyl sarcosine, respectively. Solubilized membrane proteins were mixed and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) (15 mg of proteins/ml of resin) pre-equilibrated in buffer B (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 30% glycerol, 3.9 mm DDM, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). After incubation, the resin was transferred to an Econo-Pac chromatography column (Bio-Rad) and washed first with 5 column volumes of buffer B. Further washings and protein elution were performed with increasing concentrations of imidazole, from 5 to 300 mm, in buffer B. After assays for translocase activity and SDS-PAGE analysis, pure MraY protein-containing fractions were freed from imidazole and concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience) in 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 3.9 mm DDM. Protein concentrations were determined using the QuantiProBCA assay kit (Sigma) and bovine serum albumin as the standard and/or by quantitative amino acid analysis with a Hitachi model L8800 analyzer (ScienceTec) after hydrolysis of samples in 6 m HCl for 24 h at 105 °C. The reaction mixtures contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm MgCl2, 1 mm UDP-MurNAc, 20 mm ATP, 1.2 mm l-Ala (or 1 mm l-[14C]Ala), 1.2 mm each d-Glu, meso-A2pm, and d-Ala-d-Ala, and 200 units each of enzymes MurC, MurD, MurE, and MurF. After 2 h at 37 °C, the formation of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was followed by analytical HPLC on a column of Nucleosil 5C18 (250 × 4.6 mm; Alltech France) using elution with 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.3, at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min (28Flouret B. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A first purification of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide from the reaction mixtures was performed by gel filtration on a column of Sephadex G-25, as previously described (29Mengin-Lecreulx D. Flouret B. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing these products, as judged by absorbance at 262 nm or radioactivity measurement, were pooled and lyophilized. The purification was completed by HPLC on a column of Vydac 218TP1022 (250 × 22 mm; Touzart & Matignon) using elution with 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.3, at a flow rate of 7 ml/min. The purity of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was checked by analytical HPLC and spectral absorbance analysis, and quantitation was obtained by amino acid analysis of a sample after hydrolysis in 6 m HCl for 16 h at 95 °C. Standard MraY Assay—The assay was performed in a final volume of 10 μl containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm MgCl2, 1.1 mm C55-P, 250 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm UDP-MurNAc-[14C]pentapeptide (337 Bq), and 8.4 mm N-lauroyl sarcosine. The reaction was initiated by the addition of MraY enzyme, and the mixture was incubated for 25 min at 37 °C under shaking with a thermomixer (Eppendorf). For the determination of the Km values, the MraY activity was assayed as described above with various concentrations of one substrate (60 μm to 3.7 mm for UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, 70 μm to 1.1 mm for C55-P) while maintaining the other at a fixed value (1.1 mm for C55-P, 0.25 mm for UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide). Data were fitted to the equation v = VA/(K + A) using the MDFitt software developed by M. Desmadril (UMR 8619 CNRS, Orsay, France). Coupled Assay with MurG—The coupled MraY-MurG assay was carried out in a volume of 10 μl containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm MgCl2, 1.1 mm C55-P, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, 0.02 mm UDP-[14C]GlcNAc, 10% Me2SO, 0.6 μg of MurG, and 3.6 mm N-lauroyl sarcosine (or 1.95 mm DDM). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.2 μg of MraY, and the mixture was incubated for 25 min at 37 °C under shaking. In all cases, the reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 1 min, and the radiolabeled substrates (UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide or UDP-GlcNAc) and reaction products (C55-PP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (lipid I) or C55-PP-MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-GlcNAc (lipid II)) were separated by TLC on silica gel plates LK6D (Whatman) using 2-propanol/ammonium hydroxide/water (6:3:1; v/v/v) as a mobile phase. The radioactive spots were located and quantified with a radioactivity scanner (model Multi-Tracemaster LB285; EG&G Wallac/Berthold). One unit of MraY activity corresponds to 1 nmol of lipid I produced per min. An MraY standard assay (scaled up to 50 μl) was performed as described above, except that UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was unlabeled. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 6 m pyridinium acetate. Then 100 μl of 1-butanol were added, and the mixture was vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The aqueous and organic phases were recovered. The organic phase was evaporated and taken up in 2-propanol/methanol (1:1; v/v) while the aqueous phase was left intact. Both phases were analyzed by mass spectrometry. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded in the linear mode with delayed extraction on a PerSeptive Voyager-DE STR instrument (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. MraY—The samples were prepared according to Grüber et al. (30Grüber G. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Link T.A. Coskun Ü. Rizzo V.F. Betz C. Bailer S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); 0.5 μl of MraY preparation was deposited on the plate and allowed to dry. Subsequently, 0.5 μl of matrix solution (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) was applied to the dried sample and again allowed to dry. Spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode at an acceleration voltage of +25 kV and an extraction delay time of 300 ns. The MurC protein was used as an external calibrant. Lipid I and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide—One μl of matrix solution (10 mg/ml 6-aza-2-thiothymine in 20 mm diammonium citrate) was deposited on the plate, followed by 0.5 μl of sample (dissolved in 2-propanol/methanol (1:1; v/v) for lipid I and water for UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide). After evaporation of the solvents, spectra were recorded in the negative ion mode at an acceleration voltage of –20 kV and an extraction delay time of 100 ns. A mixture of UDP-MurNAc, UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu, and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was used as an external calibrant. The MraY translocase catalyzes the first membrane step of peptidoglycan synthesis, an essential step considered as a very promising target for the search of new antibacterial compounds. It has been clearly underexploited to date, most probably because of the refractory nature of this protein to overexpression and purification. Indeed, all previous attempts to overproduce to high levels the MraY translocase, to purify it, or at least to detect it by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were unsuccessful (31Mengin-Lecreulx D.

In fact, only a radiolabeled form of this protein has been detected to date using in vitro translation experiments (9Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Le Beller D. van Heijenoort J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 10Boyle D.S. Donachie W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6429-6432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently investigated the membrane topology of the E. coli MraY protein and showed that its expression as a fusion with β-lactamase was an advantage for its stability and/or production. A significant but moderate 30-fold increase of MraY activity was detected in cells in which the MraY-BlaM fusion was expressed (9Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Le Beller D. van Heijenoort J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and the solubilized fusion protein was subsequently used for the development of a high throughput screening assay based on fluorescence detection (17Stachyra T. Dini C. Ferrari P. Bouhss A. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Blanot D. Biton J. Le Beller D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A similar (28-fold) overproduction factor was reported by Brandish et al. (32Brandish P.E. Burnham M.K. Lonsdale J.T. Southgate R. Inukai M. Bugg T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7609-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) when the E. coli mraY gene was cloned in the expression vector pTrc99A. Why the levels of overexpression were in all cases so modest was unclear given the well documented strength of the promoters used. We thus decided to revisit this question by performing a complete set of experiments using mraY genes from various bacterial species, different plasmid vectors, and different host strains and conditions for expression. The mraY genes from E. coli, S. aureus, T. maritima, and B. subtilis were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pTrc99A and pET28b expression vectors. In all of these constructs, the mraY gene product was expressed with a His6 tag extension to allow its easy purification on Ni2+-NTA-agarose. Strain C43(DE3), which is particularly well adapted for high level expression of membrane proteins (33Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar), was chosen as the host strain, since the extent of MraY overexpression in that strain was systematically about 5-fold higher than that observed in the other E. coli strains tested (DH5α and BL21(DE3)). In the case of B. subtilis MraY, expression from pTrc99A and pET28b vectors resulted in 25- and 145-fold increased levels of translocase activity, respectively, when cells were grown and induced at 37 °C and 5- and 330-fold, respectively, when cells were first grown at 37 °C and then induced at 25 °C. Similar results were obtained with MraY from E. coli, S. aureus, and T. maritima (Table II). We therefore essentially used pET28b-derivative plasmids and induction at 25 °C in all subsequent experiments.Table IIExtent of MraY overexpression in different host strainsHost strainsOverexpression factoraOverexpression factors as compared to the levels of MraY activity detected in membranes of control cells without plasmid: 0.1, 0.21, and 0.19 units/mg of proteins for DH5α, BL21(DE3), and C43(DE3), respectively.B. subtilis MraYT. maritima MraYS. aureus MraYE. coli MraYpET28bpTrc99ApET28bpTrc99ApET28bpTrc99ApET28bpTrc99ADH5α819ND30ND14ND61BL21(DE3)62678ND56ND160NDC43(DE3)3345190ND287ND456NDa Overexpression factors as compared to the levels of MraY activity detected in membranes of control cells without plasmid: 0.1, 0.21, and 0.19 units/mg of proteins for DH5α, BL21(DE3), and C43(DE3), respectively. Open table in a new tab Small scale cultures (50 ml) were then performed to identify the best MraY candidate to purify (i.e. the one, among the aforementioned species, exhibiting the best compromise between overexpression level and enzyme stability during the extraction and purification steps). Membrane proteins of IPTG-induced and noninduced cells were solubilized with DDM and tested for MraY activity. Cells carrying the different mraY-overexpressing plasmids all contained a similar 100–500-fold increased level of MraY activity in membranes when induced with IPTG. At this step, however, no significant increase of a protein band that could correspond to MraY (calculated mass of about 36 kDa) was detected by SDS-PAGE analysis of the extracts (data not shown). Various detergents (N-lauroyl sarcosine, DDM, Triton X-100, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and CHAPS) were then tested for their efficiency to extract the MraY proteins from the membranes and to maintain them in an enzymatically active form (Table III). N-Lauroyl sarcosine and DDM appeared more efficient than the other detergents for MraY extraction. However, the ionic detergent N-lauroyl sarcosine did not allow a sufficient binding of MraY on Ni2+-NTA-agarose, the resin used for the final step of purification. Most of the MraY protein was eluted at very low concentrations of imidazole (5–20 mm) and was thus only poorly purified in these conditions. In the case of DDM, the affinity of MraY for the resin was much better, and the purification of a protein eluted at higher concentrations of imidazole, ranging from 20 to 300 mm, was observed. Since the protein yield and purification state appeared significantly higher in the case of the B. subtilis MraY protein coded by the pETYBS62 plasmid (N-terminal His6-tagged form), the latter was chosen for large scale purification and enzyme characterization experiments.Table IIIEfficiency of different detergents to extract various overexpressed MraY orthologs from E. coli membranesExtracted MraY activityMDDMn-Octyl-β-d-glucopyranosideCHAPSTriton X-100N-Lauroyl sarcosine1212121212%%%%%%%%%%%B. subtilis MraY100aThe total MraY activity in the membranes, taken as 100%, was 900, 525, 775, and 1320 units for cells overexpressing the MraY protein from B. subtilis, T. maritima, S. aureus, and E. coli, respectively.339311091318125044T. maritima MraY100156145307534174033S. aureus MraY1008504068628124145E. coli MraY10084730179825135338a The total MraY activity in the membranes, taken as 100%, was 900, 525, 775, and 1320 units for cells overexpressing the MraY protein from B. subtilis, T. maritima, S. aureus, and E. coli, respectively. Open table in a new tab Overproduction and Purification of B. subtilis MraY—The sequence of the B. subtilis mraY gene amplified from strain 168 and cloned into pETYBS62 plasmid showed some minor differences from that found in databases (Pasteur data base, available on the World Wide Web at genolist.pasteur.fr/SubtiList/); the sequence 589CGTGAT594 (coding for RD) repeatedly appeared as GCTCAT (coding for AH) in the products from several independent PCRs using high fidelity polymerase. The molecular mass calculated for the B. subtilis MraY protein was 36,568 Da, taking into account the N-terminal extension tag consisting in Met-Ser-His6. A 5-liter culture of E. coli C43DE3(pETYBS62) was induced with IPTG, and membranes were prepared and tested for MraY activity. As previously observed with 50-ml cultures, the specific activity in this crude membrane extract was about 300-fold higher than that detected in control cells carrying the pET28b vector (66 versus 0.2 units/mg of protein, respectively). The extraction of the MraY protein was achieved by four successive treatments of membranes with DDM: one with 17.8 mm DDM (extract DM1) followed by three with 21.5 mm DDM (extracts DM2–DM4). Table IV recapitulates the levels of MraY activity detected in these different extracts. The differential extraction with DDM allowed us to remove a large amount of proteins but only little of the MraY activity in DM1. About one-third of the total MraY activity was recovered in DM2, with a 20% increase in specific activity. Protein amo"
https://openalex.org/W2115914856,"Although the primary function of myoglobin (Mb) has been considered to be cellular O2 storage and supply, recent studies have shown that Mb in addition can act as NO oxidase. Here we report that Mb also significantly contributes to the attenuation of oxidative stress in cardiac muscle. In support of this hypothesis, we found that in isolated perfused hearts of Mb-deficient (myo-/-) mice oxidative challenge by intracoronary infused H2O2 (1-300 microM) or superoxide formed by 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphtoquinone (0.1-30 microM), respectively, depressed cardiac contractility to a greater extent than in wild-type (WT) hearts, e.g., up to [H2O2] = 10 microM there was a significant left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) decrease in myo-/- hearts only (90.4+/-4.2 vs. 98.1+/-0.7% of control, n=6, P<0.05). Likewise in an ischemia/reperfusion protocol, myo-/- hearts showed a delayed recovery of postischemic function as compared with WT controls (e.g., LVDP was 35.6+/-7.5 vs. 22.4+/-5.3 mmHg, respectively, after 10 min of reperfusion, P<0.05, n=8), which correlated well with an enhanced release of reactive oxygen species in myo-/- hearts as measured by online lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence [e.g. 465+/-87 relative light units (RLU) in myo-/- vs. 287+/-73 RLU in WT after 2.5 min of reperfusion, P<0.05, n=8]. (31)P NMR spectroscopy revealed concomitantly a more pronounced phosphocreatine overshoot during reperfusion in the knockout but only minute alterations in ATP and pHi. Our data show that lack of Mb leads to increased vulnerability of cardiac function to oxidative challenge either pharmacologically induced or endogenously generated. We propose that Mb is a key element influencing redox pathways in cardiac muscle to functionally and metabolically protect the heart from oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W1971804401,"Macrophages are resistant to constitutive apoptosis, but infectious stimuli can induce either microbial or host-mediated macrophage apoptosis. Phagocytosis and killing of opsonized pneumococci by macrophages are potent stimuli for host-mediated apoptosis, but the link between pneumococcal killing and apoptosis induction remains undefined. We now show phagocytosis of pneumococci by differentiated human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) results in up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and increased production of NO and reactive nitrogen species. NO accumulation in macrophages initiates an apoptotic program that involves NO-dependent mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, Mcl-1 down-regulation, and caspase activation and results in nuclear condensation and fragmentation. An inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition, bongkrekic acid, decreases pneumococcal-associated macrophage apoptosis. Conversely, inhibition of NO production using iNOS inhibitors decreases bacterial killing and shifts the cell death program from apoptosis to necrosis. Pneumolysin contributes to both NO production and apoptosis induction. After initial microbial killing, NO accumulation switches the macrophage phenotype from an activated cell to a cell susceptible to apoptosis. These results illustrate important roles for NO in the integration of host defense and regulation of inflammation in human macrophages."

These are the oldest fossils of modern-type hummingbirds, which had not previously been reported from the Old World.

They further suggest that bird–flower coevolution dates back to the early Oligocene and open another view on the origin of ornithophily in Old World plants."
https://openalex.org/W2119672041,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury, a clinical problem during cardiac surgery, involves worsened adenosine trisphosphate (ATP) generation and damage to the heart. We studied carbon monoxide (CO) pretreatment, proven valuable in rodents but not previously tested in large animals, for its effects on pig hearts subjected to cardiopulmonary bypass with cardioplegic arrest. Hearts of CO-treated pigs showed significantly higher ATP and phosphocreatine levels, less interstitial edema, and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and required fewer defibrillations after bypass. We conclude that treatment with CO improves the energy status, prevents edema formation and apoptosis, and facilitates recovery in a clinically relevant model of cardiopulmonary bypass surgery."

L-type calcium current, protein, and spontaneous contractile activity were absent in the bladder of SMACKO mice. K+ and carbachol (CCh)-induced contractions were reduced to 10-fold in detrusor muscles from SMACKO mice. The dihydropyridine isradipine inhibited K+- and CCh-induced contractions of muscles from CTR but had no effect in muscles from SMACKO mice. CCh-induced contraction was blocked by removing extracellular Ca2+ but was unaffected by the PLC inhibitor U73122 or depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin. In muscles from CTR and SMACKO mice, CCh-induced contraction was partially inhibited by the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632. These results show that the Cav1.2 Ca2+ channel is essential for normal bladder function. The Rho-kinase and Ca2+-release pathways cannot compensate the lack of the L-type Ca2+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W2138780723,"The accumulation of misfolded proteins in intracellular inclusions is a generic feature of neurodegenerative disorders. Although heavily ubiquitylated, the aggregated proteins are not degraded by the proteasomes. A possible reason for this phenomenon may be a modification of deposited proteins by transglutaminases forming gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine (GGEL) cross-links between distinct proteins. Here, we show that the frequency of GGEL cross-links is an order of magnitude higher in Alzheimer's brain cortex than in age-matched or younger controls. This difference is due to the accumulation of GGEL cross-links in ubiquitin-immunopositive protein particles present in both Alzheimer's brains and those from aged individuals. The highly cross-linked protein aggregates show immunoreactivity to antibodies against tau and neurofilament proteins, and partially also to alpha-synuclein, indicating that these structures are inherent in Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles and Lewy bodies. Using mass sequence analysis, we identified the same six pairs of peptide sequences cross-linked in both senile and Alzheimer's specimens: Gln31 and Gln190 of HSP27 protein are cross-linked with Lys29 and Lys48 of ubiquitin and HSP27 therefore may cross-link two (poly)ubiquitin chains. One lysine residue of parkin and one of alpha-synuclein were also found to be cross-linked. The data suggest that cross-linking of (poly)ubiquitin moieties via HSP27 may have a role in the stabilization of the intraneuronal protein aggregates by interference with the proteasomal elimination of unfolded proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2037460653,"Glu-Leu-Arg (“ELR”) CXC chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and melanoma growth stimulatory activity (MGSA) recruit neutrophils by binding and activating two receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. CXCR1 is specific, binding only IL-8 with nanomolar affinity, whereas CXCR2 is promiscuous, binding all ELRCXC chemokines with high affinity. Receptor signaling consists of two events: interactions between the ligand N-terminal loop (N-loop) and receptor N-terminal domain (N-domain) residues (site I), and between the ligand N-terminal ELR and the receptor juxtamembrane domain (J-domain) residues (site II). It is not known how these interactions mediate ligand affinity and selectivity, and whether binding at one site influences binding and function at the other. Sequence analysis and structure-function studies have suggested that the receptor N-domain plays an important role in ligand selectivity. Here, we report ligand-binding properties and structural characteristics of the CXCR1 N-domain in solution and in detergent micelles that mimic the native membrane environment. We find that IL-8 binds the N-domain with significantly higher affinity in micelles than in solution (∼1 μm versus ∼20 μm) and that MGSA does not bind the N-domain in solution but does in micelles with appreciable affinity (∼3 μm). We find that the N-domain is structured in micelles and that the entire N-domain interacts with the micelle in an extended fashion. We conclude that the micellar environment constrains the N-domain, and this conformational restraint influences its ligand-binding properties. Most importantly, our data suggest that for both ligands, site I interaction provides similar affinity and that differential coupling between site I and II interactions is responsible for the observed differences in affinity.

CXCR1 is specific, binding only IL-8 with nanomolar affinity, whereas CXCR2 is promiscuous, binding all ELRCXC chemokines with high affinity. Receptor signaling consists of two events: interactions between the ligand N-terminal loop (N-loop) and receptor N-terminal domain (N-domain) residues (site I), and between the ligand N-terminal ELR and the receptor juxtamembrane domain (J-domain) residues (site II). It is not known how these interactions mediate ligand affinity and selectivity, and whether binding at one site influences binding and function at the other. Sequence analysis and structure-function studies have suggested that the receptor N-domain plays an important role in ligand selectivity. Here, we report ligand-binding properties and structural characteristics of the CXCR1 N-domain in solution and in detergent micelles that mimic the native membrane environment. We find that IL-8 binds the N-domain with significantly higher affinity in micelles than in solution (∼1 μm versus ∼20 μm) and that MGSA does not bind the N-domain in solution but does in micelles with appreciable affinity (∼3 μm). We find that the N-domain is structured in micelles and that the entire N-domain interacts with the micelle in an extended fashion. We conclude that the micellar environment constrains the N-domain, and this conformational restraint influences its ligand-binding properties. Most importantly, our data suggest that for both ligands, site I interaction provides similar affinity and that differential coupling between site I and II interactions is responsible for the observed differences in affinity. Chemokines, or chemotactic cytokines, are small soluble proteins (70–120 residues) that play fundamental regulatory roles in native immunity, inflammation, and host defense against infection. Over 40 chemokines have been identified to date, and these can be classified as CC, CXC, C, or CX3C chemokines based on the position of conserved cysteines (1Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176PubMed Google Scholar). The CXC chemokines can be further classified as Glu-Leu-Arg (“ELR”) and “non-ELR”, based on the presence or absence of this motif before the first cysteine. Chemokines carry out their function by binding and activating receptors that belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CXCR1, CXC chemokine receptor 1; CXCR2, CXC chemokine receptor 2; IL-8, interleukin-8; MGSA, melanoma growth stimulatory activity; N-domain, N-terminal domain; CD, circular dichroism; hCXCR1, human CXCR1; rCXCR1, rabbit CXCR1; DPC, dodecylphosphocholine; NBS, N-bromosuccinimide; LIC, ligation-independent cloning.1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CXCR1, CXC chemokine receptor 1; CXCR2, CXC chemokine receptor 2; IL-8, interleukin-8; MGSA, melanoma growth stimulatory activity; N-domain, N-terminal domain; CD, circular dichroism; hCXCR1, human CXCR1; rCXCR1, rabbit CXCR1; DPC, dodecylphosphocholine; NBS, N-bromosuccinimide; LIC, ligation-independent cloning. superfamily. The “ELRCXC” chemokines bind two receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, on the neutrophil cell surface. Interleukin-8 (IL-8, also known as CXCL8) binds both neutrophil receptors with high affinity, whereas other ELRCXC chemokines, including melanoma growth stimulatory activity (MGSA, also known as CXCL1), bind only CXCR2 with high affinity (2Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 3Murphy P.M. Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 311-318PubMed Google Scholar). The chemokine-chemokine receptor system in general is intricately complex, with multiple ligands binding a single receptor and a single ligand binding multiple receptors within, and sometimes outside, the respective subfamily (4Locati M. Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 5Loetscher P. Clark-Lewis I. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 69: 881-884PubMed Google Scholar). The structural and thermodynamic basis for the differences seen in ligand binding affinities, receptor selectivities, activation, and downstream signaling of chemokine receptors is not known. Knowledge of ligand and receptor structures, of binding-induced structural and dynamic changes in the ligand and receptor, and of the energetic basis of the ligand-receptor interaction is thus essential to understand this differential affinity and selectivity. The structures of several chemokines, including ELRCXC chemokines such as IL-8 and MGSA, are known, and all adopt a common chemokine fold: a disordered N-terminal end, followed by a series of loops and turns (defined as the N-loop), three β-strands, and an overlying α-helix (6Clore G.M.

Chemokine receptors are classified following the chemokine convention as CCR, CXCR, XCR, and CX3CR based on the kind of chemokine(s) they bind (1Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 313-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Although there are over 40 chemokines, there are considerably fewer receptors (6 CXC, 10 CC, 1 XCR, and 1 CX3CR). The structures of chemokine receptors are not known; indeed, the only GPCR structure solved to date is that of bovine rhodopsin (13Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H.

Our studies are directed toward understanding the structural basis of the ligand selectivity and binding affinity of CXCR1 for IL-8 versus MGSA. Furthermore, the specificity of CXCR1 and the promiscuity of CXCR2, reflect the complexity seen on a broader level in the entire chemokine-receptor system. The structural basis of IL-8 and MGSA function has been extensively characterized using both site-specific mutagenesis and chimeric constructs (14Baly D.L. Horuk R. Yansura D.G. Simmons L.C.

These studies, and similar studies for other chemokines, show that the receptor signaling involves two distinct sites: interaction between the ligand N-terminal loop (N-loop) and the receptor N-terminal domain residues (site I) and between the ligand N-terminal and the receptor exoloop and transmembrane (J-domain) residues (site II; Fig. 1) (24Crump M.P.

How these interactions mediate ligand affinity, receptor selectivity, and receptor activation, and whether binding at one site influences binding/function at the other site are not known. IL-8 binds both CXCR1 and CXCR2 with high affinity (Kd 1–7 nm), whereas MGSA binds CXCR2 with high affinity (Kd 3–9nm) and CXCR1 with much lower affinity (Kd 350–530 nm) (19Lowman H.B. Slagle P.H.

IL-8 and MGSA have very similar biochemical properties, such as high pIs, similar ratios of positive to negative charges, and similar hydrophobic surface area. Single mutations, deletions, and domain-swapping studies in IL-8 and MGSA have identified ELR and the N-loop residues as being important for receptor binding and function. IL-8 and MGSA ELR mutants show poor binding and activity, and especially mutants in which arginine has been mutated bind with ∼1000-fold less affinity and are completely inactive (18Hesselgesser J.

On the other hand, mutations and domain-swapping studies indicate that the N-loop residues are involved in receptor binding and determine receptor specificity (CXCR1 versus CXCR2). These residues in IL-8 are responsible for high affinity binding to both receptors and in MGSA are responsible for high and low affinity binding to CXCR2 and CXCR1, respectively (19Lowman H.B. Slagle P.H. DeForge L.E. Wirth C.M. Gillece-Castro B.L. Bourell J.H. Fairbrother W.J. J. Biol.

Comparison of the IL-8 and MGSA structures shows significant conformational differences for the N-loop region, suggesting that the differences in this region could be responsible for the receptor specificity (8Fairbrother W.J. Reilly D. Colby T.J. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 252-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the differential binding of IL-8 and MGSA to CXCR1 is due not to differences in their biochemical properties but due to differences in specific residues or structural features of the two ligands. The NMR relaxation measurements for IL-8 have also shown that the N-loop residues are more dynamic than the core structure (28Grasberger B.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the basis of structure-function studies on IL-8, it had been proposed that the core of chemokine ligand acts as a scaffold to which the N-terminal ELR and the N-loop residues are tethered through disulfide bonds for optimal interaction with the receptors (17Clark-Lewis I.

The structural requirements of the receptor residues for binding and activation are less well understood than for the ligands. Studies to date indicate that specific residues from the receptor N-domain and the J-domain mediate binding and activation, but it is not clear how these interactions mediate affinity and receptor selectivity. Mutational studies have identified some of the CXCR1 and CXCR2 residues as being important for IL-8 binding, on the basis of decreased binding and receptor activity (31Hebert C.A. Chuntharapai A.

Sequence analysis of CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors shows that the N-domain is the least conserved and most variable; the N-domains show about 40% sequence identity as opposed to 78% identity between the entire receptors. The most direct evidence for the importance of the N-domain comes from the observation that IL-8 binds the receptor N-domains with appreciable affinity and inhibits IL-8 binding to the intact receptor (35Gayle R.B.

Understanding the structural characteristics and ligand-binding properties of the N-domain may therefore provide key insights into the structural and energetic basis of selectivity and affinity of the intact receptor. In this study, we have used fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to characterize the structural properties of the CXCR1 N-domain and to correlate these with the ligand specificity and affinity of CXCR1 for IL-8 versus MGSA. We find that the CXCR1 N-domain is structured in detergent micelles that mimic the membrane environment and binds both IL-8 and MGSA with similar affinity. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of the structural and thermodynamic basis of ligand binding affinity and selectivity. Design and Synthesis of N-domain Constructs—The rabbit CXCR1 (rCXCR1) receptor has been shown to bind human IL-8 with affinity and specificity similar to that of the human CXCR1 (hCXCR1 (35Gayle R.B.

The CXCR1 N-domain sequences are presented below in Sequence 1; residues identified as being important for ligand binding are in boldface. We initially screened various peptides representing fragments of both human and rabbit CXCR1 N-domains and found that the rabbit peptides were easier to synthesize and were more soluble. We have therefore used fragments of the rCXCR1 N-domain for our structural and binding studies. The entire N-domain was observed to be sparingly soluble in solution, and therefore we used two constructs, comprising 23 and 34 residues of the full-length N-domain. Both constructs lacked 10 amino acids on the N-terminal end, and these have been shown not essential for binding (39Attwood M.R. Borkakoti N. Bottomley G.A. Conway E.A. Cowan I. Fallowfield A.G. Handa B.K. Jones P.S. Keech E. Kirtland S.J. Williams G. Wilson F.X. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 1869-1874Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, the 34-mer construct contained 11 membrane proximal residues on the C terminus of the N-domain. The original sequence for the 34-mer has a cysteine that was mutated to serine (underlined in Sequence 2) to minimize complications due to disulfide bond formation. We also synthesized a scrambled 34-mer peptide for use as a negative control to ensure that the binding to the native sequence is specific. N-domain peptides were synthesized either in the peptide core laboratory, University of Texas Medical Branch, or at Biomedical Research Center, Vancouver, Canada. The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a C18 preparative column using a gradient of 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid, water, and acetonitrile, and masses were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Expression and Purification of Human IL-8 and MGSA—Wild-type human IL-8 was bacterially expressed as a fusion protein from plasmid vector pET32 Xa/LIC containing the IL-8 gene cloned at the ligation-independent cloning site (a kind gift from Dr. Patti Liwang, Texas A&M University). The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL(21)DE3pLysS cells (OneShot™ Chemically Competent E. coli cells, Invitrogen). Transformants were grown in LB media in the presence of ampicillin to an optimal A600 of 0.5 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-2-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were spun down and lysed by four freeze-thaw cycles followed by sonication. The supernatant containing the fusion protein was passed through a nickel-nitrilo-triacetic acid column (Sigma-Aldrich) and eluted using 250 mm imidazole. The eluate was dialyzed into cleavage buffer (20 mm phosphate, 50 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm calcium chloride, pH 7.4) and cleaved using Factor Xa (Novagen, EMD Biosciences, Madison, WI). The cleaved protein was purified using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography column and eluted by a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The fractions containing the protein were pooled, lyophilized, and stored at –20 °C until further use. Wild-type MGSA was cloned into the same vector (pET32 Xa/LIC) and was transformed, expressed, and purified as outlined above. Fluorescence Spectra in Solution and Micelles—All fluorescence spectra were measured on a Spex Fluoromax™ fluorometer, with excitation at 295 nm and emission measured from 310 to 400 nm at 23 °C in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm sodium chloride buffer. Receptor peptide was used at a concentration of 2–5 μm. Micelles were prepared by dissolving dodecylphosphocholine (DPC, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in buffer to a concentration of 50–100 mm. The critical micelle concentration for DPC was 1 mm. Ligand Binding Studies in Solution and in Micelles—A N-bromosuccinimide (NBS, Sigma-Aldrich) modification of the IL-8 tryptophan was carried out in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. NBS was added from a stock of 3 mm NBS to a solution of ∼150 μm IL-8 to a final concentration of ∼450 μm NBS. The modification reaction was allowed to proceed for 20–25 min and monitored by decrease in protein absorbance at 280 nm. NBS modification was not necessary in the case of MGSA, because there are no tryptophans in its sequence. For the ligand binding studies, individual samples containing NBS-modified IL-8 or MGSA in concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 μm were prepared, with or without a fixed concentration (2–5 μm) of N-domain peptide. Fluorescence spectra of the blank IL-8 or MGSA solutions were subtracted from those of the ligand solutions containing N-domain or scrambled peptide. All readings were corrected for inner filter effect, because NBS-modified IL-8 showed low but appreciable absorption at 295 nm. The ligand binding studies in micelles were carried out in a similar fashion, but using 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl buffer containing 50 mm DPC. The fluorescence intensity at 367 nm (for studies in buffer) and at 350 nm (for studies in DPC) was normalized and plotted against ligand concentration to obtain binding curves. All curves were normalized using SigmaPlot 8.0 software and fitted to a simple one-site binding equation using the non-linear least-squares fitting algorithm from Origin™ software, taking into account the amount of bound versus free ligand. Circular Dichroism Studies in Solution and Micelles—All CD spectra were collected on an AVIV 62DS CD spectrometer at 25 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm sodium chloride buffer. Samples of the receptor N-domain peptides were made in this buffer and filtered to remove impurities. Spectra were recorded from 250 to 190 nm as an average of three scans and smoothed to obtain the final data. Similar studies were carried out in the presence of 50 mm DPC. CD Studies in the Presence of Ligand—Ligand-N-domain mixtures in the molar ratio 1:1 (25 μm each) were prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm sodium chloride buffer. Secondary CD spectra of individual receptor N-domain and ligand solutions, and of the ligand-peptide mixtures, were recorded from 250 to 190 nm, in a 0.1-cm path-length cuvette. Tertiary CD spectra of the individual ligand and receptor solutions and of the mixtures were measured from 260 to 320 nm, in a 1-cm path-length cuvette. Predicted spectra were obtained by adding individual spectra of the N-domain and ligand. Raw ellipticities were plotted, because molar ellipticities cannot be accurately determined in the case of protein complexes and mixtures. Similar studies were also carried out in buffer containing 50 mm DPC. Binding of IL-8 and MGSA to CXCR1 N-domain in Solution—We have used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to investigate the binding of IL-8 and MGSA to the rCXCR1 23-mer and 34-mer N-domain fragments. Fig. 2 (A and B) shows the predicted and observed far-UV CD spectra of the complex. The predicted spectra are obtained by adding the individual raw spectra of free peptide and ligand. In the absence of ligand binding to the N-domain peptides, the observed spectra of the peptide-IL-8 mixtures should correspond to the predicted (additive) spectra derived from the individual components. The observed spectra are different from the predicted spectra indicating that both peptides bind IL-8 in buffer. In contrast, for MGSA, the predicted and observed CD spectra were completely superimposable indicating absence of any interaction (Fig. 2, C and D). Furthermore, near-UV CD (which yields information on the environment of tryptophan and tyrosine residues) was used to probe tertiary structural changes on binding of IL-8 to the N-domain. The predicted and observed tertiary CD spectra show significant differences in the 270- to 290-nm region (Fig. 2, E and F). This is the region of tyrosine absorption, and these data therefore indicate that tyrosines on the peptide and/or the ligand are involved in this binding process. Both near-UV and far-UV CD spectra are in agreement, suggesting that both the 23-mer and 34-mer N-domain fragments bind IL-8 but not MGSA in solution. Control experiments using the scrambled 34-mer peptide showed no binding to IL-8 even in the presence of excess IL-8 (data not shown). Binding of IL-8 and MGSA to CXCR1 N-domain in Micelles—In the intact receptor, the N-domain is proximal to the membrane surface. This environment could impose conformational constraint on the N-domain, which in turn could have effects on ligand binding affinity and/or the selectivity of the receptor. To study such effects, binding studies of the N-domain-ligand mixtures were carried out in the presence of DPC micelles. DPC micelles have been extensively used as mimics of the membrane environment in the characterization of membrane proteins. Unlike the binding st"

https://openalex.org/W2095112317,"In non-excitable cells, one major route for Ca2+ influx is through store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. These channels are activated by the emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores, and in some cell types, particularly of hemopoietic origin, store-operated influx occurs through Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels. However, little is known about the downstream consequences of CRAC channel activation. Here, we report that Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels stimulates arachidonic acid production, whereas Ca2+ release from the stores is ineffective even though the latter evokes a robust intracellular Ca2+ signal. We find that arachidonic acid released by Ca2+ entering through CRAC channels is used to synthesize the potent paracrine proinflammatory signal leukotriene C4 (LTC4). Both pharmacological inhibitors of CRAC channels and mitochondrial depolarization, which impairs CRAC channel activity, suppress arachidonic acid release and LTC4 secretion. Thus, arachidonic acid release is preferentially stimulated by elevated subplasmalemmal Ca2+ levels due to open CRAC channels, suggesting that the enzyme is located close to the CRAC channels. Our results also identify a novel role for CRAC channels, namely the activation of a downstream signal transduction pathway resulting in the secretion of LTC4.

In non-excitable cells, depletion of internal Ca2+ stores opens store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane, a process called capacitative or store-operated Ca2+ entry (1Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar, 2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). In several cell types, particularly blood cells, store emptying activates a Ca2+-selective, inwardly rectifying, non-voltage-gated Ca2+ current called ICRAC (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Despite considerable attention, neither the gating mechanism nor the molecular identity of these channels has been resolved. Two popular models for the activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry are the diffusible messenger hypothesis, in which a mobile messenger plays a central role in channel activation, and conformational-coupling, which involves a direct physical interaction between inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors on the stores and the Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane (3Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 4Venkatachalam K. Van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Molecular candidates for store-operated Ca2+ channels have been sought in the transient receptor potential (TRP) 1The abbreviations used are: TPR, transient receptor potential; CRAC, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+; PLA2, phospholipase A2; cPLA2, cytosolic PLA2; iPLA2, Ca2+-independent PLA2; SERCA, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump; LT, leukotriene; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate; RBL cells, rat basophilic leukemia cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ARC, arachidonate-regulated Ca2+-selective.1The abbreviations used are: TPR, transient receptor potential; CRAC, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+; PLA2, phospholipase A2; cPLA2, cytosolic PLA2; iPLA2, Ca2+-independent PLA2; SERCA, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump; LT, leukotriene; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate; RBL cells, rat basophilic leukemia cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ARC, arachidonate-regulated Ca2+-selective. superfamily, particularly among members of the canonical or TRPC subgroup. Although various TRPCs, as well as TRPV6, have been proposed to function as store-operated Ca2+ channels, there is as yet no widely accepted candidate (5Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar). The downstream consequences of CRAC channel activation are not clearly established. This reflects, at least in part, the fact that cells often express Ca2+ influx pathways in addition to store-operated Ca2+ entry (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 6Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar), and the relative contributions of the different Ca2+ entry pathways have not always been separated. However, in Jurkat T lymphocytes and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that receptor engagement or exposure to the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin, or dialysis with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or high levels of Ca2+ chelator, i.e. procedures that empty the internal stores, all activate ICRAC to similar extents, indicating that in these cell types ICRAC is the predominant electrogenic Ca2+ entry pathway (7Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar, 8Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells, Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels is required for T cell receptor-mediated activation of nuclear transcription factors that regulate the expression of cytokine genes central to the immune response (11Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 12Hoth M. Button D.C. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10607-10612Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In RBL-1 cells, a mast cell line, Ca2+ entry via ICRAC contributes to regulated exocytosis (13Artalejo A.R. Ellory J.C. Parekh A.B. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar). Another important form of secretion from mast cells is the release of leukotrienes (LTs), a family of important lipid-derived signals that mediate inflammatory and allergic reactions (14Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.-E. Lindgren J.-A. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). LT production is initiated by the addition of molecular oxygen to arachidonic acid, a process catalyzed by the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (15Hammarberg T. Radmark O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cytosolic Ca2+ is an important regulator of 5-lipoxygenase. It binds to the N-terminal C2-like domain of 5-lipoxygenase, and this is essential for translocation of the enzyme from the cytosol to the nucleus where it subsequently binds in close proximity to the integral membrane protein FLAP (5-lipoxygenase-activating protein) (15Hammarberg T. Radmark O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol.

Studies involving partially purified 5-lipoxygenase as well as cell homogenates have demonstrated that micromolar levels of Ca2+ activate the enzyme (15Hammarberg T. Radmark O.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Formation of LTs is limited by the availability of arachidonic acid (19Werz O. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm. Allergy. 2002; 1: 23-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In many cell types, release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids with an sn-2 arachidonyl chain by phospholipase A2 is the major source for LT production (20Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar). RBL-1 and mast cells express both Ca2+-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) as well as Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) (21Glover S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Gelg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15359-15367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 22Smani T. Zakharov S.I. Leno E. Csutora P. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11909-11915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether these enzymes contribute equally to LT formation or whether one type is preferentially involved. Here, we have determined the involvement of Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels in the regulation of arachidonic acid release and LTC4 production in mast cells. We demonstrate that Ca2+ entering through CRAC channels drives the release of arachidonic acid but that this is not mimicked by similar increases in cytosolic Ca2+ following Ca2+ release from the stores. Hence elevated subplasmalemmal Ca2+ levels that arise following the opening of CRAC channels are preferentially linked to arachidonic acid generation. We find that arachidonic acid released by Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels is metabolized by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway resulting in the secretion of LTC4. Importantly, mitochondrial depolarization, which impairs Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels, prevents both the release of arachidonic acid and subsequent LTC4 synthesis. We conclude that mitochondria, by regulating the extent of Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels, are crucial determinants of Ca2+-dependent arachidonic acid production and therefore of subsequent downstream events such as the secretion of the key paracrine inflammatory signal LTC4. Cell Culture—RBL-1 cells were bought from ATCC. Cells were cultured (37 °C, 5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin, as described previously (10Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 23Gilabert J.-A. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6401-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For patch clamp and Ca2+ imaging experiments, cells were passaged onto glass coverslips and used 24–48 h after plating. ICRAC Recordings—Patch clamp experiments were conducted in the tight seal, whole-cell configuration at room temperature (20–25 °C) as described previously (10Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 23Gilabert J.-A. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6401-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Sylgard-coated, fire-polished pipettes had d.c. resistance of 4.2–5.5 megohms when filled with standard internal solution that contained (in mm): cesium glutamate 145, NaCl 8, MgCl2 1, Mg-ATP 2, EGTA 0.1, HEPES 10, pH 7.2, with CsOH. A correction of +10 mV was applied for the subsequent liquid junction potential that arose from this glutamate-based internal solution. Extracellular solution contained (in mm): NaCl 145, KCl 2.8, CaCl2 10, MgCl2 2, CsCl 10, d-glucose 10, and HEPES 10, pH 7.4, with NaOH. ICRAC was measured by applying voltage ramps (–100 to +100 mV in 50 ms) at 0.5 Hz from a holding potential of 0 mV as described previously (10Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 23Gilabert J.-A. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6401-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Currents were filtered using an 8-pole Bessel filter at 2.5 kHz and digitized at 100 μs. Currents were normalized by dividing the amplitudes (measured from the voltage ramps at –80 mV) by the cell capacitance. Capacitative currents were compensated before each ramp by using the automatic compensation of the EPC 9-2 amplifier. All leak currents were subtracted by averaging three ramp currents obtained just before application of thapsigargin and then subtracting this from all subsequent currents. Ca2+ Imaging—Ca2+ imaging experiments were carried out at room temperature using the IMAGO CCD camera-based system from TILL Photonics as described previously (24Glitsch M.D. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6744-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Cells were alternately excited at 356 and 380 nm (20-ms exposures), and images were acquired every 2–3 s. Images were analyzed offline using IGOR Pro for Windows. Cells were loaded with Fura 2-AM (1 μm) for 40 min at room temperature in the dark and then washed three times in standard external solution of composition (in mm) NaCl 145, KCl 2.8, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 2, d-glucose 10, and HEPES 10, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Cells were left for 15 min to allow further deesterification. [Ca2+] was calculated using an in vivo type calibration obtained by patching the cells. The rate of Ca2+ influx was obtained by measuring the initial slope of the Ca2+ rise following readmission of Ca2+ to cells with depleted stores (24Glitsch M.D. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6744-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Lysates—Attached cells from 6-cm plastic dishes were washed twice with PBS (composition in mm: NaCl 137, KCl 2.7, Na2HPO4 8, KH2PO4 1) and lysed with PBS buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After thorough mixing by repeated pipetting, samples were incubated on ice for 10 min. Then the lysates were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants were collected and stored at –70 °C until used. Western Blotting—Total cell lysates (10 μg) were mixed with 5 μl of glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. After electroblotting to nitrocellulose membrane, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed with PBS three times and then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-5-lipoxygenase antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories and used at 1:3000 dilution. Then the membranes were washed with PBS again and incubated with 1:2000 dilution of peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the bands were detected by an ECL-plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). [3H]Arachidonic Acid Release—Attached cells grown in 6-cm plastic dishes (∼80% confluency) were prelabeled with 0.25 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to remove unincorporated [3H]arachidonic acid as described previously in RBL-1 cells (21Glover S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Gelg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15359-15367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin with 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was added for different times (as described under “Results”). Then radioactivity in the supernatant was measured. The amount of [3H]arachidonic acid released into the medium was expressed as a percentage of total uptake [3H]arachidonic acid uptake. Reverse Transcriptase PCR Determination of 5-Lipoxygenase Expression in RBL Cells—Total RNA was extracted from RBL cells by a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). A reverse transcriptase reaction was performed on 3 μg of extracted total RNA using the Superscript II Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following cDNA synthesis, PCR was then performed with primers specific for 5-lipoxygenase (forward, 5′-AAAGAACTGGAAACACGTCAGAAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-AACTGGTGTGTACAGGGGTCAGTT-3′, with expected product size of 515 bp). 28 cycles of PCR were performed, with each cycle consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed through an agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. LTC4 Measurements—Following stimulation of attached cells (grown in 6-cm plastic dishes) with thapsigargin, the supernatant was collected, and LTC4 levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). Briefly, in 50 μl of supernatant, leukotriene C4 acetylcholinetransferase tracer and leukotriene C4 antiserum were added to each enzyme immunoassay well. The plate was covered with plastic film and incubated for 18 h at room temperature. The wells were then emptied and rinsed five times with enzyme immunoassay washing buffer. 200 μl of Ellman's reagent, prepared fresh, was added to each well, and the plate was placed on an orbital shaker for 1.5 h in the dark. Plate absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 405 nm. Thapsigargin-evoked Ca2+ Influx but Not Ca2+ Release Stimulates Arachidonic Acid Production—In RBL-1 cells, the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin depletes internal Ca2+ stores and subsequently activates ICRAC. Fig. 1A shows a typical whole-cell patch clamp experiment in which a cell was dialyzed with a pipette solution containing weak intracellular Ca2+ buffer (0.1 mm EGTA). Following application of thapsigargin (2 μm), a delay of several seconds elapsed before ICRAC started to activate. The current developed slowly, taking 201 ± 54 s to reach steady state (6 cells). The current was identified as ICRAC from its I-V relationship (Fig. 1A, inset; very positive reversal potential, inward rectification and voltage-independent gating) and from the fact that removal of external Ca2+ abolished the current (data not shown). We also measured the rate and extent of the cytosolic Ca2+ increase to thapsigargin in cells preloaded with Fura 2 (Fig. 1B); the upper panel depicts RBL-1 cells loaded with Fura 2, and the lower panel shows typical Ca2+ responses obtained after stimulation with thapsigargin. In the absence of external Ca2+, thapsigargin triggered Ca2+ release from the internal stores, and the Ca2+ signal decayed back to prestimulation levels over several minutes (Fig. 1B, lower panel). In the presence of external Ca2+, however, the Ca2+ signal was sustained. Aggregate data are summarized in Fig. 1C. Although the Ca2+ signals in the absence and presence of external Ca2+ were similar within 2 min of thapsigargin exposure, by 4 min a small but significant difference became apparent (Fig. 1C) in that the Ca2+ signal was larger in the presence of external Ca2+. To probe the relationship between Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels and arachidonic acid production, we measured arachidonic acid release at different times after stimulation with thapsigargin in the presence of external Ca2+. The results are shown in Fig. 1D. A small amount of release was seen at 2 min, and this increased substantially after 4 min of stimulation. No increase in arachidonic acid release could be detected following stimulation with thapsigargin for 4 min in Ca2+-free solution (Fig. 1E), demonstrating that it is Ca2+ influx and not Ca2+ release from stores that stimulates arachidonic acid production. Ca2+-dependent release of arachidonic acid suggests a dominant role for cPLA2 in our experiments; this PLA2 isoform is activated by a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (25Gijon M.A. Leslie C.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 26Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and is expressed in RBL-1 cells (21Glover S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Gelg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15359-15367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). RBL-1 cells also express iPLA2, which can be activated by store depletion (22Smani T. Zakharov S.I. Leno E. Csutora P. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11909-11915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The finding that arachidonic acid release was suppressed by the removal of external Ca2+ suggests that the contribution of iPLA2 is minor under our conditions. To confirm this finding, we examined the effects of the relatively specific iPLA2 inhibitor bromoenol lactone. However, as reported previously, bromoenol lactone substantially reduced store-operated Ca2+ entry (22Smani T. Zakharov S.I. Leno E. Csutora P. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11909-11915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), thereby potentially interfering with cPLA2 activation. Hence agents such as bromoenol lactone could be problematic in distinguishing between the PLA2 isoforms in intact cells. Finally, because cytosolic Ca2+ was still elevated 4 min after thapsigargin application in Ca2+-free solution, and this was only a moderately smaller elevation than seen in the presence of external Ca2+ (Fig. 1C), it appears that the enzyme responsible for arachidonic acid release, likely cPLA2, is more responsive to subplasmalemmal microdomains of elevated Ca2+ that accompany the opening of CRAC channels than to global increases in cytosolic Ca2+, at least over this range of Ca2+. The CRAC Channel Inhibitors 2-Aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) and Gd3+ Block Thapsigargin-dependent Stimulation of Arachidonic Acid Release—We designed experiments to identify the nature of the Ca2+ entry pathway that drives arachidonic acid release. If Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels stimulates arachidonic acid release, then one would expect inhibitors of CRAC channels to suppress this release. We tested this by using the store-operated channel blockers 2-APB and Gd3+. Although neither of these tools is specific, they do block store-operated entry and CRAC channels in a variety of cell types (27Putney J.W. Mol. Interv. 2004; 1: 84-94Google Scholar). 20 μm 2-APB blocks ICRAC in RBL-1 cells (28Bakowski D. Glitsch M.D. Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and completely suppressed the Ca2+ entry signal evoked by thapsigargin (Fig. 2, A and B). 2-APB also prevented the ability of thapsigargin to release arachidonic acid (Fig. 2C). Similar findings were obtained with 10 μm Gd3+ (Fig. 2C). In addition to store-operated Ca2+ entry, some cell types express arachidonate-regulated Ca2+-selective (ARC) channels, which are gated by arachidonic acid through a mechanism that does not involve store emptying (29Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10174-10181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40088-40096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Two arguments suggest that under our experimental conditions, ARC channels make little contribution to the overall Ca2+ signal. First, after a Ca2+ plateau had been reached following readmission of external Ca2+ to thapsigargin-treated cells, application of 20 μm 2-APB inhibited the Ca2+ signal by 81 ± 11%. Although 2-APB inhibits CRAC channels, it has no effect on ARC channels (29Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10174-10181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Second, even modest Ca2+ entry through the store-operated pathway rapidly inhibits ARC channels through a mechanism involving calcineurin (30Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40088-40096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When store-operated entry is active, ARC channels are inhibited (30Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40088-40096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels stimulates arachidonic acid release. Mitochondrial Depolarization Impairs Ca2+ Entry through CRAC Channels and Prevents Arachidonic Acid Release—We and others have previously established that energized mitochondria are required to support Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels (11Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 12Hoth M. Button D.C. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6744-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Depolarization of mitochondria rapidly attenuates Ca2+ influx. This arises, at least in part, from impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering such that Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels can now feed back more effectively to curtail further Ca2+ influx. We examined the effects of mitochondrial depolarization on Ca2+ entry and subsequent arachidonic acid release. In these experiments, stores were depleted by exposing cells to thapsigargin in Ca2+-free solution for 8 min and then to antimycin A and oligomycin, rotenone and oligomycin, oligomycin alone, or Me2SO (solvent control) for a further 15 min in the continued presence of thapsigargin. Cell appearance did not seem to change much within this time frame (Fig. 3, A–C). However, the rate of Ca2+ entry, measured following readmission of external Ca2+, was significantly slower when mitochondria had been depolarized following exposure to antimycin A (inhibitor of complex III of the respiratory chain) and oligomycin (F0/F1 ATP synthase inhibitor) (Fig. 3, D and E). The rate of Ca2+ influx was also reduced, albeit to a slightly lesser extent, when rotenone (10 μm), an inhibitor of complex I of the respiratory chain, was used together with oligomycin instead of antimycin A (Fig. 3E). However, oligomycin alone was without effect (Figs. 3, D and E). These results are consistent with our previous reports (23Gilabert J.-A. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6401-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 24Glitsch M.D. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6744-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and those of others (11Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 12Hoth M. Button D.C. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10607-10612Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), in which mitochondrial depolarization impaired CRAC channel activity. Because mitochondrial depolarization impairs Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels, we investigated the consequences of this on Ca2+-dependent arachidonic acid release. As shown in Fig. 3F, mitochondrial depolarization by the combination of either antimycin A and oligomycin or rotenone and oligomycin suppressed the release of arachidonic acid by thapsigargin. Oligomycin alone was again without effect. In Ca2+-free solution, thapsigargin failed to evoke any detectable arachidonic acid release (Fig. 1E), and this remained the case in the presence of antimycin A and oligomycin. Taken together, these data suggest that functional mitochondria are required for Ca2+-dependent arachidonic acid production through their effects on maintaining CRAC channel activity. Ca2+ Entry through CRAC Channels Stimulates LTC4 Production, a Downstream Consequence of Arachidonic Acid Release—We next investigated whether the release of arachidonic acid by Ca2+ entering through CRAC channels was physiologically relevant. Biosynthesis of LTs, which are important components of the adaptive part of the immune response, depends on the availability of arachidonic acid. We therefore examined the relationship between Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels and LT production, focusing on the cysteinyl LT LTC4. LTC4 is a potent pro-inflammatory mediator that is secreted from cells and subsequently causes smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability, and recruitment of other immune cells to the site of inflammation (14Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.-E. Lindgren J.-A. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar, 19Werz O. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm. Allergy. 2002; 1: 23-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). As with other LTs, the initial step in the synthesis of LTC4 is mediated by the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme. Reverse transcriptase PCR studies revealed that 5-lipoxgenase was present in RBL-1 cells (Fig. 4A), and Western blotting confirmed protein expression (Fig. 4B). Stimulation with thapsigargin resulted in a time-dependent increase in LTC4 production (Fig. 4C). A 2-min exposure to thapsigargin resulted in a small increase in LTC4 synthesis; this increased substantially after 4 min but only slightly further after 8 min. This time course closely paralleled that for the Ca2+-dependent release of arachidonic acid (Fig. 1D). Over this time period, thapsigargin did not alter the amount of 5-lipoxygenase present (Fig. 4B), indicating that the increase in LTC4 synthesis did not arise from an increase in the level of enzyme expression. Importantly, all LTC4 production was suppressed when Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels was prevented by removing external Ca2+ (Fig. 4D). Maneuvers that impair Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels reduce the extent of arachidonic acid release (Fig. 2). If arachidonic acid released through this route is used for LTC4 synthesis, then interfering with CRAC channel activity should also interfere with LTC4 production. We therefore examined the effects of the CRAC channel blockers 2-APB and Gd3+, both of which inhibit arachidonic acid release, on LTC4 synthesis. As shown in Fig. 5A, these inhibitors suppressed LTC4 production following a 4-min stimulation with thapsigargin in the presence of external Ca2+. We also examined the effects of mitochondrial depolarization on LTC4 synthesis. Both antimycin A and rotenone (in combination with oligomycin) substantially reduced the production of LTC4 following stimulation with thapsigargin (Fig. 5C), whereas oligomycin pretreatment had no significant inhibitory effect. Collectively, these results indicate that Ca2+ entering through CRAC channels stimulates arachidonic acid release, which is then used for the synthesis and subsequent secretion of LTC4. Arachidonic acid has been reported to inhibit store-operated Ca2+ entry in some systems (31Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 32Luo D. Broad L.M. Bird G.St.J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 274: 31174-31178Google Scholar). This raises the possibility of an intriguing negative feedback mechanism where Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels releases arachidonic acid, which then suppresses further Ca2+ influx. Although we found that arachidonic acid can partially inhibit both ICRAC and thapsigargin-evoked Ca2+ influx in Fura 2-loaded cells by up to 70% (data not shown), this occurs only at relatively high concentrations (10–50 μm). As pointed out by Shuttleworth and colleagues (29Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10174-10181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), these levels exceed the critical micelle concentration and could reflect nonspecific effects on the physical properties or structural integrity of the plasma membrane. At physiologically relevant concentrations (1–5 μm; see Ref. 30Mignen O. Thompson J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40088-40096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), arachidonic acid has no inhibitory effect on Ca2+ entry in RBL-1 cells (data not shown). Importantly, 5-lipoxygenase is active in the presence of physiological levels of arachidonic acid (33Ueda N. Kaneko S. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7982-7986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence arachidonic acid can be metabolized to LTC4 at concentrations that do not affect CRAC channel activity. Conclusions—Our results offer new insight into the down-stream consequences of CRAC channel activation. First, we demonstrate that Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels results in the generation of the important signaling molecule, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid has numerous intracellular targets including stimulation of certain isoforms of protein kinase C and therefore can induce relatively long-lasting changes in cell function (34Khan W.A. Blobe G.C. Hannun Y.A. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Even transient activation of CRAC channels following a 4-min exposure to thapsigargin was sufficient to generate a significant increase in arachidonate levels. Hence Ca2+-dependent release of arachidonic acid, ostensibly via stimulation of cPLA2, might be one way whereby a brief pulse of Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels induces longer lasting downstream effects. Second, arachidonic acid release is activated by Ca2+ influx but not Ca2+ release from the stores, despite reasonably similar overall increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Therefore cPLA2 likely senses the spatial profile of the Ca2+ signal and is preferentially activated by the elevated subplasmalemmal Ca2+ concentration that arises upon the opening of CRAC channels. This is reminiscent of the tight coupling between store-operated Ca2+ entry and activation of adenylate cyclase (35Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 36Cooper D.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Third, our results establish the importance of mitochondrial regulation of CRAC channel activity in determining subsequent downstream events. Mitochondrial depolarization, which impairs Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels, suppressed both arachidonic acid release and the ensuing LTC4 secretion. Mitochondrial gating of CRAC channels therefore has important physiological consequences in that it dictates whether a key intracellular (arachidonic acid) and then paracrine (LTC4) signal is generated or not. Finally, in light of the fact that LTC4 is a very potent pro-inflammatory mediator and has been linked to asthma (37Hart P.H. Immunol Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), our results identify the CRAC channel as a rational therapeutic target for drugs aimed at treating such disorders. We are grateful to Prof. James W. Putney, Jr., for reading the paper."
https://openalex.org/W1972514933,"We have previously reported that hypoxia induces a pronounced inflammatory response in the mouse lung associated with elevated levels of specific chemokines. To further explore the mechanisms involved in lung inflammation, we exposed RAW 264.7 cells as well as mouse primary macrophages to hypoxia and analyzed chemokine gene expression. Among the genes examined, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) expression was prominently induced by hypoxia both at the mRNA and the protein level. When RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with a panel of plasmids harboring a luciferase marker gene under the control of wild-type or mutant variants of the MIP-2 gene promoter, a strong hypoxic induction of expression (9- to 17-fold) was observed. This induction was abolished by a mutation targeted to an NF-kappaB binding site in the MIP-2 promoter. Concordantly, specific NF-kappaB binding to the cognate sequence was enriched in nuclear extracts from hypoxic but not normoxic RAW 264.7 cells. The mechanism of MIP-2 gene induction by hypoxia was further characterized using inhibitors of signaling kinases. Inhibition of the p42/p44 and PI3 kinases but not p38 MAPK abolished the NF-kappaB-driven upregulation of MIP-2 gene expression by hypoxia. This attenuation of the NF-kappaB response to hypoxia did not involve decreased nuclear NF-kappaB abundance but correlated with diminished transactivation potential of the p65 subunit. Our results indicate that the hypoxic signal for induction of MIP-2 gene expression is implemented through enhanced NF-kappaB activity and transmitted along the p42/44 and PI3 kinase pathways."

A structure-activity relationship study of skin cell photosensitization by endogenous pyridinium derivatives (pyridinoline, desmosine, pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal, pyridoxal-5′-phosphate) and various synthetic hydroxypyridine isomers identified 3-hydroxypyridine and N-alkyl-3-hydroxypyridinium cation as minimum phototoxic chromophores sufficient to effect skin cell sensitization toward UVB and UVA, respectively. Photosensitization of cultured human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT) and fibroblasts (CF3) by endogenous and synthetic 3-hydroxypyridine derivatives led to a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation, cell cycle arrest in G2/M, and induction of apoptosis, all of which were reversible by thiol antioxidant intervention.

Exposure of unirradiated human skin cells to UVA-irradiated skin extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins inhibited cell proliferation and induced chromosomal DNA damage proportional to UV dose that was fully reversed in the presence of catalase. Type I photoreductive formation of ROS, superoxide, and H2O2 in particular with concomitant light-driven protein oxidation was identified as the key mechanism of ECM protein-sensitized phototoxicity. Based on our previous identification of the collagen-derived pyridinium cross-link pyridinoline as a candidate photosensitizer contained specifically in ECM proteins (17Wondrak G.T. Roberts M.J.

A photooxidative mechanism of skin cell UVA photosensitization by all endogenous pyridinium compounds containing the identified minimum chromophore was elucidated. In this study, we present evidence that 3-hydroxypyridine derivatives comprising a wide range of skin biomolecules, such as enzymatic collagen cross-links, B6 vitamers, and various advanced glycation end products, act as endogenous UVA photosensitizers.

Preparation of a Covalent Bovine Serum Albumin-Vitamin B6 Conjugate (Pyridoxylated BSA, BSA-B6)—BSA-B6 was synthesized by reductive coupling of pyridoxal with protein lysine residues based on NaCNBH3 reduction of the initially formed Schiff base as described earlier (19Schirch V. Hopkins S. Villar E. Angelaccio S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained BSA (350 mg), NaCNBH3 (58 mg), and pyridoxal (64 mg) in a total volume of 1.5 ml of 0.25 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The reaction proceeded at 37 °C in the dark overnight. The reaction was terminated by acidification, followed by neutralization and extensive dialysis against water at 4 °C for 48 h under light exclusion. After lyophilization, the protein adduct, called BSA-B6, was characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and fluorescence and UV spectroscopy. Irradiation with Solar Simulated Light (SSL) and UVA—A KW large area light source solar simulator, model 91293, from Oriel Corp.

The output was quantified using a dosimeter from International Light Inc. (Newburyport, MA), model IL1700, with an SED240 detector for UVB (range 265–310 nm, peak 285 nm) or a SED033 detector for UVA (range 315–390 nm, peak 365 nm) at a distance of 365 mm from the source, which was used for all experiments. At 365 mm from the source, SSL dose was 7.63 mJ cm–2 s–1 UVA and 0.40 mJ cm–2 s–1 UVB radiation. Using a UVB/C-blocking filter, the dose at 365 mm from the source was 5.39 mJ cm–2 s–1 UVA radiation with a residual UVB dose of 3.16 μJ cm–2 s–1.

Assay for Photosensitized Suppression of Skin Cell Proliferation— Cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/dish on 35-mm dishes. After 24 h, cells were washed, placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and exposed to the combined or isolated action of photodynamic test compound and irradiation (UVA or SSL). Following a 30-min incubation after irradiation, the exposure medium was removed and replaced with fresh culture medium. Cell number was determined 72 h later, and proliferation was compared with cells that received mock irradiation in HBSS.

To avoid direct photooxidation of the dye probe, cells were first treated with UV irradiation and sensitizer and then loaded with the indicator dye under light exclusion. Apoptosis Analysis—Induction of cell death was confirmed by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide (PI) dual staining of cells followed by flow cytometric analysis. Cells (200,000) were seeded on 35-mm dishes and received photosensitization 24 h later. Cells were harvested at various time points after treatment, and cell staining was performed using an apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer's specifications (APO-AF; Sigma). Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were seeded at 2 × 105/dish on 35-mm culture dishes (Sarstedt) and left overnight to attach. After irradiation in the presence or absence of test compound, cells were washed twice with HBSS, and fresh culture medium was added. After 24 or 48 h, cells were harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, and placed on ice. After the addition of 2 ml of 70% (v/v) ethanol, 30% (v/v) PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min on ice. The fixed cells were pelleted by centrifugation; resuspended in 800 μl of PBS, 100 μl of ribonuclease A (1 mg/ml PBS), and 100 μl of propidium iodide (400 μg/ml PBS); and incubated for 30 min in the dark at 37 °C. Cellular DNA content was determined by flow cytometry using the ModFit LT software, version 3.0 (Verity, Topsham, ME). p38 Mitogen-activated Protein (MAP) Kinase Western Analysis—One day before treatment, 200,000 cells were seeded on 35-mm dishes. Cells were washed twice 24 h later with HBSS, followed by the addition of 1 ml of HBSS and exposure to increasing doses of UVA (up to 9.9 J/cm2) in the absence or presence of 100 μm NE-3HP. After irradiation or mock treatment, cells were incubated for 30 min (37 °C, 5% CO2) and then washed with PBS, lysed in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 μl, 0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 10% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25% bromphenol blue), heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and placed on ice. Samples (23 μl, containing ∼45 μg of total protein as determined by the BCA assay) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by immediate transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Equal protein loading and transfer was examined by reversible Ponceau staining, and the membrane was then used for p38 immunostaining as published recently (22Bachelor M.A. Silvers A.L. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7092-7099Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Sensitization of Protein Photocross-linking and Peptide Photo-oxidation—Ribonuclease A (RNase A, 10 mg/ml PBS) was irradiated with solar simulated light (13.8 J/cm2 UVA and 0.72 J/cm2 UVB) in the absence or presence of various hydroxypyridine derivatives (500 μm each, 200-μl total reaction volume). Protein oligomerization as a result of sensitized photocross-linking was visualized by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining and densitometric analysis using an Eagle Eye digital camera (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Melittin (1 mg/ml PBS) was irradiated with solar simulated light (13.8 J/cm2 UVA and 0.72 J/cm2 UVB) in the absence or presence of various hydroxypyridine derivatives (500 μm each, 200-μl total reaction volume) followed by mass spectrometry. Spectroscopy—UV spectra were recorded using a Cary 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer from Varian, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Spectramax Gemini XS (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) 96-well microtiter plate reader. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry was performed using a Bruker Reflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Spectra were recorded in positive ion mode in linear configuration using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Statistical Analysis—The results are presented as means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. They were analyzed using the two-sided Student's t test (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). UVA-photosensitized Inhibition of Skin Cell Proliferation by the Pyridinium Compounds Pyridinoline, Pyridoxine, and Other B6 Vitamers, but Not Desmosine—In a recent study on the phototoxicity of dermal ECM proteins and their potential role in sensitized skin photodamage, we identified the collagen-derived pyridinium cross-link pyridinoline (PYD; see Fig. 1) as a photosensitizer of UVA-driven superoxide and H2O2 formation (17Wondrak G.T. Roberts M.J. Cervantes-Laurean D. Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 578-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To examine the structural requirements for pyridinoline phototoxicity, we measured the sensitized inhibition of proliferation in cultured human fibroblasts (CF3) after cells were exposed to UVA irradiation (3.3 J/cm2) in the presence or absence of 500 μm pyridinoline or desmosine (DES; see Fig. 1), a structurally related pyridinium cross-link extracted from elastin. As shown in Fig. 2A, neither pyridinoline nor desmosine displayed any significant dark toxicity. The selected UVA dose in the absence of compound inhibited cell proliferation by 20%. The combined action of pyridinoline and light caused a pronounced inhibition of cell proliferation (∼60%). A suppression of cell proliferation by almost 45% was observed, when unirradiated cells were exposed to 6 μm H2O2, an amount equal to the concentration formed upon UVA irradiation of 500 μm pyridinoline, as quantified in Fig. 2B. Consistent with photosensitized formation of H2O2 as the mechanism of inhibition of proliferation by UV-irradiated pyridinoline, complete suppression of photosensitization was achieved when the antioxidants catalase or d-penicillamine were added before irradiation, whereas no protection was achieved using the singlet oxygen quencher sodium azide. No photosensitization of ROS formation or inhibition of skin cell proliferation was observed when cells were irradiated in the presence of desmosine. Next, we tested pyridoxine (PN; see Fig. 1), another endogenous hydroxypyridine derivative and structural homologue of pyridinoline (23Daumer K.M. Khan A.U. Steinbeck M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34681-34692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), for photosensitization of H2O2 production and inhibition of skin cell proliferation. Pyridoxine was a sensitizer of UVA-driven H2O2 formation equally effective as pyridinoline (Fig. 2B), but sensitized suppression of fibroblast proliferation exceeded the effect of H2O2 formed during irradiation (Fig. 2B). In contrast to pyridinoline sensitization, catalase treatment only weakly reversed pyridoxine sensitization, which suggests a mechanism of pyridoxine phototoxicity operating in addition to sensitization of H2O2 formation. Among various antioxidants including superoxide dismutase, mannitol, and deferoxamine mesylate (data not shown), only penicillamine treatment effectively antagonized pyridoxine-photosensitization (Fig. 2A). 1O2 involvement in pyridoxine photosensitization was excluded based on the observation that the presence of the singlet oxygen quenchers NaN3 and DABCO (data not shown) during irradiation was not protective, and irradiation in deuterated PBS did not enhance photosensitization (data not shown). From these initial observations, we conclude that the hydroxypyridine derivatives pyridinoline and pyridoxine are UVA photosensitizers of light-driven ROS formation and that inhibition of skin cell proliferation in the case of pyridoxine depends only partially on ROS formation.Fig. 2Pyridinoline and pyridoxine as photosensitizers of UVA-induced inhibition of skin cell proliferation and ROS formation. A, human skin fibroblasts (CF3) were exposed to UVA irradiation (3.3 J/cm2) in the presence or absence of DES, PYD, or PN (500 μm each) followed by a 30-min postirradiation incubation. Additionally, mock-irradiated cells were exposed to H2O2 (6 μm). After this time, the cells were washed with HBSS, fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added, and cell number was determined 72 h later by cell counting. Proliferation was compared with untreated cells (C). Cell proliferation was also assessed, when the experiment was performed in the presence of catalase (CAT; 400 units/ml), d-penicillamine (P; 10 mm), or NaN3 (10 mm). B, test compounds in HBSS were exposed to UVA irradiation as described above but in the absence of cells. Formation of H2O2 was quantified in the absence or presence of catalase (CAT) as indicated under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the relative phototoxicity of hydroxypyridine derivatives, a comparative dose response for the sensitized inhibition of proliferation by increasing doses of the pyridine derivatives pyridinoline, desmosine, and the B6 vitamers pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxal (formulas given in Fig. 1) was established as shown in Fig. 3A. No dark toxicity was observed for up to 1 mm of any test compound (data not shown). UVA phototoxicity increased in the order pyridinoline < pyridoxine < pyridoxamine < pyridoxal. At a UVA dose of 3.3 J cm–2, the sensitizer concentration necessary to achieve 50% suppression of cell proliferation (IC50± S.D., n = 3) observed after light treatment alone (∼80% proliferation of unirradiated controls; data not shown), was calculated by extrapolation from proliferation-inhibition curves (shown in Fig. 3A) for pyridinoline (632 ± 53 μm), pyridoxine (104 ± 17 μm), pyridoxamine (32 ± 7 μm), and pyridoxal (5 ± 1 μm). At concentrations approximately 5 times the IC50 for suppression of proliferation, pronounced induction of skin cell apoptosis was observed after combined exposure to B6 vitamers and UVA irradiation as detected by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/PI staining followed by flow cytometric analysis. Photosensitization of cell kill was particularly pronounced with pyridoxal as shown in Fig. 3B, with ∼35% of gated cells in either early or late apoptosis/necrosis at 24 h after irradiation. This induction of cell death was suppressed when the sensitization was performed in the presence of the thiol-antioxidant and free radical scavenger penicillamine. As observed above in Fig. 2A, NaN3 did not show photoprotection, suggesting that singlet oxygen is not involved in pyridoxal-photosensitized induction of cellular apoptosis (data not shown). In human skin, B6 vitamers can occur in free 5′-phosphorylated or unphosphorylated form and can also be bound covalently to protein (24Coburn S.P. Slominski A. Mahuren J.D. Wortsman J. Hessle L. Millan J.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 292-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 3B, sensitization of UVA-induced skin cell apoptosis observed with pyridoxal-5′-phosphate was almost as potent as with unphosphorylated pyridoxal. To examine whether vitamin B6 retains phototoxicity upon covalent coupling with proteins, a simple model protein-vitamin B6 adduct was synthesized by reductive coupling between pyridoxal and ϵ-amino groups of protein lysine residues in bovine serum albumin (BSA) performed after initial Schiff base formation (19Schirch V. Hopkins S. Villar E. Angelaccio S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The covalent conjugate (BSA-B6, bearing pyridoxylated lysine residues as shown in Fig. 1) was characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A mass difference Δm (BSA-B6 – BSA; 66,965 – 65,849) of ∼1100 Da indicated the incorporation of approximately seven pyridoxine moieties per BSA molecule. No residual unmodified BSA or species of intermediate weight were detected in the mass spectrum of BSA-B6 (data not shown). The UV spectrum of the BSA-B6 conjugate exhibited a novel absorption maximum at 335 nm (Fig. 3C), and fluorescence excitation at 335 nm led to strong emission around 400 nm (Fig. 3D), consistent with B6-fluorophore incorporation into the protein. BSA-B6 was devoid of any dark toxicity, since exposure of skin fibroblasts to BSA-B6 (5 mg/ml PBS) in the absence of UVA irradiation did not inhibit proliferation as shown in Fig. 3E. In contrast, pronounced inhibition of cell proliferation resulted from exposure to the combined action of UVA and BSA-B6, which was not observed upon irradiation in the presence of unmodified or NaCNBH3-reduced BSA. Based on these data, we conclude that unphosphorylated or 5′-phosphorylated B6 vitamers are UVA photosensitizers and that protein-bound pyridoxine retains phototoxicity. Identification of the Minimum Phototoxic Chromophores Contained in Endogenous Hydroxypyridine Photosensitizers— In an attempt to identify the minimum chromophore responsible for the photosensitizer activity of the endogenous hydroxypyridine derivatives pyridinoline and B6 vitamers, the hydroxypyridine (HP) isomers 2-HP, 3-HP, and 4-HP and the N-alkyl-3-HP derivative and pyridinoline analogue (25Reiser K.M. Hennessy S.M. Last J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 926: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) NE-3HP (100 μm each; formulas given in Fig. 1) were tested for photosensitized suppression of HaCaT keratinocyte proliferation by low doses of UVA (see Fig. 4A). None of the test compounds exhibited significant dark toxicity, and 3 days after combined treatment with test compound and UVA, only NE-3HP strongly suppressed cell proliferation. Cell counts obtained from samples treated with light and NE-3HP were below seeding density, suggesting cell depletion by photosensitized induction of cell death. Induction of apoptosis by the combined action of NE-3HP and UVA was confirmed by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/PI staining and flow cytometric analysis performed over 24 h after cell treatment (Fig. 4B). Cells in early (annexin V+/PI–) and late (annexin V+/PI+) apoptosis were observed starting 6 h after treatment (data not shown), and 24 h later, almost all cells were in late apoptosis/necrosis. These changes were"
https://openalex.org/W1998232218,"The polyamines (spermine, putrescine, and spermidine) can have neurotoxic or neuroprotective properties in models of neurodegeneration. However, assessment in a model of hypoxia-ischemia (HI) has not been defined. Furthermore, the putative mechanisms of neuroprotection have not been elucidated. Therefore, the present study examined the effects of the polyamines in a rat pup model of HI and determined effects on key enzymes involved in inflammation, namely, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginase. In addition, effects on mitochondrial function were investigated. The polyamines or saline were administered i.p. at 10mg/kg/day for 6 days post-HI. Histological assessment 7 days post-HI revealed that only spermine significantly (P<0.01) reduced infarct size from 46.14 +/- 10.4 mm3 (HI + saline) to 4.9 +/- 2.7 mm3. NOS activity was significantly increased following spermine treatment in the left (ligated) hemisphere compared with nonintervention controls (P<0.01) and HI + saline (P<0.05). In contrast, spermine decreased arginase activity compared with HI + saline but was still significantly elevated in comparison to nonintervention controls (P<0.01). Assessment of mitochondrial function in the HI + saline group, revealed significant and extensive damage to complex-I (P<0.01) and IV (P<0.001) and loss of citrate synthase activity (P<0.05). No effect on complex II-III was observed. Spermine treatment significantly prevented all these effects. This study has therefore confirmed the neuroprotective effects of spermine in vivo. However, for the first time, we have shown that this effect may, in part, be due to increased NOS activity and preservation of mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W2012825006,"WW domain is a well known protein module that mediates protein to protein interactions by binding to proline-containing ligands. Based on the ligand predilections, the WW domains have been classified into four major groups. Group II and III WW domains have been reported to bind the proline-leucine and proline-arginine motifs, respectively. In the present study, using surface plasmon resonance technique we have shown that these WW domains have almost indistinguishable ligand preferences and kinetic properties. Hence, we propose that Group II and III WW domains should be joined together as one group (Group II/III). Unlike Group I and IV WW domains, Group II/III WW domains can bind simple polyprolines as well as the proline-leucine and proline-arginine motifs, and they possess two Xaa-proline (where Xaa is any amino acid) binding grooves similar to SH3 domains. Our work assigns Group II and III WW domains to a larger family of polyproline-binding modules and proteins, which includes SH3 domains and profilin. Because polyprolines belong to the most frequently found peptide motifs in several genomes, our study implies the versatile importance of Group II/III WW domains in signaling.

Because polyprolines belong to the most frequently found peptide motifs in several genomes, our study implies the versatile importance of Group II/III WW domains in signaling. The WW domain is composed of 30–40 amino acids and named after two tryptophan (W) residues that are highly conserved and spaced 20–22 amino acids apart (1Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Google Scholar, 2Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Google Scholar). The domain binds proline-rich or proline-containing ligands (3Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Google Scholar, 4Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Google Scholar, 5Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Google Scholar). WW domain-containing proteins have been shown to be involved in a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle control (Pin1/Ess1), ubiquitin ligation (Nedd4/Rsp5 and smurf1), and coactivation of transcription (YAP65) (reviewed in Refs. 2Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Google Scholar and 6Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). A few WW domain-containing proteins have been implicated, either directly or indirectly, in a variety of human diseases such as Liddle's syndrome of hypertension, Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease (7Faber P.W. Barnes G.T. Srinidhi J. Chen J. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1463-1474Google Scholar, 8Huang X. Poy F. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Sudol M. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct.

Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Google Scholar). FBP11 and WAC act as a component of the splicing factor (10Bedford M.T. Reed R. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Google Scholar, 11Xu G.M. Arnaout M.A. Genomics. 2002; 79: 87-94Google Scholar). FBP11, HYPB, and HYPC also bind Huntingtin, a protein responsible for Huntington's disease (7Faber P.W. Barnes G.T. Srinidhi J. Chen J. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1463-1474Google Scholar). Fe65 binds β-amyloid precursor protein, a precursor of β-amyloid peptide, which constitutes the extracellular neuritic plaques in Alzheimer disease (9Sudol M. Sliwa K. Russo T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 190-195Google Scholar, 12Selkoe D.J. Science. 1997; 275: 630-631Google Scholar). The WW domain of Fe65 binds the proline-rich region of Mena, a mammalian homologue of Drosophila melanogaster Ena, which has been identified in a specific screen for dominant mutations that alleviate the Abl phenotype (13Gertler F.B. Doctor J.S. Hoffmann F.M. Science. 1990; 248: 857-860Google Scholar, 14Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32877Google Scholar). Fe65 and β-amyloid precursor protein are involved in the reconstruction of actin cytoskeleton, which suggests the concerted action of these proteins with Mena and/or Abl (9Sudol M. Sliwa K. Russo T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 190-195Google Scholar, 15Sabo S.L. Ikin A.F. Buxbaum J.D. Greengard P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1403-1414Google Scholar). The WW domain of FBP30 has been reported to bind the Pro-Arg (PR) motif (10Bedford M.T. Reed R. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Google Scholar, 16Bedford M.T. Sarbassova D. Xu J. Leder P. Yaffe M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10359-10396Google Scholar). WW domains have been classified into four groups according to their ligand specificity: Group I recognizes Pro-Pro-Xaa-Tyr (PY motif); Group II recognizes Pro-Pro-Leu-Pro (PL motif); Group III recognizes proline-rich segments with Arg residues (PR motif); and Group IV recognizes Ser(P)/Thr(P)-Pro-(pS/pT-P motif) (2Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Google Scholar, 9Sudol M. Sliwa K. Russo T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 190-195Google Scholar). According to this classification, the WW domains of FBP11 and Fe65 have been assigned to Group II, whereas that of FBP30 has been assigned to Group III. The crystal structures of the Group I and IV WW domains complexed with their ligands have revealed a common structural basis to recognize the Pro-containing ligands; the XP groove, which is formed by two aromatic rings with nearly parallel alignment, plays a pivotal role in recognizing the Xaa-Pro segment in the ligands (17Zarrinpar A. Lim W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 611-613Google Scholar, 18Macias M.J. Wiesner S. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 30-37Google Scholar, 19Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Science STKE. 2003; 179: 1-10Google Scholar). In addition, Group I and IV WW domains have been shown to possess their respective characteristic ligand recognition sites, the Tyr-binding groove (Tyr groove), and the phosphate-binding patch (“p” patch), which contribute to the specific ligand recognition (20Kato Y. Ito M. Kawai K. Nagata K. Tanokura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10173-10177Google Scholar). However, the classification between the Group II and III WW domains has been nebulous. For instance, the WW domain of Fe65 has been classified as Group II in one report (14Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32877Google Scholar) but as Group III in another report (16Bedford M.T. Sarbassova D. Xu J. Leder P. Yaffe M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10359-10396Google Scholar). In addition, there are a few proposed ligand motifs that can also bind some of the WW domains in these classes: the PGR motif and polyprolines (7Faber P.W. Barnes G.T. Srinidhi J. Chen J. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1463-1474Google Scholar, 10Bedford M.T. Reed R. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Google Scholar, 21Komuro A.

To examine the functional classification of the Group II and III WW domains in detail, we have performed quantitative binding experiments using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). 1The abbreviations used are: SPR, surface plasmon resonance; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; PPII, polyproline type II. 1The abbreviations used are: SPR, surface plasmon resonance; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; PPII, polyproline type II. We also analyzed binding data generated by proteomic mapping of the WW domain (23Hu H. Columbus J. Zhang Y. Wu D. Lian L. Yang S. Goodwin J. Luczak C. Carter M. Chen L. James M. Davis R. Sudol M Rodwell J Herrero J.J. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 643-655Google Scholar). We found that the WW domains previously classified as Groups II and III showed very similar ligand preference and that they were able to bind each other's cognate ligands. We therefore propose that the Group II and III WW domains should be classified into one group, Group II/III. Moreover, we have performed molecular modeling and revealed that both the Group II and III WW domains commonly have a characteristic groove that is formed by two aromatic rings with nearly parallel alignment, very similar to the XP groove, on the ligand-binding surface. The importance of this characteristic second XP groove (which we named “XP2”) to recognize their ligands was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Our report redefines classification of WW domains and provides an explanation for the molecular mechanisms behind this new classification. Plasmid Construction—The DNAs encoding the WW domains of human Pin1 and Caenorhabditis elegans Y110A2AL.13 gene product (Y110) were synthesized and amplified by a modified PCR in which several synthetic oligonucleotides were used as the template for the first cycle. The DNA encoding the second WW domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rsp5 (Rsp5p(WW2)), human Fe65L2, and the first WW domain of mouse FBP30 (FBP30A) were amplified by PCR using their cDNAs as templates, which were kindly provided by Dr. H. Tanahashi and Dr. M. T. Bedford (16Bedford M.T. Sarbassova D. Xu J. Leder P. Yaffe M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10359-10396Google Scholar, 24Tanahashi H. Tabira T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2376-2383Google Scholar). The WW domains of HYPB, WAC, and Fe65 were inserted into pGEX-4T-2 vectors as described earlier by Hu et al. (23Hu H. Columbus J. Zhang Y. Wu D. Lian L. Yang S. Goodwin J. Luczak C. Carter M. Chen L. James M. Davis R. Sudol M Rodwell J Herrero J.J. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 643-655Google Scholar). Expression and Purification—All the GST fusion WW domains were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) or BL21(DE3)/pLysS (Novagen) at 37 °C and purified with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The GST tag was removed by thrombin (Sigma) digestion at 4 °C for the SPR analysis. The WW domains were separated from GST and thrombin by reverse phase chromatography with a Resource RPC 1-ml column (Amersham Biosciences) with a linear gradient of 1–40% acetonitrile (1 ml/min, 20 min) in 20 mm ammonium formate, pH 7.0. Their molecular masses were verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Voyager mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The samples used in the proteomic mapping were prepared as described (23Hu H. Columbus J. Zhang Y. Wu D. Lian L. Yang S. Goodwin J. Luczak C. Carter M. Chen L. James M. Davis R. Sudol M Rodwell J Herrero J.J. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 643-655Google Scholar). Proteomic Mapping—Purified GST fusions of human WW domains were plated on 96-well plates. Employing automated equipment, complete cross-affinity matrices were generated between GST-WW fusions and proline-rich peptides derived from the human proteome. Peptidestreptavidin/alkaline phosphatase reaction was used to monitor the relative strength of binding. Quality controls and checks were employed as previously described (23Hu H. Columbus J. Zhang Y. Wu D. Lian L. Yang S. Goodwin J. Luczak C. Carter M. Chen L. James M. Davis R. Sudol M Rodwell J Herrero J.J. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 643-655Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis for the SPR Analysis—Pro-containing ligand peptides were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis on a PSSM8 Peptide Synthesizer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Rink amide AM resin (Novabiochem) and Fmoc-amino acids with protected side chains were used (Novabiochem). For phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, Fmoc-Ser(PO(OBzl)OH)-OH and Fmoc-Thr(PO(OBzl)OH)-OH (Novabiochem) were used, respectively. Synthesized peptides were cleaved from the resin and deprotected in trifluoroacetate in the presence of scavengers (5% water, 5% thioanisole, 3% ethylmethylsulfide, 2.5% ethandithiol, 2% thiophenol) and were then purified by reverse phase chromatography with a column ODS-AP303 (4.6 × 250 mm; YMC, Kyoto, Japan). Their molecular masses were verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Voyager mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The amino acid sequences of the ligand peptides were GTPPPPYTVG (WBP1 peptide containing the PY motif), SPPAPPTPPPLPPP (formin peptide containing the PL motif, mouse), PPPPPPPPPPPPPP (14-meric polyproline called PP in the present paper), CGGGPPGPPPRGPPPR (WBP11 peptide containing the PR motif), GGVPRpTPV (Cdc25c peptide containing the pS/pT-P motif), and KGGPPApTPP (Myt1 peptide containing the pS/pT-P motif). SPR Binding Assay—We measured SPR using a BIAcore 2000 (Biacore). Each ligand peptide was immobilized on a flow cell of a sensor chip CM5 (Biacore) by the standard 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide method with a 1 mg/ml peptide solution dissolved in 25 mm NaHCO3. For reference SPR signals, 25 mm NaHCO3 was used instead of a peptide solution in the immobilization reaction. The remaining activated esters were inactivated with ethanolamine. The binding experiments were performed at 20 °C using the WW domains dissolved as analytes in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA. The flow cells were regenerated with 100 mm NaOH. The concentrations of the WW domains were determined based on the absorbance at 280 nm of the protein solutions. The dissociation constants (KD) were determined by Scatchard plot analysis (27Lemmon M.A. Ladbury J.E. Mandiyan V. Zhou M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31653-31658Google Scholar, 28Oda M. Furukawa K. Sarai A. Nakamura H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 288-292Google Scholar). First, the raw sensorgrams of a flow cell without an immobilized ligand peptide were subtracted from the raw sensorgrams of ligand-bound flow cells. Then RUeq/C values were plotted against the RUeq values, where RUeq was the SPR response under the equilibrium, and C is the millimolar concentration of the analyte. Plotted data were fit to the equation: RUeq/C = -1/KD × RUeq + A (a constant), to determine KD. All the R2 values for the fittings by linear functions were >0.91. The association and dissociation rate constants (kon and koff) were determined from the direct fitting method using BIAevaluation 2.1. Molecular Modeling—Homology modeling was carried out using Swiss-Model (29Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar), an automated protein-modeling server combining homology search, model building, and energy minimization. The crystal structures of Pin1 (Protein Data Bank code 1PIN), and dystrophin (Protein Data Bank code 1EG3) and the NMR structures of FBP28 (Protein Data Bank code 1E0L) and mNedd4(WW3) (Protein Data Bank code 1I5H) were used as the templates for modeling the WW domains of FBP11A, Fe65L2, and FBP30A. Molecular surfaces and electrostatic potentials were calculated and displayed using MOL-MOL (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Google Scholar). The Swiss PDB Viewer was used to draw the backbone model (29Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar). SPR Binding Assay—We performed quantitative binding experiments by SPR to evaluate the ligand specificity of several WW domains belonging to Groups I-IV. Examples of SPR assay and analysis are shown in Fig. 1, A and B. The polypeptide ligands used were WBP1, Formin, WBP11, and Cdc25c/Myt1, which contain the PY, PL, PR, and pS/pT-P motifs and are the typical ligands for Group I, II, III, and IV WW domains, respectively. In addition, 14-meric polyproline (called PP in the present paper) was used. Eleven different WW domains were used as binding probes: the WW domains of hYAP65, Rsp5p, and mNedd4 (previously classified as Group I); those of FBP11A and HYPB (previously Group II); that of FBP30A (previously Group III); and those of Pin1 and Y110 (previously Group IV) (20Kato Y. Ito M. Kawai K. Nagata K. Tanokura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10173-10177Google Scholar). The WW domains of WAC and Fe65L2 have never been experimentally classified before. None of the WW domains used in the present SPR analysis was in the form of the GST fusion. The GST fusion proteins have the propensity to form dimers because of the nature of the GST component. This activity could cause the problem of avidity in the measurements of SPR. Thus, the proteins we used in the present study were digested and separated from the GST before the measurement. SPR Binding Assay of WW Domains Previously Classified as Group I—Many proteins have multiple WW domains. In our SPR experiments, we used only individual WW domains from such multi-WW domain proteins. The first WW domain of hYAP65 (hYAP65 (WW1)), the second WW domain of Rsp5 (Rsp5p(WW2)), and the third WW domain of mNedd4 (mNedd4(WW3)) interacted most strongly with the WBP1 peptide that contained a PY motif, the consensus sequence for the Group I ligands, with KD values of 11–71 μm (Fig. 1C). These values are in good agreement with the KD values determined for Group I WW domains using various techniques including isothermal titration microcalorimetry (31Macias M.J. Hyvonen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Google Scholar, 32Linn H. Ermekova K.S. Rentschler S. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 531-537Google Scholar). Considering these results, the problem of avidity was well avoided in the present measurement system. The WW domains of hYAP65(WW1) and rsp5p(WW2) also bound to the formin peptide that contains a PL motif, a consensus sequence for the Group II ligands. However, their bindings to the formin peptide were 19 and 50 times weaker in KD than those to the WBP1 peptide. These data show that the WW domains of hYAP65(WW1), rsp5p(WW2), and mNedd4(WW3) bound highly specifically to the PY motif, the Group I ligand. None of the Group I WW domains bound to PP peptide. SPR Binding Assay of WW Domains Previously Classified as Group II—The binding preference to the PP peptide were shown for the WW domains of FBP11A, HYPB, WAC, Fe65, and Fe65L2 (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the PL and PR motifs exhibited similar binding strength to those WW domains. Thus, a broader range in binding specificity seems common for Group II WW domains. For the WW domain of FBP11A (Group II), it was quantitatively confirmed that the most preferable ligand was the formin peptide, the PL motif. The PP and WBP11 peptide (the PR motif) also bound to FBP11A with only 2.1 and 3.3 times larger KD values, respectively, than the PL motif. The WW domain of WAC proved to possess the Group II specificity because it bound to the PP peptide most effectively. In addition, its relative binding abilities to the other Group II and III ligands were similar, with at most 2.1 times larger KD values. As was the case with the WAC WW domain, the WW domains of HYPB, Fe65, and Fe65L2 bound most strongly to PP in our SPR experiments. The WW domains of WAC, Fe65 and Fe65L2 bound also to the PL and PR motif at most with 8.4 and 2.5 times larger KD values than to the PP peptide, respectively. On the other hand, the WW domain of HYPB showed preference to the PP peptide, to which HYPB bound 19 and 20 times more strongly than to the PL and PR motifs, respectively. It is noteworthy that the WW domain of HYPB bound to the PL and PR motifs with similar KD values. The similar binding strength to both the PL and PR motifs was also observed in the other Group II WW domains (FBP11A, WAC, Fe65, and Fe65L2) reported here, because the differences of KD values were at most only 4.1 times. The controversial group classification of Fe65 was clarified in the present report. Our results showed that Fe65 best preferred the PP peptide, the Group II ligand, but also bound to the PR motif, the Group III ligand, with the small difference of KD values (2.5 times). We should consider the PP peptide as one of the general ligand motifs for the WW domains because those of HYPB, Fe65, and Fe65L2 showed significantly stronger binding to PP than to the PL motif. SPR Binding Assay of WW Domains Previously Classified as Group III—The WW domain of FBP30A, a Group III WW domain, expectedly bound most strongly to the PR motif, the typical Group III ligand, and unexpectedly bound to the PL and PP motifs, the Group II ligands, to a considerable extent (Fig. 1C). FBP30A bound to the PP and formin peptide with only 3.3 and 8.0 times larger KD values, respectively, than to the WBP11 peptide. It was also found that FBP30A bound to the PL motif more strongly than FBP11A, a Group II WW domain. Our data on the Group II and III WW domains clearly indicate that Group II and III WW domains share their ligands, the PL, PR, and PP motifs, and that in all cases their ligand preferences are very similar or almost indistinguishable. SPR Binding Assay of WW Domains Previously Classified as Group IV—It is confirmed here that the Group IV WW domains bind specifically to peptides containing the pS/pT-P motif. The WW domains of Pin1 and Y110 were previously classified as Group IV (2Sudol M. Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1001-1004Google Scholar, 5Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Google Scholar, 20Kato Y. Ito M. Kawai K. Nagata K. Tanokura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10173-10177Google Scholar). In the present study we confirmed that WW domain of Pin1 and Y110 bound most strongly to the cognate peptides derived from the Cdc25c and Myt1 proteins (Fig. 1C). The WW domain of Pin1 interacted weakly with the WBP11 peptide, a Group III ligand, with a KD value of 1.13 mm, i.e. 44 times less strongly than with the Cdc25c peptide. Thus, the bindings of the Group IV WW domains were highly specific to the Group IV ligands. It should be noted that none of the Group IV WW domains bound to the PP motif. Kinetics of WW Domains Previously Classified as Group II or III—The kinetic parameters of the Group II and III showed the extremely large koff values, i.e. the fast dissociation (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, the Groups II and III WW domains share common nature not only in terms of the specificity of ligand recognition but also in the binding kinetics. The kinetic parameters of ligand binding were compared for WW domains from Groups II and III (Fig. 1D). All of these WW domains showed a common tendency in the rate constants for both association and dissociation; those WW domains associated faster with the PP motif than with the PL and the PR motifs and dissociated from the PL motif faster than from the PP and PR motifs. It is noteworthy that the WW domain of HYPB associated with the PP motif extremely fast, with the rate constant of 2.2 ± 1.3 × 105m-1 s-1. This relative speed of association must be one of the underlying features of its high specificity to the PP motif. Proteomic Mapping—We also performed the proteomic mapping assay for the selected WW domains examined above and confirmed the common ligand predilection of the Group II and III WW domains. From Table I, we can see that all three domains have much lower number of more strongly binding ligands (optical density, >2.5) from the PY-containing peptides of the Group I. The percentage of more strongly binding ligands in Group I is in the range of 1–2%, whereas the percentages of more strongly binding ligands containing the PL, PP, and PR motifs are in the range of 5–8, 10–23, and 5–6%, respectively (Tables I and II). Thus, these three WW domains commonly prefer the PP motif best, the PL and PR motifs second best, and the PY motif worst. It is noteworthy that these WW domains prefer the PL (the Group II ligand) and PR (the Group III ligand) motifs to a similar extent. The data indicate that the difference in ligand preference of these three WW domains is almost indistinguishable. These results are consistent with the data from the SPR assay as described above.Table IThe binding distribution of three WW domains among three groups of Pro-containing ligands The binding profiles of three WW domains (from HYPB, WAC, and Fe65) are presented as the number (percentage) of one-group ligands that a given domain binds to in four optical density ranges. The total number of ligands tested against the given domain is also provided. The detailed background and methods used to acquire these data are as described (23Hu H. Columbus J. Zhang Y. Wu D. Lian L. Yang S. Goodwin J. Luczak C. Carter M. Chen L. James M. Davis R. Sudol M Rodwell J Herrero J.J. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 643-655Google Scholar). The ligands used in this analysis were generated by mining Swiss Prot human protein sequences with the core patterns (e.g. PPLP) through pattern matching. Specifically, a ligand is generated by matching the core pattern to a protein sequence and taking on average of 4 amino acids to both the N and C termini of the protein sequence as flanking region. The average ligand length is 12 amino acids. The criteria used to categorize a ligand into a group are for the core pattern (the PY, PL, PP, or PR motif) to be situated at least 2 amino acids from either end of a ligand. The examples of ligands used in this assay are listed in Table II. The sequences included in the respective motifs are described in the arcs. The domain numbers (D00188, D00189, and D00243) are internally generated identifiers.DomainsGroupLigand motifsTotal number of ligandsOptical density<0.50.5–1.51.5–2.5>2.5HYPB (D00188)IPY (PPXY)764648 (84.8%)84 (11.0%)16 (2.1%)16 (2.1%)IIPL (PPLP)445359 (80.7%)33 (7.4%)17 (3.8%)36 (8.1%)IIPP (PPPP)17675 (42.6%)39 (22.2%)22 (12.5%)40 (22.7%)IIIPR (PPR)405298 (73.6%)62 (15.3%)26 (6.4%)19 (4.7%)WAC (D00189)IPY (PPXY)752622 (82.7%)95 (12.6%)28 (3.7%)7 (0.9%)IIPL (PPLP)445342 (76.9%)54 (12.1%)28 (6.3%)21 (4.7%)IIPP (PPPP)17697 (55.1%)40 (22.7%)18 (10.2%)21 (11.9%)IIIPR (PPR)405314 (77.5%)49 (12.1%)17 (4.2%)25 (6.2%)Fe65 (D00243)IPY (PPXY)752554 (73.7%)153 (20.3%)35 (4.7%)10 (1.3%)IIPL (PPLP)445238 (53.5%)101 (22.7%)77 (17.3%)29 (6.5%)IIPP (PPPP)17672 (40.9%)55 (31.3%)32 (18.2%)17 (9.7%)IIIPR (PPR)405344 (84.9%)27 (6.7%)10 (2.5%)24 (5.9%) Open table in a new tab Table IIThe list of randomly selected example of ligands containing each motif for proteomic mappingPY motif ligandsPL motif ligandsPP motif ligandsPR motif ligandsPGTPPPNYDSERLWVGLPPLPSARCRFCPPPPPPYQNQSERMVPPRPDSLTSRGLPPPYDLTWVNAAPPRLLPPLPTCYGPPALPPPPPLAKFPGPPQPPPRAGPPKWEGEPPPPYSRPGVKLSPPLPPKKVMSQGPPPPPPYGRLLGLPQPPRASGQTPIAPPTYWEWALYENLPPLPPVWESPPPPPPPPPHSFIKQPAVPPRPSADLFSNRPPGYPSQPVSALEPPLPAAQSDFLPPPPPPLDDSSAPSHPPRPLLPLMSFHPPHYLAARAATMPPLPQPPLAPASGNFPPPPPLDEEAEEESPPRPSLSQLCYEPPTYSPAGPPASPPLPLPPPAAVQQQQPPPPPIPANGRKEEPPRPEFLEQTLVPPAYAPYPSITVNPPLPQDTVSLIPPPPPPKNVARLCRPPPRAPRAPAPYVEPPEYEFFWLSSFPPLPGAAGVPPPPPPPPFLRPGRAGRPPRPAAGPACWREPPAYTYRDSVMTPPLPLQDTIPAAPPPPPYPYLVYRHPPPRPANFE Open table in a new tab The GST fusion proteins of the WW domains were used in this proteomic mapping. However, the problem of avidity was probably significantly minimized because the fused WW domains were immobilized and not presented as free flowing samples in solution. Comparison of the Ligand-binding Sides of Groups I-IV WW Domains—The results of our survey prompted us to re-examine ligand-binding pockets of WW domains in hope of finding structural denominators common for Group II and III WW domains. Groups I and IV WW domains employ the same side of their bent-sheeted structure to recognize their respective ligands (Fig. 2, A–C). We assumed that the WW domains previously classified as Groups II and III would also use the same side to recognize their ligands. We constructed molecular models of the Group II and III WW domains (FBP11A, Fe65L2, and FBP30A) based on the sequence homology and compared their putative ligand-binding sides with those of Group I and IV WW domains to reveal the structural basis of their ligand specificity (Fig. 2, D–F).

IFN-α/β activates another important transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), but its role in IFN-mediated activity is poorly understood. Sensitivity to the antiviral and gene-inducing effects of IFN was examined in normal fibroblasts and in NF-κB knockout fibroblasts from p50- and p65-null mice. Antiviral assays demonstrated that NF-κB knockout fibroblasts were sensitized to the antiviral action of IFN. Moreover, analysis of IFN-stimulated gene expression by real-time PCR demonstrated selective effects of NF-κB on gene expression. Our results demonstrate that a subset of IFN-stimulated genes is regulated through an NF-κB-dependent pathway and that NF-κB may regulate the sensitivity of cells to IFN-mediated antiviral activity."

In this study, heparin and chemically modified heparins were tested as inhibitors of three human colon carcinoma cell lines (COLO320, LS174T, and CW-2) binding to P-selectin, adhering to CHO cells expressing a transfected human P-selectin cDNA, and adhering to surface-anchored platelets expressing P-selectin under static and flow conditions. The aim was to screen for heparin derivatives with high anti-adhesion activity but negligible anticoagulant activity. In this study, four modified heparins with high anti-adhesion activity were identified including RO-heparin, CR-heparin, 2/3ODS-heparin, and N/2/3DS-heparin. NMR analysis proved the reliability of structure of the four modified heparins. Our findings suggested that the 6-O-sulfate group of glucosamine units in heparin is critical for the inhibition of P-selectin-mediated tumor cell adhesion. Heparan sulfate-like proteoglycans on these tumor cell surfaces are implicated in adhesion of the tumor cells to P-selectin.

Hematogenous metastasis is a highly regulated and dynamic process in which the cancerous cells separate from the primary tumor, migrate across blood vessel walls into the bloodstream, and disperse throughout the body to generate new colonies. Several lines of experiments have demonstrated that platelets can facilitate hematogenous dissemination of tumor cells (1Karpatkin S. Pearlstein E. Ambrogio C. Coller B.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 81: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In this process, platelets act mainly through emboli complexes formed by the interaction of tumor cells and platelets. The formation of tumor cell-platelet emboli complexes in the blood stream not only provides a protective shield that masks them from the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells, but also favors tumor cell adhesion to vascular endothelial cells (2Borsig L.

The interaction between tumor cells and platelets may involve several kinds of adhesion molecules. Selectins are a family of intercellular adhesion molecules that mediate the initial adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelia of blood vessels during inflammation (5Wei M. Zeng X.L. Prog. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 30: 185-189Google Scholar, 6Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 7Kansas G.S.

The family includes E-, P-, and L-selectin, and all three selectins can bind to sialylated, fucosylated, or, in some cases, sulfated glycans on glycoproteins, glycolipids, or proteoglycans (10McEver R.P. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).

The role of P-selectin on both endothelium and platelets is to mediate the tumor cell adhesion to vascular endothelial cells and the interaction of activated platelets and tumor cells during metastasis. According to recent reports, P-selectin plays roles mainly in the initial process of tumor cell adhesion to platelets (19McCarty O.J. Mousa S.A. Bray P.F. Konstantopoulos K.

Therefore, blocking P-selectin on platelets with antagonists can effectively inhibit the formation of tumor cell-platelet emboli complexes and successfully prevent hematogenous metastasis. Various P-selectin antagonists have been discovered at present, such as mAbs, sLex, sLea, and its mimetics, as well as recombinant PSGL-1 (20Wang L. Brown J.R. Varki A. Esko J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). As these selectin inhibitors have various drawbacks, such as narrow cross-reactivity, weak affinity, relatively low selectivity among the selectins, short circulating half-life, great expense to generate, potential antigenicity, and a very limited track record as intravenous therapeutic agents, the development of these compounds into effective drugs for clinical use has been greatly limited. Heparin has been used clinically as an anticoagulant for over 60 years. Heparin and heparan sulfate are linear polysaccharides consisting of uronic acid-(1→4)-d-glucosamine-repeating disaccharide subunits. In addition to its effects on anticoagulant, heparin exhibits many other activities (21Rabenstein D.L. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 312-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that heparin and heparan sulfate are ligands for P-selectin and can block its binding to carbohydrate ligand (22Varki N.M. Varki A. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2002; 28: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, one of the proposed mechanisms by which heparin can inhibit metastasis is that heparin may block the P-selectin-based interaction of platelets and tumor cells during metastasis. It is reasonable that heparin should be a candidate for a clinical trial in the immediate future. However, the kind of native human tumors that actually use the P-selectin-based ligands to interact with platelets is unknown, and little information is available about the specific oligosaccharide structures in heparin that are recognized by P-selectin. In addition, heparin's significant anticoagulant properties and its potential for bleeding complications may contraindicate its use as an anti-metastasis compound. The anticoagulant activity of heparin depends on its unique antithrombin binding pentasaccharide sequence (23Petitou M. Casu B. Lindahl U. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Chemical modifications, which are directed against the unique structure, can effectively reduce the anticoagulant activities of heparin. In this study, we prepared eight chemically modified heparins and analyzed whether they could still effectively reduce tumor cell adhesion. The results demonstrated that heparin and four modified heparins could significantly inhibit P-selectin-mediated tumor cell adhesion. The sulfate groups at C6 on the glucosamine residues in heparin play a critical role in the inhibition. Our results also showed that three human colon carcinoma cell lines strongly expressed heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which are involved in adhesion of these tumor cells as a ligand of P-selectin. Our data suggest that some chemically modified heparins with low anticoagulant activities, such as 2/3ODS-heparin, have potential value for preventing tumor hematogenous metastasis. Heparin and Its Derivatives—Porcine intestinal heparin (Mr = 18,000–20,000) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. Periodate-oxidized, borohydride-reduced heparin (RO-heparin) was prepared according to the method of Casu et al. (24Casu B. Diamantini G. Fedeli G. Mantovani M. Oreste P. Pescador R. Porta R. Prino G. Torri G. Zoppetti G. Arzneimittelforschung. 1986; 36: 637-642PubMed Google Scholar). Carboxyl-reduced heparin (CR-heparin) and carboxyl-reduced sulfated heparin (CRS-heparin) were prepared as described by Wessel et al. (25Wessel H.P. Hosang M. Tschopp T.B. Weimann B.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 204: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 2-O, 3-O-desulfated heparin (2/3ODS-heparin) was prepared essentially according to the method of Fryer et al. (26Fryer A. Huang Y.C. Rao G. Jacoby D. Mancilla E. Whorton R. Piantadosi C.A. Kennedy T. Hoidal J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 208-219PubMed Google Scholar). A modified procedure of Nagasawa et al. (27Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Kamata T. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) was employed to prepare N-desulfated/N-acetylated heparin (NDS-heparin). N-Desulfated/2-O, 3-O-desulfated heparin (N/2/3DS-heparin) was typically prepared by 2-O, 3-O-desulfation of N-desulfated heparin as described for 2-O, 3-O-desulfated heparin. 6-O-Desulfated heparin (6ODS-heparin) and N-desulfated 6-O-desulfated heparin (N/6DS-heparin) was prepared as recently described (28Baumann H. Scheen H. Huppertz B. Keller R. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 308: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Kariya Y. Kyogashima M. Suzuki K. Isomura T. Sakamoto T. Horie K. Ishihara M. Takano R. Kamei K. Hara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25949-25958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The preparation contained about 10% fewer 2-O-sulfate groups. The anticoagulant activity of heparin and modified heparinoids was analyzed by aPTT assay. Clotting times were determined using an ACL200 Automated Coagulation Laboratory (Japan) and lyophilized silica aPTT kit. Protein and Antibodies—Recombinant human P-selectin/Fc chimera protein (P-Fc), 9E1 (a leukocyte adhesion blocking IgG mAb against P-selectin), and P1 (a leukocyte adhesion nonblocking IgG mAb against P-selectin) were purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. CSLEX-1, an IgM mAb to sLex, was a gift from O. Spertini. 10E4, an IgM mAb to the native heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycans, was generously provided by Dr. Guido David. KPL1, an IgG mAb to PSGL-1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Mouse IgM isotype control and FITC-conjugated Ab against mouse IgM were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. Human IgG and mouse IgG isotype control, FITC-conjugated Ab against human and mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Cells—The human colon carcinoma cells (COLO320, LS174T, and CW-2), CHO cells, and U937 cells were purchased from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China). They were cultured in IMDM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. COLO320 and CHO cells were harvested with 0.02% EDTA. LS174T and CW-2 cells were detached by mild trypsinization (0.25% trypsin/EDTA for 2 min at 37 °C; Invitrogen), and subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to regenerate surface glycoproteins, as previously described (11.Mannori, G., Crottet, P., Cecconi, O., Hanasaki, K., Aruffo, A., Nelson, R. M., Varki, A., and Bevilacqua, M. P. Cancer Res. 55, 4425–4431Google Scholar). Subsequently, tumor cells were washed once with PBS (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), resuspended in serum-free media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). CHO cells expressing a transfected human P-selectin cDNA (CHO-P cells) were generated by transient transfection of CHO cells, which was performed using the Poly-Fect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to instructions from the manufacturer. Heparinase Treatment—To remove cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, each aliquot (50 μl) of tumor cells (107/ml) was incubated with 5 units/ml heparinases I, II, and III (Sigma), in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 mg/ml leupeptin, 20 mg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm benzamidine, all from Sigma), for 1 h at 37 °C with end-to-end rotation (15Ma Y.Q. Geng J.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Following the enzyme treatment, tumor cells were washed twice and resuspended in PBS/FBS (PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1% heat-inactivated FBS; 5 × 106 cells/ml) for further experimentation. Immobilization of Platelet Layers on Glass Slides—To provide a substrate that readily binds platelets, circular glass slides were coated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APES; Sigma). Human blood was drawn by venipuncture from healthy volunteers into sodium citrate (0.38% w/v) anticoagulant. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifugation of whole blood at 200 × g for 15 min. The PRP count was adjusted to 2 × 108/ml before being bound to APES-treated circular glass slides for 60 min (30Buttrum S.M. Hatton R. Nash G.B. Blood. 1993; 82: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 0.1% BSA for 10 min at 37 °C. Under these conditions, a confluent layer of platelets was formed as evaluated by light microscopy for each experiment. The density and confluency of platelet layers were not affected during the flow experiment. Flow Cytometric Assays—All cells were washed once and resuspended in PBS/FBS (5 × 106 cells/ml). For the cell surface P-selectin binding assay, each aliquot (0.1 ml) of cells was incubated with 0.3 μg of human IgG or P-Fc at 22 °C for 20 min, followed by a FITC-conjugated Ab against human IgG at 22 °C for 1 h with end-to-end rotation. Cells were sedimented at 1500 rpm for 5 min in a tabletop centrifuge. Each aliquot was then resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS/FBS for immediate flow cytometric analysis (FACScan, Beckman-Counter). For antibody or heparin derivative inhibition experiments, 0.3 μg of P-Fc were preincubated with 1.0 μg of 9E1, P1, or heparin derivatives of various concentrations at 22 °C for 30 min. The following experiments were as above. For cell surface P-selectin ligand experiments, each aliquot (0.1 ml) of cells was incubated with 1∼2 μg of mouse IgM, mouse IgG, CSLEX-1 mAb, 10E4 mAb, or KPL1 mAb at 22 °C for 30 min, followed by treatment with a FITC-conjugated Ab against mouse IgM or mouse IgG at 22 °C for 1 h with end-over-end rotation. Laminar Flow Adhesion Assays—Tumor cell adhesion to immobilized platelets (or CHO-P cells) was quantitated under flow conditions using a parallel plate flow chamber (GlycoTech, Rockville, MD). All cells were washed once and resuspended to 1 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free media containing 0.1% BSA. A platelet-coated circular glass slide (or a CHO-P cell-coated 35-mm tissue culture dish) was assembled in a flow chamber and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a camera (Panasonic, Yokohama, Japan) and connected to a VCR and a TV monitor. Surface-adhered platelets were then incubated with either 1 unit/ml thrombin or Dulbecco's PBS, 0.1% BSA for 10 min at 37 °C. After washing the platelet layer with Dulbecco' s PBS, 0.1% BSA for ∼2 min, tumor cells were perfused through the chamber for 3 min at the appropriate flow rates to obtain wall shear stresses of 0.3–1.2 dyn/cm2 at 22 °C using a syringe pump (Cole-Parmer Instrument Co.), thereby mimicking the fluid mechanical environment of the microcirculation and postcapillary venules. Interactions between tumor cells and surface-adherent platelets (or CHO-P cells) were visualized in real time by phase-contrast videomicroscopy. The numbers of bound cells were quantified from videotape recordings of 10–20 fields of view obtained (3 min after flowing cells through the chamber) while scanning the lower plate of the flow chamber using a ×10 objective lens. Their number was manually determined by reviewing the videotapes. For some inhibition experiments, immobilized platelets (or CHO-P cells) were preincubated with mAb (20 μg/ml) or heparin derivatives with various concentrations at 22 °C for 30 min. Statistics—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance of differences between means was determined by analysis of variance. If means were shown to be significantly different, multiple comparisons by pairs were performed with the Tukey test. Probability values of p < .05 or p < .01 were selected to be statistically significant. COLO320 Cells Express P-selectin Ligand—P-selectin has been shown to bind to several human cancers and human cancer-derived cell lines, although which kind of native human tumors use P-selectin-based mechanisms to successfully metastasize is still not clear. In this assay, COLO320, a human colon carcinoma cell line, was first examined for the interaction with P-Fc using a static cell surface binding assay, and a FITC-conjugated Ab to human IgG was used to reveal the binding of P-Fc to tumor cells by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1, P-Fc, but not human IgG, bound to COLO320 cells. The percentage of positive cells binding to P-selectins was 90.3%. Preincubation of P-Fc with 9E1 (a leukocyte adhesion-blocking mAb to P-selectin), but not P1 (a leukocyte adhesion nonblocking mAb to P-selectin), inhibited this binding, confirming the binding specificity of P-selectin to COLO320 cells. Modified Heparins Inhibit P-selectin Binding to COLO320 Cells under Static Conditions—Using various well established methods, we prepared a series of chemically modified heparins, including RO-heparin, CR-heparin, CRS-heparin, 2/3ODS-heparin, NDS-heparin, N/2/3DS-heparin, 6ODS-heparin, and N/6DS-heparin. Representative saccharide units of each type of heparinoid are given in Fig. 2. The Sepharose CL-6B gel chromatographic analysis and the ion chromatographic analysis indicated that the integrity and the molecular weights (data not show) of the main structures of the eight chemically modified heparins remained whereas the sulfate content changed as expected (Table I).Table ISulfate content of modified heparinsModified heparinsSulfate contentaDetermined by ion chromatography.

As shown in Table II, all modified heparins had reduced their anticoagulant activities to some extent when measured with fresh human plasmas. The eight heparin derivatives can be ranked according to their anticoagulant activities as: heparin > RO-heparin > 2/3ODS-heparin > NDS-heparin > CR-heparin > CRS-heparin > 6ODS-heparin > N/2/3DS-heparin > N/6DS-heparin. These results indicate that the more the heparins were modified, the more their anticoagulant activities were reduced.Table IIAnticoagulant activities of modified heparinsaPTTaDetermined by the aPTT method.2 μg/ml4 μg/ml6 μg/ml8 μg/ml0.1 mg/ml1.0 mg/ml5.0 mg/mlControl30.330.330.330.330.330.330.3Heparin72.9>120bValues that are more than 120 seconds cannot be determined.RO-heparin34.539.644.249.3>120CR-heparin31.231.332.332.651.2>120CRS-heparin30.931.231.332.543.9>1202/3ODS-heparin32.934.837.239.463.4>120NDS-heparin31.632.333.134.057.9>120N/2/3DS-heparin30.830.830.931.033.740.168.86ODS-heparin31.931.431.831.136.880.9>120N/6DS-heparin31.331.331.730.630.833.446.2a Determined by the aPTT method.b Values that are more than 120 seconds cannot be determined. Open table in a new tab As discussed earlier, heparin can function as a ligand for P-selectin and can block P-selectin binding to its native carbohydrate ligands (22Varki N.M. Varki A. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2002; 28: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this assay, therefore, we examined whether modified heparins could inhibit the P-selectin binding under static conditions. First, we used heparin and modified heparins with a high concentration of 5.0 mg/ml to conduct the experiment. Fig. 3A shows that heparin, RO-heparin, CR-heparin, 2/3ODS-heparin, and N/2/3DS-heparin, but not CRS-heparin, NDS-heparin, 6ODS-heparin, and N/6DS-heparin, could significantly abolish the binding of P-selectin to COLO320 cells. Compared with the positive control, the preincubation of heparin, RO-heparin, CR-heparin, 2/3ODS-heparin, and N/2/3DS-heparin reduces the percentage of COLO320 cells binding to P-selectin by 92, 81, 80, 80, and 71%, respectively. In the following experiments, we tested the above four modified heparins with low concentrations of 1.0 mg/ml and 0.1 mg/ml to determine their ability to inhibit tumor cells binding to P-selectin. The results showed that the four modified heparins at concentrations of 1.0 mg/ml, to some extent, had an inhibiting effect (Fig. 3B). However, at the concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, the inhibition was faint (Fig. 3C). In brief, the results indicated that some modified heparins remain able to inhibit P-selectin binding to tumor cells, and the ability is proportionally related to their concentration. Modified Heparins Inhibit COLO320 Cells Adhering to CHO-P Cells under Flow Conditions—The previous experiment proved that human colon carcinoma COLO320 cells can bind to P-selectin under static conditions, and the binding can be inhibited by heparin and the four modified heparins. However, in the experiment above, recombinant human P-selectin/Fc chimera protein (P-Fc) was used instead of P-selectin, and the experiment was conducted under static conditions. Therefore, these experiments cannot completely reflect the binding of tumor cells to P-selectin under physiological conditions. To corroborate the above findings, CHO cells expressing a transfected human P-selectin cDNA (CHO-P) was used as the carrier of P-selectin, and the flow adhesion assay, mimicking the fluid mechanical environment of the microcirculation and postcapillary venules in vitro, was performed. In this assay, tumor cells were perfused through a parallel plate flow chamber whose lower plate was coated with a layer of CHO-P cells at the appropriate flow rates to obtain wall shear stresses of 0.3 dyn/cm2. The interaction of tumor cells and CHO-P cells can be observed when the tumor cells run through the surface of CHO-P cells. As shown in Fig. 4, COLO320 cells bound to CHO-P cells, but not to CHO cells. Preincubation of CHO-P cells with 9E1, but not P1, inhibited this binding, indicating the binding specificity of COLO320 cells to CHO-P cells. To investigate whether heparin and the four modified heparins could inhibit the binding of COLO320 cells to CHO-P cells, we conducted the following experiments. In the experiments, the concentration of the modified heparins was 5.0 mg/ml, and the wall shear stress was 0.3 dyn/cm2. The results showed that heparin, RO-heparin, CR-heparin, 2/3ODS-heparin, and N/2/3DS-heparin could significantly abolish the adhesion of COLO320 cells to CHO-P cells (Fig. 4). Compared with the positive control, the preincubation of heparin, RO-heparin, CR-heparin, 2/3ODS-heparin, and N/2/3DS-heparin reduced the percentage of COLO320 cell adhesion to CHO-P cells by 79, 77, 64, 64, and 66%, respectively. Modified Heparins Inhibit COLO320 Cells Adhering to Surface-immobilized Platelets under Flow Conditions—The interaction between platelets and the tumor cells is crucial to successful metastasis. Previous studies have shown that platelets interact with a number of tumor cell lines, but the cell adhesion experiments were conducted exclusively under static conditions (11.Mannori, G., Crottet, P., Cecconi, O., Hanasaki, K., Aruffo, A., Nelson, R. M., Varki, A., and Bevilacqua, M. P. Cancer Res. 55, 4425–4431Google Scholar, 12Stone J.P. Wagner D.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 31Kim Y.J. Borsig L. Han H.L. Varki N.M. Varki A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 461-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To determine whether COLO320 cells also adhere to platelets under flow conditions and to determine the role of P-selectin on platelets in the process of cell adhesion, tumor cells were perfused through a parallel plate flow chamber whose lower plate was coated with a layer of platelets. Fig. 5A shows that immobilized platelets supported COLO320 cell adhesion in a shear stress-dependent manner. No interaction was observed at 1.2 dyn/cm2. In the following experiments, using mAb against P-selectin, we examined the potential role of platelet P-selectin in the adhesive interaction under flow conditions. The results showed that incubation of the platelets layer with 9E1 alone resulted in an ∼50–58% reduction of adhesion at 0.3 dyn/cm2 or 0.6 dyn/cm2, and P1 nearly had no effect on the adhesion (Fig. 5, B and C). The results above indicated that COLO320 cells could adhere to platelets under flow, and P-selectin, which expresses on the surface of platelets, plays an important role in the process of the adhesion of tumor cells to platelets. In the following step, we examined the effect of heparin and the four modified heparins on inhibiting the adhesion of COLO320 cells to surface-immobilized platelets under flow conditions. The results showed that heparin and the four modified heparins could significantly inhibit the adhesion of COLO320 cells to surface-immobilized platelets. At all concentrations of modified heparins used in the experiment, 5.0, 1.0, and 0.1 mg/ml, were dramatically effective for blocking the adhesion of the tumor cells to the surface-adhered platelets under the condition of the wall shear stress of 0.3 dyn/cm2 or 0.6 dyn/cm2 (Fig. 5, B and C). Even at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, which is the lowest concentration tested, heparin and the four modified heparins could still significantly inhibit the adhesion of COLO320 cells to surface-immobilized platelets. Adhesion of COLO320 Cells to P-selectin Involves Heparan Sulfate-like Proteoglycans—We next attempted to identify the counter receptor for platelet P-selectin on COLO320 cell surface using oligosaccharide-specific mAbs. In this assay, we used U937 cells as a control because U937 cells express PSGL-1, a natural ligand for P-selectin, and it is well known that under flow conditions, U937 cells can roll on and adhere to immobilized P-selectin.

We used a split synthetic renilla luciferase (hRLUC) complementation-based bioluminescence assay to study homodimerization of herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (TK) in mammalian cells and in living mice. We quantified and imaged homodimerization of TK chimeras containing N-terminal (N-hRLUC) or C-terminal (C- hRLUC) fragments of hRLUC in the upstream and downstream positions, respectively (tail-to- head homodimer). This was monitored using luminometry (68-fold increase, and was significantly [P<0.01] above background light emission) and by CCD camera imaging of living mice implanted with ex vivo transfected 293T cells (2.7-fold increase, and is significantly [P<0.01] above background light emission). We also made a mutant-TK to generate N-hRLUC mutant TK and mutant TK-C-hRLUC by changing a single amino acid at position 318 from arginine to cysteine, a key site that has previously been reported to be essential for TK homo- dimerization, to support the specificity of the hRLUC complementation signal from TK homodimerization. Ex vivo substrate (8-3H Penciclovir) accumulation assays in 293T cells expressing the TK protein chimeras showed active TK enzyme. We also devised an experimental strategy by constructing variant TK chimeras (possessing extra N-hRLUC or C-hRLUC ‘spacers’) to monitor incremental lack of association of the tail-to-head TK homodimer. Application of this potentially generalizable assay to screen for molecules that promote or disrupt ubiquitous homodimeric protein–protein interactions could serve not only as an invaluable tool to understand biological networks but could also be applied to drug discovery and validation in living subjects."

Interleukin-7 (IL-7) inhibits TGF-β signaling by up-regulating Smad7, a major inhibitor of the Smad family.

Inhibition of PKC-δ with specific small inhibitory RNA restores TGF-β-mediated induction of Smad7 and in parallel significantly reduces TGF-β-mediated collagen synthesis.

TGF-β induces phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which form hetero-oligomeric complex with Smad4 that translocate to the nucleus, where they recognize Smad binding elements to regulate transcriptional responses of target genes (4Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Smad7 is a major inhibitory member of the Smad family (4Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Smad7 inhibits TGF-β-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and competes with Smad2/3 for the binding to TGF-β receptor. TGF-β rapidly induces expression of Smad7 mRNA, suggesting a negative feedback loop to control TGF-β signaling (4Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that IL-7 possesses potent antifibrotic activities in vitro and in vivo (5Huang M. Sharma S. Zhu L.X. Keane M.P. Luo J. Zhang L. Burdick M.D. Lin Y.Q. Dohadwala M. Gardner B. Batra R.K. Strieter R.M. Dubinett S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 931-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-7 inhibits TGF-β signaling through the induction of Smad7 (5Huang M. Sharma S. Zhu L.X. Keane M.P. Luo J. Zhang L. Burdick M.D. Lin Y.Q. Dohadwala M. Gardner B. Batra R.K. Strieter R.M. Dubinett S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 931-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Smads, TGF-β requires active PKC-δ to activate its target genes in a variety of cells including pulmonary fibroblasts (1Kucich U. Rosenbloom J.C. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). PKC-δ, a ubiquitously expressed kinase involved in a variety of cellular signaling pathways, has been implicated in de novo synthesis of extracellular matrix components (6Runyan C.E. Schnaper H.W. Poncelet A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F413-F422Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PKC-δ participates in the up-regulation of type I (COL1A1) and type III (COL3A1) collagen gene expression mediated by TGF-β in scleroderma fibroblasts (7Jimenez S.A. Gaidarova S. Saitta B. Sandorfi N. Herrich D.J. Rosenbloom J.C. Kucich U. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1395-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Based on the importance of PKC-δ in TGF-β signaling, we determined whether PKC-δ modulated collagen synthesis in response to TGF-β and IL-7 stimulation in pulmonary fibroblasts. Cell Culture—Isolation, passage, and specific cell marker characterization of human pulmonary fibroblasts were performed as described previously (5Huang M. Sharma S. Zhu L.X. Keane M.P. Luo J. Zhang L. Burdick M.D. Lin Y.Q. Dohadwala M. Gardner B. Batra R.K. Strieter R.M. Dubinett S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 931-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts obtained from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (PFF) or non-fibrotic lung diseases (NF) were maintained in 5% CO2 in air as monolayers at 37 °C in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks containing 20 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). Cytokines and Antibodies—Human recombinant TGF-β1 (3.2 × 104 units/μg) and recombinant human IL-7 (105 units/μg) were obtained from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. Rabbit anti-PKC-δ, rabbit anti-PKC-δ-[Ser645], and rabbit anti-PKC-δ-[pTyr311] antibodies were obtained from BIOSOURCE International, Inc., Camarillo, CA. Rabbit anti-PKC-δ [pThr505] antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA. Lyophilized human recombinant TGF-β1 was reconstructed in sterile 4 mm HCl containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin in a final concentration of 10 μg/ml and stored at –70 °C in aliquots. Northern Blot Analysis—High quality total RNA from 107 cells of NF and PFF was prepared by the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). Northern blotting was performed as previously described (8Huang M. Lindahl R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We used the following unique 30-mer oligonucleotide probes for the detection of human COL1A1 and COL3A1 gene expression: 5′-CAGTTCTTGGTCTCGTCACAGATCACGTCA-3′ (human COL1A1 probe, corresponding to the coding region 332–361) and 5′-TTCCATTTTCTCCTGGAGGACCACCTGTAC-3′ (human COL3A1 probe, corresponding to the coding region 2051–2080). Duplicate filters were hybridized with 32P-radiolabeled human β-actin cDNA probe serving as controls for equal loading and transfer. The filters were exposed to an x-ray film for documentation and analyzed using phosphor imaging equipment (Molecular Imager, Bio-Rad). PKC-δ Activity Assays—PFF and NF were incubated in medium alone, in medium containing IL-7 (100 ng/ml), in medium containing TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), or in medium containing IL-7 and TGF-β1 for 1 h at 37 °C. 5 × 106 Cells of each sample were lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium prophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitors. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a specific anti-PKC-δ antibody (BIOSOURCE International, Inc.). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with phosphorylation lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer, which contains 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg of phosphatidylserine, and 20 mm ATP. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of an exogenous substrate histone H1 and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of SDS sample buffer. The PKC-δ activity was determined by the amount of 32P-histone H1 produced as detected by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Western Blot Analysis—PFF and NF under standard growth conditions or in medium supplemented with cytokines were suspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitors (10 μl/ml), and 0.1% Triton X-100. The cell suspension was sonicated and then centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein content of each sample was determined using the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Aliquots containing 80 μg of lysate were boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were transferred to Immuno-Blot membranes (Bio-Rad), blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk, and then incubated with specific primary antibodies. The immunoreactive proteins were detected using a ProtoBlot II AP System kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). PKC-δ siRNA—PKC-δ siRNA Duplex1 for the target sequence 5′-AAG ATG AAG GAG GCG CTC AG-3′ was obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Two micrograms of PKC-δ siRNA were premixed with TransMessenger Transfection Reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) in a ratio of 1:2 to 1:8. PFF and NF were then transfected with PKC-δ siRNA mixture or solvent only as controls for 3 h under standard growth condition. Real-time RT-PCR—Five hundred nanograms of total RNA from PFF (n = 2) and NF (n = 3) were used for the real-time RT-PCR analysis using unique target gene primers or housekeeping gene β-actin primers serving as controls for equal loading. Primer pairs for the optimal real-time RT-PCR results were designed with the assistance of ongoing consultation with the technical team of the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). We used the following unique primer pairs for the detection of human Smad7 mRNA by the real-time RT-PCR: 5′-CTGCAACCCCCATCACCTTA-3′ (Smad7 sense primer) and 5′-CCCTGTTTCAGCGGAGGAA-3′ (Smad7 antisense primer). We used the following unique primer pairs for the detection of human β-actin mRNA serving as controls for equal loading by the real-time RT-PCR: 5′-GATGAGATTGGCATGGCTTT-3′ (β-actin sense primer) and 5′-CACCTTCACCGTTCCAGTTT-3′ (β-actin antisence primer). The Smad7 primer pairs correspond to the coding region 576–709 and the amplified products are 134 bp in length. The β-actin primer pairs correspond to the coding region 1233–1332, and the amplified products are 100 bp in length. Both Smad7 and β-actin amplified products have minimal secondary structures, and the melt curve analysis showed no nonspecific amplicon or primer/dimer formation. A QuantiTect CYBRGreen RT-PCR kit (Qiagen Inc.) was used to prepare the real-time RT-PCR reaction mixture. Real-time RT-PCR was performed at 50 °C for 1 h using unique antisense primers for the RT step followed by 45 cycles of amplification using an iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The real-time RT-PCR data were simultaneously analyzed using the same system. Collagen Assays—Collagen assay was performed using the Sircol collagen assay method (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY) as described previously (5Huang M. Sharma S. Zhu L.X. Keane M.P. Luo J. Zhang L. Burdick M.D. Lin Y.Q. Dohadwala M. Gardner B. Batra R.K. Strieter R.M. Dubinett S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 931-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The results are presented as means ± S.D. from single experiment that are representative of at least three replicate experiments. Significance between experimental versus control values was calculated using the Student's t test. IL-7 Inhibits TGF-β-induced COL1A1 and COL3A1 Gene Expression in PFF—To determine whether IL-7 modulates TGF-β-induced collagen synthesis at the level of regulating COL1A1 and COL3A1 gene expresion, PFF were incubated in medium only, in medium containing acid-activated recombinant TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), or in medium containing TGF-β1 plus IL-7 (100 ng/ml). When used at this concentration TGF-β1 does not significantly impact fibroblast proliferation at 24 h (5Huang M. Sharma S. Zhu L.X. Keane M.P. Luo J. Zhang L. Burdick M.D. Lin Y.Q. Dohadwala M. Gardner B. Batra R.K. Strieter R.M. Dubinett S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 931-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After a 24-h incubation, cells were harvested for Northern blot analysis using 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes that recognize unique human COL1A1 and COL3A1 transcripts. IL-7 significantly reduced TGF-β-mediated induction of COL1A1 and COL3A1 mRNA levels (Fig. 1). IL-7 and TGF-β Have Opposing Effects on PKC-δ Activity in PFF—We previously showed that IL-7 inhibited TGF-β signaling in a Smad-7-dependent manner (5Huang M. Sharma S. Zhu L.X. Keane M.P. Luo J. Zhang L. Burdick M.D. Lin Y.Q. Dohadwala M. Gardner B. Batra R.K. Strieter R.M. Dubinett S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 931-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the importance of PKC-δ in TGF-β signaling, we determined the role of PKC-δ in IL-7-mediated inhibition of TGF-β signaling by analysis of PKC-δ kinase activity. PFF and NF were exposed to the following conditions: medium only, IL-7 (100 ng/ml), TGF-β (10 ng/ml), or IL-7 + TGF-β at 37 °C for 1 h (1Kucich U. Rosenbloom J.C. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Runyan C.E. Schnaper H.W. Poncelet A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F413-F422Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The PKC-δ activity was determined by the amount of 32P-histone H1 produced as detected by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The results show that IL-7 inhibited both constitutive and TGF-β-induced PKC-δ activity in PFF but had no effect on PKC-δ activity in NF (Fig. 2). Thus, IL-7 and TGF-β have opposing effect on PKC-δ activity; IL-7 is inhibitory, while TGF-β is stimulatory, in PFF. IL-7 Inhibits TGF-β-mediated Phosphorylation of PKC-δ at Thr-505 and Ser-645 in PFF—PKC-δ mediates a wide range of biological responses, and its activity is controlled by distinct phosphorylation sites (9Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). To determine the characteristic phosphorylation patterns of PKC-δ activation regulated by IL-7 and TGF-β in NF and PFF, we performed Western blot analysis using a panel of specific monoclonal antibodies including anti-total PKC-δ, anti-phospho-PKC-δ-[pThr505], anti-phospho-PKC-δ-[pTyr311], and anti-phospho-PKC-δ-[pSer645] antibodies. PFF and NF were incubated in the following conditions: medium only, IL-7 (100 ng/ml), TGF-β (10 ng/ml), and IL-7 + TGF-β at 37 °C for 1 h (6Runyan C.E. Schnaper H.W. Poncelet A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F413-F422Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, TGF-β stimulated phosphorylation of PKC-δ at Ser-645 and Thr-505 in PFF, while IL-7 inhibited this process. Consistent with our previous findings, PKC-δ phosphorylation status in NF was not influenced by IL-7 and TGF-β. The results suggest that the opposing effects of IL-7 and TGF-β on PKC-δ activity in PFF may be due to the differential regulation of post-translational PKC-δ phosphorylation. Inhibition of PKC-δ with Specific siRNA Significantly Increased Smad7 mRNA Levels and, in Parallel, Reduced TGF-β-mediated Collagen Synthesis in PFF—PKC-δ is implicated in de novo synthesis of connective tissue and extracellular matrix components (9Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). For example, TGF-β-stimulated PKC-δ activity positively regulates Smad transcriptional activity resulting in up-regulation of the COL1A2 gene expression in renal mesangial cells (6Runyan C.E. Schnaper H.W. Poncelet A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F413-F422Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have shown that IL-7 inhibits TGF-β-mediated collagen synthesis through the induction of Smad7 (5Huang M. Sharma S. Zhu L.X. Keane M.P. Luo J. Zhang L. Burdick M.D. Lin Y.Q. Dohadwala M. Gardner B. Batra R.K. Strieter R.M. Dubinett S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 931-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the importance of PKC-δ in a variety of cellular signaling pathways including TGF-β signaling, we tested whether PKC-δ may play a role in the regulation of collagen synthesis in response to TGF-β and IL-7 stimulation in PFF. In preliminary studies, we tested the conditions for optimal gene silencing with PKC-δ siRNA in PFF. As demonstrated by Western blot analysis in Fig. 4A, PKC-δ siRNA, mixed with transfection reagent in a ratio of 1:8, provided an optimal gene silencing effect of PKC-δ (>95% reduction of gene products), while β-actin levels, serving as controls for equal loading, remained unchanged. To determine the role of PKC-δ in Smad7 gene regulation, NF (n = 2) and PFF (n = 3) were preincubated in medium with or without PKC-δ siRNA for 24 h. TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) was then added to the cultures, and cells were incubated for additional 90 min prior to isolation of total RNA (10Patil S. Wildey G.M. Brown T.L. Choy L. Derynck R. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38363-38370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Smad7 mRNA levels of each sample were determined by realtime RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 4B. TGF-β significantly increased Smad7 mRNA expression levels up to 16-fold in NF, while TGF-β had no significant effect on Smad7 mRNA levels in PFF (p < 0.01). However, when PFF were incubated with TGF-β + PKC-δ siRNA, Smad7 mRNA levels only increased 7.3-fold compared with cells incubated with TGF-β alone (p < 0.05). In comparison, inhibition of PKC-δ with specific siRNA in NF did not show significant differences in Smad7 mRNA levels. The results suggest that PKC-δ is important in TGF-β-mediated regulation of Smad7 gene expression in lung fibroblasts. Based on our results and those of others (6Runyan C.E. Schnaper H.W. Poncelet A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F413-F422Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that TGF-β-mediated collagen synthesis in PFF could be blocked by the inhibition of PKC-δ. PFF (n = 3) was cultured in medium alone, in medium containing TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), or in medium containing TGF-β1 plus PKC-δ siRNA for 24 h. The inhibition of PKC-δ with siRNA significantly reduced collagen levels (47–100% reduction) in response to TGF-β stimulation in PFF (Fig. 4C). Thus, PKC-δ may play a critical role in the regulation of fibroblast collagen synthesis in pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease with less than a 50% 5-year survival (11Gross T. Hunninghake M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). While steroids and other immunosuppressive agents serve as the standard treatment for IPF, these agents are ineffective. The development of new therapeutic paradigms is clearly a clinical priority. The pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis includes the deterioration of the normal homeostatic mechanisms regulating the equilibrium between the synthesis and breakdown of the extracellular matrix (2Broekelmann T.J. Limper A.H. Colby T.V. McDonald J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 3Khalil N. Bereznay O. Sporn M. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp.

Invest. 2001; 107: 1501-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). TGF-β plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis by enhancing synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix components including collagen (2Broekelmann T.J. Limper A.H. Colby T.V. McDonald J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 3Khalil N. Bereznay O. Sporn M. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 727-737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the importance of TGF-β in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, we investigated the mechanisms of dysregulation of TGF-β signaling in PFF. We reported previously that IL-7 has the capacity to block TGF-β signaling by up-regulation of Smad7, a major inhibitory member of the Smad family. In vitro, IL-7 inhibits fibroblast collagen deposition in a Smad-7-dependent manner (5Huang M. Sharma S. Zhu L.X. Keane M.P. Luo J. Zhang L. Burdick M.D. Lin Y.Q. Dohadwala M. Gardner B. Batra R.K. Strieter R.M. Dubinett S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 931-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, IL-7 limits pulmonary fibrosis (5Huang M. Sharma S. Zhu L.X. Keane M.P. Luo J. Zhang L. Burdick M.D. Lin Y.Q. Dohadwala M. Gardner B. Batra R.K. Strieter R.M. Dubinett S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 931-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because collagen types I and III are major components of extracellular matrix in pulmonary fibrosis (2Broekelmann T.J. Limper A.H. Colby T.V. McDonald J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 3Khalil N. Bereznay O. Sporn M. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 727-737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we first investigated the effect of IL-7 on TGF-β-mediated induction of COL1A1 and COL3A1 gene expression in PFF. Consistent with a marked reduction in collagen synthesis as previously reported, the current results show that IL-7 inhibits TGF-β-mediated induction of COL1A1 and COL3A1 gene expression in PFF. Thus, IL-7 inhibits TGF-β-mediated collagen synthesis at both mRNA and protein levels. PKC-δ is a member of the PKC family of serine-threonine kinases, which play important roles in signaling for various cytokine receptors. Specifically relevant to our current study, the Smad cascade and PKC-δ mediate TGF-β1-induced target gene expression in a variety of cell types (1Kucich U. Rosenbloom J.C. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Runyan C.E. Schnaper H.W. Poncelet A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F413-F422Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that inhibition of PKC-δ results in marked reduction in TGF-β-induced COL1A1 and COL3A1 mRNA expression (13Li W. Mischak H. Yu J.C. Wang L.M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2349-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that PKC-δ may play an important role in the regulation of TGF-β-mediated collagen synthesis. In the current study, we have shown that TGF-β stimulates, while IL-7 inhibits, PKC-δ activity in PFF. These opposing effects of TGF-β and IL-7 on PKC-δ correlate well with our previously published work; TGF-β stimulates, while IL-7 inhibits, collagen synthesis in PFF. TGF-β stimulates phosphorylation of PKC-δ at Ser-645 and Thr-505, while IL-7 inhibits this process in PFF. TGF-β receptors have intrinsic serine-threonine kinase activity, which serves as a key component in the activation of intracellular TGF-β signaling (1Kucich U. Rosenbloom J.C. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that IL-7 may inhibit TGF-β-mediated PKC-δ phosphorylation of Ser-645 and Thr-505 by interfering with TGF-β receptor intrinsic kinase activity in cells in which PKC-δ is a downstream target of TGF-β receptor serine-threonine kinases. In addition to phosphorylation on Ser-645 and Thr-505, PKC-δ can also be phosphorylated by various tyrosine kinases including Fyn, Src, Lyn, Lck, and Abl (1Kucich U. Rosenbloom J.C. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Our results show that TGF-β and IL-7 have no effect on PKC-δ phosphorylation at Tyr-311 in both PFF and NF. Thus, Tyr-311 phosphorylation may not be required for PKC-δ activity in human pulmonary fibroblasts. We (5Huang M. Sharma S. Zhu L.X. Keane M.P. Luo J. Zhang L. Burdick M.D. Lin Y.Q. Dohadwala M.

Care Med. 2001; 164: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have reported marked phenotypic and functional differences between PFF and NF. These differences have been demonstrated at multiple levels including TGF-β receptor expression, expression of cell surface receptors or signal transduction mediators, regulation of TGF-β signaling, and response to cytokines or other stimulators. Normal fibroblasts have the capacity to produce TGF-β in response to a variety of stimuli. This production of TGF-β then serves to control and mediate processes such as wound repair. However, following TGF-β production, regulatory mechanisms must also be initiated to limit TGF-β signaling and avoid, for example, uncontrolled collagen production and fibrogenesis. Thus, exposure of normal cells to TGF-β leads to the rapid induction of Smad7 mRNA expression. In the current study, Smad7 mRNA levels rapidly increased in response to TGF-β stimulation in NF, while no significant differences were observed in PFF. The results suggest that the normal negative feedback regulatory mechanism for TGF-β signaling may be impaired in PFF. Thus, NF are endowed with balanced fibrogenic and antifibrogenic regulatory mechanisms and appear to be resistant to aberrant signals seen in pulmonary fibrosis. In comparison, PFF have a fibrogenic phenotype. Importantly, inhibition of PKC-δ (>95% inhibition) with specific siRNA significantly increased Smad7 mRNA levels and, in parallel, reduced TGF-β-mediated collagen synthesis in PFF. The results suggest that the inhibition of PKC-δ may at least partially restore the negative feedback of TGF-β in PFF by facilitating an increase in Smad7. IL-7 is a cytokine within the IL-2 receptor common γ chain (IL-2Rγ(c) superfamily (18Xiao H. Yin T. Wang X.Y. Uchida T. Chung J. White M.F. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8091-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). IL-7 receptor (IL-7Rα/γ(c)) is comprised of a unique α chain (IL-7Rα) and a common γ (IL-7Rγ) subunit shared by other cytokine receptors including IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, and IL-15 (19Kondo M. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Watanabe S. Arai K. Sugamura K. Science. 1993; 262: 1874-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Activation of the JAK/STAT pathway has been implicated in IL-7 signaling (5Huang M. Sharma S. Zhu L.X. Keane M.P. Luo J. Zhang L. Burdick M.D. Lin Y.Q. Dohadwala M. Gardner B. Batra R.K.

Specifically, IL-7 is known to activate JAK1 through the ligand-specific IL-7Rα chain and subsequently activate STATs, while the shared IL-7Rγ(c) subunit cross-linking by ligands activates JAK3, an upstream activator of a variety of signal transduction pathways (21Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Minami Y. Liu Z.J. Oishi I. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In vitro, IL-7 has the capacity to inhibit fibroblast TGF-β signaling in a JAK1/STAT1-dependent manner. In vivo, IL-7 decreases bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Here we show for the first time that the counter-regulatory roles mediated by IL-7 and TGF-β in pulmonary fibroblast Smad7 expression and collagen synthesis are PKC-δ-dependent. PKC-δ may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and serve as a molecular target for therapeutic intervention. The development of pathogenesis-based therapy for pulmonary fibrosis offers an entirely new avenue for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1968935539,"Cobra venom factor (CVF) is the complement-activating protein from cobra venom. It is a structural and functional analog of complement component C3. CVF functionally resembles C3b, the activated form of C3. Like C3b, CVF binds factor B, which is subsequently cleaved by factor D to form the bimolecular complex CVF,Bb. CVF,Bb is a C3/C5 convertase that cleaves both complement components C3 and C5. CVF is a three-chain protein that structurally resembles the C3b degradation product C3c, which is unable to form a C3/C5 convertase. Both C3 and CVF are synthesized as single-chain prepro-proteins. This study reports the recombinant expression of pro-CVF in two insect cell expression systems (baculovirus-infected Sf9 Spodoptera frugiperda cells and stably transfected S2 Drosophila melanogaster cells). In both expression systems pro-CVF is synthesized initially as a single-chain pro-CVF molecule that is subsequently proteolytically processed into a two-chain form of pro-CVF that structurally resembles C3. The C3-like form of pro-CVF can be further proteolytically processed into another two-chain form of pro-CVF that structurally resembles C3b. Unexpectedly, all three forms of pro-CVF exhibit functional activity of mature, natural CVF. Recombinant pro-CVF supports the activation of factor B in the presence of factor D and Mg2+ and depletes serum complement activity like natural CVF. The bimolecular convertase pro-CVF,Bb exhibits both C3 cleaving and C5 cleaving activity. The activity of pro-CVF and the resulting C3/C5 convertase is indistinguishable from CVF and the CVF,Bb convertase. The ability to produce active forms of pro-CVF recombinantly ensures the continued availability of an important research reagent for complement depletion because cobra venom as the source for natural CVF will be increasingly difficult to obtain as the Indian cobra is on the list of endangered species. Experimental systems to express pro-CVF recombinantly will also be invaluable for studies to delineate the structure and function relationship of CVF and its differences from C3 as well as to generate human C3 derivatives with CVF-like function for therapeutic complement depletion (“humanized CVF”).

Cobra venom factor (CVF) 1The abbreviations used are: CVF, cobra venom factor; VBS++, Veronal-buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium.1The abbreviations used are: CVF, cobra venom factor; VBS++, Veronal-buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium. is the complement-activating protein in cobra venom (for review, see Refs. 1Vogel C.-W.

Like C3b, the activated form of complement component C3, CVF binds to factor B in human and mammalian serum to form the complex CVF,B (3Hensley P. O'Keefe M.C. Spangler C.J. Osborne Jr., J.C.

The bimolecular complex CVF,Bb is a C3/C5 convertase that activates C3 and C5 analogously to C3b,Bb, the C3/C5 convertase of the alternative complement pathway (5Vogel C.-W. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J.

Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8292-8299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is resistant to inactivation by the regulatory proteins factors H and I (10Lachmann P.J. Halbwachs L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1975; 21: 109-114PubMed Google Scholar, 11Alper C.A. Balavitch D. Science. 1976; 191: 1275-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12Nagaki K. Iida K. Okubo M. Inai S. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1978; 57: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both enzymes exhibit spontaneous decay dissociation at 37 °C into the two respective subunits. However, the half-life of this decay dissociation is 7 h for CVF,Bb (5Vogel C.-W. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8292-8299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and only 1.5 min for C3b,Bb (13Medicus R.G. Götze O. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 1076-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, C3b,Bb is effectively disassembled by factor H (14Pangburn M.K. Schreiber R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 146: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), and C3b is subsequently inactivated by factor I (15Whaley K. Ruddy S. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 1147-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In contrast, CVF,Bb and CVF are resistant to these two regulatory proteins (10Lachmann P.J. Halbwachs L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1975; 21: 109-114PubMed Google Scholar, 11Alper C.A. Balavitch D. Science. 1976; 191: 1275-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12Nagaki K. Iida K. Okubo M. Inai S. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1978; 57: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because of its stability and resistance to regulation, the CVF,Bb enzyme will continuously hydrolyze C3 and C5, eventually resulting in complement depletion. This property of CVF,Bb is frequently exploited to decomplement laboratory animals by injection of CVF (1Vogel C.-W. Tu A.T. Handbook of Natural Toxins: Reptile and Amphibian Venoms. 5. Marcel Dekker, New York1991: 147-188Google Scholar). Complement depletion by CVF has become an important experimental tool to study the role of complement in the immune response, in host defense, and in the pathogenesis of diseases (1Vogel C.-W. Tu A.T. Handbook of Natural Toxins: Reptile and Amphibian Venoms. 5. Marcel Dekker, New York1991: 147-188Google Scholar, 16Morgan B.P. Harris C.L. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).As expected from the functional similarity of CVF and C3b, these two proteins have been shown to exhibit several structural similarities, including immunological cross-reactivity, secondary structure, and N-terminal amino acid sequence (17Vogel C.-W. Smith C.A. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 3235-3241PubMed Google Scholar, 18Eggertsen G. Lind P. Sjøquist J. Mol. Immunol. 1981; 18: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The molecular cloning of CVF revealed extensive homology with mammalian and cobra C3 (19Fritzinger D.C. Bredehorst R. Vogel C.-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12775-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Fritzinger D.C. Petrella E.C. Connelly M.B. Bredehorst R. Vogel C.-W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3554-3562PubMed Google Scholar). Like C3, CVF is synthesized as a single-chain prepro-protein that exhibits 93.3% identity at the DNA level and 84.7% identity at the protein level with cobra C3 (19Fritzinger D.C. Bredehorst R. Vogel C.-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12775-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Fritzinger D.C. Petrella E.C. Connelly M.B. Bredehorst R. Vogel C.-W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3554-3562PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the post-translational proteolytic processing of pro-C3 is limited to the removal of four arginine residues, resulting in the mature two-chain C3 molecule consisting of a 115-kDa α-chain and a 70-kDa β-chain (21de Bruijn M.H. Fey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), the proteolytic processing of pro-CVF in the venom gland is more complex. It involves, in addition to the removal of four arginine residues, the proteolytic removal of the C3a-like and C3d-like domains, resulting in the mature three-chain form of CVF consisting of the 70-kDa α-chain, 48-kDa β-chain, and the 32-kDa γ-chain (17Vogel C.-W. Smith C.A. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 3235-3241PubMed Google Scholar, 18Eggertsen G. Lind P. Sjøquist J. Mol.

Fig. 1 summarizes the chain structures of CVF and C3 and their respective homologies.In this manuscript we describe the recombinant expression of single-chain and two two-chain forms of pro-CVF using two different eukaryotic expression systems. Unexpectedly, all three forms of pro-CVF exhibit the functional activity of forming a C3/C5 convertase and depleting complement that is indistinguishable from natural CVF, without the need for post-translational proteolytic processing into the three-chain form of natural CVF. These results will allow detailed studies of the structure/function relationship of CVF and C3 (23Wehrhahn D. Meiling K. Fritzinger D.C. Bredehorst R. Andrä J. Vogel C.-W. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 94Crossref Google Scholar, 24Fritzinger D.C. Hew B.E. Wehrhahn D. Vogel C.-W. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 199Google Scholar) as well as the generation of human C3 derivatives with CVF-like functions (“humanized CVF”) as potential agents for therapeutic complement depletion (25Hew B.E. Thorne M. Fritzinger D.C. Vogel C.-W. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 244-245Google Scholar). In addition, the ability to generate a functionally active CVF molecule by recombinant means will ensure continued availability of CVF as a research reagent to deplete complement. This is important because the Indian cobra Naja naja and related Asian cobras of the genus Naja 2The various Asian cobras had formerly been classified as subspecies of the Indian cobra N. naja (e.g., N. naja kaouthia). They have been reclassified as species (e.g. N. kaouthia) (55Wüster W. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).2The various Asian cobras had formerly been classified as subspecies of the Indian cobra N. naja (e.g., N. naja kaouthia). They have been reclassified as species (e.g. N. kaouthia) (55Wüster W. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). are on the list of endangered species, and cobra venom as the source of natural CVF will be increasingly difficult or impossible to obtain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—CVF was purified from live Naja kaouthia venom (Miami Serpentarium Laboratory; Punta Gorda, FL) as described (22Vogel C.-W. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 73: 203-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Human complement components C3, C5, factor B, and factor D were either purified as described previously (26Hammer C.H. Wirtz G.H. Renfer L. Gresham H.D. Tack B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3995-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or obtained from Advanced Research Technologies (San Diego). A polyclonal antiserum to CVF was prepared in a goat (17Vogel C.-W. Smith C.A. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 3235-3241PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs.Construction of a Full-length Pro-CVF cDNA Clone—The CVF venom gland library cDNA clones (CVF65, CVF72, and pCVF106) used for the construction of a full-length CVF cDNA were described previously (19Fritzinger D.C. Bredehorst R. Vogel C.-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12775-12779Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). λgt11 clone CVF65 was digested with EcoRI, and the resulting 2.5-kb fragment spanning bp 849–3350 of the CVF cDNA sequence was subcloned into pUCl8, resulting in the plasmid clone pCVF65/9. λgt11 clone CVF72 was digested with SacI and KpnI. The resulting 4-kb fragment (containing ∼2 kb of CVF sequence at the 5′-end) was ligated into pUC18, resulting in the plasmid construct pCVF72. The plasmid clones pCVF65/9 and pCVF106 were both digested with SalI and MunI. The proper fragments were separated and ligated, resulting in the plasmid construct pCVF-MKI. pCVF-MKI was digested with BamHI and NotI and dephosphorylated using calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. The 4.3-kb fragment spanning from bp 1711 to the 3′-end of the CVF sequence was isolated. pCVF72 was digested with DraI and BamHI. The proper fragment was isolated and ligated to the pCVF-MK1 fragment. An ATP concentration of 5 mm was used in the ligation reaction to prevent dimerization and formation of concatamers. The ligation product was digested with SalI and subcloned into a NotI/SalI-precut pSportl vector (Invitrogen), resulting in the vector pCVF-FL3. A 1-kb remainder of λgt11 sequence at the CVF 5′-end was removed by partial digestion with EcoRI. The CVF cDNA has three internal EcoRI sites, so this was achieved by digestion with a high amount of enzyme at room temperature for a short time (30 s) followed by ligase-mediated recircularization. Because a unique SmaI site was removed along with the desired deletion of the λgt11 sequence, the background of untruncated plasmids was reduced by linearization with SmaI prior to transformation into Escherichia coli. Plasmid DNA isolated from a polyclonal culture was linearized by digestion with KpnI. Plasmids with a correct length of 10 kb were isolated, religated, and again transformed into E. coli. Monoclonal cultures were screened by plasmid minipreparation, restriction mapping, and T7 sequencing. A correct clone was obtained and named pCVF-FL3Δ. The full-length pro-CVF cDNA can be isolated from the plasmid by digestion with NotI and Kpn2I. The clone was completely resequenced. All cloning operations were done by standard methods (27Sambrook J. Fritsch T. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Construction of Baculovirus Expression Transfer Vector for Pro-CVF—pCVF-FL3Δ was digested with NotI and Kpn2I. The CVF fragment was isolated and ligated into the pVL1393 vector (Pharmingen), which was digested with XmaI and EagI and dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. Transfer vector DNA was purified by a cesium chloride gradient. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding full-length pro-CVF were generated using the BaculoGold™ transfection kit (Pharmingen). Monoclonal virus strains were isolated by at least two rounds of plaque purification.Construction of Plasmids for Expression of Pro-CVF in Drosophila S2 Cells—To express pro-CVF in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells (Invitrogen) using the native CVF signal sequence, the plasmid pCVF-FL3Δ was cut with KpnI and NotI. The two fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the 6-kb fragment was isolated from the gel using a QiaQuick™ gel extraction column (Qiagen). This was then ligated into the vector pMT/V5-HisA (Invitrogen) that had been cut with the same enzymes. After confirmation of the junction sequences, the plasmid was stably transfected into Drosophila S2 cells using the calcium phosphate method (28Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar) with 25 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen) as a selection agent.To express pro-CVF in S2 cells using the Drosophila Bip signal sequence from the Drosophila expression vector pMT-Bip/V5-HisA (29Kirkpatrick R.B. Ganguly S. Angelichio M. Griego S. Shatzman A. Silverman C. Rosenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19800-19805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we engineered a new KpnI site in pMT-Bip/V5-HisA, using the GeneTailor™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Invitrogen and following the manufacturer's directions. Primers used for mutagenesis were pMT-Bip-Kpn-F1 (TTGTTGGCCTCTCGCTCGGGGTACCTCCATGGCCCG) and pMT-Bip-Kpn-R1 (CCCGAGCGAGAGGCCAACAAAGGCCACGAC). The signal sequence of natural CVF was removed and an in-frame KpnI site engineered (30Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar), using the primers CVF-KpnSig-R1 (GGGGTACCCTACACCCTCATC) and CVFK-F1 (CCTTCCACTTCCTCTCCA). After the PCR, the product was purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit. It was then cut with KpnI and PmlI and ligated into pCVF-FL3Δ that had been cut with the same enzymes. The 6-kb Kpn-NotI CVF fragment was then transferred into the S2 expression vector as described above.Expression and Purification of Recombinant CVF—CVF was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells (ATCC CRL 1711; Manassas, VA) maintained in Insect Xpress™ medium (BioWhittaker) containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate (Invitrogen) and 0.1% (v/v) Pluronic™ F-68 (Invitrogen). For large scale expression, a 500-ml cell suspension (cell density of 2 × 106 cells/ml) was infected at 27 °C with the recombinant baculovirus strain at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10. When cells were 60% lysed (3.5–4 days after infection), the culture supernatant was collected by centrifugation, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Merck) was added to a final concentration of 2 mm. The supernatant was cooled to 4 °C, diluted 1:1 with water, adjusted to pH 7.2, and filtered through a 0.45-μm cellulose acetate membrane (Sartorius). This solution was applied directly to a Highload-S™ cation exchange column (110 × 15 mm) (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 4.3 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Recombinant CVF 3The term recombinant CVF collectively refers to any or all three forms of pro-CVF (single-chain pro-CVF, C3-like two-chain pro-CVF, C3b-like two-chain pro-CVF). was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–300 mm). Fractions containing CVF were identified by immunoblot analysis. The pooled fractions were applied directly to a Highload-Q™ anion exchange column (5 × 100 mm) (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 4.3 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). CVF was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–500 mm). Fractions containing CVF, identified by immunoblot analysis, were pooled, concentrated, and diafiltered against Veronal-buffered saline (3.5 mm 5,5-diethylbarbituric acid, 143 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm CaCl2) (VBS2+) using Centriplus™-100 centrifugal filtration units (100,000 molecular mass cutoff) (Amicon) and stored at -20 °C.For pro-CVF expression in Drosophila S2 cells, the stably transformed S2 cell cultures were first expanded in serum-free medium (Invitrogen) in the presence of 25 μg/ml blasticidin into 150-cm2 flasks. Once these cultures reached a cell density of 5 × 106 cells/ml, they were expanded into Spinner flasks in serum-free medium at a final density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in the absence of blasticidin. Cell growth was monitored, and serum-free medium added to maintain a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml until the final culture volume reached 1 liter. Cells were then allowed to grow until they reached a final density of 5 × 106 cells/ml. At this point, the production of pro-CVF was induced by the addition of copper sulfate to a final concentration of 25 μm. After induction, the culture was maintained for 4–5 days, and the pro-CVF purified as described above.In Vitro Proteolytic Processing of Single-chain Pro-CVF in Sf9 Culture Supernatants—At the 4th day of infection, the culture supernatant was collected by centrifugation, diluted 1:1 with deionized water, adjusted to pH 7.0, and filtered through a 0.2-μm cellulose acetate membrane (Sartorius) into a sterile bottle. This solution was incubated at 4 °C for 4 days in the dark. Proteolytically processed recombinant pro-CVF was purified as described for the unprocessed molecule.Glycosylation Analysis—Glycosylation of recombinant CVF was analyzed by lectin blotting using the DIG Glycan Differentiation Kit (Roche Applied Science). To investigate the effect of inhibiting glycosylation on the secretion of recombinant CVF, Sf9 cells were grown in the presence of 5 μg/ml tunicamycin (Calbiochem). At the times indicated, cells and supernatants were harvested and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions with subsequent blotting and development using anti-CVF antiserum.Complement Consumption Assay—The assay is based on the anti-complementary activity of CVF (31Cochrane C.G.

Briefly, 10 μl of normal guinea pig serum (Advanced Research Technologies) was added to a 10-μl sample containing CVF or pro-CVF in VBS2+ buffer. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the mixture was diluted with 100 μl of VBS2+ containing 0.1% gelatin, and 30 μl of sensitized sheep erythrocytes (Advanced Research Technologies) in gelatin containing VBS2+ buffer at a cell concentration of 5 × 108 cells/ml was added and incubated at 37 °C in a shaking water bath until lysis was apparent in control samples.

It was performed as described previously (25Hew B.E. Thorne M. Fritzinger D.C. Vogel C.-W. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 244-245Google Scholar). Briefly, a 20-μl sample containing CVF or pro-CVF was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 μl of normal guinea pig serum and 20 μl of a suspension of guinea pig erythrocytes (HemoStat Laboratories; Dixon, CA) in gelatin containing VBS2+ at a cell concentration of 5 × 108 cells/ml. Controls included heat-inactivated guinea pig serum, guinea pig serum supplemented with 2.5 mm Mg-EGTA, and guinea pig serum supplemented with 10 mm EDTA.

https://openalex.org/W2110039717,"The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway is known to be involved in a wide range of biological events, including development, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, and oncogenesis. The TGF-β signal is mediated by ligand binding to the type II receptor, leading to the recruitment and activation of the type I receptor, and subsequent activation of a family of intracellular signal transducing proteins called Smads. Here we report a regulatory role for casein kinase Iϵ (CKIϵ) in the TGF-β signaling cascade. We find that CKIϵ binds to all Smads and the cytoplasmic domains of the type I and type II receptors both in vitro and in vivo. The interaction of CKIϵ with the type I and type II receptors is independent of TGF-β stimulation, whereas the CKIϵ/Smad interaction is transiently disrupted by ligand treatment. Additionally, CKIϵ is able to phosphorylate the receptor-activated Smads (Smads 1–3 and 5) and the type II receptor in vitro. Transcriptional reporter assays reveal that transient overexpression of wild type CKIϵ dramatically reduces basal reporter activity but enhances TGF-β-stimulated transcription. Furthermore, overexpression of a kinase-dead mutant of CKIϵ inhibits both basal and ligand-induced transcription, whereas inhibition of endogenous CKI catalytic activity with IC261 blocks only TGF-β-stimulated reporter activity. Finally, knocking down CKIϵ protein levels results in a significant increase in basal and TGF-β-induced transcription. These results suggest that CKIϵ plays a ligand-dependent, differential, and dual regulatory role within the TGF-β signaling pathway.

This pathway begins its regulatory functions at the earliest stages of development and acts to coordinate the complex mechanisms of cellular differentiation that will ultimately result in a mature organism. The power that this signal transduction pathway wields over cellular fate is necessary for its ability to regulate the critical events of development and differentiation. However, when regulatory controls are lost, the result is usually uncontrolled growth and proliferation. Therefore, it is not surprising that mutations within the TGF-β pathway have been implicated in a wide range of clinically observed pathological abnormalities (1Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar, 2Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat.

Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 763-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The TGF-β superfamily of ligands includes bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), activins, and TGF-βs. This signaling pathway is a relatively simple cascade that consists of the ligand, the type I and type II receptors, and the cytoplasmic signal transducers called Smads (5Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 7Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The type I and type II receptors are serine/threonine kinases that, upon ligand binding, form a heterotetrameric complex in which the constitutively active type II receptor phosphorylates the GS domain of the type I receptor resulting in catalytic activation. Once activated, the type I receptor then transiently associates with and phosphorylates the receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads) at their two most carboxyl-terminal serine residues. Smads consist of two highly conserved Mad homology domains, termed MH1 and MH2, connected by a relatively divergent linker region. The MH1 domain is involved in DNA binding, whereas the MH2 domain is important for protein/protein interactions. Furthermore, in the absence of ligand the MH1 and MH2 domains can interact to form an inhibitory conformation that is relieved by type I receptor phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of Smads 2 and 3 by the activated TGF-β and activin type I receptors or Smads 1, 5, and 8 by the activated BMP type I receptors leads to R-Smad association with the co-Smad, Smad 4. This ligand-induced R-Smad-co-Smad heteromeric complex can then translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene transcription usually through additional associations with coactivators such as p300/CBP, corepressors such as c-Ski, or other transcription factors such as AP-1 (7Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The casein kinase I (CKI) family consists of seven known isoforms (α, β, γ1, γ2, γ3, δ, and ϵ) that possess a highly homologous serine/threonine kinase domain and a divergent and variable length carboxyl-terminal tail (8Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 9Vielhaber E. Virshup D.M. IUBMB Life. 2001; 51: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These kinases have been implicated in a wide range of cellular functions, including vesicular trafficking, DNA damage repair, cell cycle progression, and cytokinesis (8Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Additionally, the enormous amount of research conducted on the various CKI isoforms has yielded invaluable information regarding kinase activity, substrate specificity, tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and catalytic regulation (8Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the identification and characterization of a CKI consensus recognition sequence has been an area of particular interest (8Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell.

However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that one universal canonical recognition sequence probably does not exist, and thus identifying potential CKI phosphorylation sites within a given substrate remains a laborious endeavor. The majority of the research conducted to date on the CKI family has centered primarily on characterizing its biochemical properties and cellular functions. However, recently there have been significant developments in the CKI field, and these once obscure kinases have become important players in the area of signal transduction. This idea is clearly supported by the numerous papers that have been published in the last several years that show a significant role for CKIϵ and CKIδ in the circadian rhythms of mammals (13Lowrey P.L.

Given the fact that many CKI family members have been found to play important regulatory functions in diverse signaling pathways, it is not surprising that we have identified CKIϵ as a Smad3-interacting protein. Our functional characterization of this interaction has revealed that CKIϵ is able to bind to Smads and TGF-β receptors in vitro and in vivo. We have also found that CKIϵ transient overexpression represses basal activity but enhances ligand-stimulated activity of a TGF-β-regulated transcriptional reporter. Furthermore, we have observed that ectopic expression of a kinase-deficient mutant of CKIϵ causes a dominant negative phenotype that is illustrated by its inhibition of both basal and ligand-induced reporter activity. Additionally, inhibition of endogenous CKI kinase activity using a highly specific inhibitor causes no change in basal reporter activity but dramatically blocks TGF-β-mediated transcription. Finally, our findings show that depletion of CKIϵ by siRNA leads to increased Smad3 protein levels and consequently an increase in both basal and TGF-β-stimulated transcriptional reporter activity. These data provide the first evidence demonstrating that CKIϵ plays a critical regulatory role within the TGF-β signaling cascade. Plasmids—The GST fusion constructs of Smads 1–5 and Smad3N, Smad3NL, Smad3C, and Smad3CL have been described previously (42Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The GST fusion construct of the cytoplasmic domain of the TGF-β type I has been described previously (43.Bassing, C. H., Yingling, J. M., Howe, D. J., Wang, T., He, W. W., Gustafson, M. L., Shah, P., Donahue, P., and Wang, X.-F. (1994) 263, 87–89Google Scholar). The GST fusion construct of the TGF-β type II receptor was generated by digesting the full-length cDNA with HpaI and EcoRI and then subcloning the fragment containing the cytoplasmic domain into the SmaI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-3X. The mammalian expression vectors pRK5-Smad2-FLAG, pRK5-Smad-3-FLAG, and pRK5-Smad4-FLAG were provided by Dr. Rik Derynck. The pRc-CKIϵ-HA construct was a gift from Dr. David Virshup. pcDNA3-CKIϵ was generated by PCR using pRc-CKIϵ-HA as template and the following primers: CKIϵ-F 5′-GGG AAG CTT AGC GGC CGC ATG GAG CTA CGT GTG GGG AAC AAG-3′, CKIϵ-R 5′-GCT CTA GAC TCA CTT CCC GAG ATG GTC AAA TGG C-3′. The CKIϵ PCR product was digested with HindIII and XbaI, subcloned into pBKS, and sequenced to confirm the absence of mutations. CKIϵ was then subcloned into the NotI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). CKIϵ-GST was constructed by subcloning the CKIϵ PCR product from pBKS into the NotI site of pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences), oriented, and sequenced to confirm in-frame fusion with GST. The pGEX-4T-3-CKIϵ construct was used to make carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants by introducing stop codons at various points within the tail region. The stop codons were introduced using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene. The primer sequences used to generate these mutations are identical to those described previously (44Gietzen K.F. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32063-32070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-CKIϵ kinase-dead (KD) was generated by mutating lysine 38 to arginine using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene. The following primer sequences were used for mutagenesis: CKIϵK38R-F 5′-GGA AGT CGC CAT CAG GCT GGA GTG TGT G-3′ and CKIϵK38R-R 5′-CAC ACA CTC CAG CCT GAT GGC GAC TTC C-3′. Isolated clones were sequenced to confirm the correct mutation. Cell Culture and Generation of Stable CKIϵ Overexpressing Cell Lines—HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HaCaT cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HaCaT cells stably overexpressing HA-tagged CKIϵ were generated using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen) to transfect pRc-CKIϵ-HA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following transfection, selection media containing 400 μg/ml G418 was added, and individual clones were then isolated and analyzed by Western blot using anti-CKIϵ (Transduction Laboratories). Positive clones were maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids, antibiotics, and 200 μg/ml G418 and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. GST Pulldown Assays—Smad-GST, receptor-GST, or CKIϵ-GST fusion proteins were bacterially expressed, and the bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in MTPBS (4 mm Na2HPO4, 16 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitors, pH 7.3), and lysed by sonication. The bacterial lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated for 2–4 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The Sepharose beads containing bound GST fusion proteins were washed 4× with lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining in order to determine relative yields. pcDNA3-CKIϵ, pRK5-Smad2, pRK5-Smad3, and pRK5-Smad4 were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine using the Promega TnT® Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System according to the manufacturer's protocol. An equal amount of purified GST fusion protein and a constant volume of reticulocyte lysate containing 35S-labeled protein were diluted together in 400 μl of ULB+ (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitors, pH 7.5) and incubated for 2–4 h at 4 °C. The glutathione-Sepharose beads with bound GST fusions proteins were then washed 5× with binding buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE gels, dried, and analyzed for the presence of 35S-labeled proteins by autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—HaCaT cells or HaCaT cells stably overexpressing HA-CKIϵ were grown to 50–60% confluence on 10-cm plates under the culturing conditions described above and then treated with 100 pm TGF-β for variable lengths of time. TGF-β-treated and -untreated cells were washed 2× with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, pelleted, and lysed with ULB+ (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium molybdate, protease inhibitors, pH 7.5). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were quantified using the modified Bradford protein assay kit from Bio-Rad. 400–600 μg of protein was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with either anti-TGF-β type I receptor (R-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-TGF-β type II receptor (L-21, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-Smad2/3 (N-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by incubation with a 50:50 mixture of protein A-Sepharose/protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed 4× with ULB+, and the precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in sample loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and analyzed for the presence of CKIϵ by immunoblotting with anti-CKIϵ (Transduction Laboratories). Blots were then stripped and reprobed using anti-Smad1/2/3 (H-2 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to analyze the efficiency of the Smad2/3 immunoprecipitation. CKIϵ in Vitro Kinase Assays—Smad-GST, receptor-GST, or CKIϵ-GST fusion proteins were bacterially expressed, and the bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in MTPBS (4 mm Na2HPO4, 16 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitors, pH 7.3), and lysed by sonication. The bacterial lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated for 2–4 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The Sepharose beads containing bound GST fusion proteins were washed four times with lysis buffer and then incubated for 6–8 h in elution buffer (50 mm Tris, 25 mm glutathione, pH 8.0) at 4 °C. The eluted proteins were quantified using a modified Bradford protein assay from Bio-Rad and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining to visualize the quality of the purified protein. 2 μg of purified and eluted substrate protein or 1 μg of α-casein (Sigma) was combined with 250 ng of purified and eluted GST-CKIϵ-319 in 20 μl of 2× kinase buffer (60 mm HEPES, 14 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5). The volume was adjusted to 38.5 μl using sterile H2O, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 1.5 μl of ATP (1 μl of 1 mm cold ATP and 0.5 μlof[γ-32P]ATP). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by the addition of 4× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. 50% of each kinase reaction was separated on an SDS-PAGE gel, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. Transcriptional Reporter Assays—The 3TP-Lux reporter construct was provided by Dr. Joan Massagué, and the SBE-Lux reporter was constructed in our laboratory and has been described previously (45Liberati N.T. Moniwa M. Borton A.J. Davie J.R. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22595-22603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 250–300 × 103 HepG2 cells/well were plated into 6-well plates and cultured as described above for 24 h or until an approximate confluence of 30–40% was reached. By using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method, 2 μg of total DNA per well was transiently transfected (this included 0.250 μg/well of the indicated reporter construct and 0.125 μg/well of a CMV-β-galactosidase construct) for 12–16 h. Cells were then washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, allowed to recover for 6–12 h in fresh media, and then incubated for an additional 18–24 h with or without 100 pm TGF-β. Following TGF-β treatment, cells were lysed, and supernatants were analyzed for luciferase activity using a luminometer. Luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. The luciferase assays in which IC261 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to inhibit the kinase activity of CKIϵ were performed in HepG2 cells that had been transiently transfected with either SBE-Lux or 3TP-Lux reporters exactly as described above. IC261 was dissolved in Me2SO to create a stock concentration of 50 mm, and following transfection the cells were pretreated for at least 2 h with a range of IC261 concentrations (10, 20, and 40 μm) prior to the addition of 100 pm TGF-β. CKIϵ Transient Knockdown Experiments—HepG2 cells were plated into 10-cm plates, cultured as described above, and grown to 50–60% confluence. Prior to transfection, cells were washed one time with serum-free DMEM, and then 3.6 ml of serum-free media was added to each plate. The sequence of the siRNA oligo used in this study was designed from the human CKIϵ coding region and has been described previously (26Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.-H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). The siRNA oligo was purchased in the duplexed, desalted, 2′-deprotected, and purified form from Dharmacon. 1.44 nmol of the siRNA duplex was diluted in 1200 μl of serum-free DMEM, whereas 72 μl of OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) was diluted separately in 288 μl of serum-free DMEM and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The diluted OligofectAMINE was added to the diluted siRNA and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The siRNA/OligofectAMINE complex mixture was further diluted to 2.4 ml after 20 min using serum-free DMEM, and the entire volume was then added to the 10-cm plate. Transfection was terminated after 4 h by the addition of 6 ml of DMEM containing 20% serum and cultured overnight. The transfected HepG2 cells were then split, and the entire procedure was repeated twice. Following the third transfection, the HepG2 cells were seeded into 6-well plates to test for changes in TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activity using the SBE-Lux and 3TP-Lux transcriptional reporter constructs exactly as described above. Following these luciferase assays, the remaining supernatants from each related condition were pooled, and protein concentrations were determined by using the modified Bradford protein assay kit from Bio-Rad. An equal amount of protein (40 μg for CKIϵ, Smad3, and β-catenin) from each siRNA condition was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blotted with either anti-CKIϵ (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Smad1/2/3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-β-catenin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). CKIϵ Physically Interacts with Smads and TGF-β Receptors in Vitro—The relatively simplistic mechanism by which TGF-β regulates a large and diverse set of cellular events raises the possibility that there may be additional proteins that play an important role in modulating the activity of this pathway. Therefore, we undertook the task of identifying pathway interactors and effectors by carrying out a yeast two-hybrid screen using Smad3 as bait as described previously (45Liberati N.T. Moniwa M. Borton A.J. Davie J.R. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22595-22603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 46Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The results of this screen have led to the identification of many potential Smad3-interacting proteins, including the CKIγ2 isoform. To confirm the yeast two-hybrid results, we first analyzed several CKI isoforms for their ability to interact directly with Smad3. In vitro binding assays were performed in which [35S]-methionine-labeled CKIα, CKIδ, CKIϵ, and CKIγ2 were each independently incubated with purified GST-fused full-length Smad proteins. As shown in Fig. 1B, CKIϵ is able to interact strongly not only with Smad3 but also with Smads1, -2, and -4, whereas interaction with Smad5 is extremely weak. The in vitro interactions of CKIα and CKIδ with purified Smad proteins are relatively weak, whereas binding of full-length CKIγ2 to Smads is virtually undetectable (data not shown). Furthermore, by using Smad3 deletion mutants fused to GST and depicted in Fig. 1A, we found that CKIϵ interacts most strongly with the MH2 domain. This is consistent with previous findings that have shown the MH2 domain of the R-Smads to be important in protein/protein interactions (7Massague J. Wotton D.

https://openalex.org/W2083567979,"Msx2 promotes osteogenic lineage allocation from mesenchymal progenitors but inhibits terminal differentiation demarcated by osteocalcin (OC) gene expression. Msx2 inhibits OC expression by targeting the fibroblast growth factor responsive element (OCFRE), a 42-bp DNA domain in the OC gene bound by the Msx2 interacting nuclear target protein (MINT) and Runx2/Cbfa1. To better understand Msx2 regulation of the OCFRE, we have studied functional interactions between MINT and Runx2, a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation. In MC3T3E1 osteoblasts (with endogenous Runx2 and FGFR2), MINT augments transcription driven by the OCFRE that is further enhanced by FGF2 treatment. OCFRE regulation can be reconstituted in the naïve CV1 fibroblast cell background. In CV1 cells, MINT synergizes with Runx2 to enhance OCFRE activity in the presence of activated FGFR2. The RNA recognition motif domain of MINT (which binds the OCFRE) is required. Runx2 structural studies reveal that synergy with MINT uniquely requires Runx2 activation domain 3. In confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, MINT adopts a reticular nuclear matrix distribution that overlaps transcriptionally active osteoblast chromatin, extensively co-localizing with the phosphorylated RNA polymerase II meshwork. MINT only partially co-localizes with Runx2; however, co-localization is enhanced 2.5-fold by FGF2 stimulation. Msx2 abrogates Runx2-MINT OCFRE activation, and MINT-directed RNA interference reduces endogenous OC expression. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, Msx2 selectively inhibits Runx2 binding to OC chromatin. Thus, MINT enhances Runx2 activation of multiprotein complexes assembled by the OCFRE.

Bone formation arises via two overlapping yet distinct mechanisms (1Olsen B.R. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Google Scholar). Endochondral ossification occurs via the calcification and vascularization of an initial cartilaginous template, best exemplified by long bone development and fracture repair. Non-endochondral ossification occurs during development in the flat bones of the skull, in teeth, and in the lateral portion of the clavicles. Direct bone deposition occurs in type I collagen-based extracellular matrix; no cartilage template precedes bone deposition. Both in vivo and in cell culture models, a characteristic gene expression program is elaborated as osteoblasts differentiate and mature from osteoprogenitors (2Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 424-442Google Scholar, 3Yamaguchi A. Komori T. Suda T. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 393-411Google Scholar, 4Canalis E. Economides A.N. Gazzerro E. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 218-235Google Scholar). Although transcription factors crucial to bone development (Runx2/Cbfa1, CBF-β, Msx2, Msx1, Dlx5, Alx4, Osx, and Sox9) and metabolic/endocrine regulation (multiple nuclear receptors, Runx2/Cbfa1) have been identified, our understanding of the molecular details of stage-specific osteoblast gene expression is rudimentary (5Karsenty G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2731-2733Google Scholar). “Cross-talk” between these factors occurs in the osteoblast nucleus; an integrative model is lacking and sorely needed to better address unmet clinical needs in metabolic bone disease, craniofacial dysmorphias, and hetero-topic ossification (6Karsenty G. Nature. 2003; 423: 316-318Google Scholar, 7Demer L.L. Tintut Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1739-1743Google Scholar). The osteoblast homeodomain protein Msx2 plays an important role in bone formation and the temporospatial timing of osteoblast differentiation (8Cohen Jr., M.M. J. Craniofac. Genet. Dev. Biol. 2000; 20: 19-25Google Scholar). Maas and colleagues have disrupted the mouse Msx2 gene by homologous recombination and identified severe deficiencies in both intramembranous and endochondral bone formation (9Satokata I. Ma L. Ohshima H. Bei M. Woo I. Nishizawa K. Maeda T. Takano Y. Uchiyama M. Heaney S. Peters H. Tang Z. Maxson R. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 391-395Google Scholar). Indeed, in the simultaneous absence of Msx2 and Msx1, a highly related and partially redundant Msx gene family member, craniofacial skeletal development is completely abrogated (9Satokata I. Ma L. Ohshima H. Bei M. Woo I. Nishizawa K. Maeda T. Takano Y. Uchiyama M. Heaney S. Peters H. Tang Z. Maxson R. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 391-395Google Scholar). In humans, Wilkie and colleagues demonstrated that haploinsufficiency for Msx2 function results in substantial calvarial mineralization defects; this manifests either as hereditary parietal foramina (10Wilkie A.O. Tang Z. Elanko N. Walsh S. Twigg S.R. Hurst J.A. Wall S.A. Chrzanowska K.H. Maxson Jr., R.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 387-390Google Scholar) or as part of a cleidocranial dysplasia syndrome (11Garcia-Minaur S. Mavrogiannis L.A. Rannan-Eliya S.V. Hendry M.A. Liston W.A. Porteous M.E. Wilkie A.O. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 11: 892-895Google Scholar). Conversely, Msx2(P148H), a gain-of-function variant of Msx2, causes craniosynostosis, characterized by the precocious mineralization and differentiation of calvarial osteoblasts in cranial sutures. Recent studies in our lab have shown that Msx2 can promote the osteogenic differentiation of vascular progenitors, promoting osteoblast lineage allocation while inhibiting adipogenic potential (12Cheng S.L. Shao J.S. Charlton-Kachigian N. Loewy A.P. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45969-45977Google Scholar). In this setting, the craniosynostosis variant Msx2(P148H) is much more active than wild-type Msx2 in promoting osteogenic differentiation in synergy with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (12Cheng S.L. Shao J.S. Charlton-Kachigian N. Loewy A.P. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45969-45977Google Scholar). However, Msx2 also clearly functions to delay the timing of osteoblast terminal differentiation. This is best exemplified by Msx2-dependent suppression of the osteocalcin (OC) 1The abbreviations used are: OC, osteocalcin; OPN, osteopontin; MINT, Msx2 interacting nuclear target; RRM, RNA recognition motif; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; OCFRE, osteocalcin FGF response element; TAF, transcriptional activation function; RNAP IIo, RNA polymerase II with phosphorylated large subunit C terminal domain; CMV, cytomegalovirus; NMTS, nuclear matrix targeting sequence; AD3, activation domain 3; RT, reverse transcription; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered physiological saline; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ROS, rat osteosarcoma cells; RNAi, RNA interference; G4, yeast gal 4 DNA binding domain; Osx, osterix; SFG-LacZ, retrovirus expressing β-galactosidase; SFG-Msx2, retrovirus expressing Msx2; Tbdn100, Tubedown 100. 1The abbreviations used are: OC, osteocalcin; OPN, osteopontin; MINT, Msx2 interacting nuclear target; RRM, RNA recognition motif; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; OCFRE, osteocalcin FGF response element; TAF, transcriptional activation function; RNAP IIo, RNA polymerase II with phosphorylated large subunit C terminal domain; CMV, cytomegalovirus; NMTS, nuclear matrix targeting sequence; AD3, activation domain 3; RT, reverse transcription; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered physiological saline; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ROS, rat osteosarcoma cells; RNAi, RNA interference; G4, yeast gal 4 DNA binding domain; Osx, osterix; SFG-LacZ, retrovirus expressing β-galactosidase; SFG-Msx2, retrovirus expressing Msx2; Tbdn100, Tubedown 100. gene in teeth and calvarial osteoblasts (13Hoffmann H.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29607-29613Google Scholar). During odontogenesis, where stage-specific gene expression programs are spatially resolved, Msx2 and OC are reciprocally expressed (14Bidder M. Latifi T. Towler D.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 609-619Google Scholar). Consistent with this, stable expression of Msx2 in MC3T3E1 calvarial osteoblasts suppresses OC, but not osteopontin (OPN), gene expression (14Bidder M. Latifi T. Towler D.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 609-619Google Scholar). Unlike recent observations demonstrating that activation of early osteogenic differentiation (e.g. alkaline phosphatase expression) is proportional to Msx2 DNA binding activity (12Cheng S.L. Shao J.S. Charlton-Kachigian N. Loewy A.P. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45969-45977Google Scholar), suppression of the late phenotypic marker OC is independent of intrinsic Msx2 DNA binding (15Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Battaile J.T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10451-10462Google Scholar). Inhibitory protein-protein interactions occur in part between Msx2 and DNA-protein complex assembled by the OC promoter region -154 to -113 (16Newberry E.P. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29607-29613Google Scholar, 17Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16360-16368Google Scholar, 18Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Shao J.S. Ornitz D.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37280-37291Google Scholar). Because this element also mediates transcriptional responses to activated FGFR1/FGFR2 receptor tyrosine kinase, we called this region the OCFRE (18Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N.

Waksman G. Ornitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14536-14541Google Scholar). The OCFRE is a 42-bp DNA domain that encompasses recognition cognates for Runx2 and a novel Ku-antigen transcription factor complex (18Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Shao J.S. Ornitz D.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37280-37291Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this GT-rich duplex DNA is also recognized by MINT, a large ∼400-kDa nuclear matrix protein that we first identified by expression cloning using radiolabeled Msx2 (21Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Google Scholar). MINT is a nuclear DNA- (21Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Google Scholar) and RNA- (22Shi Y. Downes M. Xie W. Kao H.Y. Ordentlich P. Tsai C.C. Hon M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1140-1151Google Scholar) binding protein highly expressed in central nervous system, lymphoid tissue, cardiac tissue, and calvarial osteoblasts (21Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Google Scholar, 23Kuroda K. Han H. Tani S. Tanigaki K. Tun T. Furukawa T. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Hamada Y. Toyokuni S. Honjo T. Immunity. 2003; 18: 301-312Google Scholar). GT-rich cognate recognition is conferred by the three N-terminal RRM domains of MINT (21Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Google Scholar). MINT is highly homologous to Drosophilan spen, a transcriptional co-regulatory protein genetically identified as regulating fly head development in concert with Hox homeodomain proteins (24Wiellette E.L. Harding K.W. Mace K.A. Ronshaugen M.R. Wang F.Y. McGinnis W. Development. 1999; 126: 5373-5385Google Scholar) and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling cascades (25Rebay I. Chen F. Hsiao F. Kolodziej P.A. Kuang B.H. Laverty T. Suh C. Voas M. Williams A. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 2000; 154: 695-712Google Scholar). Thus, biochemical and genetic studies place MINT in regulatory pathways under the control of homeodomain transcription factors. Given the above, we sought to characterize the biochemical relationships between MINT, Msx2, and FGFR2-responsive components of the OCFRE. MINT enhances transcription driven by FGFR2 from the OCFRE in MC3T3E1 osteoblasts that possess endogenous Runx2. We identify that Runx2 possesses the FGFR2-activated transactivation function (TAF) in this complex. In the naive CV-1 cell background, we reconstitute FGFR2 and Runx2-dependent activation of the OCFRE. MINT and Runx2 act synergistically to enhance OCFRE activity, but only in the presence of activated FGFR2. This action is dependent upon Runx2 activation domain 3 (AD3) and the MINT RRM domains. By contrast, Msx2 suppresses OCFRE activation by Runx2 and MINT, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) assays reveal that Msx2 displaces Runx2 from OC, but not OPN, chromatin. In confocal microscopy experiments, MINT localizes with phosphorylated RNA Pol II (RNAP IIo), indicating that MINT associates with transcriptionally active chromatin complexes. The limited overlap between MINT and Runx2 is enhanced 2.5-fold by FGF2 stimulation, providing additional evidence that FGF signaling regulates Runx2-dependent transcription. Thus, MINT enhances Runx2 and FGFR2 activation of multiprotein complexes assembled by the OCFRE. Msx2 targets this complex as a mechanism of selective transcriptional inhibition. In osteoblasts, MINT may serve as a nuclear matrix platform that organizes and integrates osteogenic transcriptional responses. Plasmid and Eukaryotic Expression Constructs—One-hybrid experiments were carried out using pFA-CMV to generate fusion proteins with the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain and pFR-LUC as the Gal4-responsive reporter (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Fragments for murine Runx2 (isoform II), murine Ku70 (GenBank™ accession number P12956), murine Ku80 (GenBank™ accession number P13010), and human Tbdn100 (GenBank accession number AY112670) were generated by PCR to introduce BamHI-XbaI linkers and ligated in contiguous open reading frames downstream of the Gal4 DNA binding domain in pFA-CMV. All eukaryotic Runx2 and Msx2 expression plasmids were prepared in pcDNA3 using techniques described previously (16Newberry E.P. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29607-29613Google Scholar). Isoform II of murine Runx2 (528 aa, MASN...; GenBank™ accession number AF005936) was used to reconstitute Runx2 signaling in naïve CV-1 cells. The following C-terminal truncation variants were prepared from Runx2 isoform II: Runx2 (1-412 aa) to remove the Runx2 C-terminal VWRPY repression domain; Runx2 (1-392) to remove the nuclear matrix targeting signal (NMTS); Runx2 (1-312) to remove Activation Domain 3 (AD3) and distal C-terminal sequences, and an internal deletion lacking AD3 in the context of full length Runx2-Runx2 (1-528; Δ308-375). To provide cell-autonomous FGFR2 stimulation, a plasmid coding for constitutively active FGF2 Receptor FGFR2-ROS (26Lorenzi M.V. Horii Y. Yamanaka R. Sakaguchi K. Miki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8956-8961Google Scholar) was used in co-transfection experiments. The construction and characterization of OCFRE-LUC has been detailed previously (18Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Shao J.S. Ornitz D.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37280-37291Google Scholar). The full-length mouse MINT cDNA was cloned by long PCR of reverse-transcribed mRNA from MC3T3E1 calvarial osteoblasts cells (21Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Google Scholar). In brief, 2 μg of total RNA isolated from logarithmically growing MC3T3E1 cells was used in reverse transcription with Oligo d(T) primer and 200 units of Superscript II RT (Invitrogen). The reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 50 min, then diluted 5-fold with nuclease-free water. For PCR, 5 μL of the diluted RT reactions was used for PCR cloning of full-length MINT transcript. The amplimers used were 5′-CCG TGT CGA CCA TGG GAG ACC GAG ACC TCC GCA-3′ and 5′-GCA TGC GGC CGC TCA CAC CGA GGC AAT GAC AAT CAT-3′. PCR reactions were carried out in 50 μL containing 3.5 units of Expand high fidelity Roche polymerase (Roche Diagnostics). DNA was denatured for 3 min at 94 °C, then biphasic PCR carried out for 25 cycles (15 s at 94 °C, 11 min at 68 °C) to obtain a ∼11-kb amplicon that was subcloned into pGEM (Promega, Madison, WI). DNA sequencing and in vitro transcription-translation (TnT; Promega) of the subcloned fragment was used to verify expression of full-length MINT protein. The pGEM-MINT plasmid was digested with SalI and NotI, and the full-length MINT cDNA was ligated into pCMV-hemagglutinin tag vector (BD Biosciences Clontech) to make CMV-MINT(1-3576), denoted CMV-MINT or MINT. A similar strategy was used to make the variant CMV-MINT(734-3576), denoted CMV-MINT(ΔRRM) or MINT-ΔRRM. This latter variant construct retains the MINT mid region and C-terminal sequence downstream of an initiator Met, retains a subset of the nuclear localization cognates, and localizes to the nucleus (data not shown) but completely lacks intact N-terminal RRM domains (21Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Google Scholar). For fluorescence imaging of Runx2 and Msx2, full-length cDNAs were cloned in a CMV-driven plasmid downstream of the EGFP coding sequence (Living Colors EGFP-C1 plasmid; BD Biosciences Clontech) to create EGFP-Runx2 and EGFP-Msx2, respectively. Cell Lines and Transfection—CV-1 fibroblasts and MC3T3E1 calvarial osteoblasts were grown as described previously (18Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Shao J.S. Ornitz D.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37280-37291Google Scholar). Transfection by lipofection and luciferase reporter assays were carried out as detailed previously (18Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Shao J.S. Ornitz D.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37280-37291Google Scholar), but using 24-well cluster dishes in lieu of 12-well cluster dishes. When indicated, treatment with 10 ng/ml FGF2 (human basic FGF2; BD Biosciences) was initiated 24 h before harvesting cells for luciferase activity. For confocal imaging, MC3T3E1 cells were plated in sterile four-chamber slides (Lab-Tek II; Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) and transfected the next day with 0.2 μg/well EGFP-Runx2 and 0.8 μg/well CMV-MINT plasmids using Superfect Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After 3 h, transfection mix was removed, cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and added fresh 1% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 24 h, medium was changed again and half of the wells were treated with freshly prepared human FGF2 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle in 1% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 18 h. Immunostaining—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and treated with ammonium chloride to neutralize unspecific cross-linking. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for an additional 30 min. The rabbit anti-MINT “R1β” primary antibody against the central Msx2 interacting domain (21Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10678-10690Google Scholar) was then added at a 1:100 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin-PBS for 1-4 h at room temperature, mixing in an orbital shaker. Cells were washed three times for 15 min each with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Secondary Cy3-conjugated or Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:400) was then added in 1% bovine serum albumin-PBS and incubated for at least 1 h at room temperature in an orbital shaker. Cells were washed three times for 15 min each with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS before adding mounting media, placing a 0.15-mm thick coverslip, and sealing with nail polish. Slides were kept in the dark at 4 °C until analyzed. Confocal Microscopy and Deconvolution Analyses—Double-stained cells were imaged using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal inverted microscope using 60× oil lens (numerical aperture, 1.4); an optimal pinhole aperture was used at all times, and at least three z-stack sections (every 0.48 μm) were acquired per cell. To avoid bleed-through, images were acquired using line-by-line strobe scanning and with lasers whose excitation/emission spectra do not overlap: argon (488 nm) for EGFP and red diode (647 nm) for MINT. For Cy3 imaging, green HeNe laser was used (543 nm). All images were deconvolved using the ‘single image constrained iter deconvolution algorithm’ at four iterations, with brightness set at 1.5 (Microtome 7.0; VayTek Software, Fairfield, IA). Images were acquired in grayscale, converted to pseudo-color, and merged using Image Pro-Plus Software (Media Cybernetics, Carlsbad, CA). MINT exhibits a reticular pattern, whereas Runx2 exhibits a partially overlapping punctuate pattern. To determine the proportion of Runx2 punctate foci that also had the signal for MINT, six high quality, deconvolved images were evaluated characterizing several adjacent cells in the field of view. The total numbers of Runx2 foci were digitally counted (n = 491 in cells treated with vehicle; n = 558 in cells treated with FGF2), and two independent observers counted the number of Runx2 foci stained for MINT (scored only if >50% overlap). Data were averaged and presented as the mean ± S.D. percentage of MINT-positive Runx2 foci. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test on raw data sets was used to test statistical significance for differences in the number of Runx2 foci with MINT staining as a function of FGF2 treatment. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—ChIP assays were carried out essentially as described previously (18Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Shao J.S. Ornitz D.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37280-37291Google Scholar), implementing a commercially available polyclonal antibody against the invariant C terminus of Runx2 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). MC3T3E1 cells, which express endogenous Runx2, were stably transfected with either pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-Msx2 as previously detailed. After transfection, cells selected with G418 for 3 days and then processed for chromatin immunoprecipitation essentially as described previously (18Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Shao J.S. Ornitz D.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37280-37291Google Scholar). PCR primers used for OC ChIP were 5′-TAT GAG AGT TGG AGC CCA GTT TAT C-3′ and 5′-CCC TAG AGA CAA GAA CCC TAT GCA T-3′ directed to the mouse OC (OG2) proximal promoter (GenBank accession number U66848). As a control, the osteopontin promoter gene was amplified because it is not affected by Msx2 (14Bidder M. Latifi T. Towler D.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 609-619Google Scholar). Osteopontin genomic PCR primers were 5′-CAC AAA ACC AGA GGA GGA AGT GT-3′ and 5′-GGT CCA GAC AGT CTC CAC CAA-3′ directed against the murine OPN proximal promoter (GenBank™ accession number AY220127.1). PCR amplifications were observed in ethidium-stained polyacrylamide gels, captured digitally, and displayed as light-dark inverted images. In completely independent experimental sets, MC3T3E1 cells were transduced either with SFG-LacZ (control) or SFG-Msx2 retroviral expression vectors, generated and characterized as reported previously (12Cheng S.L. Shao J.S. Charlton-Kachigian N. Loewy A.P. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45969-45977Google Scholar). In this experiment, subconfluent cells were cultured for 1 week in 10% fetal calf serum in α-minimal essential medium with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid. OC ChIP assays were performed and quantified by real-time fluorescence PCR with a GeneAmp 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as detailed previously (18Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Shao J.S. Ornitz D.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37280-37291Google Scholar). Twenty nanograms of processed genomic DNA was used in each PCR reaction. The signal arising from 1 pg of mouse genomic DNA was used as a standard. Data were expressed as the mean picograms ± S.D. of OC genomic DNA equivalents present in the Runx2 immunoprecipitate from four independent cultures/precipitations for both SFG-LacZ and SFG-Msx2 cultures. RNA Interference and Fluorescence RT-PCR Analysis of OC mRNA—The siRNA duplexes against MINT were designed following Tuschl's principles (27Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar). To screen for silencing duplexes, we constructed a reporter MINT fusion protein, MINT-EGFP, by ligating the EGFP cDNA (derived by PCR from LivingColors vector; BD Biosciences Clontech) in a contiguous open reading frame using the unique BglII site in the MINT cDNA. Thus, the 36 C-terminal amino acids of MINT are replaced by EGFP in the MINT-EGFP fusion protein. To screen for active MINT siRNAs, synthetic 21-bp duplexes were cotransfected along MINT-EGFP into MC3T3-E1 cells using Mirrus TransIT-TKO reagent (Mirrus Co., Madison, WI) and evaluated by fluorescence microscopy 24 h later. In parallel, GFP-targeted siRNA was used as a positive control, and luciferase-directed siRNA was used as a negative control. Of the nine MINT-directed siRNA sequences designed and tested, an siRNA duplex against the MINT target sequence AAG CAG CAG GGA TTA TCA ATG reduced EGFP signal comparable with cells transfected with the GFP-targeted siRNA (positive control). This MINT-targeted siRNA duplex was chosen to evaluate the role of MINT on osteocalcin gene expression. In independent duplicate cultures, MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with either 100 nm MINT-targeted siRNA or luciferase-targeted siRNA (negative control). The next day, MC3T3E1 cells were switched to osteogenic differentiation media (10% fetal calf serum in α-minimal essential medium, supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate) and cultured for an additional 10 days. RNA was subsequently extracted, contaminating DNA was removed with DNaseI, and OC, OPN, and β-tubulin mRNA accumulation expression evaluated by fluorescent RT-PCR as described previously (18Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Shao J.S. Ornitz D.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37280-37291Google Scholar, 28Shao J.S. Cheng S.L. Charlton-Kachigian N. Loewy A.P. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50195-50202Google Scholar). The experiment was repeated twice. Runx2 Provides a Major FGF2-Regulated Transactivation Function in the OCFRE Promoter Binding Complex—In the calvarial osteoblast, the OCFRE assembles a multiprotein complex containing Runx2 and a novel Ku-antigen transcription factor complex (18Willis D.M. Loewy A.P. Charlton-Kachigian N. Shao J.S. Ornitz D.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37280-37291Google Scholar). This complex is the target of both FGFR2-dependent activation and Msx2 suppression. To clarify which of these proteins may provide major transactivation functions versus structural function, we analyzed autonomous TAF in Gal4 one-hybrid analyses. As shown in Fig. 1A, among Ku70, Ku80, Tbdn100, and Runx2, only Runx2 exhibited major basal TAF activity when fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain when using the Gal4 responsive luciferase reporter pFR-LUC. Importantly, the Runx2 TAF is regulated by FGFR2 signaling. Co-expression of the constitutively active FGFR2, FGFR2-ROS, enhances Runx2 TAF both in one-hybrid assays (Fig. 1A) and on the OCFRE (Fig. 1B). Because Runx2 provided the major basal and FGF-dependent transactivation function of the OCFRE binding factors, we sought to determine the part of Runx2 that was critical for FGF-dependent activation of the OCFRE. Using a series of C-terminally truncated Runx2 variants and the OCFRE-LUC reporter, we determined that the TAF domain regulated by FGFR2-ROS resides outside of t"
https://openalex.org/W2130484640,"FK506-binding protein 52 (FKBP52) is an immunophilin that possesses peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerase (PPIase) activity and is a component of a subclass of steroid hormone receptor complexes. Several recent studies indicate that immunophilins can regulate neuronal survival and nerve regeneration although the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. To investigate the function of FKBP52 in the nervous system, we employed a yeast two-hybrid strategy using the PPIase domain (domain I) as bait to screen a neonatal rat dorsal root ganglia cDNA expression library. We identified an interaction between FKBP52 domain I and Atox1, a copper-binding metallochaperone. Atox1 interacts with Menkes disease protein and Wilson disease protein (WD) and functions in copper efflux. The interaction between FKBP52 and Atox1 was observed in both glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments and when proteins were ectopically expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and was sensitive to FK506. Interestingly, the FKBP52/Atox1 interaction was enhanced when HEK 293T cells were cultured in copper-supplemented medium and decreased in the presence of the copper chelator, bathocuproine disulfate, suggesting that the interaction is regulated in part by intracellular copper. Overexpression of FKBP52 increased rapid copper efflux in 64Cu-loaded cells, as did the overexpression of WD transporter. Taken together, our present findings suggest that FKBP52 is a component of the copper efflux machinery, and in so, may also promote neuroprotection from copper toxicity.

Maeda Y. Nakao K. Wakim N.G. Duhring J.L. Faber L.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5269-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Analysis of mRNA and protein levels has demonstrated that FKBP52 is widely expressed in mammalian tissues but particularly abundant in the nervous system (2Steiner J.P. Dawson T.M. Fotuhi M.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Structurally, FKBP52 contains an N-terminal peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) domain (domain I), a FKBP-like pseudo domain (domain II), three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains (domain III) that mediate proteinprotein interactions with HSP90, and a C-terminal domain calmodulin-binding site (domain IV) (4Li P.

Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2269-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). FKBP52 has been shown to play important roles in a diverse number of intracellular processes, but much research has focused on its involvement in steroid hormone regulation. FKBP52 regulates the maturation of steroid hormone receptor complexes through interactions between its TPR domain and HSP90 chaperones, which act as scaffolds for receptor assembly and are thought to enhance the affinity of estrogen receptor and the glucocorticoid receptor toward their ligands (1Tai P.K.

The PPIase domain of FKBP52 facilitates translocation of the activated steroid receptors to the nucleus by binding to cytoplasmic dynein (7Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14884-14889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). FKBP52 serves as a transcriptional regulator by repressing the activity of interferon regulatory factor-4 in immune cells (8Mamane Y. Sharma S. Petropoulos L. Lin R. Hiscott J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 129-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and heat-shock factor-1 in HeLa cells (9Guo Y. Guettouche T. Fenna M. Boellmann F. Pratt W.B. Toft D.O.

The Drosophila homolog of FKBP52, dFKBP59, regulates calcium channel activity in photoreceptor cells (12Goel M. Garcia R. Estacion M. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38762-38773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Over the past decade, there has been growing interest to understand the role of immunophilin, or neuroimmunophilins, in the nervous system (13Sharkey J. Butcher S.P. Nature. 1994; 371: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 14Gold B.G. Austin D.R. Storm-Dickerson T. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 176: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). FKBP12 and FKBP52 are up-regulated in regenerating neurons suggesting they may play a protective or regenerative role following injury (15Brecht S. Schwarze K. Waetzig V. Christner C. Heiland S. Fischer G. Sartor K. Herdegen T. Neuroscience. 2003; 120: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additionally, the neuroimmunophilins, FKBP12 and FKBP52, serve as binding proteins for immunosuppressant drugs such as FK506 (16Udina E. Ceballos D. Gold B.G. Navarro X. Exp.

Presently, however, little is known about the mechanisms by which immunophilins regulate cell signaling and neuroprotection. In the present study, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that physically and/or functionally interact with FKBP52. Using a dorsal root ganglia (DRG) expression library and FKBP domain I as “bait” we found that FKBP52 interacts with Atox1, a metallochaperone that transfers copper to Menkes Disease Protein (MNK) and Wilson Disease Protein (WD) (20Hamza I.

Whereas previous studies have shown that immunophilins can effect calcium metabolism and regulate calcium channels (21Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Sabatini D.M. Kaplin A.I. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H.

Materials—Radiochemical pure (>97%) 64Cu was provided by Debbie Sultan (Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University Medical School). Commercially available antibodies were purchased from their respective vendors: anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), and anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The yeast strains EGY48, pEG202, p8op-lacZ, and p2op-lacZ were purchased from Clontech, as part of Matchmaker™ library cloning reagents. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A P1 to P3 neonatal rat DRG cDNA expression library inserted into the DNA activation domain pB42AD vector was kindly provided by Dr. Moses Chao (The Skirball Institute, New York University). Briefly, FKBP52 domain I (amino acids 32–138) containing the entire PPIase domain was inserted into the DNA binding domain of pEG202 vector in the correct reading frame and stable transformants selected in the yeast strain EGY48. To isolate FKBP52 domain I (FKBP52I)-interacting cDNAs, EGY48 expressing pEG202-FKBP52I and p8op-lacZ was transformed with the rat DRG cDNA library and plated on SD/Gal/Raf/-His/-Trp/-Leu/-Ura medium with 8 μg/ml X-gal. Replicate experiments were conducted in the presence of 10 nm FK506 to identify potential gain of function mutants. The blue colonies were streaked three times on the -Trp SD medium to remove non-library containing plasmids. Plasmids from X-gal positive colonies stained blue color were confirmed and DNA was isolated and sequenced using the dideoxy termination method. Expression Vector, Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—pcDNA-V5-FKBP52 (GenBank™ accession number M88279), containing an V5 epitope tag at the C terminus, was purchased from Invitrogen. Full-length FKBP52 or FKBP52 domain I fragment (amino acids 32–152) was subcloned by PCR into pcDNA or pFLAG for mammalian expression, pGEX-6P1 for recombinant expression in DH5α bacteria as a GST fusion protein. pcDNA-WD was a generous gift from Dr. J. Gitlin (Washington University School of Medicine). Transient overexpression was achieved using LipofectAMINE™ method, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids as indicated in the manuscript. After 48 h, cells were lysed in 1% HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. For immunoprecipitation, up to 1.0 mg of total cellular protein was incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, then resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed following SDS-PAGE and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Blots were incubated with primary antibodies, diluted in 5% milk, after which the blots were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Western Lightning; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Metabolic Labeling and Copper Measurements—HEK 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The copper efflux experiment was employed as described by Hamza et al. (23Hamza I. Faisst A. Prohaska J. Chen J. Gruss P. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6848-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For copper efflux studies, 2 × 105 HEK 293T cells were allowed to adhere onto 24 well plate and 8 × 106 cpm of 64Cu cells were premixed with 200 μm copper (chloride salt) and 400 μm l-histidine (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Cells were pulsed with 200 μm64Cu for 1 h as described above, followed by free quick rinses with prewarmed PBS to remove any residual copper and then incubated with prewarmed Opti-MEM alone for several chase period. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, lysed with PBS containing 1% SDS, and analyzed for 64Cu retention by using scintillation counting. To examine the effect of FK506, cells were treated with drug for 2 h before pulse with 200 μm64Cu and for 1 h during pulse. To investigate the function of FKBP52 in the nervous system, we employed a yeast two-hybrid strategy using the PPIase domain (domain I; residues 32–138 fused to the DNA-binding domain of LexA) as bait to screen a neonatal rat DRG expression cDNA library (Fig. 1A). The yeast strain EGY48, containing LexA-responsive reporter genes LEU2 and lacZ under the control of two or eight LexA binding sites, was used to assay the interactions. Among His+ clones, those found to display β-galactosidase activity were rescued from each of these clones and used for retransformation of the reporter strain in combination with pLexA-FKBP52-domain I under higher stringency (p2op-lacZ reporter). Based on AluI restriction enzyme mapping (data not shown) and partial sequence analysis, three cDNA clones were purified and terminally sequenced, two of which were identified by computer-assisted sequence homology search with the GenBank™ data base. One cDNA clone of 503 bp corresponded to the metallochaperone Atox1 (GenBank™ accession number NM053359), a 9-kDa protein involved in transporting copper to the MNK and WD, ATPase 7A/7B transporters (20Hamza I. Schaefer M. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13363-13368Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The second cDNA was identified as the actin capping protein Advillin (24Marks P.W. Arai M. Bandura J.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2129-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the third clone of 0.6 kbp had a unique nucleotide sequence and was not studied further. Both Advillin and Atox1 were identified in multiple clones (Fig. 1B). Replicate screens were conducted in the presence of 10 nm FK506 in an attempt to isolate FKBP52 gain of function effectors, but only the three aforementioned clones were identified (data not shown). To determine the effect of FK506 on the interaction of FKBP52 with Atox1, β-galactosidase activity was measured using increasing concentration of FK506 in liquid culture assays. As shown in Fig. 1C, excess FK506 significantly decreased β-galactosidase activity, consistent with the data indicating that the domain I of FKBP52 mediates the interaction between FKBP52 and Atox1. To confirm the association of FKBP52 domain I with Atox1 in vitro, cell lysates from expressing FLAG-tagged Atox1 HEK 293T cells were incubated with GST, full-length GST-FKBP52 and GST-FKBP52 domain I (Fig. 2A). GST complexes were washed extensively and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody. As indicated in the GST pull-down experiment, Atox1 specifically bound to both GST-FKBP52 and GST-FKBP52 domain I (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the C-terminal domain does not influence the interaction in vitro. To determine the relevance of the Atox1-FKBP52 interaction in mammalian cells, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with full-length V5 epitope-tagged FKBP52 and FLAG epitope-tagged Atox1. Immunoprecipitation of V5-FKBP52 complexes contained Atox1 when analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 2B). This interaction was confirmed by conversely immunoprecipitating FLAG-Atox1 complexes and identifying V5-FKBP52 (data not shown). To assess whether the FKBP52 and Atox1 interaction is dependent on copper, cultured HEK cell expressing FKBP52 and Atox1 were exposed to increasing concentrations of copper-supplemented media or in the presence of the copper chelator, BCS. As shown in Fig. 2C, increasing the extracellular copper resulted in a dose-dependent increased in co-immunoprecipitated Atox1 and FKBP52, and conversely, chelation of extracellular copper with BCS decreased the interaction. These studies suggest that the interaction between FKBP52 and Atox1 may depend on intracellular levels and possible functions as a stress response to increased cellular copper. In both the aforementioned systems, increased amounts of FK506 partially blocked the interaction (Fig. 2D and not shown). Analogous to other immunophilin-binding proteins, including binding of FKBP12 to the ryanodine receptors I and II (25Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Reiken S. Huang F. Marx S.O. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27582-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and FKBP52 binding to the TRP channels (12Goel M. Garcia R. Estacion M. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38762-38773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), Atox1 also contains an LP duet in the C termini (DIDLPNKKVC) that may direct binding to the FKBP domain. We propose that the LP motif may recruit FKBP52 to Atox1 and subsequently assist in the transfer of copper from Atox1 to MNK and WD possibly through a conformation change in the Atox1/MNK (or WD) complex. Normal copper homeostasis is maintained primarily by the liver where dietary copper is excreted to the bile or secreted into circulation as ceruloplasmin for tissue uptake (27Tapiero H. Townsend D.M. Tew K.D. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2003; 57: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Intracellular copper homeostasis is maintained largely by proteins responsible for copper efflux, the copper-transporting MNK and WD, (ATPase7A/7B), as well as Atox1 (20Hamza I. Schaefer M. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13363-13368Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). When cytoplasmic copper concentrations reach potentially toxic levels, MNK and WD redistribute from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane facilitating the efflux of excess copper (20Hamza I. Schaefer M. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13363-13368Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 28Hamza I. Prohaska J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether FKBP52 has an effect on copper efflux, we examined 64Cu retention in HEK 293T cells transfected with FKBP52. Prior to analysis, cells were metabolically labeled with 64Cu tracer and subsequently assessed for 64Cu efflux by measuring the retention of intracellular copper (23Hamza I. Faisst A. Prohaska J. Chen J. Gruss P. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6848-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, copper retention patterns showed a biphasic efflux pattern in which copper efflux is rapid in the first 5 min and slows after 10 min, consistent with reports of Hamza et al. (23Hamza I. Faisst A. Prohaska J. Chen J. Gruss P. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6848-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the rapid copper efflux (<5 min) was potentiated in FKBP52-expressing cells relative to vector-transfected cells and steady state plateau levels remained lower after 20 min following the chase (Fig. 3A). Similar kinetics of 64Cu efflux was noted following transfection with an expression plasmid encoding WD, ATPase7B (Fig. 3B). These data are consistent with a report showing that the overexpression of MNK permit Chinese hamster ovary cells to tolerate highly toxic amounts of copper in their immediate environment (29Camakaris J. Petris M.J. Bailey L. Shen P. Lockhart P. Glover T.W. Barcroft C. Patton J. Mercer J.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2117-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and also suggest that FKBP52 is functionally as well as biochemically linked to the Atox1/MNK (or WD) pathway. 100 nm FK506 pretreatment reproducibly blocked the early phase copper efflux in FKBP52 expressed cells (Fig. 3C). Although FKBP52 could conceivably effect copper by regulating the transfer of copper from apo-Atox1 to Cu-Atox1, studies by Hamza and colleagues (28Hamza I. Prohaska J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) showed that when intracellular copper levels are increased, Cu-MNK (or WD) proteins are rapid redistribution from the trans-Golgi. These data indicate that the transport of copper from Atox1 to MNK (or WD) can be positively regulated and possibly requires the chaperone function of FKBP52. Copper is an essential component of several biological systems but can be toxic if not properly regulated (27Tapiero H. Townsend D.M. Tew K.D. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2003; 57: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). In humans, disruption of the tightly regulated cellular copper homeostasis affects normal tissue development and leads to anemia, neutropenia, cancer, and several neurodegenerative diseases (27Tapiero H. Townsend D.M. Tew K.D. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2003; 57: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Menkes disease is caused by recessive deletions in the ATP7A gene (MNK protein), a phenotype associated with overall copper deficiency due to impaired export of intestinal cells (30Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Wilson disease, in contrast, is caused by copper accumulation predominantly in liver, brain, and kidney as a result of mutants in the ATP7B gene (WD protein) (31Muller T. van de Sluis B. Muller W. Pearson P. Wijmenga C. Eur. J. Med. Res. 1999; 4: 293-297PubMed Google Scholar). The phenotype of Atox1 null mice recapitulate many of the characteristics of MNK and WD deficiencies, including the accumulation of intracellular copper and perinatal lethality (23Hamza I. Faisst A. Prohaska J. Chen J. Gruss P. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6848-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, overexpression of Atox1 in neuronal cells protects cells from oxidative stress and apoptosis by increasing copper efflux. Recent studies also show that forced overexpression of MNK also reduced intracellular copper levels and down-regulated amyloid-β precursor protein expression (32Bellingham S.A. Lahiri D.K. Maloney B. La Fontaine S. Multhaup G. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20378-20386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Human central nervous system diseases associated with defects in metal metabolism include Menkes and Wilson disease (30Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr.

Res. 1999; 4: 293-297PubMed Google Scholar), and many studies now indicate that alterations in metal homeostasis may contribute to Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Prion disease (27Tapiero H. Townsend D.M. Tew K.D. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2003; 57: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2064640405,"Smad proteins are central mediators of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily signaling. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 is also one of the downstream targets required for TGF-β-mediated responses. Although the interplay between the p38 and Smad signaling pathways might allow cells to display diverse patterns of responses to TGF-β, the mechanism of this cross-talk is not well established. We report here that inhibition of the p38α isoform suppressed the ability of Smad3 to mediate TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses. The inhibition of p38 activity blocked TGF-β-mediated phosphorylation of the MSK1 kinase, a substrate of p38 that plays an important role in the remodeling of chromatin. Moreover, we observed that expression of dominant-interfering mutants of MSK1 blocked the binding of Smad3 to the coactivator p300 in response to TGF-β signaling. These data reveal a new mechanism whereby the Smad signaling pathway and the p38 cascade are integrated in the nucleus to activate gene expression.

Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1998; 24: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Binding of TGF-β to the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) triggers heterodimerization and transphosphorylation of the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI). The signal is then propagated through phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 and Smad3, which oligomerize with the common mediator (Co-Smad) Smad4. The complexes then translocate to the nucleus, where they induce the expression of a large number of target genes via direct DNA binding or by association with other DNA-binding proteins (2Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Smads to modulate transcription in response to TGF-β also results from a functional cooperativity with general transcription coactivators such as CBP/p300.A growing body of evidence indicates that Smad signaling alone cannot account for the large diversity of effects of TGF-β, pointing toward other signaling pathways downstream of the TGF-β receptor that may contribute to the specificity of TGF-β action. The best characterized of these are the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 kinases (4Mulder K.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 5Yue J. Mulder K.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 142: 125-131PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of TGF-β on ERK, JNK, and p38 vary in kinetics and magnitude, but the biological consequences of MAPK activations are not totally understood. In addition to TGF-β, the p38 MAPK pathway is activated by different stimuli such as UV, heat shock, or osmotic misbalance that are involved in the mediation of apoptosis (6Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). As highlighted by recent studies, we can distinguish four isoforms of p38 (α, β, γ, and δ) in terms of specificity and physiological relevance (7Hale K.K. Trollinger D. Rihanek M. Manthey C.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4246-4252PubMed Google Scholar). For example, p38β is 180-fold more potent in activating AP1 than p38α (16Pramanik R. Qi X. Borowicz S. Choubey D. Schultz R.M. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4831-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Besides its capacity to phosphorylate and activate transcription factors, p38 activates different kinases such as MSK1, which in turn transduces some downstream effects of p38 (8Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The MSK1 kinase consists of an N-terminal and a C-terminal catalytic domain, and the activity of both domains is required for function of the protein (8Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). MSK1 is constitutively localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with the general transcription activators CBP/p300 (9Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 746-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Although the requirement of p300/CBP for the transcriptional activation of Smad-responsive genes is well established, the precise mechanism of action of these coactivators as well as the implication of other TGF-β-activated pathways in these processes is not well understood. In the present work, we demonstrate that the p38α isoform is activated by TGF-β and that this isoform is required for Smad-driven gene transcription. Our results also indicate that this function of p38 is mediated through the kinase MSK1, which regulates the formation of the Smad3-p300 complexes in response to TGF-β signaling. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for regulating Smad-dependent transcription by the p38 kinase pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Recombinant human TGF-β1 and recombinant IFNα were purchased from Sigma, and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 was purchased from Calbiochem.Vectors—The luciferase reporter plasmids p3TP-Lux and (CAGA)9-Lux were kindly provided by Drs. J. Massague and J. M. Gauthier, respectively. The AP1-Lux plasmid was purchased from Stratagene. The FLAG-tagged versions of wild type (WT) or dominant negative forms (AF) of p38α, p38β2, p38δ, and p38γ were kindly provided by Dr. J. Han. The AFs are p38 mutants that cannot be phosphorylated because TGY dual phosphorylation sites have been changed to AGF. The expression vectors pCMV5-FLAG MSK1 WT and MSK1 dead kinase (MSK1 C-terminal kinase dead (CKD) and MSK1 N-terminal kinase dead (NKD)) were gifts from Dr. D. Alessi. Vector coding for the FLAG-p300 fragment (1734–2464) was a generous gift from Dr. R. Janknecht. Expression vectors coding for Myc-Smad3 and hemagglutinin-TβRI wild type and constitutively activated have been described previously (10Prunier C. Ferrand N. Frottier B. Pessah M. Atfi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3302-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The expression vectors encoding the constitutively activated forms of the MKK3 and MKK6 kinases (MKK3.E and MKK6.E) have been described previously (11Schrantz N. Bourgeade M.F. Mouhamad S. Leca G. Sharma S. Vazquez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3139-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The expression vector pEGFP-Smad3 was constructed using the pEGFP vector and Smad3 cDNA from pGEX-Smad3 (a gift from R. Derynck).Cell Culture and Transfections—The Burkitt lymphoma cells BL41 were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with the different vectors by electroporation at 0.24 kV, 960 microfarads using a Bio-Rad apparatus. MDCK and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with the different vectors by the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen) as described previously. Transfection efficiencies were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase expression from pCMV5.LacZ-control vector. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using a luminescent Galacto-Star™ assay system (Applied Biosystems).Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Quiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first strand of cDNA was made by reverse transcription of 2 μg of total RNA using (dT)-oligomer nucleotides. PCR was performed with upstream primer 5′-CCTTCTACCACGACGACTCA-3′ and downstream primer 5′-GGTGTCACGTGGTTCATCTT-3′ from the JunB sequence. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.8% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide staining.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 0.5% SDS in the presence of 10 units of Benzon nuclease for 5 min at room temperature and boiled for 3 min. Total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred into nitrocellulose filters. Western blotting was performed with antiphospho-Smad3 (a generous gift from P. ten Dijke), antihemagglutinin, anti-FLAG and anti-Myc (Sigma), anti-JunB, anti-PAI-1 (anti-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), anti-MSK1 and anti-p38α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), antiphospho-MSK1 (Thr-581), antiphospho-MSK1 (Ser-376), antiphospho-MSK1 (Ser-360) (Cell Signaling Technology), and p38β (Upstate Biotechnologies) antibodies. Blots were revealed with sheep anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies and chemiluminescence (West Pico or West Femto, Pierce) using a DDC camera (LAS-1000, Fuji).Gene Reporter Assays—Cells were transfected with the different reporter genes by the electroporation method before being incubated in the absence or presence of TGF-β (0.2–1 ng/ml) for 18 h. Extracts were then prepared for luciferase assay following the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega).Protein Kinase Assay—MSK1 kinase activity was determined as described by Atfi et al. (19Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells transfected with FLAG-tagged MSK1 were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10% glycerol. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Transfected MSK1 was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody bound to agarose, washed three times in lysis buffer, and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing 12.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 2 μg of histone H3 (Roche Applied Science), and 20 μm ATP. After incubation at 20 °C for 30 min, kinase reaction products were analyzed by Western blotting using an antiphospho-H3-specific antibody (Cell Signaling Technology).Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation assays, cells were lysed at 4 °C in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by absorption to Sepharose-coupled protein G for 1 h at the same temperature. Immunoprecipitates and aliquots of cell lysates before immunoprecipitation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted.Confocal Microscopy—BL41 cells were transfected with GFP-Smad3 and treated 18 h later with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and/or TGF-β as indicated. Cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 4 °C, stained with Hoechst, and examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Leica Microsystems).RESULTSp38 Pathway Is Involved in Smad-dependent Transcription—To investigate the role of p38 kinase in TGF-β-mediated transcription of target genes, we first determined, in BL41 cells, the effect of a p38 inhibitor SB203580 on different TGF-β-responsive reporters, including AP1-Lux, (CAGA)9-Lux, and p3TP-Lux. The AP1-Lux reporter contains only AP1 sites, whereas the (CAGA)9-Lux contains only concatamerized CAGA elements. The p3TP-Lux contains three AP1 sites from the collagenase-1 promoter and a CAGA box from the PAI-1 promoter. As shown in Fig. 1A, TGF-β induced a strong increase in luciferase activity from the three promoters. These effects were significantly decreased by the addition of the p38 inhibitor SB203580, which is consistent with the general notion that p38 kinase plays an important role in TGF-β-mediated transcription.Because the reporter construct contains only CAGA elements previously shown to bind complexes of Smad3 and Smad4 and to be transactivated by both TGF-β and Smad3-Smad4 (12Dennler S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar), these data suggest that inhibition of p38 kinase might interfere with the ability of Smads to mediate TGF-β transcriptional responses. To further dissect out the events of these signaling pathways, we also tested the effect of MKK3 and MKK6, the upstream kinases that phosphorylate and activate p38 (13Wang L. Ma R. Flavell R.A. Choi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47257-47262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), on the TGF-β-dependent activation of the (CAGA)9-Lux reporter. For this purpose, we transfected BL41 cells with constitutively activated mutants of MKK3 (MKK3.E) or MKK6 (MKK6.E) together with the (CAGA)9-Lux reporter construct. Consistent with the data obtained with the p38 inhibitor, we found that overexpression of MKK3.E and MKK6.E increased the TGF-β-induced CAGA-Lux expression (Fig. 1B). This effect was even more pronounced when both kinases were coexpressed. A similar increase in the sensitivity to TGF-β-induced expression of luciferase was observed when the epithelial MDCK cells were used instead of BL41 cells (Fig. 1B). This effect was specific for MKK3 and MKK6 because as described previously (14Dennler S. Prunier C. Ferrand N. Gauthier J.M. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28858-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), expression of the activated form of MKK4, by activating JNK, inhibited TGF-β-mediated transcription (not shown). To provide further evidence that p38 plays a critical role in TGF-β-mediated gene expression through Smad proteins, we tested the effect of the p38 inhibitor on the TGF-β-dependent expression of endogenous PAI-1 in MDCK cells. We chose to focus our analysis on the PAI-1 promoter as a target of Smad signaling because activation of the PAI-1 promoter by TGF-β requires the formation of a Smad3-Smad4 complex that binds the CAGA sequence (12Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis with anti-PAI-1 antibody demonstrated that treatment of MDCK cells with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 blocked TGF-β-mediated expression of endogenous PAI-1 (Fig. 1C). A similar analysis of PAI-1 in BL41 cells was hampered by our inability to detect PAI-1 in these cells. Therefore we analyzed in both MDCK and BL41 cells the TGF-β-dependent expression of JunB, the expression of which is upregulated by TGF-β through a similar mechanism to that of PAI-1 (15Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, treatment of MDCK and BL41 cells with SB203580 prior to TGF-β addition strongly inhibited the accumulation of JunB in response to TGF-β signaling, suggesting that inhibition of p38 might block the ability of Smads to mediate transcriptional activation. This function of p38 likely takes place at the transcriptional level because treatment of cells with SB203580 yielded a similar decrease in the TGF-β-dependent accumulation of JunB mRNA as evidenced by reverse transcription-PCR analysis (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results strongly support the existence of a functional relationship between Smad and p38 pathways.TGF-β-mediated Phosphorylation and Nuclear Translocation of Smad3 Are Not Modified by Inactivation of p38—The phosphorylation of Smad3 by the activated type I TGF-β receptor and its subsequent heterodimerization with Smad4 and translocation to the nucleus form the basis for a model explaining how Smad proteins work to transmit TGF-β signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus (3Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism by which p38 controls the activation of the Smad pathway, we first investigated whether the p38 inhibitor SB203580 interfered with the ability of the activated type I receptor to phosphorylate Smad3. As shown in Fig. 2A, Smad3 phosphorylation occurred rapidly after exposure of cells to TGF-β, and these phosphorylation events were not affected by treatment of cells with SB203580. To investigate whether the inhibition of p38 could disrupt the nuclear translocation of Smad3 in response to TGF-β signaling, BL41 cells were transfected with GFP-Smad3 and treated with SB203580 prior to activation of TGF-β signaling. As shown in Fig. 2B, Smad3 was localized throughout the cytosol in unstimulated cells, whereas the addition of TGF-β induced an extensive nuclear staining. Treatment of cells with SB203580 had no effect on TGF-β-mediated nuclear translocation of Smad3 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that, in BL41 cells, inhibition of p38 does not interfere with early steps of Smad activation and translocation.Fig. 2SB203580 does not impair Smad phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. A, BL41 cells were transfected with the Myc-Smad3 expression vector and treated 18 h later with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (SB) (20 μg/ml) 30 min before the addition of TGF-β (1 ng/ml). Protein cell extracts were obtained after treatment with TGF-β for different times, and Smad3 phosphorylation was estimated by immunoblotting using a specific antiphospho-Smad3 antibody. The same blot was rehybridized with an anti-Myc antibody. B, BL41 cells were transfected with the GFP-Smad3 vector, were treated 18 h later with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (10 μg/ml) for 30 min, and then were exposed to TGF-β for another 30 min. After fixation, the cells were examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy.

In the case of the p38 family, p38α, p38β, p38δ, and p38γ isoforms have been described as well as splicing variants of p38α and p38β (6Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Depending on the context, the p38 family members have different roles within the cells (16Pramanik R. Qi X. Borowicz S. Choubey D. Schultz R.M. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4831-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We thus sought to identify the p38 isoforms that were involved in Smad-dependent transcription. Toward this aim, BL41 cells were transfected with different vectors encoding wild type or dominant negative p38 isoforms together with the (CAGA)9-Lux reporter. We observed that only the wild type p38α isoform was able to strongly increase TGF-β-mediated luciferase activity, whereas the dominant negative mutant of this isoform greatly decreased this induction (Fig. 3A). The three other isoforms, p38β2, p38δ, and p38γ, did not have a significant effect on TGF-β-mediated luciferase expression despite efficient expression of these kinases (Fig. 3B). Notably, we were able to detect only the endogenous p38α isoform with a specific antibody in BL41 cells (Fig. 3B), which correlated with our findings that p38α was responsible for TGF-β-mediated Smad-driven transcription.Fig. 3p38 isoform α is responsible for increased Smad3 transcription. A, exponentially growing BL41 cells were transfected by electroporation with 5 μg of (CAGA)9-Lux reporter plasmid and 5 μg of p38α, p38β2, p38δ, and p38γ in their wild type or dominant negative form. After 24 h of incubation, cells from the same transfection were divided into two samples and treated or not with TGF-β (1 ng/ml), and incubation continued for 18 h. Luciferase activity was then determined and expressed as activity relative to the control. The results shown are expressed as mean ± S.D. of triplicates from a representative experiment performed at least three times. B, protein cell lysates from each transfection were separated by SDS-PAGE, and protein levels of the different p38 isoforms were detected by immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. The same membrane was stripped and reblotted with an anti-p38α or -p38β antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TGF-β Induces MSK1 Phosphorylation in a p38-dependent Fashion—Previous studies have shown that p38 can phosphorylate and activate the kinase MSK1 (8Deak M.

J. 2002; 365: 757-763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn phosphorylates CBP/p300 (9Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 746-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) leading to modification of nucleosome conformation that increases the accessibility of the transcription machinery to targeted promoters. To determine the mechanism by which p38 acts to enhance TGF-β/Smad signaling, we first investigated the ability of TGF-β signaling to induce the phosphorylation of MSK1. For this, COS7 cells were transfected with wild type MSK1 in the absence or in the presence of the constitutively activated type I receptor, and the extent of MSK1 phosphorylation was examined with an antiphospho-MSK1 antibody that specifically recognizes p38-phosphorylated MSK1. In cells transfected with MSK1, no phosphorylation of MSK1 could be detected in the absence of TGF-β signaling (Fig. 4A). However, coexpression of MSK1 with the constitutively activated type I receptor resulted in a strong phosphorylation of MSK1. This effect was dependent on the activation of TGF-β signaling because overexpression of the wild type form of the type I receptor failed to increase MSK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4D). To test whether TGF-β induces the phosphorylation of endogenous MSK1, BL41 cells were treated with TGF-β for various time periods, and the extent of phosphorylation of MSK1 was analyzed with antiphospho-MSK1. Fig. 4B shows that the exposure of cells to TGF-β caused a significant and persistent phosphorylation of MSK1. We also investigated the ability of TGF-β to induce the activation of MSK1 by using an immunocomplex kinase assay with histone H3 as substrate. In agreement with our results on the phosphorylation of MSK1, we observed an increase in the activity of MSK1 in response to TGF-β signaling (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Phosphorylation and activation of MSK1 are dependent on p38 activation by TGF-β. A, COS7 cells were transfected with wild type FLAG-MSK1 together with or without constitutively activated TβRI (TβRI.act), and MSK1 phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting using specific phospho-MSK1 (Ser-360) antibodies. The expression of transfected DNA was determined by reprobing the same blot with anti-FLAG or antihemagglutinin (-HA) antibodies. B, BL41 cells were treated with TGF-β for different periods of time, and MSK1 phosphorylation was determined in cell extracts by immunoblotting using a specific antiphospho-MSK1 (Thr-581) antibody. The same blot was reprobed with an anti-MSK1 antibody. C, BL41 cells transfected with FLAG-MSK1 were treated or not with TGF-β or IFNα for 2 h, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. MSK1 activity was determined in immunoprecipitates by a kinase assay using histone H3 as substrate. The phospho-H3 (p-H3) was detected by immunoblot using a specific antiphospho-H3 (Ser-10) antibody. Total histone H3 was detected after reprobing the same blot with anti-H3 antibodies. D, COS7 cells were transfected with wild type FLAG-MSK1 together with either TβRI WT or constitutively activated TβRI (TβRI.act). They were then treated or not with SB203580 (SB), and MSK1 activation was determined 18 h later by Western blotting using a specific phospho-MSK1 (Ser-360) antibody. The expression of transfected DNA was determined by reprobing the same blot with anti-FLAG or antihemagglutinin (-HA) antibodies. E, BL41 cells were treated with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (10 μg/ml) 30 min before the addition of TGF-β (1 ng/ml). Protein cell extracts were obtained after treatment with TGF-β for different times, and MSK1 phosphorylation was estimated by immunoblotting using a specific antiphospho-MSK1 (Thr-581) antibody.

For this, we examined the effect of the p38 inhibitor on the ability of TGF-β to mediate the phosphorylation of MSK1. As shown in Fig. 4D, in COS7 cells transfected with MSK1 along with the constitutively activated form of the TGF-β type I receptor, treatment with SB203580 inhibited the TβRI-induced accumulation of the phosphorylated form of MSK1. A similar inhibition by SB203580 was observed when BL41 cells were treated with TGF-β (Fig. 4E), which is consistent with the hypothesis that p38 might act upstream of MSK1 in the TGF-β signaling pathway.MSK1 Is Involved in the Transcriptional Activation Mediated by TGF-β—To test the hypothesis that MSK1 activation contributes to the induction of gene expression by TGF-β, we examined the ability of the wild type form of MSK1 to modulate activation of the (CAGA)9-Lux reporter after the exposure of cells to TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 5A, expression of wild type MSK1 in BL41 cells increased the sensitivity of BL41 cells to TGF-β, suggesting that MSK1 might function as a component of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that expression of a dominant negative mutant of MSK1 inhibited TGF-β-mediated activation of the (CAGA)9-Lux reporter (Fig. 5A). Therefore, we concluded that MSK1 kinase participates in the TGF-β signaling pathway.Fig. 5MSK1 facilitates the Smad3-p300 interaction and is involved in Smad-dependent transcription. A, BL41 cells were transfected with (CAGA)9-Lux reporter plasmid with either MSK1 WT or the dominant negative form MSK1 NKD. Cells were treated with TGF-β for 18 h, and luciferase activity was determined and expressed as activity relative to the control. Results represent the mean of three independent experiments ± S.D. B, COS7 cells were transfected with Myc-Smad3 and FLAG-p300 (1734–2464) in the presence of wild type, N-terminal kinase dead, or C-terminal kinase dead FLAG-MSK1 and wild type (TβRIWT) or constitutively activated (TβRI.act) TGF-β receptor I. Cell lysates obtained after a 24-h incubation were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Myc antibodies and then immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibodies. The expression of transfected DNA was determined by immunoblotting aliquots of cell lysates before immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2030448994,"We have investigated the role of the mitochondrial pathway during cell death following serum and nerve growth factor (NGF)/dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) withdrawal in undifferentiated or NGF/Bt2cAMP-differentiated PC12 cells, respectively. Holocytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and Omi/HtrA2 are released rapidly following trophic factor deprivation in PC12 cells. Bcl-2 and Akt inhibited this release. The protection, however, persisted longer in differentiated PC12 cells. In differentiated, but not undifferentiated cells, Bcl-2 and Akt also inhibited apoptosis downstream of holocytochrome c release. Thus, undifferentiated PC12 cells showed marked sensitivity to induction of apoptosis by microinjected cytochrome c even in the presence of NGF, Bcl-2, or Akt. In contrast, in differentiated cells these factors suppressed cell death. Consistent with these observations, in vitro processing of procaspase 9 in response to cytochrome c was observed in extracts from undifferentiated but not differentiated cells expressing Akt or Bcl-2. Endogenous caspase 9 was cleaved during cell death, whereas dominant negative caspase 9 inhibited cell death. The results from determining the role of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) suggest that acquisition of inhibition by IAPs is part of the differentiation program. Ubiquitin-ΔN-AVPI Smac/DIABLO induced cell death in differentiated cells only. c-IAP-2 is unregulated in differentiated cells, whereas X-linked IAP levels decreased in these cells coincident with cell death. Moreover, expressing X-linked IAP rendered undifferentiated cells resistant to microinjected cytochrome c. Overall, the inhibitory regulation, of cell death at the level of release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors and at post-mitochondrial activation of caspase 9 observed in differentiated PC12 cells, is reduced or absent in the undifferentiated counterparts.

Cell death is essential for the development of the nervous system, where neurogenic precursor cells are produced in excess and then eliminated at specified times during the migration and differentiation of distinct populations of neurons (1Oppenheim R. Annu. Rev. Neurol. 1991; 14: 453-501Google Scholar, 2Raff M.C. Barres B.A. Burne J.F. Coles H.S. Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Science. 1993; 262: 695-700Google Scholar, 3Pettman B. Henderson C.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 633-647Google Scholar). Conversely, suppression of the cell death is vital for the maintenance of non-dividing neurons after terminal differentiation. Compelling experimental evidence that apoptosis is critical for nervous system development has emerged from in vivo studies in mice carrying null mutations for various components of the apoptotic machinery such as Bcl-xL, caspases 3 and 9, and Apaf-1 genes (4Kuida K. Zheng T. Na S. Kuan C.-Y. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Google Scholar, 5Kuida K. Haydar T.F. Kuan C.-Y. Gu Y. Taya C. Karasuyama H. Su M.S. Rakic P.

In all such cases, gross organizational anomalies in developing CNS contribute to the observed prenatal lethality. Thus, in the absence of Bcl-XL, excessive death of differentiating neuronal cells occurs in brainstem and spinal cord. Embryonic mice with null mutations in Apaf-1, caspase 3, or caspase 9 display morphological CNS abnormalities, as a result of supernumerary cells expanded ventricular zone and forebrain protrusions occur. The general inference from detailed analyses in such mice, as well as in the double knock-out mutant mice such as Bcl-xL–/–/caspase 3–/– and Bcl-xL –/–/caspase 9–/–, is that cell death in CNS development not only serves to match the size of a neuronal population to its target field but is also vital for global morphogenesis of the nervous system. Additionally, such observations suggest that the mechanisms responsible for early cell death in neural progenitor cells may differ from those in post-mitotic neurons. In neural progenitor cells, caspase 3 or 9 function is independent of Bcl-xL regulation, whereas in post-mitotic neurons, Bcl-xL acts upstream of caspases 9 and 3 in an epistatic manner (8De La Rosa E. de Pablo F. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 454-458Google Scholar, 9Roth K.A. Kuan C.-Y. Hayder T.F. D'Sa-Eipper C. Shindler K.S. Zheng T.S. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Apoptotic pathways are also activated during inappropriate neuronal death that occurs in acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. For example, activated forms of caspases are observed in degenerating neurons following stroke and in Parkinson or Alzheimer diseases (11Su J.H. Anderson A.J. Cummings B.J. Cotman C.W.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2875-2880Google Scholar). Because caspases are the final implementers of apoptosis, tight control of caspase activation is crucial for long term survival of post-mitotic neurons. Caspases are synthesized as inactive zymogens that are catalytically activated by specific proteolytic cleavage, either by the action of upstream caspases or, in the case of the apical caspases, through autoactivation following their assembly into multimeric protein complexes (13Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Google Scholar, 14Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Google Scholar, 15Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Google Scholar). Mitochondria play a key role in orchestrating activation of one key apical caspase, caspase 9. In response to many mechanistically diverse pro-apoptotic triggers, mitochondria release multiple pro-apoptotic effectors from their inter-membrane space. One of these is holocytochrome c (hcC), 1The abbreviations used are: hcC, holocytochrome c; NGF, nerve growth factor; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ub, ubiquitin; IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis; XIAP, X-linked IAP; Smac, second mitochondrial derived activator of caspases. 1The abbreviations used are: hcC, holocytochrome c; NGF, nerve growth factor; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ub, ubiquitin; IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis; XIAP, X-linked IAP; Smac, second mitochondrial derived activator of caspases. which, once in the cytosol, forms a complex with and activates the Apaf-1-caspase-9 holoenzyme to generate an active “apoptosome” (16Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3179-3184Google Scholar). Upon receipt of an apoptotic signal, mitochondria synchronously release all of their cytochrome c (17Golstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Google Scholar), although the exact molecular mechanism of its translocation remains unresolved (18Green D.R. Reed J.C.

Several other apoptogenic factors are also released from mitochondria during cell death, among them Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2, which both act by binding to and inhibiting IAP function, releasing the activities of caspases 9, 3, and 7 (21Du C.

Substantial experimental evidence indicates that pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bax, Bak, and Bad promote hcC release and, therefore, trigger cell death, whereas the anti-apoptotic members Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent cell death by inhibiting hcC release. In addition, exogenous survival factors such as NGF and insulin-like growth factor-1 inhibit cytochrome c release, in part through an Akt-dependent phosphorylation and deactivation of Bad (24Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Google Scholar, 25Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Google Scholar). Non-differentiated, proliferating PC12 (pheochromocytoma) cells undergo cell death upon withdrawal of serum. However, they can be rescued by acute treatment with various survival factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 or NGF or by administration of Bt2cAMP (26Michel P.P. Vyas S. Agid Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 577-586Google Scholar, 27Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Google Scholar). In addition to signaling survival, some of these factors also induce differentiation of PC12 cells, although any mechanistic relationship between survival and differentiation is unclear. Although caspase-mediated cell death following withdrawal of serum or NGF in PC12 cells and in primary sympathetic neurons has been well studied (28Troy C.M. Stefanis L. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J.

Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 131-143Google Scholar), whether differentiation has a role in regulation of caspases has not been analyzed. We have previously shown that NGF/Bt2cAMP-induced differentiation leads to these cells becoming terminally and irreversibly differentiated, and, upon withdrawal of NGF and Bt2cAMP, they die asynchronously by apoptosis (26Michel P.P. Vyas S. Agid Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 577-586Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the role of cytochrome c/caspase 9 activation during cell death induced by trophic factor withdrawal in undifferentiated and NGF/Bt2cAMP-differentiated PC12 cells. In addition, the regulation of this cell death pathway by the pro-survival effectors Akt and Bcl-2 was examined. Cell Culture and Preparation of Stably Expressing Cell Lines—Undifferentiated PC12 cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum. They were induced to differentiate in modified L15 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 10% horse serum, and 50 ng/ml NGF (7S form, Roche Applied Science) as previously described (26Michel P.P. Vyas S. Agid Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 577-586Google Scholar). After 3 days, 200 μm Bt2cAMP (Sigma) was added, and the cells were differentiated for a further 4–5 days. Cell death was induced in undifferentiated cells (50–60% confluent) by serum withdrawal for 24–48 h. In differentiated cells, apoptosis was triggered by removal of NGF/Bt2cAMP from the medium. Hbcl-2 (human bcl-2) cDNA inserted in pRc/CMV expression vector was electroporated into PC12 cells, G418-resistant hBcl-2 clones were selected, and expression of hBcl-2 protein was verified by Western blot analysis. DNA comprising v-Akt-gag inserted into the pLXSN vector was transfected into the GP+E packaging cell line, and ecotropic virus-containing supernatant was harvested and filtered. PC12 cells were treated for 5 h with this virus supernatant containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene. The virus supernatant was then replaced with RPMI/serum medium, and 24 h later the cells were selected in G418 (250 μg/ml) for a further 3 weeks, after which individual colonies were used for further analyses. cDNA encoding the dominant negative caspase 9 C287S point mutant fused to the FLAG epitope (C9DN) (31Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Google Scholar) was inserted into pcDNA3.1 vector and transfected into PC12 cells by LipofectAMINE treatment, and the G418-resistant pools of clones were selected. Expression of C9DN was verified by immunoblot analysis. G418-resistant PC12 cells in the presence of doxycycline (Sigma, 0.5 μg/ml) transfected with cDNA encoding for mouse XIAP in pN-21 tetracycline-repressible vector, were selected for XIAP function in undifferentiated cells. Parallel cultures of cells were transfected with empty plasmid vector and used as controls (PC12/C). Microinjection—Undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells were cultivated on glass-bottomed coverslip dishes (MatTek Corp.). Cytochrome c (Sigma) solution was freshly prepared at desired concentrations and then mixed thoroughly with 0.4% (final concentration) rhodamine-dextran (Sigma), a fluorescent marker. In differentiated cells, where appropriate NGF/Bt2cAMP was withdrawn just prior to microinjections. Doxycycline was withdrawn ∼16 h prior to microinjections of XIAP/PC12 cells. After microinjections, the medium was replaced and cell death monitored at timed intervals. Microinjection parameters were kept constant: an automated Eppendorf microinjection system was used in which the pressure was held at 120 heptopascals and time at 0.2 s. Approximately 200–350 cells were microinjected for each study, and culture medium was replaced immediately after microinjections. Viability of microinjected cells was monitored by direct fluorescent microscopy at various time points. At high (×63 or ×100) magnification, rhodamine fluorescence was easily detectable in the cytoplasm and neurites of differentiated cells but excluded from the nuclei. The characteristic morphology of apoptosis, rounding up of cells accompanied by homogenous distribution of the rhodamine marker and fragmentation of nuclei and/or cytoplasm into apoptotic bodies, allowed us to quantify the apoptotic versus viable cells. Transient Transfections—Undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells, cultured in 4-well multidishes, were transfected with 0.2 μg of pEGFP plus 0.8 μg of Ub-ΔN-AVPI-Myc or Ub-ΔN-MVPI Smac/DIABLO-Myc cloned in pcDNA3, using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Medium containing LipofectAMINE 2000 was removed after 6 h and replaced with appropriate normal medium. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were deprived of trophic support for 8 or 24 h and after PBS wash, were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were treated with 1 μg/ml Hoescht, and cell death was quantified by counting apoptotic nuclei of GFP-positive cells. It was verified that GFP-positive cells also express Ub-ΔN-AVPI-Myc or Ub-ΔN-MVPI Smac/DIABLO-myc by immunofluorescence using 9E10 anti-myc antibody. Biochemical Methods—Soluble cytoplasmic and membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (32Juin P. Hueber A.-O. Littlewood T. Evan G.I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Google Scholar). Briefly, both undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells were cultured in 15-cm culture dishes. Cells in culture dishes were rinsed twice using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). They were harvested by adding a small volume (100 μl) of cold sucrose-supplemented cell extract buffer (300 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm cytochalasin B, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to culture dishes, scraped, and pelleted. The pellets were resuspended in the above buffer, incubated on ice for 30 min, homogenized, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants comprising the cytoplasmic/soluble fraction and pellets (heavy membrane fraction) were separated and stored at –80 °C. Total cell lysates were prepared, after PBS wash, by directly adding Laemmli buffer containing protease inhibitors to cells; the samples were boiled and centrifuged. Total protein was quantified by the method of Bradford. The antibodies used were cytochrome c (antibody at 1:1000 dilution; BD Pharmingen, clone 7H8.2C12), cytochrome oxidase IV (antibody at 1:1000 dilution, Molecular Probes), Smac/DIABLO (produced at ICR, antibody at 1:1500 dilution), Omi/HtrA2 (antibody at 1:1000 dilution (22Suzuki Y. Imai Y. Nakayama H. Takahashi K. Takio K. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 613-621Google Scholar)), caspase 9 (antibody at 1:1000 dilution, Stressgen), c-IAP-2 (antibody at 1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and XIAP (antibody at 1:1000 dilution (22Suzuki Y. Imai Y. Nakayama H. Takahashi K. Takio K. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 613-621Google Scholar)). The Smac/DIABLO antibody was made against mature N-terminal region (Cancer Research, UK), and the specificity was verified by peptide block. For immunoblot assays, 14, 12, or 10% SDS-PAGE gels were loaded with lysates containing appropriate concentrations of total protein. After transfer to Immobilon P membrane and incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, the signals were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Procaspase 9 Processing—Procaspase 9 cDNA in pBluescript was in vitro transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase, translated, and radiolabeled with 35S-labeled methionine/cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Processing of in vitro-translated procaspase 9 product by the cytoplasmic extracts prepared from PC12 cells was assayed essentially as described previously (31Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 μl of [35S]procaspase 9 product was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with cytoplasmic extracts containing 20 μg of protein (prepared as described above for hcC analysis) in the presence or absence of cytochrome c (10 mm) and dATP (1 mm): all in 10-ml total volume. Laemmli buffer was added, and the samples were boiled and fractionated by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by autoradiography. Cytochrome c Release in Undifferentiated PC12 Cells following Withdrawal of Serum—The kinetics of subcellular redistribution of hcC from mitochondria to cytosol in PC12 cells following withdrawal of trophic support was first analyzed. The amount of hcC in the membrane fraction containing intact mitochondria (verified by electron microscopy) versus the soluble cytoplasmic fraction was determined by immunoblotting. Proliferating undifferentiated PC12 cells maintained in high serum exhibited negligible cytoplasmic hcC. However, withdrawal of serum resulted in a rapid increase in cytosolic hcC, evident by 4 h and persisting at all the time points tested (Fig. 1A, panel i). In contrast to hcC, the integral mitochondrial protein, cytochrome oxidase IV was retained within the membrane fraction (Fig. 1A, panel ii). The cytosolic accumulation of hcC precedes cell death that begins around 18 h after serum deprivation (Fig. 1B). Because Akt and Bcl-2 can suppress the release of hcC from mitochondria and inhibit apoptosis in several cell types (25Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Google Scholar, 33Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Google Scholar), we next assayed cytochrome c translocation following serum deprivation in PC12 cells constitutively expressing either active v-Akt-gag (PC12/Akt) or hBcl-2 (PC12/Bcl-2). Each study was conducted in two independent clones in which expression of either v-Akt-gag or hBcl-2 had been previously verified by immunoblotting (data not shown). In addition, the activated status of v-Akt-gag was confirmed with an antibody specific for phosphorylated Akt at Ser-473 (data not shown). The PC12/Akt and PC12/Bcl-2 clones used each expressed comparable levels of v-Akt-gag or hBcl-2, respectively. During the 24- to 48-h time period of serum deprivation, expression of either v-Akt-gag or hBcl-2 significantly inhibited cell death in undifferentiated PC12 cells (Fig. 1B). For example, upon withdrawal of serum for 24 h, we observed 40 ± 5.5% cell death in control cells compared with <5% in either Akt- or Bcl-2-expressing clones. However, such protection was not absolute, because more extended 72-h serum deprivation elicited some 30% death in both PC12/Bcl-2 and PC12/Akt cells (compared with 80% in PC12 control cells) (Fig. 1B). Immunoblot analysis of hcC levels in serum-deprived PC12/Akt and PC12/Bcl-2 cells showed that cytoplasmic hcC levels only rise ∼18 h after withdrawal of serum (Fig. 1A, panel iii). The quantification of signals revealed that the accumulation of hcC in cytoplasm of these cells was less than in control PC12 cells. Analysis of hcC in whole cell lysates showed comparable levels of hcC in PC12/control, PC12/Bcl-2, and PC12/Akt cells. Thus both Bcl-2 and Akt act to inhibit and delay the otherwise rapid translocation of hcC observed in control PC12 cells. Immunocytochemical staining for hcC corroborated the above immunoblot analysis. PC12 control (PC12/C), PC12/Bcl-2, and PC12/Akt cells in the presence of serum showed punctate mitochondrial hcC staining evident as a rim around the nucleus. In contrast, serum deprivation of PC12/C for as little as 8 h resulted in many cells showing diffuse cytosolic hcC labeling that persisted throughout the period of serum deprivation. PC12/Bcl-2 and PC12/Akt cells deprived of serum for 8 h retained a punctate mitochondrial hcC distribution, which nonetheless became diffuse and cytosolic after 24-h deprivation (data not shown). Cytochrome c Release in Differentiated PC12 Cells following Withdrawal of NGF/Bt2cAMP—Like their undifferentiated counterparts, differentiated PC12 cells deprived of NGF and Bt2cAMP also showed cytosolic hcC, which was evident by 4 h of deprivation, and persisted to 48 h (Fig. 2A, panel i), in contrast cytochrome oxidase IV was observed only within the membrane fraction (Fig. 2A, panel ii). Again, the release of hcC precedes cell death (Fig. 2B). Release of hcC from mitochondria was confirmed by immunocytochemical staining of equivalent cells, which showed that control differentiated PC12 cells retained punctate somatic and neuritic staining, whereas diffuse hcC staining was already evident in some cells by 4–6 h following deprivation of NGF/Bt2cAMP. By 24 h of factor deprivation, many cells displayed both diffuse hcC cytoplasmic pattern and nuclear morphology characteristic of apoptosis (data not shown). In undifferentiated PC12 cells, as described above, both Bcl-2 and Akt delayed hcC translocation to cytoplasm for ∼18 h. No significant increase in cytosolic hcC was observed until 48 h in either differentiated PC12/Bcl-2 or PC12/Akt cells deprived of NGF/Bt2cAMP (Fig. 2A, panel iii). 48 h after withdrawal of NGF/Bt2cAMP, about 20% of cell death was observed in these cells (Fig. 2B). Immunocytochemical analysis revealed a punctate mitochondrial distribution of hcC in cell soma and neurites in 24 h factor-deprived cells that was similar to that in undeprived control cells (data not shown). Overall these results indicate that expression of either Bcl-2 or Akt in factor-deprived differentiated PC12 cells suppresses hcC release and this for a longer period than in factor-deprived undifferentiated cells. Undifferentiated and Differentiated PC12 Cells Display Different Sensitivities to Microinjected Cytochrome c—Release of hcC implies a role of caspase 9 (and caspase 3) pathway during trophic factor deprivation. To clarify any role increased cytosolic hcC might have in PC12 cell death, undifferentiated (proliferating) and differentiated PC12 cells were each microinjected with holocytochrome c together with dextran-conjugated rhodamine as a fluorescent marker. In parallel experiments, the same number of cells was microinjected with dextran-rhodamine marker alone as a control for trauma from microinjections. Subsequent cell fate was then followed after various times by fluorescence microscopy. In both undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells, apoptosis was induced, and its extent, dependent on the dose of cytochrome c. However, undifferentiated cells were far more sensitive to induction of apoptosis by a given dose of microinjected cytochrome c. Thus, at 2 h, 40% of the injected undifferentiated cells (10 μm cytochrome c) had died, whereas there was no significant increase in the percentage of cell death in the differentiated population. However, by 21 h, some 42% of microinjected differentiated PC12 cells had died, indicating that cytochrome c was eventually pro-apoptotic, albeit with greatly delayed kinetics (Fig. 3A). This differential sensitivity to microinjected hcC was also observed in cells microinjected with the higher concentration (25 μm) of cytochrome c, although with more rapid cell death kinetics in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells (data not shown), confirming that cytochrome c-induced cell death is dose-dependent. These data are consistent with the notion that differentiated PC12 cells, unlike their undifferentiated counterparts, can to some extent be protected by intracellular signals capable of ameliorating cell survival even in the presence of exogenous cytochrome c. We next analyzed whether NGF, Bcl-2, or Akt inhibit cell death induced by microinjected holocytochrome c in either undifferentiated or differentiated PC12 cells. Interestingly, in undifferentiated PC12 cells, none of these factors exerted any measurable inhibitory effect on cell death kinetics analyzed 2 and 6 h following microinjections of 2, 10, and 25 μm concentrations of cytochrome c (Fig. 3B). In contrast, in differentiated PC12 cells, cell death induced by microinjection of 10 μm cytochrome c was significantly ameliorated by NGF/Bt2cAMP: for example, 42 ± 10% NGF/Bt2cAMP-treated cells died compared with 91 ± 4% dead cells in similarly microinjected cells deprived of NGF/Bt2cAMP (Fig. 3C). Although withdrawal of NGF/Bt2cAMP from differentiated PC12 cells alone leads to some cell death, this is significantly less than that observed following microinjection of cytochrome c (23 ± 2% control cells dead at 4 h versus 54 ± 8% cells microinjected with cytochrome c). These data indicate that increasing cytosolic cytochrome c in the absence of survival factors accelerates cell death in differentiated cells (Fig. 3C). Pre-treatment of trophic-deprived cells with the broad-specificity caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (10 μm) inhibited, although not completely, apoptosis induced by cytochrome c microinjections (Fig. 3C), in accordance with previous reports that caspases act downstream in cytochrome c-mediated cell death. In sharp contrast to undifferentiated cells, we observed that Bcl-2 and Akt suppressed cell death in differentiated PC12 cells that were deprived of NGF/Bt2cAMP and immediately microinjected with 10 μm cytochrome c (Fig. 3D). Taken together, our results show first that sensitivity to cytosolic cytochrome c decreases during PC12 cell differentiation and second that in differentiated but not undifferentiated PC12 cells, Akt and Bcl-2 can suppress apoptosis downstream of cytosolic hcC. Caspase 9 Activation Is Also Differentially Regulated between Undifferentiated and Differentiated PC12 Cells—One potential implication of our findings is that NGF/Bt2cAMP signaling regulates cell death downstream of cytochrome c release, possibly at the level of activation of caspase 9. To investigate this, we next examined the abilities of extracts derived from factor-deprived PC12 cells to induce cleavage and activation of in vitro translated procaspase 9. Procaspase 9 is cleaved into a detectable large subunit of either 35 or 37 kDa depending on the cleavage site Asp-315 or Asp-330. Processing at Asp-330 resulting in the p37 fragment is"

By using the Xenopus oocyte as an expression system, we have investigated the role of conserved and FXYD7-specific amino acids in the cellular routing of FXYD7 and in its association with and regulation of Na,K-ATPase. In contrast to FXYD2 and FXYD4, the studies on FXYD7 show that the conserved FXYD motif in the extracytoplasmic domain is not involved in the efficient association of FXYD7 with Na,K-ATPase. On the other hand, the conserved Gly40 and Gly29, located on the same face of the transmembrane helix, were found to be implicated both in the association with and the regulation of Na,K-ATPase. Mutational analysis of FXYD7-specific regions revealed the presence of an ER export signal at the end of the cytoplasmic tail. Deletion of a C-terminal valine residue in FXYD7 significantly delayed and decreased its O-glycosylation processing and retarded the rate of its cell surface expression. This result indicates that the C-terminal valine residue is involved in the rapid and selective ER export of FXYD7, which could explain the observed post-translational association of FXYD7 with Na,K-ATPase. In conclusion, our study on FXYD7 provides new information on structural determinants of general importance for FXYD protein action.

Moreover, FXYD7 is identified as a new member of proteins with a regulated ER export, which suggests that, among FXYD proteins, FXYD7 has a particular regulatory function in brain. The Na,K-ATPase uses the hydrolysis of ATP to exchange Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane and to create and maintain the transmembrane Na+ and K+ gradients. The role of the Na,K-ATPase is essential for basic cellular homeostasis as well as for specialized tissue functions. In the kidney, for instance, the Na,K-ATPase is exclusively expressed in the basolateral membrane and thus becomes the driving force for net transepithelial Na+ reabsorption, which is necessary for the maintenance of the extracellular volume and blood pressure. In the nervous system, the presence of Na,K-ATPase permits a rapid restoration of the resting ionic conditions after action potentials and is thus of primary importance for a correct neuronal excitability. At the molecular level, the Na,K-ATPase consists of an α- and a β-subunit. The catalytic α-subunit hydrolyzes ATP and transports the cations, and it also binds cardiac glycosides with high specificity. The β-subunit acts as a molecular chaperone, which plays a crucial role in the structural and functional maturation of the α-subunit (1Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Several α and β isoforms (4α and 3β) exist that may combine to form 12 possible α-β complexes with different transport and pharmacological properties (2Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar, 3Crambert G. Hasler U. Beggah A.T. Yu C. Modyanov N.N. Horisberger J.D. Lelievre L. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1976-1986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase isozymes show a tissue-specific expression and, thus, may cope with different physiological demands. The regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity is tight and complex and involves short and long term mechanisms mediated by hormones and neurotransmitters (for review see Ref. 4Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a new regulatory mechanism has emerged, which involves association of the Na,K-ATPase with small type I membrane proteins of the newly defined FXYD protein family (5Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). This family contains 7 members that share a signature sequence consisting of the FXYD motif and 3 other conserved amino acid residues (for review see Ref. 6Crambert G. Geering K. Sci. STKE. 2003; 166: RE1Google Scholar). We recently characterized FXYD7 (7Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which is exclusively expressed in brain, both in neurons and glial cells. FXYD7 is subjected to O-glycosylation, which appears to be important for protein stability. Expressed in Xenopus oocytes, FXYD7 interacts with α1-β1, α2-β1, and α3-β1 isozymes, but not with α-β2 Na,K-ATPase isozymes, whereas in the brain, FXYD7 can only be co-immunoprecipitated with an antibody against the α1-subunit and not with antibodies against the other α isoforms. FXYD7 modulates Na,K-ATPase transport properties in a different way than FXYD2 (the γ-subunit) (8Béguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K.

After co-expression in Xenopus oocytes, FXYD7 has no effect on the apparent Na+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase but decreases the apparent K+ affinity over a wide range of membrane potentials, though it only affects α1-β1 and α2-β1 isozymes and not α3-β1 isozymes (7Béguin P.

To better understand the regulatory effect on the Na,K-ATPase of FXYD proteins in general, and of FXYD7 in particular, we investigated, in the present study, the role of conserved and FXYD7-specific amino acids in FXYD7 properties, namely in its stability, its intracellular routing, its association with the Na,K-ATPase and in its functional effect on the apparent K+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase. cDNAs—Mouse FXYD7 (7Béguin P.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) served as a template for FXYD7 mutants (see Fig. 1). For truncated mutants (Nt-Δ15, Ct-Δ7, and ΔV80), a series of single PCR reactions was carried out with appropriate primers. PCR products were then digested and subcloned between EcoRI and NotI restriction sites into the pSD5 vector. Point mutations were introduced by using the PCR method described by Nelson and Long (13Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Nt-FLAG FXYD7 and Nt-FLAG ΔV80 were constructed by PCR using a sense primer tailed with the appropriate sequence coding for the FLAG motif (DYKDDDDK) placed upstream of the first ATG and the appropriate antisense primer. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. cDNAs for rat α1- and β1-subunits were kindly provided by J. Lingrel. All cDNAs were introduced into the pSD5 vector. cRNAs were prepared by in vitro translation (14Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). Protein Expression in Xenopus Laevis Oocytes—Stage V-VI oocytes were obtained from Xenopus laevis as previously described (15Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). cRNAs coding for wild-type or mutant FXYD7 (2 ng/oocyte) were injected into oocytes in the presence or absence of cRNAs coding for the rat Na,K-ATPase α1 (10 ng/oocyte) and β1 (1 ng/oocyte) subunits as described in the figure legends. Under these conditions, wild-type, or mutant FXYD7 is expressed in excess of exogenous Na,K-ATPase and is not limiting for the association with Na,K-ATPase. To study protein expression and association, oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's solution (MBS) 1The abbreviations used are: MBS, modified Barth's solution; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGF, transforming growth factor; wt, wild type; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. in the presence of 0.8–1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (Easy Tag Express 35S protein labeling kit, PerkinElmer) at 19 °C. Oocytes were subjected to a 6-h pulse and to 24 h and 48 h chase periods in MBS containing 10 mm cold methionine.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (5–13% gradients) or Tricine-polyacrylamide gels (16.5%) (prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions) and revealed by fluorography. Protein quantification was performed using a laser densitometer (KB Ultrascan 2202). Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological measurements were performed 3 days after oocyte injection with rat α1-β1 cRNAs alone or together with FXYD7 wild-type or mutant cRNAs by using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Measurements of the apparent external K+ affinity at -50 mV were carried out as described (8Béguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K.

The maximal Na,K-ATPase current and the apparent K+ affinity (K½ K+) measured in the presence of 90 mm external Na+ were obtained by fitting the Hill equation to the data using Hill coefficients of 1.6 (17Jaisser F.

The iodinated antibody had an average specific activity of 5–20 × 107 cpm/mol. The assay of binding to oocytes was performed 3, 6, and 48 h after injection. Oocytes were incubated on ice for 1 h in MBS containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum. Binding was initiated by addition of 20 nm of iodinated antibody. After 1 h incubation on ice, the oocytes were washed 8 times with cold MBS containing 5% heat-inactivated calf serum and individually transferred into tubes for γ counting. Nonspecific binding was determined on non-injected oocytes and subtracted from the total binding determined on cRNA-injected oocytes. Effects of Mutations in the N-terminal Extracellular Domain of FXYD7—The N-terminal extracellular domain of FXYD7 shows no homology to that of other FXYD proteins with the exception of the presence of the conserved FXYD motif (FFYD in FXYD7). To determine the role of conserved and FXYD7-specific regions in the N terminus of FXYD7, we produced an AFAA mutant lacking the FXYD motif, a Nt-3T/A mutant lacking the 3 threonines, which are potential sites of O-glycosylation (7Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and an N-terminally-truncated mutant (Nt-Δ15) (see Fig. 1). After expression in Xenopus oocytes, we tested the stability of these mutants, their processing, their association with the α1-β1 Na,K-ATPase isozyme and their functional effect on the apparent K+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase. As shown in Fig. 2, wild-type, metabolically labeled FXYD7 expressed in Xenopus oocytes without Na,K-ATPase was processed from a core protein of about 14 kDa, observed exclusively during a 6-h pulse period, to an O-glycosylated doublet of 18–19 kDa, quite stably expressed during a 24- and 48-h chase period (Fig. 2, A, lanes 1–3, and B). The AFAA mutant was processed similar to the wild-type FXYD7 (Fig. 2A, lanes 10–12). As previously described (7Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the Nt-3T/A mutant lacking the O-glycosylation sites Thr3, Thr6, and Thr9 was degraded during a 48-h chase period (Fig. 2, A, lanes 4–6, and C) indicating a role of O-glycosylation in the stability of FXYD7. Interestingly, truncation of 15 N-terminal amino acids of FXYD7 in a Nt-Δ15 mutant partially restored the stability of the FXYD7 protein during a 24-h chase period (Fig. 2, A, lanes 7–9, and C) suggesting that the 15 N-terminal amino acids may contain a degradation signal. The ability of wild-type and mutant FXYD7 to associate with the α1-β1 Na,K-ATPase isozyme was tested after co-expression in Xenopus oocytes and by immunoprecipitation under nondenaturing conditions with a FXYD7 antibody. Our results indicate that association of wild-type FXYD7 with α1-β1 complexes is time-dependent and occurs post-translationally. Indeed, despite a similar expression level of the α-subunit after the pulse and the chase periods, as revealed by immunoprecipitation with an α antibody (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–3), the amount of α-subunit co-immunoprecipitated with a FXYD7 antibody (Fig. 3, A, lanes 1–3, and C) increased progressively between the 6-h pulse and the 48-h chase. Association of the AFAA mutant with the α-subunit proceeded similar to that of the wild-type FXYD7 (Fig. 3, A, lanes 10–12 and C) indicating that the FXYD motif does not play a role in the efficient interaction of FXYD7 with the Na,K-ATPase. As previously shown (7Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the Nt-3T/A mutant (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–5 and C) associated with Na,K-ATPase at a level similar to wild-type FXYD7 and became stabilized, suggesting that lack of O-glycosylation does not prevent the post-translational association of FXYD7 with the Na,K-ATPase. In contrast, truncation of 15 N-terminal amino acids in the Nt-Δ15 mutant decreased significantly the amount of α-subunit co-immunoprecipitated with FXYD7 antibodies (Fig. 3, A, lanes 7–9 and C) indicating that structural integrity of the N terminus is required for efficient association with Na,K-ATPase. As assessed by electrophysiological means, oocytes expressing Na,K-ATPase alone or together with wild-type FXYD7, with the Nt-3T/A mutant, the Nt-Δ15 mutant, or the AFAA mutant showed similar Na,K-pump currents (Table I) indicating that these N-terminal FXYD mutants do not influence the expression of functional Na,K-ATPase at the cell surface. As previously described (7Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we observed an about 50% decrease in the apparent affinity for K+ of the Na,K-ATPase associated with wild-type FXYD7 (Fig 3D and Table I). A similar effect was produced by the Nt-3T/A and the AFAA mutant as well as by the less efficiently associated Nt-Δ15 mutant. This latter result can be explained by the assumption that the co-immunoprecipitation experiment performed in the presence of digitonin does not reflect the actual proportion of complexes between Na,K-ATPase and the Nt-Δ15 and AFAA mutants in intact cells, but rather the detergent sensitivity for dissociation of these complexes, which is higher than that of complexes including wild-type FXYD7. Altogether, the results suggest that the N-terminal, extracellular domain, including the conserved FXYD motif and the sugar moiety, is not implicated in the functional effect of FXYD7 on the Na,K-ATPase.Table IMaximal current (Imax) and apparent affinity for K+ (K½ K+) at -50 mV for rat Na,K-ATPase (α1β1) associated or not with wild-type or mutant FXYD7a1β1+ImaxK½ K+p valuep valuenAmmvs α1β1vs α1β1+wt FXYD7Control383 ± 330.58 ± 0.03<0.01wt FXYD7285 ± 180.91 ± 0.05<0.01Nt-Δ15351 ± 861.08 ± 0.05<0.01<0.05Nt-3T/A456 ± 861.07 ± 0.02<0.01<0.05AFAA341 ± 301.02 ± 0.05<0.01<0.05G29A295 ± 460.62 ± 0.03>0.05<0.01G40A319 ± 380.76 ± 0.03<0.01<0.01G40W162 ± 120.73 ± 0.04<0.01<0.05S46A342 ± 490.73 ± 0.04<0.01>0.05Ct-3S/A355 ± 310.94 ± 0.03<0.01>0.05Ct-3S/D395 ± 601.06 ± 0.05<0.01>0.05Ct-Δ7313 ± 270.93 ± 0.03<0.01>0.05 Open table in a new tab Effects of Mutations in the Transmembrane Domain of FXYD7—The transmembrane helix is the most conserved domain among FXYD proteins. With the exception of a conserved serine residue (Ser46 in FXYD7), which marks the putative end of the transmembrane domain, invariant residues such as the 2 conserved glycine residues (Gly29 and Gly40 in FXYD7) and nearly invariant amino acids in FXYD proteins are clustered on one side of the transmembrane helix (5Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Alanine replacement of the conserved glycine residue Gly29 or the conserved serine residue Ser46 did not change the stability or the processing of FXYD7 expressed in oocytes (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1–3 to lanes 4–6 and lanes 16–18). Mutation of Gly41 in FXYD2 (Gly40 in FXYD7) into an arginine residue has recently been linked to cases of human autosomal dominant renal hypomagnesaemia (18Meij I.C. Koenderink J.B. van Bokhoven H. Assink K.F. Groenestege W.T. de Pont J.J. Bindels R.J. Monnens L.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Knoers N.V. Nat. Genetics. 2000; 26: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Since this mutation was shown to abolish the interaction of FXYD2 with the Na,K-ATPase (19Pu H.X. Scanzano R. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it has been speculated that magnesium wasting associated with this pathology may be indirectly caused by a loss of Na,K-ATPase regulation by FXYD2. To learn more about the role of this conserved glycine residue, we replaced Gly40 in FXYD7 not only by alanine (G40A) but also by tryptophan, a bulky hydrophobic amino acid (G40W), or by arginine (G40R), a positively charged residue. All of these mutants showed stability and processing similar to wild-type FXYD7 when expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 7–15). Concerning the association with Na,K-ATPase, the S46A mutant associated as efficiently as wild type FXYD7 (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 16–18). On the other hand, alanine replacement of the conserved glycines (G29A or G40A) significantly decreased the association efficiency of FXYD7. Indeed, despite a similar expression level of the α-subunit (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–9), the amount of α-subunit co-immunoprecipitated with a FXYD7 antibody was considerably lower throughout the pulse/chase periods in oocytes expressing the G40A (Fig. 4, B, lanes 7–9 and D) or the G29A mutant (Fig. 4, B, lanes 4–6 and D) than in oocytes expressing wild type FXYD7 (Fig. 4, B, lanes 1–3 and D). Interestingly, replacement of Gly40 by tryptophan instead of alanine further decreased the association efficiency (Fig. 4B, lanes 13–15) and replacement by arginine completely abolished association with Na,K-ATPase (lanes 10–12). Analysis of the functional effect of these mutants on the Na,K-ATPase transport properties showed that the efficiently associated mutant S46A produced an effect on the K+ activation of the Na,K-ATPase similar to wild-type FXYD7 (Fig. 5 and Table I). On the other hand, the glycine mutants that were impeded in their association efficiency produced no (G29A) or a partial effect (G40A and G40W) on the apparent K+ affinity (Fig. 5 and Table I). Interestingly, though the G40R mutant did not associate with the Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 4B, lanes 10–12) and did not impede expression of stable Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 4C, lanes 10–12), its presence led to premature death of some oocytes or to significantly reduced Na,K-pump currents in surviving oocytes. This excluded reliable measurements of the apparent K+ affinity. At present, we do not know the reasons for the deleterious effect on cell viability of the G40R mutant. Altogether, these results point to the importance of the transmembrane domain of FXYD7, and in particular of the conserved glycine residues, both in the association with the Na,K-ATPase and in the modulation of its transport properties. Effects of Mutations in the C-terminal, Cytosolic Domain of FXYD7—Like the extracellular domain, the cytosolic domain of FXYD7 is very distinct from that of other FXYD proteins. For our structure-function analysis, we concentrated on two distinctive sequence motifs namely a 56SRSES60 sequence, which contains 3 putative phosphorylation sites as predicted by the NetPhos 2.0 program (20Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar), and a 75PGGGGV80 sequence at the C-terminal end of the protein (see Fig. 1). FXYD7 in which Ser56, Ser58,and Ser60 were replaced by alanine (Ct-3S/A, abolishment of the phosphorylation sites) or by aspartic acid (Ct-3S/D, mimicry of phosphorylation) showed a stability and processing similar to wild-type FXYD7 (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 1–3 to lanes 7–12). Both mutants associated with Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 6B compare lanes 1–3 and lanes 7–12) and produced a functional effect similar to wild-type FXYD7 (Fig. 6D and Table I). Further experiments are necessary to investigate the possible functional role of phosphorylation in FXYD7. The putative role of the 75PGGGGV80 sequence was assessed in a mutant lacking the seven last C-terminal amino acids (CtΔ7). Truncation of the PGGGGV sequence significantly delayed and decreased the processing of FXYD7 expressed in oocytes. Whereas part of the newly synthesized, wild-type FXYD7 population became O-glycosylated already during the 6-h pulse period (Fig. 6A, lane 1) and the total population after a 24-h chase period (lane 2), the CtΔ7 mutant was not processed during the pulse (lane 4), and only part of the newly synthesized CtΔ7 population was glycosylated after a 24-h chase period (compare lane 4 to lane 5). The remaining nonglycosylated CtΔ7 species were degraded during the chase period (lanes 4–6, 12-kDa band). Since O-glycosylation mainly occurs in an early Golgi compartment (for review see Ref. 21Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), this result indicates that the CtΔ7 mutant exits less rapidly from the ER than wild-type FXYD7. Association of Na,K-ATPase with the CtΔ7 mutant was somewhat less efficient than with wild-type FXYD7 (Fig. 6B, lanes 1–6). Interestingly, in oocytes co-expressing exogenous Na,K-ATPase, the proportion of O-glycosylated CtΔ7 increased after a 24- and a 48-h chase (compare Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 4–6) indicating that association of CtΔ7 with Na,K-ATPase abolishes the retention effect of the mutation. In order to define more precisely the amino acids involved in the delayed processing of CtΔ7, we prepared a mutant in which the PGGGG motif was replaced by alanines but which still contained the terminal valine residue (Ct-P4G/A). As shown in Fig. 7A (lanes 16–18), this mutant, when expressed alone in oocytes, exhibited a time course of processing similar to wild-type FXYD7 (lanes 1–3) indicating that the terminal valine residue and not the PGGGG motif is involved in the normal processing of FXYD7. Indeed, deletion of the terminal valine (ΔVal80) led to a similar delay in FXYD7 processing (Fig. 7A, lanes 7–9) than that observed with the CtΔ7 mutant (Fig. 7A, lanes 4–6). Interestingly, replacement of Val80 by another hydrophobic amino acid (V80A, lanes 10–12) but not by a charged amino acid (V80D, lanes 13–15), restored rapid processing of FXYD7. Finally, to substantiate that Val80 contributes to ER exit of FXYD7, we compared the kinetics of cell surface appearance of epitope-flagged wild-type FXYD7 and of the ΔV80 mutant by radioimmunoassays with anti-FLAG antibodies on intact oocytes. As shown in Fig. 7B, 3 and 6 h after cRNA injection, the cell surface expression of the ΔV80 mutant was significantly lower than that of wild-type FXYD7 though both proteins reached a maximal expression level after 24 h. Altogether these results indicate that the presence of a valine at the end of the intracellular domain is involved in the control of ER exit of FXYD7 and determines the rate of its cell surface expression. The brain-specific FXYD7 belongs to the FXYD protein family and was shown to associate with and regulate Na,K-ATPase transport properties (7Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). FXYD7 is a small type I protein with three distinct parts, a N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal intracellular domain. In this study, we reveal structural determinants in each of these domains that are functionally relevant either for FXYD7 in particular or for FXYD proteins in general. FXYD7-specific parts of the extracellular domain are important for its stability, conserved amino acids in extracellular and the transmembrane domain are involved in the association, probably of all FXYD proteins, with the Na,K-ATPase, and, finally, the intracellular domain contains FXYD7-specific determinants involved in the intracellular routing of FXYD7. Determinants of the Stability and Intracellular Routing of Newly Synthesized FXYD7—Our previous observation that mutations of threonines implicated in O-glycosylation leads to degradation of FXYD7 (7Béguin P. Crambert G. Monnet-Tschudi F. Uldry M. Horisberger J.-D. Garty H. Geering K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) indicates that O-linked sugar chains in the N terminus of FXYD7 contribute to its stabilization. Since O-glycosylation is a post-translational event that mainly occurs in different Golgi compartments (for review see Ref. 21Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), it is difficult to conceive how it can protect FXYD7 from the ER quality control system involved in the recognition and degradation of improperly processed or misfolded proteins (for review see Ref. 22Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, it may be postulated that newly synthesized FXYD7 recycles between the ER and an early Golgi compartment, and only escapes ER degradation if glycosylation occurs during its presence in the Golgi, which impedes retrograde transport to the ER and permits further routing to the plasma membrane. Significantly, association with Na,K-ATPase prevents the"
https://openalex.org/W1993585699,"Mutational studies of T cell receptor (TCR) contact residues on the surface of the human class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule HLA-A2 have identified a spot that comprises Arg(65) and Lys(66) and is involved in by most peptide-specific HLA-A2-restricted TCRs. Although there is a significant amount of functional data on the effects of mutations at these positions, there is comparatively little biochemical information that could illuminate their mode of action. Here, we have used a combination of fluorescence anisotropy, functional assays, and Biacore binding experiments to examine the effects of mutations at these positions on the peptide-MHC interaction and TCR recognition. The results indicate that mutations at both position 65 and position 66 influence peptide binding by HLA-A2 to various extents. In particular, mutations at position 66 result in significantly increased peptide dissociation rates. However, these effects are independent of their effects on TCR recognition, and the Arg(65)-Lys(66) region thus represents a true hot spot for TCR recognition. We also made the observation that in vitro T cell reactivity does not scale with the half-life of the peptide-MHC complex, as is often assumed. Finally, position 66 is implicated in the dual recognition of both peptide and TCR, emphasizing the multiple roles of the class I MHC peptide-binding domain."

In the absence of Mg2+, mutations removing the charges of domain P residues Asp627, Lys684, Asp703, and Asp707 increased the affinity for ATP and 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-8-azidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate.

Under these conditions, ATP binding was almost completely blocked in Gly626 → Ala and occurred with 12- and 7-fold reduced affinities in Asp703 → Ala and Asp707 → Cys, respectively, relative to the situation in the presence of Mg2+ without Ca2+, whereas in Lys684 → Met and Asp707 → Ser/Asn the affinity was enhanced 14- and 3–5-fold, respectively. Hence, Gly626 and Asp703 seem particularly critical for mediating entry into the transition state for phosphoryl transfer upon Ca2+ binding at the transport sites.

This ion pump is a well studied example of P-type ATPases, the catalytic cycle of which includes a phosphorylated aspartyl intermediate and progression through E1 and E2 states. ATP-dependent phosphorylation takes place upon Ca2+ binding in the E1 form, and hydrolysis of the aspartyl phosphoryl bond occurs in the E2P phosphoenzyme conformation following Ca2+ translocation across the membrane. Two atomic structures of the protein have been elucidated by x-ray crystallography, one in the presence of Ca2+ (designated E1(Ca2)) and another in the absence of Ca2+ and presence of the specific inhibitor thapsigargin (E2(TG)) (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar, 2Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Google Scholar). They reveal 10 membrane-spanning helices, connected through a stalk section to the phosphorylation (P) domain in association with nucleotide (N) and actuator (A) domains. The three head domains are loosely attached in E1(Ca2) and closer together, forming a more compact entity, in E2(TG). For ATP-dependent phosphorylation of Asp351 to occur in the Ca2+ bound E1 state, domain N must close over the phosphorylation site, such that the nucleotide site is brought close to Asp351. ATP likely straddles both domains, the nucleoside portion anchored in domain N and the phosphates stretching into domain P (cf.Fig. 1A). Domain P contains the highly conserved segments 625TGD, 676FARXXPXXK, and 701TGDGVND that surround the phosphorylation loop 351DKTGTLT. Many of these residues have been implicated in ATP binding and catalysis on the basis of chemical labeling and cross-linking experiments, and mutagenesis of Ca2+-ATPase and related pumps (for review, see Ref. 3McIntosh D.B.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Google Scholar). Atomic structures of several intermediate or pseudo-intermediate states have provided a detailed view of the reaction pathway in the case of phosphoserine phosphatase, and show small progressive structural adjustment of the active site loops and attendant side chains leading to a tight transition state configuration around the phosphoryl group or analog (cf. Ref. 5Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grigoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Google Scholar and Fig. 1B). The equivalent residues in E1(Ca2) and E2(TG) structures of Ca2+-ATPase are further apart compared with those of phosphoserine phosphatase (Fig. 1, compare A and B), raising the question whether significant gathering or closing around the γ-phosphoryl group or phosphate is required in the ion pump to reach the transition state for phosphoryl transfer. Hence, an important challenge is to reveal such structural changes in the Ca2+-ATPase. Mg2+, which, according to structures of phosphoserine phosphatase and other proteins in this family, is critically situated between the 351DKTGT phosphorylation loop, 701TGDVND loop (with Asp703 being strongly involved in ligation), and the phosphoryl group (cf.Fig. 1B), may be a key component of the tightening. ATP may also be required; the crystals of E1(Ca2) were grown in the presence of high Mg2+ and Ca2+, and yet there was no divalent cation at the putative catalytic Mg2+ site near Asp351, possibly because of the absence of ATP. Ca2+ binding at the membranous transport sites activates phosphoryl transfer to Asp351 and may be another important component required for the tightening to reach the transition state. The present study expands on our previous studies of domain P mutations, which investigated the role of the conserved phosphorylation loop 351DKTGTLT in MgATP binding (6McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25227-25236Google Scholar, 7Clausen J.D. McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35741-35750Google Scholar). We now focus on the other conserved segments of the P domain mentioned above. We have introduced new mutations of some of the conserved residues in these segments, including the putative Mg2+ binding residue, Asp703, as well as Lys684 and Asp707, and we also reexamine previously studied mutants (8Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22223-22227Google Scholar, 9Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Google Scholar, 10Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13038-13042Google Scholar), using our recently developed techniques for measurement of nucleotide binding and kinetics of phosphorylation, to assess the roles of these residues in nucleotide and Mg2+ binding and stabilization of the Ca2+-activated transition state for phosphoryl transfer. Residues in the highly conserved hinge segments, 601DPPR and 359NQ(R/K)MSV, which link the N and P domains, have been studied to probe interdomain movements and the role of the hinge. Because some of the mutants exhibited very slow or negligible phosphorylation, it was possible to measure ATP binding in the presence of both Mg2+ and Ca2+, thereby providing insight in the interaction with ATP in the transition state for phosphoryl transfer. Mutagenesis and Expression—Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of cDNA encoding the rabbit fast twitch muscle Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a isoform) was carried out as described previously (9Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Google Scholar). For expression, the cDNA in pMT2 vector (11Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Google Scholar) was transfected into COS-1 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation (12Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). The microsomal fraction containing expressed wild-type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase was recovered by differential centrifugation (13Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Google Scholar). The concentration of expressed protein was quantified by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (9Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Google Scholar). Phosphorylation—Transient kinetic experiments at 25 °C were performed using a Bio-Logic quenched flow module QFM-5 (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Claix, France) as described (14Sørensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of ATP to the Ca2+-bound Ca2+-ATPase. Other phosphorylation and dephosphorylation experiments were carried out by manual mixing techniques (7Clausen J.D. McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35741-35750Google Scholar). Acid quenching was performed with 0.5–2 volumes of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 100 mm H3PO4. The acid-precipitated protein was washed by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 7% polyacrylamide gel at pH 6.0 (15Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Google Scholar), and the radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase band was quantified by imaging, using a Packard Cyclone™ Storage Phosphor System. The background phosphorylation level was determined in parallel experiments with control microsomes isolated from mock-transfected COS-1 cells. Assays for Nucleotide Binding—The synthesis of [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP, the photolabeling of COS-1 cell microsomes containing wild-type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase (at room temperature), the inhibition by ATP, and the quantification of labeled bands by radio-imaging following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were carried out as described previously (16McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Google Scholar). The concentration of [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP was 3 × K0.5 in the inhibition experiments with ATP. Tight β,γ-Bidentate Cr(III)ATP (CrATP) Binding—The assay consists of preincubating the Ca2+-ATPase with CrATP at 37 °C and then determining the fraction of enzyme not tightly complexed with CrATP by photolabeling with [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP in excess EDTA following a large dilution, as described previously (6McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25227-25236Google Scholar) and also in the legend to the figure. β,γ-Bidentate CrATP was prepared as described by Dunaway-Mariano and Cleland in method B (17Dunaway-Mariano D. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1496-1505Google Scholar). Calculations and Data Analysis—The phosphorylation data and the [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP labeling data were analyzed as detailed previously (14Sørensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Google Scholar, 16McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Google Scholar). The “true” dissociation constant for ATP and MgATP binding was calculated using the validated equation for competitive inhibition of the [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP labeling (16McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Google Scholar). The mutants examined are listed in Table I. To follow the results, it is helpful to know the disposition of these residues in the phosphorylation site and roughly how ATP and Mg2+ may bind. A model based on the crystal structure of Ca2+-ATPase in the E2(TG) conformation (2Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Google Scholar), the atomic structure of the homologous phosphoserine phosphatase with bound phosphoserine (5Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grigoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Google Scholar), and an NMR structure of ATP bound to domain N of Na+,K+-ATPase (18Hilge M. Siegal G. Vuister G.W. Guntert P. Gloor S.M. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 468-474Google Scholar) is presented in Fig. 1A. ATP is shown in yellow. The AMP portion of ATP is lodged in domain N, and the β- and γ-phosphates in domain P in a position close to Asp351, the residue receiving the γ-phosphate from ATP. The ATP molecule is stretched between the α- and β-phosphates (indicated by dashed line) to reach both sites, and it is apparent that further movement of the two domains is needed for the ATP to straddle both binding sites. This problem is even more pronounced in the E1(Ca2) Ca2+-ATPase crystal structure (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar), which led us to prefer the E2(TG) structure rather than E1(Ca2) for modeling the ATP binding site. In a transition state-like structure of phosphoserine phosphatase, where AlF3 is bound as a phosphoryl transition state analog, Mg2+ is coordinated by a fluoride atom, the residues equivalent to Asp351 and Asp703, the main chain carbonyl of the equivalent of Thr353, and two water molecules (Fig. 1B). AlF3 is ligated to main chain amides of residues equivalent to Lys352, Thr353, and Gly626, as well as to side chains of the equivalents of Thr625 and Lys684 (Ref. 5Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Nguyen H.H. Grigoriev I.V. Wemmer D.E. Kim S.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Google Scholar and Fig. 1B). Hence, these residues are candidates as ligands of Mg2+ and γ-phosphate, respectively, in the transition state of the Ca2+-ATPase.Table INucleotide binding and phosphorylation parametersMutationBinding in EDTAaMedium consisted of 25 mm EPPS/TMAH (pH 8.5), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm EDTA.Binding in Mg2+/EGTAbMedium consisted of 25 mm EPPS/TMAH (pH 8.5), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA.Binding in Mg2+/Ca2+cMedium consisted of 25 mm EPPS/TMAH (pH 8.5), 20% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm CaCl2.Phosphorylation ratedData were obtained as described for Fig. 3 (A and B).

Open table in a new tab Nucleotide Binding with and without Mg2+ in the Absence of Ca2+—Direct measurement of ATP binding to mutant Ca2+-ATPase expressed in COS-1 cell microsomes is not possible by conventional methods because of the low amount of expressed protein. However, we have developed a binding assay based on specific [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP photolabeling of Lys492 in domain N and its inhibition by ATP, competing for binding (16McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Google Scholar). Briefly, the concentration dependence of TNP-8N3-ATP photolabeling provides a K0.5 value, which is the concentration at which there is half-maximal photolabeling, and then the ATP concentration dependence of inhibition of photolabeling is studied at a concentration of TNP-8N3-ATP approximately equal to 3 × K0.5. This provides a K0.5 value for ATP binding from which the “true” KD for ATP binding is calculated using the equation for competitive binding. TNP-8N3-ATP is a substrate for the Ca2+-ATPase both when bound noncovalently and when covalently attached to Lys492, although the hydrolysis is slow for this substrate (19McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21587-21595Google Scholar). The binding parameters obtained with wild type and the mutants are presented in Table I, and examples of the underlying experimental data are shown in Fig. 2. In the table, values of K0.5(TNP-8N3-ATP) and KD(ATP) more than 2-fold different from wild type are shown in bold type, and, of these, those showing an increase in affinity are in italics. For side chains contributing to ligation of the nucleotide, a reduced affinity is expected upon mutation. For charged side chains, removal of the charge by mutation may lead to an increase of the affinity for the nucleotide, if there is electrostatic repulsion in the wild type. Examining domain P mutations in the absence of Mg2+ first, it can be seen that most charge-removing mutations increased the affinity for TNP-8N3-ATP and ATP. This was especially pronounced for Asp707→ Asn, where the affinity was increased 33- and 14-fold, respectively. Asp707→ Cys hardly changed the affinity for ATP, which may be taken as an indication that the sulfhydryl group is ionized, thereby maintaining the same electrostatic environment as the aspartate. Rather surprisingly considering their conservation in related enzymes, but in keeping with what has been found for Asp351 (6McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25227-25236Google Scholar), replacement of Asp627 and Asp703 with the longer glutamate side chain had no effect on binding of TNP-8N3-ATP or ATP, suggesting there are no steric clashes. We conclude that in wild type none of the residues appear to be involved in ligation of the phosphates of TNP-8N3-ATP or ATP in the absence of Mg2+, and mostly electrostatic repulsive forces prevail. In the presence of Mg2+, a different picture emerges, showing differential mutational effects on TNP-8N3-MgATP and MgATP binding. Under the conditions applied, ∼95% of ATP should exist in the form of the MgATP complex, with a single negative charge. This complex binds to wild-type enzyme with higher affinity than uncomplexed ATP, whereas the Mg2+ complex of TNP-8N3-ATP binds with lower affinity than the uncomplexed nucleotide to the wild type (Table I). Some mutations increased the affinity for TNP-8N3-MgATP, some had no effect, whereas others mildly decreased the affinity, relative to wild type. The 22-fold increase in TNP-8N3-MgATP affinity seen for Lys684→ Met is particularly prominent. Increases in TNP-8N3-MgATP affinity were found for mutations of neighboring Asp707, as well, resembling to some extent the situation in the absence of Mg2+. Mutations of Asp703 did not affect TNP-8N3-MgATP binding. Mg2+, thus, decreased the affinity for TNP-8N3-ATP even more in the Asp703 mutants than in the wild type. Hence, Lys684, Asp707, and Asp703 do not contribute to coordination of the Mg2+ binding with TNP-8N3-ATP. In contrast, many domain P mutations decreased the affinity for MgATP. The most critical residues seem to be Gly626 and Lys684, for which replacement with alanine and methionine, respectively, led to 28- and 22-fold decrease of MgATP affinity, indicating that the main chain of Gly626 and side chain amino group of Lys684 play important roles in the ligation of MgATP. In the case of the aspartates, 3–8-fold decreases of affinity were observed for mutations removing the negative charge. It is interesting to note that, in these mutants, there is little difference between the affinities for ATP and MgATP, because the affinity for ATP is increased and the affinity for MgATP decreased, compared with wild type. As seen for ATP, mutation of Asp627 or Asp703 to glutamate had no significant effect on the affinity for MgATP, again suggesting no steric clashes with the longer side chain. Mutation Asp707→ Cys was also silent, and again this may be because the cysteine is ionized. Asn359 and Asp601 are located on the flexible hinge segments linking domains N and P (cf.Fig. 1A). Mutation of these two residues had little or no effect on ATP binding in the absence of Mg2+, but in the presence of Mg2+, Asn359→ Ala and Asp601→ Asn caused pronounced increases in affinity for both nucleotides, whereas Asp601→ Glu was detrimental. Phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP and Phosphoenzyme Turnover—In the presence of Ca2+, the interaction with MgATP normally leads to phosphoryl transfer to Asp351 with resulting formation of the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate, E1P. It was previously reported that Asp601→ Glu, Gly626→ Ala, Asp703→ Ala, and Asp707→ Asn are unable to form significant amounts of phosphoenzyme upon incubation with 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP and Ca2+ for 10 s at 0 °C, whereas Asp601→ Asn, Asp627→ Glu, Lys684→ Arg, Asp703→ Glu, and Asp703→ Asn form a phosphoenzyme under these conditions (8Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22223-22227Google Scholar, 9Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Google Scholar, 10Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13038-13042Google Scholar). We were able to confirm these findings, except for Asp601→ Glu, which phosphorylated to a wild type-like level in our hands. With respect to those mutants that have not been previously studied, we observed wild type-like accumulation of phosphoenzyme in the case of Asn359→ Ala and Asp627→ Asn, whereas Lys684→ Met, Asp703→ Cys, Asp703→ Ser, Asp707→ Cys, and Asp707→ Ser were unable to form a significant amount of phosphoenzyme when incubated with 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP and Ca2+ at 0 °C. We then proceeded to study the rate of phosphorylation at 25 °C, using a quenched flow procedure (14Sørensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Google Scholar). At 25 °C, all the mutants, except Lys684→ Met and the three mutants with alteration to Asp707, were capable of undergoing measurable phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+ (E1 → E1P transition). Examples of data obtained under these conditions are shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), and all the observed rate constants are listed in Table I. It should be understood that, because the MgATP concentration applied (5 μm) is close to the Km for phosphorylation of wild type, changes in the affinity for MgATP as well as the Vmax for phosphorylation are being reflected in the phosphorylation rate. In the hinge segments, mutation Asn359→ Ala had no effect on the phosphorylation rate, whereas both mutations of Asp601 slowed phosphorylation. A moderate slowing of the phosphorylation rate at 25 °C was also recorded for mutations of Asp627. Mutation Gly626→ Ala and mutation of Asp703 to alanine, cysteine, or serine reduced the rate of phosphorylation several hundredfold (cf.Table I and Fig. 3B, showing the data for Asp703→ Ala), whereas the more conservative changes of Asp703 to asparagine and glutamate only reduced the phosphorylation rate to 46 and 74%, respectively, compared with wild type (Fig. 3A and Table I). It is remarkable that phosphoenzyme did accumulate in Asp703→ Ala/Cys/Ser, despite the low rate of phosphorylation, suggesting that a step in the reaction sequence leading to dephosphorylation is also blocked. This was further examined for Asp703→ Ala, and, as seen in Fig. 3C, the dephosphorylation observed upon chase of the phosphoenzyme with nonradioactive ATP was unusually slow. A rapid dephosphorylation was, on the other hand, observed upon addition of ADP to reverse the phosphorylation step, indicating that the accumulated phosphoenzyme intermediate was ADP-sensitive E1P and that the slow step in the forward dephosphorylation is the E1P → E2P conformational transition. Among the mutants studied, only Asn359→ Ala and Asp703→ Glu showed Ca2+ transport activity higher than 10% of wild type in the presence of a high MgATP concentration of 5 mm at 37 °C (50 and 30%, respectively; data not shown; assay carried out as described in Ref. 20Clausen J.D. McIntosh D.B. Vilsen B. Woolley D.G. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20245-20258Google Scholar). A block or slowing of the E1P → E2P transition has previously been described for mutants Asp601→ Asn, Lys684→ Arg, Asp703→ Asn, and Asp627→ Glu, on the basis of measurements similar to those shown in Fig. 3C (8Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22223-22227Google Scholar, 9Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Google Scholar). We confirmed these results and, furthermore, observed a marked inhibition of the E1P → E2P transition in Asp601→ Glu and Asp627→ Asn, and a less pronounced slowing in Asn359→ Ala and Asp703→ Glu (Fig. 3C and Table I). Because E1P → E2P normally is the rate-limiting step in the transport cycle at saturating ATP and Ca2+ concentrations, the inhibition of this step must contribute, besides a reduced phosphorylation rate, to reduce the Ca2+ transport activity in the mutants. Nucleotide Affinity in the Presence of Ca2+—In the presence of both Mg2+ and Ca2+, TNP-8N3-ATP is a substrate of the Ca2+-ATPase (19McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21587-21595Google Scholar). Hence, it is normally not possible to measure TNP-8N3-ATP or ATP binding by the photolabeling assay under these conditions, because the γ-phosphoryl group would be cleaved off, both from TNP-8N3-ATP and from the ATP used to competitively inhibit the photolabeling. However, for the mutants exhibiting no or very low phosphorylation activity, the assay could be employed with both Mg2+ and Ca2+ present, i.e. the conditions where the transition state in the phosphoryl transfer reaction normally would be attained. Results are shown in Fig. 2 and Table I. With respect to TNP-8N3-ATP binding, a pronounced Ca2+ effect was noticed only for Lys684→ Met, where the binding affinity was lowered ∼10-fold relative to the sit"

https://openalex.org/W2051650708,"Protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase I) catalyzes the attachment of a geranylgeranyl lipid group near the carboxyl terminus of protein substrates. Unlike protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type II, which require both Zn(II) and Mg(II) for maximal turnover, GGTase I turnover is dependent only on Zn(II). In FTase, the magnesium ion is coordinated by aspartate β352 and the diphosphate of farnesyl diphosphate to stabilize the developing charge in the transition state (Pickett, J. S., Bowers, K. E., and Fierke, C. A. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 51243–51250). In GGTase I, lysine β311 is substituted for this aspartate and is proposed to replace the catalytic function of Mg(II) (Taylor, J. S., Reid, T. S., Terry, K. L., Casey, P. J., and Beese, L. S. (2003) EMBO J. 22, 5963–5974). Here we demonstrate that the prenylation rate constant catalyzed by wild type GGTase I (kchem = 0.18 ± 0.02 s-1) is not dependent on Mg(II), is ∼20-fold slower than the maximal rate constant catalyzed by FTase, and has a single pKa of 6.4 ± 0.1, likely reflecting deprotonation of the peptide thiol. Mutation of lysine β311 in GGTase I to alanine (Kβ311A) or aspartate (Kβ311D) decreases the kchem in the absence of magnesium 9–41-fold without significantly affecting the binding affinity of either substrate. Furthermore, the geranylgeranylation rate constant is enhanced by the addition of Mg(II) for Kβ311A and Kβ311D GGTase I 2–5-fold compared with wild type GGTase I with KMg of 140 ± 10 mm and 6.4 ± 0.8 mm, respectively. These results demonstrate that lysine β311 of GGTase I partially replaces the catalytic function of Mg(II) observed in FTase. Protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase I) catalyzes the attachment of a geranylgeranyl lipid group near the carboxyl terminus of protein substrates. Unlike protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type II, which require both Zn(II) and Mg(II) for maximal turnover, GGTase I turnover is dependent only on Zn(II). In FTase, the magnesium ion is coordinated by aspartate β352 and the diphosphate of farnesyl diphosphate to stabilize the developing charge in the transition state (Pickett, J. S., Bowers, K. E., and Fierke, C. A. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 51243–51250). In GGTase I, lysine β311 is substituted for this aspartate and is proposed to replace the catalytic function of Mg(II) (Taylor, J. S., Reid, T. S., Terry, K. L., Casey, P. J., and Beese, L. S. (2003) EMBO J. 22, 5963–5974). Here we demonstrate that the prenylation rate constant catalyzed by wild type GGTase I (kchem = 0.18 ± 0.02 s-1) is not dependent on Mg(II), is ∼20-fold slower than the maximal rate constant catalyzed by FTase, and has a single pKa of 6.4 ± 0.1, likely reflecting deprotonation of the peptide thiol. Mutation of lysine β311 in GGTase I to alanine (Kβ311A) or aspartate (Kβ311D) decreases the kchem in the absence of magnesium 9–41-fold without significantly affecting the binding affinity of either substrate. Furthermore, the geranylgeranylation rate constant is enhanced by the addition of Mg(II) for Kβ311A and Kβ311D GGTase I 2–5-fold compared with wild type GGTase I with KMg of 140 ± 10 mm and 6.4 ± 0.8 mm, respectively. These results demonstrate that lysine β311 of GGTase I partially replaces the catalytic function of Mg(II) observed in FTase.

Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase), protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase I), and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type II (GGTase II) comprise the class of zinc-catalyzed sulfur alkylation enzymes known as the protein prenyltransferases. All three protein prenyltransferases are α/β heterodimers; FTase and GGTase I share common α-subunits and possess β-subunits with 25% sequence identity (8Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev.

In a fashion distinct from FTase and GGTase I, GGTase II catalyzes the attachment of two geranylgeranyl groups to members of the Rab family of GTPases that contain carboxyl-terminal sequences of XXCC, XCXC, XCCX, and CCXX (C refers to a conserved cysteine residue, and X refers to any amino acid) (24Liang P.H. Ko T.P. Wang A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3339-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Recently, much of the work on prenyltransferases has focused on FTase and the protein substrate, Ras, a small GTPase in the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway that is a key regulator of cell division (25Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 21-36Google Scholar). 30% of all human cancers can be linked to mutations in the ras gene, which lead to constitutively activated Ras signaling (25Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 21-36Google Scholar). The post-translational attachment of a farnesyl group by FTase is required for the transforming activity of Ras oncoproteins (25Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 21-36Google Scholar). These observations prompted a search for FTase inhibitors as novel anticancer agents (25Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 21-36Google Scholar). Subsequent research demonstrated that the form of Ras most often mutated in human cancers is K-Ras4B, a protein substrate that can be farnesylated by FTase as well as geranylgeranylated by GGTase I (25Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 21-36Google Scholar). Moreover, geranylgeranylated G proteins in addition to Ras have been shown to play important roles in smooth muscle proliferation and apoptosis (25Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 21-36Google Scholar). The latter observations have initiated a search for GGTase I inhibitors for use in cancer therapy as well as for the treatment of cardiovascular disease (25Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 21-36Google Scholar). The protein prenyltransferases catalyze thioether bond formation between the cysteine sulfur of the protein substrate and the carbon-1 of the isoprenoid substrate, a reaction requiring a catalytically essential zinc ion (13Casey P.J.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Zn(II) in GGTase I is required for peptide but not isoprenoid binding, suggesting that Zn(II) plays a similar role in both FTase and GGTase I. The zinc ion in FTase coordinates the sulfur of the cysteine within the CaaX sequence of the protein substrate, stabilizing the nucleophilic thiolate (26Hightower K.E. Huang C.C. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15555-15562Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). FTase and GGTase II also require Mg(II) for maximal activity (27Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17438-17443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Reiss Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6403-6408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In FTase, Mg(II) accelerates the chemical step 700-fold by coordinating the diphosphate group of the isoprenoid substrate, thereby stabilizing the negative charge buildup on the diphosphate leaving group (29Bowers K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5256-5265Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Huang C.C. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12398-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies provide evidence that Mg(II) is also coordinated by an aspartate residue in FTase (32Pickett J.S. Bowers K.E. Fierke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51243-51250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Mg(II) dependence of GGTase I is not well understood. Initial studies indicated that, similar to FTase, GGTase I required Mg(II) for maximal activity (33Zhang F.L. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23465-23470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Yokoyama K. McGeady P. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, later studies demonstrated that metal-chelating reagents have little effect on the steadystate turnover rate of GGTase I, suggesting that Mg(II) is not required for maximal activity (35Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments and the crystal structures of FTase and GGTase I indicate that the aspartate in FTase that coordinates Mg(II) is replaced by lysine 311 in the β-subunit of GGTase I, leading to the suggestion by Beese and colleagues (12Taylor J.S. Reid T.S. Terry K.L. Beese L.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5963-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 36Long S.B. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Nature. 2002; 419: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) that Lys-β311 in GGTase I replaces the catalytic function of Mg(II) in FTase. Here we characterize the kinetics of wild type GGTase I and examine the role of residue Lys-β311 in catalysis using mutagenesis and biochemical experiments. These data demonstrate that the rate constant for geranylgeranylation catalyzed by GGTase I is slower than the farnesylation rate constant catalyzed by FTase and not enhanced by Mg(II), suggesting differences in the catalytic mechanisms between FTase and GGTase I. When Lys-β311 in GGTase I is replaced by alanine or aspartate, geranylgeranylation is now enhanced by Mg(II), indicating that Lys-β311 is important for blocking activation by Mg(II) in wild type GGTase I. However, when the lysine side chain is removed in Kβ311A GGTase I, the rate constant for geranylgeranylation in the absence of Mg(II) decreases 40-fold, indicating that Lys-β311 modestly enhances catalysis. Furthermore, the lysine side chain is not as effective at stabilizing the diphosphate leaving group as Mg(II) in FTase, which enhances catalysis 700-fold; therefore, GGTase I is not as efficient as FTase in catalyzing prenylation (30Huang C.C. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2593-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Miscellaneous Methods—All assays were performed at 25 °C. All curve fitting was performed with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Tritium-labeled farnesyl diphosphate ([1-3H]FPP) and tritium-labeled geranylgeranyl diphosphate ([1-3H]GGPP) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The peptides GCVLL and dansylated GCVLL were synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography by Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). The concentration of peptide was determined spectroscopically at 412 nm by reaction of the cysteine thiol with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), using an extinction coefficient of 14,150 m-1 cm-1 (37Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). GGTase I concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 134,000 m-1 cm-1, which was calculated using the method of Edelhoch (38Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar; data not shown). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were pre-run in 100% acetone before use. Subcloning of GGTase I—A bacterial expression vector for rat GGTase I was prepared in the following way. Mutagenesis of the high expression rat FTase pET23a-FPT plasmid (39Zimmerman K.K. Scholten J.D. Huang C.C. Hupe D.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 14: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to introduce an EcoRI restriction site into the stop/start region between the genes encoding the two subunits of FTase with the following codon changes: GAGGAGTTT to GAGGAATTC. The modified pET23a-FPT plasmid was cut using the restriction enzymes EcoRI and NdeI to remove a DNA fragment containing the β-subunit of FTase. The remaining plasmid fragment was purified from the DNA fragment encoding the FPT β-subunit using a 1.2% agarose gel. The gene encoding the β-subunit of rat GGTase I was amplified from the plasmid pET28a-GGT-1 (33Zhang F.L. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

This PCR fragment was purified using a 1.2% agarose gel, digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and NdeI, and repurified to obtain the DNA encoding the β-subunit of GGTase I. This DNA fragment was ligated into the NdeI/EcoRI-digested pET23a-FPT plasmid using a ligation premix (Clonables, EMD Biosciences, San Diego) to generate the plasmid pET23a-GGPT. The plasmid was transformed into XL-1 Blue cells, and the cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 mg liter-1 ampicillin. The plasmid was purified using a Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The sequence of the entire gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing (University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core, Ann Arbor). Preparation of GGTase I—Recombinant rat GGTase I was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pET23a-GGPT cells and purified as described below. The cells were grown in rich induction medium (20 g liter-1 tryptone, 10 g liter-1 yeast extract, 5 g liter-1 NaCl, 50 mg liter-1 ampicillin, 1% glucose, 0.06 mm ZnSO4, 0.22 g liter-1 Na2HPO4, 0.11 g liter-1 KH2PO4, 0.036 g liter-1 NH4Cl, pH 7.35) at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8, induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and 0.5 mm ZnSO4, and incubated at 25 °C for 14 h (39Zimmerman K.K. Scholten J.D. Huang C.C. Hupe D.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 14: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The harvested cells were lysed using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, MA). The cell lysate from 2 liters of cells was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences, 30-ml bed volume) or DEAE-cellulose (Whatman, 100-ml bed volume) column preequilibrated with HTZ buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm TCEP, 10 μm ZnCl2). The column was run by gravity with a linear gradient (400 ml) from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in HTZ buffer. GGTase I eluted at 0.3 m NaCl. The fractions were tested for GGTase I activity using a 96-well plate format. Each well contained 50 mm Heppso, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm TCEP, 0.2 μm GGPP (Sigma), 1 μm dansylated GCVLL, and 10 μl of protein sample (100-μl total volume). The relative fluorescence of each fraction was measured after the addition of dansylated GCVLL by the Polarstar Galaxy fluorescence plate reader (BMG Laboratory Technologies, Durham, NC, λex = 280 nm, λem = 490 nm). Fractions containing GGTase I were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The protein was dialyzed against HTZ buffer overnight, then run over a Q-Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences, 40-ml bed volume) using fast protein liquid chromatography (AKTA Prime, Amersham Biosciences) with a 0–0.5 m NaCl step gradient (400 ml). The active fractions were again pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). The protein was then immediately loaded onto a Poros 20 HQ column (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA 1.7-ml bed volume) and fractionated using a step gradient at 0.1, 0.5, and 2 m NaCl (90 ml). The prepared GGTase I was determined by SDS-PAGE to be >90% pure. The protein was dialyzed against HT buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm TCEP), concentrated to 31 μm using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore), and frozen at -80 °C. Using these procedures, 15 mg of purified GGTase I was obtained from 1 liter of cell culture. Preparation of Mutant GGTase I—Mutagenesis of the pET23a-GGPT plasmid was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit with the following codon changes: Kβ311A, AAA to GCA, and Kβ311D, AAA to GAC. The changes were confirmed by DNA sequencing (University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core, Ann Arbor). Recombinant rat GGTase I mutants were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described above except that the Q-Sepharose HP column was omitted. Instead, after the DEAE-cellulose column, the active fractions were loaded onto a Poros 20 HQ column (Applied Biosystems, 20.2-ml bed volume) and fractionated with a linear gradient (800 ml) from 0.05 to 0.5 m NaCl in HTZ buffer. The active fractions were loaded immediately onto a second Poros 20 HQ column (Applied Biosystems, 7.9-ml bed volume) and fractionated with a step gradient at 0.1 and 0.5 m NaCl. GGPP Binding Affinity—The affinity of wild type GGTase I for GGPP and FPP and Lys-β311 GGTase I mutants for GGPP was determined by equilibrium dialysis (30Huang C.C. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2593-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 39Zimmerman K.K. Scholten J.D. Huang C.C. Hupe D.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 14: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A 1-ml solution containing 0.1–100 nm enzyme was preincubated with a constant concentration of [1-3H]GGPP or [1-3H]FPP (5, 10, or 20 nm) for 1 h at room temperature in buffer (50 mm Heppso, pH 7.8, and 1 mm TCEP). This solution was then dialyzed against a 1-ml solution of the same concentration of [1-3H]GGPP or [1-3H]FPP (5, 10, or 20 nm) in the same buffer using a 25,000 molecular weight cutoff dialysis membrane (Spectra/Por 7, Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA). After 20 h, the radioactivity in 100-μl samples from both sides of the membrane was quantified in triplicate by scintillation counting and averaged. The fraction of GGPP bound to GGTase I (E:GGPP) was determined by subtracting the counts on the [1-3H]GGPP side from the counts on the enzyme side, then dividing the difference by the total counts. The concentration of E:GGPP was calculated by multiplying the fraction of GGPP bound to E:GGPP by the initial [1-3H]GGPP concentration, [GGPP]total (5–20 nm). The [E]free was calculated by subtracting [E:GGPP] from [E]total. The dissociation constant, KD, was then determined by fitting Equation 1 to the dependence of E:GGPP/GGPPtotal on [E]free where EP refers to the fraction of GGPP bound to E:GGPP at saturation. The data were truncated at [E]free = 5KD.E:GGPPGGPPtotal=EP1+KD/[E]free(Eq. 1) Peptide Binding Affinity—The affinity of GGTase I and Lys-β311 GGTase I mutants for dansylated GCVLL was determined by fluorescence anisotropy (26Hightower K.E.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1999: 291-319Crossref Google Scholar), where the dansyl group of the peptide is excited at 340 nm (band pass = 16 nm), and its emission is monitored at 525 nm (band pass = 16 nm). The samples were prepared with 50 mm Heppso, pH 7.8, 2 mm TCEP, 2 nm dansylated GCVLL, and 10 nm EDTA. The samples were titrated with GGTase I (0–150 nm), and additional dansylated GCVLL was added to maintain the 2 nm concentration of peptide. For comparison, this titration was repeated in the presence of 1 μm 3-azageranylgeranyl diphosphate (42Sagami H. Korenaga T. Ogura K. Steiger A. Coates R.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, a gift from Robert Coates, University of Illinois), a nonhydrolyzable GGPP analog. As a control, both titrations were repeated using 2 nm iodoacetamide-treated dansylated GCVLL (which should not bind to GGTase I). All samples were incubated for 5 min without stirring prior to each measurement at 25 °C. A weighted fit of Equation 2 to the data yields the apparent dissociation constants where ΔA represents the observed fluorescence anisotropy at 525 nm corrected for background, EP is the fluorescence anisotropy end point, IF is the initial fluorescence anisotropy, [enzyme] is the concentration of GGTase I, and KDpeptide is the dissociation constant for dansylated GCVLL.ΔA=EP1+KDpeptide/[enzyme]+IF(Eq. 2) Transient Kinetics—Single turnover assays were performed for wild type and mutant GGTase I at multiple magnesium concentrations (0.0006–175 mm) in 50 mm Heppso, pH 7.8, 2 mm TCEP, with ionic strength kept constant at 0.2 m with NaCl up to 60 mm Mg(II) as described previously (31Saderholm M.J. Hightower K.E. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12398-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Reactions with prenylation rate constants less than 0.1 s-1 were performed manually using 0.8 μm GGTase I, 0.4 μm [1-3H]FPP or [1-3H]GGPP, and 100 μm peptide GCVLL (8-μl reaction volume). GGTase I was preincubated with [1-3H]FPP or [1-3H]-GGPP for 15 min at room temperature; the reaction was subsequently initiated by the addition of peptide. The reactions were quenched at varying times (3 s–1 h) by the addition of 8 μl of cold 80% isopropyl alcohol, 20% acetic acid (v/v) and placed on ice. For reactions with rate constants faster than 0.1 s-1, a KinTek rapid quench apparatus was used (KinTek Corporation, Austin, TX). The 30-μl reactions contained 0.8 μm GGTase I, 0.4 μm [1-3H]FPP or [1-3H]GGPP, and 100 μm peptide. The reactions were quenched with 80% isopropyl alcohol, 20% acetic acid at varying times (0.05–120 s), then dried under vacuum and resuspended in 50% isopropyl alcohol. The product was separated from substrate by TLC on polyester-backed silica gel plates (Whatman PE SIL G) with an 8:1:1 (v/v/v) isopropyl alcohol/NH4OH/H2O mobile phase. The product migrates in this mobile phase, but the GGPP substrate remains at the origin, so the plates were cut accordingly, and the radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. The radioactivity in the product was divided by the total radioactivity for each time point to calculate the fraction of product formed. The rate constant for product formation (kobs) was determined by fitting Equation 3 to the data, where Pt is the fraction product formed at time t, and P∞ is the calculated reaction end point, which varied from 60 to 90%.PtP∞=1−e−kobs*t(Eq. 3) The magnesium dependence was determined by measuring the single turnover rate constant, kobs, as a function of Mg(II) concentration. A weighted fit of Equation 4 to these data was used to determine: KMg, the apparent dissociation constant; kmaxMg, the rate constant of the reaction at saturating Mg(II) concentration; and k0, the rate constant of the reaction in the absence of magnesium.kobs=kmaxMg1+KMg/[Mg(II)]+k0(Eq. 4) The pH dependence of the single turnover rate constant was measured in 50 mm Bes (pH 6.1–7.0), 50 mm Heppso, pH 7.8–8.0, or 50 mm Bicine, pH 8.3–9.0; 2 mm TCEP was included as a reductant. Reactions were performed manually using 0.8 μm GGTase I, 0.4 μm [1-3H]GGPP, and 100 μm peptide (8-μl reaction volume) and analyzed as described above. The pKa of the react"
https://openalex.org/W2058400690,"Nitric oxide (NO) is thought to play an important role as a signaling molecule in embryonic and adult cardiomyocytes; however, its involvement in muscarinic signaling is still unclear. The aim of the present work was to analyze the muscarinic modulation of the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa) in early- and late-stage embryonic ventricular cardiomyocytes. Muscarinic stimulation depressed basal ICa by 30.1 +/- 3.2% (n=27) in early-stage cardiomyocytes. Pharmacological evidence suggested that the muscarinic modulation was mediated through generation of NO, activation of cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterase (PDE) 2, and ensuing lowering of cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) levels. Conversely, in late-stage cardiomyocytes, muscarinic regulation of ICa occurred in a NO-independent manner via inhibition of prestimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC). To unequivocally prove the involvement of NO and to identify the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoform(s), we analyzed muscarinic signaling in embryonic ventricular cardiomyocytes of NOS2 (-/-) and NOS3 (-/-) mice. The early-stage NOS3 (-/-) cardiomyocytes lacked muscarinic modulation, whereas it was preserved in NOS2 (-/-) cells. Moreover, at the late embryonic stage, muscarinic modulation of ICa was intact in both strains. Thus, NO is the key regulator of muscarinic signaling in the early embryonic ventricle, whereas at later stages, signaling occurs through a NO-independent pathway."
