https://openalex.org/W2866327061,"Earthquake prediction has been a challenging research area, where a future occurrence of the devastating catastrophe is predicted. In this work, sixty seismic features are computed through employing seismological concepts, such as Gutenberg-Richter law, seismic rate changes, foreshock frequency, seismic energy release, total recurrence time. Further, Maximum Relevance and Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) criteria is applied to extract the relevant features. A Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and Hybrid Neural Network (HNN) based classification system is built to obtain the earthquake predictions. HNN is a step wise combination of three different Neural Networks, supported by Enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO), to offer weight optimization at each layer. The newly computed seismic features in combination with SVR-HNN prediction system is applied on Hindukush, Chile and Southern California regions. The obtained numerical results show improved prediction performance for all the considered regions, compared to previous prediction studies."
https://openalex.org/W2818295771,"Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are widely used in various food products and soft drinks. There is growing evidence that NNSs contribute to metabolic dysfunction and can affect body weight, glucose tolerance, appetite, and taste sensitivity. Several NNSs have also been shown to have major impacts on bacterial growth both in vitro and in vivo. Here we studied the effects of various NNSs on the growth of the intestinal bacterium, E. coli, as well as the gut bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, the balance between which is associated with gut health. We found that the synthetic sweeteners acesulfame potassium, saccharin and sucralose all exerted strong bacteriostatic effects. We found that rebaudioside A, the active ingredient in the natural NNS stevia, also had similar bacteriostatic properties, and the bacteriostatic effects of NNSs varied among different Escherichia coli strains. In mice fed a chow diet, sucralose increased Firmicutes, and we observed a synergistic effect on Firmicutes when sucralose was provided in the context of a high-fat diet. In summary, our data show that NNSs have direct bacteriostatic effects and can change the intestinal microbiota in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2833770954,"Conservation of large carnivores, such as the African lion, requires preservation of extensive core habitat areas, linkages between them, and mitigation of human-wildlife conflict. However, there are few rigorous examples of efforts that prioritized conservation actions for all three of these critical components. We used an empirically optimized resistance surface to calculate resistant kernel and factorial least cost path predictions of population connectivity and conflict risk for lions across the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA) and surrounding landscape. We mapped and ranked the relative importance of (1) lion dispersal areas outside National Parks, (2) corridors between the key areas, and (3) areas of highest human-lion conflict risk. Spatial prioritization of conservation actions is critical given extensive land use redesignations that are reducing the extent and increasing the fragmentation of lion populations. While our example focuses on lions in southern Africa, it provides a general approach for rigorous, empirically based comprehensive conservation planning based on spatial prioritization."

Concurrently, major efforts are in place to quantify changes in biodiversity, to understand the consequences for ecosystem functioning and human wellbeing, and to develop sustainable management strategies. Based on comprehensive bibliometric analyses covering 134,321 publications, we report systematic spatial biases in biodiversity-related research. Research is dominated by wealthy countries, while major research deficits occur in regions with disproportionately high biodiversity as well as a high share of threatened species. Similarly, core scientists, who were assessed through their publication impact, work primarily in North America and Europe. Though they mainly exchange and collaborate across locations of these two continents, the connectivity among them has increased with time. Finally, biodiversity-related research has primarily focused on terrestrial systems, plants, and the species level, and is frequently conducted in Europe and Asia by researchers affiliated with European and North American institutions. The distinct spatial imbalances in biodiversity research, as demonstrated here, must be filled, research capacity built, particularly in the Global South, and spatially-explicit biodiversity data bases improved, curated and shared."
https://openalex.org/W2876750881,"Immune evasion by tumors includes several different mechanisms, including the inefficiency of antigen presenting cells (APCs) to trigger anti-tumor T cell responses. B lymphocytes may display a pro-tumoral role but can also be modulated to function as antigen presenting cells to T lymphocytes, capable of triggering anti-cancer immune responses. While dendritic cells, DCs, are the best APC population to activate naive T cells, DCs or their precursors, monocytes, are frequently modulated by tumors, displaying a tolerogenic phenotype in cancer patients. In patients with cervical cancer, we observed that monocyte derived DCs are tolerogenic, inhibiting allogeneic T cell activation compared to the same population obtained from patients with precursor lesions or cervicitis. In this work, we show that B lymphocytes from cervical cancer patients respond to treatment with sCD40L and IL-4 by increasing the CD80+CD86+ population, therefore potentially increasing their ability to activate T cells. To test if B lymphocytes could actually trigger anti-tumor T cell responses, we designed an experimental model where we harvested T and B lymphocytes, or dendritic cells, from tumor bearing donors, and after APC stimulation, transplanted them, together with T cells into RAG1-/- recipients, previously injected with tumor cells. We were able to show that anti-CD40 activated B lymphocytes could trigger secondary T cell responses, dependent on MHC-II expression. Moreover, we showed that dendritic cells were resistant to the anti-CD40 treatment and unable to stimulate anti-tumor responses. In summary, our results suggest that B lymphocytes may be used as a tool for immunotherapy against cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2872234236,"Acute exacerbations are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Rhinovirus, which causes acute exacerbations may also accelerate progression of lung disease in these patients. Current therapies reduces the respiratory symptoms and does not treat the root cause of exacerbations effectively. We hypothesized that quercetin, a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent with antiviral properties may be useful in treating rhinovirus-induced changes in COPD. Mice with COPD phenotype maintained on control or quercetin diet and normal mice were infected with sham or rhinovirus, and after 14 days mice were examined for changes in lung mechanics and lung inflammation. Rhinovirus-infected normal mice showed no changes in lung mechanics or histology. In contrast, rhinovirus-infected mice with COPD phenotype showed reduction in elastic recoiling and increase in lung inflammation, goblet cell metaplasia, and airways cholinergic responsiveness compared to sham-infected mice. Interestingly, rhinovirus-infected mice with COPD phenotype also showed accumulation of neutrophils, CD11b+/CD11c+ macrophages and CD8+ T cells in the lungs. Quercetin supplementation attenuated rhinovirus-induced all the pathologic changes in mice with COPD phenotype. Together these results indicate that quercetin effectively mitigates rhinovirus-induced progression of lung disease in a mouse model of COPD. Therefore, quercetin may be beneficial in the treatment of rhinovirus-associated exacerbations and preventing progression of lung disease in COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2817478800,"Background The study was aimed at determining the effect of plasma chromium concentration on the metabolism of glucose, and lipids and their subsequent cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes in the Bolgatanga district of Ghana. Material and methods Fasting blood glucose and lipids profile were determined by enzymatic assay using the BT 5000® Random Access Chemistry Analyzer. Fasting serum insulin and High sensitive C-reactive protein were determined by ELISA, a solid phase direct sandwich immunoassay method. HOMA-IR, which is based on fasting blood sample for insulin and glucose concentrations measured in a single blood sample, was used to calculate insulin resistance. Plasma chromium was measured using an atomic Absorption Spectrometer. Results Patientswith diabeteshad significantly (p<0.0001) increased LDL, TC, TG, VLDL, insulin, CRP and HOMAIR and a significantly reduced plasma chromium (p<0.0001) (0.53± 0.02μg/l and 0.11±0.01μg/l control and case respectively). Low Cr (p ≤0.001) was associated with high blood pressure, obesity and lipid dysregulation. Plasma Cr significantly correlated negatively with blood pressure and LDL. Conclusion Lower plasma Cr level was associated with hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, insulin resistance and high inflammation marker HsCRP."
https://openalex.org/W2874314288,"Nassella trichotoma (Nees) Hack. ex Arechav. (Serrated tussock) is an aggressive globally significant weed to agricultural and natural ecosystems. Herbicide resistant populations of this C3 perennial weed have emerged, increasing the need for effective wide-scale cultural control strategies. A thorough seed ecology study on two spatially distinct populations of N. trichotoma was conducted on this weed to identify differences in important environmental factors (drought, salinity, alternating temperature, photoperiod, burial depth, soil pH, artificial seed aging, and radiant heat) which influence seed dormancy. Seeds were collected from two spatially distinct populations; Gnarwarre (38 O 9' 8.892'' S, 144 O 7' 38.784'' E) and Ingliston (37O 40' 4.44'' S, 144 O 18' 39.24'' E) in December 2016 and February 2017, respectively. Twenty sterilized seeds were placed into Petri dishes lined with a single Whatman® No. 10 filter paper dampened with the relevant treatments solution and then incubated under the identified optimal alternating temperature and photoperiod regime of 25°C/15°C (light/dark, 12h/12h). For the burial depth treatment, 20 seeds were placed into plastic containers (10cm in diameter and 6cm in depth) and buried to the relevant depth in sterilized soil. All trials were monitored for 30 days and germination was indicated by 5mm exposure of the radicle and emergence was indicated by the exposure of the cotyledon. Each treatment had three replicates for each population, and each treatment was repeated to give a total of six replicates per treatment, per population. Nassella trichotoma was identified to be non-photoblastic, with germination (%) being similar under alternating light and dark and complete darkness conditions. With an increase of osmotic potential and salinity, a significant decline in germination was observed. There was no effect of pH on germination. Exposure to a radiant heat of 120°C for 9 minutes resulted in the lowest germination in the Ingliston population (33%) and the Gnarwarre population (60%). In the burial depth treatment, the Ingliston population and the Gnarwarre population had highest emergence of 75% and 80%, respectively at a depth of 1cm. Variation between the two populations was observed for the burial depth treatments; Gnarwarre had greater emergence than Ingliston from the 4cm burial depth, while Ingliston had greater emergence at the soil surface than Gnarwarre. The Gnarwarre population had greater overall germination than Ingliston, which could be attributed to the greater seed mass (0.86mg compared to 0.76mg, respectively). This study identifies that spatial variations in N. trichotoma’s seed ecology are present between spatially distinct populations."
https://openalex.org/W2819222535,"Sighted people predominantly use vision to navigate spaces, and sight loss has negative consequences for independent navigation and mobility. The recent proliferation of devices that can extract 3D spatial information from visual scenes opens up the possibility of using such mobility-relevant information to assist blind and visually impaired people by presenting this information through modalities other than vision. In this work, we present two new methods for encoding visual scenes using spatial audio: simulated echolocation and distance-dependent hum volume modulation. We implemented both methods in a virtual reality (VR) environment and tested them using a 3D motion-tracking device. This allowed participants to physically walk through virtual mobility scenarios, generating data on real locomotion behaviour. Blindfolded sighted participants completed two tasks: maze navigation and obstacle avoidance. Results were measured against a visual baseline in which participants performed the same two tasks without blindfolds. Task completion time, speed and number of collisions were used as indicators of successful navigation, with additional metrics exploring detailed dynamics of performance. In both tasks, participants were able to navigate using only audio information after minimal instruction. While participants were 65% slower using audio compared to the visual baseline, they reduced their audio navigation time by an average 21% over just 6 trials. Hum volume modulation proved over 20% faster than simulated echolocation in both mobility scenarios, and participants also showed the greatest improvement with this sonification method. Nevertheless, we do speculate that simulated echolocation remains worth exploring as it provides more spatial detail and could therefore be more useful in more complex environments. The fact that participants were intuitively able to successfully navigate space with two new visual-to-audio mappings for conveying spatial information motivates the further exploration of these and other mappings with the goal of assisting blind and visually impaired individuals with independent mobility."
https://openalex.org/W2837347123,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and deadly form of adult brain cancer. Despite of many attempts to identify potential therapies for this disease, including promising cancer immunotherapy approaches, it remains incurable. To address the need of improved persistence, expansion, and optimal antitumor activity of T-cells in the glioma milieu, we have developed an EGFRvIII-specific third generation (G3-EGFRvIII) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that expresses both co-stimulatory factors CD28 and OX40 (MR1-CD8TM-CD28-OX40-CD3ζ). To enhance ex vivo target specific activation and optimize T-cell culturing conditions, we generated artificial antigen presenting cell lines (aAPC) expressing the extracellular and transmembrane domain of EGFRvIII (EGFRVIIIΔ654) with costimulatory molecules including CD32, CD80 and 4-1BBL (EGFRVIIIΔ654 aAPC and CD32-80-137L-EGFRVIIIΔ654 aAPC). We demonstrate that the highest cell growth was achieved when G3-EGFRvIII CAR T-cells were cocultured with both co-stimulatory aAPCs and with exposure to EGFRvIII (CD32-80-137L-EGFRVIIIΔ654 aAPCs) in culturing periods of three to six weeks. G3-EGFRvIII CAR T-cells showed an increased level of IFN-γ when cocultured with CD32-80-137L-EGFRVIIIΔ654 aAPCs. Evaluation of G3-EGFRvIII CAR T-cells in an orthotropic human glioma xenograft model demonstrated a prolonged survival of G3-EGFRvIII CAR treated mice compared to control mice. Importantly, we observed survival of G3-EGFRvIII CAR T-cells within the tumor as long as 90 days after implantation in low-dose and single administration, accompanied by a marked tumor stroma demolition. These findings suggest that G3-EGFRvIII CAR cocultured with CD32-80-137L-EGFRVIIIΔ654 aAPCs warrants itself as a potential anti-tumor therapy strategy for glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2870370807,"Background Sex workers in South Africa are exposed to high levels of violence, yet little is known about their mental health needs. This study aims to understanding the prevalence of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and their risk factors amongst female sex worker (FSWs) in Soweto, South Africa. Methods A cross-sectional, respondent-driven sampling (RDS) survey enrolled 508 FSWs. Raw and RDS adjusted data were analyzed using a chi-squared test of association and multinomial regression for risk factors associated with depression and PTSD. Findings Symptoms of severe depression were prevalent amongst 68.7%, PTSD was 39.6%, and 32.7% suffered from comorbid PTSD and depression. Experiencing ≥3 kinds of violence increased the likelihood of comorbidity (RRR4.11, 95% CI 1.52–11.12,p = 0.005). Internalised stigma increased the likelihood of one mental health condition (RRR1.25, 95% CI 1.10–1.42,p = 0.001), higher self-esteem was associated with independent (RRR1.14, 95% CI 1.05–1.25,p = 0.002) and comorbid conditions (RRR1.17, 95% CI 1.07–1.27,p = 0.001). Conclusion Our findings highlight the sizable burden of treatable mental health conditions among FSWs in Soweto. This was driven by multiple exposures to violence, sex work related discrimination and overall moderate levels of self-esteem masking defence mechanisms. This suggests the urgent need to design and integrate services geared to the mental health needs for this population."
https://openalex.org/W2882172610,"False banana /Ensete ventricosum [Welw.] Cheesman/ is exploited as a food crop in Ethiopia where it represents an important staple food. The plant is harvested and large amounts of biomass residues are originated, mainly from the pseudo stem (i.e., fiber bundles obtained from the leaf sheaths after being scrapped to produce starchy food) and the inflorescence stalk. These materials were studied in relation to their summative chemical composition, composition of lignin, lipophilic and polar extracts. Moreover, their structural characteristics, in view of their valorization, were scrutinized. The analytical studies were performed with the aid of FTIR, GC/MS, Py-GC/MS and SEM. The fiber bundles are aggregates of mainly long and slender fibers with low ash, extractives and lignin contents (3.8%. 4.4% and 10.5% respectively) and high holocellulose and α-cellulose contents (87.5% and 59.6% respectively). The hemicelluloses in the fibers are mostly highly acetylated xylans and the lignin is of the H-type (H:G:S, 1:0.7:0.8). This lignin composition is in line with the FTIR peaks at 1670 cm-1 and 1250 cm-1.The inflorescence stalk has high ash content (12.3% in the main stalk and 24.6% in fines) with a major proportion of potassium, high extractives (25.9%), and low lignin and α-cellulose contents (5.8% and 17.9% respectively). The stalk includes numerous starch granules in the cellular structure with the predominant presence of parenchyma. The potential valorization routes for these materials are clearly different. The fiber bundles could be used as a fiber source for paper pulp production with the possibility of a prior hemicelluloses removal while the inflorescence stalk has nutritional value for food and fodder. Furthermore, it can also be used for sugar fermentation products."
https://openalex.org/W2837352954,"Chronic exposure of tubular renal cells to high glucose contributes to tubulointerstitial changes in diabetic nephropathy. In the present study, we identified a new fibrosis gene called galectin-1 (Gal-1), which is highly expressed in tubular cells of kidneys of type 1 and type 2 diabetic mouse models. Gal-1 protein and mRNA expression showed significant increase in kidney cortex of heterozygous Akita+/− and db/db mice compared with wild-type mice. Mouse proximal tubular cells exposed to high glucose showed significant increase in phosphorylation of Akt and Gal-1. We cloned Gal-1 promoter and identified the transcription factor AP4 as binding to the Gal-1 promoter to up-regulate its function. Transfection of cells with plasmid carrying mutations in the binding sites of AP4 to Gal-1 promoter resulted in decreased protein function of Gal-1. In addition, inhibition of Gal-1 by OTX-008 showed significant decrease in p-Akt/AP4 and protein-promoter activity of Gal-1 and fibronectin. Moreover, down-regulation of AP4 by small interfering RNA resulted in a significant decrease in protein expression and promoter activity of Gal-1. We found that kidney of Gal-1−/− mice express very low levels of fibronectin protein. In summary, Gal-1 is highly expressed in kidneys of type 1 and 2 diabetic mice, and AP4 is a major transcription factor that activates Gal-1 under hyperglycemia. Inhibition of Gal-1 by OTX-008 blocks activation of Akt and prevents accumulation of Gal-1, suggesting a novel role of Gal-1 inhibitor as a possible therapeutic target to treat renal fibrosis in diabetes.—Al-Obaidi, N., Mohan, S., Liang, S., Zhao, Z., Nayak, B.

https://openalex.org/W2872372362,"It is well established that bariatric surgery, the most effective method to achieve long-term weight loss in obese subjects, reverses enhanced preference and intake of sweet/fatty foods. Although taste and odor preference changes following bariatric surgery have been previously described, their time course and relationship to weight loss remains an issue. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between taste and odor preference changes and successful weight loss following bariatric surgery. A cross-sectional study was performed on 195 human subjects with body mass index (BMI) above 30 (at least class I obesity), who were scheduled to receive (n = 54) or had previously received (n = 141) Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). A Self-Assessment Manikin test was used to measure each participant’s affective reaction (ranging from pleasure to displeasure) to a variety of food-related and odor-related pictures. Results confirmed earlier reports about changes in sweet/fatty foods preference after surgery and revealed a shift in preference toward less calorie-dense foods. Relatedly, endorsements of “favorite” foods were mostly sweet/fatty foods in subjects awaiting surgery but were shifted toward more healthy choices, particularly vegetables, in subjects post-RYGB surgery. However, food preference ratings trended toward pre-surgical levels as the time since surgery increased. Answers to open-ended questions about why their diet changed post-surgery revealed that changes in cravings, rather than changes in taste per se, were the major factor. Surprisingly, patients rating a coffee taste as more pleasing after surgery had a lower post-surgical BMI. No associations of odors with change in BMI were apparent. Results showed that following bariatric surgery taste preferences are significantly altered and that these changes correlate with lowered BMI. However, these changes fade as time since surgery lengthens. These results may suggest diagnostic criteria to identify people at risk for less than optimal changes in BMI following bariatric surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2878678072,"This contribution presents the forelimb muscular arrangement of sauropodomorph dinosaurs as inferred by comparisons with living archosaurs (crocodiles and birds) following the Extant Phylogenetic Bracket approach. Forty-one muscles were reconstructed, including lower limb and manus musculature, which prior information available was scarce for sauropodomorphs. A strong emphasis was placed on osteological correlates (such as tubercles, ridges and striae) and comparisons with primitive archosauromorphs are included in order to track these correlates throughout the clade. This should help to elucidate how widespread among other archosaurian groups are these osteological correlates identified in Sauropodomorpha. The ultimate goal of this contribution was to provide an exhaustive guide to muscular identification in fossil archosaurs and to offer solid anatomical bases for future studies based on osteology, myology, functional morphology and systematics."
https://openalex.org/W2845271666,"Research on the optical properties of animal integuments, including fur, feather, skin and cuticle, has focussed almost exclusively on animal-visible wavelengths within the narrow range of 300–700 nm. By contrast, the near-infrared (NIR) portion of direct sunlight, spanning 700–2600 nm, has been largely ignored despite its potentially important thermal consequences. We quantified variation in visible and NIR reflectance and transmission for white body contour feathers of 50 bird species, and examined how well they are predicted by feather macro- and micro-structural morphology. Both visible and NIR reflectance of the feathers varied substantially across species. Larger, thicker, and sparser feathers that are characteristic of larger species, and feathers with rounder barbs and more closely spaced barbules, had high average reflectance, particularly within avian-visible wavelengths (300–700 nm). Feathers with rounder barbs and more closely situated barbules also had high average reflectance, particularly for NIR wavelengths. Barb roundness and barbule density were the only predictors of NIR reflectance after accounting for variation in visible reflectance and body size. Our results highlight the potential for adaptive variation in NIR reflectance mediated by feather structure, which may inform the design of functional materials to control light and heat."
https://openalex.org/W2821446135,"This paper compares land use patterns of mestizo colonists and indigenous populations in the central Ecuadorian Amazon, based on data from a household survey covering mestizo colonist, Kichwa and Shuar households. As expected, colonists mostly engage in commercial agriculture and cattle ranching, but there are substantial differences in land use patterns between the Shuar and the Kichwa. The Shuar engage in cash cropping and cattle ranching, and on average, devote even more land to agricultural uses than mestizo colonists in this sample. In contrast, the Kichwa engage more in subsistence crop production and less in commercial agriculture. Such different patterns appear related to local conditions, earlier migratory and settlement patterns, and the level of exposure to markets. The implications of this for policy are explored in the conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2821058813,"Knowledge of the host range of a biocontrol agent (BCA) is fundamental. Host range determines the BCA's economic potential, as well as the possible risk for non-target organisms. Entomopathogenic fungal strains belonging to the genus Beauveria are widely used as BCA, but our knowledge of their physiological host range is only partial. The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of the physiological host range of three Beauveria strains belonging to two species, B. hoplocheli and B. bassiana. We performed laboratory mortality bioassays to assess their pathogenicity and virulence against nine insect pests, belonging to three orders: Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera. Mortality rate, mean survival time and mycosis rate were used to estimate virulence. Pathogenicity was assessed as the capacity to cause a disease and induce mortality. Virulence was assessed as the severity of the disease based on mortality rate, mean survival time and mycosis rate. The results of this study revealed significant differences in the physiological host range of the three Beauveria strains tested. The three strains were pathogenic to all Diptera and Lepidoptera species tested. In the case of the Coleoptera, only the B. hoplocheli strain was pathogenic to the white grub Hoplochelus marginalis and only the B. bassiana strains were pathogenic to Alphitobius diaperinus. The B. hoplocheli strain was less virulent on Lepidoptera and Diptera than the two B. bassiana strains. The latter both exhibited very similar virulence patterns. The fact that B. hoplocheli and B. bassiana strains have different host ranges means that they can be used as BCA to target different pests. Impacts on non-target insects across multiple orders cannot be ruled out in the absence of ecological host range studies."
https://openalex.org/W2824237925,"Background Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) of the chest for lung cancer screening of heavy smokers was given a ‘B’ rating by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2013, and gained widespread insurance coverage in the U.S. in 2015. Lung cancer screening has since had low uptake. However, for those that do choose to screen, little is known about patient motivations for completing screening in real-world practice. Objective To explore the motivations for screening-eligible patients to screen for lung cancer. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 LDCT screen-completed men and women who were members of an integrated mixed-model healthcare system in Washington State. From June to September 2015, participants were recruited and individual interviews performed about motivations to screen for lung cancer. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed using inductive content analysis by three investigators. Results Four primary themes emerged as motivations for completing LDCT lung cancer screening: 1) trust in the referring clinician; 2) early-detection benefit; 3) low or limited harm perception; and 4) friends or family with advanced cancer. Conclusion Participants in our study were primarily motivated to screen for lung cancer based on perceived benefit of early-detection, absence of safety concerns, and personal relationships. Our findings provide new insights about patient motivations to screen, and can potentially be used to improve lung cancer screening uptake and shared decision-making processes."

TMSC were isolated from tonsil tissues of children undergoing tonsillectomy, and TMSC-embedded in situ crosslinkable gelatin-hydroxyphenyl propionic acid hydrogel (TMSC-GHH) or TMSC alone were delivered subcutaneously to the dorsa of OVX mice. After 3 months, three-dimensionally reconstructed micro-computed tomographic images revealed better recovery of the femoral heads in OVX mice treated with TMSC-GHH. Serum osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase were also recovered, indicating bone formation only in TMSC-GHH-treated mice, and absence in hypercalcemia or other severe macroscopic deformities showed biocompatibility of TMSC-GHH. Additionally, visceral fat reduction effects by TMSC-GHH further supported their therapeutic potential. TMSC provided therapeutic benefits toward osteoporosis only when embedded in GHH, and showed potential as a supplement or alternative to current therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2833836261,"Twenty male Saanen goats were randomly assigned to four levels of lovastatin supplementation and used to determine the optimal dosage and sustainability of naturally produced lovastatin from fermentation of palm kernel cake (PKC) with Aspergillus terreus on enteric methane (CH4) mitigation. The effects on ruminal microbiota, rumen fermentation, feed digestibility and health of animal were determined over three measuring periods (4-, 8- and 12-weeks) and the accumulation of lovastatin in tissues was determined at the end of the experiment. The diets contained 50% rice straw, 22.8% concentrates and 27.2% of various proportions of untreated or treated PKC to achieve the target daily intake level of 0 (Control), 2, 4 or 6 mg lovastatin/kg body weight (BW). Enteric CH4 emissions per dry matter intake (DMI), decreased significantly (P<0.05) and equivalent to 11% and 20.4%, respectively, for the 2 and 4 mg/kg BW groups as compared to the Control. No further decrease in CH4 emission thereafter with higher lovastatin supplementation. Lovastatin had no effect on feed digestibility and minor effect on rumen microbiota, and specifically did not reduce the populations of total methanogens and Methanobacteriales (responsible for CH4 production). Similarly, lovastatin had little effect on rumen fermentation characteristics except that the proportion of propionate increased, which led to a decreasing trend (P<0.08) in acetic: propionate ratio with increasing dosage of lovastatin. This suggests a shift in rumen fermentation pathway to favor propionate production which serves as H+ sink, partly explaining the observed CH4 reduction. No adverse physiological effects were noted in the animals except that treated PKC (containing lovastatin) was less palatable at the highest inclusion level. Lovastatin residues were detected in tissues of goats fed 6 mg lovastatin/kg BW at between 0.01 to 0.03 μg/g, which are very low."
https://openalex.org/W2845593847,"The neurodevelopmental consequences of deafness on the functional neuroarchitecture of the conceptual system have not been intensively investigated so far. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we therefore identified brain areas involved in conceptual processing in deaf and hearing participants. Conceptual processing was probed by a pictorial animacy decision task. Furthermore, brain areas sensitive to observing verbal signs and to observing non-verbal visual hand actions were identified in deaf participants. In hearing participants, brain areas responsive to environmental sounds and the observation of visual hand actions were determined. We found a stronger recruitment of superior and middle temporal cortex in deaf compared to hearing participants during animacy decisions. This region, which forms auditory cortex in hearing people according to the sound listening task, was also activated in deaf participants, when they observed sign language, but not when they observed non-verbal hand actions. These results indicate that conceptual processing in deaf people more strongly depends on language representations compared to hearing people. Furthermore, additionally enhanced activation in visual and motor areas of deaf versus hearing participants during animacy decisions and a more frequent report of visual and motor features in the property listing task suggest that the loss of the auditory channel is partially compensated by an increased importance of visual and motor information for constituting object knowledge. Hence, our results indicate that conceptual processing in deaf compared to hearing people is more strongly based on the language system, complemented by an enhanced contribution of the visuo-motor system."
https://openalex.org/W2868229285,"Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is envisaged as a powerful approach to improve the utilization of scarce radio spectrum resources, but it is threatened by Byzantine attack. Byzantine attack has been becoming a popular research topic in both academia and industry due to the demanding requirements of security. Extensive research mainly aims at mitigating the negative effect of Byzantine attack on CSS, but with some strong assumptions, such as attackers are in minority or trusted node(s) exist for data fusion, while paying little attention to a mobile scenario. This paper focuses on the issue of designing a general and reliable reference for CSS in a mobile network. Instead of the previously simplified attack, we develop a generic Byzantine attack model from sophisticated behaviors to conduct various attack strategies and derive the condition of which Byzantine attack makes the fusion center (FC) blind. Specifically, we propose a robust sequential CSS (SCSS) against dynamic Byzantine attack. Our proposed method solves the unreliability of the FC by means of delivery-based assessment to check consistency of individual sensing report, and innovatively reuses the sensing information from Byzantines via a novel weight allocation mechanism. Furthermore, trust value (TrV) ranking is exploited to proceed with a sequential test which generates a more accurate decision about the presence of phenomenon with fewer samples. Lastly, we carry out simulations on comparison of existing data fusion technologies and SCSS under dynamic Byzantine attack, and results verify the theoretical analysis and effectiveness of our proposed approach. We also conduct numerical analyses to demonstrate explicit impacts of secondary user (SU) density and mobility on the performance of SCSS."
https://openalex.org/W2880054379,"Female sex workers (FSW) are a socially and economically marginalized population heavily affected by HIV. Community empowerment approaches focus on FSW taking collective action to address structural barriers to their health and have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing HIV risk. This study examines the potential for community savings groups (locally called michezo) among FSW in Iringa, Tanzania to reduce HIV risk and promote economic and community empowerment. We conducted 27 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 15 FSW over time and 4 focus group discussions (FGDs) with 35 FSW participating in michezo, and 10 key informant interviews (KIIs) with group collectors. Content analysis was used to identify salient themes around participants' sex work and financial realities; the role of savings groups in their lives and work; and experiences with social cohesion associated with group participation. Michezo were described as providing a safety net for times of financial need, allowing FSW to create greater financial security for themselves and their families. Participation in the groups was also reported to facilitate both individual agency, resulting in members' ability to negotiate condom use and be selective about clients, and a sense of collective identity and solidarity. Participants described group challenges including high mobility and low income of FSW making it difficult for women to fulfill their financial obligations to the group. As a result, participants reported preferences for joining michezo whose members were perceived as more stable (e.g. older, married, from more established venues). Group collectors and members were eager to have michezo formally registered and become recognized by the broader community. Findings indicate that savings groups promote individual agency to reduce sexual risk behaviors and foster community empowerment among FSW. The groups hold potential as an empowerment strategy to enable sex workers to address structural sources of HIV vulnerability and help them achieve socioeconomic inclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2953143720,"Synaptic plasticity, the cellular basis for learning and memory, is mediated by a complex biochemical network of signaling proteins. These proteins are compartmentalized in dendritic spines, the tiny, bulbous, post-synaptic structures found on neuronal dendrites. The ability to screen a high number of molecular targets for their effect on dendritic spine structural plasticity will require a high-throughput imaging system capable of stimulating and monitoring hundreds of dendritic spines in various conditions. For this purpose, we present a program capable of automatically identifying dendritic spines in live, fluorescent tissue. Our software relies on a machine learning approach to minimize any need for parameter tuning from the user. Custom thresholding and binarization functions serve to “clean” fluorescent images, and a neural network is trained using features based on the relative shape of the spine perimeter and its corresponding dendritic backbone. Our algorithm is rapid, flexible, has over 90% accuracy in spine detection, and bundled with our user-friendly, open-source, MATLAB-based software package for spine analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2821946465,"Objective To evaluate the influence of seasonal variation on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome in a large cohort population. Methods & materials A total of 5,765 IVF cycles conducted in Sheba medical center between 2013 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The treatment cycles included 4214 ovarian stimulation and ovum pick up (OPU) cycles of which 3020 resulted in fresh embryo transfer and 1551 vitrified- warmed cycles of which1400 resulted in warmed embryo transfer. Cycles were assigned to seasons according to the date of OPU for fresh embryo transfer cycles or according to the date of embryo warming for vitrified warmed embryo transfer cycles. Results There were no statistically significant differences between the calendar months or seasons concerning the number of oocytes retrieved or fertilization rate in the fresh cycles. Throughout the 4 years of the study, the monthly clinical pregnancy rate fluctuated between 18.2% and 27.9% per fresh embryo transfer (mean 23.3%) and between 17.7% and 29.4% per vitrified warmed embryo transfer (mean 23%). These fluctuations did not follow any specific seasonal pattern. Conclusions Our study did not demonstrate any significant influence of the calendar months or seasons on the clinical pregnancy rates of fresh or vitrified warmed embryo transfers. It might be speculated that the complete pharmaceutical control of the ovarian and endometrial function, as well as the homogeneous treatments, procedures and laboratory equipment used during the study period have lowered the influence of seasonal effect on IVF treatment outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2835624830,"Given research suggesting that social interactions are beneficial, it is unclear why individuals lower in extraversion engage less in social interactions. In this study, we test whether individuals lower in extraversion reap fewer hedonic rewards from social interactions and explore social psychological processes that explain their experiences. Before participants socialized, we measured extraversion, state positive affect, cognitive capacity, and expectations about the social interactions. After participants socialized with one another, we measured state positive affect and cognitive capacity again as well as fear of negative evaluation and belief in limited cognitive capacity. Participants also rated the social skillfulness of each interaction partner. We found that less extraverted individuals expect to feel worse after socializing. However, all but those extremely low in extraversion (17% of sample) actually experience an increase in positive affect after socializing. Surprisingly, those low in extraversion did not show reduced cognitive capacity after socializing. Although they are more likely to believe that cognitive capacity is limited and to be fearful of negative evaluation, these characteristics did not explain the social experience of those low in extraversion."
https://openalex.org/W2845236199,"Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) is an obligate biotrophic fungus that causes wheat powdery mildew, which is a devastating disease in wheat. However, little is known about the pathogenesis of this fungus, and differences in the pathogenesis of the same pathogen at various resistance levels in hosts have not been determined. In the present study, leaf tissues of both Pm40-expressing hexaploid wheat line L658 and its Pm40-deficient sister line L958 were harvested at 0 (without inoculation), 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-inoculation (hpi) with Bgt race 15 and then subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). In addition, we also observed changes in fungal growth morphology at the aforementioned time points. There was a high correlation between percentage of reads mapped to the Bgt reference genome and biomass of the fungus within the leaf tissue during the growth process. The percentage of mapped reads of Bgt in compatible interactions was significantly higher (at the p<0.05 level) than that of reads in incompatible interactions from 24 to 72 hpi. Further functional annotations indicated that expression levels of genes encoding H+-transporting ATPase, putative secreted effector proteins (PSEPs) and heat shock proteins (HSPs) were significantly up-regulated in compatible interactions compared with these levels in incompatible interactions, particularly at 72 hpi. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis suggested that genes involved in the endocytosis pathway were also enriched in compatible interactions. Overall, genes encoding H+-transporting ATPase, PSEPs and HSPs possibly played crucial roles in successfully establishing the pathogenesis of compatible interactions during late stages of inoculation. The study results also indicated that endocytosis is likely to play a potential role in Bgt in establishing compatible interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2824070552,"Objective To estimate the prevalence of anal HPV infection, genotype distribution, intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) and correlates in a cohort of HIV-infected patients attending at Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) clinic in Brazil. Study design A descriptive analysis was performed which includes, demographic, behavioral and clinical data. Anal specimens from HIV-positive men and women were collected during a regular visit and they were used for cytology and histopathology tests, as well as for HPV molecular identification. Results A total of 223 patients (143 females and 80 males) were enrolled in the study and, HPV was identified in 68.6% of the sample. The frequency of HR-HPV, HPV16/18 and multiple HPV infection were similar in both groups. The upstream regulatory region (URR) sequencing was carried out in 38 samples identified as HPV16-positive, and European variants were the most frequent (69.2%), followed by Africans (25.6%) and Asiatic-Americans (5.1%). Having more than 20 sexual partners was associated with multiple HPV infection (p = 0.000) while, anal sex and the first intercourse before 15 years of age was a risk factor for any HPV infection (p = 0.001). Being MSM (men who have sex with men) was a risk factor for any HPV and multiple infections (p = 0.002). The CD4 count >500 cells/mm3 was a protective factor for the HPV16/18 (p = 0.048) and multiple infections (p = 0.023), and the undetectable viral load and HAART treatment were both protective for any HPV (p = 0.010), HR-HPV (p = 0.091) and multiple infections (p = 0.006). Abnormal anoscopy was found in 23.7% (53/223) of the total number of patients, and this was significantly associated with all types of investigated HPV infections (p<0.0001). Conclusions In this study, anal HPV infection was common among young HIV-positive men and women, particularly in MSM. Anal cancer screening in patients at risk, such as those who are HIV-positive, and mainly those with anal HPV infection and a history of STI, will increase the likelihood of detecting anal intraepithelial neoplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2878136221,"Astronauts and cancer patients receive different types of radiation, and radiation decreases bone strength and leads to radiation-induced osteoporosis. This effect is attributed to the activation of osteoclasts. Our aim was to study the effect of Sema3a on the differentiation of the murine macrophage cell line Raw264.7 into osteoclasts upon irradiation. Raw264.7 cells were divided into four groups: A, receiving no radiation; B, receiving no radiation + 50ngng/ml Sema3a; C, receiving 2Gy radiation; and D, receiving 2Gy radiation +50ngng/ml Sema3a. After treatment, cells were subjected to a proliferation assay, migration assay, live and apoptosis assay, and an ROS assay, along with analyses of bone resorption activity, TRAP staining and RT-PCR to assess the effect of Sema3a on Raw264.7 cells under 2Gy radiation. Sema3a inhibited the proliferation of Raw264.7 cells and showed statistical significance at a concentration of 100ngng/ml (P<0.05). Under 2Gy radiation, cell migration was reduced (P<0.05). In addition, 2Gy radiation resulted in more apoptotic cells, a higher level of ROS, larger bone resorption lacunae and more Trap-positive cells (p<0.05), and radiation increased CSTK, NFAT, TRAP-5b, Rankl/OPG, IL-1, IL-6, TNFa and P53 gene expression (P<0.05). Sema3a had an inhibitory effect on the differentiation of Raw264.7 cells and the migration and activity of osteoclasts upon irradiation but did not affect ROS. Sema3a also decreased the expression of CSTK, NFAT, TRAP-5b, Rankl/OPG, IL-1, IL-6 and TNFa on the 3rd and 7th days after irradiation (p<0.05), whereas P53 expression was increased (P<0.05). Sema3a reduced the inflammation induced by radiation and negatively regulated osteoclast differentiation. Sema3a promoted Raw264.7 cell apoptosis after irradiation, indicating that Sema3a could be a potential therapeutic target for radiation-induced osteoporosis."

The roots, stems and leaves can be used as natural medicine, in which indigo and indirubin are two main active ingredients. In this study, quantification of indigo, indirubin, indican and adenosine among various tissues of B. cusia was conducted using HPLC-DAD. Leaves have significantly higher contents than stems and roots (380.66, 315.15, 20,978.26, 4323.15 μg/g in leaves, 306.36, 71.71, 3,056.78, 139.45 μg/g in stems, and 9.31, 7.82, 170.45, 197.48 μg/g in roots, respectively). De novo transcriptome sequencing of B. cusia was performed for the first time. The sequencing yielded 137,216,248, 122,837,394 and 140,240,688 clean reads from leaves, stems and roots respectively, which were assembled into 51,381 unique sequences. A total of 33,317 unigenes could be annotated using the databases of Nr, Swiss-Prot, KEGG and KOG. These analyses provided a detailed view of the enzymes involved in indican backbone biosynthesis, such as cytochrome P450, UDP-glycosyltransferase, glucosidase and tryptophan synthase. Analysis results showed that tryptophan synthase was the candidate gene involved in the tissue-specific biosynthesis of indican. We also detected sixteen types of simple sequence repeats in RNA-Seq data for use in future molecular mark assisted breeding studies. The results will be helpful in further analysis of B. cusia functional genomics, especially in increasing biosynthesis of indican through biotechnological approaches and metabolic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2820666882,"Background South Africa has one of the highest rates of HIV-1 (HIV) infection world-wide, with the highest rates among young women. We analyzed the molecular epidemiology and evolutionary history of HIV in young women attending high school in rural South Africa. Methods Samples were obtained from the HPTN 068 randomized controlled trial, which evaluated the effect of cash transfers for school attendance on HIV incidence in women aged 13–20 years (Mpumalanga province, 2011–2015). Plasma samples from HIV-infected participants were analyzed using the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping assay. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using 200 pol gene study sequences and 2,294 subtype C reference sequences from South Africa. Transmission clusters were identified using Cluster Picker and HIV-TRACE, and were characterized using demographic and other epidemiological data. Phylodynamic analyses were performed using the BEAST software. Results The study enrolled 2,533 young women who were followed through their expected high school graduation date (main study); some participants had a post-study assessment (follow-up study). Two-hundred-twelve of 2,533 enrolled young women had HIV infection. HIV pol sequences were obtained for 94% (n = 201/212) of the HIV-infected participants. All but one of the sequences were HIV-1 subtype C; the non-C subtype sequence was excluded from further analysis. Median pairwise genetic distance between the subtype C sequences was 6.4% (IQR: 5.6–7.2). Overall, 26% of study sequences fell into 21 phylogenetic clusters with 2–6 women per cluster. Thirteen (62%) clusters included women who were HIV-infected at enrollment. Clustering was not associated with study arm, demographic or other epidemiological factors. The estimated date of origin of HIV subtype C in the study population was 1958 (95% highest posterior density [HPD]: 1931–1980), and the median estimated substitution rate among study pol sequences was 1.98x10-3 (95% HPD: 1.15x10-3–2.81x10-3) per site per year. Conclusions Phylogenetic analysis suggests that multiple HIV subtype C sublineages circulate among school age girls in South Africa. There were no substantive differences in the molecular epidemiology of HIV between control and intervention arms in the HPTN 068 trial."
https://openalex.org/W2820951822,"The relationships between nutrition, metabolic response, early growth and later body weight have been investigated in human studies. The aim of this follow-up study was to assess the long-term effect of infant feeding on growth and to study whether the infant metabolome at the age of 4 months might predict anthropometry at 4 years of age. The Belgrade-Munich infant milk trial (BeMIM) was a randomized controlled trial in which healthy term infants received either a protein-reduced infant formula (1.89 g protein/100 kcal) containing alpha-lactalbumin enriched whey and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), or a standard formula (2.2 g protein/100 kcal) without LC-PUFA, focusing on safety and suitability. Non-randomized breastfed infants were used as a reference group. Of the 259 infants that completed the BeMIM study at the age of 4 months (anthropometry assessment and blood sampling), 187 children participated in a follow-up visit at 4 years of age. Anthropometry including weight, standing height, head circumference, and percent body fat was determined using skinfolds (triceps, subscapular) and bioelectrical impedance analysis. Plasma metabolite concentration, collected in samples at the age of 4 months, was measured using flow-injection tandem mass spectrometry. A linear regression model was applied to estimate the associations between each metabolite and growth with metabolites as an independent variable. At 4 years of age, there were no significant group differences in anthropometry and body composition between formula groups. Six metabolites (Asn, Lys, Met, Phe, Trp, Tyr) measured at 4 months of age were significantly associated with changes in weight-for-age z-score between 1 to 4 months of age and BMI-for-age z-score (Tyr only), after adjustment for feeding group. No correlation was found between measured metabolites and long-term growth (up to 4 years of age). No long-term effects of early growth patterns were shown on anthropometry at 4 years of age. The composition of infant formula influences the metabolic profile and early growth, while long-term programming effects were not observed in this study."

We previously showed hearing loss in young people who live in areas of As-polluted drinking water and in young mice orally treated with As. In this study, we epidemiologically examined associations between As levels in toenails and hearing in 145 Bangladeshi aged 12-55 years in 2014. Levels of As in toenails, but not those in urine, were shown to be significantly correlated with hearing loss at 4 kHz [odds ratio (OR) = 4.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.51, 12.05], 8 kHz (OR = 3.91; 95% CI: 1.47, 10.38) and 12 kHz (OR = 4.15; 95% CI: 1.55, 11.09) by multivariate analysis with adjustments for age, sex, smoking and BMI. Our experimental study further showed a significant association between As levels in inner ears and nails (r = 0.8113, p = 0.0014) in mice orally exposed to As, suggesting that As level in nails is a suitable index to assess As level in inner ears. Taken together, the results of our study suggest that As level in nails could be a convenient and non-invasive biomarker for As-mediated hearing loss in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2864379737,"Introduction As there is an increasing number of multicentre lung imaging studies with MRI in patients, dedicated reference phantoms are required to allow for the assessment and comparison of image quality in multi-vendor and multi-centre environments. However, appropriate phantoms for this purpose are so far not available commercially. It was therefore the purpose of this project to design and apply a cost-effective and simple to use reference phantom which addresses the specific requirements for imaging the lungs with MRI. Methods The phantom was designed to simulate 4 compartments (lung, blood, muscle and fat) which reflect the specific conditions in proton-MRI of the chest. Multiple phantom instances were produced and measured at 15 sites using a contemporary proton-MRI protocol designed for an in vivo COPD study at intervals over the course of the study. Measures of signal- and contrast-to-noise ratio, as well as structure and edge depiction were extracted from conventionally acquired images using software written for this purpose. Results For the signal to noise ratio, low intra-scanner variability was found with 4.5% in the lung compartment, 4.0% for blood, 3.3% for muscle and 3.7% for fat. The inter-scanner variability was substantially higher, with 41%, 32%, 27% and 32% for the same order of compartments. In addition, measures of structure and edge depiction were found to both vary significantly among several scanner types and among scanners of the same model which were equipped with different gradient systems. Conclusion The described reference phantom reproducibly quantified image quality aspects and detected substantial inter-scanner variability in a typical pulmonary multicentre proton MRI study, while variability was greater in lung tissue compared to other tissue types. Accordingly, appropriate reference phantoms can help to detect bias in multicentre in vivo study results and could also be used to harmonize equipment or data."
https://openalex.org/W2836914268,"The highly potent botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) inhibits neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions resulting in flaccid muscle paralysis, respiratory arrest and death. In order to reach their neuronal cell targets, BoNT/A must cross epithelial cell barriers lining the intestines and airways. The toxin is produced as a large protein complex comprised of the neurotoxin and non-toxic neurotoxin-associated proteins (NAPs). Although NAPs are known to protect the toxin from harsh environments, their role in the movement of BoNT/A across epithelial barriers has not been fully characterized. In the current study, movement of the toxin across epithelial cells was examined macroscopically using a sensitive near infrared fluorescence transcytosis assay and microscopically using fluorescently labeled toxin and confocal microscopy. The studies show that the BoNT/A complex internalizes more rapidly than the pure toxin. The studies also show that one NAP protein, hemaglutinin 33 (Hn33), enhanced both the binding and movement of a deactivated recombinant botulinum neurotoxin A (DrBoNT) across epithelial cell monolayers and that the toxin associates with Hn33 on the cell surface. Collectively, the data demonstrate that, in addition to their protective role, NAPs and Hn33 play an important role in BoNT/A intoxication."
https://openalex.org/W2839701134,"This study aims to compare the latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) screening strategy of interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA)-alone and in combination with tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) before the initiation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor treatment in patients with inflammatory arthritis. Between January 2011 and June 2017, we enrolled 476 patients who were followed up for ≥1 year after the TNF inhibitor initiation in a tertiary referral center in South Korea. Inflammatory arthritis comprised rheumatoid arthritis in 266 (55.9%) and ankylosing spondylitis in 210 (44.1%) patients. The following strategies were used for LTBI screening during the study period: (i) from January 2011 to October 2014, the combination of TST and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT); (ii) between November 2014 and February 2015, QFT-GIT-alone and (iii) since March 2015, either the combination of TST and QFT-GIT or QFT-GIT-alone depending on the attending physician's choice. We compared the screening strategies of QFT-GIT alone and in combination with TST. Overall, 338 (71.0%) patients received LTBI screening tests using the combination of TST and QFT-GIT, and 138 (29.0%) received QFT-GIT-alone. In addition, the LTBI tests were positive in 159 (47.0%) of 338 patients using the combination tests, and 43.8% (148/338) required LTBI treatment. Meanwhile, the LTBI tests were positive in 32.6% (45/138) of QFT-GIT-alone patients, and 30.4% (42/138) required LTBI treatment. Among 338 patients who received combination tests, 2 patients developed active tuberculosis within 1 year after the TNF inhibitor initiation. Of patients who received QFT-GIT-alone, no patient developed tuberculosis. In conclusion, among patients who received QFT-GIT-alone, the number of patients who required LTBI treatment declined compared to the TST and QFT-GIT combination, and none developed active tuberculosis within 1 year, suggesting that QFT-GIT-alone could be a potential screening strategy for diagnosing LTBI in patients with inflammatory arthritis in South Korea."
https://openalex.org/W2832627245,"Background Hospitals are vulnerable to fires and the evacuation process is challenging. However, face-to-face fire prevention and evacuation training may take healthcare workers’ time away from patient care; therefore, effective on-line training may be warranted. We carried out and examined the effectiveness of an on-line education and training of fire prevention and evacuation training for healthcare workers in China by a randomized controlled trial using convenience sampling from five public hospitals in China. Methods A total of 128 participants were recruited between December 2014 and March 2015. The authors built a webpage that included the informed consent statement, pre-test questionnaire, video training, and post-test questionnaire. After completing the pre-test questionnaire, participants were randomly assigned to watch the intervention video (basic response to a hospital fire) or the control video (introduction to volcanic disasters). A 45-item questionnaire on knowledge of fire prevention and evacuation was administered before and after the video watching. This questionnaire were further divided into two subscales (25-item generic knowledge of fire response and 20-item hospital-specific knowledge of fire prevention and evacuation). One point was awarded for each correct answer. Results Half of the participants (n = 64, 50%) were randomized into the intervention group and the remaining 64 (50%) were randomized into the control group. For generic knowledge of fire prevention and evacuation, those in the intervention group improved significantly (from 16.16 to 20.44, P < 0.001) while the scores of those in the control group decreased significantly (from 15.27 to 13.70, P = 0.03). For hospital-specific knowledge of fire prevention and evacuation, those in the intervention group (from 10.75 to 11.33, P = 0.15) and the control group (from 10.38 to 10.16, P = 0.54) had insignificant change. For total score, those in the intervention group improved significantly (from 26.91 to 31.77, P < 0.001) while those in the control group decreased insignificantly (from 25.64 to 23.86, P = 0.07). After the intervention, the difference between the scores of the intervention group and the control group on all three knowledge areas of fire prevention and evacuation (generic, hospital-specific, and total) were significant (all Ps < 0.05). Conclusions An on-line fire training program delivered via educational video can effectively improve healthcare workers’ knowledge of fire prevention and evacuation.

https://openalex.org/W2853456690,"Estimates of animal diets and trophic structure using stable isotope analysis are strongly affected by diet-tissue discrimination and tissue turnover rates, yet these factors are often unknown for consumers because they must be measured using controlled-feeding studies. Furthermore, these parameters may be influenced by diet quality, growth, and other factors. We measured the effect of dietary protein content on diet-tissue discrimination and tissue turnover in three freshwater snail species. We fed lettuce to individually housed snails (n = 450 per species) for ten weeks, then half were switched to a high-protein diet. Isotopic values of muscle and gonad tissue were assessed at 48 and 80 days post-diet change. Snail discrimination factors varied by diet (low-protein > high-protein) and usually differed among species for both N and C, although species had similar carbon discrimination when fed the low-protein diet. Carbon turnover rates were similar among species for a given tissue type, but nitrogen turnover varied more among species. In addition, diet affected growth of species differently; some species grew larger on high-protein (H. trivolvis) while others grew larger on low-protein diet (Lymnaea spp.). These differences among species in growth influenced turnover rates, which were faster in the species with the highest growth rate following the diet switch from low to high-protein. Thus, growth is one of the main processes that affects tissue turnover, but growth and feeding preference did not affect diet-tissue discrimination, which was greater on low-protein than high-protein diets for all species regardless of growth performance. These results suggest that diet might influence two key parameters of stable isotope analysis differently."
https://openalex.org/W2874701303,"Background/Aims The seroclearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) is regarded as a functional cure of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) although it occurs rarely. Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) revealed various genetic alterations related to the clinical course of HBV infection. However, all of these studies focused on the progression of HBV infection to chronicity and had limited application because of the heterogeneity of HBV genotypes. In the present study, we aimed to determine susceptibility genetic markers for seroclearance of HBsAg in CHB patients with a homogenous viral genotype. Methods One hundred patients with CHB who had experienced HBsAg seroclearance before 60 years of age and another 100 with CHB showing high serum levels of HBsAg even after 60 years of age were enrolled. Extreme-phenotype GWAS was conducted using blood samples of participants. Results We identified three single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs7944135 (P = 4.17 × 10−6, odds ratio [OR] = 4.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.27–7.63) at 11q12.1, rs171941 (P = 3.52×10−6, OR = 3.69, 95% CI = 2.13–6.42) at 5q14.1, and rs6462008 (P = 3.40×10−6, OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.22–0.54) at 7p15.2 as novel susceptibility loci associated with HBsAg seroclearance in patients with CHB. The flanking genes at these loci including MPEG1, DTX4, MTX3, and HOXA13 were suggested to have functional significance. In addition, through functional analysis, CXCL13 was also presumed to be related. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first GWAS regarding the seroclearance of HBsAg in CHB patients. We identify new susceptibility loci for cure of CHB, providing new insights into its pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2815928017,"Purpose This retrospective cross-sectional study aimed to identify opportunities for improvement in food and nutrition research by examining risk of bias (ROB) domains. Methods Ratings were extracted from critical appraisal records for 5675 studies used in systematic reviews conducted by three organizations. Variables were as follows: ROB domains defined by the Cochrane Collaboration (Selection, Performance, Detection, Attrition, and Reporting), publication year, research type (intervention or observation) and specific design, funder, and overall quality rating (positive, neutral, or negative). Appraisal instrument questions were mapped to ROB domains. The kappa statistic was used to determine consistency when multiple ROB ratings were available. Binary logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression were used to predict overall quality and ROB domains. Findings Studies represented a wide variety of research topics (clinical nutrition, food safety, dietary patterns, and dietary supplements) among 15 different research designs with a balance of intervention (49%) and observation (51%) types, published between 1930 and 2015 (64% between 2000–2009). Duplicate ratings (10%) were consistent (κ = 0.86–0.94). Selection and Performance domain criteria were least likely to be met (57.9% to 60.1%). Selection, Detection, and Performance ROB ratings predicted neutral or negative quality compared to positive quality (p<0.001). Funder, year, and research design were significant predictors of ROB. Some sources of funding predicted increased ROB (p<0.001) for Selection (interventional: industry only and none/not reported; observational: other only and none/not reported) and Reporting (observational: university only and other only). Reduced ROB was predicted by combined and other-only funding for intervention research (p<0.005). Performance ROB domain ratings started significantly improving in 2000; others improved after 1990 (p<0.001). Research designs with higher ROB were nonrandomized intervention and time series designs compared to RCT and prospective cohort designs respectively (p<0.001). Conclusions Opportunities for improvement in food and nutrition research are in the Selection, Performance, and Detection ROB domains."
https://openalex.org/W2840496433,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and degrees of severity. Few genomic biomarkers for SLE have been validated and employed to inform clinical classifications and decisions. To discover and assess the gene-expression based SLE predictors in published studies, we performed a meta-analysis using our established signature database and a data similarity-driven strategy. From 13 training data sets on SLE gene-expression studies, we identified a SLE meta-signature (SLEmetaSig100) containing 100 concordant genes that are involved in DNA sensors and the IFN signaling pathway. We rigorously examined SLEmetaSig100 with both retrospective and prospective validation in two independent data sets. Using unsupervised clustering, we retrospectively elucidated that SLEmetaSig100 could classify clinical samples into two groups that correlated with SLE disease status and disease activities. More importantly, SLEmetaSig100 enabled personalized stratification demonstrating its ability to prospectively predict SLE disease at the individual patient level. To evaluate the performance of SLEmetaSig100 in predicting SLE, we predicted 1,171 testing samples to be either non-SLE or SLE with positive predictive value (97-99%), specificity (85%-84%), and sensitivity (60-84%). Our study suggests that SLEmetaSig100 has enhanced predictive value to facilitate current SLE clinical classification and provides personalized disease activity monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2846285720,"The role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in health research has attracted growing attention. NGOs are important service providers and advocates in international health, and conducting research can help NGOs to strengthen these service delivery and advocacy activities. However, capacity to conduct research varies among NGOs. There is currently limited evidence on NGOs' research capacity that can explain why capacity varies or indicate potential areas for support. We examined NGOs' capacity to conduct research, identifying factors that affect their access to the funds, time and skills needed to undertake research.We examined research capacity through qualitative case studies of three NGOs in Malawi, including one national and two international NGOs. Data were generated through interviews and focus groups with NGO staff, observation of NGO activities, and document reviews.Availability of funding, skills and time to conduct research varies considerably between the case NGOs. Access to these resources is affected by internal processes such as sources of funding and prioritisation of research, and by the wider environment and external relationships, including the nature of donor support. Constraints include limited ability to apply for research funding, a perception that donors will not support research costs, lack of funding to hire or train research staff, and prioritisation of service delivery over research in funding proposals and staff schedules.The findings suggest strategies for NGOs and for donors interested in supporting NGOs' research capacity. Above all, the findings reinforce the importance of initial capacity assessments to identify organisational needs and opportunities. In addition, the need for time and funding as well as skills suggests that strengthening NGOs' research capacity will often require more than research training."
https://openalex.org/W2821497425,"The human Adeno-Associated Virus serotype 2 (wtAAV2) is a common non-pathological virus and its recombinant form (rAAV) is widely used as gene therapy vector. Although rAAVs are routinely produced in the Baculovirus/Sf9 cell system, wtAAV2 has never been studied in this context. We tried to produce wtAAV2 in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system hypothesizing that the wtAAV2 may be considered as a normal recombinant AAV transgene. Through our attempts to produce wtAAV2 in Baculovirus/Sf9, we found that wtAAV2 p5 promoter, which controls the expression of large Rep proteins in mammalian cells, was active in this system. p5 promoter activity in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system leads to the expression of Rep78 that finally excises wtAAV2 genome from the baculovirus genome during the earliest phases of baculovirus stock production. Via p5 promoter expression kinetics and strand specific RNA-Seq analysis of wtAAV2, rAAV and Rep2/Cap2 cassettes in the baculovirus context we could demonstrate that wtAAV2 native promoters, p5, p19 and p40 are all active in the context of the baculovirus system and lead to the expression of different proteins and peptides. In addition, this study has proven that the baculovirus brings at least some of the helper functions needed in the AAV replication/life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2873870267,"Though citizen science programs have been broadly successful in diverse scientific fields, their adoption has lagged in some disciplines, including soil science and ecosystem ecology. Collaborations with citizen scientists may be viewed as a conundrum in these disciplines, which often require substantial labor and technical experience; citizen scientists could improve sampling capacity but may reduce sample quality or require training and oversight prior to and while performing specialized tasks. To demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating citizen scientists into soil biogeochemistry research, we conducted a proof-of-concept study in high-elevation meadows of the Sierra Nevada in California. A collaboration between university researchers and citizen scientists allowed us to assess spatial and diel patterns of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes with an intensity and frequency that would otherwise be beyond the capacity of a typical research laboratory. This collaboration with citizen scientists increased our sampling intensity by over 700% while only doubling the sampling error relative to that of full-time researchers. With training and support from project scientists, citizen scientists collected data that demonstrate spatial independence of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide at scales between 1 m and 175 m. Additionally, we found a lack of temporal variation over a 24-h period for all three GHGs. Citizen scientists participating in this one-day event reported levels of satisfaction commensurate with longer-term, immersive campaigns. The place-based event also proved an effective tool for teaching intangible concepts of soil biogeochemistry and promoting local conservation. Despite perceived barriers to entry, this study demonstrates the mutual benefits of citizen science collaborations in soil science and ecosystem ecology, encouraging adoption by disciplines that have been slow to take advantage of such collaborations. Short-term, local citizen science events can provide meaningful experiences for area residents and teach global biogeochemical cycles in a place-based context."
https://openalex.org/W2851420893,"Pathway analysis is a common approach in diverse biomedical studies, yet the currently-available pathway tools do not typically support the increasingly popular personalized analyses. Another weakness of the currently-available pathway methods is their inability to handle challenging data with only modest group-based effects compared to natural individual variation. In an effort to address these issues, this study presents a novel pathway method PASI (Pathway Analysis for Sample-level Information) and demonstrates its performance on complex diseases with different levels of group-based differences in gene expression. PASI is freely available as an R package."
https://openalex.org/W2836079617,"Probabilistic formalism of quantum mechanics is used to quantitatively link the global scale mass potential with the underlying electrical activity of excitable cells. Previous approaches implemented methods of classical physics to reconstruct the mass potential in terms of explicit physical models of participating cells and the volume conductor. However, the multiplicity of cellular processes with extremely intricate mixtures of deterministic and random factors prevents the creation of consistent biophysical parameter sets. To avoid the uncertainty inherent in physical attributes of cell ensembles, we undertake here a radical departure from deterministic equations of classical physics, instead applying the probabilistic reasoning of quantum mechanics. Crucial steps include: (1) the relocation of the elementary bioelectric sources from a cellular to a molecular level; (2) the creation of microscale particle models in terms of a non-homogenous birth-and-death process. To link the microscale processes with macroscale potentials, time-frequency analysis was applied for estimation of the empirical characteristic functions for component waveforms of electroencephalogram (EEG), eye-blink electromyogram (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). We describe universal models for the amplitude spectra and phase functions of functional components of mass potentials. The corresponding time domain relationships disclose the dynamics of mass potential components as limit distribution functions produced by specific microscale transients. The probabilistic laws governing the microscale machinery, founded on an empirical basis, are presented. Computer simulations of particle populations with time dependent transition probabilities reveal that hidden deterministic chaos underlies development of the components of mass potentials. We label this kind of behaviour “transient deterministic chaos”."
https://openalex.org/W2839299106,"In genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for binary traits (or case-control samples) in the presence of covariates to be adjusted for, researchers often use a logistic regression model to test variants for disease association. Popular tests include Wald, likelihood ratio, and score tests. For likelihood ratio test and Wald test, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which requires iterative procedure, must be computed for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). In contrast, the score test only requires MLE under the null model, being lower in computational cost than other tests. Usually, genotype data include missing genotypes because of assay failures. It loses computational efficiency in the conventional score test (CST), which requires null estimation by excluding individuals with missing genotype for each SNP. In this study, we propose two new score tests, called PM1 and PM2, that use a single global null estimator for all SNPs regardless of missing genotypes, thereby enabling faster computation than CST. We prove that PM2 and CST have an equivalent asymptotic power and that the power of PM1 is asymptotically lower than that of PM2. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods in terms of type I error rates and power by simulation studies and application to real GWAS data provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), confirming our theoretical results. ADNI-GWAS application demonstrated that the proposed score tests improve computational speed about 6-18 times faster than the existing tests, CST, Wald tests and likelihood ratio tests. Our score tests are general and applicable to other regression models."
https://openalex.org/W2869414816,"Leptin has shown positive effects on respiratory function in experimental settings. The role of leptin on perioperative respiratory function in morbidly obese patients has not been established. We performed a retrospective analysis of morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Fasting serum leptin and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured preoperatively, and arterial blood gases were obtained pre- and postoperatively. Outcome variables were arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and differences in PaO2 and PaCO2 between pre- and postoperative values (ΔPaO2, ΔPaCO2; postoperative minus preoperative). Patients with lower (<40 μg/L) and higher (≥40 μg/L) leptin levels were compared. Bravais-Pearson’s correlation, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression analysis were performed. A total of 112 morbidly obese patients were included. Serum leptin was significantly higher in females than in males (42.86±12.89 vs. 30.67±13.39 μg/L, p<0.0001). Leptin was positively correlated with body mass index (r = 0.238; p = 0.011), IL-6 (r = 0.473; p<0.0001), and ΔPaO2 (r = 0.312; p = 0.0008). Leptin was negatively correlated with preoperative PaO2 (r = -0.199; p = 0.035). Preoperative PaO2 was lower, ΔPaCO2 was smaller, and ΔPaO2 was greater in the high leptin group than in the low leptin group. In multiple regression analysis, leptin was negatively associated with preoperative PaO2 (estimate coefficient = -0.147; p = 0.023). In logistic regression analysis, leptin was associated with improved ΔPaO2 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.104; p = 0.0138) and ΔPaCO2 (OR = 0.968; p = 0.0334). Leptin appears to have dual effects related to perioperative gas exchange in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. It is associated with worse preoperative oxygenation but improved respiratory function after surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2867951924,"In this paper, we describe SAFlex (Structural Alphabet Flexibility), an extension of an existing structural alphabet (HMM-SA), to better explore increasing protein three dimensional structure information by encoding conformations of proteins in case of missing residues or uncertainties. An SA aims to reduce three dimensional conformations of proteins as well as their analysis and comparison complexity by simplifying any conformation in a series of structural letters. Our methodology presents several novelties. Firstly, it can account for the encoding uncertainty by providing a wide range of encoding options: the maximum a posteriori, the marginal posterior distribution, and the effective number of letters at each given position. Secondly, our new algorithm deals with the missing data in the protein structure files (concerning more than 75% of the proteins from the Protein Data Bank) in a rigorous probabilistic framework. Thirdly, SAFlex is able to encode and to build a consensus encoding from different replicates of a single protein such as several homomer chains. This allows localizing structural differences between different chains and detecting structural variability, which is essential for protein flexibility identification. These improvements are illustrated on different proteins, such as the crystal structure of an eukaryotic small heat shock protein. They are promising to explore increasing protein redundancy data and obtain useful quantification of their flexibility."
