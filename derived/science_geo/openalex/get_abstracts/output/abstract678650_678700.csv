https://openalex.org/W3185213122,"SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause severe respiratory COVID-19. However, many individuals present with isolated upper respiratory symptoms, suggesting potential to constrain viral pathology to the nasopharynx. Which cells SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets and how infection influences the respiratory epithelium remains incompletely understood. We performed scRNA-seq on nasopharyngeal swabs from 58 healthy and COVID-19 participants. During COVID-19, we observe expansion of secretory, loss of ciliated, and epithelial cell repopulation via deuterosomal cell expansion. In mild and moderate COVID-19, epithelial cells express anti-viral/interferon-responsive genes, while cells in severe COVID-19 have muted anti-viral responses despite equivalent viral loads. SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ host-target cells are highly heterogenous, including developing ciliated, interferon-responsive ciliated, AZGP1high goblet, and KRT13+ ""hillock""-like cells, and we identify genes associated with susceptibility, resistance, or infection response. Our study defines protective and detrimental responses to SARS-CoV-2, the direct viral targets of infection, and suggests that failed nasal epithelial anti-viral immunity may underlie and precede severe COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3187624094,"The brain’s endocannabinoid system is a powerful controller of neurotransmitter release, shaping synaptic communication under physiological and pathological conditions. However, our understanding of endocannabinoid signaling in vivo is limited by the inability to measure their changes at timescales commensurate with the high lability of lipid signals, leaving fundamental questions of whether, how, and which endocannabinoids fluctuate with neural activity unresolved. Using novel imaging approaches in awake behaving mice, we now demonstrate that the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, not anandamide, is dynamically coupled to hippocampal neural activity with high spatiotemporal specificity. Furthermore, we show that seizures amplify the physiological endocannabinoid increase by orders of magnitude and drive the downstream synthesis of vasoactive prostaglandins that culminate in a prolonged stroke-like event. These results shed new light on normal and pathological endocannabinoid signaling in vivo."

We argue that, for neuroscience research, until viable and translational alternatives become available and the value of these alternatives has been proven, the use of animals should not be compromised."
https://openalex.org/W3189646258,"Road crash fatality is a universal problem of the transportation system. A massive death toll caused annually due to road crash incidents, and among them, vulnerable road users (VRU) are endangered with high crash severity. This paper focuses on employing machine learning-based classification approaches for modelling injury severity of vulnerable road users—pedestrian, bicyclist, and motorcyclist. Specifically, this study aims to analyse critical features associated with different VRU groups—for pedestrian, bicyclist, motorcyclist and all VRU groups together. The critical factor of crash severity outcomes for these VRU groups is estimated in identifying the similarities and differences across different important features associated with different VRU groups. The crash data for the study is sourced from the state of Queensland in Australia for the years 2013 through 2019. The supervised machine learning algorithms considered for the empirical analysis includes the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). In these models, 17 distinct road crash parameters are considered as input features to train models, which originate from road user characteristics, weather and environment, vehicle and driver condition, period, road characteristics and regions, traffic, and speed jurisdiction. These classification models are separately trained and tested for individual and unified VRU to assess crash severity levels. Afterwards, model performances are compared with each other to justify the best classifier where Random Forest classification models for all VRU modes are found to be comparatively robust in test accuracy: (motorcyclist: 72.30%, bicyclist: 64.45%, pedestrian: 67.23%, unified VRU: 68.57%). Based on the Random Forest model, the road crash features are ranked and compared according to their impact on crash severity classification. Furthermore, a model-based partial dependency of each road crash parameters on the severity levels is plotted and compared for each individual and unified VRU. This clarifies the tendency of road crash parameters to vary with different VRU crash severity. Based on the outcome of the comparative analysis, motorcyclists are found to be more likely exposed to higher crash severity, followed by pedestrians and bicyclists."
https://openalex.org/W3189284723,"Background The diversity in the clinical course of COVID-19 has been related to differences in innate and adaptative immune response mechanisms. Natural killer (NK) lymphocytes are critical protagonists of human host defense against viral infections. It would seem that reduced circulating levels of these cells have an impact on COVID-19 progression and severity. Their activity is strongly regulated by killer-cell immuno-globulin-like receptors (KIRs) expressed on the NK cell surface. The present study’s focus was to investigate the impact of KIRs and their HLA Class I ligands on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods KIR gene frequencies, KIR haplotypes, KIR ligands and combinations of KIRs and their HLA Class I ligands were investigated in 396 Sardinian patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Comparisons were made between 2 groups of patients divided according to disease severity: 240 patients were symptomatic or paucisymptomatic (Group A), 156 hospitalized patients had severe disease (Group S). The immunogenetic characteristics of patients were also compared to a population group of 400 individuals from the same geographical areas. Results Substantial differences were obtained for KIR genes, KIR haplotypes and KIR - HLA ligand combinations when comparing patients of Group S to those of Group A. Patients in Group S had a statistically significant higher frequency of the KIR A/A haplotype compared to patients in Group A [34.6% vs 23.8%, OR = 1.7 (95% CI 1.1–2.6); P = 0.02, Pc = 0.04]. Moreover, the KIR2DS2 / HLA C1 combination was poorly represented in the group of patients with severe symptoms compared to those of the asymptomatic-paucisymptomatic group [33.3% vs 50.0%, OR = 0.5 (95% CI 0.3–0.8), P = 0.001, Pc = 0.002]. Multivariate analysis confirmed that, regardless of the sex and age of the patients, the latter genetic variable correlated with a less severe disease course [OR M = 0.4 (95% CI 0.3–0.7), P M = 0.0005, P MC = 0.005]. Conclusions The KIR2DS2 / HLA C1 functional unit resulted to have a strong protective effect against the adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Combined to other well known factors such as advanced age, male sex and concomitant autoimmune diseases, this marker could prove to be highly informative of the disease course and thus enable the timely intervention needed to reduce the mortality associated with the severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, larger studies in other populations as well as experimental functional studies will be needed to confirm our findings and further pursue the effect of KIR receptors on NK cell immune-mediated response to SARS-Cov-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3187216514,"Traditional sampling methods for the study of poultry gut microbiota preclude longitudinal studies as they require euthanasia of birds for the collection of caecal and ileal contents. Some recent research has investigated alternative sampling methods to overcome this issue. The main goal of this study was to assess to what extent the microbial composition of non-invasive samples (excreta, litter and poultry dust) are representative of invasive samples (caecal and ileal contents). The microbiota of excreta, dust, litter, caecal and ileal contents (n = 110) was assessed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in caecal contents, 99.7% were also detected in dust, 98.6% in litter and 100% in excreta. Of the OTUs detected in ileal contents, 99.8% were detected in dust, 99.3% in litter and 95.3% in excreta. Although the majority of the OTUs found in invasive samples were detected in non-invasive samples, the relative abundance of members of the microbial communities of these groups were different, as shown by beta diversity measures. Under the conditions of this study, correlation analysis showed that dust could be used as a proxy for ileal and caecal contents to detect the abundance of the phylum Firmicutes, and excreta as a proxy of caecal contents for the detection of Tenericutes. Similarly, litter could be used as a proxy for caecal contents to detect the abundance of Firmicutes and Tenericutes. However, none of the non-invasive samples could be used to infer the overall abundance of OTUs observed in invasive samples. In conclusion, non-invasive samples could be used to detect the presence and absence of the majority of the OTUs found in invasive samples, but could not accurately reflect the microbial community structure of invasive samples."
https://openalex.org/W3192415646,"While HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective, it has arguably disrupted norms of 'safe sex' that for many years were synonymous with condom use. This qualitative study explored the culture of PrEP adoption and evolving concepts of 'safe sex' in Sydney, Australia, during a period of rapidly escalating access from 2015-2018, drawing on interviews with sexually active gay men (n = 31) and interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders (n = 10). Data were analysed thematically. Our results explored the decreasing centrality of condoms in risk reduction and new patterns of sexual negotiation. With regards to stigma, we found that there was arguably more stigma related to not taking PrEP than to taking PrEP in this sample. We also found that participants remained highly engaged with promoting the wellbeing of their communities through activities as seemingly disparate as regular STI testing, promotion of PrEP in their social circles, and contribution to research. This study has important implications for health promotion. It demonstrates how constructing PrEP as a rigid new standard to which gay men 'should' adhere can alienate some men and potentially create community divisions. Instead, we recommend promoting choice from a range of HIV prevention options that have both high efficacy and high acceptability."
https://openalex.org/W3190893860,"India has remarkably the highest number of snakebite cases contributing to nearly 50% of the global snakebite deaths. Despite this fact, there is limited knowledge and awareness regarding the management practices for snakebite in the Indian population. The study aimed to explore the knowledge, awareness, and perception of snakes and snakebites, first aid, and treatment amongst the community and the frontline health workers in a tribal block of Dahanu, Maharashtra, India.A cross-sectional study was carried out from June 2016 to October 2018 in the Dahanu Block, Maharashtra. Perceptions, knowledge, awareness, and first-aid practices on the snakebites among the community were studied through focus group discussions (FGDs). Semi-structured questionnaires were used to assess the knowledge, awareness, and experience of the traditional faith healers, snake rescuers, frontline health workers on the snakebites and their management. A facility check survey was conducted using pre-tested questionnaires for different levels of the government health care facilities.Most of the tribal community was aware of the commonly found snakes and their hiding places. However, there was inadequate knowledge on the identification and classification of venomous snakes. Belief in a snake god, the perception that snakes will not come out during thunderstorms, change in taste sensation, the ability of tamarind seeds or magnet to reduce the venom effect were some of the superstitions reported by the tribal community. The application of a harmful method (Tourniquet) as the first aid for snakebite was practiced by the tribal community. They preferred herbal medicines and visiting the traditional faith healers before shifting the patient to the government health facility. The knowledge on the ability to identify venomous snakebites and anti-venom was significantly higher amongst nurses and accredited social health activists (ASHAs) than auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) and multi-purpose workers (MPWs) (p < 0.05). None of the traditional faith healers; but nearly 60% of snake rescuers were aware of anti-venom. Fifty percent of the medical officers in Dahanu block did not have correct knowledge about the Krait bite symptoms, and renal complications due to the Russell viper bite.Inappropriate perception, inadequate awareness, and knowledge about snakes and snakebites may predispose the tribal community to increased risks of venomous snakebites. Unproven and harmful methods for snakebite treatment practiced by the community and traditional faith healers could be dangerous leading to high mortality. Therefore, a multi-sectoral approach of community awareness, mapping of vulnerable populations, capacity building of health care facility, empowerment of health care workers (HCWs) could be useful for reducing the mortality and morbidity due to snakebite envenoming in India."
https://openalex.org/W3192902141,"Tuberculosis (TB) incidence and corresponding mortality rates in S. Korea are unusual and unique compared to other economically developed countries. Korea has the highest TB incidence rate in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. TB is known as a disease reflecting socio-economic and environmental conditions of a society. Besides, TB is an infectious disease spread through the air, naturally forming spatial dependence of its incidence. This study investigates TB incidences in Korea in socio-economic and environmental perspectives. Eigenvector spatial filtering applied accounts for spatial autocorrelation in the TB incidence, and Getis-Ord [Formula: see text] statistic tracks the changes of TB clusters at given time. The results show that population composition ratio, population growth rate, health insurance payment, and public health variables are significant throughout the study period. Environmental variables make minor effects on TB incidence. This study argues that unique demographic features of Korea are a potential threat to TB control in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3187228760,"The forecasting of lower limb trajectories can improve the operation of assistive devices and minimise the risk of tripping and balance loss. The aim of this work was to examine four Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architectures (Vanilla, Stacked, Bidirectional and Autoencoders) in predicting the future trajectories of lower limb kinematics, i.e. Angular Velocity (AV) and Linear Acceleration (LA). Kinematics data of foot, shank and thigh (LA and AV) were collected from 13 male and 3 female participants (28 ± 4 years old, 1.72 ± 0.07 m in height, 66 ± 10 kg in mass) who walked for 10 minutes at preferred walking speed (4.34 ± 0.43 km.h -1 ) and at an imposed speed (5km.h -1 , 15.4% ± 7.6% faster) on a 0% gradient treadmill. The sliding window technique was adopted for training and testing the LSTM models with total kinematics time-series data of 10,500 strides. Results based on leave-one-out cross validation, suggested that the LSTM autoencoders is the top predictor of the lower limb kinematics trajectories (i.e. up to 0.1s). The normalised mean squared error was evaluated on trajectory predictions at each time-step and it obtained 2.82–5.31% for the LSTM autoencoders. The ability to predict future lower limb motions may have a wide range of applications including the design and control of bionics allowing improved human-machine interface and mitigating the risk of falls and balance loss."
https://openalex.org/W3191387426,"Background Canine urothelial carcinoma is the most common form of canine bladder cancer. Treatment with chemotherapy has variable response rates leading to most dogs succumbing to their disease within a year. Cannabidiol is an emerging treatment within the field of oncology. In reported in vivo studies, cannabidiol has induced apoptosis, reduced cell migration, and acted as a chemotherapy sensitizer in various human tumor types. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of cannabidiol on canine urothelial carcinoma cell viability and apoptosis as both a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in vitro . Results Cannabidiol reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in canine urothelial cells as determined by crystal violet viability assay and annexin V/propidium iodide flow cytometry. Furthermore, combinations of cannabidiol with mitoxantrone and vinblastine chemotherapy yielded significantly reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis compared to single agent treatment alone. The drug interactions were deemed synergistic based on combination index calculations. Conversely, the combination of cannabidiol and carboplatin did not result in decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis compared to single agent treatment. Combination index calculations suggested an antagonistic interaction between these drugs. Finally, the combination of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug piroxicam with cannabidiol did not significantly affect cell viability, although, some cell lines demonstrated decreased cell viability when mitoxantrone was combined with piroxicam. Conclusions Cannabidiol showed promising results as a single agent or in combination with mitoxantrone and vinblastine for treatment of canine urothelial carcinoma cells. Further studies are justified to investigate whether these results are translatable in vivo ."
https://openalex.org/W3193008217,"This study’s main goal was to evaluate the association between anxious temperament and the fear of COVID-19-related self-infection and infection in loved ones (family members, friends, relatives) and cyberchondria. The sample consisted of 499 men and women aged between 18 and 72 who were gathered from the general population via an online recruitment platform. A numerical rating scale comprising 11 degrees of fear was used to assess participants’ COVID-19-related fear, and affective temperaments were evaluated using Akiskal’s Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A) scales. Cyberchondria was assessed using McElroy and Shevlin’s Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS). Small to medium positive correlations were found between depressive, cyclothymic, irritable and anxious temperaments and cyberchondria and between depressive and anxious temperaments and COVID-19 fears. However, no correlation was observed between the hyperthymic temperament and cyberchondria. Cyberchondria positively correlated with both COVID-19 fears scales, though the correlation coefficients were medium. Based on the results of linear regression analysis, only anxious temperament and COVID-19 fear of self-infection were significant predictors of cyberchondria. The analysis also revealed a significant indirect effect of anxious temperament on cyberchondria through fear of COVID-19 self-infection as a mediator between anxious temperament and cyberchondria."
https://openalex.org/W3188948225,"Saliva is an attractive specimen type for asymptomatic surveillance of COVID-19 in large populations due to its ease of collection and its demonstrated utility for detecting RNA from SARS-CoV-2. Multiple saliva-based viral detection protocols use a direct-to-RT-qPCR approach that eliminates nucleic acid extraction but can reduce viral RNA detection sensitivity. To improve test sensitivity while maintaining speed, we developed a robotic nucleic acid extraction method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva samples with high throughput. Using this assay, the Free Asymptomatic Saliva Testing (IGI FAST) research study on the UC Berkeley campus conducted 11,971 tests on supervised self-collected saliva samples and identified rare positive specimens containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA during a time of low infection prevalence. In an attempt to increase testing capacity, we further adapted our robotic extraction assay to process pooled saliva samples. We also benchmarked our assay against nasopharyngeal swab specimens and found saliva methods require further optimization to match this gold standard. Finally, we designed and validated a RT-qPCR test suitable for saliva self-collection. These results establish a robotic extraction-based procedure for rapid PCR-based saliva testing that is suitable for samples from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3188028323,"The size of today's biomedical data sets pushes computer equipment to its limits, even for seemingly standard analysis tasks such as data projection or clustering. Reducing large biomedical data by downsampling is therefore a common early step in data processing, often performed as random uniform class-proportional downsampling. In this report, we hypothesized that this can be optimized to obtain samples that better reflect the entire data set than those obtained using the current standard method.By repeating the random sampling and comparing the distribution of the drawn sample with the distribution of the original data, it was possible to establish a method for obtaining subsets of data that better reflect the entire data set than taking only the first randomly selected subsample, as is the current standard. Experiments on artificial and real biomedical data sets showed that the reconstruction of the remaining data from the original data set from the downsampled data improved significantly. This was observed with both principal component analysis and autoencoding neural networks. The fidelity was dependent on both the number of cases drawn from the original and the number of samples drawn.Optimal distribution-preserving class-proportional downsampling yields data subsets that reflect the structure of the entire data better than those obtained with the standard method. By using distributional similarity as the only selection criterion, the proposed method does not in any way affect the results of a later planned analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3188315645,"No diagnostic or predictive instruments to help with early diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention are available as yet for most neuro-psychiatric disorders. A quantum potential mean and variability score (qpmvs), to identify neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive disorders with high accuracy, based on routine EEG recordings, was developed. Information processing in the brain is assumed to involve integration of neuronal activity in various areas of the brain. Thus, the presumed quantum-like structure allows quantification of connectivity as a function of space and time (locality) as well as of instantaneous quantum-like effects in information space (non-locality). EEG signals reflect the holistic (nonseparable) function of the brain, including the highly ordered hierarchy of the brain, expressed by the quantum potential according to Bohmian mechanics, combined with dendrogram representation of data and p -adic numbers. Participants consisted of 230 participants including 28 with major depression, 42 with schizophrenia, 65 with cognitive impairment, and 95 controls. Routine EEG recordings were used for the calculation of qpmvs based on ultrametric analyses, closely coupled with p -adic numbers and quantum theory. Based on area under the curve, high accuracy was obtained in separating healthy controls from those diagnosed with schizophrenia (p&lt;0.0001), depression (p&lt;0.0001), Alzheimer’s disease (AD; p&lt;0.0001), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; p&lt;0.0001) as well as in differentiating participants with schizophrenia from those with depression (p&lt;0.0001), AD (p&lt;0.0001) or MCI (p&lt;0.0001) and in differentiating people with depression from those with AD (p&lt;0.0001) or MCI (p&lt;0.0001). The novel EEG analytic algorithm (qpmvs) seems to be a useful and sufficiently accurate tool for diagnosis of neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive diseases and may be able to predict disease course and response to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3188429476,"Due to advances in high-performance computing technologies, computer graphics techniques-especially those related to mesh simplification-have been noticeably improved. These techniques, which have a strong impact on many applications, such as geometric modeling and visualization, have been well studied for more than two decades. Recent advances in GPUs have led to significant improvements in terms of speed and interactivity. In this paper, we present a mesh simplification algorithm that benefits from the parallel framework provided by recent GPUs. We customize the halfedge data structure for adaption with the dynamic memory restrictions of CUDA. The proposed algorithm is fully parallelized by employing a lock-free skip priority queue and a set of disjoint regions of the mesh. The proposed technique accelerates the simplification process while preserving the topological properties of the mesh. Some results and comparisons are provided to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W3192877180,"Advanced ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecological tumor, mainly due to late diagnoses and acquired drug resistance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small-non coding RNA acting as tumor suppressor/oncogenes differentially expressed in normal and epithelial ovarian cancer and has been recognized as a new class of tumor early detection biomarkers as they are released in blood fluids since tumor initiation process. Here, we evaluated by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) circulating miRNAs in serum samples from healthy (N = 105) and untreated ovarian cancer patients (stages I to IV) (N = 72), grouped into a discovery/training and clinical validation set with the goal to identify the best classifier allowing the discrimination between earlier ovarian tumors from health controls women. The selection of 45 candidate miRNAs to be evaluated in the discovery set was based on miRNAs represented in ovarian cancer explorative commercial panels. We found six miRNAs showing increased levels in the blood of early or late-stage ovarian cancer groups compared to healthy controls. The serum levels of miR-320b and miR-141-3p were considered independent markers of malignancy in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. These markers were used to train diagnostic classifiers comprising miRNAs (miR-320b and miR-141-3p) and miRNAs combined with well-established ovarian cancer protein markers (miR-320b, miR-141-3p, CA-125 and HE4). The miRNA-based classifier was able to accurately discriminate early-stage ovarian cancer patients from health-controls in an independent sample set (Sensitivity = 80.0%, Specificity = 70.3%, AUC = 0.789). In addition, the integration of the serum proteins in the model markedly improved the performance (Sensitivity = 88.9%, Specificity = 100%, AUC = 1.000). A cross-study validation was carried out using four data series obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), corroborating the performance of the miRNA-based classifier (AUCs ranging from 0.637 to 0.979). The clinical utility of the miRNA model should be validated in a prospective cohort in order to investigate their feasibility as an ovarian cancer early detection tool."
https://openalex.org/W3187550351,"This study aimed to investigate the spatial distribution and patterns of multimorbidity among the elderly in China. Data on the occurrence of 14 chronic diseases were collected for 9710 elderly participants in the 2015 waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Web graph, Apriori algorithm, age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (AAC), and Spatial autocorrelation were used to perform the multimorbidity analysis. The multimorbidity prevalence rate was estimated as 49.64% in the elderly in China. Three major multimorbidity patterns were identified: [Asthma/Chronic lungs diseases]: (Support (S) = 6.17%, Confidence (C) = 63.77%, Lift (L) = 5.15); [Asthma, Arthritis, or rheumatism/ Chronic lungs diseases]: (S = 3.12%, C = 64.03%, L = 5.17); [Dyslipidemia, Hypertension, Arthritis or rheumatism/Heart attack]: (S = 3.96%, C = 51.56, L = 2.69). Results of the AAC analysis showed that the more chronic diseases an elderly has, the lower is the 10-year survival rate (P < 0.001). Global spatial autocorrelation showed a positive spatial correlation distribution for the prevalence of the third multimorbidity pattern in China (P = 0.032). The status of chronic diseases and multimorbidity among the elderly with a spatial correlation is a significant health issue in China."
https://openalex.org/W3191734499,"Background Screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is a programme to reduce alcohol consumption for drinkers with high alcohol consumption levels. Only 2.9% of patients in primary health care (PHC) are screened for their alcohol use in Germany, despite high levels of alcohol consumption and attributable harm. We developed an open-access simulation model to estimate the impact of higher SBIRT delivery rates in German PHC settings on population-level alcohol consumption. Methods and findings A hypothetical population of drinkers and non-drinkers was simulated by sex, age, and educational status for the year 2009 based on survey and sales data. Risky drinking persons receiving BI or RT were sampled from this population based on screening coverage and other parameters. Running the simulation model for a ten-year period, drinking levels and heavy episodic drinking (HED) status were changed based on effect sizes from meta-analyses. In the baseline scenario of 2.9% screening coverage, 2.4% of the adult German population received a subsequent intervention between 2009 and 2018. If every second PHC patient would have been screened for alcohol use, 21% of adult residents in Germany would have received BI or RT by the end of the ten-year simulation period. In this scenario, population-level alcohol consumption would be 11% lower than it was in 2018, without any impact on HED prevalence. Screening coverage rates below 10% were not found to have a measurable effect on drinking levels. Conclusions Large-scale implementation of SBIRT in PHC settings can yield substantial reductions of alcohol consumption in Germany. As high screening coverage rates may only be achievable in the long run, other effective alcohol policies are required to achieve short-term reduction of alcohol use and attributable harm in Germany. There is large potential to apply this open-access simulation model to other settings and for other alcohol interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3190321295,"In the absence of a universally accepted association between smoking and COVID-19 health outcomes, we investigated this relationship in a representative cohort from one of the world's highest tobacco consuming regions. This is the first report from the Middle East and North Africa that tackles specifically the association of smoking and COVID-19 mortality while demonstrating a novel sex-discrepancy in the survival rates among patients.Clinical data for 743 hospitalized COVID-19 patients was retrospectively collected from the leading centre for COVID-19 testing and treatment in Lebanon. Logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age and stratified by sex were used to assess the association between the current cigarette smoking status of patients and COVID-19 outcomes.In addition to the high smoking prevalence among our hospitalized COVID-19 patients (42.3%), enrolled smokers tended to have higher reported ICU admissions (28.3% vs 16.6%, p<0.001), longer length of stay in the hospital (12.0 ± 7.8 vs 10.8 days, p<0.001) and higher death incidences as compared to non-smokers (60.5% vs 39.5%, p<0.001). Smokers had an elevated odds ratio for death (OR = 2.3, p<0.001) and for ICU admission (OR = 2.0, p<0.001) which remained significant in a multivariate regression model. Once adjusted for age and stratified by sex, our data revealed that current smoking status reduces survival rate in male patients ([HR] = 1.9 [95% (CI), 1.029-3.616]; p = 0.041) but it does not affect survival outcomes among hospitalized female patients([HR] = 0.79 [95% CI = 0.374-1.689]; p = 0.551).A high smoking prevalence was detected in our hospitalized COVID-19 cohort combined with worse prognosis and higher mortality rate in smoking patients. Our study was the first to highlight potential sex-specific consequences for smoking on COVID-19 outcomes that might further explain the higher vulnerability to death from this disease among men."

We tested the impact of providing community support, training, and clinical packages of varied intensity on depression screening and management for heavy drinking patients in Latin American primary healthcare.Quasi-experimental study involving 58 primary healthcare units in Colombia, Mexico and Peru randomized to receive: (1) usual care (control); (2) training using a brief clinical package; (3) community support plus training using a brief clinical package; (4) community support plus training using a standard clinical package. Outcomes were proportion of: (1) heavy drinking patients screened for depression; (2) screen-positive patients receiving appropriate support; (3) all consulting patients screened for depression, irrespective of drinking status.550/615 identified heavy drinkers were screened for depression (89.4%). 147/230 patients screening positive for depression received appropriate support (64%). Amongst identified heavy drinkers, adjusting for country, sex, age and provider profession, provision of community support and training had no impact on depression activity rates. Intensity of clinical package also did not affect delivery rates, with comparable performance for brief and standard versions. However, amongst all consulting patients, training providers resulted in significantly higher rates of alcohol measurement and in turn higher depression screening rates; 2.7 times higher compared to those not trained.Training using a brief clinical package increased depression screening rates in Latin American primary healthcare. It is not possible to determine the effectiveness of community support on depression activity rates due to the impact of COVID-19."

To detect prognostic factors of VA at 6 months postoperatively (post-VA), multivariate linear regression was performed with post-VA as the objective variable; ILM peeling, sex, age, preoperative VA (pre-VA), intraocular pressure, axial length, duration of RRD, and cataract surgery served as explanatory variables. Recurrence of RRD and epiretinal membrane formation within 6 months postoperatively were compared between groups of patients with and without ILM peeling, among patients with macula-on and macula-off RRD.The inclusion criteria were met by 523 eyes with a macula-on RRD and 364 eyes with a macula-off RRD. ILM peeling was performed in 85 eyes with a macula-on RRD and 57 eyes with a macula-off RRD. In eyes with a macula-on RRD, ILM peeling did not affect post-VA (p = 0.72). Vitrectomy without cataract surgery and poor pre-VA were significantly associated with poor post-VA (p = 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). In eyes with a macula-off RRD, ILM peeling, long duration of RRD, and poor pre-VA were significantly associated with poor post-VA (p = 0.037, p = 0.007, and p < 0.001, respectively). Recurrence of RRD and epiretinal membrane formation were similar between groups of patients with and without ILM peeling, among patients with macula-on and macula-off RRD. Retina sensitivity was not evaluated by microperimetry.ILM peeling did not affect post-VA in eyes with a macula-on RRD, whereas post-VA was worse in eyes with ILM peeling than in eyes without peeling, among eyes with a macula-off RRD."
https://openalex.org/W3187517500,"Math anxiety (MA) affects students of all age groups. Because of its effects on children’s academic development, the need to recognize its early manifestations has been highlighted. We designed a European-Spanish version of the Scale for Early Mathematics Anxiety (SEMA; Wu et al. (2012)), and assessed its psychometric properties in a sample of children aged 7 to 12 years. The participants (967 typically developing children) were elementary school students recruited from ten schools. Children reported their general and math anxiety levels in an individual session and performed nonverbal IQ and math abilities subtests in a group session. Teachers reported the final math grades. The psychometric indices obtained, and the resulting factor structure revealed that the European-Spanish version of the SEMA developed in this study is a reliable and valid measure to evaluate MA in children from 3 rd to 6 th grade. Moreover, we explored gender differences, that resulted in small effect sizes, which disappeared when controlling for trait anxiety. Differences across grades were found for both global MA and the numerical processing anxiety factor but not for the situational and performance anxiety factor. Finally, MA was negatively associated with students’ math achievement, although the strength of the associations varied with the MA measure selected, the kind of math achievement analyzed, and the school stage considered. Our findings highlight the relevance of MA in elementary school and highlight the need for an early identification of students at risk of suffering MA to palliate the negative consequences of MA in children’s cognitive and academic development."
https://openalex.org/W3187874967,"The present study aims to explore the mammalian diversity of Darjeeling district using camera traps along with questionnaire survey in protected area (PA) and non- protected area (Non-PA). We also attempted to understand the influence of habitat variables on mammalian species richness using the generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). A total of 30 mammal species were recorded of which 21 species were detected through camera trapping with the most abundant records of barking deer ( Muntiacus muntjak ) and least of the elusive Chinese pangolin ( Manis pentadactyla ) and red panda ( Ailurus fulgens ). Additionally, melanistic forms of four mammals were also recorded. The mammalian species richness, their capture rate and naïve occupancy did not differ significantly among the PA and Non-PA. The GLMM revealed that the proportions of oak and bamboo in the forest, percentage canopy cover and camera trap operational days ( w AICc = 0.145, w BIC = 0.603) were significant predictors of species richness in the study. We suggest Non-PA forest of Darjeeling should be given equal conservation importance as to the PA. Landscape based conservation planning will be imperative for achieving long term conservation goals in the study area."
https://openalex.org/W3188072436,"Purpose There is robust research examining the negative impact of racial and socioeconomic implicit bias on healthcare provider clinical decision-making. However, other under-studied important biases are likely to impact clinical care as well. The goal of this study was to explore the presence of bias against people with physical disability among a heterogeneous group of healthcare workers and trainees and to evaluate the effect of implicit association testing and an educational module on this bias. Method The study was composed of a one-hour web-based survey and educational module. The survey included an explicit disability bias assessment, disability Implicit Association Tests (IATs), demographic collection, and pre- and post- module clinical vignettes of prenatal patient scenarios. In addition to providing counseling to hypothetical patients, participants also indicated their personal preferences on genetic testing and termination. The educational module focused on the principles of patient-centered counseling. Results The collected data reflects responses from 335 participants. Within this sample, there were both explicit and implicit biases towards individuals with physical disabilities. Prior to the IAT and educational module, when respondents were tasked with providing genetic testing recommendations, implicit biases and personal preferences for genetic testing and termination influenced respondents’ clinical recommendations. Importantly, having previous professional experience with individuals with disabilities diminished biased clinical recommendations prior to the intervention. In response to the IAT and educational intervention, the effect of implicit bias and personal preferences on clinical recommendations decreased. Conclusions This study demonstrates how bias against a marginalized group exists within the medical community and that personal opinions can impact clinical counseling. Importantly, our findings suggest that there are strategies that can be easily implemented into curricula to address disability bias, including formal educational interventions and the addition of professional experiences into healthcare professional training programs."
https://openalex.org/W3188491491,"Exercise intolerance after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a predictor of worse prognosis, but its causes are complex and poorly studied. This study assessed the determinants of exercise intolerance using combined stress echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET-SE) in patients treated for AMI. We prospectively enrolled patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) ≥40% for more than 4 weeks after the first AMI. Stroke volume, heart rate, and arteriovenous oxygen difference (A-VO2Diff) were assessed during symptom-limited CPET-SE. Patients were divided into four groups according to the percentage of predicted oxygen uptake (VO2) (Group 1, <50%; Group 2, 50-74%; Group 3, 75-99%; and Group 4, ≥100%). Among 81 patients (70% male, mean age 58 ± 11 years, 47% ST-segment elevation AMI) mean peak VO2 was 19.5 ± 5.4 mL/kg/min. A better exercise capacity was related to a higher percent predicted heart rate (Group 2 vs. Group 4, p <0.01), higher peak A-VO2Diff (Group 1 vs. Group 3, p <0.01) but without differences in stroke volume. Peak VO2 and percent predicted VO2 had a significant positive correlation with percent predicted heart rate at peak exercise (r = 0.28, p = 0.01 and r = 0.46, p < 0.001) and peak A-VO2Diff (r = 0.68, p <0.001 and r = 0.36, p = 0.001) but not with peak stroke volume. Exercise capacity in patients treated for AMI with LV EF ≥40% is related to heart rate response during exercise and peak peripheral oxygen extraction. CPET-SE enables non-invasive assessment of the mechanisms of exercise intolerance."

Participants were selected by simple random sampling. Data collected through a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire were cleaned and entered into Epi-data 3.1 and exported to SPSS 20 for statistical analysis. Descriptive analysis was done. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were done to measure the strength of association between independent and dependent variables using the odds ratio and 95% of confidence interval. A p-value <0.05 was taken as statistically significant.The overall adherence level to option B+ was 224 (88.2%). Respondents in age group of ≤ 25 [AOR = 0.12, 95% CI (0.03, 0.42)], with no formal education [AOR = 0.12, 95% CI (0.03, 0.51)], experienced drug side effects [AOR = 0.11, 95% CI (0.04, 0.32)], have good knowledge of PMTCT [AOR = 3.6, 95% CI (1.16, 11.3)], and get support from partner/family [AOR = 4.5, 95% CI (1.62, 12.4)] were identified associated factors with adherence level.The level of adherence to option B plus PMTCT was 88.2% which is suboptimal. Ages, educational level, knowledge on PMTCT, getting support from partner/family, and drug side effect were significantly associated with adherence. Therefore, educating and counseling on the service of PMTCT to improve their knowledge and encouraging partner/family involvement in care are mandatory to achieve the standard adherence level."

They are associated with poor drug adherence, treatment failure, and increase the risk for suicide. There was limited evidence of depressive symptoms among HIV-positive patients in the study area. So, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and associated factors among HIV-positive patients attending public health facilities of Dessie town, North-central Ethiopia, 2019.A cross-sectional study was conducted on 380 HIV-positive patients attending ART clinics in Dessie town, North-central Ethiopia, 2019. Samples were selected using systematic random sampling and the data were collected by using structured, pretested, and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at a cut-off point of 5 was used to assess depressive symptoms. The data were entered by Epi data version 3.1 and analyzed by SPSS version 25. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with depressive symptoms. The Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) along with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was estimated to measure the association. The level of significance was declared at a p-value of less than 0.05.The prevalence of depressive symptoms among HIV positive patients was 15.5% (95% CI: (12.4%, 19.2%)). Age 40-49 years compared to 30-39 years (AOR = 2.96, 95% CI: (1.01, 8.68)), age ≥50 years compared to 30-39 years (AOR = 3.81, 95% CI: (1.05, 13.8)), having perceived stigma (AOR = 10.2, 95%CI: (4.26, 24.4)) taking medication other than Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) (AOR = 2.58, 95% CI: (1.25, 5.33)) and history of opportunistic infections (AOR = 5.17, 95% CI: (1.31, 20.4)) were factors associated with depressive symptoms.The prevalence of depressive symptoms was low compared to previous studies. Age, perceived stigma, taking medication other than ART, and history of opportunistic infections were factors associated with depressive symptoms. Health education and counseling programs should be strengthened and target older patients, patients who took medications other than ART, patients who experienced perceived stigma and patients with a history of history opportunistic infections."
https://openalex.org/W3191751839,"Animals must attend to a diverse array of stimuli in their environments. The emotional valence and salience of a stimulus can affect how this information is processed in the brain. Many species preferentially attend to negatively valent stimuli using the sensory organs on the left side of their body and hence the right hemisphere of their brain. Here, we investigated the lateralisation of visual attention to the rapid appearance of a stimulus (an inflated balloon) designed to induce an avoidance reaction and a negatively valent emotional state in 77 Italian saddle horses. Horses’ eyes are laterally positioned on the head, and each eye projects primarily to the contralateral hemisphere, allowing eye use to be a proxy for preferential processing in one hemisphere of the brain. We predicted that horses would inspect the novel and unexpected stimulus with their left eye and hence right hemisphere. We found that horses primarily inspected the balloon with one eye, and most horses had a preferred eye to do so, however, we did not find a population level tendency for this to be the left or the right eye. The strength of this preference tended to decrease over time, with the horses using their non-preferred eye to inspect the balloon increasingly as the trial progressed. Our results confirm a lateralised eye use tendency when viewing negatively emotionally valent stimuli in horses, in agreement with previous findings. However, there was not any alignment of lateralisation at the group level in our sample, suggesting that the expression of lateralisation in horses depends on the sample population and testing context."
https://openalex.org/W3192847356,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) refers to any behavior by either a current or ex-intimate partner or would-be rejected lover that causes physical, sexual, or psychological harm. It is the most common form of violence in women's lives. According to a World Health Organization report, about 1 in 3 women worldwide experience at least one form of IPV from an intimate partner at some point in her life. In the Gambia, about 62% of pregnant women experience at least one form of violence from an intimate partner. IPV has severe physical and mental health consequences on a woman ranging from minor bodily injury to death. It also increases the risk of low birth weight, premature delivery, and neonatal death.A health facility-based cross-sectional study design was carried out to assess the magnitude and factors associated with intimate partner violence among pregnant women seeking antenatal care in the rural Gambia. The study enrolled 373 pregnant women, and a multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the respondents. An interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used to obtain information from the study participants. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS Ver.22. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine the association between dependent and independent variables. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed to determine the presence and strength of associated factors with IPV.The study reveals that the prevalence of IPV in The Gambia is 67%, with psychological violence (43%) being the most common form of IPV reported by the respondents. The multivariate logistic regression result reveals that being aged 35 years or older [AOR 5.1(95% CI 1.5-17.8)], the experience of parents quarreling during childhood [AOR 1.7(95% CI 1.0-2.75)], and having cigarette smoking partners [AOR 2.3 (95% CI 1.10-4.6)] were significantly associated with IPV during pregnancy.This study has demonstrated that all forms of IPV in rural Gambia are frequent. Women older than 35 years, had experienced parents quarreling, had a partner who smoked, and a partner who fight with others were more likely report IPV compared to other pregnant women in the study. We recommend that IPV screening should be included as an integral part of routine antenatal care services in The Gambia. Community-based interventions that include indigenous leaders, religious leaders, and other key stakeholders are crucial to create awareness on all forms of IPV and address the risk factors found to influence the occurrence of IPV in rural Gambia."

There are significant differences in the development of laying hens feeding in different regions. It is of great significance to improve egg production and reduce pollution emission for China's laying hens industry. Based on the SBM model, this paper constructs MML index, considering unexpected output under common frontier, to comprehensively evaluate the green total factor productivity on Chinese laying hens (GTCL). The results show that: (1) GTCL shows a large spatial and temporal differentiation under both the common frontier and the regional frontier. Compared with the eastern region and central region, the western region has obvious advantages in GTCL. (2) GTCL overall shows a downward trend, however, it emerges an upward trend in recent years. (3) Compared with small-scale and large-scale, middle-scale GTCL has advantages. According to the above empirical results, combined with the China's actual national situation, this paper finally puts forward some policy recommendations to improve GTCL."
https://openalex.org/W3187701055,"Exotic pests have caused huge losses to agriculture, forestry, and human health. Analyzing information on all concerned pest species and their origin will help to improve the inspection procedures and will help to clarify the relative risks of imported cargo and formulate international trade policies. Records of intercepted pests from wood packaging materials (WPM) from 2003 to 2016 in the China Port Information Network (CPIN) database were analyzed. Results showed that the number of intercepted pests from WPM was lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth one. The total number of interceptions increased each year, with 53.33% of intercepted insects followed by nematodes (31.54%). The original continent of most intercepted pests was Asia (49.29%). Xylophagous insects were primarily intercepted from Southeast Asian countries, whereas nematodes were primarily intercepted from Korea, Australia, Mexico, and other countries. WPM interception records were mainly concentrated in China's coastal inspection stations (98.7%), with the largest number of interceptions documented in Shanghai, followed by the inspection stations of Jiangsu Province. The proportion of pest taxa intercepted by the Chinese provinces' stations each year is becoming increasingly balanced. The number of pest disposal treatment measures for intercepted cargoes with dead non-quarantine pests increased significantly from 2012 to 2016. This reflects the fact that Chinese customs inspection stations are becoming increasingly scientific and standardizing the interception and treatment of WPM pests. The issues reflected in the database, with a view to providing a reference for future work by customs officers and researchers."
https://openalex.org/W3188429098,"Some studies have found a bilingual advantage in children’s executive function and some failed to find a bilingual advantage. For example, the results of a previous study by Bialystok &amp; Martin (2004) indicated that Chinese-English bilingual preschool children outperformed English monolingual children in solving the dimensional change card sort (DCCS). The goal of our study was to replicate this study using the same dimensional change card sort task. We also tested our participants on vocabulary and digit span. Our participants were 40 English monolingual and 40 Mandarin-English bilingual children and were within the same age range as the children in Bialystok &amp; Martin’s (2004) study. Our results showed no difference between bilinguals and monolinguals. Both groups of children in the present study performed better than those in Bialystok and Martin (2004), but the bigger difference was between the two groups of monolinguals. These results suggest that it could be important to attend to monolingual children’s performance, in addition to bilinguals’, when testing for a bilingual advantage. Our replication study is important because it helps with clarifying the validity of studies finding a bilingual advantage and to help future researchers know whether to build on their findings or not."
https://openalex.org/W3189281877,"Accurate and timely diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is clinically essential, and is required also to monitor confirmed cases aiming to prevent further spread. Positive real-time PCR results at late time points following initial diagnosis may be clinically misleading as this methodology cannot account for the infection capabilities and the existence of whole genome sequences. In this study, 47 serial respiratory samples were tested by Allplex-nCoV test (Seegene), a triplex of three assays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP, E and N genes and subsequently assessed by next generation sequencing (NGS). COVID19 patients were tested at an early stage of the disease, when all these viral gene targets were positive, and at an advanced stage, when only the N gene target was positive in the Allplex-nCoV test. The corresponding NGS results showed the presence of complete viral genome copies at both early and advanced stages of the disease, although the total number of mapped sequences was lower in samples from advanced disease stages. We conclude that reduced viral transmission at this late disease stage may result from the low quantities of complete viral sequences and not solely from transcription favoring the N gene."

This cross-sectional study enrolled healthy participants who experienced the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes and their aftershocks. Participants completed a questionnaire survey on their symptoms and experiences after the earthquakes. The primary outcome was the occurrence of dizziness and the secondary outcome was the presence of autonomic dysfunction and anxiety. Among 4,231 eligible participants, 1,543 experienced post-earthquake dizziness. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age (≥21, P < .001), female sex (P < .001), floor on which the individual was at the time (≥3, P = .007), tinnitus/ear fullness (P < .001), anxiety (P < .001), symptoms related to autonomic dysfunction (P = .04), and prior history of motion sickness (P = .002) were significantly associated with the onset of post-earthquake dizziness. Thus suggesting that earthquake-related effects significantly affect inner ear symptoms, autonomic function, and psychological factors. Earthquake-induced disequilibrium may be further influenced by physical stressors, including sensory disruptions induced by earthquake vibrations, changes in living conditions, and autonomic stress. This study increases our understanding of human equilibrium in response to natural disasters."

https://openalex.org/W3191214007,"Nepotism was initially theoretically predicted and sometimes found to trigger the selection of specific larvae to be reared as queens in the honeybee Apis mellifera . Although the importance of selecting the next queen for a colony indicates that it should not occur at random, nepotism is increasingly considered unlikely in eusocial insect societies. Different prenatal maternal supplies of embryos have been found to impact fitness in many other species and therefore could be a possible trigger underlying the likelihood of being raised as a queen. We offered related or unrelated larvae from six colonies originating from eggs of different weights for emergency queen rearing in queenless units with worker bees from these six colonies. We showed that nurses did not significantly prefer related larvae during queen rearing, which confirms the theory that different relatedness-driven kin preferences within a colony cannot be converted into a colony-level decision. However, we found that larvae originating from heavier eggs were significantly preferred for queen breeding. Studies on other species have shown that superior maternal supply is important for later reproductive success. However, we did observe tendencies in the expected direction (e.g., queens that hatched from heavier eggs had both more ovarioles and a shorter preoviposition period). Nevertheless, our data do not allow for a significant conclusion that the selection of larvae from heavy eggs truly offers fitness advantages."
https://openalex.org/W3129999195,"Given multiple source datasets with labels, how can we train a target model with no labeled data? Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) aims to train a model using multiple source datasets different from a target dataset in the absence of target data labels. MSDA is a crucial problem applicable to many practical cases where labels for the target data are unavailable due to privacy issues. Existing MSDA frameworks are limited since they align data without considering labels of the features of each domain. They also do not fully utilize the target data without labels and rely on limited feature extraction with a single extractor. In this paper, we propose Multi-EPL, a novel method for MSDA. Multi-EPL exploits label-wise moment matching to align the conditional distributions of the features for the labels, uses pseudolabels for the unavailable target labels, and introduces an ensemble of multiple feature extractors for accurate domain adaptation. Extensive experiments show that Multi-EPL provides the state-of-the-art performance for MSDA tasks in both image domains and text domains, improving the accuracy by up to 13.20%."

However, its safety in obese patients has not yet been verified. This is the first study on reduced-port laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (RpLDG) in obese patients with gastric cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the short-term surgical outcomes and investigate the feasibility and safety of RpLDG in obese patients with gastric carcinoma.A total of 271 gastric cancer patients who underwent RpLDG at our institution were divided into two groups: non-obese [body mass index (BMI) <30 kg/m2, n = 251; NOG] and obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2, n = 20; OG). The mean age of the enrolled patients was 64.8 ± 11.4 years, with 72.0% being men and 28.0% women. Operative details and short-term surgical outcomes, including hospital course and postoperative complications, were compared by retrospectively reviewing the medical records.No significant difference in operation time was found between the NOG and OG (205.9 ± 40.0 vs. 211.3 ± 37.3 minutes, P = 0.563). Other operative outcomes in the OG, including estimated blood loss (54.1 ± 86.1 vs. 54.0 ± 39.0 mL, P = 0.995) and retrieved lymph nodes (36.2 ± 16.4 vs. 35.5 ± 18.2, P = 0.875), were not inferior to those in the NOG. There were also no statistical differences in short-term surgical outcomes, including the incidence of surgical complications (13.9% vs. 10.0%, P = 1).RpLDG can be performed safely in obese gastric cancer patients by an experienced surgeon. It should be considered a feasible alternative to conventional port distal gastrectomy."

Epidemiological evidence has linked elevated levels of blood cholesterol with the risk of coronary heart disease. However, lipid-lowering agents, despite their importance for primary prevention, are significantly underused in the United States. The objective of this study was to explore associations among socioeconomic factors and the use of antihyperlipidemic agents in 2018 in U.S. patients with hyperlipidemia by applying a theoretical framework. Data from the 2018 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey were used to identify the population of non-institutionalized U.S. civilians diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. This cross sectional study applied the Andersen Behavioral Model to identify patients' predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Approximately 43 million non-institutionalized adults were diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. With the exception of gender and race, predisposing factors indicated significant differences between patients who used antihyperlipidemic agents and those who did not. The relation between income level and use of antihyperlipidemic agents was significant: X2 (4, N = 3,781) = 7.09, p <.001. Hispanic patients were found to be less likely to receive treatment (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.43-0.88), as observed using a logistic model, with controls for predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Patients without health insurance were less likely to use lipid-lowering agents (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.14-0.77). The present study offers essential data for prioritizing interventions by health policy makers by identifying barriers in utilizing hyperlipidemia therapy. Non-adherence to treatment may lead to severe consequences and increase the frequency of fatal cardiac events in the near future."

However, existing works on POI recommendation focus on cost (time or money) of travel for a user. An important geographical aspect that has not been studied adequately is the neighborhood effect, which captures a user's POI visiting behavior based on the user's preference not only to a POI, but also to the POI's neighborhood. To provide an interpretable framework to fully study the neighborhood effect, first, we develop different sets of insightful features, representing different aspects of neighborhood effect. We employ a Yelp data set to evaluate how different aspects of the neighborhood effect affect a user's POI visiting behavior. Second, we propose a deep learning-based recommendation framework that exploits the neighborhood effect. Experimental results show that our approach is more effective than two state-of-the-art matrix factorization-based POI recommendation techniques."

https://openalex.org/W3192140637,"Objectives In alcoholic hepatitis (AH), dysfunctional T lymphocytes may contribute to the high mortality from infections. T lymphocyte activation is governed by the expression of co-stimulatory receptors such as 4-1BB balanced by inhibitory receptors such as Programmed Death receptor 1 (PD-1). 4-1BB expression is unaccounted for in AH, while PD-1 is elevated. We characterized expression of 4-1BB and PD-1 and the associated T lymphocyte functional status in AH and investigated whether these were associated with short-term mortality. Methods Thirty-five patients with AH (at diagnosis and days 7 and 90) were compared with healthy controls (HC). Spontaneous and in vitro stimulated receptor expression were quantified by flow cytometry, and plasma proteins by ELISA. Results At diagnosis, the patients showed increased stimulated 4-1BB responses of CD4 + T lymphocytes. Also, the frequencies of PD-1 + T lymphocytes both with and without co-expressed 4-1BB were increased. Further, interferon-gamma was predominantly produced in T lymphocytes co-expressing 4-1BB. A decrease in the frequency of spontaneous 4-1BB + T lymphocytes and an increase in soluble 4-1BB during the first week after diagnosis were associated with higher mortality at day 90 in AH. PD-1 expression showed no systematic dynamics related to mortality. Conclusions We found an increased stimulated 4-1BB response of T lymphocytes in AH and early loss of these lymphocytes was associated with a higher short-term mortality. This suggests a role of T lymphocyte 4-1BB expression in the progression of AH."

On the other hand, its benefit has not been evaluated in a real-world situation. This study examined the effects of IHT on the short- and long-term mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and compared the reperfusion treatments and resources between the referring and receiving hospitals.Patients newly diagnosed with AMI and admitted to hospital were selected from the national health insurance database from 2004 to 2018. The 30-day and one-year mortality in the transferred and non-transferred patients were estimated and compared using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting to account for confounding bias.Of the 258,291 participants, 10,158 were transferred to one or more hospitals. IHT was more likely to occur to older or more comorbid people, patients in rural areas, and those whose insurance was medical aid. The 30-day and one-year mortality of the non-IHT group was 9.7% and 15.8%, respectively, whereas the figure was 11.4% and 20.5% in the IHT group. After balancing the baseline characteristics, the transferred patients were 1.12 (95% CI: 1.06-1.20) and 1.25 (95% CI: 1.20-1.31) times more likely to die during the subsequent 30 days and one year, respectively, than those treated solely at the presenting hospital. In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the hazard ratios of the 30-day and 1-year mortality were 1.14 (95% CI: 0.97-1.35) and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.15-1.49) in the transferred patients after balancing cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest. On-site thrombolysis was rarely performed in the referring hospitals.Patients transferred for the treatment of AMI experienced higher short- and long-term mortality. Therefore, onsite thrombolysis and the estimated time delay to PCI should be considered in regional hospitals to reduce mortality with the organization of STEMI treatment networks."
https://openalex.org/W3193102080,"We form impressions of others by observing their constant and dynamically-shifting facial expressions during conversation and other daily life activities. However, conventional aging research has mainly considered the changing characteristics of the skin, such as wrinkles and age-spots, within very limited states of static faces. In order to elucidate the range of aging impressions that we make in daily life, it is necessary to consider the effects of facial movement. This study investigated the effects of facial movement on age impressions. An age perception test using Japanese women as face models was employed to verify the effects of the models’ age-dependent facial movements on age impression in 112 participants (all women, aged 20–49 years) as observers. Further, the observers’ gaze was analyzed to identify the facial areas of interests during age perception. The results showed that cheek movement affects age impressions, and that the impressions increase depending on the model’s age. These findings will facilitate the development of new means of provoking a more youthful impression by approaching anti-aging from a different viewpoint of facial movement."
https://openalex.org/W3130254507,"Abstract China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and there are significant differences in the development of pig breeding in different regions. As the main component of Chinese residents’ daily meat consumption, it is of great significance to improve people's living standards and conform to the national sustainable development strategy to raise pork production and reduce pollution emissions. In view of this, based on the minimum distance to weak efficient frontier model, this paper constructs Metafrontier-Malmquist-Luenberger index considering negative output under the common frontier to comprehensively evaluate pig breeding green total factor productivity (PBG). The results manifest that: (1) No matter under the common frontier or the group frontier, PBG presents large temporal and spatial differentiation characteristics. Compared with the eastern region and the central region, the western region has obvious advantages in PBG. (2) PBG has shown a downward trend as a whole, which is mainly due to the technical retrogression. (3) Compared with small-scale and medium-sized PBG, large-scale PBG has apparent superiorities. Based on the above outcomes, combined with the actual situation of China, this paper finally raises policy recommendations for improving PBG."
https://openalex.org/W3187338602,"Nowadays, forensic authorship authentication plays a vital role in identifying the number of unknown authors as a result of the world's rapidly rising internet use. This paper presents two-level learning techniques for authorship authentication. The learning technique is supplied with linguistic knowledge, statistical features, and vocabulary features to enhance its efficiency instead of learning only. The linguistic knowledge is represented through lexical analysis features such as part of speech. In this study, a two-level classifier has been presented to capture the best predictive performance for identifying authorship. The first classifier is based on vocabulary features that detect the frequency with which each author uses certain words. This classifier's results are fed to the second one which is based on a learning technique. It depends on lexical, statistical and linguistic features. All of the three sets of features describe the author's writing styles in numerical forms. Through this work, many new features are proposed for identifying the author's writing style. Although, the proposed new methodology is tested for Arabic writings, it is general and can be applied to any language. According to the used machine learning models, the experiment carried out shows that the trained two-level classifier achieves an accuracy ranging from 94% to 96.16%."
https://openalex.org/W3188379127,"Assessments regarding health aspects of Iberian leuciscids are limited. There is currently an information gap regarding effects of infectious diseases on these populations and their role as a possible conservation threat. Moreover, differences in susceptibility to particular agents, such as Aeromonas spp., by different species/populations is not clear. To understand potential differences in Aeromonas diversity and load, as well as in the prevalence and proportion of skin lesions, in fishes exposed to similar environmental conditions, an observational study was implemented. Using a set of 12 individuals belonging to two sympatric Iberian leuciscid species (Squalius pyrenaicus and Iberochondrostoma lusitanicum), the skin lesion score in each individual was analyzed. Furthermore, a bacterial collection of Aeromonas spp. isolated from each individual was created and isolates' load was quantified by plate counting, identified at species level using a multiplex-PCR assay and virulence profiles established using classical phenotypic methods. The similarity relationships of the isolates were evaluated using a RAPD analysis. The skin lesion score was significantly higher in S. pyrenaicus, while the Aeromonas spp. load did not differ between species. When analyzing Aeromonas species diversity between fishes, different patterns were observed. A predominance of A. hydrophila was detected in S. pyrenaicus individuals, while I. lusitanicum individuals displayed a more diverse structure. Similarly, the virulence index of isolates from S. pyrenaicus was higher, mostly due to the isolated Aeromonas species. Genomic typing clustered the isolates mainly by fish species and skin lesion score. Specific Aeromonas clusters were associated with higher virulence indexes. Current results suggest potential differences in susceptibility to Aeromonas spp. at the fish species/individual level, and constitute important knowledge for proper wildlife management through the signalization of at-risk fish populations and hierarchization of conservation measures."
https://openalex.org/W3188406835,"Objective Non-professional care provided in domestic settings by a family member or someone from the close environment and without a connection to a professional care service, is increasingly assumed by older people, mainly the spouses of those requiring care. The aim of this study was to describe the experience of older people providing care at home to older dependents. Methods A qualitative study was carried out to describe and explore the experience of older people, caregivers of dependent older people in the home. Results Four themes emerged as a result of the analysis: interpersonal relationships established in the caregivers’ immediate environment; the need and request for public and private resources; consequences of providing care during old age; and adaptation to the circumstance of being a caregiver during old age. Older people who provide home-based care, experience their situation as stressful, feel that it limits their daily life, deprives them of their freedom, and affects their interpersonal relationships and social activities. Discussion Older caregivers learn quickly and can manage the skills issues. The volume of work is their challenge. Interpersonal relationships are altered depending on the length of time spent together and the demand for care. Public services and benefits are not adapted to the demands of caregivers or dependent persons."
https://openalex.org/W3189559956,"Non-microbial methane (NM-CH4), emissions from soil might play a significant role in carbon cycling and global climate change. However, the production mechanisms and emission potential of soil NM-CH4 from tropical rainforest remain highly uncertain. In order to explore the laws and characteristics of NM-CH4 emission from tropical rainforest soils. Incubation experiments at different environmental conditions (temperatures, soil water contents, hydrogen peroxide) and for soils with different soil organic carbon (SOC) contents were conducted to investigate the NM-CH4 emission characteristics and its influence factors of soils (0-10cm) that collected from a tropical rainforest in Hainan, China. Incubation results illustrated that soil NM-CH4 release showed a linear increase with the incubation time in the first 24 hours at 70 °C, whereas the logarithmic curve increase was found in 192 h incubation. Soil NM-CH4 emission rates under aerobic condition were significantly higher than that of under anaerobic condition at first 24 h incubation. The increasing of temperature, suitable soil water contents (0-100%), and hydrogen peroxide significantly promoted soil NM-CH4 emission rates at the first 24 h incubation. However, excessive soil water contents (200%) inhibited soil NM-CH4 emissions. According to the curve simulated from the NM-CH4 emission rates and incubation time at 70 °C of aerobic condition, soil would no longer release NM-CH4 after 229 h incubation. The NM-CH4 emissions were positively corelated with SOC contents, and the average soil NM-CH4 emission potential was about 6.91 ug per gram organic carbon in the tropical mountain rainforest. This study revealed that soils in the tropical rainforest could produce NM-CH4 under certain environment conditions and it supported production mechanisms of thermal degradation and reactive oxygen species oxidation. Those results could provide a basic data for understanding the soil NM-CH4 production mechanisms and its potential in the tropical rainforest."
https://openalex.org/W3189726720,"To investigate the impact of the use of different imaging units and projections on radiation dose and image quality during chest digital radiography (DR) in 3- and 4-year-old children.Two hundred forty 3- and 4-year-old participants requiring chest DR were included; they were divided into three groups: supine anterior-posterior projection (APP), standing APP and standing posterior-anterior projection (PAP). Each group included 40 participants who were evaluated using the same imaging unit. The dose area product (DAP) and the entrance surface dose (ESD) were recorded after each exposure. The visual grading analysis score (VGAS) was used to evaluate image quality, and the longitudinal distance (LD) from the apex of the right lung to the apex of the right diaphragm was used to evaluate the inspiration extent.DAP and ESD were significantly lower in the standing PAP and APP groups than in the supine APP group (P<0.05), but LD was significantly higher in the standing PAP and APP groups than in the supine APP group (P<0.05). Additionally, the pulmonary field area was significantly higher for the standing PAP group than for the standing and supine APP groups (P<0.05). The correlations between ESD, DAP, and VGAS were positive (P<0.001), showing that larger ESD and DAP correspond to higher VGAS. The correlations between ESD, DAP, and body mass index (BMI) were also positive (P<0.05), indicating that higher BMI corresponds to larger ESD and DAP. Finally, no differences in DAP, ESD, VGAS, LD, pulmonary field area, or BMI were noted between males and females (P>0.05).The radiation dose to superficial organs may be lower with standing PAP than with standing APP during chest DR. Standing PAP should be selected for chest DR in 3- and 4-year-old children, as it may decrease the required radiation dose."
