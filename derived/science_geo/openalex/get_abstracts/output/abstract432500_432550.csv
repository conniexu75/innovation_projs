https://openalex.org/W2037219928,"Increased cell motility and survival are important hallmarks of metastatic tumor cells. However, the mechanisms that regulate the interplay between these cellular processes remain poorly understood. In these studies, we demonstrate that CCL2, a chemokine well known for regulating immune cell migration, plays an important role in signaling to breast cancer cells. We report that in a panel of mouse and human breast cancer cell lines CCL2 enhanced cell migration and survival associated with increased phosphorylation of Smad3 and p42/44MAPK proteins. The G protein-coupled receptor CCR2 was found to be elevated in breast cancers, correlating with CCL2 expression. RNA interference of CCR2 expression in breast cancer cells significantly inhibited CCL2-induced migration, survival, and phosphorylation of Smad3 and p42/44MAPK proteins. Disruption of Smad3 expression in mammary carcinoma cells blocked CCL2-induced cell survival and migration and partially reduced p42/44MAPK phosphorylation. Ablation of MAPK phosphorylation in Smad3-deficient cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 further reduced cell survival but not migration. These data indicate that Smad3 signaling through MEK-p42/44MAPK regulates CCL2-induced cell motility and survival, whereas CCL2 induction of MEK-p42/44MAPK signaling independent of Smad3 functions as an alternative mechanism for cell survival. Furthermore, we show that CCL2-induced Smad3 signaling through MEK-p42/44MAPK regulates expression and activity of Rho GTPase to mediate CCL2-induced breast cancer cell motility and survival. With these studies, we characterize an important role for CCL2/CCR2 chemokine signaling in regulating the intrinsic relationships between breast cancer cell motility and survival with implications on the metastatic process."
https://openalex.org/W2058260807,"Tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the broadly used Chinese medicinal herb Stephaniae tetrandrae, exhibits potent antitumor effects and has the potential to be used as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent. We previously reported that high concentrations of tetrandrine induce apoptosis in liver cancer cells. Here, we found that in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, a low dose of tetrandrine (5 μm) induced the expression of LC3-II, resulted in the formation of acidic autophagolysosome vacuoles (AVOs), and caused a punctate fluorescence pattern with the GFP-LC3 protein, which all are markers for cellular autophagy. Tetrandrine induced the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and treatment with ROS scavengers significantly abrogated the tetrandrine-induced autophagy. These results suggest that the generation of ROS plays an important role in promoting tetrandrine-induced autophagy. Tetrandrine-induced mitochondrial dysfunction resulted in ROS accumulation and autophagy. ROS generation activated the ERK MAP kinase, and the ERK signaling pathway at least partially contributed to tetrandrine-induced autophagy in HCC cells. Moreover, we found that tetrandrine transcriptionally regulated the expression of autophagy related gene 7 (ATG7), which promoted tetrandrine-induced autophagy. In addition to in vitro studies, similar results were also observed in vivo, where tetrandrine caused the accumulation of ROS and induced cell autophagy in a tumor xenograft model. Interestingly, tetrandrine treatment also induced autophagy in a ROS-dependent manner in C. elegans muscle cells. Therefore, these findings suggest that tetrandrine is a potent autophagy agonist and may be a promising clinical chemotherapeutic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2033964863,"Deregulation of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signal transduction cascade is functionally linked to cancer. In early phases, TGFβ acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, whereas in late phases, it can act as a tumor promoter by stimulating tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Smad transcriptional effectors mediate TGFβ responses, but relatively little is known about the Smad-containing complexes that are important for epithelial–mesenchymal transition and invasion. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that specific members of the AP-1 transcription factor family determine TGFβ signaling specificity in breast cancer cell invasion. Using a 3D model of collagen-embedded spheroids of MCF10A-MII premalignant human breast cancer cells, we identified the AP-1 transcription factor components c-Jun, JunB, c-Fos and Fra1 as essential factors for TGFβ-induced invasion and found that various mesenchymal and invasion-associated TGFβ-induced genes are co-regulated by these proteins. In situ proximity ligation assays showed that TGFβ signaling not only induces complexes between Smad3 and Smad4 in the nucleus but also complexes between Smad2/3 and Fra1, whereas complexes between Smad3, c-Jun and JunB could already be detected before TGFβ stimulation. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitations showed that c-Jun, JunB and Fra1, but not c-Fos, are required for TGFβ-induced binding of Smad2/3 to the mmp-10 and pai-1 promoters. Together these results suggest that in particular formation of Smad2/3-Fra1 complexes may reflect activation of the Smad/AP-1-dependent TGFβ-induced invasion program."
https://openalex.org/W1998564647,"Dysregulation of micro RNAs is crucially implicated in tumorigenesis. We detected downregulation of miR-100 in breast cancer cells, leading to an upregulation of the proliferation- and survival-promoting oncogene insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 2. Stable overexpression of miR-100 strongly reduced IGF2 expression and inhibited tumor growth. In invasive human breast tumors, miR-100 was reduced about fourfold as compared with benign patient samples, whereas IGF2 was strongly enhanced. MiR-100 has also been shown to suppress other proteins of the IGF/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade in different human tumors. Our results reveal miR-100 as a context-dependent master regulator of the IGF/mTOR pathway and a potential target for therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2049750041,"Among primates, human neonates have the largest brains but also the highest proportion of body fat. If placental nutrient supply is limited, the fetus faces a dilemma: should resources be allocated to brain growth, or to fat deposition for use as a potential postnatal energy reserve? We hypothesised that resolving this dilemma operates at the level of umbilical blood distribution entering the fetal liver. In 381 uncomplicated pregnancies in third trimester, we measured blood flow perfusing the fetal liver, or bypassing it via the ductus venosus to supply the brain and heart using ultrasound techniques. Across the range of fetal growth and independent of the mother's adiposity and parity, greater liver blood flow was associated with greater offspring fat mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, both in the infant at birth (r = 0.43, P<0.001) and at age 4 years (r = 0.16, P = 0.02). In contrast, smaller placentas less able to meet fetal demand for essential nutrients were associated with a brain-sparing flow pattern (r = 0.17, p = 0.02). This flow pattern was also associated with a higher degree of shunting through ductus venosus (P = 0.04). We propose that humans evolved a developmental strategy to prioritize nutrient allocation for prenatal fat deposition when the supply of conditionally essential nutrients requiring hepatic inter-conversion is limited, switching resource allocation to favour the brain if the supply of essential nutrients is limited. Facilitated placental transfer mechanisms for glucose and other nutrients evolved in environments less affluent than those now prevalent in developed populations, and we propose that in circumstances of maternal adiposity and nutrient excess these mechanisms now also lead to prenatal fat deposition. Prenatal developmental influences play important roles in the human propensity to deposit fat."
https://openalex.org/W1997505618,"The genes encoding β-actin (ACTB in human or Actb in mouse) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH in human or Gapdh in mouse) are the two most commonly used references for sample normalization in determination of the mRNA level of interested genes by reverse transcription (RT) and ensuing polymerase chain reactions (PCR). In this study, bioinformatic analyses revealed that the ACTB, Actb, GAPDH and Gapdh had 64, 69, 67 and 197 pseudogenes (PGs), respectively, in the corresponding genome. Most of these PGs are intronless and similar in size to the authentic mRNA. Alignment of several PGs of these genes with the corresponding mRNA reveals that they are highly homologous. In contrast, the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1 gene (HPRT1 in human or Hprt in mouse) only had 3 or 1 PG, respectively, and the mRNA has unique regions for primer design. PCR with cDNA or genomic DNA (gDNA) as templates revealed that our HPRT1, Hprt and GAPDH primers were specific, whereas our ACTB and Actb primers were not specific enough both vertically (within the cDNA) and horizontally (compared cDNA with gDNA). No primers could be designed for the Gapdh that would not mis-prime PGs. Since most of the genome is transcribed, we suggest to peers to forgo ACTB (Actb) and GAPDH (Dapdh) as references in RT-PCR and, if there is no surrogate, to use our primers with extra caution. We also propose a standard operation procedure in which design of primers for RT-PCR starts from avoiding mis-priming PGs and all primers need be tested for specificity with both cDNA and gDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1981678052,"There is accumulating evidence that following bacterial infection, the massive recruitment and activation of the phagocytes, neutrophils, is accompanied with the extracellular release of active neutrophil elastase (NE), a potent serine protease. Using NE-deficient mice in a clinically relevant model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced pneumonia, we provide compelling in vivo evidence that the absence of NE was associated with decreased protein and transcript levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, MIP-2, and IL-6 in the lungs, coinciding with increased mortality of mutant mice to infection. The implication of NE in the induction of cytokine expression involved at least in part Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4). These findings were further confirmed following exposure of cultured macrophages to purified NE. Together, our data suggest strongly for the first time that NE not only plays a direct antibacterial role as it has been previously reported, but released active enzyme can also modulate cytokine expression, which contributes to host protection against P. aeruginosa. In light of our findings, the long held view that considers NE as a prime suspect in P. aeruginosa-associated diseases will need to be carefully reassessed. Also, therapeutic strategies aiming at NE inhibition should take into account the physiologic roles of the enzyme.

Inflammation is a physiological reaction of the host to protect itself from insulting agents such as pathogens. This complex and dynamic process is characterized by an innate immune response, which involves a coordinated expression of inflammatory cytokines and implication of various cell types particularly immune cells aimed at clearing the pathogenic agent. In the setting of respiratory bacterial infections (e.g. bacterial pneumonia), the host innate immune response is characterized by the initial recognition of invading microbes by host “sentinel” cells via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3The abbreviations used are: TLRToll-like receptorPMNpolymorphonuclear neutrophilNEneutrophil elastaseAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluorideSLPIsecretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitorBALbronchoalveolar lavageMyD88myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88IRAKinterleukin-1 receptor-associated kinaseTRAF6TNF receptor associated factor 6NF-κBnuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cellsLPSlipopolysaccharideMIP-2macrophage inflammatory protein-2. or other pattern recognition molecules (1Kolls J.K. McCray Jr., P.B. Chan Y.R. Cytokine-mediated regulation of antimicrobial proteins.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this results in the production of an array of inflammatory mediators including early responsive cytokines. Another hallmark of innate host lung defense, especially when the first lines of defense: epithelial barrier and resident macrophages, are breached is the massive recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to the infected site (2Mizgerd J.P. Acute lower respiratory tract infection.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 716-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). PMNs are efficient phagocytes whose main function upon activation is thought to be the clearance of infecting bacteria. To do so, these cells are equipped with a myriad of antimicrobial molecules grouped into oxidative and nonoxidative systems (3Ganz T. Oxygen-independent microbicidal mechanisms of phagocytes.Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1999; 111: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 4Hampton M.B. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Inside the neutrophil phagosome.

Regarding the nonoxidative system, we and others have identified the PMN-specific serine protease, neutrophil elastase (NE), as a key antimicrobial enzyme (5Belaaouaj A. McCarthy R. Baumann M. Gao Z. Ley T.J. Abraham S.N. Shapiro S.D. Mice lacking neutrophil elastase reveal impaired host defense against Gram-negative bacterial sepsis.Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). NE catalytic activity relies on the His57-Asp102-Ser195 triad (chymotrypsin numbering system), where Ser represents the active residue (6Bode W. Meyer Jr., E. Powers J.C. Human leukocyte and porcine pancreatic elastase. X-ray crystal structures, mechanism, substrate specificity, and mechanism-based inhibitors.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1951-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). NE, a cationic glycoprotein, is stored in readily active form in PMN primary granules at concentrations exceeding millimolar range making it a major component of PMN (7Liou T.G. Campbell E.J. Nonisotropic enzyme–inhibitor interactions. A novel nonoxidative mechanism for quantum proteolysis by human neutrophils.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16171-16177Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Gene targeting of NE in mice revealed that the enzyme contributes significantly to host protection against microbial infections (8Reeves E.P. Lu H. Jacobs H.L. Messina C.G. Bolsover S. Gabella G. Potma E.O. Warley A. Roes J. Segal A.W. Killing activity of neutrophils is mediated through activation of proteases by K+ flux.Nature. 2002; 416: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). In determining NE-mediated defense against Gram-negative bacteria, it was shown that active enzyme degrades the major outer membrane protein (Omp), structural proteins localized on the cell wall (9Belaaouaj A. Kim K.S. Shapiro S.D. Degradation of outer membrane protein A in Escherichia coli killing by neutrophil elastase.Science. 2000; 289: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 10Hirche T.O. Benabid R. Deslee G.

Immunol. 2008; 181: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). NE also has the capacity to attenuate the pathogenicity of invading microbes by targeting their virulence factors (11López-Boado Y.S. Espinola M. Bahr S. Belaaouaj A. Neutrophil serine proteinases cleave bacterial flagellin, abrogating its host response-inducing activity.J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In recent years, it was shown that NE binds to PMN-derived chromatin structures, termed neutrophil extracellular traps, and exerts its antimicrobial function (12Weinrauch Y. Drujan D. Shapiro S.D. Weiss J. Zychlinsky A. Neutrophil elastase targets virulence factors of enterobacteria.Nature. 2002; 417: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Although NE has been always regarded as pathogenic in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-associated tissue inflammatory and destructive diseases, we have recently provided compelling in vivo evidence that the enzyme contributes considerably to PMN-mediated host protection in a mouse model of P. aeruginosa-induced pneumonia (10Hirche T.O. Benabid R. Deslee G. Gangloff S. Achilefu S. Guenounou M. Lebargy F. Hancock R.E. Belaaouaj A. Neutrophil elastase mediates innate host protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). There is also accumulating evidence that during P. aeruginosa infections, active NE is released in the extracellular milieu by recruited PMNs (13Birrer P. Proteases and antiproteases in cystic fibrosis. Pathogenetic considerations and therapeutic strategies.Respiration. 1995; 62: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Moraes T.J. Chow C.W. Downey G.P. Proteases and lung injury.Crit. Care Med. 2003; 31: S189-S194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of in vitro studies have suggested that NE has the potential to change biologic activities of various inflammatory mediators (15Pham C.T. Neutrophil serine proteases. Specific regulators of inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations prompted us to hypothesize that the NE role in host defense against P. aeruginosa lung infection may not be only limited to just killing bacteria. Here, we report that in vivo, extracellular active NE has the capacity to induce mRNA expression of the early responsive proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6); an induction that is mediated at least in part through TLR-4. These findings were further confirmed following exposure of cultured macrophages to purified NE. Our studies reveal for the first time that extracellularly released NE can have physiologic inflammatory properties that contribute to host defense against P. aeruginosa. Purified NE and elastin were obtained from Elastin Products Co. (Owensville, MO). NE activity was determined spectrophotometrically using the specific chromogenic substrate N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA (Elastin Products Co.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Pefabloc SC®, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl-fluoride (AEBSF) and secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) were from Roche Applied Science and R&D Systems, respectively. RPMI 1640 medium, DMEM, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, streptomycin, and PBS were obtained from Invitrogen. Ketamine hydrochloride and medotomidine hydrochloride were obtained from CEVA Santé Animale (Libourne, France). Primers for semiquantitative and real time RT-PCR were purchased from Operon Biotechnologies (Cologne, Germany). SYBR Green for real time RT-PCR was obtained from Invitrogen. Polyclonal anti-murine NE antibody was produced in rabbit (16Kessenbrock K. Fröhlich L. Sixt M. Lämmermann T. Pfister H. Bateman A. Belaaouaj A. Ring J. Ollert M. Fässler R. Jenne D.E. Proteinase 3 and neutrophil elastase enhance inflammation in mice by inactivating anti-inflammatory progranulin.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2438-2447PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody raised against amino acids 198–395 of mouse TLR-4 (sc-293072) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals were reagent grade and purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. Of note, glassware used in the study were LPS-free and when appropriate, reagents especially purified for NE were tested for LPS contamination by the Limulus amebocyte-lysate assay (E-toxate, Sigma). NE-deficient (NE−/−) mice were generated by targeted mutagenesis as previously described (5Belaaouaj A. McCarthy R. Baumann M. Gao Z. Ley T.J. Abraham S.N. Shapiro S.D. Mice lacking neutrophil elastase reveal impaired host defense against Gram-negative bacterial sepsis.Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 NE−/− mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates and C3H/HeJ (TLR4−/−) and control C3H/HeN mice (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were used in this study. C3H/HeJ mice have a naturally nonresponsive TLR4. Mice were sex and age (8–10 weeks) matched and maintained in the animal barrier facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and provided with water and food ad libitum. Animal handling and procedures were approved by the Animal Studies Committee at our institution (Health and Animal Protection Office, Châlons-en-Champagne, France, authorization number 51-31) in accordance with the guidelines of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) and following the European Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used in scientific procedures. P. aeruginosa H103 was kindly provided by Dr. Hancock (Vancouver, BC, Canada). This strain is noteworthy in its inability to produce Pseudomonas metalloelastase (17Tamura Y. Suzuki S. Sawada T. Role of elastase as a virulence factor in experimental Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in mice.Microb. Pathog. 1992; 12: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An overnight bacterial culture (1 ml) was grown in Luria Bertani broth (10 ml) at 37 °C to late exponential phase (3 h). Bacteria were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4) and the optical density (OD) of the cultures was determined at 600 nm (1 OD600 nm ≈1 × 109 bacteria/ml). Two types of lung infection experiments were carried out. In the first set of experiments, to monitor the release of free active NE in function of time in the setting of infection, NE−/− and WT mice (n = 24 mice/genotype) were challenged intranasally with bacteria and sacrificed at fixed time points. Briefly, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (intraperitoneal) injection of ketamine hydrochloride (75 mg/kg) and medotomidine hydrochloride (1 mg/kg). Next, mice were challenged intranasally with 50 μl of saline buffer (PBS) containing a predetermined dose of bacteria that killed 50% of WT mice (107 CFUs/per mouse, LD50 ≈ 107 CFUs) (10Hirche T.O. Benabid R. Deslee G. Gangloff S. Achilefu S. Guenounou M. Lebargy F. Hancock R.E. Belaaouaj A. Neutrophil elastase mediates innate host protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One NE−/− mouse died during intranasal instillation. Control mice (n = 8 mice/genotype) were challenged with 50 μl of sterile PBS alone. WT mice and NE−/− mice that survived bacterial challenge were sacrificed at the designated time points of 4, 12, and 24 h post-infection (4 mice per each time point). Mouse lungs were analyzed for histology, inflammatory cell recruitment, and detection of free active NE. Of note, at the onset all NE−/− appeared clinically worse than WT mice. By 12 h, NE−/− mice exhibited signs of distress, which were markedly less severe in WT mice. At 24 h, both types of mice displayed a morbid state that was more marked in NE−/− mice. At this time point, whereas no death was recorded in WT mice 11 NE−/− mice (∼45%) died. The survival of the remaining mice was monitored up to 72 h later and in accordance with our previous report (10Hirche T.O. Benabid R. Deslee G. Gangloff S. Achilefu S. Guenounou M. Lebargy F. Hancock R.E. Belaaouaj A. Neutrophil elastase mediates innate host protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), ∼50% of WT mice survived against ∼20% of NE−/− mice. In the second set of experiments, groups of WT and NE−/− mice were challenged using experimental conditions of lung infection as above. The surviving mice (24 WT mice and 10 NE−/− mice) were then sacrificed at the 24-h time point, a time that corresponded to maximal PMN infiltration and maximal release of free active NE (Fig. 1) (10Hirche T.O. Benabid R. Deslee G. Gangloff S. Achilefu S. Guenounou M. Lebargy F. Hancock R.E. Belaaouaj A. Neutrophil elastase mediates innate host protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Control mice were sacrificed 24 h post-saline instillation. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BAL) of control and surviving mice were pooled as the following: 3 pools of control BALs (2 pools of 3 BALs and 1 of 2 BALs), 3 pools of infected WT BALs (4 BALS per pool), and 3 pools of infected NE−/− BALs (2 pools of 3 BALs and 1 of 4 BALs). In all mouse experiments, lungs were lavaged in situ using 1 ml of PBS (pH 7.4), cycled three times (18Hirche T.O. Crouch E.C. Espinola M. Brokelman T.J. Mecham R.P. DeSilva N. Cooley J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 27688-27698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Identical recoveries of BAL (700 μl/mouse) were obtained for each of the experimental groups. Both BALs and recovered lungs were processed for analysis as described below. These infection experiments were carried out twice for data reproducibility. Mouse lungs corresponding to 24 h post-infection were processed for histology analysis as previously described (18Hirche T.O. Crouch E.C. Espinola M. Brokelman T.J. Mecham R.P. DeSilva N. Cooley J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 27688-27698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Total cell counts from BAL fluids were immediately performed by a hemacytometer. For differential counts, cells were cytospun, Wright-stained, and identified using standard morphological criteria. The remaining BAL samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C and supernatants were snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C until use. J774 mouse macrophage cell line was seeded on a 24-well plate (ATGC Biotechnologies SA, Marne-la-Vallée, France) at 1 × 105 cells/well and grown for 3 days to confluence at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (19Belaaouaj A.

In separate experiments, primary macrophages were elicited to the peritonea of C57BL/6 WT mice or C3H/HeJ (TLR4−/−) and control C3H/HeN mice following intraperitoneal injection with 3 ml of 3% Brewer thioglycollate broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) (20Grandjean-Laquerriere A.

Involvement of Toll-like receptor 4 in the inflammatory reaction induced by hydroxyapatite particles.Biomaterials. 2007; 28: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Four days later, the peritonea were lavaged with 10 ml of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen). Cells were collected and washed twice in RPMI 1640 and resuspended in the medium supplemented with 1% autologous serum. Macrophages represented >95% of the cell population and >98% were viable as judged by differential counting and trypan blue dye exclusion, respectively. Cells were seeded on a 24-well tissue culture plate at 5 × 105 cells/well. Of relevance, to minimize PMN contamination and the potential confounding effect of endogenous NE, cells were cultured for 6 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 to allow macrophages to adhere and washed twice with 1 ml of medium to remove nonadherent cells including PMNs. Cells were cultured for an additional 24 h to ensure for maximal purity of adherent macrophages and absence of PMN-derived NE as judged by light microscopy of cultured cell cytospins and elastin zymography on concentrated cell-free culture media (Nanosep filter units, Life Sciences, VWR International, Radnor, PA). Prior to NE treatment, cell line or primary macrophages were washed twice with 1 ml of PBS and cultured for 1 h with corresponding serum-free medium. To determine optimal experimental conditions for maximal expression of the mediators, experiments of enzyme dose-response and time course of cell exposure to NE and culture post-treatment were carried out. J774 cells were treated with various concentrations of NE (100, 300, and 500 nm) for different times (1, 2, and 4 h), washed twice with 1 ml of PBS, and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in fresh complemented medium for different periods of time (2 and 4 h). The identified optimized conditions were applied also to primary macrophages. To ensure maximal removal of NE, culture media was checked for the absence of active NE against its specific substrate (21Hirche T.O. Gaut J.P. Heinecke J.W. Belaaouaj A. Myeloperoxidase plays critical roles in killing Klebsiella pneumoniae and inactivating neutrophil elastase. Effects on host defense.J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In parallel experiments, NE was preincubated with AEBSF (1 mm) for 5 min at 37 °C prior to addition to cells. Controls included cells cultured in the absence of NE. Under these experimental conditions, over 90% of the cells were alive, as judged by morphologic criteria and trypan blue dye exclusion. Each treatment condition was performed in triplicate and cell culture experiments were repeated at least 3 times. Cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 7.4) (Sigma) and centrifuged at 600 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Next, lysates were exposed to a fixed NE concentration (500 nm) for the defined time periods (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 5 min). In parallel experiments, NE was preincubated with SLPI (10 μg) for 5 min at 37 °C or heat inactivated for 10 min at 65 °C prior to addition to cell lysates. Cell-free WT and NE−/− BAL fluids of the 24-h time point post-infection were processed to assess the levels of various cytokines using the Raybio® Mouse Cytokine Antibody Array III according to the manufacturer's instructions (RayBiotech, Tebu-Bio, Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France) (22Velard F. Laurent-Maquin D. Guillaume C. Bouthors S. Jallot E. Nedelec J.M. Belaaouaj A. Laquerriere P. Polymorphonuclear neutrophil response to hydroxyapatite particles, implication in acute inflammatory reaction.Acta Biomater. 2009; 5: 1708-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal volumes of cell-free BAL fluids (400 μl) were added to antibody-coated membranes and detection of immunoreactive cytokines was carried out following sequential incubations of the membranes with biotinylated anti-cytokine antibodies and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence. Images were obtained with a ChemiDoc XRS imaging system (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis was performed on captured images using Quantity One one-dimensional analysis software (version 4.5.2) (Bio-Rad). Spots of interest were normalized to an internal control after subtraction of the representative background sample. Next, to determine the concentration of cytokines of interest (TNF-α, MIP-2, and IL-6), equal volumes of WT and NE−/− cell-free BAL fluids (50 μl) were processed using a multiplex bead-based immunoassay kit (Bio-Rad). Cytokine assays were performed as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Each reaction in the kit was performed in triplicate. Both cytokine antibody array and multiplex assays were performed on all BAL pools. NE or TLR-4 antigens were detected by Western blotting (18Hirche T.O. Crouch E.C. Espinola M. Brokelman T.J.

Briefly, samples (cell-free BAL fluids (20 μl) and lung or cell lysates (35 μg)) were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were sequentially incubated with primary antibodies to mouse NE (dilution, 1:2,000) or TLR-4 (dilution, 1:500) followed by their respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. When indicated, the membranes were stripped (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, for 30 min at 50 °C) and immunoblotted using primary rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse albumin antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) and its corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). NE activity was determined by α-elastin zymography (23Hirche T.O. Atkinson J.J. Bahr S. Belaaouaj A. Deficiency in neutrophil elastase does not impair neutrophil recruitment to inflamed sites.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell-free BAL fluids (20 μl) were electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions at 4 °C on 12% SDS-PAGE gels containing 1 mg/ml of elastin. Following electrophoresis, gels were soaked in 2% Triton X-100 for 30 min (twice), rinsed briefly, and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), containing 5 mm CaCl2. The gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue and destained in 5% acetic acid and 10% methanol. Active NE appears as a transparent lysis band at ∼29 kDa. NE activity in cell-free BAL fluids was further confirmed using conventional chromogenic peptide assays as previously described (21Hirche T.O. Gaut J.P. Heinecke J.W. Belaaouaj A.

Total RNA isolation was performed using MasterPureTM RNA Purification kit as described by the manufacturer's protocol (Epicenter, Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) (19Belaaouaj A. Shipley J.M.

Briefly, mouse lung tissues (half-lobe) or cultured macrophage cell pellets were lysed and RNA was extracted. Purified RNA was resuspended in RNase inhibitor-containing TE Buffer. RNA concentration and purity were determined by spectrophotometry (A260/A280 ratio). Integrity of RNA samples was verified by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and visualization under UV light. RNA aliquots of individual mice were pooled in the same manner as for BAL fluids at equal concentrations. Total RNA samples (1 μg) were reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Next, cDNAs were amplified by PCR using specific primers (40 cycles starting with DNA denaturation for 2 min at 94 °C; each cycle corresponded to denaturation for 15 s at 94 °C, primer annealing at 60 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 30 s). RT-PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and quantified by densitometry using Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad). Levels of cytokine mRNA transcripts were normalized to the internal control 28 S mRNA. RT-PCR was performed in quadruplicate within each pool. Forward and reverse primers for TNF-α, MIP-2, IL-6, and 28 S were designed as follows: TNF-α forward, 5′-GGG-ACA-GTG-ACC-TGG-ACT-GT-3′; TNF-α reverse, 5′-CTC-CCT-TTG-CAG-AAC-TCA-GC-3′; MIP-2 forward, 5′-CCA-CTC-TCA-AGG-GCG-GTC-AA-3′; MIP-2 reverse, 5′-CCC-CTT-ATC-CCC-AGT-CTC-TTT-CAC-3′; IL-6 forward, 5′-GAT-GCT-ACC-AAA-CTG-GAG-ATA-AAT-C-3′; IL-6 reverse, 5′-GGT-CCT-TAG-CCA-CTC-CTT-CTG-TG-3′; 28 S forward, 5′-CGG-AAT-TCG-CCA-CCA-GCC-GCC-TG-3′; 28 S reverse, 5′-CGT-CTA-GAC-TTT-CTC-CGT-TTA-CTT-GC-3′. Briefly, total RNA of cultured cells was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Next, real time-PCR amplification was performed on the ABI PRISMTM 7500 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) using Platinum SYBR® Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG with ROX (Invitrogen). PCR amplification conditions were as follows: initial DNA denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C, primer annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for a total 40 cycles. Data analysis was performed with the SDS Software (Applied Biosystems). Real time RT-PCR was performed in triplicate and repeated at least 3 times in each experimental condition for data reproducibility.

https://openalex.org/W2029133324,"Cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) are a class of ubiquitin ligases that control the proteasomal degradation of numerous target proteins, including IκB, and the activity of these CRLs are positively regulated by conjugation of a Nedd8 polypeptide onto Cullin proteins in a process called neddylation. CRL-mediated degradation of IκB, which normally interacts with and retains NF-κB in the cytoplasm, permits nuclear translocation and transactivation of the NF-κB transcription factor. Neddylation occurs through a multistep enzymatic process involving Nedd8 activating enzymes, and recent studies have shown that the pharmacological agent, MLN4924, can potently inhibit Nedd8 activating enzymes, thereby preventing neddylation of Cullin proteins and preventing the degradation of CRL target proteins. In macrophages, regulation of NF-κB signaling functions as a primary pathway by which infectious agents such as lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) cause the up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Here we have analyzed the effects of MLN4924, and compared the effects of MLN4924 with a known anti-inflammatory agent (dexamethasone), on certain proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and the NF-κB signaling pathway in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We also used siRNA to block neddylation to assess the role of this molecular process during LPS-induced cytokine responsiveness. Our results demonstrate that blocking neddylation, either pharmacologically or using siRNA, abrogates the increase in certain proinflammatory cytokines secreted from macrophages in response to LPS. In addition, we have shown that MLN4924 and dexamethasone inhibit LPS-induced cytokine up-regulation at the transcriptional level, albeit through different molecular mechanisms. Thus, neddylation represents a novel molecular process in macrophages that can be targeted to prevent and/or treat the LPS-induced up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and the disease processes associated with their up-regulation."

In this study, we identified Olfm1 as a molecule promoting axon growth through interaction with the Nogo A receptor (NgR1) complex. Olfm1 is coexpressed with NgR1 in dorsal root ganglia and retinal ganglion cells in embryonic and postnatal mice. Olfm1 specifically binds to NgR1, as judged by alkaline phosphatase assay and coimmunoprecipitation. The addition of Olfm1 inhibited the growth cone collapse of dorsal root ganglia neurons induced by myelin-associated inhibitors, indicating that Olfm1 attenuates the NgR1 receptor functions. Olfm1 caused the inhibition of NgR1 signaling by interfering with interaction between NgR1 and its coreceptors p75NTR or LINGO-1.

The Olfm1 protein contains an N-terminal signal peptide followed by a coiled-coil domain and an olfactomedin domain located in the C-terminal part of the protein molecule. Four structurally distinct mRNAs, named AMY, BMY, AMZ, and BMZ, are produced from the Olfm1 gene (2Barembaum M. Moreno T.A. LaBonne C. Sechrist J. Bronner-Fraser M.

Res. 1994; 38: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The olfactomedin domain is encoded by the last two 3′ exons found in the AMZ and BMZ forms. The AMY and BMY forms encode shorter forms of Olfm1 that lack the olfactomedin domain. Many previous studies indicate that the N-terminal part of Olfm1 contains the active domain of the functions. The molecular mechanisms underlying Olfm1 activities remain unclear. Considering that Olfm1 is a secreted protein, one might expect its main targets to be extracellular proteins or receptor-like molecules on the cell membrane. However, several identified binding partners of Olfm1 are expressed intracellularly. In adult mouse brain, the BMY form of Olfm1 interacts with WAVE1, an actin-reorganizing protein, and Bcl-xL, a proapoptotic factor, thereby promoting the death of neurons following ischemic injury (10Cheng A. Arumugam T.V. Liu D. Khatri R.G. Mustafa K. Kwak S. Ling H.P. Gonzales C. Xin O. Jo D.G. Guo Z. Mark R.J. Mattson M.P. Pancortin-2 interacts with WAVE1 and Bcl-xL in a mitochondria-associated protein complex that mediates ischemic neuronal death.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). β-Dystrobrevin, a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, was identified as a potential binding partner of the BMY form of Olfm1 (12Veroni C. Grasso M. Macchia G. Ramoni C. Ceccarini M. Petrucci T.C. Macioce P. β-Dystrobrevin, a kinesin-binding receptor, interacts with the extracellular matrix components pancortins.J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 2631-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), although the physiological implications of this interaction are unknown. The only identified extracellular binding partner of Olfm1 is secreted Wnt inhibitory factor 1. In zebrafish embryos, interaction of olfm1 with wnt inhibitory factor 1 led to a decrease of the anterior-posterior axial length of the ocular globe (11Nakaya N. Lee H.S. Takada Y. Tzchori I.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7900-7910Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Axonal elongation is a primary step in neural development, required before synaptic connections can be formed between distant neurons. During axonal pathfinding, glial cells provide assistance in directing growth cones toward their targets by secreting neurotrophic factors and positive guidance molecules and by expressing inhibitory membrane proteins that obstruct aberrant growth cone migration. In the adult mammalian CNS, axonal growth is largely restricted by barriers provided by glial cells (13Cafferty W.B. McGee A.W. Strittmatter S.M. Axonal growth therapeutics.

Each of these membrane proteins interacts with the Nogo A receptor complex, which consists of Nogo A receptor 1 (NgR1) and putative coreceptors (p75NTR, LINGO-1, and TROY) (16Llorens F.

TrkA, TrkB, Sdk1, Sdk2, TrkC, and DsCAM were subcloned into the pcDNA3 or p3XFLAG-CMV14 vectors (Sigma). Transfection of cDNA constructs was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or PolyJet (Signagen). Conditioned medium (CM) was replaced with fresh medium 16 h after transfection, and cells were further cultured for 48–72 h. When secretion of proteins was assessed by Western blotting, CM was replaced with serum-free medium 24 h post-transfection. PC12 cells were infected with pOlfm1 retrovirus, and a clone stably secreting the Olfm1 protein was isolated. The culture medium of Olfm1-producing cells was replaced with serum-free DMEM, which was collected 24–48 h later. Purification of Olfm1 from the CM was performed as described previously with some modifications (20Snyder D.A. Rivers A.M. Yokoe H. Menco B.P. Anholt R.R. Olfactomedin. Purification, characterization, and localization of a novel olfactory glycoprotein.Biochem. 1991; 30: 9143-9153Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). 2-Mercaptoethanol, CHAPS, and Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) were added to CM to final concentrations of 10 mm, 0.2%, and 50 mm, respectively. Lectin-agarose beads conjugated to Ricinus communis agglutinin I (20 μl/ml medium) were added to CM and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The beads were precipitated and washed five times with PBS with 0.2% CHAPS and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The bound Olfm1 was eluted with PBS-0.2% CHAPS containing 500 mm D-galactose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. After removing galactose, Olfm1 was concentrated by ultrafiltration with 10,000 kDa cutoff, filtered through a syringe filter (0.22 μm), and applied to a HiTrapTM Q XL anion exchange column (AKTA purifier, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2% CHAPS, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins bound to the column were eluted by a gradient of 0–1 M NaCl in the same buffer over 20 ml elution volume. 100-μl fractions were collected. The ten fractions with the highest concentration of Olfm1 were combined and used in subsequent experiments. Two different antibodies against Olfm1 were used. The monoclonal antibody was generated against the peptides SRDARTKQLRQLLEKVQN by the Custom Antibody Production Service of the University of Virginia. This monoclonal antibody detects a denatured protein on Western blot analyses and an antigen-retrieved protein on histological sections. A polyclonal antibody generated against purified Olfm1 was produced by Covance, Inc. This antibody detected intact Olfm1 and was used for immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments. MAG, the AMZ, BMZ, BMY, and AMZdelEx4 forms of Olfm1, were subcloned into the pAPtag2 vector (GenHunter). COS7 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding indicated alkaline phosphatase (AP) fusion proteins or vector control. The culture medium was changed to the fresh serum-free medium 24 h after the transfection, and CM was harvested 24–48 h later, filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and stored at −80 °C until use. Absolute concentration of Olfm1-AP and other AP fusion proteins as well as the integrity of the protein were determined by Western blotting with a known amount of purified Olfm1 and AP (GenHunter). Another culture of COS7 cells was transfected with a construct encoding tested membrane protein. The expression of each protein after transfection was confirmed by Western blot analysis and, in some cases, by immunostaining. The mouse postnatal day 3 (P3) olfactory bulbs were dissected in a buffer (120 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm glucose and 20 mm Hepes (pH7.4)) and sliced into 200-μm sections using a tissue chopper (Campden Instruments). The tested protein-expressing cells or tissue slices were incubated in the CM containing indicated AP fusion proteins (0–20 nm) for 90 min at 4 °C. When tissue sections were incubated with Olfm1-AP or AP, normal rabbit IgG or anti-NgR1 polyclonal IgG were added to the incubation mixtures (0.005 μg of IgG/μl). When binding of different fusion proteins was compared, equal amounts of AP were added. The samples were washed four times with PBS, fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and washed twice with PBS. The endogenous AP was inactivated by incubation of the samples at 65 °C for 90 min. The cell-bound AP activity was detected with AP substrate mixture (INT/BCIP, Roche) in the staining buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2) for 12–48 h. The images of stained cells were obtained with a dissection microscope (Zeiss, STEMI SV-11). For quantitative analysis of the activity of cell-bound AP, 1-StepTM PNPP (Pierce) was added to the fixed cells, and the absorbance at 405 nm in the supernatant was measured using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, model 680). Cultured cells or isolated tissues were homogenized in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) by repeated pipetting on ice. Following centrifugation, the soluble fraction was collected, and 5–15 μg of extracted proteins was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen). A membrane was incubated with anti-Olfm1 (1:5,000 dilution) or anti-FLAG (M2) (1:1,000 dilution, Sigma) antibodies, followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to HRP (1:10,000 dilution, Amersham Biosciences). The HRP signals were detected using a chemiluminescence detection kit (SuperSignal Femto Dura extended duration substrate, Pierce). For coimmunoprecipitation, protein A-agarose beads (Roche) were blocked with 0.05% (w/v) BSA (Sigma) for 1 h, incubated with anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (0.5 μg/sample, Sigma) for 1 h, and washed with the lysis buffer. The cell lysate was incubated with unbound beads for 1 h to preclear the sample and then with the antibody-bound beads overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads were precipitated and washed five times with the lysis buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Mouse embryos and tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. For frozen sectioning, fixed tissues were equilibrated in 20% sucrose, embedded into O.C.T. compound (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and 10-μm frozen sections were prepared. Cultured PC12 cells were seeded on coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences) coated with poly-D-lysine or rat tail collagen I, induced for the differentiation by nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml) for 3 days, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Slides with frozen sections or coverslips with cultured cells were blocked in a blocking buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% normal horse serum, and 1% BSA) and then incubated with the same blocking buffer with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies used were anti-Olfm1 (1:100 dilution), anti-NgR1 (1:50 dilution, Alomone Laboratory), and anti-EGFP (1:2,000 dilution, Aves Labs, Inc.). Slides were washed in PBS and then incubated in a buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA) with Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-chicken IgG (1:400 dilution, Invitrogen) and DAPI for nuclear staining. Images were collected using a confocal laser microscope (LSM 700, Carl Zeiss, Inc.) or an Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). The dissected adult mouse DRG were cultured on chambered coverslips coated with laminin and poly-D-lysine (BD Biosciences) with Neurobasal A medium, 1 × ITS and 16 ng/ml nerve growth factor. DRG were grown for 2 days with daily medium change and then treated with MAG-Fc (80 nm, R&D Systems) for 30 min with or without Olfm1 (7 nm) pretreatment for 10 min. Cells were immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (Invitrogen). The stained growth cones were observed using a fluorescence microscope, and images were recorded. The shape and area of all growth cones in the image were analyzed by ImageJ software. Growth cones larger than 10 μm2 with well spread filopodia were counted as healthy growth cones. RhoA GTP was measured using Rhotekin RDB-agarose (Millipore) and following the protocol of the company. Briefly, cells were homogenized in Mg2+ lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation for 15 min, the supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were measured. Samples were adjusted to the same protein concentration, mixed with Rhotekin-RDB-conjugated agarose beads on a rotator for 45 min at 4 °C, and beads were washed three times with the Mg2+ lysis buffer. The amounts of bound active RhoA and total RhoA in the initial cell lysates were estimated by Western blot analysis with anti-RhoA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). For active RhoA GTP measurements in the DRG growth cones, samples were stained with anti-active RhoA-GTP (New East Biosciences, 1:500 dilution), anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (1:400 dilution), and rhodamine-phalloidin. Images at the growth cones before collapse (average area > 30 μm2) were captured with a confocal laser microscope, and the intensity of RhoA GTP signal at each growth cone was quantitated by ImageJ software. The antisense MOs were designed and produced by Gene Tools LLC (Philomath, OR). The sequences of MOs used in this work were as follows: Control-MO, 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′; Olfm1-MO, 5′-AGCAAAGGCACCGACATCTCTGCTC-3′; and Missense-MO, 5′-AGGAAACGCACCCACATGTCTCCTC-3′. The MOs were dissolved in distilled water, mixed with 2 × injection buffer (0.05% phenol red, 240 mm KCl, and 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) and injected into egg yolk of 1- to 4-cell-stage embryos with a pneumatic PicoPump (PV820, World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL). Inserts of cDNA clones CO250150 and BC076103 encoding the full-length AMZ form of zebrafish olfm1b and ngr1 obtained from Open Biosystems were subcloned into the pCS2+ vector. RNAs were synthesized using an mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion) and different pCS2 constructs as templates. Synthesized RNAs (12.5–25 pg) were injected into one-cell stage embryos. 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) injection was performed using the method described previously (21Yoda H. Hirose Y. Yasuoka A. Sasado T. Morinaga C. Deguchi T. Henrich T. Iwanami N. Watanabe T. Osakada M. Kunimatsu S. Wittbrodt J. Suwa H. Niwa K. Okamoto Y. Yamanaka T. Kondoh H. Furutani-Seiki M. Mutations affecting retinotectal axonal pathfinding in Medaka (Oryzias latipes).Mech. Dev. 2004; 121: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and placed in 1.2% low-melting agarose. DiI (0.5 nl, 75 mg/ml) was injected into two positions diagonal to each other (nasodorsal and temporovental) in the left eye. The embryos were incubated at 28 °C overnight, and the projection of the optic nerve stained with DiI was observed and photographed using a dissection fluorescence microscope (Stemi SV11, Zeiss). The diameter of the optic nerves was measured and calculated using National Institutes of Health Image software. Data were analyzed using unpaired Student's t test preceded by F test for variances. Because there are no known receptor or membrane targets for secreted Olfm1, we screened for such molecules in a series of binding experiments using different forms of Olfm1 (Fig. 1A) and a vari"
https://openalex.org/W2164349269,"We have recently identified nc886 (pre-miR-886 or vtRNA2-1) as a novel type of non-coding RNA that inhibits activation of protein kinase R (PKR). PKR's pro-apoptotic role through eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α (eIF2α) phosphorylation is well established in the host defense against viral infection. Paradoxically, some cancer patients have elevated PKR activity; however, its cause and consequence are not understood. Initially, we evaluated the expression of nc886, PKR and eIF2α in non-malignant cholangiocyte and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells. nc886 is repressed in CCA cells and this repression is the cause of PKR's activation therein. nc886 alone is necessary and sufficient for suppression of PKR via direct physical interaction. Consistently, artificial suppression of nc886 in cholangiocyte cells activates the canonical PKR/eIF2α cell death pathway, suggesting a potential significance of the nc886 suppression and the consequent PKR activation in eliminating pre-malignant cells during tumorigenesis. In comparison, active PKR in CCA cells does not induce phospho-eIF2α nor apoptosis, but promotes the pro-survival nuclear factor-κB pathway. Thus, PKR has a dual life or death role during tumorigenesis. Similarly to the CCA cell lines, nc886 tends to be decreased but PKR tends to be activated in our clinical samples from CCA patients. Collectively from our data, we propose a tumor surveillance model for nc886's role in the PKR pathway during tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2058169262,"An interarm systolic blood pressure (SBP) difference of 10 mmHg or more have been associated with peripheral artery disease and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We investigated whether an association exists between this difference and ankle-brachial index (ABI), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and echocardiographic parameters. A total of 1120 patients were included in the study. The bilateral arm blood pressures were measured simultaneously by an ABI-form device. The values of ABI and baPWV were also obtained from the same device. Clinical data, ABI<0.9, baPWV, echocariographic parameters, and an interarm SBP difference ≥10 mmHg were compared and analyzed. We performed two multivariate forward analyses for determining the factors associated with an interarm SBP difference ≥10 mmHg [model 1: significant variables in univariate analysis except left ventricular mass index (LVMI); model 2: significant variables in univariate analysis except ABI<0.9 and baPWV]. The ABI<0.9 and high baPWV in model 1 and high LVMI in model 2 were independently associated with an interarm SBP difference ≥10 mmHg. Female, hypertension, and high body mass index were also associated with an interarm SBP difference ≥10 mmHg. Our study demonstrated that ABI<0.9, high baPWV, and high LVMI were independently associated with an interarm SBP difference of 10 mmHg or more. Detection of an interarm SBP difference may provide a simple method of detecting patients at increased risk of atherosclerosis and left ventricular hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2146220224,"Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF(165)) are potent pro-angiogenic growth factors that play a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis. The activity of these growth factors is regulated by heparan sulfate (HS), which is essential for the formation of FGF2/FGF receptor (FGFR) and VEGF(165)/VEGF receptor signaling complexes. However, the structural characteristics of HS that determine activation or inhibition of such complexes are only partially defined. Here we show that ovarian tumor endothelium displays high levels of HS sequences that harbor glucosamine 6-O-sulfates when compared with normal ovarian vasculature where these sequences are also detected in perivascular area. Reduced HS 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS6ST-1) or 6-O-sulfotransferase 2 (HS6ST-2) expression in endothelial cells impacts upon the prevalence of HS 6-O-sulfate moieties in HS sequences, which consist of repeating short, highly sulfated S domains interspersed by transitional N-acetylated/N-sulfated domains. 1-40% reduction in 6-O-sulfates significantly compromises FGF2- and VEGF(165)-induced endothelial cell sprouting and tube formation in vitro and FGF2-dependent angiogenesis in vivo. Moreover, HS on wild-type neighboring endothelial or smooth muscle cells fails to restore endothelial cell sprouting and tube formation. The affinity of FGF2 for HS with reduced 6-O-sulfation is preserved, although FGFR1 activation is inhibited correlating with reduced receptor internalization. These data show that 6-O-sulfate moieties in endothelial HS are of major importance in regulating FGF2- and VEGF(165)-dependent endothelial cell functions in vitro and in vivo and highlight HS6ST-1 and HS6ST-2 as potential targets of novel antiangiogenic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2023542693,"The RAF proteins are cytosolic protein kinases that regulate cell responses to extracellular signals. There are three RAF proteins in cells, ARAF, BRAF and CRAF, and recent studies have shown that the formation of complexes by these different isoforms has an important role in their activation, particularly in response to RAF inhibitors. Here, we investigated the role of ARAF in cancer cell signaling and examined the role of ARAF in mediating paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in cells treated with RAF inhibitors. We show that two mutations that occur in ARAF in cancer inactivate the kinase. We also show that ARAF is not functionally redundant with CRAF and cannot substitute for CRAF downstream of RAS. We further show that ARAF binds to and is activated by BRAF and that ARAF also forms complexes with CRAF. Critically, ARAF seems to stabilize BRAF:CRAF complexes in cells treated with RAF inhibitors and thereby regulate cell signaling in a subtle manner to ensure signaling efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2075867957,"Mixed lineage leukemias (MLLs) are human histone H3 lysine-4-specific methyl transferases that have critical roles in gene expression, epigenetics and cancer. Herein, we demonstrated that antisense-mediated knockdown of MLL1 induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in cultured cells. Intriguingly, application of MLL1 antisense specifically knocked down MLL1 in vivo and suppressed the growth of xenografted cervical tumor implanted in nude mouse. MLL1 knockdown downregulated various growth and angiogenic factors, such as HIF1α, VEGF and CD31, in tumor tissue affecting tumor growth. MLL1 is overexpressed along the line of vascular network and localized adjacent to endothelial cell layer expressing CD31, indicating potential roles of MLL1 in vasculogenesis. MLL1 is also overexpressed in the hypoxic regions along with HIF1α. Overall, our studies demonstrated that MLL1 is a key factor in hypoxia signaling, vasculogenesis and tumor growth, and its depletion suppresses tumor growth in vivo, indicating its potential in novel cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2165721913,"Multidrug resistance(MDR)is one of the major reasons for failure in cancer chemotherapy and its suppression may increase the efficacy of therapy. The human multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene encodes the plasma membrane P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that pumps various anti-cancer agents out of the cancer cell. R-HepG2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells are doxorubicin induced P-gp over-expressed MDR sublines of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells and human uterine carcinoma MES-SA cells respectively. Herein, we observed that clitocine, a natural compound extracted from Leucopaxillus giganteus, presented similar cytotoxicity in multidrug resistant cell lines compared with their parental cell lines and significantly suppressed the expression of P-gp in R-HepG2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Further study showed that the clitocine increased the sensitivity and intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin in R-HepG2 cells accompanying down-regulated MDR1 mRNA level and promoter activity, indicating the reversal effect of MDR by clitocine. A 5′-serial truncation analysis of the MDR1 promoter defined a region from position −450 to −193 to be critical for clitocine suppression of MDR1. Mutation of a consensus NF-κB binding site in the defined region and overexpression of NF-κB p65 could offset the suppression effect of clitocine on MDR1 promoter. By immunohistochemistry, clitocine was confirmed to suppress the protein levels of both P-gp and NF-κB p65 in R-HepG2 cells and tumors. Clitocine also inhibited the expression of NF-κB p65 in MES-SA/Dx5. More importantly, clitocine could suppress the NF-κB activation even in presence of doxorubicin. Taken together; our results suggested that clitocine could reverse P-gp associated MDR via down-regulation of NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W2030277145,"A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) proteases are implicated in multiple diseases, but no drugs based on ADAM inhibition exist. Most of the ADAM inhibitors developed to date feature zinc-binding moieties that target the active site zinc, which leads to a lack of selectivity and off-target toxicity. We hypothesized that secondary binding site (exosite) inhibitors should provide a viable alternative to active site inhibitors. Potential exosites in ADAM structures have been reported, but no studies describing substrate features necessary for exosite interactions exist. Analysis of ADAM cognate substrates revealed that glycosylation is often present in the vicinity of the scissile bond. To study whether glycosylation plays a role in modulating ADAM activity, a tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) substrate with and without a glycan moiety attached was synthesized and characterized. Glycosylation enhanced ADAM8 and -17 activities and decreased ADAM10 activity. Metalloprotease (MMP) activity was unaffected by TNFα substrate glycosylation. High throughput screening assays were developed using glycosylated and non-glycosylated substrate, and positional scanning was conducted. A novel chemotype of ADAM17-selective probes was discovered from the TPIMS library (Houghten, R. A., Pinilla, C., Giulianotti, M. A., Appel, J. R., Dooley, C. T., Nefzi, A., Ostresh, J.

Med. 9, 118-122) that preferentially inhibited glycosylated substrate hydrolysis and spared ADAM10, MMP-8, and MMP-14. Kinetic studies revealed that ADAM17 inhibition occurred via a non-zinc-binding mechanism. Thus, modulation of proteolysis via glycosylation may be used for identifying novel, potentially exosite binding compounds. The newly described ADAM17 inhibitors represent research tools to investigate the role of ADAM17 in the progression of various diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2128032343,"IL-32α is known as a proinflammatory cytokine. However, several evidences implying its action in cells have been recently reported. In this study, we present for the first time that IL-32α plays an intracellular mediatory role in IL-6 production using constitutive expression systems for IL-32α in THP-1 cells. We show that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced increase in IL-6 production by IL-32α-expressing cells was higher than that by empty vector-expressing cells and that this increase occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Treatment with MAPK inhibitors did not diminish this effect of IL-32α, and NF-κB signaling activity was similar in the two cell lines. Because the augmenting effect of IL-32α was dependent on the PKC activator PMA, we tested various PKC inhibitors. The pan-PKC inhibitor Gö6850 and the PKCϵ inhibitor Ro-31-8220 abrogated the augmenting effect of IL-32α on IL-6 production, whereas the classical PKC inhibitor Gö6976 and the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin did not. In addition, IL-32α was co-immunoprecipitated with PMA-activated PKCϵ, and this interaction was totally inhibited by the PKCϵ inhibitor Ro-31-8220. PMA-induced enhancement of STAT3 phosphorylation was observed only in IL-32α-expressing cells, and this enhancement was inhibited by Ro-31-8220, but not by Gö6976. We demonstrate that IL-32α mediated STAT3 phosphorylation by forming a trimeric complex with PKCϵ and enhanced STAT3 localization onto the IL-6 promoter and thereby increased IL-6 expression. Thus, our data indicate that the intracellular interaction of IL-32α with PKCϵ and STAT3 promotes STAT3 binding to the IL-6 promoter by enforcing STAT3 phosphorylation, which results in increased production of IL-6.

Thus, our data indicate that the intracellular interaction of IL-32α with PKCϵ and STAT3 promotes STAT3 binding to the IL-6 promoter by enforcing STAT3 phosphorylation, which results in increased production of IL-6."
https://openalex.org/W2035334757,"Ezrin is a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin family (ERM) of adapter proteins that are localized at the interface between the cell membrane and the cortical actin cytoskeleton, and they regulate a variety of cellular functions. The structure representing a dormant and closed conformation of an ERM protein has previously been determined by x-ray crystallography. Here, using contrast variation small angle neutron scattering, we reveal the structural changes of the full-length ezrin upon binding to the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) and to F-actin. Ezrin binding to F-actin requires the simultaneous binding of ezrin to PIP(2). Once bound to F-actin, the opened ezrin forms more extensive contacts with F-actin than generally depicted, suggesting a possible role of ezrin in regulating the interfacial structure and dynamics between the cell membrane and the underlying actin cytoskeleton. In addition, using gel filtration, we find that the conformational opening of ezrin in response to PIP(2) binding is cooperative, but the cooperativity is disrupted by a phospho-mimic mutation S249D in the 4.1-ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domain of ezrin. Using surface plasmon resonance, we show that the S249D mutation weakens the binding affinity and changes the kinetics of 4.1-ERM to PIP(2) binding. The study provides the first structural view of the activated ezrin bound to PIP(2) and to F-actin."
https://openalex.org/W2144265794,"High genetic heterogeneity is an important characteristic of hepatitis C virus (HCV) that contributes to its ability to establish persistent infection. The hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) that includes the first 27 amino acid residues of the E2 envelope glycoprotein is the most variable region within the HCV polyprotein. HVR1 plays a major role in both HCV cell entry and immune evasion, but the respective contribution of specific amino acid residues is still unclear. Our mutagenesis analyses of HCV pseudoparticles and cell culture-derived HCV using the H77 isolate indicate that five residues at positions 14, 15, and 25-27 mediate binding of the E2 protein to the scavenger receptor class B, type I receptor, and any residue herein is indispensable for HCV cell entry. The region spanning positions 16-24 contains the sole neutralizing epitope and is dispensable for HCV entry, but it is involved in heparan binding. More importantly, this region is necessary for the enhancement of HCV entry by high density lipoprotein and interferes with virus neutralization by E2-neutralizing antibodies. Residues at positions 1-13 are also dispensable for HCV entry, but they can affect HCV infectivity by modulating binding of the envelope protein to scavenger receptor class B, type I. Mutations occurring at this site may confer resistance to HVR1 antibodies. These findings further our understanding about the mechanisms of HCV cell entry and the significance of HVR1 variation in HCV immune evasion. They have major implications for the development of HCV entry inhibitors and prophylactic vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2164513507,"The membrane skeleton plays a central role in maintaining the elasticity and stability of the erythrocyte membrane, two biophysical features critical for optimal functioning and survival of red cells. Many constituent proteins of the membrane skeleton are phosphorylated by various kinases, and phosphorylation of β-spectrin by casein kinase and of protein 4.1R by PKC has been documented to modulate erythrocyte membrane mechanical stability. In this study, we show that activation of endogenous PKA by cAMP decreases membrane mechanical stability and that this effect is mediated primarily by phosphorylation of dematin. Co-sedimentation assay showed that dematin facilitated interaction between spectrin and F-actin, and phosphorylation of dematin by PKA markedly diminished this activity. Quartz crystal microbalance measurement revealed that purified dematin specifically bound the tail region of the spectrin dimer in a saturable manner with a submicromolar affinity. Pulldown assay using recombinant spectrin fragments showed that dematin, but not phospho-dematin, bound to the tail region of the spectrin dimer. These findings imply that dematin contributes to the maintenance of erythrocyte membrane mechanical stability by facilitating spectrin-actin interaction and that phosphorylation of dematin by PKA can modulate these effects.

In this study, we have uncovered a novel functional role for dematin in regulating erythrocyte membrane function. The human erythrocyte undergoes extensive membrane deformations while maintaining its structural integrity during its 120-day life span in the circulation. The erythrocyte membrane skeleton plays a critical role in bestowing the biophysical characteristics of membrane deformability and mechanical stability necessary for the cell to undergo extensive deformations while surviving the rigors of circulatory shear stress (1Mohandas N.

The erythrocyte membrane skeleton is a two-dimensional network of α2β2-spectrin tetramers, which are connected to junctional complexes composed of short actin filaments (F-actin) and several actin-binding proteins, including protein 4.1R, adducin, dematin, tropomyosin, and tropomodulin. Protein 4.1R and adducin have been shown to facilitate the interaction between spectrin and F-actin (3Ungewickell E. Bennett P.M. Calvert R. Ohanian V. Gratzer W.B.

Regulation and post-translational modification of erythrocyte membrane and membrane-skeletal proteins.Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 244-292PubMed Google Scholar). Casein kinase phosphorylates β-spectrin, 4.1R, and dematin (11Cohen C.M. Gascard P. Regulation and post-translational modification of erythrocyte membrane and membrane-skeletal proteins.Semin.

Modulation of erythrocyte membrane mechanical function by protein 4.1 phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7581-7587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Similarly, PKA phosphorylates β-spectrin, dematin, adducin, and 4.1R, with dematin being the most preferred substrate (11Cohen C.M. Gascard P. Regulation and post-translational modification of erythrocyte membrane and membrane-skeletal proteins.Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 244-292PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of PKA phosphorylation on erythrocyte membrane mechanical properties remains to be defined. Dematin (band 4.9) was originally identified as a major membrane skeletal protein in human erythrocytes (14Siegel D.L. Branton D.

Dematin may exist as a trimer consisting of two isoforms of 48 and 52 kDa, with the latter isoform containing an additional 22 amino acids inserted by alternative splicing (14Siegel D.L. Branton D.

Partial purification and characterization of an actin-bundling protein, band 4.9, from human erythrocytes.J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Upon PKA phosphorylation, dematin loses actin-bundling activity, whereas the ability to bind F-actin is maintained (17Azim A.C. Knoll J.H. Beggs A.H. Chishti A.H.

Abolition of actin bundling by phosphorylation of human erythrocyte protein 4.9.Nature. 1988; 334: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the physiological function of dematin in erythrocytes remains elusive because the mature erythrocytes lack actin bundles. Recently, it has been demonstrated that deletion of the headpiece domain of dematin results in mild spherocytosis accompanied by hemolytic anemia and reduced erythrocyte membrane stability (10Khanna R. Chang S.H. Andrabi S. Azam M. Kim A. Rivera A. Brugnara C. Low P.S. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Headpiece domain of dematin is required for the stability of the erythrocyte membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 6637-6642Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the combined deletion of the dematin headpiece and β-adducin leads to a more severe phenotype (20Chen H. Khan A.A. Liu F. Gilligan D.M. Peters L.L. Messick J. Haschek-Hock W.M. Li X. Ostafin A.E. Chishti A.H.

Chem. 2007; 282: 4124-4135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Dematin has recently been shown to serve as an anchoring site for the membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayer via binding to glucose transporter-1 (21Khan A.A. Hanada T. Mohseni M. Jeong J.J. Zeng L. Gaetani M. Li D. Reed B.C. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H.

Chem. 2008; 283: 14600-14609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These findings imply an important role for dematin in erythrocyte membrane function. In this study, we explored the effect of PKA phosphorylation on erythrocyte membrane function, and in the process, we identified an important role for dematin in regulating mechanical stability by facilitating the interaction of spectrin with actin. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Non-muscle actin from human platelets was from Cytoskeleton. The catalytic subunit of PKA from bovine heart, cAMP, ATP, and calyculin A were from Sigma. Q Sepharose was from GE Healthcare. Anti-dematin mAb was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Blood was drawn from healthy human volunteers after obtaining informed consent and used within 4 days of collection. Blood was filtered using porous polyurethane filters (Immuguard III, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) to deplete white cells. PBS-washed erythrocytes were incubated in 4 volumes of hypotonic buffer (5 mm sodium Pi (pH 7.5), 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (100 Ci/mmol), and 2.4 mm MgCl2) for 10 min on ice with gentle stirring in the presence or absence of 100 μm cAMP and 0.2 μm calyculin A. Following the addition of 0.1 volume of 1.5 m NaCl, the red cell ghosts were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C to facilitate phosphorylation by endogenous PKA. The ghosts were then washed once with 20 volumes of 5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) and 5 mm KCl in the presence or absence of 0.05 μm calyculin A, followed by resealing using 150 mm NaCl at 37 °C for 45 min. Three μl of the ghosts prepared as described above were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. The intensities of various phosphorylated protein bands were analyzed by densitometric scanning. The derived values were normalized based on the copy number of each protein, i.e. β-spectrin, 240,000; adducin, 60,000; 4.1R, 200,000; and dematin, 40,000 trimers (22Gallagher P.G. Forget B.G. Williams Hematology. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division, New York2010Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylation was carried out as described above except that nonradioactive ATP was used instead of [γ-32P]ATP. Membrane mechanical stability was quantified using an ektacytometer as described previously (23Mohandas N. Clark M.R. Health B.P. Rossi M. Wolfe L.C. Lux S.E. Shohet S.B. A technique to detect reduced mechanical stability of red cell membranes: relevance to elliptocytic disorders.Blood. 1982; 59: 768-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The mean T90 values, the time required for the deformability index (DI) 2The abbreviation used is: DIdeformability index. to reach 90% of DImax, were obtained from five independent experiments and compared with that of the untreated control. deformability index. Dematin was purified from human erythrocyte ghosts as described previously (14Siegel D.L. Branton D. Partial purification and characterization of an actin-bundling protein, band 4.9, from human erythrocytes.J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, band 6-depleted white ghosts were treated with 9 volumes of 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in buffer A (5 mm sodium Pi (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA) in the presence of 0.8 mm PMSF for 20 min on ice and centrifuged for 25 min at 40,000 × g. The pellet was washed once with buffer A with Triton X-100 and then once with buffer A without Triton X-100. The resulting Triton X-100 shells were incubated in 10 volumes of 3 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.8 mm PMSF for 45 min at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 3 h. The supernatant was loaded onto a Q Sepharose column (2.5 (inner diameter) × 29 cm) and eluted with a linear gradient of 20–300 mm KCl in buffer B (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.8 mm PMSF). The fractions containing dematin were mixed and diluted with buffer B to reduce the concentration of KCl to <100 mm. The diluted sample was reloaded onto the same Q Sepharose column and eluted with a linear gradient of 150–300 mm KCl in buffer B. The fractions containing dematin were mixed and diluted as described above and loaded onto a different Q Sepharose column (2.5 (inner diameter) × 3 cm). Pure dematin was obtained by elution with 200 mm KCl in buffer B. Purified dematin was dialyzed against sedimentation buffer (10 mm sodium Pi (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, and 0.8 mm PMSF) and mixed with 1 mm ATP, 2.4 mm MgCl2, and 100 units/ml bovine PKA catalytic subunit. The mixture was incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C, followed by inactivation of PKA at 68 °C for 5 min. Because Ser381 (corresponding to Ser403 in the 52-kDa isoform) was shown to be a PKA phosphorylation site (17Azim A.C. Knoll J.H. Beggs A.H. Chishti A.H. Isoform cloning, actin binding, and chromosomal localization of human erythroid dematin, a member of the villin superfamily.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17407-17413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), an antibody against phospho-dematin was generated by immunization of rabbits with the synthetic peptide CNELKKKA(pS)LF, corresponding to Asn396–Phe405 of human dematin (52-kDa isoform), conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an N-terminally added Cys residue. The serum from immunized rabbits was collected and characterized for the specificity of the antibody generated. Spectrin was purified from human erythrocytes as described previously (24Correas I. Leto T.L. Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. Identification of the functional site of erythrocyte protein 4.1 involved in spectrin-actin associations.J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3310-3315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Non-muscle actin (5 mg/ml) from human platelets was polymerized in 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm EGTA for 30 min at room temperature. Spectrin (1.13 μm) and F-actin (9.3 μm) were incubated on ice for 1 h in sedimentation buffer with either dematin or phospho-dematin (0–0.6 μm). The mixture was centrifuged through a 10% sucrose cushion at 195,000 × g for 30 min at 2 °C. The pellet was rinsed once with the same sucrose solution and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The amount of spectrin co-sedimenting with F-actin was quantitated by densitometric analysis of the gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In another series of experiments, spectrin, F-actin, and unphosphorylated dematin were mixed and incubated on ice for 1 h. At the end of the incubation period, the reaction mixture was divided into two aliquots: 1 mm ATP and 2.4 mm MgCl2 were added to one aliquot, whereas 1 mm ATP and 2.4 mm MgCl2 along with 133 units/ml bovine PKA catalytic subunit were added to the second aliquot. Following incubation at 37 °C for 1.5 h, the samples were centrifuged through the same sucrose cushion and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Constructs pGEX-βN-2 (N-terminal actin-binding domain and repeats 1 and 2 of human βI-spectrin, amino acid residues 1–527) and pET-α20-C (repeats 20 and 21 and C-terminal EF-domain of human αI-spectrin, amino acid residues 2044–2419) were generous gifts from Dr. Xiuli An (New York Blood Center). α20-C was subcloned into pGEX-6P-3 at the EcoRI and XhoI sites (pGEX-α20-C). The plasmids were introduced into BL21 Star(DE3)pLysS cells. After induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the bacterial pellet was lysed in TBS (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.05% Tween 20 in the presence of Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) by sonication. GST fusion proteins were collected using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. In brief, following elution from glutathione-Sepharose beads, GST-βN-2 was digested with thrombin. The mixture of digested GST and βN-2 was mixed and incubated with GST-α20-C on ice for 1 h in sedimentation buffer and separated on prepacked Sephacryl S-200 at 0.2 ml/min. Fractions (2 ml) were collected. Fractions with equimolar amounts of GST-α20-C and βN-2 (mini-spectrin) determined on SDS-PAGE were pooled and used for binding assay. Recombinant mini-spectrin dimer immobilized on glutathione beads was mixed with increasing concentrations of dematin and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in sedimentation buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-dematin mAb and IRDye 800CW-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (LI-COR Biosciences). Near-infrared fluorescence was detected and quantified using Odyssey (LI-COR Biosciences). Serial dilution of purified dematin quantified in parallel gave a linear standard curve over the entire range of concentrations used in the study. Similarly, pulldown assay was performed for phospho-dematin. Phospho-dematin was detected using ECL (Pierce). Purified dematin (ligand) was immobilized on a gold sensor chip, and binding of the mini-spectrin dimer prepared as described above (analyte) was monitored in PBS using Single Q 0500 (As One Corp., Tokyo, Japan), a quartz crystal microbalance device. Curve fitting and calculation of the dissociation constant (KD) and the Hill coefficient were conducted using SigmaPlot Version 11.2 (Systat Software). Dematin or phospho-dematin (0–0.4 μm) and F-actin (11.6 μm) in sedimentation buffer were incubated on ice for 1 h and subjected to centrifugation through a 10% sucrose cushion in the same buffer. The protein pellet was resolved on SDS gel, followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-dematin monoclonal antibody. The amount of dematin or phospho-dematin co-sedimenting with F-actin was quantitated by densitometric analysis. Activation of endogenous PKA by cAMP in the presence of calyculin A, a phosphatase inhibitor, showed a marked increase in phosphorylation of dematin and also of protein 4.1R but to a much lesser extent (Fig. 1, A and B). This observation is in agreement with findings from earlier studies (11Cohen C.M. Gascard P. Regulation and post-translational modification of erythrocyte membrane and membrane-skeletal proteins.Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 244-292PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A alone, increased phosphorylation of β-spectrin and dematin, but not of adducin and 4.1R, over the basal levels was observed (Fig. 1B). However, in contrast to dematin, cAMP caused no further increases in phosphorylation of either β-spectrin or adducin. These findings clearly show that of all erythrocyte membrane skeletal proteins, dematin in situ is the preferred substrate for PKA. Measurement of membrane mechanical stability of ghosts prepared from PKA-activated erythrocytes showed a more rapid rate of decrease in DI at a constant value of applied shear stress compared with that of control ghosts, implying decreased membrane mechanical stability (Fig. 1C). Calyculin A treatment alone also resulted in measurable but a lesser extent of decreased membrane mechanical stability compared with control ghosts. The membrane mechanical stability (T90; see “Experimental Procedures”) following activation of PKA was decreased by 31.1 ± 8.2% compared with the control, whereas following treatment with calyculin A alone, the decrease was only 10 ± 8.6% (Fig. 1D). These findings imply that PKA phosphorylation of dematin decreases membrane mechanical stability. As membrane mechanical stability is regulated primarily by lateral interactions of the protein components of the membrane skeleton, i.e. spectrin-actin interaction and spectrin-spectrin interaction, perturbation of either or both of these two specific protein-protein interactions by PKA phosphorylation could account for decreased membrane mechanical stability. As dematin has previously been shown to be a constituent of the spectrin-actin junctional complex, we explored the consequences of dematin phosphorylation on its ability to modulate the interaction between spectrin and actin. Dematin was purified from erythrocytes to >95% purity as determined by densitometric scanning of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel (Fig. 2A). An anti-dematin monoclonal antibody recognized both unphosphorylated and in vitro phosphorylated dematin with equal efficiency (Fig. 2B, upper panel). In contrast, a rabbit anti-phospho-dematin polyclonal antibody raised against the synthetic peptide CNELKKKA(pS)403LF specifically recognized only the phosphorylated dematin (Fig. 2B, middle panel). This polyclonal antibody also recognized dematin that was phosphorylated in situ on the membrane (Fig. 2B, lower panel), documenting that Ser403 is phosphorylated by PKA in situ as well as in vitro. Note that phospho-dematin showed lower mobility on SDS gels probably due to the addition of a phosphate group. Hence, phosphorylation of dematin could be monitored by the mobility shift using anti-dematin monoclonal antibody. Co-sedimentation assay performed using purified spectrin and actin showed that spectrin interacts with F-actin weakly (Fig. 2C, upper panel, lane 3) as reported previously (13Manno S. Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. Modulation of erythrocyte membrane mechanical function by protein 4.1 phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7581-7587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the presence of dematin, the amount of spectrin co-sedimenting with F-actin was significantly increased, implying that dematin facilitates spectrin-actin interaction (Fig. 2C, upper panel, lane 4, and Fig. 2D). In marked contrast, the ability of phosphorylated dematin to enhance interaction between spectrin and actin was markedly compromised (Fig. 2C, upper panel, lane 5, and Fig. 2D). The mobility shift of phospho-dematin gave assurance that the dematin used in the co-sedimentation assay was indeed phosphorylated (Fig. 2C, lower panel, lanes 4 and 5). Use of increasing concentrations of dematin in the co-sedimentation assay resulted in increasing amounts of spectrin co-sedimenting with actin (Fig. 2E, lanes 2–5, and Fig. 2F). In marked contrast, increasing concentrations of phospho-dematin failed to enhance spectrin-actin interaction (Fig. 2E, lanes 6–9, and Fig. 2F). Note also that although increasing amounts of dematin were found in the pellet, much reduced amounts of phospho-dematin co-sedimented with spectrin and actin (Fig. 2E, lower panel). The effect of dematin phosphorylation on the interaction between spectrin and F-actin was tested in a preformed spectrin-actin-dematin complex. The ability of dematin to facilitate and maintain spectrin-actin interaction in the preformed complex was sustained during incubation at 37 °C for an additional 1.5 h (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4). In marked contrast, when the preformed complex was incubated in the presence of PKA, dematin was phosphorylated, and both spectrin and dematin dissociated from F-actin (Fig. 3A, lane 5). These results clearly demonstrate that dematin facilitates spectrin-actin interaction, and PKA phosphorylation of dematin markedly diminishes its ability to facilitate this interaction. Because PKA also phosphorylates spectrin (see Fig. 1A), the effect of PKA treatment on spectrin binding to F-actin was examined. No significant change in the amount of spectrin co-sedimenting with F-actin was observed following incubation of a preformed spectrin-actin complex with PKA at 37 °C for 1.5 h (Fig. 3B). The activity of PKA used in these experiments was confirmed by showing that the same PKA preparation phosphorylated purified dematin (data not shown). This finding enables us to conclude that dissociation of spectrin from the spectrin-F-actin-dematin complex is due to phosphorylation of dematin, but not of spectrin itself. To document direct interaction between dematin and spectrin, we performed pulldown assays using purified dematin and mini-spectrin dimers composed of α20-C and βN-2. Binding of dematin to mini-spectrin was documented using an anti-dematin mAb (Fig. 4A). With increasing concentrations of dematin, the amount of dematin pulled down by mini-spectrin increased (Fig. 4B), suggesting that dematin directly binds to mini-spectrin. In contrast, phospho-dematin failed to bind to mini-spectrin dimers (Fig. 4A). GST alone did not bind either dematin or phospho-dematin. To obtain quantitative assessment of the affinity of the interaction between dematin and spectrin, we used the quartz crystal microbalance measurement. As shown in Fig. 4C, the binding of the mini-spectrin dimer to immobilized dematin was saturable, demonstrating the specificity of the binding. A dissociation constant of 14.8 ± 1.6 nm was derived from the analysis of the binding profile. As the binding curve was sigmoidal, it appears that the spectrin dimer binds dematin in a positive cooperative manner (Hill coefficient = 1.75 ± 0.19). It is likely that this could be the result of the binding of the mini-spectrin dimer to the trimeric dematin immobilized on the sensor chip. These results enable us to document that dematin specifically binds to the tail region of the spectrin dimer, which facilitates the binding of the spectrin dimer to F-actin at the junctional complex. It is well established that dematin binds to F-actin, and the binding is affected by PKA phosphorylation (18Husain-Chishti A. Levin A. Branton D.

Cytoskeleton. 2002; 52: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We confirmed these earlier findings using the co-sedimentation assay by documenting a 70% reduction in the ability of dematin to bind F-actin upon phosphorylation by PKA (data not shown). These results are in very good agreement with earlier findings that showed that PKA phosphorylation reduces the binding affinity of dematin for F-actin by 3–5-fold (18Husain-Chishti A. Levin A. Branton D. Abolition of actin bundling by phosphorylation of human erythrocyte protein 4.9.Nature. 1988; 334: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Vardar D. Chishti A.H. Frank B.S.

Cytoskeleton. 2002; 52: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine the potential contribution of altered spectrin dimer-dimer interaction to the PKA-mediated decrease in membrane mechanical stability, we compared the dimer/tetramer ratio of spectrin extracted from PKA-activated erythrocytes to that from control cells. No differences were noted in the spectrin dimer/tetramer ratio between PKA-activated and control erythrocytes (data not shown), implying that altered spectrin-spectrin interaction does not contribute to PKA-mediated reduced membrane mechanical stability. The spectrin-actin junctional complex is a key structural feature of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, where the tail of the αβ-spectrin dimer binds to a short actin filament and where several skeletal proteins, including 4.1R, adducin, tropomyosin, tropomodulin, and dematin, are localized (1Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Red blood cell deformability, membrane material properties, and shape: regulation by transmembrane, skeletal, and cytosolic proteins and lipids.Semin.

A detailed understanding of the contribution of interactions among spectrin, actin, and 4.1R in the junctional complex to membrane mechanical function has been developed (2Mohandas N. Gallagher P.G.

Invest. 1986; 78: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of 4.1R by PKC and of β-spectrin by casein kinase has been shown to reduce membrane mechanical stability (12Manno S. Takakuwa Y. Nagao K. Mohandas N. Modulation of erythrocyte membrane mechanical function by β-spectrin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Manno S. Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. Modulation of erythrocyte membrane mechanical function by protein 4.1 phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7581-7587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory role of PKA phosphorylation and the contribution of dematin to red cell membrane mechanical function remain unclear. In this study, we documented that like 4.1R, dematin enhances the interaction of spectrin with actin and that phosphorylation of dematin by PKA reduces this enhancing ability. Importantly, we showed that phosphorylation of membrane skeletal proteins by PKA reduced membrane mechanical stability and that this effect was mediated primarily by phosphorylation of dematin. As there were subtle increases in phosphorylation of 4.1R and adducin following activation of PKA, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of the potential contribution of the phosphorylation of these two proteins to the observed decreases in membrane mechanical stability. However, our data strongly imply that dematin plays a key role in maintaining the functional integrity of the membrane skeleton via facilitating lateral interaction between spectrin and F-actin. Our data also show that treatment of red cells with calyculin A alone, a phosphatase inhibitor, resulted in a modest decrease in membrane mechanical stability. Increased phosphorylation of β-spectrin and dematin following treatment with calyculin A suggests that phosphorylation of dematin alone or in combination with phosphorylation of β-spectrin by cAMP-independent kinase modulates membrane mechanical stability. Casein kinase is one of the candidate kinases because we previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of β-spectrin by casein kinase decreases membrane mechanical stability (12Manno S. Takakuwa Y. Nagao K. Mohandas N. Modulation of erythrocyte membrane mechanical function by β-spectrin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Whether or not dematin phosphorylation by casein kinase affects membrane stability needs to be further explored. The original study characterizing erythrocyte dematin established it to be an actin-binding protein and stated that dematin does not bind spectrin (14Siegel D.L. Branton D. Partial purification and characterization of an actin-bundling protein, band 4.9, from human erythrocytes.J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, a subsequent study suggested binding of dematin to spectrin (16Rana A.P. Ruff P. Maalouf G.J. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Cloning of human erythroid dematin reveals another member of the villin family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 6651-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but this finding has largely been overlooked. In this study, we unambiguously demonstrated that dematin specifically binds to the tail region of spectrin with high affinity (on the order of 10−8 m). The apparent discrepant findings are likely due to the fact that the original study might have used purified phosphorylated dematin for binding studies (14Siegel D.L. Branton D. Partial purification and characterization of an actin-bundling protein, band 4.9, from human erythrocytes.J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and we have clearly shown that dematin loses its ability to bind spectrin upon phosphorylation. Further studies are needed to precisely determine the dematin-binding site on spectrin and the spectrin-binding site on dematin. It now appears that at least three distinct skeletal proteins are involved in reinforcing spectrin-actin interaction, i.e. 4.1R, adducin, and dematin. The fact that a number of different proteins play a redundant role emphasizes the importance of spectrin-actin interaction in erythrocyte physiology, especially in regulating membrane mechanical functions. It is interesting that the phosphorylation of these proteins by various kinases alters their ability to mediate spectrin-actin interaction. In solution, PKA phosphorylation has been shown to abolish the ability of adducin to enhance spectrin-actin binding (26Matsuoka Y. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. Adducin regulation. Definition of the calmodulin-binding domain and sites of phosphorylation by protein kinases A and C.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25157-25166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We have recently found that an adenosine receptor agonist induces an increase in intracellular cAMP levels and phosphorylation of adducin, showing that mature erythrocytes are able to respond to extracellular stimuli (27Kamata K. Manno S. Ozaki M. Takakuwa Y. Functional evidence for presence of lipid rafts in erythrocyte membranes: Gαs in rafts is essential for signal transduction.Am. J. Hematol. 2008; 83: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to examine if stimulation by physiological agonists induces PKA phosphorylation of dematin and/or adducin and hence affects erythrocyte membrane mechanical properties. Previously, we have shown that PKC phosphorylation of 4.1R decreases membrane mechanical stability (13Manno S. Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. Modulation of erythrocyte membrane mechanical function by protein 4.1 phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7581-7587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In that study, we surmised that phosphorylation of 4.1R is primarily responsible for the membrane instability and did not consider the effect of dematin because dematin had not been previously implicated in regulating membrane stability, though dematin is also a substrate for PKC. Given that dematin also facilitates spectrin-actin interaction, the effect of dematin phosphorylation by PKC on membrane stability needs to be further explored. We have previously demonstrated that the treatment of erythrocytes with lidocaine, an amphipathic local anesthetic, blocks agonist-induced increases in intracellular cAMP levels through disruption of lipid raft-mediated signal transduction (27Kamata K. Manno S. Ozaki M. Takakuwa Y. Functional evidence for presence of lipid rafts in erythrocyte membranes: Gαs in rafts is essential for signal transduction.Am. J. Hematol. 2008; 83: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We also reported that lidocaine treatment of erythrocytes inhibits invasion of erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum, a causative protozoan parasite of the most severe form of human malaria (28Koshino I. Takakuwa Y. Disruption of lipid rafts by lidocaine inhibits erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum.Exp. Parasitol. 2009; 123: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that increases or decreases in cAMP levels parallel increases or decreases in P. falciparum invasion of erythrocytes, respectively (29Harrison T. Samuel B.U. Akompong T. Hamm H. Mohandas N. Lomasney J.W. Haldar K. Erythrocyte G protein-coupled receptor signaling in malarial infection.Science. 2003; 301: 1734-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). During the invasion process, the P. falciparum merozoite invaginates the erythrocyte membrane and is enclosed within a vacuolar membrane, which is free of membrane skeletal proteins (19Lauer S. VanWye J. Harrison T. McManus H. Samuel B.U. Hiller N.L. Mohandas N. Haldar K. Vacuolar uptake of host components, and a role for cholesterol and sphingomyelin in malarial infection.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that the membrane skeleton is locally and transiently disrupted during invasion by cAMP-dependent mechanism(s). Based on our present findings, PKA phosphorylation of dematin might be involved in disruption of spectrin-actin interaction locally to facilitate efficient parasite invasion. Our findings have uncovered a novel function for dematin in regulating red cell membrane function, and we anticipate that future studies will unravel new insights into the role of dematin in erythrocyte physiology and pathology."

As a consequence, AdPLA-deficient mice are resistant to obesity induced by a high fat diet or leptin deficiency. It has been proposed that AdPLA mediates its antilipolytic effects by catalyzing the release of arachidonic acid. Based on sequence homology, AdPLA is part of a small family of acyltransferases and phospholipases related to lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT). To better understand the enzymatic mechanism of AdPLA and LRAT-related proteins, we solved the crystal structure of AdPLA. Our model indicates that AdPLA bears structural similarity to proteins from the NlpC/P60 family of cysteine proteases, having its secondary structure elements configured in a circular permutation of the classic papain fold. Using both structural and biochemical evidence, we demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of AdPLA is mediated by a distinctive Cys-His-His catalytic triad and that the C-terminal transmembrane domain of AdPLA is required for the interfacial catalysis. Analysis of the enzymatic activity of AdPLA toward synthetic and natural substrates indicates that AdPLA displays PLA1 in addition to PLA2 activity. Thus, our results provide insight into the enzymatic mechanism and biochemical properties of AdPLA and LRAT-related proteins and lead us to propose an alternate mechanism for AdPLA in promoting adipose tissue lipolysis that is not contingent on the release of arachidonic acid and that is compatible with its combined PLA1/A2 activity.

Adipose tissue plays an important role in the regulation of energy balance. Although most other tissues can hydrolyze triacylglycerols for their own use, adipose tissue alone can hydrolyze triacylglycerols to export glycerol and fatty acids for use by other tissues. The net rate of triacylglycerol hydrolysis in adipose tissue (or lipolysis) is a determinant of whole-body insulin sensitivity (1Coppack S.W. Jensen M.D. Miles J.M. In vivo regulation of lipolysis in humans.J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 177-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hence a potentially important therapeutic target in the treatment of obesity. Adipose tissue lipolysis proceeds through the sequential action of the triacylglycerol hydrolases, desnutrin/adipose triglyceride lipase (2Villena J.A. Roy S. Sarkadi-Nagy E. Kim K.H. Sul H.S.

Morishita J. Jin X.H. Okamoto Y. Tsuboi K. Ueda N. The tumor suppressor gene H-Rev107 functions as a novel Ca2+-independent cytosolic phospholipase A1/2 of the thiol hydrolase type.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 685-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The sequence and enzymatic activity of AdPLA resemble those of a small family of proteins related to lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT). All members of the LRAT family have been shown to catalyze PLA1, PLA2, or acyltransferase reactions (15Ruiz A. Winston A. Lim Y.H. Gilbert B.A. Rando R.R. Bok D.

Thus, the LRAT family could be appropriately described as a phospholipase A/acyltransferase family based on a recent proposal by Uyama et al. (19Uyama T. Ikematsu N. Inoue M. Shinohara N. Jin X.H. Tsuboi K. Tonai T. Tokumura A. Ueda N. Generation of N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine by members of the phospholipase A/acyltransferase (PLA/AT) family.J. Biol.

The inhibitory effect of AdPLA expression on adipose tissue lipolysis was proposed to be a result of the production of PGE2 through the release of arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of phospholipids (11Jaworski K.

AdPLA ablation increases lipolysis and prevents obesity induced by high-fat feeding or leptin deficiency.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the significant PLA1 activity of AdPLA led to suggestions that AdPLA might have other functions in controlling cellular metabolism and lipid accumulation in addition to production of free arachidonic acid (14Uyama T.

In one such example, overexpression of AdPLA in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (21Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. Characteristics of a human cell line transformed by DNA from human adenovirus type 5.J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar) leads to peroxisome dysfunction and a decrease in ether-linked triglycerides and plasmalogens (22Uyama T. Ichi I. Kono N. Inoue A.

Importantly, these effects were not accompanied by a significant release of arachidonic acid in such cells. AdPLA was originally identified as being specifically expressed in phenotypic revertants of H-ras-transformed cells; thus, it was characterized as a class II tumor suppressor (23Hajnal A. Klemenz R. Schäfer R. Subtraction cloning of H-rev107, a gene specifically expressed in H-ras resistant fibroblasts.Oncogene. 1994; 9: 479-490PubMed Google Scholar) and referred to as H-ras-revertant gene 107 (H-Rev107) or H-Ras-like suppressor 3 (HRASLS3). Expression of AdPLA is down-regulated in several tumor cell lines (24Husmann K. Sers C. Fietze E. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Schäfer R.

The relationship between the enzymatic activity and the tumor suppressive effect of AdPLA is not well understood. To gain a better understanding of the physiological role of AdPLA, we investigated its structure and enzymatic properties. Based on sequence analysis, members of the LRAT family were predicted to have a circular permutation of the catalytic domain found in members of the superfamily of proteins related to Escherichia coli NlpC and Listeria monocytogenes P60 proteins (NlpC/P60) (30Ishikawa S.

Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1354-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the case of LRAT and other LRAT family members, the Cys residue was shown to act as a nucleophile and form a covalent thiol-acyl intermediate in the catalytic process (20Golczak M. Kiser P.D. Sears A.E. Lodowski D.T. Blaner W.S. Palczewski K. Structural basis for the acyltransferase activity of lecithin:retinol acyltransferase-like proteins.J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29217-29222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A truncated fragment of AdPLA lacking the transmembrane domain was recently characterized by a solution NMR structure (35Ren X. Lin J. Jin C. Xia B. Solution structure of the N-terminal catalytic domain of human H-REV107—a novel circular permutated NlpC/P60 domain.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 4222-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (20Golczak M.

Both structures show that AdPLA conforms to the permuted papain domain fold seen in a subset of NlpC/P60 proteins and predict the location of residues potentially involved in the catalytic triad of AdPLA. Herein, we further describe the enzymatic mechanism of AdPLA by presenting a novel crystal structure of AdPLA that provides additional support for its enzymatic mechanism. We describe the expression and purification of a soluble full-length form of AdPLA that displays robust enzymatic activity, and we examine the PLA1/PLA2 specificity of AdPLA for various natural phospholipid substrates. We provide experimental support for the role of the residues proposed to be involved in the catalytic mechanism, and we probe the structural dynamic difference between full-length and truncated AdPLA based on hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments coupled to mass spectrometry (DXMS). Finally, we evaluate the possible role of AdPLA in the generation of arachidonic acid in adipose tissue in light of its activity and substrate preference. We cloned human AdPLA cDNA from a full-length expressed sequence tag clone available from the Open Biosystems Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) (MGC: 118754, IMAGE: 40000132). A truncation of human AdPLA (T-AdPLA) retaining amino acid residues 1–134 was amplified and cloned through ligation-independent cloning in the vector pTB-MalE (36Qin H. Hu J. Hua Y. Challa S.V. Cross T.A. Gao F.P. Construction of a series of vectors for high throughput cloning and expression screening of membrane proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.BMC Biotechnol. 2008; 8: 51Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) digested with SspI. The ligation places T-AdPLA downstream of an N-terminal fusion partner consisting of a hexahistidine-tagged maltose-binding protein (MBP) and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. Alternatively, the full-length AdPLA (FL-AdPLA) cDNA was cloned in-frame with MBP and separated by a TEV cleavage site to generate a construct coding for an MBP-FL-AdPLA fusion protein. Mutagenesis of the MBP-FL-AdPLA protein was performed using a QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The expression constructs were sequenced and transformed in Bl21(DE3) E. coli and grown in Terrific Broth under the selection of 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The primers used for cloning T-AdPLA and FL-AdPLA and for site-directed mutagenesis reactions of MBP-FL-AdPLA are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The sequence of the expressed MBP-T-AdPLA and MBP-FL-AdPLA proteins are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Protein expression was induced using the Overnight Express Autoinduction System (EMD Millipore-Merck KGaA, Billerica, MA) based on a method described previously (37Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4127) Google Scholar). The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 25 units/ml Benzonase (EMD Millipore), 50 mm arginine and lysed either by two passages in a French press or through sonication at 50% amplitude for 6 × 20 s. The lysate was spun by centrifugation at 19,000 rpm for 30 min to pellet membranes and insoluble complexes and then filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. Purification of MBP-FL-AdPLA or MBP-T-AdPLA fusion proteins was carried out by metal affinity chromatography. The bacterial supernatant was loaded onto tandem 5-ml His Trap HP columns (GE Healthcare) in conjunction with an ÄKTA Xpress purification system at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The columns were washed with Buffer A (0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) over 4 column volumes. Another wash with 5% Buffer B (500 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) was used to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Elution was carried out with Buffer B in a linear gradient from 5 to 100%. The resulting fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE, and the protein-containing fractions were pooled and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. The protein solution was concentrated and desalted using a Spin-X UF centrifugal concentrator (20 ml; 5,000 molecular weight cutoff; Corning Inc. Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA) to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. MBP-FL-AdPLA or MBP-T-AdPLA fusion proteins were next purified by anion exchange chromatography using tandem 5-ml HiTrap Q HP columns (GE Healthcare). The column was washed using Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl) over 4 column volumes followed by a wash with 10% Buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.0 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Elution was carried out with Buffer B in a linear gradient from 10 to 100% at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the protein-containing fractions were pooled and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. Cleavage with TEV to remove the MBP fusion was performed using 30 mg of MBP-T-AdPLA protein in 30 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol supplemented with 600 μg of hexahistidine-tagged TurboTEV (2 mg/ml stock; 10,000 units/mg; Nacalai USA, San Diego, CA) for 48 h at 20 °C with gentle shaking. The hexahistidine-tagged MBP and TurboTEV proteins were removed by metal affinity chromatography using 2 ml of HisPur nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Fisher Scientific) in sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The eluted untagged T-AdPLA protein was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and concentrated to 4 ml using a Spin-X UF centrifugal concentrator (20 ml; 5,000 molecular weight cutoff; Corning Inc. Life Sciences) and purified by using size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 prep grade column equilibrated with a buffer of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and eluted at 0.8 ml/min over 2.5 column volumes. The T-AdPLA-containing fractions were pooled, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter, and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. The resulting untagged T-AdPLA protein is stable at 4 °C for more than 4 weeks. To verify the identity of the purified protein, the recombinant T-AdPLA protein was examined by SDS-PAGE. The purified protein migrated as a single band as identified by Coomassie Blue staining. The protein band was cut from the gel and treated with iodoacetamide to amidate the Cys residues and digested in-gel with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. Analysis of the tryptic fragments by tandem MS/MS identified the purified protein as AdPLA showing 90% peptide coverage of the T-AdP"
https://openalex.org/W1990818258,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that belong to the Cys-loop receptor superfamily. These receptors are allosteric proteins that exist in different conformational states, including resting (closed), activated (open), and desensitized (closed) states. The acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) is a structural homologue of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of nAChRs. In previous studies, the degree of the C-loop radial extension of AChBP has been assigned to different conformational states of nAChRs. It has been suggested that a closed C-loop is preferred for the active conformation of nAChRs in complex with agonists whereas an open C-loop reflects an antagonist-bound (closed) state. In this work, we have determined the crystal structure of AChBP from the water snail Lymnaea stagnalis (Ls) in complex with dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE), which is a potent competitive antagonist of nAChRs. The structure reveals that binding of DHβE to AChBP imposes closure of the C-loop as agonists, but also a shift perpendicular to previously observed C-loop movements. These observations suggest that DHβE may antagonize the receptor via a different mechanism compared to prototypical antagonists and toxins."

Due to its fragile structure, skin can be easily damaged by heat, chemicals, traumatic injuries and diseases. An autologous bilayered human skin equivalent, MyDerm™, was engineered to provide a living skin substitute to treat critical skin loss. However, one of the disadvantages of living skin substitute is its short shelf-life, hence limiting its distribution worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the shelf-life of MyDerm™ through assessment of cell morphology, cell viability, population doubling time and functional gene expression levels before transplantation. Skin samples were digested with 0.6% Collagenase Type I followed by epithelial cells dissociation with TrypLE Select. Dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes were culture-expanded to obtain sufficient cells for MyDerm™ construction. MyDerm™ was constructed with plasma-fibrin as temporary biomaterial and evaluated at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours after storage at 4°C for its shelf-life determination. The morphology of skin cells derived from MyDerm™ remained unchanged across storage times. Cells harvested from MyDerm™ after storage appeared in good viability (90.5%±2.7% to 94.9%±1.6%) and had short population doubling time (58.4±8.7 to 76.9±19 hours). The modest drop in cell viability and increased in population doubling time at longer storage duration did not demonstrate a significant difference. Gene expression for CK10, CK14 and COL III were also comparable between different storage times. In conclusion, MyDerm™ can be stored in basal medium at 4°C for at least 72 hours before transplantation without compromising its functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2044787526,"Background There is a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in women of reproductive age. Methods This work studied the first two generations of offspring (F1 and F2) of Swiss mice from mothers fed one of two diets: SC (standard chow) or VitD- (vitamin D-deficient). Functional and developmental kidney measurements were taken. Results The first two generations of the VitD- group had higher blood pressure at 6 months of age than the offspring of the SC group as well as an increase in renin and AT1r expression. However, at all ages, both F1 and F2 VitD- mice had shorter glomerular diameters, and diet played a significant role in the total variation. Both the F1 and F2 generations of the VitD- group had more immature glomeruli than offspring from the SC group. Immature glomeruli begin to disappear at 10 days, but at this age, F1-VitD- mice had more immature and mature glomeruli than F1-SC mice. At 6 months of age, F1-VitD- mice exhibited more glomeruli, while F2-VitD- mice exhibited the same number of glomeruli as F2-SC mice, but fewer glomeruli compared to the F1-VitD group. Both diet and generation account for the total variation in the number of glomeruli. Decreases in urine output and podocin expression and increases in urea and creatinine in the urine were observed in F1 offspring. Conclusion These findings demonstrate that maternal vitamin D deficiency accompanies changes in the renal expression of important factors that may retard the maturation of glomeruli by extending the period of nephrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1972166243,"Metagenomic studies use high-throughput sequence data to investigate microbial communities in situ. However, considerable challenges remain in the analysis of these data, particularly with regard to speed and reliable analysis of microbial species as opposed to higher level taxa such as phyla. We here present Genometa, a computationally undemanding graphical user interface program that enables identification of bacterial species and gene content from datasets generated by inexpensive high-throughput short read sequencing technologies. Our approach was first verified on two simulated metagenomic short read datasets, detecting 100% and 94% of the bacterial species included with few false positives or false negatives. Subsequent comparative benchmarking analysis against three popular metagenomic algorithms on an Illumina human gut dataset revealed Genometa to attribute the most reads to bacteria at species level (i.e. including all strains of that species) and demonstrate similar or better accuracy than the other programs. Lastly, speed was demonstrated to be many times that of BLAST due to the use of modern short read aligners. Our method is highly accurate if bacteria in the sample are represented by genomes in the reference sequence but cannot find species absent from the reference. This method is one of the most user-friendly and resource efficient approaches and is thus feasible for rapidly analysing millions of short reads on a personal computer.The Genometa program, a step by step tutorial and Java source code are freely available from http://genomics1.mh-hannover.de/genometa/ and on http://code.google.com/p/genometa/.

https://openalex.org/W2007507588,"Persistent activation of the Abl tyrosine kinase in the BCR-ABL fusion protein is the major cause of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Among many other substrates BCR-ABL phosphorylates STAT5 and Src family kinases (SFK). Activated pSTAT5 is essential for initial transformation and maintenance of the disease. Cytokine-induced phosphorylation on tyrosine 694 typically leads to nuclear accumulation of pSTAT5 and target gene expression. We verified that in BCR-ABL-positive progenitor cells from a CML patient and in K562 cells pSTAT5 is cytoplasmic. However, upon ectopic expression of BCR-ABL p210 in non-myeloid cells, co-transfected STAT5A is phosphorylated on Y694 and localized in the nucleus arguing for an additional factor mediating cytoplasmic retention in CML cells. Expression of the SFK v-Src, Hck or Lyn together with STAT5A results in phosphorylation on Y694 and cytoplasmic retention. Upon coexpression of BCR-ABL and individual SFK the cytoplasmic retention of activated STAT5A mediated by v-Src and Hck but not Lyn is dominant over nuclear translocation induced by BCR-ABL. Cytoplasmic retention depends on the kinase activity of SFK and is mediated through the interaction of the SH2 domain of STAT5A with the SFK. Interestingly, nuclear accumulation of STAT5A as a result of activation by FLT3-ITD, an oncogene found in acute myeloid leukemia, cannot be prevented by coexpression of SFK. Importantly, inhibition of SFK in K562 cells restored nuclear accumulation of pSTAT5A, enhanced STAT5 target gene expression and increased colony formation. Thus, SFK mediate cytoplasmic retention of pSTAT5A in BCR-ABL-positive cells. Cytoplasmic pSTAT5A in CML cells might balance the controversial functions of STAT5 in cellular senescence and differentiation versus G1/S progression and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2015065093,"XB130 is a newly characterized adaptor protein that was reported to promote thyroid tumor growth, but its role in the progression of other kinds of cancer such as gastric cancer (GC) remains unknown. Accordingly, we investigated the association between XB130 expression and the prognosis of GC patients. The subjects were 411 patients with GC in stages I to IV. XB130 expression was examined in surgical specimens of GC. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to assess the prognostic significance of XB130 for survival and recurrence. Moreover, GC cells stably transfected with XB130 short hairpin RNA were established to analyze the effect of XB130 on sensitivity of chemotherapy. The results show that both XB130 mRNA and protein expression were detectable in normal gastric tissues. The overall survival time of stage IV patients and the disease-free period after radical resection of GC in stage I-III patients were significantly shorter when immunohistochemical staining for XB130 was low than when staining was high (both p<0.05). XB130 expression also predicted tumor sensitivity to several chemotherapy agents. Viability of both XB130-silenced SGC7901 cells and wild-type cells was suppressed by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, and irinotecan in a dose-dependent way, but cisplatin and irinotecan were more sensitive against sXB130-silenced GC cells and 5-FU showed higher sensitivity to wild-type cells. When treated by 5-FU, patients with high expression of XB130 tumors had a higher survival rate than those with low expression tumors. These findings indicate that reduced XB130 protein expression is a prognostic biomarker for shorter survival and a higher recurrence rate in patients with GC, as well as for the response to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2064503485,"One major challenge in cancer research is to understand the complex interplay between the DNA damage response (DDR), genomic integrity, and tumor development. To address these issues, we analyzed 43 bladder tumor genomes from 22 patients using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, and tissue expression of multiple DDR proteins, including Timeless and its interaction partner Tipin. The SNP profiles confirmed and extended known copy number alterations (CNAs) at high resolution, showed clustering of CNAs at nine common fragile sites, and revealed that most metachronous tumors were clonally related. The occurrence of many novel uniparental disomy regions (UPDs) was of potential functional importance in some tumors because UPDs spanned mutated FGFR3 and PIK3CA alleles, and also homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor locus. The DDR signaling as evaluated by phospho-epitope-specific antibodies against Ser139-phosphorylated H2A histone family member X (γH2AX), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) was commonly activated in tumors with both moderate and high extent of accumulated genomic aberrations, the latter tumors showing a more frequent loss of ATM expression. Strikingly, the tumor genomes exhibiting the most complex alterations were associated with a high Ki67-proliferation index, abundant Timeless but not Tipin expression, aberrant p53 expression, and homozygous CDKN2A deletions. Of clinical relevance, evaluation of a tissue microarray (TMA; n=319) showed that abundant Timeless expression was associated with risk of progression to muscle-invasive disease (P<0.0005; hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-3.8) and higher T stage (P<0.05). Univariate analysis confirmed this association (P=0.006) in an independent cohort (n=241) but statistical significance was not reached in a multivariate model. Overall, our results are consistent with DDR activation preceding the accumulation of genomic aberrations. Tumors with extensive genomic rearrangements were associated with inactivation of CDKN2A, excessive proliferation, and robust Timeless expression, the latter also correlating with the risk of disease progression. Moreover, we provide evidence to suggest that UPDs likely contribute to bladder tumorigenesis."

Here, we report that IAP inhibitors synergized with lexatumumab, but not with mapatumumab, to reduce cell viability and to induce apoptosis in several RMS cell lines in a highly synergistic manner (combination index <0.1). Cotreatment-induced apoptosis was accompanied by enhanced activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3; loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; and caspase-dependent apoptosis. In addition, IAP inhibitor and lexatumumab cooperated to stimulate the assembly of a cytosolic complex containing RIP1, FADD, and caspase-8. Importantly, knockdown of RIP1 by RNA interference prevented the formation of the RIP1·FADD·caspase-8 complex and inhibited subsequent activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3; loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; and apoptosis upon treatment with IAP inhibitor and lexatumumab. In addition, RIP1 silencing rescued clonogenic survival of cells treated with the combination of lexatumumab and IAP inhibitor, thus underscoring the critical role of RIP1 in cotreatment-induced apoptosis. By comparison, the TNFα-blocking antibody Enbrel had no effect on IAP inhibitor/lexatumumab-induced apoptosis, indicating that an autocrine TNFα loop is dispensable. By demonstrating that IAP inhibitors and lexatumumab synergistically trigger apoptosis in a RIP1-dependent but TNFα-independent manner in RMS cells, our findings substantially advance our understanding of IAP inhibitor-mediated regulation of TRAIL-induced cell death.

HO-1 is an inducible enzyme, but HO-2 is constitutively expressed in selected tissues and is involved in signaling and regulatory processes. HO-2 has three cysteine residues that have been proposed to modulate the affinity for heme, whereas HO-1 has none. Here we use site-specific mutagenesis and two-dimensional NMR of l-[3-13C]cysteine-labeled proteins to determine the redox state of the individual cysteines in HO-2 and assess their roles in binding of heme. The results indicate that in the apoprotein, Cys282 and Cys265 are in the oxidized state, probably in an intramolecular disulfide bond. The addition of a reducing agent converts them to the reduced, free thiol state. Two-dimensional NMR of site-specific mutants reveals that the redox state of Cys265 and Cys282 varies with the presence or absence of other Cys residues, indicating that the microenvironments of the Cys residues are mutually interdependent. Cys265 appears to be in a relatively hydrophilic, oxidizable environment compared with Cys127 and Cys282. Chemical shift data indicate that none of the cysteines stably coordinates to the heme iron atom. In the oxidized state of the apoprotein, heme is bound 2.5-fold more tightly than in the reduced state. This small difference in heme affinity between the oxidized and reduced states of the protein is much less than previously reported, suggesting that it is not a significant factor in the physiological regulation of cellular heme levels.

Mammalian heme oxygenases are enzymes that, in the presence of O2 and NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase, degrade Fe(III) protoporphyrin IX (heme) to biliverdin IXα, Fe2+, and carbon monoxide (CO). The heme oxygenases are the only enzymes in mammals that physiologically degrade heme and are therefore essential for the maintenance of heme and iron homeostasis. In addition, the three products generated from heme oxygenase (HO) 2The abbreviations used are: HOheme oxygenaseHRMheme regulatory motifTCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine solution, neutral pHNBD-Cl4-chloro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazoleHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence. catalysis have important biological functions.

There are two functional human HO isoforms, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2). HO-1 is an inducible form expressed at high levels in the liver and spleen, whereas HO-2 is a constitutive form expressed at high levels in the brain and testis (4Trakshel G.M. Kutty R.K.

The primary physiological functions proposed for HO-2 are O2 sensing through regulation of the activity of the BK channel, a Ca2+-activated potassium channel (5Williams S.E. Wootton P. Mason H.S.

The major difference between these isoforms is the presence of heme regulatory motifs (HRMs) in HO-2 but not in HO-1. There are three HRM motifs in HO-2: HRM1, consisting of Lys264-Cys-Pro-Phe-Tyr-Ala269; HRM2, consisting of Ser281-Cys-Pro-Phe-Arg-Thr286; and HRM3, consisting of Gln126-Cys-Pro-Lys-Ala-Ala131. The HRM motifs have been found in a few other proteins whose functions are heme-dependent, such as heme-regulated initiation factor 2α kinase (9Chen J.J. Throop M.S. Gehrke L. Kuo I. Pal J.K.

The HRM motifs in HO-2 have been proposed to control the binding affinity of the protein for heme and the spin state of the heme iron (17Yi L. Ragsdale S.W.

Chem. 2007; 282: 21056-21067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This affinity was reported to be regulated by the presence or absence of a disulfide bond between Cys265 and Cys282 located in HRM1 and HRM2, respectively (17Yi L. Ragsdale S.W.

Reduction of this disulfide bond reportedly resulted in an ∼10-fold decrease in the HO-2 affinity for heme, suggesting a possible role for the HRMs in regulating the cellular levels of free heme, CO, iron, and biliverdin. There is no structural information on the region comprising Cys265 and Cys282 because it is missing in the HO-2 crystal structure (8Bianchetti C.M. Yi L. Ragsdale S.W. Phillips Jr., G.N.

Furthermore, no NMR structural data have been reported to date. However, NMR spectroscopy has been successfully employed in monitoring the redox state of Cys residues and protein conformational changes upon ligand binding or binding of other proteins. The NMR chemical shift of cysteine is sensitive to the redox state of the thiol and can be diagnostic of disulfide bond formation (18Sharma D. Rajarathnam K. 13C NMR chemical shifts can predict disulfide bond formation.J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this study, we utilized two-dimensional (1H,13C) NMR spectroscopy to shed light on the involvement of the cysteine residues of HO-2 in heme binding and catalysis. The HO-2 protein was labeled with l-[3-13C]cysteine, and two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra were recorded in the presence and absence of heme. Our results suggest that the Cys residues are not directly involved in heme binding, and the presence or absence of the intramolecular disulfide bond results in only a 2.5-fold, rather than 10-fold, difference in the binding affinity of HO-2 for heme. Hemin chloride, NADPH, BSA, EDTA, ampicillin, lysozyme, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, amino acids, nucleosides, PMSF, potassium phosphate monobasic and dibasic, and diamide all were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The disulfide bond-reducing tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine solution, neutral pH (TCEP) was purchased from Thermo Scientific.

Lysozyme was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The human HO-2 cDNA utilized in this study codes for residues 1–293 and thus lacks the 23 amino acids of the C terminus membrane binding region. In order to facilitate HO-2 protein purification, six histidine residues were inserted at the C terminus. The HO-2 mutants C127A, C265A, C282A, C127A/C265A, C127A/C282A, C265A/C282A, and C127A/C265A/C282A were prepared by introducing Cys to Ala mutations using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Genomics, La Jolla, CA). In addition, Met28 and Met30 were mutated to alanine in concert with Cys to Ala mutations to eliminate the presence of the alternative truncated HO-2 species consisting of either residues 28–293 or 30–293. Translation of these truncated species most likely results from the Shine-Delgarno sequence present at residues 24 and 25. Introduction of the Met to Ala double mutation did not affect HO-2 binding or activity. Mutations were introduced into the HO-2 cDNA in the pBAce cloning vector by PCR using forward and reverse primers (Invitrogen). Finally, the HO-2 gene was transferred into a pET21a expression vector (Novagen). The HO-2 expression construct was transformed into the cysteine auxotroph E. coli strain BL21(DE3)cysE51 and plated on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 50 μg/ml cysteine. A single colony was inoculated in 50 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 50 μg/ml cysteine. The overnight culture was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 19 amino acids and l-[3-13C]cysteine in place of unlabeled Cys, nucleosides, MgSO4, CaCl2, biotin, nicotinamide, thiamine, a trace element solution containing H3BO3, CoCl2, CuCl2, MnCl2, ZnCl2, FeCl3, and ampicillin and kanamycin, as described previously (21Jiang Y.

Protein expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (final concentration of 0.5 mm) for an additional 16 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 20 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4, buffer containing 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm PMSF, and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet. Cell lysis was performed by adding lysozyme (15 mg/liter) and stirring the solution for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by sonication using a Bronson sonicator (seven cycles, 1 min on, 1 min off at 50% power). The cell debris was separated from the soluble protein by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered (0.2 μm) and loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare), which was equilibrated with 50 mm potassium Pi, 1 mm EDTA, and 30 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.4. The column was washed with five column volumes of 50 mm potassium Pi, 1 mm EDTA, and 40 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, buffer, and the protein was eluted with 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, using a 0–500 mm imidazole gradient. After dialysis, the protein was consecutively loaded onto SP-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences), both pre-equilibrated with 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4, buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. Protein was eluted from the Q-Sepharose column with a 300-ml linear gradient of 50–400 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl buffer. The eluted HO-2 protein was subject to electrophoresis on a 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was visualized by SimplyBlue gel staining (Invitrogen) and was determined to be greater than 90% pure. Fractions containing the protein were combined and concentrated using 10,000 MWCO concentrators (Millipore). The protein was further dialyzed against 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4, buffer. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. The HO-2 expression vector was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli cells and plated on LB plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. A single colony was grown in 5 ml and later in 3 liters of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. The protein expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (final concentration of 0.5 mm) when A600 reached 0.6–0.8. Protein expression was carried out for 16 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C using a Beckman Coulter centrifuge, and the protein was purified using the same protocol as the 13Cys-labeled proteins described above. The activity of the HO-2 mutant proteins was determined by monitoring the rate of bilirubin formation at 468 nm using a Spectramax® UV-visible plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) as described previously (22Wilks A.

Reaction mixtures (200 μl) consisted of 0.4 μm HO-2, 1 μm NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, 4 μm biliverdin reductase, 15 μm hemin, 0.1 m potassium Pi, pH 7.4, buffer supplemented with 10 mg/ml BSA. The reactions were incubated at 22 °C for 2 min prior to the addition of 400 μm NADPH to initiate the reaction. The initial rate of bilirubin formation was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 43.5 mm−1 cm−1. The specific activity of the WT and mutant HO-2 proteins is expressed in nmol/min/mg. Incorporation of the [13Cβ]Cys-labeled amino acid into the HO-2 protein was specifically verified for the A127/13C265/13C282 mutant by LC/MS/electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis. The protein was loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (4–12% gradient) and visualized by gel staining with SimplyBlue Safe Protein Stain. The HO-2 protein band was excised and subjected to in-gel digestion according to a published protocol (24Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P.

The HPLC system employed was an Eldex MicroPro pumping system equipped with a 100 μm × 150-mm monolithic C18 column (Phenomenex Onyx). The mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water, whereas mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. After equilibration of the column at 5% B for 20 min, 1 μl of the extracted peptides was injected at a flow rate of 0.5 μl/min. After loading, the peptides were eluted by increasing the organic content linearly from 5 to 60% B over 35 min and then held at 35% B for 5 min. The eluent from the reverse phase column was coupled on-line to a microspray ion source attached to a QSTAR-XL hybrid QqTOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) operated in positive ion mode. MS Survey scans were acquired over an m/z range of 400–1800 for 1 s. The most abundant, multiply charged resonance in the survey scan was selected for collision-induced dissociation. MS/MS spectra were acquired for 3 s over an m/z range from 59 to 1800. Spectra were analyzed using Data Explorer software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Two-dimensional 1H,13C HSQC spectra were acquired on a Bruker 800-MHz spectrometer (Bruker Avance, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a 1H/13C/15N triple resonance ColdprobeTM with actively shielded pulse field gradients at 25 °C unless otherwise stated. Spectra were acquired with 60 scans using spectral widths of 8385 Hz (1H) and 1600 Hz (13C), 128 complex points in 1, and a 1-s recycle time. The 13C chemical shifts were calibrated to the reference (sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate) indirectly. Each NMR sample consisted of ∼300 μl of a 130–300 μm concentrated solution of [13C]Cys-labeled HO-2 protein in a 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.4, buffer with 10% D2O added as a lock solvent placed in a Shigemi tube. In the experiments with the reduced HO-2 protein, TCEP was added to a final concentration of 10-fold relative to the HO-2 protein. For the heme titration experiments, aliquots of a heme stock solution were added sequentially to reach the desired final concentrations for each experiment and incubated for 30 min, and then the spectrum was recorded. Data processing and analysis were performed using NMRPipe software (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe. A multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). The fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorimeter (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) at 22 °C. The HO-2 protein has one tryptophan residue, Trp121. The tryptophan was excited at 290 nm, and the emission spectrum was recorded at 310–500 nm with a maximum emission value at 338 nm. The excitation and emission slits were set at 8 nm. The emission spectrum of tryptophan fluorescence was measured at increasing concentrations of heme ligand. The fluorescence intensity of the 338 nm emission was plotted against the concentration of heme, and the data obtained were fitted to the quadratic equation,IF=IF0+ΔIF(KD+Pt+Lt)-(KD+Pt+Lt)2-4LtPt2Pt(Eq. 1) using non-linear least square regression analysis to calculate the dissociation constant of HO-2 for heme, where IF is the fluorescence intensity at a given heme concentration, IF0 is the fluorescence intensity in the absence of ligand, ΔIF is the change in fluorescence intensity on ligand binding, KD is the dissociation constant, and Pt and Lt are the total protein and ligand concentrations, respectively. The KD values represent the averages of two experiments conducted with separate samples. Best fit curves were generated with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The binding affinity of the reduced HO-2 for heme was determined by tryptophan fluorescence quenching after reduction of the Cys residues. The experiments were done under anaerobic conditions using a cuvette sealed with a septum (Hellma). The HO-2 protein solution and buffers were bubbled with argon to remove the oxygen. Furthermore, buffers were kept stirring in a glove box (Unilab) overnight prior to use. The oxygen level in the glove box was monitored by an oxygen sensor and kept at <2 ppm. The heme stock was prepared in the glove box using 0.1 n NaOH and 0.1 m potassium Pi, pH 7.4, solutions that were degassed prior to use. The heme solution was filtered using a 0.2-μm filter (Millipore), and its concentration was determined by the absorbance value at 385 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. The reduced HO-2 protein was obtained by incubating it with 10-fold TCEP for 30 min. TCEP was later removed using 500-μl centrifugal filter units of 10,000 MWCO (Millipore). The reduced HO-2 protein was placed in a 1-ml anaerobic cuvette sealed with a septum in the glove box. A second sealed cuvette containing buffer was used as a blank. The heme solution was also kept in an air-tight bottle and added to the HO-2 protein solution using a gas-tight syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV). The KD values of the reduced HO-2 for heme were calculated using the same method as that for the HO-2 titration done in the presence of air as described above. The redox state of Cys residues for the oxidized and reduced HO-2 was determined using the NBD-Cl fluorescent probe. The latter reacts with the protein Cys-SH group forming Cys-S-NBD and Cys-SOH forming the Cys-S(O)-NBD product, both of which have a characteristic absorbance at 420 and 347 nm, respectively. The reduced HO-2 protein was obtained by incubating it with a 10-fold excess of TCEP for 30 min in the glove box. TCEP was later removed using 0.5-ml 10,000 MWCO centrifugal filter units. Both the oxidized and reduced HO-2 proteins (20 μm) were then reacted with 500 μm NBD-Cl (25-fold excess) for 45 min at 22 °C. The unbound NBD-Cl was removed by buffer exchanging three times using 0.5-ml 10,000 MWCO centrifugal filter units. The absorption spectra of the oxidized and reduced HO-2 were then recorded under anaerobic conditions on a Cary 50 spectrophotometer (Varian). [13C]Cys-labeled HO-2 mutant proteins were expressed in M9 minimal medium using BL21(DE3)cysE51 auxotrophic cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” The proteins expressed were 13C127/A265/A282 (13C/A/A), A127/13C265/A282 (A/13C/A), A127/A265/13C282 (A/A/13C), A127/13C265/13C282 (A/13C/13C), 13C127/13C265/A282 (13C/13C/A), 13C127/A265/13C282 (13C/A/13C), and 13C127/13C265/13C282 (13C/13C/13C), in which one, two, or three Cys residues were 13C-isotopically labeled. The other Cys residue(s) normally present in HO-2 was mutated to an Ala. In the abbreviated nomenclature shown, the residues at positions 127, 265, and 282 are listed, in that order, with an A for alanine and C or 13C for unlabeled or labeled cysteine. The specific activities of these proteins were measured to ensure that their structures and catalytic properties were similar to those of the corresponding unlabeled proteins. The specific activity was measured using a coupled enzymatic assay in which the formation of bilirubin is monitored at 468 nm, as described under “Materials and Methods.” All of the isotopically labeled mutant HO-2 proteins had specific activities similar to those of both the WT (28 nmol/min/mg) and the corresponding unlabeled, mutant proteins, confirming that they are fully active (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of the two-dimensional NMR chemical shifts for the oxidized and reduced [13C]Cys-labeled HO-2 apoproteins, their binding affinities for ferric heme, and their catalytic activitiesHO-2 proteinWithout TCEPWith TCEPSpecific activityReduced [13C]CysOxidized [13C]CysKd for hemeReduced [13C]CysOxidized [13C]CysKd for hemeppmppmnmppmppmnmnmol/min/mg13C/13C/13C40.5:3.115728.0:2.821462840.5:2.92A/13C/13C40.5:3.119028.0:2.821113440.5:2.9213C/A/A105ND2913C/A/13C38.3:3.0510228.0:2.8438.3:3.053162638.3:2.7628.0:2.8038.3:2.76(doublet)13C/13C/A28.0:2.8238.7:3.034528.0:2.8238.7:3.033733938.7:2.6838.7:2.68A/A/13C28.0:2.843128.0:2.84262128.0:2.8028.0:2.80(doublet)(doublet)A/13C/A38.7:3.0410328.0:2.82772938.7:2.68A/A/A544736 Open table in a new tab Incorporation of [13C]Cys into HO-2 was specifically verified for the A/13C/13C protein by LC/MS/electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis. Although the difference of only 1 mass unit between 12C and 13C isotopes poses a challenge in accurately determining the efficiency of incorporation of the [13C]Cys amino acid, the data clearly revealed the presence of both the [12C]Cys and [13C]Cys amino acids in the protein, with the latter constituting more than 50% of the mixture (data not shown). To determine the redox state of the native HO-2 apoprotein, two-dimensional NMR (1H,13C HSQC) spectroscopic analysis of the 13C/13C/13C protein, in which all three Cys residues are isotopically labeled, was performed. The spectrum revealed the presence of two major resonances (Fig. 1A and Table 1): one at 13C = 40.5 ppm, 1H = 3.11 ppm and the second at 13C = 40.5 ppm, 1H = 2.92 ppm, partially overlapping a non-cysteine-related resonance at 13C = 42 ppm, 1H = 2.93 ppm.

We have used the zebrafish as a model to analyze Kcnh1 function in vitro and in vivo. We found that the kcnh1 gene is duplicated in teleost fish (i.e. kcnh1a and kcnh1b) and that both genes are maternally expressed during early development. In adult zebrafish, kcnh1a and kcnh1b have distinct expression patterns but share expression in brain and testis. Heterologous expression of both genes in Xenopus oocytes revealed a strong conservation of characteristic functional properties between human and fish channels, including a unique sensitivity to intracellular Ca(2+)/calmodulin and modulation of voltage-dependent gating by extracellular Mg(2+). Using a morpholino antisense approach, we demonstrate a strong kcnh1 loss-of-function phenotype in developing zebrafish, characterized by growth retardation, delayed hindbrain formation, and embryonic lethality. This late phenotype was preceded by transcriptional up-regulation of known cell-cycle inhibitors (p21, p27, cdh2) and down-regulation of pro-proliferative factors, including cyclin D1, at 70% epiboly. These results reveal an unanticipated basic activity of kcnh1 that is crucial for early embryonic development and patterning."
https://openalex.org/W2023858601,"The p53 tumor suppressor is important in many aspects of cell biology. Tight regulation of p53 is thus imperative for maintaining cell homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis. The stabilization and activity of p53 is primarily regulated by MDM2, which is encoded for by HDM2. However, how the expression and activity of MDM2 is regulated remains largely unknown. Here, we report a novel BTB and BEN domains-containing protein, RBB. We demonstrated that RBB is a novel transcriptional repressor binding specific DNA motif via a homodimer and interacting with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Genome wide transcription target analysis by ChIP sequencing revealed that RBB represses the transcription of a series of functionally important genes including HDM2. We showed that RBB recruits the NuRD complex to the internal promoter of HDM2 and inhibits the expression of MDM2 protein, leading to subsequent stabilization of tumor suppressor p53. Significantly, we showed that RBB suppresses cell proliferation and sensitizes cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Our data indicate that RBB is a novel transcriptional repressor and an important regulator of p53 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2060041903,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease threatening human health around the world. Type I interferon (IFN) and cytokine production are crucial in the innate immune system. We previously reported that DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) induced low levels of interferon regulatory factor 3 and NF-κB activation, thus leading to reduced production of IFN-β in the early phase of infection. Here, we determined whether DENV infection not only hampers type I IFN activation but also cytokine production triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling.We used quantitative RT-PCR and found that only low levels of IFN-β and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA were detected in DENV-2-infected bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells. Furthermore, DENV-2 infection repressed cytokine production triggered by TLR signaling. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this suppression event, we measured NF-κB activation by p65 nuclear translocation and luciferase reporter assay and found that NF-κB activation triggered by TLR ligands was blocked by DENV-2 infection. As well, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity was suppressed by DENV-2 infection.To downregulate the host innate immunity, DENV-2 by itself is a weak inducer of type I IFN and cytokines, furthermore DENV-2 can also block the TLR-triggered ERK-NF-κB activation and cytokine production."
https://openalex.org/W2092297110,"The 2009 H1N1 outbreak provides an opportunity to learn about the strengths and weaknesses of current U.S. public health surveillance systems and to identify implications for measuring public health emergency preparedness.We adopted a ""triangulation"" approach in which multiple contemporary data sources, each with different expected biases, are compared to identify time patterns that are likely to reflect biases versus those that are more likely to be indicative of actual infection rates. This approach is grounded in the understanding that surveillance data are the result of a series of decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities. Although limited by the lack of a gold standard, this analysis suggests that children and young adults are over-represented in many pH1N1 surveillance systems, especially in the spring wave. In addition, the nearly two-month delay between the Northeast and the South in the Fall peak in some surveillance data seems to at least partially reflect regional differences in concerns about pH1N1 rather than real differences in pH1N1 infection rates.Although the extent of the biases suggested by this analysis cannot be known precisely, the analysis identifies underlying problems with surveillance systems--in particular their dependence on patient and provider behavior, which is influenced by a changing information environment--that could limit situational awareness in future public health emergencies. To improve situational awareness in future health emergencies, population-based surveillance systems such as telephone surveys of representative population samples and seroprevalence surveys in well-defined population cohorts are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2001811732,"GAB2 is a scaffold protein with diverse upstream and downstream effectors. MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways are known effectors of GAB2. It is amplified and overexpressed in a variety of human tumors including melanoma. Here we show a previously undescribed role for GAB2 in NRAS-driven melanoma. Specifically, we found that GAB2 is co-expressed with mutant NRAS in melanoma cell lines and tumor samples and its expression correlated with metastatic potential. Co-expression of GAB2(WT) and NRAS(G12D) in melanocytes and in melanoma cells increased anchorage-independent growth by providing GAB2-expressing cells a survival advantage through upregulation of BCL-2 family of anti-apoptotic factors. Of note, collaboration of GAB2 with mutant NRAS enhanced tumorigenesis in vivo and led to an increased vessel density with strong CD34 and VEGFR2 activity. We found that GAB2 facilitiated an angiogenic switch by upregulating HIF-1α and VEGF levels. This angiogenic response was significantly suppressed with the MEK inhibitor PD325901. These data suggest that GAB2-mediated signaling cascades collaborate with NRAS-driven downstream activation for conferring an aggressive phenotype in melanoma. Second, we show that GAB2/NRAS signaling axis is non-linear and non-redundant in melanocytes and melanoma, and thus are acting independent of each other. Finally, we establish a link between GAB2 and angiogenesis in melanoma for the first time. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that GAB2 is a novel regulator of tumor angiogenesis in NRAS-driven melanoma through regulation of HIF-1α and VEGF expressions mediated by RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2132228138,"Background Rgs1, a prototypical Regulator of G protein Signaling, negatively modulates the cyclic AMP pathway thereby influencing various aspects of asexual development and pathogenesis in the rice-blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Rgs1 possesses tandem DEP motifs (termed DEP-A and DEP-B; for Dishevelled, Egl-10, Pleckstrin) at the N-terminus, and a Gα-GTP interacting RGS catalytic core domain at the C-terminus. In this study, we focused on gaining further insights into the mechanisms of Rgs1 regulation and subcellular localization by characterizing the role(s) of the individual domains and the full-length protein during asexual development and pathogenesis in Magnaporthe. Methodology/Principal Findings Utilizing western blot analysis and specific antisera against the N- and C-terminal halves of Rgs1, we identify and report the in vivo endoproteolytic processing/cleavage of full-length Rgs1 that yields an N-terminal DEP and a RGS core domain. Independent expression of the resultant DEP-DEP half (N-Rgs1) or RGS core (C-Rgs1) fragments, failed to complement the rgs1Δ defects in colony morphology, aerial hyphal growth, surface hydrophobicity, conidiation, appressorium formation and infection. Interestingly, the full-length Rgs1-mCherry, as well as the tagged N-terminal DEP domains (individually or in conjunction) localized to distinct punctate vesicular structures in the cytosol, while the catalytic RGS core motif was predominantly vacuolar. Conclusions/Significance Based on our data from sequence alignments, immuno-blot and microscopic analysis, we propose that the post-translational proteolytic processing of Rgs1 and the vacuolar sequestration of the catalytic RGS domain represents an important means of down regulating Rgs1 function and thus forming an additional and alternative means of regulating G protein signaling in Magnaporthe. We further hypothesize the prevalence of analogous mechanisms functioning in other filamentous fungi. Furthermore, we conclusively assign a specific vesicular/membrane targeting function for the N-terminal DEP domains of Rgs1 in the rice-blast fungus."
https://openalex.org/W2070520946,"The homeobox transcription factor Mohawk (Mkx) is a potent transcriptional repressor expressed in the embryonic precursors of skeletal muscle, cartilage, and bone. MKX has recently been shown to be a critical regulator of musculoskeletal tissue differentiation and gene expression; however, the genetic pathways through which MKX functions and its DNA-binding properties are currently unknown. Using a modified bacterial one-hybrid site selection assay, we determined the core DNA-recognition motif of the mouse monomeric Mkx homeodomain to be A-C-A. Using cell-based assays, we have identified a minimal Mkx-responsive element (MRE) located within the Mkx promoter, which is composed of a highly conserved inverted repeat of the core Mkx recognition motif. Using the minimal MRE sequence, we have further identified conserved MREs within the locus of Sox6, a transcription factor that represses slow fiber gene expression during skeletal muscle differentiation. Real-time PCR and immunostaining of in vitro differentiated muscle satellite cells isolated from Mkx-null mice revealed an increase in the expression of Sox6 and down-regulation of slow fiber structural genes. Together, these data identify the unique DNA-recognition properties of MKX and reveal a novel role for Mkx in promoting slow fiber type specification during skeletal muscle differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2004945089,"RNA polymerases undergo substantial structural and functional changes in transitioning from sequence-specific initial transcription to stable and relatively sequence-independent elongation. Initially, transcribing complexes are characteristically unstable, yielding short abortive products on the path to elongation. However, protein mutations have been isolated in RNA polymerases that dramatically reduce abortive instability. Understanding these mutations is essential to understanding the energetics of initial transcription and promoter clearance. We demonstrate here that the P266L point mutation in T7 RNA polymerase, which shows dramatically reduced abortive cycling, also transitions to elongation later, i.e. at longer lengths of RNA. These two properties of the mutant are not necessarily coupled, but rather we propose that they both derive from a weakening of the barrier to RNA-DNA hybrid-driven rotation of the promoter binding N-terminal platform, a motion necessary to achieve programmatically timed release of promoter contacts in the transition to elongation. Parallels in the multisubunit RNA polymerases are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2146447773,"Detoxification enzymes play a key role in plant-herbivore interactions, contributing to the on-going evolution of ecosystem functional diversity. Mammalian detoxification systems have been well studied by the medical and pharmacological industries to understand human drug metabolism; however, little is known of the mechanisms employed by wild herbivores to metabolize toxic plant secondary compounds. Using a wild rodent herbivore, the desert woodrat (Neotoma lepida), we investigated genomic structural variation, sequence variability, and expression patterns in a multigene subfamily involved in xenobiotic metabolism, cytochrome P450 2B (CYP2B). We hypothesized that differences in CYP2B expression and sequence diversity could explain differential abilities of woodrat populations to consume native plant toxins. Woodrats from two distinct populations were fed diets supplemented with either juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) or creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), plants consumed by woodrats in their respective desert habitats. We used Southern blot and quantitative PCR to determine that the genomic copy number of CYP2B in both populations was equivalent, and similar in number to known rodent copy number. We compared CYP2B expression patterns and sequence diversity using cloned hepatic CYP2B cDNA. The resulting sequences were very diverse, and clustered into four major clades by amino acid similarity. Sequences from the experimental treatments were distributed non-randomly across a CYP2B tree, indicating unique expression patterns from woodrats on different diets and from different habitats. Furthermore, within each major CYP2B clade, sequences shared a unique combination of amino acid residues at 13 sites throughout the protein known to be important for CYP2B enzyme function, implying differences in the function of each major CYP2B variant. This work is the most comprehensive investigation of the genetic diversity of a detoxification enzyme subfamily in a wild mammalian herbivore, and contributes an initial genetic framework to our understanding of how a wild herbivore responds to critical changes in its diet."
https://openalex.org/W2062089073,"NAD(P)H cytochrome b(5) oxidoreductase (Ncb5or), comprising cytochrome b(5) and cytochrome b(5) reductase domains, is widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms. Although Ncb5or plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism of mice, so far no Ncb5or gene has been reported in the unicellular parasitic protozoa Leishmania species. We have cloned, expressed, and characterized Ncb5or gene from Leishmania major. Steady state catalysis and spectral studies show that NADH can quickly reduce the ferric state of the enzyme to the ferrous state and is able to donate an electron(s) to external acceptors. To elucidate its exact physiological role in Leishmania, we attempted to create NAD(P)H cytochrome b(5) oxidoreductase from L. major (LmNcb5or) knock-out mutants by targeted gene replacement technique. A free fatty acid profile in knock-out (KO) cells reveals marked deficiency in linoleate and linolenate when compared with wild type (WT) or overexpressing cells. KO culture has a higher percentage of dead cells compared with both WT and overexpressing cells. Increased O(2) uptake, uncoupling and ATP synthesis, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential are evident in KO cells. Flow cytometric analysis reveals the presence of a higher concentration of intracellular H(2)O(2), indicative of increased oxidative stress in parasites lacking LmNcb5or. Cell death is significantly reduced when the KO cells are pretreated with BSA bound linoleate. Real time PCR studies demonstrate a higher Δ12 desaturase, superoxide dismutase, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA with a concomitant fall in Δ9 desaturase mRNA expression in LmNcb5or null cell line. Together these findings suggest that decreased linoleate synthesis, and increased oxidative stress and apoptosis are the major consequences of LmNcb5or deficiency in Leishmania."
https://openalex.org/W1989834529,"The furanocoumarin compound bergapten is a plant secondary metabolite that has anti-insect function. When incorporated into artificial diet, it retarded cowpea bruchid development, decreased fecundity, and caused mortality at a sufficient dose. cDNA microarray analysis indicated that cowpea bruchid altered expression of 543 midgut genes in response to dietary bergapten. Among these bergapten-regulated genes, 225 have known functions; for instance, those encoding proteins related to nutrient transport and metabolism, development, detoxification, defense and various cellular functions. Such differential gene regulation presumably facilitates the bruchids' countering the negative effect of dietary bergapten. Many genes did not have homology (E-value cutoff 10(-6)) with known genes in a BlastX search (206), or had homology only with genes of unknown function (112). Interestingly, when compared with the transcriptomic profile of cowpea bruchids treated with dietary soybean cysteine protease inhibitor N (scN), 195 out of 200 coregulated midgut genes are oppositely regulated by the two compounds. Simultaneous administration of bergapten and scN attenuated magnitude of change in selected oppositely-regulated genes, as well as led to synergistic delay in insect development. Therefore, targeting insect vulnerable sites that may compromise each other's counter-defensive response has the potential to increase the efficacy of the anti-insect molecules."

MMP-11 hardly cleaves ECM components but rather natural substrates like serin protease inhibitors (serpins) such as α2-macroglobulin and α1-proteinase inhibitor, as well as insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (20Chaussain-Miller C.

Additionally, degradation of serpins such as α1-proteinase inhibitor results in increased concentrations of serin proteases that focally break down the basement membrane, initiating early invasive processes (3Masson R.

Haemost. 1997; 78: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Activation of MMP-11 differs, because of its furin cleavage site (18Noël A. Santavicca M. Stoll I. L'Hoir C. Staub A. Murphy G. Rio M.C. Basset P. Identification of structural determinants controlling human and mouse stromelysin-3 proteolytic activities.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22866-22872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The prodomain, responsible for autoinhibition of MMP-11 (proMMP-11), is cleaved intracellularly by the Golgi-associated protease furin, resulting in secretion of the α-isoform (48 kDa) to the extracellular space (17Pei D. Weiss S.J. Furin-dependent intracellular activation of the human stromelysin-3 zymogen.Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Additionally, a nonsecreted, directly translated, fully active β-isoform (40 kDa), lacking the prodomain as well as 32 N-terminal amino acids was detected in cultured cells and placenta (24Luo D. Mari B. Stoll I. Anglard P. Alternative splicing and promoter usage generates an intracellular stromelysin 3 isoform directly translated as an active matrix metalloproteinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25527-25536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Visse R. Nagase H. Matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Structure, function, and biochemistry.Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (3665) Google Scholar). The function of this β-MMP-11, however, remains unknown. Detailed experimental results about the activity of both isoforms of MMP-11 have not been performed, and their entanglement in tumor progression, invasion, or apoptosis is still poorly understood (25Visse R. Nagase H. Matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Structure, function, and biochemistry.Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (3665) Google Scholar). Therefore, imaging probes for MMP-11 are important tools to further clarify activation, regulation, and functional significance of both extracellular α-MMP-11 and even more intracellularly active β-MMP-11. For the visualization of MMP active tissues, intracellular imaging has distinct advantages, because extracellular fluorescent probes can diffuse away from their site of formation, delivering less precise spatial images of molecular target distribution. Moreover, intracellular imaging probes accumulate in the cell over time and increase the signal to noise ratio significantly. Addressing molecular targets such as MMP-11 in living organism calls for highly affine, specific probes that can be activated and produce a distinct, amplified signal to detect small intra- or extracellular concentrations of the enzyme (26Weissleder R. Mahmood U. Molecular imaging.Radiology. 2001; 219: 316-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Fluorescent optical imaging is rapidly expanding as a noninvasive method for disease and tumor progression evaluation, providing high sensitivity at nanomolar concentrations, use of nonradioactive materials, and safe detection, while employing readily available instruments at moderate cost (27Kovar J.L. Simpson M.A. Schutz-Geschwender A. Olive D.M. A systematic approach to the development of fluorescent contrast agents for optical imaging of mouse cancer models.Anal. Biochem. 2007; 367: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 28Lee S. Xie J. Chen X. Peptides and peptide hormones for molecular imaging and disease diagnosis.Chem. Rev. 2010; 110: 3087-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Especially peptides susceptible for protease cleavage are used to specifically detect the presence and activity of enzymes in vitro and in vivo. Combination of these protease-sensitive peptides with fluorescent labels allows the generation of “smart” probes, developing a distinct fluorescent signal upon cleavage, whereas the inactivated probe remains invisible, because of FRET (29Förster T. Intermolecular energy transfer and fluorescence.Annals of Physics. 1948; 6: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4921) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, benchmark peptidic FRET substrates for MMPs such as Mca-PLG-LDap(Dnp)AR-NH2 (OmniMMPTM; Enzo Life Sciences, Inc.) are not cleaved by hMMP-11 (30Kannan R. Ruff M. Kochins J.G. Manly S.P. Stoll I. El Fahime M. Noël A. Foidart J.M. Rio M.C. Dive V. Basset P. Purification of active matrix metalloproteinase catalytic domains and its use for screening of specific stromelysin-3 inhibitors.Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 16: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Commercially available substrates for MMP-11 (Mca-PLA-C(OMeBn)WARDap(Dnp)-NH2; Merck; kcat/Km = 3.6 × 104 m−1 s−1), however, have only been tested with murine MMP-11 (mMMP-11) and use fluorophores that strongly interfere with cellular autofluorescence (31Monici M. Cell and tissue autofluorescence research and diagnostic applications.Biotechnol. Annu. Rev. 2005; 11: 227-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Additionally, autofluorescence of common aromatic building blocks used in screenings for potential binders can interfere with the assay readout, especially with substrates detected at shorter wavelengths. Therefore, substrates, readily available for cellular detection and monitoring of enzyme activities intra- and extracellularly, as well as for compound screenings, pose a strong need for further development. Here we describe the synthesis, in vitro evaluation, and live cell visualization of hMMP-11 activated, cell-penetrating peptides that can be used as imaging tools for the detection of tumorigenesis and invasion-related protease MMP-11. Reagents and resins were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros Organics, Novabiochem, and ChemPep Inc. and were used without further purification. All of the matrix metalloprotease catalytic domains were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (Lörrach, Germany). Purchased MMP-11 was produced in Escherichia coli. from human cDNA. A unit for the protease activity was not provided for MMP-11. The original buffer system of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 300 mm NaCl, 20 μm ZnCl2, 0.5% Brij-35, and 30% glycerol at pH 7.5 was adjusted to a final concentration of 50% glycerol and 1% BSA to increase stability. Fluorescein-Dabcyl-labeled substrates were synthesized via Fmoc-mediated solid phase synthesis on O-(methoxyethoxy-methyl)-5-amino-fluorescein 2-chlorotrityl resin that has been reported previously (32Uryga-Polowy V. Kosslick D. Freund C. Rademann J. Resin-bound aminofluorescein for C-terminal labeling of peptides. High-affinity polarization probes binding to polyproline-specific GYF domains.ChemBioChem. 2008; 9: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). First, Fmoc-protected glycine was added to a solution of 5 eq of HATU and 10 eq of 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine (collidine) in DMF/DCM (1:1, v/v) to the prepared O-(methoxy-ethoxymethyl)-5-amino-fluorescein 2-chlorotrityl resin for 3 h at room temperature, twice. Fmoc determination yielded 58% coupling efficiency. The remaining coupling positions were capped with MeOH/DIPEA/DCM (0.5:1:1, v/v/v). The Fmoc group was removed with 20% piperidine in DMF, twice, for 10 min. The following amino acids were coupled by the addition of 3 eq of Fmoc-protected amino acid, 3 eq of diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), 3 eq of hydroxy benzotriazole (HOBt), and 3 eq of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in DMF for 3 h. Fmoc deblocking and coupling steps were repeated for additional amino acid couplings. Completeness of couplings was tested with a Kaiser test (33Coin I. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Solid-phase peptide synthesis. From standard procedures to the synthesis of difficult sequences.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 3247-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The Dabcyl quencher was introduced by coupling 3 eq of Nα-Fmoc-Nϵ-4-[4-(dimethyl-amino)-phenylazo)benzoyl]-l-lysine with 3 eq of HOBt and 3 eq of DIC in DMF overnight at room temperature. All peptides were N-acetylated in the last step with 1 ml of acetic anhydride/DCM/DIPEA (1:1:1, v/v/v) for 10 min at room temperature. Cleavage cocktails were applied to the resins for 24 h at room temperature. DCM/TFA/H2O/Phenol/EDT/TIS (50:40:4:1:2.5:2.5, v/v/v/m/v/v) for substrates containing MeOBn protected cysteine, whereas DCM/TFA/H2O/Phenol/EDT/TIS (5:90:2:1:1:1, v/v/v/m/v/v) was used for leucine containing peptides. Substrates were precipitated in ether and were washed thrice with ether/MeCN (95:5) followed by drying in vacuo and isolation by reverse phase HPLC (Agilent 1100 Series, C18 ec, 100 Å, 7 μm, 21 × 250 mm column (Macherey-Nagel; Nucleodur®). SM-P155 was synthesized employing AMCA that was Fmoc-protected as has been reported previously (34Wood W.J. Patterson A.W. Tsuruoka H. Jain R.K. Ellman J.A. Substrate activity screening. A fragment-based method for the rapid identification of nonpeptidic protease inhibitors.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 15521-15527Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Fmoc-protected Rink amide resin was deprotected with 20% piperidine in DMF, twice, for 10 min at room temperature. 3 eq of Fmoc-AMCA were activated with 3 eq of HOBt and 3 eq of DIC. The mixture was added to the Rink amide resin and was stirred for 3 h at room temperature. Loading efficiency (∼85%) was determined via Fmoc determination. Glycine was coupled using 5 eq of glycine, 5 eq of HATU, and 10 eq of collidine with Fmoc-deprotected AMCA-resin overnight at room temperature, twice. The following amino acid couplings afforded 3 eq of amino acid, 3 eq of HOBt, and 3 eq of DIC in DMF for 3 h at room temperature. Repeated Fmoc deblocking and coupling yielded the AMCA-labeled peptide sequence. The quencher was introduced by coupling of 3 eq of Fmoc-N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-lysine (Fmoc-K(Dnp)-OH) with equivalent amounts of HOBt and DIC in DMF for 3 h at room temperature. Completed sequences were acetylated in the last step with a 1:1:1, v/v/v mixture of acetic anhydride/DIPEA/DCM for 10 min at room temperature. All substrates were measured on a Tecan Saphire2 Reader on a Corning number 3544 microplate in MMP assay buffer at pH 7.5 at concentrations of 5 and 0.5 μm for absorption and emission spectra, respectively. The spectra were recorded at 483 ± 10 nm (excitation) and 525 ± 10 nm (emission). 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Brij-35 was used as the buffer system (35Nuti E. Panelli L. Casalini F. Avramova S.I. Orlandini E. Santamaria S. Nencetti S. Tuccinardi T. Martinelli A. Cercignani G. D'Amelio N. Maiocchi A. Uggeri F. Rossello A.

Chem. 2009; 52: 6347-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All of the substrates were prepared as 10 mm stock solutions in Me2SO. A stock dilution series in Me2SO ranging from 400 to 20 μm, and 0 μm (Me2SO) as a negative control was prepared with a further dilution factor of 20. 1 μl of each stock concentration in three replicates was pipetted to the microplate and 19 μl of enzyme (12.5 nm for MMP-11 and 0.625 nm for MMP-14, determined by enzyme titration) were added to start kinetic measurements. Substrate in buffer without enzyme functioned as a negative control and as a fluorescence background measurement. 100% hydrolysis was measured in respect to these fluorescence standards: Ac-C(MeOBn)RMGG-Fluo, Ac-C(MeOBn)VRGG-Fluo, Ac-C(MeOBn)-WARGG-Fluo, Ac-LRMGG-Fluo, Ac-LVRGG-Fluo, and Ac-LWARGG-Fluo. Concentrations used correspond to 2–10% (final assay concentration, 1–1000 nm) of hydrolyzed substrate to avoid quenching effects in solution. MMP-11 cleavage was monitored at λ = 483 ± 10 nm (excitation) and λ = 525 ± 10 nm (emission). All plates were covered with a PCR-foil Ultra Clear room temperature-PCR (G060/UC-RT) from G. Kisker GbR to avoid evaporation during kinetic measurements at 28 °C. The results were analyzed by plotting and fitting the curves with Prism 5.0 (Graph Pad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1),Y=Vmax(X/(Km+X))(Eq. 1) where Y is the substrate velocity in nm/min, and X is the substrate concentration in μm. Stock concentrations in Me2SO were prepared of GM6001 ranging from 3.125 mm to 31.25 μm (dilution factor to final concentration = 50, 1% Me2SO). 1 μl of each stock dilution of inhibitor was pipetted into three wells each and was mixed with 24 μl of 2 nm MMP-11 (final concentration, 1 nm) in assay buffer. The plate was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and 25 μl of 1.5 μm SM-P124 (final concentration, 0.75 μm) in assay buffer were added to all wells to start the reaction. Fluorescence intensity was recorded for 30 min at 37 °C. As a substrate activity control, several wells of MMP-11 with SM-P124 but without inhibitor were measured, as well as just SM-P124 in assay buffer serving as a fluorescence background measurement. LC/MS-TOF measurements were performed on an Agilent Accurate-Mass 6220 TOF LC/MS station equipped with a diode array detector and a 1200 series LC. Liquid chromatography was performed employing Agilent's ZORBAX® Eclipse column XDB-C18 Rapid Resolution HT 50 × 4.6 mm with 1.8-μm particle size. High resolution masses of all compounds were determined with a deviation of <0.5. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm LiCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 Complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablet (Roche Applied Science)). Protein concentration of supernatants was determined with a Bradford Assay. Laemmli buffer was added (5:1), the samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and were loaded to the gel (Criterion; Tris-glycine 4–20%). Bio-Rad Precision Plus Protein Standard Dual Color was used as a protein size reference. The gel was run at 200 V for 75 min in Tris-glycine buffer. The proteins were electroblotted to a PVDF membrane at 200 mA for 1 h. Washing steps in TBS-T buffer (3 × 10 min) were applied after blocking overnight with 5% BSA in TBS-T and after each incubation with antibodies. Anti-MMP-11 (Abcam, monoclonal mouse antibody, clone SL3.05 (ab85648)) was applied in blocking buffer (5% BSA in TBS-T buffer) at a 1:500 dilution for 1.5 h at room temperature. Goat anti-mouse HRP-labeled antibody from Dianova was diluted 1:10,000 and was applied for 1 h at room temperature. ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce) was mixed 1:1 and applied to the membrane for 1.5 min at room temperature. The images were recorded on a Fuji LSA 4000 luminescent analyzer. The membrane was stripped (4 × 10 min 6 m guanidine HCl, 20"
https://openalex.org/W2076934051,"It is well established that epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent mitogen in cells expressing EGF receptor (EGFR). However, a body of evidence indicated that the effects of mitogenic EGF signaling exhibit a non-monotonic, or biphasic dose response curve; EGF at low concentrations elicits a mitogenic signaling pathway to stimulate cell proliferation while at high concentrations, EGF inhibits cell growth. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this paradoxical effect of EGF on cell proliferation remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the biphasic EGF signaling in ER-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells, both of which express endogenous EGFR. We found that EGF at low concentrations induced the phosphorylation of the Src-Y416 residue, an event to activate Src, while at high concentrations allowed Src-Y527 phosphorylation that inactivates Src. EGF at 10 ng/ml also induced phosphorylation of the MAPK/ERK and activated cyclin D1 promoter activity through the Src/EGFR/STAT5 pathways but not at a higher concentration (500 ng/ml). Our results thus demonstrated that Src functions as a switch of EGF signaling depending on concentrations of EGF."
https://openalex.org/W1977831525,"The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) enables the flow of viral peptides generated in the cytosol by the proteasome and other proteases to the endoplasmic reticulum, where they complex with nascent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I. Later, these peptide-HLA class I complexes can be recognized by CD8(+) lymphocytes. Cancerous cells and infected cells in which TAP is blocked, as well as individuals with unusable TAP complexes, are able to present peptides on HLA class I by generating them through TAP-independent processing pathways. Here, we identify a physiologically processed HLA-E ligand derived from the D8L protein in TAP-deficient vaccinia virus-infected cells. This natural high affinity HLA-E class I ligand uses alternative interactions to the anchor motifs previously described to be presented on nonclassical HLA class I molecules. This octameric peptide was also presented on HLA-Cw1 with similar binding affinity on both classical and nonclassical class I molecules. In addition, this viral peptide inhibits HLA-E-mediated cytolysis by natural killer cells. Comparison between the amino acid sequences of the presenting HLA-E and HLA-Cw1 alleles revealed a shared structural motif in both HLA class molecules, which could be related to their observed similar cross-reactivity affinities. This motif consists of several residues located on the floor of the peptide-binding site. These data expand the role of HLA-E as an antigen-presenting molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2152891965,"Ectopic pregnancy (EP) remains the most life-threatening acute condition in modern gynaecology. It remains difficult to diagnose early and accurately. Women often present at emergency departments in early pregnancy with a 'pregnancy of unknown location' (PUL) and diagnosis/exclusion of EP is challenging due to a lack of reliable biomarkers. Recent studies suggest that serum levels of a disintegrin and metalloprotease protein-12 (ADAM-12) can be used differentiate EP from viable intrauterine pregnancy (VIUP). Here we describe a prospective study evaluating the performance of ADAM-12 in differentiating EP from the full spectrum of alternative PUL outcomes in an independent patient cohort.Sera were collected from 120 patients at their first clinical presentation with a PUL and assayed for ADAM-12 by ELISA. Patients were categorized according to final pregnancy outcomes. Serum ADAM-12 concentrations were increased in women with histologically-confirmed EP (median 442 pg/mL; 25%-75% percentile 232-783 pg/mL) compared to women with VIUP (256 pg/mL; 168-442 pg/mL) or miscarriage (192 pg/mL; 133-476 pg/mL). Serum ADAM-12 did not differentiate histologically-confirmed EP from spontaneously resolving PUL (srPUL) (416 pg/mL; 154-608 pg/mL). The diagnostic potential of ADAM-12 was only significant when 'ambiguous' PUL outcomes were excluded from the analysis (AROC = 0.6633; P = 0.03901).When measured in isolation, ADAM-12 levels had limited value as a diagnostic biomarker for EP in our patient cohort. The development of a reliable serum biomarker-based test for EP remains an ongoing challenge."
https://openalex.org/W1984240657,"Background Depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE) at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse is an endocannabinoid-mediated short-term retrograde plasticity. Intracellular Ca2+ elevation is critical for the endocannabinoid production and DSE. Nevertheless, how elevated Ca2+ leads to DSE is unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings We utilized cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2α) knock-out mice and whole-cell patch clamp in cerebellar slices to observed the action of cPLA2α/arachidonic acid signaling on DSE at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse. Our data showed that DSE was significantly inhibited in cPLA2α knock-out mice, which was rescued by arachidonic acid. The degradation enzyme of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), blocked DSE, while another catabolism enzyme for N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), did not affect DSE. These results suggested that 2-AG is responsible for DSE in Purkinje cells. Co-application of paxilline reversed the blockade of DSE by internal K+, indicating that large conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channel (BK) is sufficient to inhibit cPLA2α/arachidonic acid-mediated DSE. In addition, we showed that the release of 2-AG was independent of soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE), protein kinase C and protein kinase A.

Because the pathological changes underlying this disease can begin decades prior to the onset of cognitive impairment, identifying the earliest events in the AD pathological cascade has critical implications for both the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. We previously reported that compared to autopsy confirmed healthy control brain, expression of LR11 (or SorLA) is markedly reduced in AD brain as well as in a subset of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal clinical stage of AD. Recent studies of the LR11 gene SORL1 have suggested that the association between SORL1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and AD risk may not be universal. Therefore, we sought to confirm our earlier findings in a population chosen solely based on clinical criteria, as in most genetic studies. Quantitative immunohistochemistry was used to measure LR11 expression in 43 cases from the Religious Orders Study that were chosen based on a final pre-mortem clinical diagnosis of MCI, mild/moderate AD or no cognitive impairment (NCI). LR11 expression was highly variable in all three diagnostic groups, with no significant group differences. Low LR11 cases were identified using the lowest tertile of LR11 expression observed across all cases as a threshold. Contrary to previous reports, low LR11 expression was found in only 29% of AD cases. A similar proportion of both the MCI and NCI cases also displayed low LR11 expression. AD-associated lesions were present in the majority of cases regardless of diagnostic group, although we found no association between LR11 levels and pathological variables. These findings suggest that the relationship between LR11 expression and the development of AD may be more complicated than originally believed."

In this study, a nuclear export signal (NES) of VP19C is for the first time identified and mapped to amino acid residues 342 to 351. Furthermore, VP19C is demonstrated to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm through the NES in a chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1)-dependent manner involving RanGTP hydrolysis. This makes VP19C the first herpesviral capsid protein with nucleocytoplasmic shuttling property and adds it to the list of HSV-1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins."

Cytochrome c oxidase reduces O2 to H2O, a reaction coupled to proton translocation across the membrane. Therefore, it is necessary to undertake a thorough characterization of the reduced form of the enzyme and the determination of the electron transfer processes and pathways between the redox-active centers. In this study Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and time-resolved step-scan FTIR spectroscopy have been applied to study the fully reduced and mixed valence states of cytochrome ba3 from Thermus thermophilus. We used as probe carbon monoxide (CO) to characterize both thermodynamically and kinetically the cytochrome ba3-CO complex in the 5.25–10.10 pH/pD range and to study the reverse intramolecular electron transfer initiated by the photolysis of CO in the two-electron reduced form. The time-resolved step-scan FTIR data revealed no pH/pD dependence in both the decay of the transient CuB1+-CO complex and rebinding to heme a3 rates, suggesting that no structural change takes place in the vicinity of the binuclear center. Surprisingly, photodissociation of CO from the mixed valence form of the enzyme does not lead to reverse electron transfer from the reduced heme a3 to the oxidized low-spin heme b, as observed in all the other aa3 and bo3 oxidases previously examined. The heme b-heme a3 electron transfer is guaranteed, and therefore, there is no need for structural rearrangements and complex synchronized cooperativities. Comparison among the available structures of ba3- and aa3-cytochrome c oxidases identifies possible active pathways involved in the electron transfer processes and key structural elements that contribute to the different behavior observed in cytochrome ba3.

However, the final heme-heme electron transfer step can be followed through the reverse electron flow between the two hemes, initiated by photolysis of CO from the reduced heme a3 or b3/o3 under conditions where the low-spin heme a or b is initially oxidized. This form of the enzyme can be prepared by overnight exposure of the protein solution to CO gas and through the oxidation of CO to CO2, leading to the so-called mixed valence state where the binuclear center is reduced but the other two electron donor sites (low-spin heme and CuA) remain oxidized (44Brzezinski P. Malmström B.G. The reduction of cytochrome c oxidase by carbon monoxide.FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Binding of CO to heme a3 raises the redox potential of the high-spin heme and traps the electrons at the active site. Photodissociation of CO from the high-spin heme causes the lowering of the heme redox midpoint potential and reverse electron transfer among the redox centers. Studies on aa3 oxidases showed that fast electron equilibration between the two hemes occurs on the nanosecond time scale followed by additional redistribution with time constant of few μs (45Pilet E.

At high pH values the overall process includes an additional ET phase between the hemes, in the millisecond time range, which is coupled to proton transfer through the K-pathway and release of a proton to the bulk medium. Rebinding of CO to high-spin heme induces the back-reactions of electron and proton transfer. This way the reverse ET in various CcOs was determined and found to be from 25 to 35% in Escherichia coli bo3 (47Prutsch A. Vogtt K. Ludovici C. Lübben M.

As a result, cytochrome ba3 is the only documented oxidase where the binding of CO to CuB is exergonic and accounts for 25–30% of the total enzyme concentration (34Koutsoupakis K. Stavrakis S.

Time-resolved step-scan FTIR studies showed that after photolysis of CO from heme a32+, the ligand is almost quantitatively transferred to CuB1+, and the transiently formed CuB1+-CO complex exhibits an unusual long lifetime of 20 ms. The midpoint redox potentials of hemes b and a3 have been reported by two groups and found them inverted, having values of 210/213 and 430/285 mV (versus Normal Hydrogen Electrode), respectively (58Hellwig P.

However, there is no experimental evidence about the active ET pathways that contribute to them and how the observed kinetic and thermodynamic deviations, relative to the mesophilic aa3-type oxidases, are linked to protein structure. This study focuses on two main subjects. The first is to fully characterize the reduced form of the enzyme through the binding of CO in a wide pH/pD range and follow the transient events occurred after the CO-photolysis from heme a3. This way we will reach definite thermodynamic and kinetic conclusions about structural changes that may play a role under physiologically relevant conditions. A time-resolved step-scan FTIR technique is a sensitive probe able to monitor these transient and/or labile structures. The second is to use FTIR spectroscopy to follow the possible intramolecular electron transfer between the redox-active centers in ba3-cytochrome c oxidase from T. thermophilus. The property of selectively reducing the heme a3-CuB binuclear site by the inhibitor CO permits the measurement of the rate constants of the individual ET reactions through the extent of the reverse electron transfer induced by the photodissociation of CO from heme a3 Fe2+. Surprisingly, photolysis of CO from heme a3 does not result in reverse electron transfer from the heme a3 to the low spin heme b, as it has been observed in all other heme-copper oxidases previously examined. Furthermore, comparison between the equilibrium fully-reduced and -mixed valence spectra suggests that the proposed CuA-CuB direct electron transfer pathway is not active in the reverse (bac"

However, no reduction was observed in mice infected with a closely related Gram-negative pneumonic organism (Klebsiella pneumoniae) suggesting the inhibition may be Francisella-specific. In similar fashion to in vivo observations, addition of Francisella lysate to exogenous alkaline phosphatase (tissue-nonspecific isozyme) was inhibitory. Partial purification and subsequent proteomic analysis indicated the inhibitory factor to be the heat shock protein DnaK. Incubation with increasing amounts of anti-DnaK antibody reduced the inhibitory effect in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, DnaK contains an adenosine triphosphate binding domain at its N terminus, and addition of adenosine triphosphate enhances dissociation of DnaK with its target protein, e.g. alkaline phosphatase. Addition of adenosine triphosphate resulted in decreased DnaK co-immunoprecipitated with alkaline phosphatase as well as reduction of Francisella-mediated alkaline phosphatase inhibition further supporting the binding of Francisella DnaK to alkaline phosphatase. Release of DnaK via secretion and/or bacterial cell lysis into the extracellular milieu and inhibition of plasma alkaline phosphatase could promote an orchestrated, inflammatory response advantageous to Francisella.
