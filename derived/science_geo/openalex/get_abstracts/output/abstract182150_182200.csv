Biochemical and functional analyses identified muramyl dipeptide (MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln) derived from peptidoglycan as the essential structure in bacteria recognized by NOD2. Replacement of l-Ala for d-Ala ord-isoGln for l-isoGln eliminated the ability of muramyl dipeptide to stimulate NOD2, indicating stereoselective recognition. Muramyl dipeptide was recognized by NOD2 but not by TLR2 or co-expression of TLR2 with TLR1 or TLR6. NOD2 mutants associated with susceptibility to Crohn's disease were deficient in their recognition of muramyl dipeptide. Notably, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals homozygous for the major disease-associated L1007fsinsC NOD2 mutation responded to lipopolysaccharide but not to synthetic muramyl dipeptide. Thus, NOD2 mediates the host response to bacterial muropeptides derived from peptidoglycan, an activity that is important for protection against Crohn's disease. Because muramyl dipeptide is the essential structure of peptidoglycan required for adjuvant activity, these results also have implications for understanding adjuvant function and effective vaccine development.

Innate immunity recognizes invading microbes and triggers a defense response in the host aimed at clearing the invading pathogen.

Akira S. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 733-742Google Scholar). Each membrane-associated TLR recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns that are expressed on infectious agents (1Takeda K. Akira S. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 733-742Google Scholar). Nods, including NOD1 and NOD2, are members of another family of proteins that have been recently implicated in intracellular recognition of bacterial components (2Inohara N. Ogura T. Nuñez G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 76-80Google Scholar, 3Girardin S.E. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 193-199Google Scholar). NOD2 is composed of two NH2-terminal caspase-recruitment domains, a centrally located nucleotide-binding domain and multiple COOH-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), and is expressed in myelomonocytic and dendritic cells (4Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Google Scholar, 5Gutierrez O. Pipaon C. Inohara N. Fontalba A. Ogura Y. Prosper F. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41701-47705Google Scholar). Three genetic variants within the coding region of NOD2, L1007fsinsC, G908R, and R702W, have been genetically associated with susceptibility to Crohn's disease in European and American populations (6Hugot J.P. Chamaillard M. Zouali H. Lesage S. Cezard J.P. Belaiche J. Almer S. Tysk C. O'Morain C.A. Gassull M. Binder V. Finkel Y. Cortot A. Modigliani R. Laurent-Puig P. Gower-Rousseau C. Macry J.

Jewell D.P. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 854-866Google Scholar). NOD2 has been shown to recognize preparations of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN) through its COOH-terminal LRRs (10Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Google Scholar), and this activity is deficient in the disease-associated variants (7Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H. Moran T. Karaliuskas R. Duerr R.H. Achkar J.P. Brant S.R. Bayless T.M. Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nuñez G. Cho J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 603-606Google Scholar). However, the precise bacterial structure recognized by NOD2 remains unknown. In this report we identified muramyl dipeptide (MDP) derived from peptidoglycan as the structure in bacteria recognized by NOD2. LPS from Escherichia coli O55:B5 prepared by the phenol extraction method, further purified by gel-filtration chromatography, detoxified LPS, and purified lipid A were obtained from Sigma. LPS from Salmonella typhimurium was obtained from Sigma. PGN from Staphylococcus aureus was from Fluka-Chemie (Buchs, Germany). PGN fromBacillus subtilis was purified as reported (11Hajjar A.M. O'Mahony D.S. Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Klebanoff S.J. Wilson C.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 166: 15-19Google Scholar). Pam3CysSerLys4, a synthetic bacterial lipoprotein analog (sBLP), was a gift of A. Zychlinsky (Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin, Germany). MDP and their analogs MurNAc-l-alanyl-l-isoglutamine and MurNAc-d-alanyl-d-isoglutamine were obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Molecules with two and four copies of GlcNAc-MurNAc attached to l-Ala-d-isoGln, and their counterparts lacking dipeptide were synthesized as reported (12Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329Google Scholar). Briefly, the disaccharide glucosaminyl-β (1Takeda K. Akira S. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 733-742Google Scholar, 2Inohara N. Ogura T. Nuñez G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 76-80Google Scholar, 3Girardin S.E. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Google Scholar)-muramic acid was prepared by stereoselective glycosylation of an N-Troc muramic acid acceptor with N-Troc-glucosaminyl trichloroacetimidate. The disaccharide was converted to both disaccharide acceptor and donor, which was then coupled together by the same glycosylation method to give a tetrasaccharide. Octasaccharide was obtained in a good yield in a similar manner. Introduction of the dipeptide moiety ofl-alanyl-d-isoglutamine to 3-O-lactyl groups was performed by deprotection afforded by the peptidoglycan tetrasaccharide and octasaccharide fragments. The plasmids pcDNA3- NOD2, pcDNA3-TLR4, and pDNA3-MD2 have been described (10Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Google Scholar). The plasmids expressing TLR1 and TLR6 have been reported (13Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Google Scholar) and were generously provided by Dr. A. Hajjar (University of Washington, Seattle). Expression plasmids producing NH2-terminal HA-tagged NOD2 variants P268S, P268S/R702W, and P268S/G908R were generated by the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). P268S/L1007fsinsC was generated by a PCR method using P268S DNA as a template. The generated PCR products were cloned into the pMX-puro expression plasmid (14Atrih A. Bacher G. Allmaier G. Williamson M.P. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3956-3962Google Scholar). The authenticity of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression of NOD2 proteins in transfected cells was determined by immunoblotting using monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Babco, La Jolla, CA) as described (5Gutierrez O. Pipaon C. Inohara N. Fontalba A. Ogura Y. Prosper F. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41701-47705Google Scholar). NF-κB activation assays were performed as described (10Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Google Scholar). LPS, PGN, and MDP derivaties were added to the cultures in the presence of calcium phosphate to allow their entry into the cells as reported (10Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Google Scholar). Results were normalized for transfection efficiency with values obtained with pEF-BOS-βgal. Expression of NOD2 proteins in transfected cells was determined by immunoblotting using monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Babco, La Jolla, CA) as described (4Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Google Scholar). PGN from B. subtilus (0.4 mg) was digested with mutanolysin (Sigma) for 24 h. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min and filtration with a 0.22-μm nitrocellulose filter, digested PGN was fractionated by Superose 12 gel-filtration column chromatography with 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Purified bovine serum albumine, chicken egg lysozyme, and bovine cytochromec were used as molecular size standards. Peripheral blood was obtained from normal donors and Crohn's disease patients after informed consent according to Guidelines from the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla. DNA was tested for the 3020insC NOD2 mutation using the SNaPshot method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) based on the dideoxy single-base extension of an unlabeled oligonucleotide primer (5′-GCCCTCCTGCAGGCCC-3′). PBMNC were cultured for 1 h with 1 μg/ml LPS from S. typhimuriumor 10 ng/ml MDP. Then cells were lysed and nuclear extracts were analyzed for the presence of NF-κB binding activity as described previously (5Gutierrez O. Pipaon C. Inohara N. Fontalba A. Ogura Y. Prosper F. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41701-47705Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). To assess mRNA expression, a quantitative PCR method was used as described previously (5Gutierrez O. Pipaon C. Inohara N. Fontalba A. Ogura Y. Prosper F. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41701-47705Google Scholar). The generated cDNA was amplified by using primers for human IL-1β, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (5Gutierrez O. Pipaon C. Inohara N. Fontalba A. Ogura Y. Prosper F. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41701-47705Google Scholar), and A1 (5′-CGGATGTGGATACCTATAAGG-3′ and 5′-GTCATCCAGCCAGATTTAGG-3′). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in a 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The ratio of the abundance of IL-1β and A1 transcripts to that of GAPDH transcripts was calculated as described (5Gutierrez O. Pipaon C. Inohara N. Fontalba A. Ogura Y. Prosper F. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41701-47705Google Scholar). Specificity of the PCR products was determined by melting curve analysis. NOD2 was shown to mediate responsiveness to preparations of LPS and PGN (10Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Google Scholar). To further characterize the bacterial moiety recognized by NOD2, we used human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells and a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter to compare the ability of NOD2 and TLR4 to recognize LPS and PGN. Because NOD2 is an intracellular protein, we assessed NOD2 activity under culture conditions that allow the internalization of the bacterial components into the cells (10Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Google Scholar). Expression of NOD2 and TLR4 together with its co-factor MD2 conferred responsiveness to purified LPS prepared by phenol extraction as reported (7Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H. Moran T. Karaliuskas R. Duerr R.H. Achkar J.P. Brant S.R. Bayless T.M. Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nuñez G. Cho J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 603-606Google Scholar, 10Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Google Scholar), whereas only NOD2 induced the response to PGN (Fig. 1 A). The lipid A moiety of LPS mediates TLR4/MD2 activation (15Glauner B. Höltje J.-V. Schwartz U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10088-10095Google Scholar). Consistent with the latter, NOD2, but not TLR4, did respond to lipid A-depleted detoxified LPS prepared by alkaline treatment (Fig. 1 A), whereas TLR4, but not NOD2, responded to purified lipid A (Fig.1 A). Notably, TLR4, but not NOD2, was stimulated by highly purified LPS prepared by gel-filtration chromatography (Fig.1 A). These results indicate that TLR4 and NOD2 recognize different bacterial components and suggest that PGN present in LPS preparations may contain the moiety recognized by NOD2. To further characterize the bacterial structure recognized by NOD2, we digested purified PGN with the muramidases mutanolysin or Cellosyl, which degrade the glycan chains and result in the generation of muropeptides which are composed of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) andN-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) linked to short peptides (16Inamura S. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Tetrahedron Lett. 2001; 42: 7613-7619Google Scholar). Digested PGN was fractionated by gel-filtration chromatography. Analysis of each fraction revealed a major peak of NOD2-stimulating activity induced by mutanolysin digestion with a relative molecular mass of less than 12 kDa, consistent with that expected for muropeptides (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were observed when PGN was digested with Cellosyl, which revealed a single peak of NOD2 stimulatory activity of less than 12 kDa. 2N. Inohara, Y. Ogura, and G. Nuñez, unpublished results. PGN-derived muropeptides derived from most bacterial species are composed of GlcNAc-MurNAc linked to short peptides, which include the conserved dipeptide l-Ala and d-isoGln ord-Glu (Fig. 2 A). To determine more directly if muropeptides are recognized by NOD2, we used a panel of synthetic molecules with the structure of GlcNAc-MurNAc linked to l-Ala-d-isoGln, as well as muramyl dipeptide MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln (MDP), which lacks GlcNAc (Fig. 2 A). GlcNAc-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoGln stimulated NF-κB in a NOD2-dependent manner, whereas disaccharide GlcNAc-MurNAc in dimeric or tetrameric forms did not (Fig.2 B), indicating that amino acid residues are required for stimulation of NOD2. However, we cannot formally rule out that the lack of NOD2 response to GlcNAc-MurNAc in dimeric or tetrameric forms is due to poor internalization of the synthetic molecules into the cells. MDP induced potent stimulation of NOD2 (Fig. 2 B), indicating that GlcNAc is not essential for stimulatory activity. To determine further the specificity of the recognition of MDP by NOD2, we tested the MDP analogs MurNAc-l-Ala-l-isoGln and MurNAc-d-Ala-d-isoGln. Notably, replacement ofl-Ala for d-Ala or d-isoGln forl-isoGln eliminated the ability of MDP to stimulate NOD2, indicating stereoselective recognition (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the core structure required for recognition of NOD2 is MurNAc attached tol-Ala and d-isoGln. TLR2 has been proposed to act as a surface receptor for PGN and certain bacterial lipoproteins including synthetic bacterial lipopeptide (sBLP) (17Aliprantis A.O. Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Suggett S. Devaux B. Radolf J.D. Klimpel G.R. Godowski P. Zychlinsky A. Science. 1999; 285: 736-739Google Scholar, 18Lee H.K. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4012-4017Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of TLR2 and NOD2 to respond to MDP and sBLP. TLR2 mediated a cellular response to sBLP but not to MDP (Fig.2 D). Conversely, MDP, but not sBLP, stimulated NOD2 activity (Fig. 2 D). In addition, we tested whether co-expression of TLR2 with TLR1 and/or TLR6 could mediate recognition of MDP. TLR2 in combination with TLR1, TLR6, or TLR1/TLR6 did not activate NF-κB in response to MDP (Fig. 2 D). Thus, NOD2 and TLR2 recognize different bacterial structures. The NOD2 variants associated with Crohn's disease, R702W, G908R, and L1007fsinsC, occur on the same haplotype background, which includes the common P268S polymorphism (6Hugot J.P. Chamaillard M. Zouali H. Lesage S. Cezard J.P. Belaiche J. Almer S. Tysk C. O'Morain C.A. Gassull M. Binder V. Finkel Y. Cortot A. Modigliani R. Laurent-Puig P. Gower-Rousseau C. Macry J. Colombel J.F. Sahbatou M.

Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nuñez G. Cho J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 603-606Google Scholar). To compare the ability of normal and mutant NOD2 proteins to induce NF-κB activity in response to MDP, we expressed the NOD2 proteins in cells and evaluated their activity in a functional assay. Both normal and P268S NOD2 induced similar levels of NF-κB activation in response to MDP (Fig.3 A), which is consistent with the observation that P268S is not genetically associated with disease (6Hugot J.P. Chamaillard M. Zouali H. Lesage S. Cezard J.P. Belaiche J. Almer S. Tysk C. O'Morain C.A. Gassull M. Binder V. Finkel Y. Cortot A. Modigliani R. Laurent-Puig P. Gower-Rousseau C. Macry J. Colombel J.F. Sahbatou M. Thomas G. Nature. 2001; 411: 599-603Google Scholar, 7Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H. Moran T. Karaliuskas R. Duerr R.H. Achkar J.P. Brant S.R. Bayless T.M. Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nuñez G. Cho J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 603-606Google Scholar). In contrast, the P268S/R702W, P268S/G908R, and P268S/L1007fsinsC variants induced greatly reduced levels of NF-κB activation in response to MDP when compared with normal NOD2 (Fig.3 A). Notably, whereas the P268S/R702W and P268S/R702W point mutants retained some ability to respond to MDP, the truncated P268/L1007fsinsC protein did not respond at all concentrations of NOD2 and MDP tested (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblotting analysis revealed that the normal and NOD2 mutants were appropriately expressed (Fig.3 B), indicating that the observed differences in MDP responses could not be explained by differential expression of the NOD2 constructs. We next determined the role of NOD2 in the recognition of MDP by primary cells from normal and Crohn's disease patients. A panel of healthy and Crohn's disease individuals were genotyped for the disease-associated NOD2 alleles, and two individuals (one without clinical evidence of disease and one individual with Crohn's disease) who were homozygous for the loss-of-function L1007fsinsC mutation were identified. The identification of apparently healthy individuals homozygous for L1007fsinsC is expected in that the penetrance of the L1007fsinsC mutation is not complete (6Hugot J.P. Chamaillard M. Zouali H. Lesage S. Cezard J.P. Belaiche J. Almer S. Tysk C. O'Morain C.A. Gassull M. Binder V. Finkel Y. Cortot A. Modigliani R. Laurent-Puig P. Gower-Rousseau C. Macry J. Colombel J.F. Sahbatou M. Thomas G.

Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 854-866Google Scholar). PBMNC that are known to express NOD2 were isolated, incubated with MDP or LPS, and NF-κB activation was assessed in nuclear extracts by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Stimulation of PBMNC from individuals carrying normal or heterozygous NOD2 alleles with either LPS or MDP resulted in induction of the NF-κB-DNA complex (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, PBMNC from individuals homozygous for L1007fsinsC did respond to LPS, but not to MDP (Fig. 3 C). The DNA binding complex induced by MDP was shifted by incubation of the nuclear extracts with an antibody specific for the p50 subunit of NF-κB (Fig.3 C), indicating that the detected protein-DNA complex contained NF-κB. To further assess NF-κB activation, the mRNA levels of IL-1β and A1, two NF-κB target genes expressed in PBMNC (19Cogswell J.P. Godlevski M.M. Wisely G.B. Clay W.C. Leesnitzer L.M. Ways J.P. Gray J.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 712-723Google Scholar, 20Zong W.X. Edelstein L.C. Chen C. Bash J. Gelinas C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 382-387Google Scholar), were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Both IL-1β and A1 mRNA levels were induced by incubation with LPS and MDP in cells from individuals carrying normal or heterozygous NOD2 alleles (Fig. 3, D and E). In contrast, LPS but not MDP, increased the levels of both IL-1β and A1 mRNA in PBMNC from individuals homozygous for L1007fsinsC (Fig. 3, D andE). Thus, PBMNC require the expression of normal NOD2 for their response to MDP but not to LPS. The lack of response to MDP in apparently normal individuals suggest that the presence of certain bacteria in the intestine and/or additional genetic factors may be required for clinical disease. MDP is the minimal essential structure of bacterial peptidoglycan required for biological effects, including activity in Freund's complete adjuvant (21Takada H. Kotani S. Stewart D.E.S. The Theory and Practical Application of Adjuvants. Wiley, Chichester, UK1995: 171-202Google Scholar). MDP has been shown to signal through TLR2- and TLR4-independent mechanisms (22Yang S. Tamai R. Akashi S. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Sugawara S. Takada H. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2045-2053Google Scholar, 23Wolfert M.A. Murray T.F. Boons G.-J. Moore J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39179Google Scholar), but the host recognition system for MDP has not been identified. We present evidence that NOD2 mediates the recognition of MDP in mammalian cells. Macrophages contain intracellular hydrolases that digest bacterial PGN and release PGN fragments including GlcNAc-MurNAc-dipeptide (24Johannsen L. Wecke J. Obal Jr., F. Krueger J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R126-R133Google Scholar, 25Vermeulen M.W. Gray G.R. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 476-483Google Scholar). These muropeptides derived from intracellular and/or phagocytosed bacteria as well as PGN fragments released during bacterial growth would be available for recognition by NOD2. The synthetic MDP and GlcNAc-MurNAc-dipeptides mimicking the natural muropeptides induced NOD2-dependent activation of NF-κB. Thus, NOD2 is likely to be activated by muropeptides derived from bacteria in vivo. Although NOD2 can mediate the recognition of muropeptides, the mechanism involved is unclear and remains to be determined. Because the LRRs are required for recognition, muropeptides could interact directly with NOD2 through its LRRs or via as yet to be identified cellular factor(s). Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 variants and PBMNC from individuals homozygous for L1007fsinsC are defective in their response to muramyl dipeptide. This result is consistent with the observation that homozygocity for L1007fsinsC is needed for susceptibility to Crohn's disease (6Hugot J.P. Chamaillard M. Zouali H. Lesage S. Cezard J.P.

Because activation of NF-κB in response to bacterial components mediates protection of the host against pathogens, NOD2-mediated susceptibility to disease may be caused by a failure to trigger a protective NF-κB pathway in response to muropeptides. Such a defective response against certain bacterial products may result secondarily in the diffuse activation of NF-κB found in intestinal tissue by NOD2-independent mechanisms. The results presented here suggest that restoring the activity against bacterial muropeptides may be beneficial to Crohn's disease patients harboring NOD2 mutations. We are grateful to T.

https://openalex.org/W2122433970,"Although tissue factor (TF), the principial initiator of physiological coagulation and pathological thrombosis, has recently been proposed to be present in human blood, the functional significance and location of the intravascular TF is unknown. In the plasma portion of blood, we found TF to be mainly associated with circulating microvesicles. By cell sorting with the specific marker CD42b, platelet-derived microvesicles were identified as a major location of the plasma TF. This was confirmed by the presence of full-length TF in microvesicles acutely shedded from the activated platelets. TF was observed to be stored in the alpha-granules and the open canalicular system of resting platelets and to be exposed on the cell surface after platelet activation. Functional competence of the blood-based TF was enabled when the microvesicles and platelets adhered to neutrophils, as mediated by P-selectin and neutrophil counterreceptor (PSGL-1, CD18 integrins) interactions. Moreover, neutrophil-secreted oxygen radical species supported the intravascular TF activity. The pools of platelet and microvesicle TF contributed additively and to a comparable extent to the overall blood TF activity, indicating a substantial participation of the microvesicle TF. Our results introduce a new concept of TF-mediated coagulation crucially dependent on TF associated with microvesicles and activated platelets, which principally enables the entire coagulation system to proceed on a restricted cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W2016498752,"We demonstrate that in humans, two metalloproteases, ADAMTS-9 (1935 amino acids) and ADAMTS-20 (1911 amino acids) are orthologs of GON-1, an ADAMTS protease required for gonadal morphogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. ADAMTS-9 and ADAMTS-20 have an identical modular structure, are distinct in possessing 15 TSRs and a unique C-terminal domain, and have a similar gene structure, suggesting that they comprise a new subfamily of human ADAMTS proteases. ADAMTS20 is very sparingly expressed, although it is detectable in epithelial cells of the breast and lung. However, ADAMTS9 is highly expressed in embryonic and adult tissues, and therefore we characterized the ADAMTS-9 protein further. Although the ADAMTS-9 zymogen has many proprotein convertase processing sites, pulse-chase analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and amino acid sequencing demonstrated that maturation to the active form occurs by selective proprotein convertase (e.g. furin) cleavage of the Arg287–Phe288 bond. Although lacking a transmembrane sequence, ADAMTS-9 is retained near the cell surface as well as in the ECM of transiently transfected COS-1 and 293 cells. COS-1 cells transfected with ADAMTS9 (but not vector-transfected cells) proteolytically cleaved bovine versican and aggrecan core proteins at the Glu441–Ala442bond of versican V1 and the Glu1771–Ala1772bond of aggrecan, respectively. In contrast, the ADAMTS-9 catalytic domain alone was neither localized to the cell surface nor able to confer these proteolytic activities on cells, demonstrating that the ancillary domains of ADAMTS-9, including the TSRs, are required both for specific extracellular localization and for its versicanase and aggrecanase activities.

The ADAMTS (Adisintegrin-likeand metalloprotease (reprolysin type) withthrombospondin type I motif) family consists of secreted zinc metalloproteases with a precisely ordered modular organization that includes at least one thrombospondin type I repeat (TSR) 1The abbreviations used are: TSR, thrombospondin type I repeat; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; ORF, open reading frame; RT, reverse transcriptase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1Hurskainen T.L.

Altogether, 19 human ADAMTS symbols identifying 18 distinct genes and their products have been assigned (note that ADAMTS5 (1Hurskainen T.L. Hirohata S. Seldin M.F. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25555-25563Google Scholar) and ADAMTS11 (4Abbaszade I. Liu R.Q. Yang F. Rosenfeld S.A. Ross O.H. Link J.R. Ellis D.M. Tortorella M.D. Pratta M.A. Hollis J.M. Wynn R. Duke J.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23443-23450Google Scholar) designate the same gene). 2Gene nomenclature (ADAMTS9 andADAMTS20) was assigned after consultation with the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee. Adamts9 and Adamts20are the respective mouse orthologs. The protein products of these genes are designated as ADAMTS-9 and ADAMTS-20. Similar nomenclature is used for other ADAMTS genes and their products. GON-1 refers to the product of the C. elegans gon-1 gene. ADAMTS are also present in invertebrates, which contain fewer ADAMTS genes than mammalian genomes. A Caenorhabditis elegansADAMTS gene, gon-1, has an essential role in reproduction (16Blelloch R. Anna-Arriola S.S. Gao D. Li Y. Hodgkin J. Kimble J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 382-393Google Scholar). The protease (GON-1) encoded by gon-1 is required for migration of distal tip cells during gonadal morphogenesis. It may have a role in degradation of basement membrane or for processing of extracellular cues required for cell migration (16Blelloch R. Anna-Arriola S.S. Gao D. Li Y. Hodgkin J. Kimble J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 382-393Google Scholar). GON-1 is the largest of all ADAMTS enzymes described to date and contains 18 TSRs (16Blelloch R. Anna-Arriola S.S. Gao D. Li Y. Hodgkin J. Kimble J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 382-393Google Scholar). In addition, it has a presumed globular domain at the C terminus without similarity to known proteins. Human ADAMTS-9, as previously described (17Clark M.E. Kelner G.S. Turbeville L.A. Boyer A. Arden K.C. Maki R.A. Genomics. 2000; 67: 343-350Google Scholar) contains four TSRs. Despite being a much smaller enzyme than GON-1, it had greater sequence similarity to it than to any other human ADAMTS (17Clark M.E. Kelner G.S. Turbeville L.A. Boyer A. Arden K.C. Maki R.A. Genomics. 2000; 67: 343-350Google Scholar). Here, we characterize a considerably longer form of ADAMTS-9 (designated ADAMTS-9B, but referred to subsequently in this paper as ADAMTS-9) that we propose is the authentic full-length product of ADAMTS9. In addition, we have discovered a novel enzyme, ADAMTS-20, and determined its complete primary sequence. ADAMTS-9 and ADAMTS-20 have an identical domain organization and exon structure and a very similar primary sequence, showing that they comprise a distinct subfamily of GON-1-related ADAMTS proteases in the mammalian genome. We have characterized the zymogen maturation and cellular localization of the more highly expressed of these two proteins, ADAMTS-9, and have investigated its role in proteolysis of the large aggregating proteoglycans versican and aggrecan. Our data demonstrate the critical requirement of the ancillary domains for the proteolytic function and localization of ADAMTS-9. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) programs from the National Center for Biotechnology Information were used to search the data base of expressed sequence tags (dBEST), using the protein sequences of ADAMTS proteases previously discovered by us (1Hurskainen T.L. Hirohata S. Seldin M.F. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25555-25563Google Scholar, 18Georgiadis K.E. Hirohata S. Seldin M.F. Apte S.S. Genomics. 1999; 62: 312-315Google Scholar). To extend the initially identified ADAMTS9 cDNA to the 5′-end, human chondrocyte, muscle, heart, or fetal brain mRNA (Marathon cDNA, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used as the template for rapid amplification of cDNA ends as previously described (1Hurskainen T.L. Hirohata S. Seldin M.F. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25555-25563Google Scholar). To confirm that the overlapping cDNA clones obtained represented a contiguous mRNA, the complete ORF was amplified by PCR. The oligonucleotide primers 5′-AAGCGGCCGCACCATGCAGTTTGTATCC-3′ (NotI site underlined and start codon italicized) and 5′-CTCGAGAATAAAACTCGCACCTCCAGGC-3′ (XhoI site underlined and modified stop codon italicized) were used for PCR with human fetal skeletal muscle cDNA as template and Advantage 2 polymerase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The 5.8-kb PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced completely. cDNA cloning ofAdamts9 will be reported elsewhere. 3K. A. Jungers and S. S. Apte, unpublished data. To ask whether there existed additional ADAMTS proteases with a domain organization similar to GON-1 and ADAMTS-9, the human genome sequence (Celera, Rockville, MD) was searched using the amino acid sequence of the unique C-terminal domain of ADAMTS-9. GENSCAN (available on the World Wide Web at genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html) analysis of genomic DNA upstream and downstream of the initially identified ADAMTS20sequence was used to identify putative ADAMTS20 exons. Oligonucleotide primers based on the sequences of these putativeADAMTS20 exons were used for PCR spanning adjacent exons using cDNA derived from the human K562 (erythroleukemia) and A549 (lung cancer) cell lines. The exon-intron structures of ADAMTS9 andADAMTS20 were deduced by comparison of the respective cDNAs with human genome sequences using BLAST searches of private (Celera) and public (GenBankTM) databases. Multiple tissue northern blots containing 1 μg/lane poly(A+) RNA from mouse embryos and individual adult mouse and human tissues (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were hybridized to [α-32P]dCTP-labeled ADAMTS9,ADAMTS20, or Adamts9 probes, followed by autoradiographic exposure for 3–7 days. cDNA panels derived from human adult and fetal organs normalized with respect toGAPDH mRNA levels were purchased from Clontech. Real time PCR of these cDNA templates was performed in an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector using SYBR Green PCR Core Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as previously described (12Fernandes R.J. Hirohata S. Engle J.M. Colige A. Cohn D.H. Eyre D.R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31502-31509Google Scholar). PCR amplifications were performed in triplicate for all templates, along with parallel measurements of GAPDHcDNA for normalization. The GAPDH-normalized quantitative data forADAMTS9 and ADAMTS20 were used to determine theADAMTS9/ADAMTS20 transcript ratio in all templates examined. The following primers were used for amplification at a concentration of 300 nm each: ADAMTS9forward, 5′-GGACAAGCGAAGGACATCC-3′; ADAMTS9 reverse, 5′-ATCCATCCATAATGGCTTCC-3′; ADAMTS20 forward, 5-GGTGGCATGTTATTGGCAAAA-3′; ADAMTS20 reverse, 5′-CACAGTTACCATGGCATAGTTCTTG-3′; GAPDH primers were described previously (12Fernandes R.J. Hirohata S. Engle J.M. Colige A. Cohn D.H. Eyre D.R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31502-31509Google Scholar). RT-PCR performed in the absence of template was negative with all primer pairs. RNA in situ hybridization was performed essentially as previously described (19Albrecht U. Eichele G. Helms J.A. Lu H.C. Daston G.P. Molecular and Cellular Methods in Developmental Toxicology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1997: 23-48Google Scholar), using 35S-labeled antisense and sense cRNA probes transcribed from a 600-nt cDNA template encoding the unique domain of ADAMTS-20. Normal human breast and lung samples as well as samples of squamous cell carcinoma of breast and adenocarcinoma of lung were obtained under a Cleveland Clinic Foundation Institutional Review Board-approved protocol and fixed in formalin (tissue samples were provided by the Cooperative Human Tissue Network). 5-μm-thick paraffin sections were hybridized to the probes prior to dipping in photographic emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.) and followed by autoradiographic exposure for 7 days. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. TheADAMTS9 cDNA was excised as aNotI-XhoI fragment and cloned into theNotI and SalI sites of pFLAG-CMV-5a (Sigma) to introduce an in-frame C-terminal FLAG tag (ADAMTS-9FLAG). For expression of ADAMTS-91–508 (the signal peptide, prodomain, and catalytic domain), PCR amplification was done using the same forward primer as for the full-length ADAMTS9 cDNA, the reverse primer 5′-AACTCGAGTTAGGCAAAGGGTAGGGTCTG-3′ (XhoI site underlined), and fetal heart cDNA (Clontech) as template. The resulting amplicon was cloned in pFLAG-CMV-5a (Sigma) and pcDNA3.1 MYC/HIS B+ (Invitrogen) to generate proteins with in-frame C-terminal FLAG ormyc-His tags, respectively, ADAMTS-91–508FLAG, and ADAMTS-91–508MYC/HIS. Site-directed mutagenesis of the convertase (e.g. furin) sites (Arg33 → Ala, Arg74 → Ala, Arg280 → Ala, and Arg287 → Ala) in ADAMTS-91–508MYC/HISwas done using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The insert of the KIAA0688 gene (20Ishikawa K. Nagase T. Suyama M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 169-176Google Scholar) encoding ADAMTS-4 (3Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A. Copeland R.A. Decicco C.P. Wynn R. Rockwell A.

Arner E.C. et al.Science. 1999; 284: 1664-1666Google Scholar) in pBluescript SK (Stratagene) was excised with EcoRI andXhoI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3.1MYC/HIS A- (Invitrogen) to generate a mammalian expression vector producing untagged ADAMTS-4. The ADAMTS4 andADAMTS5 ORFs from the convertase-processing site to the stop codon were PCR-amplified and cloned into p3XFLAG-CMV-9 (Sigma) for expression in frame with a preprotrypsin leader sequence and three tandem FLAG tags present just downstream of the signal peptidase cleavage site. These proteins are therefore secreted with N-terminal FLAG tag (3×FLAGADAMTS-4 or 3×FLAGADAMTS-5). All expression plasmids and site-directed mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. COS-1 and 293-HEK cells were maintained and transfected with ADAMTS-9FLAG, ADAMTS-91–508FLAG,3×FLAGADAMTS-4, or 3×FLAGADAMTS-5, as described previously (21Hirohata S. Wang L.W. Miyagi M. Yan L. Seldin M.F. Keene D.R. Crabb J.W. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 22: 22Google Scholar). Transfected cell lysates and culture medium were harvested separately after 48 h and were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using the FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). For immunolocalization of extracellular ADAMTS-9FLAG, ADAMTS-91–508FLAG,3×FLAGADAMTS-4, and 3×FLAGADAMTS-5, cells were stained with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody 48 h post-transfection without permeabilization as previously described (21Hirohata S. Wang L.W. Miyagi M. Yan L. Seldin M.F. Keene D.R. Crabb J.W. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 22: 22Google Scholar). Alternatively, transfected cells were stained following fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (staining with permeabilization). Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. As controls, COS-1 and 293 cells were transfected with the empty FLAG vector alone, followed by the immunostaining procedure, or the primary antibody was omitted for FLAG staining. To release ADAMTS-9 from the cell surface, transfected 293 cells and ECM were harvested by scraping and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2.7 mmKCl, 137 mm NaCl). Cells and ECM were gently agitated by end-over end rotation in PBS alone or in PBS plus 100 mm or 200 mm NaCl at 4 °C for 30 min. 508MYC/HIS Purification and Analysis—To obtain stably transfected 293 cells expressing ADAMTS-91–508MYC/HIS, selection with G418 (750 μg/ml) was applied after transfection, and selected clones were maintained in culture medium containing 5% serum and 250 μg/ml G418. Conditioned medium was dialyzed into binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.03% Brij-35 (Sigma)) prior to binding on a 5-ml Ni2+-Sepharose column (ProBond™; Invitrogen). The column was washed with 3 column volumes of binding buffer. A gradient of 0–42.5 mm imidazole in binding buffer was used to remove nonspecifically bound molecules from the column. Stepwise elution was done using one-column volume batches of 0–250 mm imidazole in binding buffer. Elution was monitored by Western blotting using antibody 9E10. The majority of protein was determined to elute at 50 mm imidazole. ADAMTS-91–508MYC/HIS was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and lightly stained with modified Coomassie Blue (Simply Blue Safe Stain; Invitrogen). The 28-kDa band was excised and subjected to Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Procise 492 sequencer in the Molecular Biotechnology Core Facility of the Lerner Research Institute. Deglycosylation of lysate and conditioned medium from ADAMTS-91–508FLAG-transfected cells was done using 10 units of PNGase F (Roche Molecular Biosciences) for 3 h at 37 °C in 150 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 as described below. Stably transfected cells were cultured with and without tunicamycin A homolog (Sigma) as previously described (21Hirohata S. Wang L.W. Miyagi M. Yan L. Seldin M.F. Keene D.R. Crabb J.W. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 22: 22Google Scholar), followed by Western blotting of conditioned medium and cell lysates. Unless specified, reagents were purchased from Sigma. QBI 293A cells (Quantum Biotechnologies, Montreal, Canada) were maintained in complete DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected with ADAMTS-91–508FLAG or ADAMTS-91–508MYC/HISusing Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biosciences). 24 h following transfection, cells were washed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Met/Cys-free medium (MEM SelectAmine kit; Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS, 1 mmglutamine, and a [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture (EXPRE35S35S™; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A 15- or 30-min labeling (pulse) was followed by incubation in complete nonradioactive medium (chase) for the indicated times. The cell layer was washed with PBS, and cells were lysed with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 4 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1 μmaprotinin, 10 μm pepstatin, 10 μmleupeptin, and 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were centrifuged to remove insoluble material. FLAG M2 antibody or penta-His antibody (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) was added to cell lysate and medium followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads were added and incubated with samples for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer, and labeled proteins were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE. Gels were treated with ENTENSIFY reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and exposed for fluorography. CHO.RPE 40 cells (22Spence M.J. Sucic J.F. Foley B.T. Moehring T.J. Somat. Cell. Mol. Genet. 1995; 21: 1-18Google Scholar) were maintained as previously described (32Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Milchanowski A.B. Dufour E.K. Leduc R. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33471-33479Google Scholar). They were transfected with ADAMTS-91–508MYC/HIS alone or in combination with furin. QBI 293A cells were transiently transfected either with ADAMTS- 91–508MYC/HIS, or its derivatives obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. Cells were metabolically labeled as above for 3 h, and immunoprecipitation and fluorography were done as above. Versican monomer (a mixture of the V1 and V0 forms) was isolated from bovine aorta, as previously described (8Sandy J.D. Westling J. Kenagy R.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Verscharen C. Rodriguez-Mazaneque J.C. Zimmermann D.R. Lemire J.M. Fischer J.W. Wight T.N. Clowes A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13372-13378Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with ADAMTS-9FLAG, ADAMTS-91–508FLAG, or ADAMTS-4 expression plasmids or with empty vector pFLAG-CMV-5a (as negative control) in six-well plates in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells from a single well were used for each experiment. 48 h after transfection, cells were scraped off and suspended in serum-free DMEM followed by six washes in fresh serum-free DMEM. Cells were resuspended in a final volume of 75 μl of serum-free DMEM. Versican (5 μg in a volume of 25 μl) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The reaction was centrifuged briefly, and the cell pellets were retained for Western blotting of ADAMTS-9FLAG using the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). An equal volume of 2× glycosaminoglycan digestion buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 6.5, 100 mm sodium acetate) containing 0.5 units of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) was added to the supernatant, followed by incubation for 16–18 h at 37 °C. Protein was precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone at −20 °C for 15 min, dissolved in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and electrophoresed on 7% SDS-PAGE prior to blotting to nitrocellulose. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the versican Asp-Pro-Glu-Ala-Ala-Glu (DPEAAE) neoepitope (8Sandy J.D. Westling J. Kenagy R.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Verscharen C. Rodriguez-Mazaneque J.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13372-13378Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. John Sandy) was used at 1:1000 dilution for Western blotting, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection of antibody binding. Anti-DPEAAE recognizes the new C terminus resulting from cleavage of versican at the Glu441–Ala442 bond (this enumeration describes the site in the V1 isoform); the corresponding peptide bond is Glu1428–Ala1429 in the V0 isoform, since this form contains an additional GAG-bearing region, GAG-α, as a result of alternative splicing (8Sandy J.D. Westling J. Kenagy R.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Verscharen C. Rodriguez-Mazaneque J.C. Zimmermann D.R. Lemire J.M. Fischer J.W. Wight T.N. Clowes A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13372-13378Google Scholar). Aggrecan monomer was isolated from bovine articular cartilage as previously described (23Sajdera S.W. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 77-87Google Scholar). Aggrecan (20 μg) was incubated with transfected cells as described above. Neoepitope Western blot analysis was as performed for versican (above), except that the proteolytic cleavage at the Glu1771–Ala1772 bond of aggrecan was detected using anti-Ala1772-Gly-Glu-Gly (AGEG) antiserum (24Tortorella M.D. Pratta M.

Our search for novel ADAMTS proteases identified a human expressed sequence tag (GenBankTM accession number AA205581 encoded by IMAGE clone 646675) from neuroepithelium-derived NT2 cells treated with retinoic acid. The ORF of this expressed sequence tag was homologous to ADAMTS proteases and encoded four TSRs followed by a C-terminal domain containing 10 cysteines that was similar to the C terminus of a polypeptide predicted by the C. elegans F25H8.3 cosmid (C. elegans protein data base Wormpep, www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/C_elegans/wormpep) and subsequently identified as GON-1. The novel human ORF was designated ADAMTS-9. Completion of the full-length protein coding sequence to the putative start codon required several rounds of rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Together, the cloned cDNA sequences represent an mRNA of 8 kb (Fig. 1 a). The 3′-untranslated region in IMAGE clone 646675 contained a consensus polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) 15 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) tail. The most 5′ clone obtained (TS9-B10) contained 32 bp of the 5′-untranslated region. The putative signal peptide coding sequence was preceded by a methionine codon within a satisfactory Kozak consensus sequence (A at −3 relative to ATG), but there was no upstream, in-frame stop codon. The search for ADAMTS-9-related proteins led to identification of a polypeptide (Celera hCP1629711) predicted by exons on human chromosome 12. The complete 5733-nt-long ADAMTS-20 ORF was assembled from overlapping cDNA clones (Fig. 1 a). TheADAMTS20 mRNA was found in low quantities, routinely requiring 35 cycles of PCR or nested PCR for visualization of the PCR products on a gel. Because of the rarity of ADAMTS20transcripts as well as the presence of numerous regions that are difficult to PCR-amplify, we have been so far unable to obtain the complete ORF in a single PCR reaction. ADAMTS-9 and ADAMTS-20 are similar in length, containing 1935 and 1911 amino acids, respectively (Figs.1 b and 2). Each contains a C-terminal array of 14 TSRs (15 TSRs/enzyme) that is interrupted by short “linker” peptides located between TSR-6 and -7 and TSR-8 and -9 that do not have similar sequences. ADAMTS-9 and ADAMTS-20 are very similar to each other, with 48% identity and 64% similarity. The cysteine signatures of individual modules in ADAMTS-9 and ADAMTS-20 are identical to those of most other ADAMTS enzymes, with the exception of the procollagen aminopropeptidases (ADAMTS-2, ADAMTS-3, ADAMTS-14) and ADAMTS-13, which have distinctive prodomains and catalytic domains (12Fernandes R.J. Hirohata S. Engle J.M. Colige A. Cohn D.H. Eyre D.R. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31502-31509Google Scholar). Each module in ADAMTS-9 and ADAMTS-20 (with one exception, described below) contains an even number of cysteines, suggesting participation in internal disulfide bonds. There are 126 cysteines in mature ADAMTS-9, predicting 63 intrachain disulfide bonds. ADAMTS-20 has a Cys to Tyr substitutio"

However, the mechanism of cannabinoid antitumoral action in vivo is as yet unknown. Here we show that local administration of a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid to mice inhibits angiogenesis of malignant gliomas as determined by immunohistochemical analyses and vascular permeability assays. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that at least two mechanisms may be involved in this cannabinoid action: the direct inhibition of vascular endothelial cell migration and survival as well as the decrease of the expression of proangiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 in the tumors. Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis may allow new strategies for the design of cannabinoid-based antitumoral therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2122637273,"Hypoxia in tumors is generally associated with chemoresistance and radioresistance. However, the correlation between the heterodimeric hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and the multidrug resistance transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has not been investigated. Herein, we demonstrate that with increasing size of DU-145 prostate multicellular tumor spheroids the pericellular oxygen pressure and the generation of reactive oxygen species decreased, whereas the alpha-subunit of HIF-1 (HIF-1alpha) and P-gp were up-regulated. Furthermore, P-gp was up-regulated under experimental physiological hypoxia and chemical hypoxia induced by either cobalt chloride or desferrioxamine. The pro-oxidants H2O2 and buthionine sulfoximine down-regulated HIF-1alpha and P-gp, whereas up-regulation was achieved with the radical scavengers dehydroascorbate, N-acetylcysteine, and vitamin E. The correlation of HIF-1alpha and P-gp expression was validated by the use of hepatoma tumor spheroids that were either wild type (Hepa1) or mutant (Hepa1C4) for aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), i.e., HIF-1beta. Chemical hypoxia robustly increased HIF-1alpha as well as P-gp expression in Hepa1 tumor spheroids, whereas no changes were observed in Hepa1C4 spheroids. Hence, our data demonstrate that expression of P-gp in multicellular tumor spheroids is under the control of HIF-1."

The oxidation of reduced, non-fluorescent probes to fluorescent products is a well characterized optical technique to monitor the formation of ROS and has proven useful in the study of the mechanisms underlying apoptosis in a variety of cell types (e.g. 15, 16). To investigate the role of free radical generation in β-cell function and diabetes, we used hydroethidine (HEt) to measure the rate of mitochondrial O2− production in islets isolated from Zucker lean control (ZLC) and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, an animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The oxidation of HEt to the fluorescent cation ethidium (Et) is selective for O2− (6Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Google Scholar, 17Macho A. Castedo M.

Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Google Scholar). We report here that glucose stimulation rapidly increases the ROS levels in ZLC islets. In contrast, ZDF islets exhibit an elevated basal rate of O2− production but are insensitive to glucose stimulation. These differences correlated with a marked abnormality in the ZDF islet mitochondria morphology and function. Our findings provide compelling evidence that β-cell production of ROS is linked to mitochondrial metabolism and that ROS production is highly aberrant in obesity-related diabetes. Together with previous studies, these results further implicate oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Islets of Langerhans were isolated from the pancreata of ZLC, ZDF, and Holtzmann rats and C57BL/KsJ mouse islets by a collagenase digestion and discontinuous Ficoll gradient separation method as described in Ref. 19Roe M.W. Worley III, J.F. Tokuyama Y. Philipson L.H. Sturis J. Tang J. Dukes I.D. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E133-E140Google Scholar. ZLC and ZDF rats were between 6 and 13 weeks of age. Islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 11 mm glucose, 5% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Islets were studied 2 to 7 days after isolation. MIN6 cells (20Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 15% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Cells were used between passages 20 and 30. Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) was used as an indicator of ΔΨm as well as to visualize mitochondria using confocal microscopy (21Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Google Scholar, 22Duchen M.R. Smith P.A. Ashcroft F.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 35-42Google Scholar, 23Rustenbeck I. Herrmann C. Grimmsmann T.

Polonsky K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E340-E351Google Scholar). Rh123 is a lipophilic cation that partitions selectively into the negatively charged mitochondrial membrane. Hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane causes the uptake of Rh123 into mitochondria and a decrease in fluorescence due to quenching (21Emaus R.K. Grunwald R. Lemasters J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 436-448Google Scholar). Islets were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer containing (in mm) 119 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 KH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 2 glucose supplemented with 10 μg/ml Rh123 for 20 min at 37 °C. Rh123 fluorescence was excited at 540 nm (to decrease phototoxicity) and measured at 590 nm. Images were collected with an intensified video camera as previously described (24Zhou Y.P. Pena J.C. Roe M.W. Mittal A. Levisetti M. Baldwin A.C. Pugh W. Ostrega D. Ahmed N. Bindokas V.P. Philipson L.H. Hanahan D. Thompson C.B. Polonsky K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E340-E351Google Scholar). Data were normalized to the average fluorescence intensity recorded during a 5-min period prior to the application of glucose. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. Cells and islets were cultured on glass coverslips and loaded with HEt (1 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Production of O2− was monitored at room temperature (∼24 °C) in KRB-HEPES buffer (KRB containing 10 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4) by the appearance of red fluorescence using rhodamine optics and fluorescence video microscopy with an intensified CCD camera (6Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Google Scholar). HEt was present in all solutions. Minimum illumination was used to limit photodamage to islets. The islet was focused using maximum camera intensifier gain, the gain was then reduced to a constant value, and the initial image was used as the background correction for subsequent data collected in the presence of dye. Images (8-frame average) were only captured every 30 s to further reduce illumination effects. Most experiments were conducted in static bath conditions. Solutions were replaced by adding 4–5× the bath volume while simultaneously drawing off the old solution and were completed within 30 s. A region of interest was drawn within the borders of the islet (in the initial autofluorescence image) to monitor fluorescence changes in real time. A region of interest located in islet-free regions tracked changes in background fluorescence. Observations were typically 20–30 min; after this period of time the camera was saturated by the fluorescence signal. Although longer observations might be attained by reducing camera gain, interpretation of these experiments would be limited by increasing toxicity of ethidium and its binding to cellular polynucleotides (25LePecq J.B. Paoletti C. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 27: 87-106Google Scholar). We attempted to correct data for the thickness of islets obtained from the measured optical cross-section area and estimates of islet volume; however, islets in all cases were thicker than the illuminated volume of the objective. Normalization of oxidation rates did not significantly improve the variation within treatments (data not shown); thus no correction is employed in data presented here. Slopes for fluorescence intensity changes were fitted by linear regression for each experiment as described previously (6Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Google Scholar). The data are expressed as the change in fluorescence intensity (F) as a function of time (F/min). Islets from ZDF or ZLC rats were incubated with HEt as above and visualized using an Ultraview Nipkow disk, Zeiss 410, or Fluoview 200 laser scanning confocal microscope. Some islets were double stained with HEt and Rh123 to examine whether the Et was localized to mitochondria. In this series of experiments Et fluorescence was selectively excited with a 547-nm laser line, and Rh123 was excited at 488 nm. Following background subtraction, images were corrected for cross-talk determined from single-stained preparations under identical imaging conditions. Some islets were co-incubated with mitotracker green FM (Molecular Probes) in place of Rh123. In other experiments Rh123 was applied and laser scanning confocal sections obtained with 0.3-μm steps for at least one cell layer within the islet. Maximum intensity z-axis projections for three sections (1 μm thick) were constructed with MetaMorph. Image detail was enhanced by application of a 5 × 5 unsharp mask kernel. In parallel experiments, free radical generation in islets was monitored with 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA). H2DCFDA (33 μm, from 1000× stock in dimethylformamide) was acutely applied to live islets on the stage of the confocal microscope. Images were collected every few minutes or once after 5 min using minimum laser intensity. H2DCFDA diffuses into cells where the free, non-fluorescent dichlorodihydrofluorescein is produced in the cytoplasm that is then oxidized to the fluorescent moiety, dichlorofluorescein (DCF), by a variety of ROS (26Murrant C.L. Reid M.B. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 55: 236-248Google Scholar). Some islets were co-incubated with HEt and H2DCFDA; images were collected into separate detector channels for subsequent colocalization analyses. Digitized images were processed and pseudocolor overlaid using MetaMorph software. Following exposure to a HEt-containing solution, red fluorescence first appeared in the cytosol of most cells in an islet, and the intensity increased over time (Fig.1). Images shown are at 2-min intervals for 16 min following dye addition. The fluorescence in the cytosol was non-uniform and resembled the staining pattern of mitochondria. A subset of elongated or spherical organelles was commonly observed to stain quickly and intensely within minutes of HEt addition (e.g. Fig. 1 a and see below). We examined living islets incubated with HEt and Rh123 by Nipkow disk confocal microscopy at higher magnification. On this system Et was selectively excited by the 547-nm laser line and Rh123 (and Et) by the 488-nm laser line; images were corrected for signal cross-talk. Adequacy of the correction protocol was confirmed with single-stained samples (data not shown). Et fluorescence was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in a punctate and fusiform pattern, resembling a mitochondrial distribution, superimposed upon a lower, diffuse background (Fig. 2, upper panel). The mitochondrial distribution was then revealed by rescanning the optical plane for Rh123 staining and was very similar (Fig. 2, middle panel). Organelles that stained rapidly and more intensely by Et were co-labeled with Rh123 (Fig. 2, bottom panel). It is evident that organelle movements occurred between collection of the Et and Rh123 images, such as the obvious displacements of otherwise identical structures like those in the magnified inset (Fig. 2, merge panel, 2×). Similar results were obtained with mitotracker green; however, this dye did not penetrate islets beyond the first layer of cells and caused mitochondrial swelling (data not shown). The rate of HEt oxidation under basal conditions in 2 mm glucose (24 °C) required several min to attain a steady linear rate (Fig. 3 A), then typically remained stable for 10 or more min. The exponential increase observed during the first few minutes following HEt addition may be because of dye penetration into the islet. Rates at 35 °C were 4–5 times greater than at room temperature (data not shown). No change in intrinsic fluorescence was observed in the absence of HEt. Stabilized rates were well fit by a linear model (typicallyp < 0.05; r 2 > 0.95;n > 75 islets). Stimulation with 10 mm glucose increased the rate of HEt oxidation in most islets after a delay of ∼3–4 min (Fig.3 A). The rate of HEt oxidation remained relatively constant for up to 10 min. After this period, the fluorescence intensity of Et caused CCD camera saturation. Imaging the subcellular distribution of the fluorescence in islet cells by confocal microscopy revealed that the increase in intensity was because of greater staining of the cytosolic contents but not the nuclei. The rate increase was absent for solution changes with identical glucose content and was smaller for 6versus 10 mm glucose (data not shown). A parallel study showed the changes in Rh123 fluorescence (hyperpolarization) after glucose exposure following a similar time course to the visualization of Et fluorescence in mitochondria (data not shown). The average HEt oxidation rate in ZLC rat islets increased from 1.8 to 3.1 F/min (1.7-fold) following application of 10 mm glucose (Fig. 3 B). Similar values were observed in islets from Holtzmann rats, C57BL/KsJ mice, and MIN6 cells stimulated with glucose (data not shown). The increase in 10 mm glucose was effectively clamped by application of the complex III blocker myxothiazol (200 nm; slope in myxothiazol was decreased to 39.4 ± 2.3% of that in 10 mm glucose;n = 3), suggesting the mitochondria are the source of HEt oxidation rather than a sink for the ethidium. The increased HEt oxidation coincided with the hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential induced by the elevation of glucose concentration (data not shown) and is thus not due to the potential (artifactual) release of Et from within mitochondria. These findings are in accord with parallel experiments that utilized H2DCFDA to visualize the production of ROS. H2DCFDA produces the fluorescent compound DCF when the de-esterified parent compound is oxidized by a variety of intracellular reactive species (26Murrant C.L. Reid M.B. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 55: 236-248Google Scholar). Stimulation of ZLC rat islets with 10 mm glucose increased the rate of DCF production 1.21-fold (2.23 ± 0.2 to 2.70 ± 0.15 F/min; p = 0.0008, paired t test; n = 12 islets). We did not, however, pursue additional studies with H2DCFDA, because of problems with photoconversion and photobleaching of the indicator and phototoxicity associated with the blue excitation light required for DCF excitation. Also, unlike HEt but similar to other esterified fluorescent precursors, H2DCFDA did not penetrate deeply into islets, staining only the outer layer of islet cells. The pattern of DCF fluorescence was also primarily mitochondrial (Fig. 4) as has been described in other cell types (27Lemasters J.J. Qian T. Trollinger D.R. Cascio W.E. Ohata H. Nieminen A.L. Mitochondria in Pathogenesis. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2001: 21-49Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the source of the oxyradicals in isolated islets is the mitochondria. We next examined the rates of Et production in islets isolated from ZDF rats. Under basal glucose levels (2 mm), the rate of HEt oxidation in islets isolated from hyperglycemic ZDF rats was significantly higher (1.8-fold) than in ZLC rat islets. In ZDF islets the rate of Et formation was not significantly affected by the presence of 10 mm glucose (Fig. 3 B; pooled animals >8 weeks: 1.2-fold increase from 3.24 ± 0.29 to 3.96 ± 0.36 F/min; p = 0.12, t test; n = 34 and 32 ZDF islets exposed to 2 and 10 mm glucose, respectively; 12-week old ZDFs only: 3.11 ± 0.3 versus 2.72 ± 0.4 F/min;p = 0.12, paired t test; n = 10). This indicates that O2− production was at a near maximal level in the diabetic islets under low glucose. We also examined the HEt oxidation rates in pre-diabetic ZDF rat islets. The 6-week ZDF rats are not diabetic but are not normal in secretory response even at this stage, and the male rats at this age show impaired glucose tolerance. Hence they can be considered “pre-diabetic.” We found that the basal rate of O2− generation (in the presence of 2 mm glucose) was significantly elevated (2.58 ± 0.39 F/min; p = 0.05 versus ZLC (Fig.3 B), t test; n = 11 ZDF islets isolated from 6-week-old animals). The increase in HEt oxidation elicited by 10 mm glucose was modest but significant in 6-week ZDF islets (rate in 10 glucose = 3.11 ± 0.3;p = 0.03, paired t test, n = 10). These findings suggest that the increase in O2− levels and oxidative stress may be important contributing factors to β-cell dysfunction and not secondary epiphenomena associated with the diabetic state. Although high levels of 02− were already present in 6-week-old pre-diabetic ZDF rat islets that already showed impaired glucose tolerance, islets were still able to respond to glucose with increased HEt oxidation similar to ZLC islets. We examined mitochondrial morphology in 1-μm-thick confocal reconstructions (volume) from ZLC and ZDF islets stained with Rh123, examples of which are shown in Fig. 5. In ZLC islets the mitochondrial morphology was consistent with a network of bright, filamentous structures (Fig. 5, left panels). In ZDF islets, the mitochondria were generally short and swollen (Fig. 5,right panels). Mitochondria were classified as either elongated or short and swollen, and the percentage of cells containing each type was determined. In a sample of 20 volumes from ZLC islets, 55% (11/20) of the volumes contained cells with elongated mitochondria, and 40% (8/20) displayed a mixture of long and short/swollen mitochondria (Fig. 5, left panels). Short, swollen mitochondria were the predominant morphological type in a few cells from only 5% of the volumes. In contrast, of 25 volumes from ZDF islets, the proportion containing cells with each mitochondrial morphology was: elongated 8%, combination of long and short/swollen, 44%, and short, swollen 48% (Fig. 5, right panels). Previous studies have implicated a role of ROS in islet damage associated with diabetes using indirect approaches (e.g. 5, 13, 28). In this paper, we monitored the production of ROS in islets of Langerhans using a fluorescent indicator of O2− (Et) and microfluorometry. HEt oxidation and consequent generation of Et fluorescence is stimulated specifically by superoxide radicals. Previous investigations employing experimental conditions similar to those used in our current studies demonstrated that HEt oxidation and Et fluorescence were not affected by reactive nitrogen species or H2O2 (6Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Google Scholar). Compared with other free radical indicator dyes, HEt offers a selectivity for superoxide under the conditions used and is largely insensitive to photoconversion, photobleaching, and pH sensitivity that limits use of indicators such as H2DCFDA or dihydrorhodamine. Utility of HEt oxidation as a measure of ROS production in islets was validated by several criteria, including concordance with DCF fluorescence, direct visualization of the cytoplasmic localization of the Et signal, absence of Et fluorescence in nuclei (indicative of binding of Et to DNA), and an inhibition of oxyradical production in the presence of the oxidative phosphorylation complex III inhibitor, myxothiazol. Nevertheless, Et fluorescence will underestimate the rate of ROS production, because O2− is rapidly converted to H2O2 and peroxynitrite, lost to other competing sinks, and removed by scavenging enzymes. Critical aspects of the method are to use minimal dye concentration (to avoid toxic effects of Et and quenching of Et fluorescence, to forestall nonlinear fluorescence increases that accompany Et binding to DNA, and to use minimal light excitation (to minimize phototoxicity). The requirement of minimal dye concentration implies detection of only a small fraction of the total O2− generated. Notwithstanding this limitation, HEt oxidation is sufficiently sensitive to detect increased superoxide generation in islets following glucose stimulation. We found two major differences in O2−regulation in ZLC and ZDF islets. First, under low glucose conditions, the rate of O2− generation was significantly higher in the ZDF islets. Second, stimulation with glucose caused a large increase in O2− production in the ZLC but not the ZDF islets. The findings suggest that development and progression of diabetes is associated with a defect in one or more of the mechanisms that regulate ROS content within islet cells. This defect, which appears to be present prior to the onset of overt diabetes, results in a sustained elevation of O2− levels that likely contributes to oxidative stress and β-cell dysfunction. It is noteworthy that the fasting glucose levels of ZDF rats are already slightly elevated at 5–6 weeks of age but that the animals are not yet diabetic (29Pick A. Clark J. Kubstrup C. Levisetti M. Pugh W. Bonner-Weir S. Polonsky K.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 358-364Google Scholar). Our direct measurements of ROS content support the hypothesis that the impairment of β-cell function associated with type 2 diabetes may result in part from abnormal production of O2−. The reason for the significantly higher superoxide levels that occurred in ZDF rat islets under normal glucose levels is uncertain. ZDF rats have defective leptin receptors that result in altered expression of fatty acid metabolism and synthetic pathways, leading to increased islet triglyceride content (30Wang M.Y. Shimabukuro M. Lee Y. Trinh K.Y. Chen J.L. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1020-1025Google Scholar). ZDF rats also have greatly reduced UCP2 levels (31Zhou Y.T. Shimabukuro M. Koyama K. Lee Y. Wang M.Y. Trieu F. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6386-6390Google Scholar), and the consequent increase in mitochondrial polarization could lead to an increase in superoxide production. This concept is consistent with a role for UCP2 and oxidative stress in diabetes. Overexpression of UCP2 has been shown to restore glucose-induced insulin secretion in ZDF islets (30Wang M.Y. Shimabukuro M. Lee Y. Trinh K.Y. Chen J.L. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1020-1025Google Scholar), and UCP2 overexpression has also been shown to protect INS-1 cells from oxidative stress (32Li L.X. Skorpen F. Egeberg K. Jorgensen I.H. Grill V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 273-277Google Scholar). Elevated glucose concentrations are thought to alter metabolism and create oxidative stress in many cell types in addition to glucose-responsive β-cells (2Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S.-I. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.-P. Glardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Google Scholar). ROS generation in β-cells may be more problematic than in other cells because of apparently low levels of SOD, as reported in NOD mouse islets (33Gandy III, S.E. Galbraith R.A. Crouch R.K. Buse M.G. Galbraith G.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1547-1548Google Scholar, 34Malaisse W.J. Malaisse-Lagae F. Sener A. Pipeleers D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1996; 20: 463-466Google Scholar) and HIT and RIN insulinoma cells (37Zhang H. Ollinger K. Brunk U. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 635-641Google Scholar). Levels of SOD may be higher in human islets than in rodent islets, although the expression of SOD in purified human β-cells is unknown (38Welsh N. Margulis B. Borg L.A. Wiklund H.J. Saldeen J. Flodstrom M. Mello M.A. Andersson A. Pipeleers D.G. Hellerstrom C. Eizirik D.L. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 806-820Google Scholar, 39Hausmann D.H. Porstmann T. Weber I. Hausmann S. Dummler W. Liebe S. Emmrich J. Int. J. Pancreatol. 1997; 22: 207-213Google Scholar). Any relative deficiency in SOD activity may make β-cells more sensitive to the toxic effects of glucose, because more superoxide produced in the mitochondrial generation of ATP would be available to interact with any NO that is produced. Interestingly, it has been reported that acute elevations of glucose produce a closely correlated increase in SOD-1 activity in rat islets (40Oliveira H.R. Curi R. Carpinelli A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C507-C510Google Scholar). Our data might suggest this is a response to increased superoxide leak from the electron transport chain observed with acute glucose elevation. Oxyradical damage to islets as opposed to damage in other tissues has been more closely examined in models of type 1 diabetes mellitus than in type 2 diabetes. Inflammatory cytokines, while activating a variety of enzymes, including proteases and phospholipases, may also activate production of various damaging free radicals. In one model of the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (41Nerup J. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Helqvist S. Andersen H.U. Pociot F. Reimers J.I. Cuartero B.G. Karlsen A.E. Bjerre U. Lorenzen T. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S82-S89Google Scholar), immune activation perhaps induced by viral damage was linked to antigen presentation, production of cytokines, and poor β-cell defense against free radicals produced by the β-cells themselves. Together these processes would result in β-cell destruction. The role of NO in this process is in some dispute. Although the cytokine-induced destruction of human β-cells involves oxygen free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation and aldehyde production, NO does not seem to be cytotoxic (42Rabinovitch A. Suarez-Pinzon W.L. Strynadka K. Lakey J.R. Rajotte R.V. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 3197-3202Google Scholar). Our demonstration of increased superoxide levels following acute glucose elevations implies that NO will be more prone to form peroxynitrite, a much more reactive and toxic species. The most likely source of ROS in islets is the mitochondria. This is supported by the staining pattern of Et and DCF that strongly resembles that of the mitochondria as shown by Rh123 fluorescence. Similar staining and conclusions were described for reoxygenated endothelial cells (15Hempel S.L. Buettner G.R. O'Malley Y.Q. Wessels D.A. Flaherty D.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 146-159Google Scholar). ROS damage could account for the altered mitochondrial morphology we observed in ZDF islets, which exhibited a significantly increased content of short swollen mitochondria in comparison with ZLC islets. A previous report mentioned that abnormal mitochondria were present in pre-diabetic and diabetic ZDF β-cells as observed in transmission electron micrographs (43Higa M. Zhou Y.T. Ravazzola M. Baetens D. Orci L. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11513-11518Google Scholar). Both the mitochondrial alteration and onset of diabetes were ameliorated by troglitazone, an insulin sensitizer (5Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2502Google Scholar). The change in morphology may be a consequence of ROS damage. For example, H2O2 treatment and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane with chemical uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation can change filamentous mitochondria to condensed/swollen morphologies (44Maechler P. Jornot L. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27905-27913Google Scholar). Our data show that the altered morphology is predominant within ZDF islets. Taken together, these findings suggest that the higher endogenous reactive oxygen species present in diabetic islets may be responsible for the observed alterations in mitochondrial morphology. An alternative view of these data involves the possibility that ROS serves as a critical signaling molecule, in this case for insulin secretion. Thus, ROS might have a role in normal insulin secretion: increased ROS initially causes the increased insulin secretion under basal glucose conditions and may only indirectly be implicated in the β-cell mitochondrial damage that apparently occurs with time. Supporting this hypothesis are the reportedly low levels of SOD in β-cells, which might actually be necessary for proper ROS signaling to promote normal insulin secretion, rather than being the defect that it is usually considered. On the other hand, overexpression of SOD in β-cells did not impair insulin secretion (11Kubisch H.M. Wang J. Luche R. Carlson E. Bray T.M. Epstein C.J. Phillips J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9956-9959Google Scholar, 13Kubisch H.M. Wang J. Bray T.M. Phillips J.P. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1563-1566Google Scholar), and we could find no evidence in the many reports using free radical scavengers in diabetic models to show that free radical scavengers impair insulin secretion. Indeed, the opposite is usually the case. Given the recent interest in the possibility that uncoupling proteins might function in part through a free radical mechanism (48Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St-Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Google Scholar) or not (46Couplan E. del Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Alves-Guerra M.C. Ricquier D. Goubern M. Bouillaud F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26268-26275Google Scholar), this remains an intriguing concept for further study in insulin-secreting cells. Our studies, using real-time, direct measurements of superoxide, indicate that O2− generation is coupled to metabolism, mitochondrial metabolism in particular. While this paper was in review, a similar conclusion was reached by Sakai et al. (47Sakai K. Matsumotot K. Nishikawa T. Suefuji M. Nakamura K. Hirashmia Y. Kawashima J. Shirotani T. Ichinose K. Brownlee M. Araki E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 216-222Google Scholar) without imaging mitochondria directly. We also found that O2− generation is not only increased in frankly diabetic ZDF rat islets but also in pre-diabetic ZDF rat islets that already have mildly impaired insulin secretion and glucose tolerance. This initial validation of an optical method for the detection of ROS in islets and their localization in mitochondria with parallel measures of membrane potential and calcium responses will facilitate additional studies to identify and characterize the role of ROS in insulin secretion and the onset of diabetes.

Here we find that yeast Rad51p and Rad54p support robust homologous pairing between single-stranded DNA and a chromatin donor. In contrast, bacterial RecA is incapable of catalyzing homologous pairing with a chromatin donor. We also show that Rad54p possesses many of the biochemical properties of bona fideATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes, such as ySWI/SNF. Rad54p can enhance the accessibility of DNA within nucleosomal arrays, but it does not seem to disrupt nucleosome positioning. Taken together, our results indicate that Rad54p is a chromatin-remodeling enzyme that promotes homologous DNA pairing events within the context of chromatin.

Taken together, our results indicate that Rad54p is a chromatin-remodeling enzyme that promotes homologous DNA pairing events within the context of chromatin. Chromosomal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; HR, homologous recombination; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; TFO, triplex-forming oligonucleotide; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; Mnase, micrococcal nuclease arise through exposure of cells to harmful environmental agents such as ionizing radiation or mutagenic chemicals (radiomimetics, alkylating agents, etc.). DSBs can also be caused by endogenously produced oxygen radicals, by errors in DNA replication, or as obligatory intermediates during programmed cellular processes, such as meiosis or V(D)J recombination (1Hiom K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R278-R280Google Scholar, 2Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Google Scholar, 3Wood R.D. Mitchell M. Sgouros J. Lindhal T. Science. 2001; 291: 1284-1289Google Scholar). Cell survival and maintenance of genome integrity depend on efficient repair of DSBs, because unrepaired or misrepaired DSBs may lead to mutations, gene translocations, gross chromosomal rearrangements, or cellular lethality. Several pathways for repairing DSBs have evolved and are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes. Homologous recombination (HR) is a major pathway of DSB repair in all eukaryotes and has a distinct advantage over other mechanisms in that it is mostly error-free. In organisms ranging from yeast to human, HR is mediated by members of theRAD52 epistasis group (RAD50, RAD51,RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57,RAD59, MRE11, and XRS2). Accordingly, mutations in any one of these genes result in sensitivity to ionizing radiation and other DSB-inducing agents (2Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Google Scholar). The importance of the HR pathway in maintaining genome integrity is underscored by the fact that mutations in each one of its critical factors have been correlated with chromosomal instability-related ailments, including ataxia telangiectasia-like disease, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, Li Fraumeni syndrome, as well as various forms of cancer (4Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitro studies have suggested the following sequence of molecular events that lead to the recombinational repair of a DSB. First, the 5′ ends of DNA that flank the break are resected by an exonuclease to create ssDNA tails (5Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Google Scholar). Next, Rad51p polymerizes onto these DNA tails to form a nucleoprotein filament that has the capability to search for a homologous duplex DNA molecule. After DNA homology has been located, the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament catalyzes the formation of a heteroduplex DNA joint with the homolog. The process of DNA homology search and DNA joint molecule formation is called “homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange.” Subsequent steps entail DNA synthesis to replace the missing information followed by resolution of DNA intermediates to yield two intact duplex DNA molecules (6Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. van Gent D.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 483-489Google Scholar). The homologous DNA pairing activity of Rad51p is enhanced by Rad54p (7Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Google Scholar). Rad54p is a member of the Swi2p/Snf2p protein family (8Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Google Scholar) that has DNA-stimulated ATPase activity and physically interacts with Rad51p (7Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Google Scholar, 9Jiang H. Xie Y. Houston P. Stemke-Hale K. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33181-33186Google Scholar, 10Clever B. Interthal H. Schmuckli-Maurer J. King J. Sigrist M. Heyer W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2535-2544Google Scholar). Because of its relatedness to the Swi2p/Snf2p family of ATPases, Rad54p may have chromatin remodeling activities in addition to its established role in facilitating Rad51p-mediated homologous pairing reactions. In this study we show that Rad51p and Rad54p mediate robust d-loop formation with a chromatin donor, whereas the bacterial recombinase, RecA, can only function with naked DNA. Furthermore, we find that the ATPase activity of Rad54p is essential for d-loop formation on chromatin and that Rad54p can use the free energy from ATP hydrolysis to enhance the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA. Experiments are also presented to suggest that chromatin remodeling by Rad54p and yeast SWI/SNF involves DNA translocation. All DNA manipulations were carried out using standard methods (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). Plasmid pXG540 and T4 EndonucleaseVII used in the cruciform extrusion experiments were a kind gift of Dr. T. Owen-Hughes. The oligonucleotide used for triplex formation was TFO (triplex-forming oligonucleotide) (5′-TTCTTTTCTTTCTTCTTTCTTT-3′). To generate pMJ5, the annealed oligonucleotides TFOB5 (5′-TCGAGAAGAAAAGAAAGAAGAAAGAAAC-3′) and TFOB3 (5′-TCGAGT TTCTTTCTTCTTTCTTTTCTTC-3′) were ligated to the product of aXhoI digestion carried out on pCL7c (12Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Google Scholar). This yielded a pBluescript SKII (−) plasmid containing 5 head-to-tail repeats of the 208-bp Lytechinus variegatus 5S rDNA nucleosome positioning element flanked by a TFO-binding site. The DNA template (208–11) for reconstituting nucleosomal arrays for the ATPase, remodeling, and Mnase assays consists aNotI-HindIII fragment derived from pCL7b (12Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Google Scholar), containing 11 head-to-tail repeats of a 5S rRNA gene from L. variegatus, each one possessing a nucleosome positioning sequence. The sixth nucleosome is tagged by a unique SalI restriction site. Recombinant yeast Rad51p, Rad54p, rad54K341Ap, and rad54K341Rp were overexpressed in yeast and purified as previously described (7Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Google Scholar). SWI/SNF purification was as described (13Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Google Scholar). Histone octamers were purified from chicken erythrocytes as described by Hansen et al. (14Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Google Scholar). Octamer concentrations were determined by measurements of A230 (15Stein A. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 130: 103-134Google Scholar). Nucleosomal array DNA templates (pXG540, pMJ5, or 208–11) were labeled by the Klenow polymerase fill-in reaction using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 μCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). Nucleosomal arrays were reconstituted by salt dialysis as previously described (13Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Google Scholar), and the nucleosome saturation was determined to be 60–80% by digestion analysis. Oligonucleotide D1 (90-mer) used in the d-loop experiments has the sequence: 5′-AAATCAATCTAAAGTATATATGAGTAAACTTGGTCTGACAGTTACCAATGCTTAATCAGTGAGGCACCTATCTCAGCGATCTGTCTATTT-3′, being complementary to positions 1932–2022 of pBluescript SK(−) replicative form I DNA. Oligonucleotide D1 was 5′ end-labeled with32P using [γ-32P]dATP and polynucleotide kinase, as described (7Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Google Scholar). Buffer R (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.0 mm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 20 mm creatine phosphate and 30 μg/ml creatine kinase) was used for the reactions; all of the incubation steps were carried out at 30 °C. Rad51 (0.8 μm) and Rad54 (120 nm) were incubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotide D1 (2.4 μm nucleotides) for 5 min to assemble the presynaptic filament, which was then mixed with naked pBluescript replicative form I DNA (38 μm base pairs) or the same DNA assembled into chromatin (38 μmbase pairs). Chromatin assembly was monitored by following topological changes as well as measuring the degree of occlusion of a uniqueEcoRI restriction site close to the D1 sequence. Substrates were estimated to be ∼80% saturated with nucleosomes. The reactions containing RecA protein (0.8 μm) were assembled in the same manner, except that they were supplemented with an additional 12.5 mm MgCl2 at the time of incorporation of the duplex substrates. At the indicated times, 4-μl portions of the reactions were withdrawn and mixed with an equal volume of 1% SDS containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, the deproteinized samples were run in 1% agarose gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. The gels were dried, and the radiolabeled DNA species were visualized and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Personal Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad). Recombinant yeast Rad54p (1 nm) was incubated at 30 °C or 37 °C with 5 nm of either naked 208–11 dsDNA or reconstituted nucleosomal arrays in the presence of 100 μm ATP, 2.5μCi [γ-32P]dATP (6000 μCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), 2.5% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 μm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml BSA. For the DNA length-dependence assays, 5 nm Rad54p, 5 nmRad51p, or 10 nm SWI/SNF were used. Oligonucleotides (random N-mers ranging from 10–100 nucleotides in length) were PAGE-purified to ensure length homogeneity (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA). Samples were taken after 2, 5, 15, and 30 min and resolved by TLC. The proportion of liberated32P-pyrophosphate was determined using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant Software. ATPase assays were independently repeated 3 times, yielding very similar results. Cruciform formation assays were performed as previously described (16Havas K. Flaus A. Phelan M. Kingston R. Wade P.A. Lilley D.M. Owen-Hughes T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1133-1142Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 ng ofAvaI-linearized pXG540 (either naked, N, or nucleosomal, C) were incubated with various concentrations of Rad54, Rad51, or rad54 K341A and 0.15 mg/ml EndoVII (except where noted), in the presence of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP (except where noted), 3 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, and 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase for 30 min at 30 °C. The products were resolved in 1.2% agarose gels and visualized with Sybr Gold staining (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) followed by analysis with ImageQuant software. For the coupled SWI/SNF-or Rad54-SalI reactions, reconstituted 208–11 nucleosomal arrays (∼1 nm final concentration) were preincubated at 37 °C for 20 min with 2.5units/μl SalI in a buffer containing (final concentrations) 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 3% glycerol. Nucleosomal arrays were ∼80% saturated with nucleosomes. Buffer, 2 nm SWI/SNF complex, or various concentrations of recombinant Rad51p and Rad54p were added and samples were taken at the indicated time points, vigorously mixed for 10s with 25 μl TE and 50 μl 1:1 solution of phenol/chloroform. The purified DNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels in the presence of 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The gels were then dried on 3MM Whatman paper. The fraction of cut and uncut DNA was determined by PhosphorImager analysis using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Experiments were repeated independently at least 3 times, which yielded very similar results. 15 nmreconstituted 208–11 nucleosomal arrays were incubated at 37 °C with 2 nm SWI/SNF, 100 nm Rad54p, or buffer, in the presence of 2 mm ATP, 5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 3 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml BSA, 0.5% glycerol. After 20 min, 0.0005 units of Microccocal Nuclease (Worthington) was added to the reaction, and aliquots were taken at the indicated time points and then treated for 20 min with 2 μg/μl proteinase K and extracted twice with a 1:1 solution of phenol:chloroform. The resulting digestion products were resolved by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels, run at 2.5 volts/cm for 12 h. The gels were fixed, dried, and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant Software. Triple-helix formation was performed as described (17Firman K. Szczelkun M.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2094-2102Google Scholar). Briefly, equimolar concentrations (100 nm) of SspI-linearized pMJ5 and32P-labeled TFO were mixed in buffer MM (25 mmMES, pH 5.5, 10 mm MgCl2) at 57 °C for 15 min and left to cool to room temperature overnight. The resulting triplex was either used directly or reconstituted into nucleosomal arrays. To introduce nicks into the DNA, pMJ5 was exposed to various concentrations of DNaseI (Promega, Madison, WI) for 2 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped with 5 mm EDTA, vigorously mixed for 10 s with a 1:1 solution of phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in water. The degree of nicking introduced by DNaseI treatment was assessed by electrophoretic analysis of native and heat-denatured samples (in the presence of 15% formamide) on denaturing 1.3% agarose gels, followed by Sybr Gold Stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The triplex-containing substrates (5 nm) were incubated at 30 °C with 5 nm recombinant Rad54 protein or SWI/SNF complex, in a buffer containing 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml BSA, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm phosphocreatine, 28 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and where noted, 3 mm ATP. Samples were taken at the indicated time points, the reactions were quenched with GSMB buffer (15% (w/v) glucose, 3% (w/v) SDS, 250 mm4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, pH 5.5, 0.4 mg/ml bromphenol blue), and analyzed in 1.2% agarose gels (40 mm Tris acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 5.5) at 10 volts/cm for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Gels were fixed in 5% acetic acid, 50% methanol for 1 h, and dried. The proportion of bound and free TFO was determined using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant Software. Repair of a DSB by homologous recombination begins with the invasion of a double-stranded, homologous donor by a Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament, also referred to as the presynaptic filament. This strand invasion reaction is typically monitored in vitro by following the Rad51p-dependent formation of ad-loop between a radiolabeled oligonucleotide and a homologous double-stranded DNA donor (Fig.1 A). In this case, efficientd-loop formation also requires the ATPase activity of Rad54p. In vivo, however, the search for homology and strand invasion involves a homologous donor that is assembled into chromatin. Given that the Rad54p ATPase shows sequence relatedness to known chromatin remodeling enzymes, it was of considerable interest to examine the ability of Rad54p to promote Rad51p-dependentd-loop formation with a nucleosomal donor. Fig. 1 shows the results of d-loop assays that use either a circular, naked DNA donor or this same circular DNA assembled into nucleosomes. Consistent with previous studies, the combination of yeast Rad51p and Rad54p led to rapid and highly efficientd-loop formation on the naked DNA donor (Fig.1 B). A similar level of d-loop formation was also obtained when the bacterial recombinase RecA was used in these assays with naked DNA (Fig. 1 C). Surprisingly, assembly of the circular donor into chromatin had no effect on the efficiency ofd-loop formation by Rad51p and Rad54p (Fig. 1 B).d-loop formation on the chromatin donor required ATP hydrolysis by Rad54p, because nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (ATPγS and AMP-PNP) were unable to substitute for ATP (Fig. 1 C,panel I,lanes 6 and 7), and two ATPase-defective mutant variants of Rad54p, rad54K341Ap and rad54K341Rp (18Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Google Scholar), were inactive (Fig. 1 D). In contrast to reactions that contained Rad51p/Rad54p, the activity of RecA was completely eliminated when the donor was assembled into nucleosomes (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, addition of Rad54p to the RecA reaction did not rescued-loop formation on chromatin (Fig. 1 D,panel I, lane 11). Thus, the eukaryotic recombination proteins have the unique capability of performing the DNA strand invasion reaction with a chromatin donor. The ATPase activity of Rad54p is required for many of its biological functions in vivo and for enhancing Rad51p-mediated homologous DNA pairing reactions in vitro, both on naked DNA (18Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Google Scholar) and on chromatin (Fig. 1 D). Given the latter finding, we were interested in determining whether chromatin influences the ATPase activity of Rad54p. As shown in Fig. 2, both naked DNA (solid squares) and chromatin (solid triangles) stimulated the ATPase activity of Rad54p at 30 °C, with naked DNA being somewhat more effective. At the low protein concentrations at which these assays were performed (1 nm), purified Rad54p is extremely temperature-labile and is rapidly inactivated at 37 °C (Fig. 2; Ref. 36Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43578-43587Google Scholar). Thus, as expected, the ATPase activity of Rad54p was not detectable in the presence of naked DNA when the reactions were performed at 37 °C (Fig. 2,open squares). Importantly, when the reaction was carried out in the presence of chromatin (open triangles), the rate of ATP hydrolysis at 37 °C was even greater than the rate obtained in reactions conducted at 30 °C. Importantly, there was no measurable ATPase activity associated with the nucleosomal arrays in the absence of Rad54p, and BSA, free histones, and replication protein A were unable to stimulate the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of Rad54p at 37 °C. These results indicate that nucleosomal DNA is uniquely able to protect Rad54p from thermal inactivation, and these data suggest that Rad54p may physically interact with nucleosomes. A number of chromatin remodeling complexes that contain Swi2/Snf2-related ATPases have been shown to alter chromatin structure by generating superhelical torsion in DNA and nucleosomal arrays (16Havas K. Flaus A. Phelan M. Kingston R. Wade P.A. Lilley D.M. Owen-Hughes T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1133-1142Google Scholar). Indeed, the ability to introduce superhelical stress may represent a primary biomechanical activity of all Swi2/Snf2-like ATP-dependent DNA motors, and this activity is likely to be crucial for catalyzing alterations in chromatin structure. Previous studies have shown that Rad54p can also generate both negative and positive supercoiled domains in dsDNA, and it has been suggested that this activity reflects the tracking of Rad54p along DNA (19Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Google Scholar, 20Ristic D. Wyman C. Paulusma C. Kanaar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8454-8460Google Scholar). We investigated whether Rad54p is able to introduce superhelical torsion on nucleosomal substrates, using a cruciform extrusion test that has been used for examining other chromatin remodeling enzymes (Fig. 3 A). In this assay, superhelical torsion leads to extrusion of a cruciform that is then recognized and cleaved by bacteriophage T4 endonuclease VII that has high specificity for this DNA structure (16Havas K. Flaus A. Phelan M. Kingston R. Wade P.A. Lilley D.M. Owen-Hughes T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1133-1142Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies (19Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Google Scholar), Rad54p action generates torsional stress on a linear, dsDNA substrate (N) which leads to cruciform extrusion (Fig.3 B, lanes 4–6). Importantly, Rad54p was able to generate torsional stress on the nucleosomal substrate (C) with comparable efficiency (lanes 12–14). The addition of 100 nm Rad51p greatly stimulated the ability of Rad54p to promote the formation of cruciform structures on both naked and nucleosomal substrates (compare lanes 4 and 8, and 12 and 16, respectively. Also note the decreased levels of linear template in lanes 16–18). Importantly, Rad51p fails to support cruciform formation by itself (lanes 7 and 15). As expected, the generation of torsional stress required ATP (lanes 19 and 20). Furthermore, the ATP hydrolysis mutant variant rad54 K341A was inactive in these assays (data not shown). These data indicate that Rad54p, like other Swi2/Snf2 family members, uses the free energy from ATP hydrolysis to alter DNA topology and that nucleosomal arrays constitute excellent substrates for this activity. How Rad54p introduces topological stress in nucleosomal DNA is unclear. Previously, we suggested that superhelical torsion might result from translocation of Rad54p along the DNA double helix (19Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Google Scholar). Recently, chromatin remodeling by the yeast RSC complex (which contains the Swi2/Snf2-related ATPase, Sth1p) has been shown to involve ATP-dependent DNA translocation (21Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2120-2134Google Scholar). To further evaluate the ability of Rad54p to translocate on DNA, we used a DNA triple-helix-displacement assay that was originally developed to follow the translocation of a type I restriction endonuclease along DNA (17Firman K. Szczelkun M.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2094-2102Google Scholar). The substrate used (see Fig.4 A) consists of a radioactively labeled oligonucleotide (TFO*) bound via Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds to the major groove of a 2.5-kb linear dsDNA. Translocation of a protein along the DNA displaces the triplex, which can be detected as dissociation of the radioactive TFO* from the DNA triplex. Fig. 4 B shows typical levels of triplex displacement in the absence or presence of Rad54p or yeast SWI/SNF. Both Rad54p and ySWI/SNF were able to efficiently displace a preformed triplex from both naked (squares) and nucleosomal (triangles) substrates in an ATP-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained when the TFO*-bound substrate contained single-strand nicks (data not shown), strongly suggesting that the displacement of the TFO* reflects translocation of Rad54p and ySWI/SNF and that it is not due simply to the generation of torsional stress. Thus, yeast RSC (21Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2120-2134Google Scholar), ySWI/SNF, and Rad54p (Fig. 4) all share the ability to use the free energy from ATP hydrolysis to disrupt triplex DNA. The “inch-worm” model for DNA translocation, originally envisioned (22Yarranton G.T. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1658-1662Google Scholar) for DNA helicases and later modified by Velankar et al. (23Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Google Scholar), proposes that the translocating enzyme progresses along the contour of the DNA in steps of a single base, and each step requires the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule. This model predicts that the rate of ATP hydrolysis of a unidirectional DNA translocating enzyme will depend on the length of the DNA (24Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 205-212Google Scholar). To investigate whether Rad54p has ATPase properties characteristic of a unidirectional DNA translocating enzyme, the rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured in the presence of saturating amounts of single-stranded oligonucleotides ranging from 10 to 100 nucleotides in length (Fig.5). For comparison, we also monitored the ATPase activity of yeast SWI/SNF (triangles). In the case of Rad54p, oligonucleotides shorter than 40 bases failed to stimulate the ATPase activity of Rad54p (diamonds), whereas oligonucleotides between 40 and 70 bases led to a stimulation of ATPase activity that was proportional to DNA length. For oligonucleotides longer than 70 bases, the ATPase activity no longer increased with the DNA length. When Rad51p was added to these reactions (squares), shorter oligonucleotides became more effective in promoting ATP hydrolysis, and the overall activity was enhanced. Likewise, the ATPase activity of ySWI/SNF (triangles) was also proportional to the DNA length, with a plateau reached at 60 bases. These results are fully consistent with both Rad54p and ySWI/SNF coupling ATP hydrolysis to unidirectional translocation, in which the rate of DNA binding is slower than the rate of DNA translocation (21Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2120-2134Google Scholar). In this case, no ATP hydrolysis is observed with very short substrates, presumably because a minimum DNA length is required for Rad54p or ySWI/SNF to bind and to translocate before reaching an end and releasing the DNA. When the substrate is ∼30–40 nucleotides in length, Rad54p and ySWI/SNF readily bind the substrate, and more extended translocation events take place. The rate of ATP hydrolysis is fairly constant with DNA substrates longer than 60–70 nucleotides, reflecting the possibility that Rad54p and ySWI/SNF have little processivity, and thus they release their substrate after ∼60–70 bases regardless of the total length of the DNA molecule. Although the triphasic kinetics of ATPase activity are consistent with a DNA-translocation mechanism, it remains a possibility that the longer single-stranded oligonucleotides exhibit more extended secondary structures that are either more proficient at binding Rad54p (or SWI/SNF) or stimulating its ATPase activity. Cairns and colleagues (21Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2120-2134Google Scholar) proposed that short-range translocation events may be the key feature of chromatin remodeling enzymes, leading to a “pumping” of DNA across the surface of the histone octamer, which then results in enhanced DNA accessibility and nucleosome movements. To investigate whether Rad54p might also enhance the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA, we used an assay in which nucleosome remodeling activity is coupled to restriction enzyme activity such that remodeling is revealed as an enhancement of restriction-enzyme cleavage rates (12Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Google Scholar). This assay uses a nucleosomal array substrate in which the central nucleosome of an 11-mer array contains a unique SalI site located at the predicted dyad axis of symmetry (see Fig.6 A). In the absence of a remodeling enzyme, the rate of SalI cleavage is very slow (Fig. 6 A, solid diamonds), whereas addition of a remodeling enzyme, such as yeast SWI/SNF, leads to enhanced digestion (Fig. 6 A, solid squares). When Rad54p was added to the remodeling reactions,SalI digestion was also dramatically enhanced (solid circles, triangles), although a higher concentration of this protein (50 nm) was required to achieve a rate of digestion comparable with that of reactions that contained yeast SWI/SNF (2 nm, squares). However, when Rad51p (50 nm) and Rad54p (50 nm) were both present in the reaction, much higher levels of remodeling were attained (open circles). Note that Rad51p has no intrinsic chromatin remodeling activity (open diamonds). The stimulation of the Rad54p chromatin remodeling activity by Rad51p is congruent with previous studies showing that Rad51p enhances the rate of ATP hydrolysis and DNA supercoiling by Rad54p (19, 25, see Fig. 3). Thus, the above data indicate that Rad54p is sufficient for chromatin remodeling activity but that the combination of Rad51p and Rad54p constitutes a more potent remodeling machine. A number of chromatin remodeling complexes that contain a Swi2/Snf2-related ATPase (ySWI/SNF, dCHRAC, dNURF, and xMi-2) can use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move nucleosomes in cis (26Guschin D. Wade P.A. Kikyo N. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5238-5245Google Scholar, 27Hamiche A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Gdula D.A. Wu C. Cell. 1999; 97: 833-842Google Scholar, 28Jaskelioff M. Gavin I.M. Peterson C.L. Logie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3058-3068Google Scholar, 29Langst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Google Scholar, 30Whitehouse I. Flaus A. Cairns B.R. White M.F. Workman J.L. Owen-Hughes T. Nature. 1999; 400: 784-787Google Scholar). To investigate whether Rad54p can also catalyze nucleosome mobilization, 32P-end-labeled nucleosomal arrays were incubated with buffer, ySWI/SNF, or Rad54p, and nucleosome positions were mapped by micrococcal nuclease (Mnase) digestion (Fig.6 B). Mnase can only cleave DNA between nucleosomes, which leads to a periodic ladder of digestion products indicative of a positioned 11-mer nucleosomal array (Fig. 6 B). Consistent with our previous studies, incubation with ySWI/SNF (2 nm) and ATP leads to a complete disruption of the Mnase digestion pattern, indicative of nucleosome sliding (Fig. 6 B, left panel; also see Ref. 28Jaskelioff M. Gavin I.M. Peterson C.L. Logie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3058-3068Google Scholar). In contrast, addition of Rad54p (100 nm) and ATP had very little effect on the cleavage periodicity (Fig. 6 B, right panel). Likewise, addition of both Rad51p and Rad54p (100 nm each) to these assays did not change the Mnase digestion profile (data not shown). Importantly, these experiments used concentrations of ySWI/SNF and Rad54p that yielded similar levels of chromatin remodeling in the restriction enzyme accessibility assay (Fig. 6 A). Thus, although Rad54p can enhance the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA to restriction enzymes, this activity does not appear to reflect large scale rearrangement of nucleosome positions. In eukaryotes, chromatin presents an accessibility dilemma for all DNA-mediated processes, including gene transcription and DNA repair. Although much progress has been made on identifying the enzymes that remodel chromatin structure to facilitate transcription, less is known of how the DNA-repair machinery gains access to damaged DNA within chromatin (reviewed in Ref. 31Green C.M. Almouzni G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 28-33Google Scholar). In particular, it has not been clear how the recombinational repair machinery can locate short regions of DNA homology when those DNA donor sequences are assembled into chromatin. Here we have shown that the yeast recombination proteins, Rad51p and Rad54p, are sufficient to promote heteroduplex DNA joint formation with chromatin. In contrast, the bacterial recombinase RecA is completely inactive with a chromatin donor. The unique capacity of the eukaryotic machinery to contend with chromatin likely reflects the chromatin-remodeling activity of Rad54p, in which the free energy from ATP hydrolysis enhances the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA. Strand invasion with chromatin may also require a specific interaction between Rad51p and Rad54p because the chromatin remodeling activity of Rad54p does not facilitate RecA-dependent d-loop formation with chromatin (Fig. 1 D). Recently, Alexiadis and Kadonaga have reported that the Drosophila Rad51 and Rad54 proteins can also facilitate strand invasion with chromatin (35Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeling enzymes can perform two separable reactions: 1) they can use the free energy from ATP hydrolysis to enhance the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA and 2) they can use this free energy to mobilize nucleosomes in cis (reviewed in Ref. 32Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Google Scholar). Recent work from Cairns and colleagues have suggested that both of these activities may be caused by ATP-dependent “pumping” of DNA into the nucleosome (21Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2120-2134Google Scholar). In this model, small amounts of DNA translocation might lead to transient exposure of small “loops” of DNA on the surface of the histone octamer, whereas larger quantities of DNA “pumped” into the nucleosome would lead to changes in nucleosome positions. Our data support this model, as we find that both yeast SWI/SNF and Rad54p, like yeast RSC (21Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2120-2134Google Scholar), can disrupt a DNA triplex in an ATP-dependent reaction, presumably by translocation of DNA along the surface of the enzyme or by translocation of the enzyme along the DNA. Furthermore, the ATPase activities of ySWI/SNF and Rad54p are sensitive to DNA length, which is diagnostic of DNA-translocating enzymes (21Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2120-2134Google Scholar). Although ySWI/SNF and Rad54p can both enhance the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA, only ySWI/SNF appears to be proficient at changing nucleosome positioning. This result suggests that the precise mechanism of chromatin remodeling by Rad54p may be distinct from that of ySWI/SNF. For instance, Rad54p may only be able to pump small amounts of DNA across the histone octamer surface. Alternatively, Rad54p may translocate along DNA, rather than pumping DNA into the nucleosome. In this model, Rad54p may “pull” the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament along the chromatin fiber, leading to changes in nucleosomal DNA topology and DNA accessibility. Such a DNA tracking mechanism might play a key role in facilitating both the search for homology as well as the strand invasion step. Our results suggest that Rad54p is an extremely versatile recombination protein that plays key roles in several steps of homologous recombination. Recently, we found that Rad54p is required for optimal recruitment of Rad51p to a double strand break in vivo, and likewise Rad54p can promote formation of the presynaptic filamentin vitro by helping Rad51p contend with the inhibitory effects of the ssDNA-binding protein replication protein A. 2B. Wolner, S. Van Komen, P. Sung, and C.L. Peterson, submitted for publication. Several studies over the past few years have also shown that the ATPase activity of Rad54p plays key roles subsequent to formation of the presynaptic filament. For instance, Rad54p is required for the Rad51p-nucleoprotein filament to form a heteroduplex joint DNA molecule, even when the homologous donor is naked DNA (Fig. 1 A; see also Refs. 7Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Google Scholar,18Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Google Scholar, 33Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Google Scholar). In this case, it has been proposed that Rad54p might use the free energy from ATP hydrolysis to translocate along DNA, which facilitates the homology search process. This DNA-translocation model is fully consistent with our findings that Rad54p can displace a DNA triplex and that the ATPase activity of Rad54p is proportional to DNA length. Rad54p also stimulates heteroduplex DNA extension of established joint molecules (34Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8447-8453Google Scholar). Finally, we have shown that Rad54p is required for Rad51p-dependent heteroduplex joint molecule formation with a chromatin donor. In this case, our results suggest that the ATPase activity of Rad54p is used to translocate the enzyme along the nucleosomal fiber, generating superhelical torsion, which leads to enhanced nucleosomal DNA accessibility. It seems likely that this chromatin remodeling activity of Rad54p might also facilitate additional steps after heteroduplex joint formation. Future studies are now poised to reconstitute the complete homologous recombinational repair reaction that fully mimics each step in the repair of chromosomal DNA double strand breaks in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2018421011,"RGS proteins finely tune heterotrimeric G-protein signaling. Implying the need for such fine-tuning in the developing vascular system, in situ hybridization revealed a striking and extensive expression pattern of Rgs5 in the arterial walls of E12.5-E17.5 mouse embryos. The distribution and location of the Rgs5-positive cells typified that of pericytes and strikingly overlapped the known expression pattern of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-beta. Both E14.5 PDGFR-beta- and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B-deficient mice exhibited markedly reduced levels of Rgs5 in their vascular plexa and small arteries. This likely reflects the loss of pericytes in the mutant mice. RGS5 acts as a potent GTPase activating protein for Gi(alpha) and Gq(alpha) and it attenuated angiotensin II-, endothelin-1-, sphingosine-1-phosphate-, and PDGF-induced ERK-2 phosphorylation. Together these results indicate that RGS5 exerts control over PDGFR-beta and GPCR-mediated signaling pathways active during fetal vascular maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1973261882,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) acts as a morphogen in many cell types. Recent studies have shown that hedgehog signaling is involved in vascular development as well as postnatal angiogenesis. However, the direct action of Shh on cultured endothelial cells has not been clearly shown. To address this issue, we examined the effect of Shh on morphological changes by murine brain capillary endothelial cells (IBE cells) and human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). Shh induced capillary morphogenesis by these cells. The effect was inhibited by cyclopamine or pertussis toxin. Shh-induced capillary morphogenesis was also blocked by LY294002, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitor. Shh rapidly increased PI3-kinase activity in IBE cells and HUVECs; this activity was inhibited by cyclopamine. Nuclear localization of Gli1 was increased in Shh-treated IBE cells, which was not affected by LY294002. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide inhibited Shh-induced capillary morphogenesis. In IBE cells expressing kinase-inactive c-Fes, Shh failed to stimulate PI3-kinase activity and capillary morphogenesis. Considered collectively, Shh induced capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells through both rapid activation of c-Fes/PI3-kinase pathways and transcriptionally regulated pathways."

A total of six tail-anchored proteins are present in the mitochondrial outer membrane and have relatively hydrophilic transmembrane segments that serve as targeting signals. The rest, by far the majority, localize via a bipartite system of signals: uniformly hydrophobic tail anchors are first inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum, and additional segments within the cytosolic domain of each protein can dictate subsequent sorting to a precise destination within the cell. Tail-anchored proteins have an NH2-terminal cytosolic domain anchored to intracellular membranes by a single, COOH-terminal, transmembrane segment.

Lithgow T. Traffic. 2001; 2: 66-71Google Scholar). In the Bcl-2 family of proteins, key regulators of the programmed cell death pathway in animal cells, 12 of the 16 known family members are tail-anchored to either the mitochondrial outer membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, and their membrane location is critical for function (2Antonsson B. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 306: 347-361Google Scholar). TheSNAP-receptors (SNAREs)1 are a family of proteins essential for intracellular membrane fusion, and 19 of the 23 SNAREs in yeast are tail-anchored proteins. Membrane fusion absolutely requires the participation of SNAREs in both the donor and acceptor membrane, and each of the known SNAREs has a restricted location at a defined membrane compartment of the endomembrane system (3Pelham H.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 1-8Google Scholar, 4Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Google Scholar). Tail-anchored proteins fold co-translationally and the single hydrophobic segment at their carboxyl terminus allows for post-translational insertion into membranes (5Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Google Scholar, 6Federov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32715-32718Google Scholar). Once membrane is inserted, the amino-terminal domain of the protein is displayed in the cytosol. An elegant study on the tail-anchored SNARE synaptobrevin-1/VAMP-1a found that the protein is inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently sorted to presynaptic vesicles (5Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Google Scholar). Cytochrome b 5, another tail-anchored protein, is inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and maintained there despite some escape to, and retrieval from, thecis-Golgi cisternae (7Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Longhi R. Bulbarelli A. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 899-914Google Scholar). But tail-anchored proteins are also located in the mitochondrial outer membrane, and the precise signal that distinguishes these from those targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum is still not clear. Deletion mutagenesis has shown the signal is contained within the tail segment, and in the few different model proteins examined to date critical determinants have been either the presence of charged residues or in some cases the number of hydrophobic residues (8Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 111: 20-24Google Scholar, 9Vergeres G. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12583-12591Google Scholar, 10Borgese N. Gazzoni I. Barberi M. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 243-248Google Scholar, 14Allen R. Egan B. Gabriel K. Beilharz T. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 347-350Google Scholar). An understanding of the precise targeting signals that direct the majority of tail-anchored proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, but allow some to go exclusively to mitochondria, has been hampered by the relatively small number of model tail-anchored proteins that have been available for study. We applied several bioinformatic approaches to identify tail-anchored proteins encoded in the genome ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Fifteen novel tail-anchored proteins were discovered; we report here on the localization of the previously unrecognized tail-anchored proteins. Analysis of the targeting segments from the 55 tail-anchored proteins in yeast suggests a bipartite system of signals: hydrophobic character in the tail segment determines targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum instead of mitochondria and discrete sorting signals that then direct tail-anchored proteins to their correct subcellular destination. DNA fragments corresponding to each open reading frame were amplified by PCR using primers that generated one in-frame restriction site immediately preceding the start codon and another following the stop codon (oligonucleotide sequences available on request). PCR products were cloned behind GFP-S65T under the control of the MET25 promoter and expressed from a centromeric plasmid (13Egan B. Beilharz T. George R. Isenmann S. Gratzer S. Wattenberg B. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 243-248Google Scholar). In semisynthetic (SD) media, expression from the plasmid is partially repressed. PCR-based mutagenesis was used to convert hydrophilic residues in the transmembrane segments of Tom22 and Fis1 to leucine residues. For the mutant described here, Fis1(4L), Gly136, Gly137, Gly141, and Ala142 were converted to leucine residues. Initial trials to visualize expression of the fusion proteins were made in the diploid strain JK9–3da/α (leu2–3,122/leu2–3,122, ura3–52/ura3–52, rme1/rme1 trp1/trp1, his4/his4 GAL+/GAL+, HMLa/HMLa). In three cases, this failed to give discernible fluorescence but expression of fusion proteins constructed from YBL100c, YFL046w, and YPL200c was possible using a strain defective in proteasome function (Matα, trp1, ura3, his, leu2, cim5–1; Ghislainet al. (38Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-362Google Scholar)). To generate yeast mutants lacking theFIS1 gene or the PRM3 gene, PCR-mediated gene disruption (15Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Google Scholar) was employed with the plasmid p3xHA-His5 as template. For fluorescence microscopy, cells were visualized directly or after staining with Mitotracker (MitoTracker Red CM-H2X Ros) according to the standard protocol from Molecular Probes. All fluorescence images were captured using a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal scanning laser microscope mounted on a Zeiss Axioscop. For the mating studies, a Nikon fluorescence microscope with GFP and DAPI filter sets and a ×100 DIC (Nomarski) objective was used. In this case images were captured by a Micromax digital camera with Metamorph imaging software. In preparation for fluorescence microscopy cells were grown to mid-log phase at 25 °C in semisynthetic medium. In assays for nuclear transport, wild-type, rna1-1, orprp20-1 cells were transferred from 25 °C liquid culture to a 37 °C water bath for 30 min immediately prior to preparation for microscopy. Microsomal membrane fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation. Cells (50–100 OD600 units) were suspended in buffer 88 (250 mm sorbitol, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.75 μg/ml antipain, 0.25 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8) and disrupted by two bursts (each of 2-min duration) in a mini-beadbeater-8 (Biospec products) using silica/zirconia beads. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. A crude membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Membranes were extracted by resuspension in either 1% Triton X-100 or 100 mm Na2CO3 and incubated for 30 min on ice with intermittent vortexing. Soluble and insoluble proteins were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g in a Beckman Airfuge. Published procedures were used for isolation of mitochondria and trypsin shaving, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis (16Beilharz T. Suzuki C. Lithgow T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35268-35272Google Scholar). Detailed comparative hydrophobicity analyses of the targeting sequences in each tail-anchored protein made use of the ProtParam site at (expasy.proteome.org.au/cgi-bin/protparam) using a window of 5 amino acids to scan through the predicted transmembrane segment according to the Kyte-Doolittle algorithm. In addition to the tail-anchored proteins known in yeast, sequence analysis revealed 15 open reading frames that could be expressed as GFP fusions that localize to discrete subcellular membranes. Fig.1 shows that Fis1 and YFL046w are mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 1 A), seven proteins localized generally to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Fig. 1 B), and four are localized to specific subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1 C). YLR238w and YOR324c are found in clusters within the bounds of the endoplasmic reticulum, and Prm3 is confined to the perinuclear (nuclear envelope) membrane. YPL206c, a protein showing sequence similarity to bacterial glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases, was found concentrated in lipid bodies, regions of endoplasmic reticulum specialized for lipid metabolism (Fig.1 C; Ref. 17Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Google Scholar). Two proteins closely related in primary structure, YDL012c and YBR016w, are located in the plasma membrane (Fig. 1 D). Both YDL012c and YBR016w are localized more intensely in regions of new membrane synthesis, toward the emergent buds of dividing cells and also in the schmoo structure (Fig.1 E, arrowheads) of haploid cells in the presence of mating pheromone. Comparative sequence analysis of the carboxyl-terminal segments of the 41 tail-anchored proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (including the 17 proteins sorted to other membranes of the secretory pathway) revealed no obvious motifs in the primary structure that might serve as a common targeting signal. However, hydropathy analysis through the transmembrane segments suggests regions of high (>3.3 units) hydropathy score in each protein (Fig.2 A). Conversely, hydropathy analysis of the predicted transmembrane domain from Fis1 (Fig.2 B) and for YFL046w, Tom5, Tom6, Tom7, and Tom22 (data not shown) suggests this segment of each polypeptide is more amphipathic than for proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Previous work has shown that the transmembrane segments of the translocase subunits Tom5, Tom6, Tom7, Tom22, and Fis1 are necessary and sufficient for targeting mitochondria (13Egan B. Beilharz T. George R. Isenmann S. Gratzer S. Wattenberg B. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 243-248Google Scholar, 14Allen R. Egan B. Gabriel K. Beilharz T. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 347-350Google Scholar,18Cao W. Douglas M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 457-461Google Scholar). 2T. Beilharz and T. Lithgow, unpublished observations. To test whether the character in the transmembrane segment of Fis1 distinguished it as a protein destined for mitochondria, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace hydrophilic residues with leucines, such that the hydrophobicity approached that of proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2 B). When yeast cells expressing these mutant proteins as GFP fusions were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy, the Fis1 mutant, Fis1(L4), is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2 C). Similar results were found with mutations made in the transmembrane segment of Tom22 (data not shown). Fluorescence is sometimes also observed in the lumen of the vacuole, perhaps reflecting turnover of the inappropriately targeted proteins (Fig. 2 C, “V”). Tail-anchored proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum can display distinct patterns of localization. For example YOR324c is found in discrete clusters throughout the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3 A), whereas Bos1 is a SNARE found sparingly in the endoplasmic reticulum but enriched in the Golgi (Fig. 3 B, arrows). The hydrophobic tail segments from each of these proteins are sufficient to target GFP to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it remains generally distributed (Fig. 3, C and D). The proteins are integrated into the membrane as judged by their resistance to extraction by sodium carbonate treatment of isolated membranes (Fig.3 E; data not shown). We identified a single protein, Prm3, whose distribution was restricted to the nuclear envelope and sought to understand whether its targeting and sorting were also mediated by bipartite signals. A series of deletion mutants were constructed (Fig.4 A) and tested for subcellular localization. Deletion of 91 amino acids, leaving only the carboxyl-terminal segment of Prm3 (GFP-Prm3Δ1–91), targets the GFP reporter to the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 4 B), which is continuous with the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope (19Prinz W.A. Grzyb L. Veenhuis M. Kahana J.A. Silver P.A. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 461-474Google Scholar). A second signal is present in Prm3(Δ1–68), causing the fusion to be localized specifically to the nuclear envelope (Fig. 4 C). Sequence analysis suggested a nuclearlocalization sequence (NLS) between Pro68 and Lys75. Point mutations in the putative NLS caused degradation of the full-length Prm3 fusion protein, and so to test whether the putative NLS is functional, we analyzed a soluble version, GFP-Prm3(Δ109–133). GFP-Prm3(Δ109–133) is localized exclusively within the nucleus, and confocal sectioning revealed it distributed throughout the nucleoplasm (Fig. 4 D). To be certain the information for nuclear localization is contained within the amino acid sequence P68GRVRKHK75, site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert Lys73 to Ala73, and the mutant protein GFP-Prm3(Δ109–133)* is compromised in import, with much of the protein located in the cytosol (Fig.4 E). If Prm3 has a bipartite targeting sequence, with the P68GRVRKHK75 truly acting as an NLS, the general nuclear import machinery of the cell should be required to maintain the full-length, membrane-embedded Prm3 within the nucleus. Ran is a small GTP-binding protein that plays a critical role in transport of proteins into the nucleus (20Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Google Scholar, 21Kuersten S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 497-503Google Scholar). A gradient of Ran-GTP across the nuclear membrane is established by the differential localization of two enzymes: the Ran-GTPexchange factor (Ran-GEF) in the nucleus and the Ran-GTP-activating protein (Ran-GAP) in the cytosol, and mutations in either of these two enzymes leads to collapse of nuclear traffic. Temperature-sensitive mutants for Ran-GEF (prp20-1) and Ran-GAP (ran1-1) were transformed and the distribution of Prm3 measured by fluorescence microscopy. At the permissive temperature of 25 °C, the localization of Prm3 in the Ran-GEF mutants (Fig. 4 F) and the Ran-GAP mutants (Fig.4 G) is nuclear. However, after shift to the non-permissive temperature of 37 °C, Prm3 is found throughout the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that without a functioning Ran cycle the protein cannot be sorted from the outer to inner membrane of the nuclear envelope. Since Prm3 is the first protein described in yeast that might be localized to the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope, we sought to determine its function by analysis of Δprm3 mutant cells. Haploid yeast cells of opposite mating types, either wild type (Mata) with wild type (Matα) or Δprm3(Mata) with Δprm3 (Matα), were mixed and incubated on rich medium for 3–4 h, then fixed and stained with DAPI to visualize DNA. In wild-type crosses, nuclear DNA is usually mixed by the time the first diploid bud appears near the junction of the two parent cells of the mating pair (Figs.5 A). However, the cytoductants that arise from Δprm3 × Δprm3 crosses are unable to undergo normal karyogamy, and nuclear material remains distinct but tightly juxtaposed at the point where the nuclei simultaneously squeeze through the bud neck, whether staining for nucleic acid (Fig. 5 B) or nucleoplasmic protein (Fig.5 C). If, as suggested by this microscopy, Prm3 is required for the fusion of nuclear envelopes, then Δprm3 cells should remain haploid through subsequent generations. To test this possibility, ten zygotes from mating mixtures like those described in Fig. 5 were isolated by micromanipulation. The progeny from wild-type crosses are diploid: in the course of mitosis they develop bud scars at each end of the ovoid cells (Fig. 5 D), they cannot mate with haploid cells of either mating type, and they will undergo meiosis if placed on sporulation media (data not shown). By contrast, the progeny from Δprm3 × Δprm3 matings were exclusively haploid: the cells that arise mitotically from these cytoductants have a single, spiralled pattern of bud scars (Fig.5 D), cannot be sporulated, but can mate with (wild-type) cells of the opposite mating type (data not shown). The colonies that initially arise from these cytoductants show a distinct furrow, with cells isolated from one side of the furrow exhibiting mating typea and cells from the other side being of mating type α. 3T. Beilharz, unpublished observations. Transcript profiling has shown that the PRM3 gene is induced in response to both pheromone stimulation (22Heiman M.G. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 719-730Google Scholar) and during sporulation (23Yale J. Bohnert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15996-16007Google Scholar), and both processes culminate in karyogamy (see review by Rose (24Rose M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 663-695Google Scholar)). Because Prm3 localization is dependent on a NLS and the Ran-GTPase cycle, we propose Prm3 as the first component of the cellular karyogamy machinery to function in membrane fusion at the level of the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope. In addition to the discovery and localization of a large set of novel tail-anchored proteins, analysis of the sequence data provided by these proteins suggests a general model for the targeting of tail-anchored proteins to each intracellular membrane. From analysis of the 41 tail-anchored proteins now known to localize to membranes of the secretory pathway, the only common property we could identify was the uniformly hydrophobic nature of the residues within the transmembrane segment. Previous studies on individual tail-anchored proteins have each suggested that the tail-segment contains targeting information (8Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 111: 20-24Google Scholar, 9Vergeres G. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12583-12591Google Scholar, 10Borgese N. Gazzoni I. Barberi M. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Mol. Biol.

The hydrophobic tail segments of Bos1, Prm3, and YOR324c are sufficient to target each of these proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, and these truncated fusions remain uniformly distributed through the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (i.e. the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope) and peripheral endoplasmic reticulum. A segment of lower hydrophobic moment, containing glycine, serine, and threonine residues, is found in the six tail-anchored proteins targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Replacement of these residues with leucines, to alter the hydrophobicity and perhaps other structural features such as the rigidity of the helix it can form, prevents targeting to mitochondria. The TOM translocation machinery mediates protein insertion into the outer membrane (25Keil P. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 197-200Google Scholar, 26Millar D.G. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25823-25829Google Scholar, 27Lan L. Isenmann S. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 611-621Google Scholar), as well as the import of soluble proteins into mitochondria (28Schatz G. Nature. 1997; 388: 121-122Google Scholar, 29Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Google Scholar, 30Voos W. Martin H. Krimmer T. Pfanner N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 235-254Google Scholar, 31Gabriel K. Buchanan S.K. Lithgow T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 36-40Google Scholar). The recent three-dimensional structure of the TOM complex receptor subunit, Tom20, suggests that it has only a very shallow binding groove on its surface, into which binds the hydrophobic face of the targeting sequences found attached to soluble proteins targeted to mitochondria (32Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Google Scholar, 33Muto T. Obita T. Abe Y. Shodai T. Endo T. Kohda D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 137-143Google Scholar). Tom20 has been implicated as the import receptor for tail-anchored proteins, and it will be of interest to determine the structural details of how the receptor binds the targeting segments of tail-anchored proteins. In contrast to insertion of tail-anchored proteins into mitochondria, the nature of the machinery that mediates tail-anchored protein insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum is still unclear. Kutayet al. (5Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Google Scholar) suggested that the general post-translational Sec machinery might mediate insertion of tail-anchored proteins like VAMP-1a. Whatever the machinery, it is able to insert tail-anchored proteins with hydrophobic tail-segments; even a simple, artificial tail-segment consisting entirely of leucine residues was a suitable substrate for in vitro insertion into membrane vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (34Whitley P. Grahn E. Kutay U. Rapoport T.A. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7583-7586Google Scholar), and the same tail segment directs GFP to the endoplasmic reticulum when expressed in yeast cells.3 Distinct regions in the cytosolic domain of VAMP-1a assist its subsequent transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the presynaptic vesicles. Interactions mediated by distinct regions in the cytosolic domains are also required for Bos1 trafficking to the Golgi, Prm3 targeting to the nuclear envelope, and YOR324c clustering in punctate zones of the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus two independent processes, targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent sorting to the correct membrane, are mediated by bipartite targeting and sorting signals. For the Golgi and post-Golgi membranes, sorting would be mediated through vesicular traffic. In the case of Prm3 and any other proteins that might exist in the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope, we suggest that this occurs via the lipid rivulets of pore membrane present in the nuclear pore complex (35Allen T.D. Cronshaw J.M. Bagley S. Kiseleva E. Goldberg M.W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1651-1659Google Scholar, 36Georgatos S.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2989-2994Google Scholar) that would link the outer and inner membrane bilayers and is catalyzed by Ran and the karyopherins that also drive the import of soluble nuclear proteins. We thank Ben Glick, Tina Junne-Bieri, and Jeff Schatz for plasmids and antisera; Peter Walsh, Diana Macasev, and Ross Waller for critical suggestions on the manuscript; and Binks Wattenberg and David Huang for comments on the manuscript and critical discussions throughout the course of the project."
https://openalex.org/W2153549293,"We previously demonstrated that cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) elicits Ca2+ release in airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells through ryanodine receptor channels. CD38 is a cell surface protein that catalyzes the synthesis and degradation of cADPR. In inflammatory diseases such as asthma, augmented Ca2+ responses and Ca2+ sensitivity contribute to increased ASM contractility in response to agonists. In this study, we investigated the regulation of CD38 expression and the role of cADPR-mediated Ca2+ release in airway inflammation. Human ASM cells in culture between the second and fifth passages were exposed to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1beta, or interferon gamma, or bovine serum albumin (controls). CD38 expression was measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time PCR, and Western blot analysis, and ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was assayed with nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide as the substrate. Ca2+ responses to acetylcholine, bradykinin, and thrombin were measured in fura-2AM-loaded cells by fluorescence microscopy. Cytokines caused significant augmentation of CD38 expression, ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity, and Ca2+ responses to the agonists, compared with the control. TNF-alpha effects were greater than those of the other two cytokines. The cADPR antagonist 8-bromo-cADPR attenuated the Ca2+ responses to the agonists in control and cytokine-treated cells, with the magnitude of inhibition correlating with the level of CD38. This study provides the first demonstration of a role for CD38-cADPR signaling in a model of inflammatory airway disease."
https://openalex.org/W2164036989,"Dietary use of curcumin, the active component of tumeric, one of the most widely used spices, is linked to several beneficial health effects, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Correlations have been established between curcumin exposure and increases in enzymes for glutathione synthesis, particularly glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), and metabolism as well as glutathione content, suggesting the eliciting of an adaptive response to stress. In this study, using HBE1 cells, we found that the mechanism of curcumin-induced GCL elevation occurred via transcription of the two Gcl genes. Gcl transcription has been shown in several systems to be mediated through binding of transcription factor complexes to TRE and EpRE elements. Studies herein showed that curcumin caused modest but sustained increases in binding of proteins to DNA sequences for both cis elements but, more importantly, altered the compositions and nuclear content of proteins in these complexes. Curcumin exposure increased JunD and c-Jun content in AP-1 complexes and increased JunD while decreasing MafG/MafK in EpRE complexes. Thus, the beneficial effects elicited by curcumin appear to be due to changes in the pool of transcription factors that compose EpRE and AP-1 complexes, affecting gene expression of GCL and other phase II enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2081153915,"Escherichia coli thiol peroxidase (Tpx, p20, scavengase) is part of an oxidative stress defense system that uses reducing equivalents from thioredoxin (Trx1) and thioredoxin reductase to reduce alkyl hydroperoxides. Tpx contains three Cys residues, Cys95, Cys82, and Cys61, and the latter residue aligns with the N-terminal active site Cys of other peroxidases in the peroxiredoxin family. To identify the catalytically important Cys, we have cloned and purified Tpx and four mutants (C61S, C82S, C95S, and C82S,C95S). In rapid reaction kinetic experiments measuring steady-state turnover, C61S is inactive, C95S retains partial activity, and the C82S mutation only slightly affects reaction rates. Furthermore, a sulfenic acid intermediate at Cys61 generated by cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) treatment was detected in UV-visible spectra of 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-labeled C82S,C95S, confirming the identity of Cys61 as the peroxidatic center. In stopped-flow kinetic studies, Tpx and Trx1 form a Michaelis complex during turnover with a catalytic efficiency of 3.0 × 106m−1 s−1, and the low K m (9.0 μm) of Tpx for CHP demonstrates substrate specificity toward alkyl hydroperoxides over H2O2 (K m > 1.7 mm). Rapid inactivation of Tpx due to Cys61overoxidation is observed during turnover with CHP and a lipid hydroperoxide, 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, but not H2O2. Unlike most other 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, which operate by an intersubunit disulfide mechanism, Tpx contains a redox-active intrasubunit disulfide bond yet is homodimeric in solution. Escherichia coli thiol peroxidase (Tpx, p20, scavengase) is part of an oxidative stress defense system that uses reducing equivalents from thioredoxin (Trx1) and thioredoxin reductase to reduce alkyl hydroperoxides. Tpx contains three Cys residues, Cys95, Cys82, and Cys61, and the latter residue aligns with the N-terminal active site Cys of other peroxidases in the peroxiredoxin family. To identify the catalytically important Cys, we have cloned and purified Tpx and four mutants (C61S, C82S, C95S, and C82S,C95S). In rapid reaction kinetic experiments measuring steady-state turnover, C61S is inactive, C95S retains partial activity, and the C82S mutation only slightly affects reaction rates. Furthermore, a sulfenic acid intermediate at Cys61 generated by cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) treatment was detected in UV-visible spectra of 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-labeled C82S,C95S, confirming the identity of Cys61 as the peroxidatic center. In stopped-flow kinetic studies, Tpx and Trx1 form a Michaelis complex during turnover with a catalytic efficiency of 3.0 × 106m−1 s−1, and the low K m (9.0 μm) of Tpx for CHP demonstrates substrate specificity toward alkyl hydroperoxides over H2O2 (K m > 1.7 mm). Rapid inactivation of Tpx due to Cys61overoxidation is observed during turnover with CHP and a lipid hydroperoxide, 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, but not H2O2. Unlike most other 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, which operate by an intersubunit disulfide mechanism, Tpx contains a redox-active intrasubunit disulfide bond yet is homodimeric in solution. Oxidative stress defenses combat reactive oxygen species (1Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Farr S.B. Ames B.N. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 363-368Google Scholar, 2Carmel-Harel O. Storz G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 439-461Google Scholar) such as superoxide (O 2⨪), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the hydroxyl radical (OH⋅) generated by the host immune response, environmental factors, and the incomplete reduction of oxygen to water during aerobic respiration, all of which are hazardous to proteins, DNA, and lipids (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 188-276Google Scholar, 4Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Google Scholar).Escherichia coli protects cellular components from oxidative damage by employing a variety of antioxidant defense enzymes, such as hydroperoxidases (catalases) I and II (gene products of katGand katE, respectively) that decompose H2O2 (5Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. Neidhardt F.C. E. coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology VI. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1526-1538Google Scholar), and superoxide dismutases (manganese superoxide dismutase, sodA; iron superoxide dismutase,sodB; copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, sodC) (6Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Google Scholar) that eliminate O 2⨪. Additional defenses in E. coliagainst alkyl and lipid hydroperoxides are provided by multiple, non-heme peroxidases including 1) the peroxidatic component from the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase system (AhpC) 1The abbreviations used are: AhpC, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase peroxidase component; AhpF, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase flavoprotein oxidoreductase component; Trx, thioredoxin; BCP, bacterioferritin-comigratory protein; Tpx, thiol peroxidase; Prx, peroxiredoxin; Cys-SOH, cysteine sulfenic acid; TrxR, thioredoxin reductase; DTT, dithiothreitol; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); CHP, cumene hydroperoxide; NBD chloride, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; Cys-SO2H, cysteine sulfinic acid; Cys-SO3H, cysteine sulfonic acid; 15-HPETE, 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)-ethane sulfonic acid; TCEP, Tris[2- carboxyethyl]phosphine; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide (7Costa Seaver L. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Google Scholar); 2) a weakly active, thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent bacterioferritin-comigratory protein (BCP) (8Jeong W. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2924-2930Google Scholar); and 3) the periplasmic thiol peroxidase (Tpx, p20, scavengase) (9Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28641Google Scholar). In addition, a glutathione peroxidase homologue, the gene product of btuE(10Rioux C.R. Kadner R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 217: 301-308Google Scholar), has been identified in E. coli, and preliminary investigations have indicated Trx-dependent peroxidatic activity against organic hydroperoxides (ROOH) and H2O2. 2L. M. S. Baker and L. B. Poole, unpublished observations. AhpC, BCP, and Tpx are all members of the ubiquitous peroxiredoxin (Prx) family within the Trx superfamily of protein folds; however, the three E. coli Prx members are highly diverged from one another and are representative of three distinct Prx subfamilies (11Poole L.B. Torres M. Fukuto J.M. Forman H.J. Signal Transduction by Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species: Pathways and Chemical Principles. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2003: 80-101Google Scholar, 12Jin D.-Y. Jeang K.-T. Sen C.K. Sies H. Bauerle P. Antioxidant and Redox Regulation of Genes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego2000: 381-407Google Scholar, 13Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Google Scholar). Generally, the Prx active site contains a disulfide bond composed of a conserved N-terminal Cys (Cys46 fromSalmonella typhimurium AhpC) and the C-terminal Cys (Cys165′ from S. typhimurium AhpC) from the other subunit of the antiparallel dimer, resulting in two symmetrical active sites per dimer (14Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13349-13356Google Scholar). Most Prxs contain two conserved Cys (2-Cys Prxs); however, in some homologues, only the N-terminal Cys is retained (the 1-Cys Prxs) (15Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Google Scholar). In many instances, the homodimers assemble into toroid-shaped decamers (15Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Google Scholar), a redox-dependent process inS. typhimurium AhpC whereby reduced decamers disassociate into dimers upon oxidation (16Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5493-5504Google Scholar). To detoxify peroxides, the reduced N-terminal Cys attacks the peroxide -O–O- bond, with concomitant formation of a Cys sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH) intermediate, which then condenses with the C-terminal Cys to regenerate the stable disulfide bond at the active site (14Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13349-13356Google Scholar, 17Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15013-15018Google Scholar). For most bacterial Prxs, disulfide reduction is achieved by a specialized electron donor, AhpF (18Poole L.B. Reynolds C.M. Wood Z.A. Karplus P.A. Ellis H.R. Li Calzi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6126-6133Google Scholar), whereas many other Prx systems (both bacterial and eukaryotic) receive electrons from a reducing system composed of Trx and Trx reductase (TrxR) (13Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Google Scholar, 15Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Google Scholar). Homologues of tpx are distributed throughout most or all eubacterial species, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive, and are found in pathogenic strains such as Haemophilus influenzae,Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Helicobacter pylori(19Wan X.-Y. Zhou Y. Yan Z.-Y. Wang H.-L. Hou Y.-D. Jin D.-Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 32-36Google Scholar), but biochemical and genetic analyses have been limited primarily to E. coli Tpx. In response to oxidative stress, E. coli up-regulates Tpx expression through an oxygen-responsive promoter element that is repressed by the transcriptional regulators ArcA and Fnr under anaerobic conditions (9Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28641Google Scholar, 20Kim H.K. Kim S.J. Lee J.W. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 641-646Google Scholar, 21Kim S.J. Han Y.H. Kim I.H. Kim H.K. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 215-218Google Scholar). In addition,tpx deletion mutants, while still viable, were more susceptible to oxidative stress and displayed diminished colony sizes and numbers after peroxide exposure (22Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5610-5614Google Scholar). In vitro studies have confirmed that Tpx forms a Trx-linked peroxidase system capable of reducing H2O2 and ROOH and protecting against glutamine synthetase inactivation by a mixed function oxidation system (9Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28641Google Scholar). Tpx contains three Cys residues in its primary sequence, Cys61, Cys82, and Cys95. Of these, Cys61 aligns with the peroxidatic, N-terminal Cys of other Prxs; whereas Cys95 does not align with the conserved C-terminal Cys of other 2-Cys Prxs, it is conserved among all Tpx homologues (19Wan X.-Y. Zhou Y. Yan Z.-Y. Wang H.-L. Hou Y.-D. Jin D.-Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 32-36Google Scholar). Previous mutagenesis studies have presented conflicting information about which Cys residues are involved in peroxide attack and have indicated that both Cys61 and Cys95 are essential for activity, whereas loss of Cys82 only slightly attenuates activity (22Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5610-5614Google Scholar, 23Zhou Y. Wan X.Y. Wang H.L. Yan Z.Y. Hou Y.D. Jin D.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 848-852Google Scholar). In this report, we identify Cys61 as the peroxidatic Cys forming a Cys-SOH intermediate and firmly establish its intrasubunit linkage to Cys95 in the redox-active disulfide. Although Tpx monomers are not covalently linked, analytical ultracentrifugation studies reported herein demonstrate that the enzyme is a homodimer in solution. SDS, ultrapure glycine, ultrapure urea, EDTA disodium salt, dithiothreitol (DTT), ammonium sulfate, β-mercaptoethanol, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), Tris base, and other buffer reagents were purchased from Research Organics (Cleveland, OH).

Vent DNA polymerase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, calf intestinal phosphatase, Taq DNA polymerase, MgCl2 solutions, and restriction buffers were obtained fromPromega (Madison, WI). Agarose medium EEO (electrophoresis grade), organic solvents (high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade), water (optima grade), sodium borate, acetic acid, sodium chloride, and H2O2 were from Fisher. Acrylamide/bis (40%) solution was purchased from Bio-Rad. Ampicillin powder, chloramphenicol, streptomycin sulfate, formic acid, calcium chloride, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), protocatechuic acid, protocatechuate-3,4dioxygenase, lipoxygenase,Saccharomyces cerevisiae glutathione reductase, E. coli glutaredoxin 1, and insulin were from Sigma. Ethyl hydroperoxide was from Polysciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA). Glutathione, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD chloride), 4-vinylpyridine, and tert-butyl hydroperoxide were from Aldrich. NADPH and NADH were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.l-1-(Tosylamino)-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was obtained from Worthington. Pierce supplied the immobilized Tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine (TCEP) disulfide-reducing gel, Gel Code Blue stain, and trifluoroacetic acid ampules. Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) supplied the methyl methanethiolsulfonate and fluorescein-5-maleimide. Arachidonic acid was from NuCheck Prep (Elysian, MN). Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) supplied the PfuTurbo polymerase, DpnI, and E. coli XL-1 Blue competent cells. All ultrafiltration was carried out using Apollo 7-ml high performance centrifugal concentrators (Orbital Biosciences, Topsfield, MA) unless otherwise noted. Genomic DNA prepared from a 400-ml overnight culture of an E. coli K-12 strain (XL-1 Blue) was used as the PCR template (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R.B. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 212-213Google Scholar). The gene of interest was amplified with the following PCR primers: forward primer, 5′-GCGAATTCAGGAGGAAGAATAGATGTCACAAACCGTACATTTCCAGGGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCCTGCAGTTATGCTTTCAGTACAGCC-3′ (engineered restriction sites underlined) synthesized in the DNA Synthesis Core Laboratory of the Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University. PCR mixtures (50 μl) contained 200 μm dNTPs, 2 units of Vent DNA polymerase, 20 pmol each of forward and reverse oligonucleotides, 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.5 μg of genomic DNA. The reaction was carried out in a Mini Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) as follows: 95 °C at 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min (35 cycles) and then 72 °C for 15 min. The 507-bp tpx PCR product purified with the QIAquick PCR Cleanup kit (Qiagen, Studio City, CA) was then ligated into the pCR2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) after Taq DNA polymerase/dNTP treatment. Plasmid DNA purified from the E. coli host using the Wizard Miniprep Kit (Promega) was screened for the presence of insert by digestion with the appropriate restriction enzymes (EcoRI and PstI). The DNA fragment containing tpx was excised from agarose gels and purified using the Gene Clean II Kit (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA). The fragment was ligated using T4 DNA ligase into the pPROK1 expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA; expression under control of the tac promoter) that had been similarly digested, isolated from an agarose gel, and pretreated with calf intestinal phosphatase to generate pPROK1/tpx. The four mutant E. coli Tpx enzymes, C61S, C82S, C95S, and C82S,C95S were created by following the protocol outlined in the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using primers complementary to the coding and noncoding template sequence (pPROK1/tpx) containing a double-base mismatch. To generate the C61S mutation, the forward primer 5′-GATACCGGTGTTTCGGCCGCATCAGTACG-3′ and a complementary reverse primer were used (underlined letters indicate the base pair mismatch). To generate the C95S mutation, the forward primer 5′-CGCCCAGTCTCGTTTCTCGGGCGCAGAAGG-3′ and a complementary reverse primer were employed, and C82S was constructed using the forward primer 5′-CACCGTTGTGCTGTCTATCTCTGCCGATCTGCC-3′ and its complementary reverse primer. C82S,C95S was created using C95S plasmid as template with the forward and reverse primers for the C82S mutation. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 10–50 ng of template DNA (pPROK1/tpx or pPROK1/tpxC95S), 125 ng of each primer, 200 μm dNTPs, and 1 μl of PfuTurbo polymerase. Twelve cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 55 °C for 13 min were carried out in a Mini Cycler followed by 55 °C for 10 min to finish extending products. To digest methylated template, each reaction mixture was treated with 1 μl of DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h. Ligated DNA (pPROK1/tpx) and mutagenesis products were transformed into XL-1 Blue cells. Single colonies were selected on Luria-Bertani (LB) plates containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml), and those containing the recombinant DNA were evaluated for protein expression by SDS-PAGE after induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Isolated plasmid DNA for each construct was sequenced throughout the coding region by automated DNA sequencing at the Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University. Bacterial stocks containing each plasmid with the subcloned gene were prepared from a single colony and stored at −80 °C in LB broth containing 15% (v/v) glycerol. Culture procedures were generally the same as reported earlier (25Poole L.B. Ellis H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 56-64Google Scholar). A modification of a previous Tpx purification protocol was used for this study (9Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28641Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out in a standard buffer (pH 7.0) consisting of 25 mm potassium phosphate with 1.0 mm EDTA. Briefly, 100 ml of XL-1 Blue E. coliharboring the pPROK1/tpx plasmid were added to 10 liters of LB medium containing 0.5 g of ampicillin supplemented with 0.2% glucose in a BioFlo 2000 fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ). Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.4 mm) was added at A 600 = 0.9, and bacteria were harvested by centrifugation 16 h after induction. Pelleted bacteria were disrupted with a Bead Beater (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK), and cell extracts treated with streptomycin sulfate to precipitate nucleic acids were subjected to 30 and 75% (NH4)2SO4 treatments to precipitate proteins (25Poole L.B. Ellis H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 56-64Google Scholar). The protein mixture resuspended in standard buffer containing 10% (NH4)2SO4 was applied to a 24 × 2.5-cm Phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow Column (Amersham Biosciences), washed with 10% (NH4)2SO4 buffer, and eluted with deionized H2O. Protein fractions were evaluated for contamination of overexpressed Tpx by SDS-PAGE, and the purest fractions were pooled. After dialysis against 5 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), the protein was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in 5 mm potassium phosphate and eluted with a linear gradient from 5 to 30 mm potassium phosphate (1 liter total volume). Again, fractions were analyzed for Tpx by SDS-PAGE, and the pure fractions were pooled, concentrated, and aliquotted for storage at −20 °C. Purifications of mutant Tpx proteins were carried out in the same manner as for wild type Tpx with a few exceptions. The pooled C61S mutant Tpx protein from the Phenyl-Sepharose column was loaded onto a 24 × 2.5-cm DEAE-cellulose column (DE52; Whatman, Kent, UK) equilibrated with 30 mm potassium phosphate, and eluted with a linear gradient from 30 to 80 mm potassium phosphate (1 liter total volume). To completely purify C61S, fractions containing the mutant protein were reapplied to the Phenyl-Sepharose and DEAE-cellulose columns. Initial attempts at purifying the C95S mutant under the same conditions as wild type resulted in aggregation of the mutant protein, as observed by multiple bands during SDS-PAGE of the subsequent fractions, even after many rounds of purification over the two columns. DTNB titration of the isolated protein even after DTT treatment gave less than one thiol (data not shown), suggesting that Cys61 had become irreversibly overoxidized to a sulfinic (Cys-SO2H) or sulfonic (Cys-SO3H) acid. The addition of 2 mm DTT to all buffers prior to bacterial disruption and over the course of the purification of C95S gave pure protein after one round of purification on the two columns. C82S was purified in buffers containing 2 mm DTT according to the same protocol as C95S; however, pure C82S,C95S was obtained using a slightly altered protocol. 20% instead of 10% (NH4)2SO4 was used to treat C82S,C95S prior to its application to a Phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20% (NH4)2SO4, and C82S,C95S was eluted using a gradient of 20% (NH4)2SO4 in 25 mmpotassium phosphate with 2 mm DTT to 0% (NH4)2SO4 in deionized water with 2 mm DTT. Elution from the Q Sepharose column was achieved with a gradient of 20–120 mm potassium phosphate in 2 mm DTT. Prior to assay, each mutant was subjected to ultrafiltration and washed with standard buffer to remove DTT and then immediately incubated with equal volumes of TCEP gel. Purifications of E. coli TrxR (26Poole L.B. Godzik A. Nayeem A. Schmitt J.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6602-6615Google Scholar) and E. coli Trx1 (27Reynolds C.M. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8859-8869Google Scholar) were carried out as described previously. S. typhimurium AhpF and S. typhimurium AhpC were purified as reported previously (25Poole L.B. Ellis H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 56-64Google Scholar). Wild type, C61S, C82S, C95S, and C81S,C95S Tpx (100 μg each), prereduced with DTT that was removed by ultrafiltration, were reacted with fluorescein- 5-maleimide (10 equivalents) under denaturing (4 m urea) and reducing (100 eq of TCEP) conditions for 16 h at 4 °C in standard buffer. Protein samples (5 μg) were separated on 18%, 20-cm-long SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Densitometry to assess the protein contents of fluorescein-labeled bands was conducted using the Quantity One quantitation software from Bio-Rad, and image files were generated with a ChemiImager 5500 digital imaging system from Alpha Innotech Corp. (San Leandro, CA) and a near UV light source and UV filter. For quantitation, six amounts of wild type Tpx (0.03–5 μg) were electrophoresed along with each of the mutant samples. Electrophoresis samples also included one with 5 μg of C61S, to which 0.25 μg of wild type Tpx was intentionally added, and one into which 1.7 μg each of wild type Tpx and C61S and C82S,C95S mutants were loaded to assess the quality of the separation. The labeled proteins were also submitted for electrospray mass spectrometry, as described below, following ultrafiltration into water to remove buffer using Apollo concentrators (Orbital Biosciences). To determine the oligomeric state of wild type and mutant proteins, samples of different concentrations were analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium at various speeds on an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) outfitted with absorbance optics. Tpx, C61S, and C95S (purified in DTT) were exchanged into a buffer of 25 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.05, via ultrafiltration. Three different concentrations of each protein (39.5, 184.2, and 342.1 μm) in 110 μl were loaded into three of the six sectors of each cell, and buffer (125 μl) was loaded into the remaining sectors as a reference. Data were obtained at 11,000, 16,000, and 20,000 rpm at 20 °C following equilibration for 8, 10, and 12 h at each speed. Data with absorbances higher than 1.4 were excluded from data analysis. The partial specific volumes for Tpx and the mutants were calculated from the amino acid composition to be 0.7433 cm3 g−1 and 0.7434 cm3g−1, respectively (28Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton C.J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Multiple data sets were globally fit to the equation for a single ideal species using WinNonLin2 (29Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Google Scholar). The buffer density of 1.00773 g/cm3 was determined using a DA-310 M precision density meter (Mettler Toledo, Hightstown, NJ) at 20 °C. Protein samples were extensively dialyzed in deionized water (6 liters) in a Slide-A-Lyzer cassette (Pierce) overnight prior to analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS; Micromass, Manchester, UK) precalibrated with horse heart myoglobin. The protein sample (1 μm) in 1% formic acid was injected at a flow rate of 300 μl/h, and positively charged ions in the m/zrange of 800–1800 were analyzed using MassLynx software (version 3.5; Micromass). Most spectral assays were conducted on a single wavelength, thermostatted (25 °C) Gilford 220 updated recording spectrophotometer (Oberlin, OH) with a Beckman DU monochrometer (Fullerton, CA) unless otherwise noted. Microbiuret assays for proteins to determine extinction coefficients, disulfide assays with 2-nitro-5-thiosulfobenzoate, and thiol quantification with DTNB were conducted as described previously (25Poole L.B. Ellis H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 56-64Google Scholar, 30Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 65-75Google Scholar). To further quantify Tpx proteins by absorbance, the following experimentally determined extinction coefficients at 280 nm were used: Tpx and C82S,C95S, 3800 ± 300 m−1cm−1; C95S, 3500 ± 200 m−1cm−1; C82S, 4200 ± 600 m−1cm−1; C61S, 5300 ± 700 m−1cm−1. Other extinction coefficients used were as follows:E. coli TrxR, 11,300 m−1cm−1 (454 nm) (31Williams Jr., C.H. Zanetti G. Arscott L.D. McAllister J.K. J. Biol.

Michaelis constants (K m) and turnover numbers (k cat) with CHP as the substrate for Tpx were obtained as described previously for H. pylori TrxR (35Baker L.M. Raudonikiene A. Hoffman P.S. Poole L.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1961-1973Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were conducted on an Applied Photophysics DX-17 MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Surrey, UK) at 25 °C, and activity was followed by monitoring the decrease in fluorescence or absorbance of NADPH over time. Use of the stopped-flow spectrophotometer for mixing and data acquisition helped alleviate nonlinearity and reproducibility problems inherent in the manual mixing methods (14Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13349-13356Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures in one syringe contained NADPH (150 μm), Trx1 (2–80 μm), TrxR (0.25–10 μm, in a molar ratio of 1:8 TrxR to Trx1, so that the electron transfer to Trx1 is not rate-limiting), and Tpx (0.2 μm) in peroxidase buffer consisting of 50 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1 m(NH4)2SO4, and 0.5 mmEDTA. CHP (1–50 μm) was prediluted into Me2SO (in a ratio of 1:50 with the solvent) and mixed with peroxidase buffer in the other syringe. In all cases, concentrations given are final concentrations achieved after mixing of the contents of the two different syringes. Under the conditions given, Tpx was supplied in rate-limiting concentrations, and due to the saturable interaction between Tpx and Trx1, the reaction was linearly dependent on Trx1, provided that concentrations supplied were below theK m. Assays were designed so that Trx1 levels were at least 10-fold higher than those of Tpx to maintain the peroxidase as the limiting enzyme. Flavin-dependent oxidase activity did not contribute significantly to NADPH oxidation (0.05 s−1) and was not subtracted from initial rates. After conversion to concentration units/min, the primary rate data were fit to a rectangular hyperbolic curve function in Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). The data obtained for each substrate concentration were plotted according to the Hanes-Woolf representation of the Michaelis-Menten equation to give intersecting lines at they axis, indicating a substituted (ping-pong) mechanism and were further evaluated using the Hanes-Woolf equation for a two-substrate, substituted reaction as previously described (35Baker L.M. Raudonikiene A. Hoffman P.S. Poole L.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1961-1973Google Scholar). Because of the much larger K m of Tpx for H2O2, larger amounts of substrates were present in the reaction mixtures, and the sensitivity required previously in the fluorescence assay was no longer necessary. Therefore, all H2O2 data were collected in absorbance mode on the stopped flow spectrophotometer with the same protein assay mixtures as above, except that the second syringe contained varying H2O2 concentrations (0.25–10 mm). Synthesis of 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE) was carried out as described by O'Flaherty et al. (36O'Flaherty J.T. Wykle R.L. Thomas M.J. McCall C.E. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol.

Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 339-345Google Scholar). Enhancement of TNF cytotoxicity by WOX1 is due, in part, to its significant down-regulation of the apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL but up-regulation of proapoptotic p53 (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar, 2Chang N.-S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 9: 19-24Google Scholar). WOX1 physically interacts with p53, and these proteins mediate apoptosis synergistically (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar, 2Chang N.-S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 9: 19-24Google Scholar). Blocking of WOX1 expression by antisense mRNA abolishes p53 apoptosis, suggesting that WOX1 is a potential partner of p53 in apoptosis (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar). Interestingly, hyaluronidases PH-20, Hyal-1, and Hyal-2 induce WOX1 expression and enhance TNF cytotoxicity (4Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Google Scholar, 5Chang N.-S. BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 8Google Scholar). The WWOX gene coding for human WOX1 is mapped to a fragile site on the chromosome ch16q (for reviews, see Refs. 2Chang N.-S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 9: 19-24Google Scholar and 3Richards R.I. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 339-345Google Scholar). High frequency of loss of heterozygosity of this chromosomal region has been shown in breast (6Driouch K. Dorion-Bonnet F. Briffod M. Champeme M.H. Longy M. Lidereau R. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1997; 19: 185-191Google Scholar) and prostate cancers (7Suzuki H. Komiya A. Emi M. Kuramochi H. Shiraishi T. Yatani R. Shimazaki J.

Bergerheim U.S. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1999; 24: 175-182Google Scholar). This chromosome region appears to confer suppression of the metastatic activity in a prostatic cancer cell line (9Mashimo T. Watabe M. Cuthbert A.P. Newbold R.F. Rinker-Schaeffer C.W. Helfer E. Watabe K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4572-4576Google Scholar). Both in vitro and in vivoexperiments showed that WOX1 could act as a tumor suppressor (10Bednarek A.K. Keck-Waggoner C.L. Daniel R.L. Laflin K.J. Bergsagel P.L. Kiguchi K. Brenner A.J. Aldaz C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8068-8073Google Scholar). WOX1 (46 kDa) possesses two N-terminal WW domains (containing conserved tryptophan residues), a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and a C-terminal short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) domain (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar). The human WWOX gene has nine exons. At least seven alternatively spliced human WOX protein variants have been found. The ADH domain region, which is encoded by exons 4–8, is frequently deleted or alternatively spliced in the variants. In contrast, the WW domain region is rarely deleted, and its amino acid sequence is highly conserved among humans, mice, and rats. However, inDrosophila, the sequence of the N-terminal WW domain region is altered (11Paige A.J. Taylor K.J. Taylor C. Hillier S.G. Farrington S. Scott D. Porteous D.J. Smyth J.F. Gabra H. Watson J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11417-11422Google Scholar). A portion of cytosolic WOX1 is located in the mitochondria, and the mitochondrial targeting sequence was mapped within the ADH domain (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar). Induction of mitochondrial permeability transition by TNF, staurosporine, and atractyloside results in WOX1 release from the mitochondria and subsequent nuclear translocation (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar, 2Chang N.-S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 9: 19-24Google Scholar). c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is involved in cellular stress response and has been implicated in both cell growth and apoptosis (for a review, see Ref. 12Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar). JNK1 is involved in signaling pathways that initiate cell cycle checkpoints and cell cycle progression (13MacCorkle-Chosnek R.A. VanHooser A. Goodrich D.W. Brinkley B.R. Tan T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 173-180Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway prevents death of trophic factor-deprived neurons (14Harris C.A. Deshmukh M. Tsui-Pierchala B. Maroney A.C. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 103-113Google Scholar). Persistent activation of JNK1 causes apoptosis (15Kobayashi K. Tsukamoto I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1537: 79-88Google Scholar). However, early activation of JNK1 is essential for protecting cells against TNF-mediated apoptosis (16Roulston A. Reinhard C. Amiri P. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Google Scholar, 17Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 107-112Google Scholar). Transient activation of JNK by growth factors promotes survival of human thyrocytes (18Shklyaev S.S. Namba H. Mitsutake N. Alipov G. Nagayama Y. Maeda S. Ohtsuru A. Tsubouchi H. Yamashita S. Thyroid. 2001; 11: 629-636Google Scholar). Notably, hyaluronidase activation of JNK1 and JNK2 protects L929 fibroblasts from staurosporine-mediated cell death (19Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 278-286Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that anisomycin and UV light activated JNK1 and induced WOX1 phosphorylation in Tyr33, and both proteins physically interacted. Ectopic JNK1 inhibited WOX1-mediated apoptosis of L929 fibroblasts, monocytic U937 cells, and other tested cells. Also, WOX1 prevention of cell cycle progression was abolished by JNK1. The mechanisms of JNK1 and WOX1 binding interaction and the functional significance of this interaction were investigated. Cell lines used in these studies were murine L929 fibroblasts, human monocytic U937 cells, human prostate Du145 cells, and human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. These cells were grown according to the instructions of the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Expression constructs for the murine wild type Wox1 cDNA (sense and antisense directions) and a nuclear localization mutant Wox1mtNLS were established as previously described (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar). These constructs were made in pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The expressed proteins were tagged with an N-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein. The FLAG-tagged wild type JNK1 (pcDNA3-Flag-JNK1) and dominant negative JNK1 (DN-JNK1 or pcDNA3-Flag-JNK1apf) expression constructs were kind gifts of Dr. Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA). The HA-tagged wild type JNK2 and JNK3 (peVRFO-HA-JNK2 and peVRFO-HA-SAPKβ) and dominant negative JNK2 and JNK3 (peVRFO-HA-JNK2-K55R and peVRFO-HA-SAPKβ-K55R or DN-JNK2 and DN-JNK3) were kind gifts of Dr. Michael Kracht (Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany). Where indicated, L929 cells were electroporated with the wild type or DN-JNK constructs (20 μg of DNA/3 × 106 cells; 200 V and 50 ms; BTX ECM 830 Square Wave Electroporator; Genetronics, San Diego, CA). Electroporation caused immediate cell death (or necrosis) by ∼20–40%. These electroporated cells were seeded and cultured on 60-mm Petri dishes (Corning Glass) overnight. The culture supernatants were discarded to remove dead cells. The cells were fed with fresh medium (RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum) and then treated with or without bovine testicular hyaluronidase (100 units/ml; Sigma) for 24 h. The cell layers, reaching 80–90% confluence in 48 h, were gently washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, treated with 70% ethanol, harvested by repeat pipetting, precipitated by centrifugation (500 × g), and then stained with propidium iodide. The cellular DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). In some experiments, L929 and other cells were electroporated with WOX1 and/or JNK1 constructs and cultured for 24 h (in eight replicates). The extent of cell death was examined by crystal violet staining (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar) or by Promega's MTS proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Antibody against the N-terminal amino acid sequence of WOX1 was generated as previously described (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar). Commercial antibodies used in the Western blotting were against JNK1 and a phospho-JNK1 peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Co-immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar,20Chang N.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10323-10331Google Scholar). Briefly, U937, L929, or SK-N-SH cells were treated with anisomycin (100 μm) for various indicated times to activate JNK1. The cytosolic and nuclear fractions of these cells were prepared using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). Endogenous JNK1 was precipitated by the specific anti-JNK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-agarose beads (Pierce), followed by separation in SDS-PAGE and detection by immunostaining. Co-presence of WOX1 in the precipitates was examined similarly by immunostaining. Alternatively, immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-WOX1 or p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. Generation of antibody against synthetic peptides in rabbits was performed as described (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide NH2-CKDGWVpYYANHTEEKT-COOH, with tyrosine 33 phosphorylation (pY), was made (Genemed Synthesis, South San Francisco, CA). A control peptide without phosphorylation was made also. The N-terminal cysteine was added to allow the peptide to covalently conjugate to keyhole limpet hemocyanin for immunization or to SulfoLink beads for antibody purification (Pierce). The peptide sequence is located at the first WW domain of murine WOX1 (amino acids 28–38). Antibody generation was performed using the EZ antibody production and purification kit (Pierce). The antiserum was preadsorbed with a column covalently conjugated with the control peptide, and then the antibody was purified by affinity chromatography using a column immobilized with the synthetic phosphopeptide. The Ras rescue-based CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for protein binding interaction was used (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar, 20Chang N.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10323-10331Google Scholar). Briefly, binding of a cytosolic Sos-tagged bait protein to a cell membrane-anchored target protein (tagged with a myristoylation signal) results in activation of the Ras signaling pathway in yeast. Activation of the Ras signaling pathway allows mutant yeast Cdc25H to grow in 37 °C using a selective agarose plate containing galactose. Without binding, yeast cells fail to grow at 37 °C. The human JNK1 cDNA was constructed in a pMyr vector and utilized as target. The bait constructs in a pSos vector for binding interactions with JNK1 were murine Wox1 (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar), human WOX3 (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar), and the first WW domain of murine Wox1 (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar). Additional constructs for control experiments were human p53 in pMyr, MafB in both pMyr and pSos, collagenase in pSos, and lamin C in pMyr (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar, 20Chang N.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10323-10331Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Tyr33 in WOX3 was mutated to Arg33 (designated Y33R) using the following primers by PCR: forward, 5′-AAGGACGGCTGGGTTCGATACGCCAATCACACC; reverse, 5′-GGTGTGATTGGCGTATCGAACCCAGCCGTCCTT. Lys28 and Asp29 in Wox1 were mutated to Thr28and Val29 (designated K28T/D29V): forward, 5′-AGAGAACCACCACGGTCGGCTGGGTGTACT; reverse, 5′-AGTACACCCAGCCGACCGTGGTGGTTCTCT. Where indicated, Student's t tests were performed to analyze the experimental data (using the Microsoft Excel program). All experiments indicated above were performed 2–5 times. In most cases, a representative set of data is shown. Bovine testicular hyaluronidase PH-20 activates JNK1 in L929 fibroblasts (19Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 278-286Google Scholar). PH-20 promotes the proliferation of L929 cells (4Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Google Scholar). By measuring cellular DNA content using flow cytometry, PH-20 was shown to increase cell cycle progression toward the S and G2/M phases during 24-h exposure (Fig.1). No PH-20-mediated apoptosis or cell death was observed (Sub G0/G1) (Fig. 1). To examine the possible role of JNK1 in the PH-20-mediated growth regulation, L929 cells were electroporated with a wild type human JNK1 or a dominant negative JNK1 construct. The cells were cultured overnight, exposed to PH-20 for 24 h, and then subjected to cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. In controls, the cells were electroporated with nothing (or medium only) and treated similarly. The results showed that ectopic wild type JNK1 did not induce apoptosis or death of L929 cells (Fig. 2). Exposure of these JNK1-expressing cells to PH-20 could not induce apoptosis (Fig.2). In contrast, dominant-negative JNK1 significantly induced L929 cell death (56.4%), and PH-20 did not significantly increase the extent of cell death (60.9%) (Fig. 2). In comparison, ectopic human wild-type JNK2 and JNK3 mediated apoptosis or death of L929 cells by ∼30%, and PH-20 limitedly increased the cell death (∼40%) (Fig. 2). In contrast, dominant negative JNK2 and JNK3 significantly mediated cell death up to 60–70%, and PH-20 slightly increased the cell death (Fig. 2). PH-20 induces the expression of proapoptotic p53 and WOX1 in L929 cells, thereby increasing cellular sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of TNF (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar). Nonetheless, PH-20 also activates JNK1 in these cells (19Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 278-286Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether JNK1 inhibited WOX1-mediated apoptosis of L929 cells. In agreement with our previous observations (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar), electroporation of L929 cells with a wild-type WOX1 expression construct (tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein) resulted in cell death (Fig.3). The extent of cell death was determined by the MTS assay. Similar results were observed by staining the cells with crystal violet (data not shown). The extent of WOX1 protein expression was ∼60–75% in L929 cells, as determined by counting cells under fluorescence microscopy. When L929 cells were cotransfected with both wild type JNK1 and WOX1 constructs, and JNK1 blocked WOX1-mediated cell death (Fig. 3). In contrast, WOX1mtNLS, which possesses a mutated sequence at the NLS, had a significantly reduced activity in mediating cell death (Fig. 3). When in combination, JNK1 and WOX1mtNLS could not induce cell death (Fig.3). The mutation in WOX1mtNLS prevents nuclear translocation of this protein (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar). In agreement with our previous observations (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar), expression of antisense WOX1 mRNA in L929 cells failed to result in cell death, and JNK1 had no effect in mediating cell death during cotransfection (Fig. 3). Together, WOX1 mediates apoptosis in the nucleus, and JNK1 blocks the WOX1-mediated cell death at the nuclear level. To further verify the above observations, we examined the ability of wild type JNK1 in blocking apoptosis of monocytic U937 cells by WOX1. U937 cells were electroporated with various amounts of WOX1 in the presence or absence of wild type JNK1. The cells were cultured 48 h and subjected to cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. The results showed that WOX1-mediated apoptosis was suppressed by JNK1 (see the sub-G0/G1 phase) (Fig. 4). Additionally, WOX1-mediated reduction of cellular distribution in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases was reversed by JNK1 (Fig. 4). Thus, our data strongly support the protective role of JNK1 in blocking WOX1-mediated cell death. We investigated whether JNK1 physically interacts with WOX1, thereby blocking WOX1-mediated apoptosis. As determined by yeast two-hybrid analysis (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar, 20Chang N.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10323-10331Google Scholar), the wild type human JNK1 interacted with murine WOX1 and human WOX3in vivo, as evidenced by the growth of mutant Cdc25H yeast at 37 °C (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the WOX3/JNK1 binding interaction promoted a strong yeast cell growth, compared with that of the WOX1/JNK1 interaction (Fig. 5). Human WOX3 has a deletion of its ADH domain at the C-terminus, whereas itsN-terminal WW domain region is highly homologous to that of murine WOX1 (Fig. 5) (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar). The first WW domain also interacted with JNK1 (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the first WW domain is responsible for binding to JNK1. A conserved phosphorylation site at the first WW domain, Tyr33, was then altered to arginine in WOX3. This mutant, designated WOX3(Y33R), could not interact with JNK1 (Fig. 5). The observations further suggest that phosphorylation at Tyr33 is essential for WOX1 and JNK1 binding interaction. In positive control experiments, the binding interactions between p53 and WOX1 (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar) and the self-binding interaction of MafB were demonstrated (Fig. 5). In negative controls, no binding interactions were observed when testing empty pSos vector versus empty pMyr vector, or collagenase versus lamin C (Fig. 5). To further verify the above observations, U937 cells were treated with anisomycin to activate JNK1. Anisomycin is a potent activator of JNK1 (17Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 107-112Google Scholar). In resting cells, no JNK1 and WOX1 binding interaction was observed, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation using specific anti-JNK1 antibody (Fig. 6 A). Upon stimulation of cells with anisomycin for 30 min, expression of JNK1 was increased, and a portion of JNK1 interacted with WOX1 (Fig. 6 A). Similarly, exposure of SK-N-SH cells to anisomycin for 30 min also resulted in an increased binding interaction between JNK1 and WOX1, as determined using anti-WOX1 antibody in co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.6 B). Similar results were observed when L929 cells were treated with anisomycin, or the above cells were exposed to UV light (data not shown). To further verify Tyr33 phosphorylation in WOX1, we synthesized a peptide containing phospho-Tyr33 for immunization in rabbits. Anisomycin rapidly increased Tyr33phosphorylation in WOX1, as well as JNK1 phosphorylation, in SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 7 A). Similar results were observed using L929 and U937 cells (data not shown). Exposure of L929 cells to UV light, followed by growing for 1 h, resulted in increased p53 expression (Fig. 7 B). p53 is known to interact with WOX1 (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar) and JNK1 (21Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Pincus M.R. Ronai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10541-10546Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of p53 with a specific antibody resulted in the presence of p53, JNK1, and phosphorylated WOX1 in the precipitates (Fig. 7 B). We developed a dominant-negative WOX1. Lys28 and Asp29 inWox1 were mutated to Thr28 and Val29, respectively. These residues are located at the first WW domain. In agreement with our previous observations (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar), p53 and WOX1 mediated U937 cell death in a synergistic manner, and antisense WOX1 abolished p53-mediated cell death (Fig.8 A). The mutated full-length WOX1 (WOX1mt) abolished p53 apoptosis (Fig. 8 A). Similarly, the mutated WW domain region (WOX1wwmt) also abolished p53 apoptosis (Fig. 8 A). These data support the dominant negative effect of the generated WOX1 mutant. Anisomycin-mediated WOX1 phosphorylation in Tyr33 was abolished by the dominant negative WOX1 (Fig. 8 B). SK-N-SH cells were transfected with a GFP-tagged WOX1wwmt or a control GFP construct by electroporation. The cells were cultured for 48 h and then treated with anisomycin for 30 min. The dominant negative WOX1wwmt abolished anisomycin-mediated WOX1 phosphorylation in Tyr33(Fig. 8 B). However, WOX1wwmt failed to inhibit anisomycin-induced JNK1 activation (Fig. 8 B). By yeast two-hybrid analysis, both WOX1mt and WOX1wwmt physically interacted with p53, whereas WOX1wwmt could not bind JNK1 (Fig.8 C). Apparently, these dominant negative WOX1 proteins have an altered conformation, and inhibition of p53 apoptosis by the dominant negatives is due to a direct binding interaction. In contrast, these dominant negatives failed to bind and prevent JNK1 activation. Overexpression of the WW domain region of WOX1, designated WOX1ww, induces cell death (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar). Alteration of Tyr33 to Arg33 was performed in WOX1ww, and the resulting mutant, WOX1ww(Y33R), had a significantly reduced activity (∼50% decrease) in mediating death of L929 and Du145 cells (Fig.9). The findings were also observed using U937, SK-N-SH, and other types of cells (data not shown). JNK1 significantly blocked WOX1ww-mediated death of L929 and Du145 cells by 30–50% (Fig. 9). Interestingly, JNK1 increased the apoptotic function of WOX1ww(Y33R) mutant in L929 but not in Du145 cells (Fig. 9). In this study, we demonstrated that stress stimuli such as anisomycin and UV light mediated WOX1 phosphorylation at Tyr4. The phosphorylation is essential for functional activation of WOX1 in mediating apoptosis. Alteration of Tyr33 to Arg33 reduced the WOX1 activity. In agreement with our previous observations (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar), WOX1-mediated apoptosis occurs at the nuclear level. Mutation of the nuclear localization signal reduced the WOX1 apoptotic function. We determined that ectopic JNK1 counteracted WOX1-mediated apoptosis, as well as cell cycle progression. By stimulating cells with anisomycin, JNK1 became activated and physically interacted with the Tyr33-phosphorylated WOX1, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. A dominant negative WOX1 blocked p53-mediated apoptosis and anisomycin-mediated WOX1 phosphorylation but failed to inhibit JNK1 activation. This dominant negative WOX1 bound p53 but could not interact with JNK1, as determined in yeast two-hybrid analysis. Together, these observations indicate that a physical contact between activated or phosphorylated WOX1 and JNK1 is essential for their functional antagonism. How JNK1 inhibits WOX1 function remains to be determined. The upstream kinase that phosphorylates WOX1 is unknown. Nonetheless, we do not exclude the possibility that activated JNK1 binds WOX1 and then phosphorylates WOX1. Alternatively, an unknown kinase phosphorylates WOX1 in response to stress stimuli. The phosphorylated WOX1 then interacts with JNK1. The dominant negative WOX1 bound p53 and blocked p53 apoptosis. Also, this mutant protein inhibited WOX1 phosphorylation, suggesting its possible interaction with the wild type WOX1. This potential binding interaction remains to be determined by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid analysis. An additional conserved phosphorylation site in WOX1 is Tyr61. Alteration of this residue to Arg61results in abrogation of the binding interaction between WOX1 and p53 in yeast. 2N.-S. Chang, J. Doherty, and A. Ensign, unpublished results. Thus, it is likely that both Tyr33 and Tyr61 in WOX1 are phosphorylated when cells are exposed to stress stimuli. Functional significance of Tyr61 phosphorylation in WOX1 is being determined in this laboratory. The functional property of WOX3 in vivo and in vitro is unknown. Whether WOX3 expression is increased during stress response is unknown. By RT-PCR and Northern blot, Driouch demonstrated that about 50% of breast tumors have overexpressed WOX1 and WOX3 (22Driouch K. Prydz H. Monese R. Johansen H. Lidereau R. Frengen E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1832-1840Google Scholar). WOX1 appears to have a tumor suppressor function (10Bednarek A.K. Keck-Waggoner C.L. Daniel R.L. Laflin K.J. Bergsagel P.L. Kiguchi K. Brenner A.J. Aldaz C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8068-8073Google Scholar,11Paige A.J. Taylor K.J. Taylor C. Hillier S.G. Farrington S. Scott D. Porteous D.J. Smyth J.F. Gabra H. Watson J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11417-11422Google Scholar). Presumably, the overexpressed WOX3 enhances cancer growth by neutralizing the WOX1 function. In addition to activate JNK1, anisomycin inhibits protein synthesis and mediates apoptosis (23Kageyama A. Kusano I. Tamura T. Oda T. Muramatsu T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 835-839Google Scholar, 24Stadheim T.A. Kucera G.L. Leuk. Res. 2002; 26: 55-65Google Scholar). Anisomycin-mediated apoptosis of leukemia HL-60 cells depends upon JNK1 (24Stadheim T.A. Kucera G.L. Leuk. Res. 2002; 26: 55-65Google Scholar). Most interestingly, ansiomycin-activated JNK1 phosphorylates Bcl-2, thereby increasing cell survival (25Deng X. Xiao L. Lang W. Gao F. Ruvolo P. May Jr., W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23681-23688Google Scholar). Previously, we found that when L929 cells were exposed to anisomycin for less than 1 h, these cells became resistant to TNF cytotoxicity (17Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 107-112Google Scholar). We determined that IκBα, the inhibitor of NF-κB, maintains the basal level of JNK1 activation and regulates JNK1-mediated TNF resistance (17Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 107-112Google Scholar). However, whether this protective event is related to JNK1-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation remains to be determined. Hyaluronidase PH-20 activates JNK1, and the activation is necessary to prevent L929 cell death by various anticancer drugs such as staurosporine, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin (19Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 278-286Google Scholar). In contrast, PH-20 increases L929 cell sensitivity to TNF cytotoxicity by increasing the expression of WOX1 (1Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Google Scholar). Apparently, different mechanisms are involved in the regulation of cellular sensitivity to TNF and anticancer drugs. Indeed, we determined that ectopic JNK1 and exogenous PH-20 act synergistically in blocking L929 cell death by WOX1 in the presence of staurosporine, daunorubicin, or doxorubicin.2 We believe that PH-20 activates both endogenous and ectopic JNK1 that block the cell death. Whether JNK1 mediates Bcl-2 phosphorylation in these tested cells is unknown. The hyaluronidase HYAL1 gene, also known asLUCA1, is a candidate tumor suppressor (for a review, see Ref. 26Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Google Scholar). Inactivation of the HYAL1 gene by aberrant splicing of pre-mRNA has been shown in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (27Frost G.I. Mohapatra G. Wong T.M. Csoka A.B. Gray J.W. Stern R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 870-877Google Scholar). Nonetheless, overexpressed hyaluronidases are frequently associated with metastatic cancers (28Lokeshwar V.B. Rubinowicz D. Schroeder G.L. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Block N.L. Nadji M. Lokeshwar B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11922-11932Google Scholar, 29Patel S. Turner P.R. Stubberfield C. Barry E. Rohlff C.R. Stamps A. Tyson K. Terrett J. Box G. Eccles S. Page M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 416-424Google Scholar, 30Beech D.J. Madan A.K. Deng N. J. Surg. Res. 2002; 103: 203-207Google Scholar). Also, plasma HYAL1 is capable of promoting tumor cell cycling (31Lin G. Stern R. Cancer Lett. 2001; 163: 95-101Google Scholar). PH-20 enhances cell proliferation (4Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that PH-20 increased cell cycle progression in L929 cells. PH-20-activated JNK1 is essential for cell survival, since dominant negative JNK1 mediated apoptosis in L929 cells. UV light up-regulates and activates p53 (32Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Google Scholar) and also activates JNK1 (12Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of the anisomycin-treated cells with anti-p53 resulted in the presence of p53, JNK1, and WOX1 in the precipitate. The observation suggests the presence of a p53·WOX1·JNK1 complex during stress response. Most recently, we determined that a portion of cytosolic IκBα binds p53 in resting cells and the complex dissociates in response to apoptotic stress, hypoxia, DNA damage, and tumor growth factor-β1-mediated growth suppression (20Chang N.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10323-10331Google Scholar). The dissociation allows p53 nuclear translocation. Alternatively, when dissociated from IκBα, p53 may complex with WOX1 and JNK1. Although transient JNK1 activation provides a signal for cell survival (13MacCorkle-Chosnek R.A. VanHooser A. Goodrich D.W. Brinkley B.R. Tan T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 173-180Google Scholar, 16Roulston A. Reinhard C. Amiri P. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Google Scholar, 17Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Thyroid. 2001; 11: 629-636Google Scholar, 19Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 278-286Google Scholar), a persistent JNK1 activation can mediate cell death (14Harris C.A. Deshmukh M. Tsui-Pierchala B. Maroney A.C. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 103-113Google Scholar,15Kobayashi K. Tsukamoto I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1537: 79-88Google Scholar). How the antiapoptotic JNK1 turns into apoptotic is not known. It may be related to the status of JNK1 phosphorylation, or it may be associated with JNK1-regulated gene expression at different stages of cell differentiation or stress. We believe that at a certain stage of apoptosis, the apoptotic JNK1 may act synergistically with WOX1 in facilitating cell death. In transient expression, both wild type JNK2 and JNK3 mediated L929 cell death, yet the dominant negatives greatly increased the cell death. The likely explanation is that the kinetics of activation of JNK isoforms is different, and their functional roles may be different also. For example, JNK1 and JNK2 have distinct roles in antiviral immunity, in which JNK1 is involved in survival of activated T cells during immune responses, and JNK2 plays a role in control of CD8(+) T cell expansion in vivo (33Arbour N. Naniche D. Homann D. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Oldstone M.B. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 801-810Google Scholar). Similarly, JNK1 and JNK2 play distinct roles in controlling the activation of CD8(+) T cells (34Conze D. Krahl T. Kennedy N. Weiss L. Lumsden J. Hess P. Flavell R.A. Le Gros G. Davis R.J. Rincon M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 811-823Google Scholar). Also, JNK1-deficient cells resist UV-mediated apoptosis, whereas JNK2-deficient cells have increased sensitivity to UV irradiation (35Hochedlinger K. Wagner E.F. Sabapathy K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2441-2445Google Scholar). JNKs are widely distributed in the nervous system (12Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar), and JNK3 is involved not only in neuronal development but also apoptosis of neuronal cells (36Waetzig V. Herdegen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 567-572Google Scholar). L929 cells express both JNK1 and JNK2 (17Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 107-112Google Scholar, 19Chang N.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 278-286Google Scholar). Whether JNK3 is expressed in L929 cells is unknown. Dominant negative JNK1 mediated L929 cell apoptosis, suggesting that JNK1 is essential for the survival of these cells. Inhibition of JNK2 and JNK3 functions by dominant negatives induced cell death, suggesting that L929 cells also require a certain level of JNK2 and JNK3 for survival. In contrast to the wild type JNK1, transiently expressed wild type JNK2 and JNK3 induced L929 cell death, indicating that the kinetics of activation of JNK isoforms is different. Taken together, phosphorylation of Tyr33 and probably Tyr61 is important for activating WOX1. Our data support the possibility that WOX1 is a signaling protein in the p53 and JNK1 stress pathways. Whether activated JNK1 phosphorylates WOX1 remains to be determined. We thank Terri Zimmer for antibody production in rabbits, John Heath and Lori Schultz for technical assistance, and Drs. Roger Davis and Michael Kracht for JNK constructs."

Depending on the developmental stage and cell type TGF-βs regulate diverse processes including development, cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B.

Members of the TGF-β superfamily can be subdivided into subfamilies of structurally closer related proteins, including the TGF-βs 1–3, bone morphogenetic proteins, the growth/differentiation factors (GDFs), activins, and the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family (5McDonald N.Q.

The protein does not belong to one of the known TGF-β subfamilies and represents a divergent member of the TGF-β superfamily. GDF-15 is widely synthesized in the central nervous system, most strongly expressed in the choroid plexus, and secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid, from where it may penetrate into the brain parenchyma (14Bottner M. Suter-Crazzolara C. Schober A. Unsicker K. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 297: 103-110Google Scholar, 15Strelau J. Sullivan A. Bottner M. Lingor P. Falkenstein E. Suter- Crazzolara C. Galter D. Jaszai J.

We have previously shown survival promoting effects of GDF-15 on unlesioned and intoxicated midbrain dopaminergic neurons in vitro and in vivo (15Strelau J. Sullivan A. Bottner M. Lingor P.

Serotonergic neurons of the embryonic rat raphe were one additional neuron population that responded to GDF-15 by an increase in transmitter synthesis and uptake. However, motoneurons of the spinal cord and sensory dorsal root ganglionic neurons did not respond at all or only very moderately to GDF-15. At this point, it is not clear whether other types of central nervous system neurons are affected by GDF-15. In a previous study, we had also shown that GDF-15 protein is up-regulated in cortical neurons subsequent to a cold lesion (16Schober A. Bottner M. Strelau J. Kinscherf R. Bonaterra G.A. Barth M. Schilling L. Fairlie W.D. Breit S.N. Unsicker K. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 439: 32-45Google Scholar). This may indicate functions of the protein in neurons affected by injury and suggest a role of GDF-15 in the execution of either survival or cell death programs.Cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) from postnatal rat represent a highly homogeneous neuron population that provides an excellent system to study neuronal apoptosis. CGN survive for weeks in vitro and develop characteristics of mature CGN in vivowhen maintained in depolarizing concentrations of K+ (25 mm), but undergo apoptosis when cultured in physiological low K+ (5 mm) conditions (17Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Google Scholar, 18D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Google Scholar, 19Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Google Scholar). Although mechanisms underlying CGN apoptosis are not clear as yet, a requirement of RNA/protein synthesis, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of caspases, and phosphorylation of c-Jun have been implicated in this apoptotic model (18D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Google Scholar, 20Schulz J.B. Weller M. Klockgether T. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4696-4706Google Scholar, 21Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D. Kyriakis J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Google Scholar).Our previous observation that GDF-15 is specifically up-regulated in lesioned neurons prompted us to investigate pro- or anti-apoptotic effects of GDF-15 and underlying mechanisms in CGN. Here we demonstrate that (i) GDF-15 prevents death of CGN in low K+ by activating Akt and down-regulating ERK, (ii) low K+-induced ERK activation, in turn, induces c-Jun, which can be inhibited by GDF-15, and (iii) GDF-15 mediated survival is accompanied by prevention of low K+-induced ROS generation in CGN.DISCUSSIONGDF-15 is a novel divergent member of the TGF-β superfamily with largely unknown functions. Recent studies demonstrated that the molecule is expressed in the central nervous system, and the first functional characterization of the factor revealed pronounced neurotrophic effects on midbrain dopaminergic and raphe serotonergic neurons in vitro and in vivo (15Strelau J. Sullivan A. Bottner M. Lingor P. Falkenstein E. Suter- Crazzolara C. Galter D. Jaszai J. Krieglstein K. Unsicker K. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8597-8603Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether other central nervous system neuron populations are also promoted by GDF-15. TGF-βs can affect neurons in both anti- and pro-apoptotic fashions. Thus, elimination of TGF-β in chick embryos has been shown to abolish ontogenetic neuron death (36Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Google Scholar,42Krieglstein K. Richter S. Farkas L. Schuster N. Dunker N. Oppenheim R.W. Unsicker K. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1085-1090Google Scholar) acting as a master molecule in the regulation of pro-apoptotic signaling cascades. In contrast, TGF-β can also synergize with neurotrophic factors, e.g. neurotrophins, fibroblast growth factor-2, and GDNF, in the promotion of neuron survival (43Chalazonitis A. Kalberg J. Twardzik D.R. Morrison R.S. Kessler J.A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 152: 121-132Google Scholar, 44Marzella P.L. Clark G.M. Shepherd R.K. Bartlett P.F. Kilpatrick T.J. Neurosci.

Unsicker K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9822-9834Google Scholar, 47Peterziel H. Unsicker K. Krieglstein K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 157-167Google Scholar). With regard to GDF-15, a pro-apoptotic role in several cell lines has been suggested (48Li P.X. Wong J. Ayed A. Ngo D. Brade A.M. Arrowsmith C. Austin R.C. Klamut H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20127-20135Google Scholar, 49Tan M. Wang Y. Guan K. Sun Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 109-114Google Scholar, 50Baek S.J. Kim K.S. Nixon J.B. Wilson L.C. Eling T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 901-908Google Scholar, 51Graichen R. Liu D. Sun Y. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26662-26672Google Scholar). Moreover, our observation that GDF-15 is robustly induced in lesioned cortical neurons (16Schober A. Bottner M. Strelau J. Kinscherf R. Bonaterra G.A. Barth M. Schilling L. Fairlie W.D. Breit S.N. Unsicker K. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 439: 32-45Google Scholar) can be interpreted in terms of both an anti- or pro-apoptotic role. To clarify this, we started to analyze the effect of GDF-15 and underlying mechanisms on neuronal apoptosis using the well established CGN model (18D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that cultured granule neurons express GDF-15, but expression is down-regulated upon withdrawal of survival promoting signals (not shown). The present study demonstrates that GDF-15, in contrast to TGF-β2, which has been shown to accelerate apoptosis in CGN (52de Luca A. Weller M. Fontana A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4174-4185Google Scholar), prevents primary CGN from low K+-induced apoptosis. Concerning underlying mechanisms, we first showed that the protective effect of GDF-15 was attenuated by inhibitors of the Akt-activating PI3K. Western blot analyses clearly confirmed the functional results and demonstrated a GDF-15-dependent activation of Akt and its downstream target GSK-3β. Consistent with our data is the observation that other TGF-β members, including GDNF, neurturin, persephin, and TGF-β1, promote cell survival via the PI3K/Akt pathway in various cell types (53Manabe Y. Nagano I. Gazi M.S. Murakami T. Shiote M. Shoji M. Kitagawa H. Setoguchi Y. Abe K. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 329-334Google Scholar, 54Encinas M. Tansey M.G. Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Comella J.X. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1464-1472Google Scholar, 55Trupp M. Scott R. Whittemore S.R. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20885-20894Google Scholar, 56Shin I. Bakin A.V. Rodeck U. Brunet A. Arteaga C.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3328-3339Google Scholar, 57Vinals F. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7218-7230Google Scholar).We next analyzed whether the MEK/ERK pathway may be involved in GDF-15 dependent neuron rescue. Surprisingly, we found that GDF-15-induced protection in CGN was even more pronounced when ERKs were inactivated via selective inhibition of MEK. Moreover, MEK inactivation alone led to a potent protection against low K+-induced apoptosis of CGN. We observed slow and sustained ERK activation in CGN undergoing low K+-induced cell death. Down-regulation of ERK by MEK inhibitors led to a prevention of low K+-induced apoptosis. These findings corroborate several recent reports showing a pro-apoptotic involvement of ERK in neuronal cell death (58Murray B. Alessandrini A. Cole A.J. Yee A.G. Furshpan E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11975-11980Google Scholar, 59Stanciu M. Wang Y. Kentor R. Burke N. Watkins S. Kress G. Reynolds I. Klann E. Angiolieri M.R. Johnson J.W. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12200-12206Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies also demonstrate thatl-2-chloropropionate- and kainate-mediated cell death in CGN (60Myhre O. Bjugan B. Fonnum F. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 992-997Google Scholar, 61Giardina S.F. Beart P.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 1733-1742Google Scholar) is attenuated by MEK inhibition. Most importantly, GDF-15 clearly suppressed the persistent ERK activity in CGN. Prevention of cell death by MEK inhibitors is unexpected, because typically the ERK pathway has been credited with proliferative and cell survival responses (62Anderson P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 33-46Google Scholar, 63Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Google Scholar). However, our results together with the above studies expand the functional role of ERKs and suggest that the duration of ERK activation might determine pro- or anti-apoptotic decision of the cell.The AP-1 transcription factor family members c-fosand c-jun have been implicated with pro-apoptotic functions (see Ref. 64Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Google Scholar for a review). The role of c-Fos in low K+-induced CGN cell death is not known. A requirement of c-Jun activation in mediating low K+-induced CGN apoptosis has previously been demonstrated by Watson et al. (21Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D. Kyriakis J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Google Scholar). The present study has provided evidence that c-Jun phosphorylation and protein levels increase in parallel to the increase in ERK activation. Notably, MEK1/2 inhibition or treatment with GDF-15, which both inhibit ERK activation, also inhibited c-Jun protein up-regulation and phosphorylation. Although the in vivo role of ERK in regulating c-Jun has yet to be determined (65Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Google Scholar), evidence that c-Jun can be phosphorylated by ERK in vitro (34Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Google Scholar) and our finding that MEK1/2 inhibition attenuates the increase in c-Jun protein and phosphorylation argue in favor of the possibility that ERK may be directly involved in regulating c-jun in low K+CGN culture. It is also worthwhile noting that the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 was originally characterized based on its ability to inhibit AP-1 transcription elements c-jun and c-fos via the inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling cascade (29Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Google Scholar). Furthermore, the demonstration that kainate-induced toxicity involves c-Jun activation (66Cheung N.S. Carroll F.Y. Larm J.A. Beart P.M. Giardina S.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 69-82Google Scholar), as well as the ability of MEK inhibitors to prevent kainate toxicity in CGN (61Giardina S.F. Beart P.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 1733-1742Google Scholar), may further strengthen the possible role of ERK activation in modulating c-Jun activity. GDF-15-induced inhibition of c-Jun indicates that the factor prevents cell death by down-regulating a key signal in the mediation of cell death.Whether GDF-15-mediated inhibition of c-Jun transmits to other important regulators of cell death remains open. Possible target molecules with roles in cell cycle control and apoptosis are cell cycle-regulated protein kinases (67Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated a MEK/ERK-mediated regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin kinase inhibitors p21 and p27. Activation of CDKs and cyclin kinase inhibitors can result in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (68Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Google Scholar, 69Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Google Scholar, 70Tang D. Wu D. Hirao A. Lahti J.M. Liu L. Mazza B. Kidd V.J. Mak T.W. Ingram A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12710-12717Google Scholar). In the nervous system CDKs have been shown to be involved in the death of PC12 cells and postmitotic neurons (71Park D.S. Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8161-8169Google Scholar, 72Park D.S. Levine B. Ferrari G. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8975-8983Google Scholar, 73Osuga H. Osuga S. Wang F. Fetni R. Hogan M.J. Slack R.S.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1401-1410Google Scholar). For example, serum-deprived neuronal PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons deprived of trophic support contain inappropriate amounts of cyclin B and cyclin D transcripts prior to death (75Freeman R.S. Estus S. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 343-355Google Scholar, 76Gao C.Y. Zelenka P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 612-618Google Scholar). Most importantly, Padmanabhan et al. (77Padmanabhan J. Park D.S. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8747-8756Google Scholar) documented the requirement of CDK proteins in low K+-induced CGN cell death. They demonstrated an up-regulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E after 6 h in low K+. This is consistent with the late and persistent ERK induction observed in our studies. Although the mechanisms underlying CDK-activated neuronal cell death are still unknown, non-neuronal cells have provided model systems for the control of cell death via the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. The ability of MEK inhibitors to regulate CDKs and cyclin kinase inhibitor proteins (70Tang D. Wu D. Hirao A. Lahti J.M. Liu L. Mazza B. Kidd V.J. Mak T.W. Ingram A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12710-12717Google Scholar, 78Hoshino R. Tanimura S. Watanabe K. Kataoka T. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2686-2692Google Scholar, 79Lents N.H. Keenan S.M. Bellone C. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47469-47475Google Scholar), the presence of a consensus AP-1 promoter sequence in cyclin D1, and its direct induction by c-Jun (67Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Google Scholar) suggest that the strong MEK/ERK/c-Jun signals observed in this study may direct the regulation of cell cycle protein kinases for the orchestration of neuronal cell death.To elucidate the GDF-15-mediated mechanisms that suppress ERK activation in CGN, we continued by documenting that the protective effect of GDF-15 is connected to the regulation of ROS. It has been reported that increased generation of ROS is closely associated with low K+-induced cell death (20Schulz J.B. Weller M. Klockgether T. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4696-4706Google Scholar, 39Valencia A. Moran J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 284-297Google Scholar), and several studies have provided evidence that ROS induces ERK activation (80Rao G.N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 713-719Google Scholar, 81Chen W. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Google Scholar, 82Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Google Scholar). We now show for the first time that GDF-15 inhibits the formation of ROS. Furthermore, the inability of both MEK inhibitors to prevent ROS generation suggests that ROS generation is upstream of ERK activation in low K+ CGN. It should be noted, however, that in other systems, as superior cervical ganglionic neurons, nerve growth factor can prevent ROS generation by activating the ERK pathway (83Dugan L.L. Creedon D.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Holtzman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4086-4091Google Scholar), suggesting that ROS formation in this system is downstream of ERK.The present in vitro work has provided clues for the possible signaling pathways that are activated by GDF-15 for executing its functions. Activation of Akt is known to play a critical role in controlling the balance between survival and apoptosis (84Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Google Scholar, 85Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Google Scholar). The discovery that ERK inhibition promotes survival was surprising but needs to be discussed in the context of the putative in vivorelevance of this finding. Recent in vivo studies have revealed that inhibition of ERK can reduce infarct volume after focal cerebral ischemia, suggesting a deleterious effect of ERK activation (86Alessandrini A. Namura S. Moskowitz M.A. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12866-12869Google Scholar, 87Namura S. Iihara K. Takami S. Nagata I. Kikuchi H. Matsushita K. Moskowitz M.A. Bonventre J.V. Alessandrini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11569-11574Google Scholar). In addition, an abnormal punctate staining pattern of activated ERK has been described in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (88Perry G. Roder H. Nunomura A. Takeda A. Friedlich A.L. Zhu X. Raina A.K. Holbrook N. Siedlak S.L. Harris P.L. Smith M.A. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2411-2415Google Scholar). While the status of ERK activation in patients with Parkinson's disease is currently unknown, the involvement of ERK in 6-hydroxydopamine toxicity (89Kulich S.M. Chu C.T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1058-1066Google Scholar), and our previous in vivo studies, in which we demonstrated potent protective effects of GDF-15 in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat brains (15Strelau J. Sullivan A. Bottner M. Lingor P. Falkenstein E. Suter- Crazzolara C. Galter D. Jaszai J. Krieglstein K. Unsicker K. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8597-8603Google Scholar), suggest that the GDF-15 may exert its protective effect in neurons through an ERK-inactivating mechanism.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that GDF-15 prevents cell death in low K+ CGN cultures by two different modes of action. First, GDF-15 induces survival by activating Akt and GSK via the PI3K. Second, GDF-15 down-regulates the MEK/ERK/c-Jun cell death signaling pathway. Moreover, GDF-15 also attenuates ROS formation, an inducer of ERK, thereby preventing cell death. Putative cross-talks between these pathways need to be addressed by future experiments. An important issue also to be resolved in the future concerns the identity of GDF-15 receptors. Finally, the question whether GDF-15 may act as a regulator of apoptosis for CGN in vivo remains to be answered. Ongoing studies with a GDF-15-deficient lacZ knock-in transgenic mouse, recently developed in our laboratory, may help to address this question.

Depending on the developmental stage and cell type TGF-βs regulate diverse processes including development, cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B.

Members of the TGF-β superfamily can be subdivided into subfamilies of structurally closer related proteins, including the TGF-βs 1–3, bone morphogenetic proteins, the growth/differentiation factors (GDFs), activins, and the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family (5McDonald N.Q.

Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2227-2240Google Scholar). All TGF-β famliy members, except members of the GDNF subfamily, signal through heteromeric complexes of type I and type II serine/threonine kinases receptors. Within the type I and type II receptor families there are several subgroups, e.g. bone morphogenetic protein receptors, depending on their respective ligands (f"

Ultraviolet light and deficiency of the p16ink4a gene are known factors that predispose one to the development of malignant melanoma. The signal transduction pathways that underlie the progression of melanoma from their precursors, atypical nevi, are not well understood. We examined activation of the MAP kinase pathway in atypical nevi and melanoma cells and found that this pathway is activated in melanomas. To determine the functional significance of this activation, we introduced constitutively active MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) into immortalized melanocytes. The introduction of this gene into melanocytes leads to tumorigenesis in nude mice, activation of the angiogenic switch, and increased production of the proangiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Activation of MAP kinase signaling may be an important pathway involved in melanoma transformation. Inhibition of MAP kinase signaling may be useful in the prevention and treatment of melanoma.

Activation of MAP kinase signaling may be an important pathway involved in melanoma transformation. Inhibition of MAP kinase signaling may be useful in the prevention and treatment of melanoma. Malignant melanoma is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Melanomas often arise from precursor lesions called atypical nevi (1Kamb A. Gruis N.A. Weaver-Feldhaus J. Liu Q. Harshman K. Tavtigian S.V. Stockert E. Day III, R.S. Johnson B.E. Skolnick M.H. Science. 1994; 264: 436-440Google Scholar). Although the prognosis of thin melanoma is excellent, prognosis decreases with increased thickness of the lesions. The diminished prognosis is due mainly to the well established tendency of melanoma to metastasize. In addition, melanomas are highly resistant to most forms of chemotherapy and radiation; therefore, cure of the disseminated disease is uncommon. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the signal transduction pathways underlying transformation of melanocytes to melanoma. Several histologic and immunohistochemical markers have been shown to correlate with prognosis. The first and still most widely used markers of melanoma prognosis are Breslow thickness and Clark's levels (2Clark Jr., W.H. From L. Bernardino E.A. Mihm M.C. Cancer Res. 1969; 29: 705-727Google Scholar, 3Sober A.J. Fitzpatrick T.B. Mihm M.C. Wise T.G. Pearson B.J. Clark W.H. Kopf A.W. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1979; 242: 2795-2799Google Scholar). Breslow thickness measures the width of the lesion, and lesions >0.75 mm have a distinctly worse prognosis than thinner melanomas. Clark's levels measure the depth of invasion of the melanoma from the dermoepidermal junction to deeper layers of the dermis and subcutaneous fat. Both of these markers are measures of the ability of melanoma cells to grow three dimensionally (4Klafter R. Arbiser J.L. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp.

More recently, other genes have been shown to be expressed or repressed in different stages of melanoma progression (6Tsao H. Benoit E. Sober A.J. Thiele C. Haluska F.G.

Various integrins have been shown to be expressed in advanced melanomas and correlate with decreased apoptosis and invasion (10Hsu M.Y. Shih D.T. Meier F.E. Van Belle P. Hsu J.Y. Elder D.E. Buck C.A.

Finally, expression of the small G protein rhoC is associated with increased metastatic ability of melanoma (12Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O.

However, the signal transduction pathways associated with melanoma transformation are not well understood. We have previously noted that an inverse correlation exists between the expression of activated MAP kinase and the degree of malignancy in tumors derived from endothelium (4Klafter R. Arbiser J.L. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 2000; 5: 79-82Google Scholar, 14Arbiser J.L. Moses M.A. Fernandez C.A. Ghiso N. Cao Y. Klauber N. Frank D. Brownlee M. Flynn E. Parangi S. Byers H.R. Folkman J. Proc.

Other investigators have demonstrated a direct correlation between MAP kinase expression and the degree of malignancy in other tumors (15Mandell J.W. Hussaini I.M. Zecevic M. Weber M.J. VandenBerg S.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1411-1423Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the role of MAP kinase in malignancy may be tissue specific. We examined the expression of activated MAP kinase in human nevi and melanomas and found increasing expression in malignant cells, particularly in early (radial growth) melanoma (16Cohen C. Zavala-Pompa A. Sequeira J.H. Shoji M. Sexton D.G. Cotsonis G. Cerimele F. Govindarajan B. Macaron N. Arbiser J.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 3728-3733Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrate that MAP kinase activation functionally contributes to the development of melanoma, as the introduction of a constitutively active MAPKK into melanocytes leads to transformation in vivo. The activation of MAP kinase results in the activation of AP-1 but not the activation of NFκB. Inhibition of MAP kinase signaling (17Koo H.M. VanBrocklin M. McWilliams M.J. Leppla S.H. Duesbery N.S. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; Google Scholar) may provide a therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of melanoma. Paraffin-fixed sections of nevi and melanomas were stained with an antibody specific for phosphorylated MAP kinase according to the procedure of Arbiser et al.(18Arbiser J.L. Weiss S.W. Arbiser Z.K.

L10BIOBR cells are an immortalized murine melanocyte cell line that proliferates best in the presence of exogenous phorbol ester (G. P. Dotto, Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA) (19Cajal S. Suster S. Halaban R. Filvaroff E. Dotto G.P. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 349-358Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in F-10 nutrient mixture (Ham's medium) with 7% horse serum. L10BIOBR cells were infected with retroviruses encoding green fluorescent protein (pDIVA-GFP) (A. Kowalczyk, Emory University) or a constitutively active MAPKK mutant, LIDA/MANA (C. Marshall, Institute of Cancer Research, London). Both vectors encode puromycin resistance, and cells were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin and pooled (20Dotto G.P. Moellmann G. Ghosh S. Edwards M. Halaban R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3115-3128Google Scholar). GFP expression was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, and expression of the active MAP kinase kinase gene was confirmed by performing Western blot analysis with an antibody specific to phosphorylated MAP kinase. Protein extracts were prepared as described by Arbiser and co-workers (21LaMontagne Jr., K.R. Moses M.A. Wiederschain D. Mahajan S. Holden J. Ghazizadeh H. Frank D.A. Arbiser J.L. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1937-1945Google Scholar). Expression of the constitutively active MAPKK was confirmed using antibody 177 to rabbit MAPKK (C. Marshall, London). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 1 mmNa3VO4. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were treated with Laemmli sample buffer and heated to 90 °C for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 and subsequently incubated with the appropriate antibody for immunoblotting. The anti-Erk2 monoclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-phospho-MAPK, phospho-c-Jun (Ser73), phospho S6 ribosomal protein (Ser235-Ser236), phospho S6 ribosomal protein (Ser240-Ser244), and phospho p70 S6 kinase (Thr421-Ser424) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Cells were grown to ∼75% confluence in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the medium was replaced with Cellgro serum-free medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). Substrate gel electrophoresis (zymography) was conducted as described by us previously (14Arbiser J.L. Moses M.A. Fernandez C.A. Ghiso N. Cao Y. Klauber N. Frank D. Brownlee M. Flynn E. Parangi S. Byers H.R. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 861-866Google Scholar). Briefly, Type 1 gelatin was added at a concentration of 1 mg/ml to the standard Laemmli acrylamide polymerization mixture (22Herron G.S. Banda M.J. Clark E.J. Gavrilovic J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2814-2818Google Scholar). Conditioned media from equivalent numbers of cells were diluted 3:1 with sample buffer (10% SDS, 4% sucrose, 0.25 m Tris, pH 6.8, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed as described previously. At the end of electrophoresis, gels were rinsed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min and then incubated overnight in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.02% NaN3). The gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue R-250 in acetic acid/isopropyl alcohol/H20 (1:3:6) and destained in the same buffer in which the Coomassie Blue was prepared. The densitometry of destained areas was quantified using a Datascopy GS Plus scanner connected to Macintosh II computer with Macimage software (Xerox Imaging Systems). TIMP bioactivity was quantified using conditioned media from equal numbers of L10BIOBR cells expressing active MAPKK or GFP vector control. A solid collagen film assay was performed using C14-labeled collagen as described by us previously (14Arbiser J.L. Moses M.A. Fernandez C.A. Ghiso N. Cao Y. Klauber N. Frank D. Brownlee M. Flynn E. Parangi S. Byers H.R. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 861-866Google Scholar). One million cells were injected subcutaneously into 4–5 week old male nude mice (Charles River) in the presence of a small quantity of trypan blue to mark the inoculation site. Tumors were excised after one month, fixed in formalin, and subjected to histologic and in situ hybridization. Tumor volume was calculated according to the formula (w2 × l)0.52, where w represents the shortest dimension (14Arbiser J.L. Moses M.A. Fernandez C.A. Ghiso N. Cao Y. Klauber N. Frank D. Brownlee M. Flynn E. Parangi S. Byers H.R. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 861-866Google Scholar). In situhybridization was performed on 4 mm-thick sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Details of in situ hybridization have been reported previously (18Arbiser J.L. Weiss S.W.

RT-PCR was done with Promega Accession RT-PCR kit. Primers used were as follows: actin (728 bp), forward 5′-AAG ATG ACC CAG ATC ATG TTT GAG AC-3′ and reverse 5′-CTG CTT GCT GAT CCA CAT CTG CTG G-3′; VEGF(445 bp), forward 5′-TCA TGC GGA TCA AAC CTC ACC AA-3′ and reverse 5′-TCT CGC CCT CCG GAC CCA AAG T-3′. Reactions were performed in an Eppendorf master cycler. One PCR cycle at 45 Co for 45 min and 94 Co for 2 min followed by forty PCR cycles under standard conditions with an annealing temperature of 60 °C were performed. β-actin mRNA was used as a reference message to normalize the content of total RNA. VEGF expression was calculated as the relative expression ratio to that of β-actin. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. Quantification was determined by triplicate repeats (26Bonino F. Milanini J. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 1254-1260Google Scholar). Curcumin used for AP-1 inhibition studies was obtained from Sigma and prepared as a stock solution in Me2SO at 10 mg/ml. The protein array was accomplished to compare the transcription factors involved in L10BIOBRMAPKK and L10BIOBRGFP cells. Nuclear extract was isolated from these cells using the Panomics nuclear extraction kit (catalog number AY2002), and the array was performed using TranSignal™ protein/DNA arrays. In brief, DNA/protein hybridization was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gel area was excised containing the protein/DNA complex, and the protein/DNA complex was extracted using the extraction buffer and finally incubated with 6 μl of gel extraction beads at room temperature for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 s to pellet out the beads. The beads were washed, and the supernatant was removed. The bound probes were eluted by resuspending the pellet in 50 μl of dH2O and incubated at room temperature for 10 min with vortexing for two to three times during incubation. Detection was done after the addition of 20 ml of 1× blocking buffer to each membrane and incubation at room temperature for 15 min with gentle shaking. 20 μl of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was added directly to 20 ml of 1× blocking buffer, and continued shaking at room temperature was conducted for 15 min. Each membrane was washed three times at room temperature with 20 ml of 1× wash buffer each 8 min followed by the exposure of 20 ml of 1× detection buffer to each membrane and incubation at room temperature for 5 min. 2 ml of a substrate working solution containing equal volumes of the luminol enhancer and peroxide solution was added, and the membranes were incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then exposed using Kodak BioMax film. To determine whether phosphorylated (active) MAP kinase is activated in malignant melanoma, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of both benign melanocytic nevi and malignant melanoma according to the method of Arbiser et al. (18Arbiser J.L. Weiss S.W. Arbiser Z.K. Bravo F. Govindajaran B. Caceres-Rios H. Cotsonis G. Recavarren S. Swerlick R.A. Cohen C. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2001; 44: 1-5Google Scholar).

Very little staining was observed in benign melanocytic nevi, but prominent nuclear staining was observed in human melanoma tumors (Fig.1)."
https://openalex.org/W2123588949,"The protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (PPI-1) inhibits phosphatase type-1 (PP1) only when phosphorylated by protein kinase A and could play a pivotal role in the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation balance. Rat cardiac PPI-1 was cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, expressed in Eschericia coli, evaluated in phosphatase assays, and used to generate an antiserum. An adenovirus was constructed encoding PPI-1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) under separate cytomegalovirus promotors (AdPPI-1/GFP). A GFP-only virus (AdGFP) served as control. Engineered heart tissue (EHT) from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and adult rat cardiac myocytes (ARCMs) were used as model systems. PPI-1 expression was determined in human ventricular samples by Northern blots. Compared with AdGFP, AdPPI-1/GFP-infected neonatal rat cardiomyocytes displayed a 73% reduction in PP1 activity. EHTs infected with AdPPI-1/GFP exhibited a fivefold increase in isoprenaline sensitivity. AdPPI-1/GFP-infected ARCMs displayed enhanced cell shortening as well as enhanced phospholamban phosphorylation when stimulated with 1 nM isoprenaline. PPI-1 mRNA levels were reduced by 57+/-12% in failing hearts with dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy (n=8 each) compared with nonfailing hearts (n=8). In summary, increased PPI-1 expression enhances myocyte sensitivity to isoprenaline, indicating that PPI-1 acts as an amplifier in beta-adrenergic signaling. Decreased PPI-1 in failing human hearts could participate in desensitization of the cAMP pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2131098432,"Here we analyze the role of the angiotensinergic system in the differentiation of dendritic cells (DC). We found that human monocytes produce angiotensin II (AII) and express AT1 and AT2 receptors for AII. DC differentiated from human monocytes in the presence of AT1 receptor antagonists losartan or candesartan show very low levels of CD1a expression and poor endocytic and allostimulatory activities. By contrast, DC differentiation in the presence of either the AT2 receptor antagonist PD 123319 or exogenous AII results in the development of nonadherent cells with CD1a expression and endocytic and allostimulatory activities higher than control DC. Similar contrasting effects were observed in mouse DC obtained from bone marrow cultures supplemented with granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor. DC differentiated in the presence of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan express lower levels of CD11c, CD40, and Ia and display a lower ability to endocyte horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and to induce antibody responses in vivo, compared with controls. By contrast, DC differentiation in the presence of either the AT2 receptor antagonist PD 123319 or exogenous AII results in cells with high levels of CD11c, CD40, and Ia, as well as high ability to endocyte HRP and to induce antibody responses in vivo. Our results support the notion that the differentiation of DC is regulated by AII."
https://openalex.org/W1994886233,"Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) is the main adhesion-induced kinase in bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Previous studies have shown that ligation of αvβ3integrin in osteoclasts induces c-Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and PYK2 activation, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement, migration, and polarization of these cells. In this study, we examined the role of PYK2 kinase activity and its major autophosphorylation site in adhesion-dependent signaling and cytoskeletal organization during osteoclast spreading and migration. By infecting pre-fusion osteoclasts using recombinant adenovirus expressing PYK2 and its mutants, we demonstrated that mutation at the autophosphorylation site (Y402F) abolishes PYK2 association with c-Src and reduces significantly phosphorylation at tyrosines 579/580 and 881 resulting in inhibition of osteoclast spreading and bone resorption. Overexpression of the kinase-dead PYK2(K475A) mutant had no effect on cell spreading, interaction with c-Src, or the phosphorylation level of Tyr-402, Tyr-579/580, and Tyr-881 relative to PYK2(wt)-expressing cells. Taken together these findings suggest that Tyr-402 is the major docking site for c-Src and can be phosphorylated by another tyrosine kinase in osteoclasts but not in HEK293 cells. Interestingly, both PYK2(Y402F) and PYK2(K457A) translocate normally to podosomes and have no effect on macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced osteoclast migration. Whereas PYK2(Y402F) dominant negatively blocks osteoclast spreading and bone resorption, PYK2(K457A) may function in part as an adaptor by initially recruiting c-Src to the adhesion complex, which appears to activate PYK2 by phosphorylating additional tyrosines in its regulatory and C-terminal domains. We thus concluded that phosphorylation at Tyr-402 in PYK2 is essential in the regulation of adhesion-dependent cytoskeletal organization in osteoclasts.

Adhesion to bone matrix induces osteoclast differentiation, cytoskeletal reorganization, and cellular polarization, leading to formation of unique membrane areas for active bone resorption. These include the following: (i) the sealing zone, for tight adhesion to bone matrix; (ii) the ruffled border, for directional secretion of protons and proteases into the resorption lacuna; and (iii) functional secretory domain toward bone marrow space, for transcytosis and release of degraded bone matrix (1Suda T.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2835-2844Google Scholar). We reported previously (16Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Google Scholar, 19Duong L.T. Nakamura I. Lakkakorpi P.T. Lipfert L. Bett A.J. Rodan G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7484-7492Google Scholar) that PYK2 localizes to podosomes as well as to sealing zone in bone-resorbing osteoclasts, and cells treated with antisense PYK2 are not able to resorb bone in vitro. Furthermore, engagement of αvβ3integrin by ligands or antibodies in osteoclasts leads to PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in a c-Src-dependent manner (16Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Google Scholar). The role of PYK2 phosphorylation and the activity to carry these functions have not been fully defined. Similar to the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), PYK2 lacks SH2 and SH3 domains but contains other functional domains, including two proline-rich regions in its C terminus and several phosphorylated tyrosine residues, which can mediate specific protein-protein interactions (23Avraham H. Park S.-Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Google Scholar). Tyrosine 402 in PYK2, analogous to tyrosine 397 in FAK, has been suggested as the primary autophosphorylation site that provides a docking site for the SH2 domain of c-Src (23Avraham H. Park S.-Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Google Scholar, 24Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Google Scholar, 25Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Google Scholar). Association of PYK2 with c-Src leads to further phosphorylation of PYK2 at tyrosines 579 and 580 in the kinase domain activation loop, assumed to be required for its maximal catalytic activity, and at tyrosine 881 at the C terminus, which mediates the association of PYK2 with Grb2 (25Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Google Scholar). In addition, proline-rich regions in the PYK2 C terminus mediate interactions with yet other adaptor molecules, p130Cas and Graf (17Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Nagy R.M. Parsons J.T. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4900-4907Google Scholar, 23Avraham H. Park S.-Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to examine if PYK2 kinase activity and its ability to associate with c-Src are essential for mediating osteoclastic cytoskeletal organization. We examined the effects of overexpression of PYK2 kinase-dead (K457A) mutant and of an autophosphorylation site (Y402F) mutant on the adhesion-mediated signaling, cell spreading, and migration. We found that Tyr-402 phosphorylation, but not its kinase activity, is important for osteoclast spreading and adhesion-induced association of PYK2 with c-Src. Furthermore, expression of PYK2(Y402F) in osteoclasts prevented normal bone resorption. Whereas both PYK2(Y402F) and PYK2(K457A) translocate to podosomes, PYK2(Y402F) acts in a dominant negative fashion to inhibit adhesion-dependent signaling in osteoclasts by blocking binding to c-Src and phosphorylation of additional tyrosines in the regulatory and C-terminal domains of PYK2. On the other hand, we observe normal phosphorylation of the kinase-defective PYK2(K457A) at Tyr-402, followed by Src recruitment. We thus suggest here that PYK2 functions as an adaptor for c-Src which allows full activation of PYK2 and other signaling molecules in the adhesion complexes during osteoclastic cytoskeletal organization.

Phosphorylation site-specific polyclonal antibodies for PYK2 were from BIOSOURCEInternational (Camarillo, CA). Anti-PYK2 polyclonal antibodies were as described previously (16Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Google Scholar). Anti-pp60c-Src (mAb GD11) and anti-phosphotyrosine (mAb 4G10) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies to paxillin were from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), and anti-HSV-Tag was from Novagen (Madison, WI). Polyclonal antibodies raised against human β3 integrins were a gift from Dr. B. Bednar (Merck). Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and TRITC-conjugated IgGs were from The Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG was from Amersham Biosciences, and Oregon Green 488 phalloidin was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Pre-fusion osteoclasts (pOCs) were prepared as described previously (26Wesolowski G. Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nagy R.M. Tezuka K. Tanaka H. Rodan G.A. Rodan S.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 679-686Google Scholar). Briefly, pre-fusion osteoclasts were obtained from co-cultures of osteoblastic MB1.8 cells and murine bone marrow cells in α-MEM containing 10% FBS and 10 nm1α,25(OH)2D3. After 5 days in co-culture, pOCs were released from dishes with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer after removing MB1.8 cells with 0.1% (w/v) collagenase and dispase in PBS. The recombinant, replication-deficient adenovirus vectors were constructed using pΔE1sp1 plasmid consisting of human cytomegalovirus promoter and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation site as described previously (27Bett A.J. Haddara W. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8802-8806Google Scholar). Before transfer into adenovirus vector, full-length murine PYK2 cDNA was cloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (16Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Google Scholar), and Lys-457 → Ala and Tyr-402 → Phe mutations were done using U.S.E. mutagenesis kit from Amersham Biosciences. All the constructs had HSV-Tag at their C terminus. Recombinant viruses were produced in HEK293 cells, purified, and titrated according to standard methods (28Hitt M.M. Addison C.L. Graham F.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 40: 137-206Google Scholar). Expression, kinase activity, and tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2(wt) and its mutants were first tested by infecting HEK293 cells. The cells were infected with recombinant viruses at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1–100. After 24 h, cells were washed once with PBS, lysed into modified RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a mixture of protease inhibitors), and used for biochemical analyses. To produce osteoclast-like cells (OCL) expressing PYK2(wt) and its mutants, two different strategies of viral infection were used. First, isolated pOCs were allowed to adhere for 1 h prior to infection with different m.o.i.s (plaque-forming unit per pOC) of recombinant viruses for 1 h in α-MEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After infection, 1α,25(OH)2D3-treated MB1.8 cells were added to support pOC survival and fusion. After 3 days in 10% FBS and α-MEM in the presence of 10 nm1α,25(OH)2D3, MB1.8 cells were removed by collagenase-dispase treatment, and OCLs were lysed and used for biochemical analyses. In the second strategy, the co-cultures of MB1.8 and murine bone marrow cells were infected with recombinant viruses at days 2 and 4 in culture. Viral stocks were diluted with α-MEM and added directly to the co-cultures. After isolation of pOCs, 300,000 cells were used for testing the expression levels of exogenous PYK2 by immunoprecipitation, using anti-PYK2 antibodies, followed by blotting with anti-HSV-Tag mAb. Infected pOCs were also used for analyzing cell adhesion and spreading on vitronectin, cell migration, bone resorption, and for immunofluorescent stainings. HEK293 cells, pOCs or OCLs expressing PYK2 and its mutants, or uninfected control cells were lysed into modified RIPA buffer on ice as described previously (16Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Google Scholar). Lysates at equal protein concentrations were immunoprecipitated using anti-PYK2 antibodies for 2–10 h at 4 °C, followed by G-protein-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, and washed with RIPA buffer (4 times). Total cell lysates or immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen), transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), which was incubated subsequently with primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed into Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) on ice. Lysates at equal protein concentrations were incubated for 2 h with anti-c-Src antibody, followed by G-protein-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, and finally washed with ½ times Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (4 times). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, blotted, and stained as described above. The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation and PYK2 were quantitated using an imaging densitometer (model GS-700; Bio-Rad) and expressed as fold of phosphorylated PYK2 in uninfected cells. Each was normalized to total levels of PYK2 in respective sample. HEK293 cells or OCLs expressing PYK2 mutants or uninfected control cells were lysed into modified RIPA buffer and precipitated with anti-PYK2 or anti-HSV antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by G-protein-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, and washed with RIPA buffer (3 times). Half of the immunoprecipitates were subjected to blotting with anti-PYK2 or anti-HSV antibodies, and the other half was washed once with low salt buffer (100 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mmMnCl2) and incubated with kinase reaction mixture (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 μm cold ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 15 min at 30 °C. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. pOCs expressing PYK2 and its mutants were allowed to attach to vitronectin-coated dishes (20 μg/ml, Invitrogen) at indicated times in the absence of serum. After gently washing with PBS, attached cells were fixed and stained for TRAP, and the cell area was counted using an image-analysis system (Empire Image System, Milford, NJ). Isolated pOCs were cultured together with 10 nm 1α,25(OH)2D3-pretreated (48 h) MB1.8 cells on dentine slices in the presence of 10 nm1α,25(OH)2D3 for 24 h. Cells were then removed by ultrasonication in NH4OH, and resorption pits on dentine slices were examined by scanning electron microscopy (ElectroScan model 2010). Cell migration was assayed using a Boyden chamber type apparatus (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) as described before (29Simon K.O. Nutt E.M. Abraham D.G. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29380-29389Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 nm M-CSF was placed in the bottom chamber and isolated pOCs at a density of 20,000 cells/well in the upper chamber. Cells were allowed to migrate through a polycarbonate filter for 8 h in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Then the cells that migrated to the bottom of the filter were stained for TRAP and counted from 10 sequentially selected fields using an Olympus IX70 microscope with a ×10 objective. pOCs expressing PYK2 and its mutants were allowed to attach onto vitronectin-coated glass coverslips for 1–2 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were stained using anti-β3 or anti-PYK2 polyclonal antibodies, and anti-HSV, anti-phosphotyrosine, and anti-paxillin mAbs, followed with the appropriate secondary antibodies, or with Oregon-Green 488 phalloidin. Stainings were viewed with a Leica TCS SP Spectral confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with Argon-Krypton laser (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation levels of exogenous murine PYK2(wt), PYK2 (Y402F), and PYK2(K457A) were first characterized in HEK293 cells, which do not express endogenous PYK2. Cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus constructs expressing HSV-tagged PYK2(wt) or the mutants at m.o.i. of 1–10 for 24 h and lysed for biochemical analyses. In vitro kinase assay of immunoprecipitated PYK2 shows autophosphorylation activity of wild type PYK2 and of PYK2(Y402F). This suggests that additional tyrosines in PYK2, beside the known major autophosphorylation site Tyr-402, can be phosphorylated in vitro. In contrast, the ATP-binding site defective PYK2(K457) mutant shows no kinase activity under the same condition (Fig.1 A). Western blots for HSV-Tag and PYK2 reveal expression levels of exogenous PYK2 and the mutants in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1 A,lower panels). Phosphorylation of various tyrosines in PYK2(wt) and its mutants was investigated using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies for PYK2. Fig. 1 B shows that in HEK293 cells, when expressed at the similar concentrations, PYK2(wt) was highly phosphorylated at tyrosines 402, 579/580, and 881, whereas only weak phosphorylation in PYK2(K457A) was detected at these tyrosines. Undetectable phosphorylation at Tyr-402, Tyr-579/Tyr-580, and Tyr-881 was observed in PYK2(Y402F). This suggests that phosphorylation of PYK2 at these tyrosines was initiated by the autophosphorylation at Tyr-402, which was previously suggested to recruit an Src kinase for further phosphorylation at the C-terminal tyrosines. Interestingly, the kinase-defective PYK2 appears to interact with another tyrosine kinase in HEK293 cells, which weakly phosphorylates Tyr-402. Our results also suggest that tyrosines other than 402, 579/589, or 881 is a substrate for in vitro kinase activity of PYK2(Y402F) as observed in Fig.1 A. Expression of PYK2 and its mutants in OCLs was characterized by infecting isolated pOCs at increased m.o.i. of adenovirus constructs and then culturing pOCs with osteoblastic MB1.8 cells to support osteoclast survival and fusion. After 3 days, MB1.8 cells were removed with collagenase-dispase, and OCLs were lysed for biochemical analysis. Immunoprecipitation analysis shows dose-dependent increase in the expression of all exogenous HSV-tagged PYK2 forms (Fig. 2). Concentrations of adenovirus resulting in ∼3–4-fold expression of exogenous over endogenous PYK2 were used in all following experiments. No defects in OCL growth or survival were observed at the highest expression levels of exogenous PYK2. Next kinase activities of PYK2(wt) and its mutants overexpressed in osteoclast-like cells were characterized in in vitro kinase assay. Fig. 3demonstrates high autophosphorylation activity of exogenously expressed PYK2(wt) in immunoprecipitates using anti-HSV antibodies. PYK2(Y402F) clearly displayed lower autophosphorylation activity as compared with the wild type, and no activity was found to associate with PYK2(K457A). Western blots for HSV and PYK2 demonstrate similar expression levels of exogenous PYK2 forms recovered in HSV immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3, left lanes). These results confirm the functional expression of PYK2 and its mutants in osteoclast-like cells, similar to that observed in HEK293 cells. In PYK2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3, right lanes), expression levels of exogenous PYK2 forms were similar (Fig. 3, blot: HSV) and 3–4 times that of endogenous PYK2 (Fig. 3, blot: PYK2, as comparing control to the last three right lanes in IP: PYK2). Autophosphorylation in PYK2 immunoprecipitates from osteoclast-like cells overexpressing PYK2(wt), PYK2(K457A), or PYK2(Y402F) results from both endogenously and exogenously expressed pools of PYK2. Phosphorylation levels of PYK2 in PYK2(K457A)-expressing cells were similar to that of endogenous PYK2 (comparing lanes 5 and 7 in in vitro kinase assay) in the uninfected cells, suggesting that endogenous PYK2 failed to cross-phosphorylate the exogenously introduced mutant. Because PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with its kinase activity in osteoclasts, we characterized phosphorylation pattern of PYK2 and its mutants in osteoclasts using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies. Similar to HEK293 cells, PYK2(wt) in OCLs was highly phosphorylated at tyrosines 402, 579/580, and 881 as found in immunoprecipitates using anti-HSV-Tag antibodies (Fig.4, A–C). Furthermore, PYK2(wt) was tyrosine-phosphorylated to the same extent as endogenous PYK2 in control cells, as determined by the ratio of Tyr(P) to PYK2 (Fig. 4, A–C), suggesting that exogenous PYK2 was fully activated in OCLs. In contrast to HEK293 cells, kinase-defective PYK2(K457A) in OCLs showed even higher tyrosine phosphorylation levels at tyrosines 402, 579/580, and 881 when compared with wild type PYK2. This suggests that PYK2 kinase activity is not necessary for phosphorylation of tyrosines 402, 579/580, or 881 of PYK2 in osteoclasts and implicates that another kinase(s) can efficiently phosphorylate these tyrosines in osteoclasts. However, PYK2(Y402F) showed no phosphorylation at Tyr-402 (Fig. 4 A) and only very low phosphorylation at Tyr-579/580 and Tyr-881 (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that phosphorylation at Tyr-402 is important for additional phosphorylation at the regulatory (Tyr-579/580) and C-terminal (Tyr-881) domains of PYK2 in osteoclasts. Tyrosine phosphorylation in PYK2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4, A–C,right lanes) results from both endogenous and exogenously expressed pools of PYK2. Because we demonstrated previously (19Duong L.T. Nakamura I. Lakkakorpi P.T. Lipfert L. Bett A.J. Rodan G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7484-7492Google Scholar) the role of PYK2 antisense in inhibiting cytoskeletal reorganization in osteoclasts during cell adhesion and spreading, we thus examined the effects of PYK2 mutants on spreading of pOCs on vitronectin under serum-free conditions. From the time course of pOC spreading as shown in Fig. 5 A, there were no statistically significant differences between the rate of cell spreading in control pOCs expressing only endogenous PYK2 and pOCs overexpressing wild type or kinase-defective PYK2. In contrast, spreading of pOCs overexpressing PYK2(Y402F) was severely impaired (Fig. 5, A and B, p < 0.001 at 30- and 60-min time points). These results suggest that the poorly tyrosine-phosphorylated PYK2(Y402F) functions as dominant negative PYK2 preventing cytoskeletal reorganization during osteoclast spreading. On the other hand, the kinase activity of PYK2 appears to be unnecessary for supporting osteoclast spreading. Next we investigated if reduced cell spreading, caused by overexpressing PYK2(Y402F), affects bone resorption. Control and PYK2(Y402F)-expressing pOCs were cultured on dentine slices together with MB1.8 cells for 24 h. The cells were removed, and resorption pits were examined by S.E.M. Only very shallow resorption pits were made by PYK2(Y402F)–expressing osteoclasts (Fig. 5 C,panels C and D), when compared with uninfected cells (Fig. 5 C,panels A and B). This indicates that expression of PYK2(Y402F) prevents both cell spreading and bone resorption, similar to cells expressing PYK2 antisense or to c-Src-deficient osteoclasts. Since the rate of cell spreading of osteoclasts overexpressing PYK2(Y402F) was inhibited in a similar manner as found in the Src-deficient osteoclasts and phosphorylated Tyr-402 has been suggested to mediate the recruitment of c-Src to PYK2 via its association to Src-SH2 domain, we investigated the ability of PYK2 mutants binding to endogenous c-Src in osteoclasts by co-immunoprecipitation methods. Fig. 6demonstrates the association of PYK2(wt) and PYK2(K457A), but not PYK2(Y402F) with c-Src (Fig.6 A), suggesting that phosphorylated tyrosine 402 of PYK2 is the major docking site for c-Src in this cell type. In addition, we could not detect any differences in the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 6 B) or kinase activity (data not shown) of c-Src in osteoclast-like cells overexpressing various PYK2 mutants, confirming our previous results that c-Src is not the substrate of PYK2 in osteoclasts. Since cell spreading was impaired in pOCs expressing PYK2(Y402F), we next characterized the localization of PYK2(wt) and its mutants in pOCs. Double stainings of HSV, showing the localization of exogenous PYK2, and F-actin showed that both PYK2(wt) and PYK2(K457A) can be readily localized to podosomes in pOCs adhered to vitronectin (Fig. 7, B,C,F, and G).

Corbeil D. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12425-12430Google Scholar). Remarkably, within the apical plasma membrane domain, prominin-1 is selectively associated with microvilli and other related plasma membrane protrusions rather than with the planar portion of the membrane (1Weigmann A.

This specific subcellular localization does not depend on an epithelial phenotype because prominin-1 is selectively found in plasma membrane protrusions when ectopically expressed in fibroblasts (1Weigmann A.

Röper K. Weigmann A. Huttner W.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2625-2626Google Scholar, 10Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Buck D. Blood. 1998; 91: 4390-4391Google Scholar, 11Corbeil D. Fargeas C.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 939-944Google Scholar). Although the precise physiological function of prominin-1 is incompletely understood, a clue about its role comes from studying human pathology. In a consanguineous pedigree from India, individuals afflicted with retinal degeneration are homozygous carriers of a frameshift mutation in the prominin-1 gene, which results in a truncated protein that is no longer transported to the cell surface (12Maw M.A. Corbeil D. Koch J. Hellwig A. Wilson-Wheeler J.S.C. Bridges R.J. Kumaramanickavel G. John S. Nancarrow D. Röper K. Weigmann A. Huttner W.B. Denton M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 27-34Google Scholar). In keeping with the preferential association of prominin-1 with plasma membrane protrusions (1Weigmann A. Corbeil D. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12425-12430Google Scholar, 2Corbeil D. Röper K. Hannah M.J. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1023-1033Google Scholar, 7Corbeil D. Röper K. Hellwig A. Tavian M. Miraglia S. Watt S.M. Simmons P.J. Peault B. Buck D.W. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5512-5520Google Scholar), prominin-1 is concentrated in the membrane evaginations at the base of the outer segment of rod photoreceptor cells, which are precursor structures in the biogenesis of photoreceptor disks (12Maw M.A. Corbeil D. Koch J. Hellwig A. Wilson-Wheeler J.S.C. Bridges R.J. Kumaramanickavel G. John S. Nancarrow D. Röper K. Weigmann A. Huttner W.B. Denton M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 27-34Google Scholar). Given the ability of prominin to interact with cholesterol within a specific membrane microdomain (3Röper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Google Scholar), it has therefore been proposed that this pentaspan membrane protein has a role in establishing and/or maintaining certain plasma membrane protrusions (8Corbeil D. Röper K. Fargeas C.A. Joester A. Huttner W.B. Traffic. 2001; 2: 82-91Google Scholar). The existence of several open reading frames (ORFs)2 in theCaenorhabditis elegans genome encoding predicted proteins structurally related to prominin-1 (9Corbeil D. Röper K. Weigmann A. Huttner W.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2625-2626Google Scholar) raised the possibility that prominin-1 may be the first characterized members of a novel family of polytopic membrane proteins occurring throughout the animal kingdom. The existence of a prominin paralogue in humans could potentially explain why the homozygous carriers of the frameshift mutation in theprominin-1 gene resulting in retinal degeneration (12Maw M.A. Corbeil D. Koch J. Hellwig A. Wilson-Wheeler J.S.C. Bridges R.J. Kumaramanickavel G. John S. Nancarrow D. Röper K. Weigmann A. Huttner W.B. Denton M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 27-34Google Scholar) lack other obvious pathological signs. In the present study, we report the identification, molecular cloning, cell biological characterization, tissue distribution, and genomic organization of novel mouse, rat, and human cDNAs encoding a membrane glycoprotein structurally related to prominin-1 and referred to as prominin-2. Furthermore, sequence analyses of mammalian prominin-2 as well as proteins predicted from several expressed sequence tag (EST) clones derived from various other vertebrate and invertebrate organisms, such as chicken, fish, fly, and worm, provide a first description of the prominin family. Nucleotide and protein sequence data bases were searched at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project data base, and Celera Discovery System by using the BLAST network services (13Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar). ScanProsite searches in Swiss-Prot and TREMBL protein data bases (including weekly releases of Swiss-Prot) were performed at the ExPASy Molecular Biology www server (14Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Google Scholar) of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (www.expasy.ch/). The exonic organization of human and mouse prominin-2, prominin-1, andDrosophila melanogaster prominin-like genes were determined by comparing a given cDNA with the corresponding genomic sequence using BLAST. Pairwise protein sequence comparisons were performed using the ALIGN program with a BLOSUM 50 matrix (15Myers E.W. Miller W. Comp. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 11-17Google Scholar) and multiple sequence alignments using the ClustalW program (16Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar). Molecular phylogenetic analysis was done using PHYLIP software (17Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) at the infobiogen server (www.infobiogen.fr). Reliability of the branching was analyzed by the bootstrap method with 200 replications (18Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Google Scholar). The EST clones, Life Tech mouse embryonic clone mp20c10 (GenBankTM accession numberAA396526) and human IMAGE clone qu80c08 (GenBankTMaccession number AI285647), were obtained from Resource Center/Primary Data of the German Human Genome Project at the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics; the human IMAGE clone qk36c08 (GenBankTM accession number AI92608), Danio rerio clones fb75c01 (GenBankTM accession numberAI545699) and fm10h05 (GenBankTM accession numberBG307062), D. melanogaster clones LD23965 (GenBankTM accession number AA820383), LD22538 (GenBankTM accession number AA817301), and LD16666 (GenBankTM accession number AA441662) were purchased from Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL); the human clone au65a10 (GenBankTM accession number AI929095) and chicken clone pgf1n.pk006.j1 (GenBankTM accession number BI065967) were from Genome System Inc. (St. Louis, MO) and University of Delaware Chicken EST data base of Delaware Biotechnology Institute (Newark, DE), respectively. All EST clones were completely sequenced on both strands by primer walking along the cDNA, using either the AutoreadTM sequencing kit and an ALFexpressTMsequencer (Amersham Biosciences) or the ABI PRISMTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and an Applied Biosystems model 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cloning of the murine, human, and rat prominin-2 cDNA sequences is described in detail in the Supplemental Material. The eukaryotic expression plasmid pCMV-prominin-2, containing the entire coding sequence of mouse prominin-2, was obtained by subcloning theHindIII–XhoI cDNA fragment released from the pCR-Blunt II TOPO-mouse prominin-2 plasmid into pCMV-Tag5c (Stratagene) digested with the same restriction enzymes. To obtain the pCMV-mouse prominin-2-myc plasmid, an XhoI site, destroying the wild-type amber stop codon of the mouse prominin-2 cDNA and allowing the fusion in-frame with the Myc tag cDNA of pCMV-prominin-2, was introduced by PCR using m3 (see Supplemental Material) and the primer 5′-cggtgggttctcgagcttcagagag-3′. The PCR product was digested with AccI and XhoI, and the resulting AccI-XhoI cDNA fragment containing the mutated 3′ region of the mouse prominin-2 cDNA was used to replace the corresponding wild-type cDNA fragment in the pCMV-prominin-2 plasmid. The pEGFP-N1-prominin-2 plasmid, containing the entire coding sequence of rat prominin-2 fused in-frame to the N terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP), was constructed by selective PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF508942) using the oligonucleotides 5′-tgcttcccagaattccgaaaccatgacgcgca-3′ and 5′-tcaccttgcccggtggatcccatagcttcagg-3′ as 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. The 5′ and 3′ primers created an EcoRI andBamHI restriction site, respectively. In addition, the nucleotide sequence flanking the initial start codon in the 5′ primer (see underlined letters above) was converted to a Kozak consensus translation initiation site to further increase the translation efficiency. The resulting PCR fragment was digested withEcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pEGFP-N1vector (Clontech). The bacterial expression plasmid pGEX-E3, containing the mouse prominin-2 cDNA from nt 1891 to 2193 (residues Ile582–Thr682) fused in-frame to glutathioneS-transferase, was constructed by selective PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNA using the oligonucleotides 5′-atacccacagaattcagcaggagc-3′ and 5′-gacactgaattcgagctaggtcacaagg-3′ as 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. Both oligonucleotides created anEcoRI restriction site, and the 3′ primer introduced in addition an amber stop codon. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and cloned into the corresponding site of pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). In all cases, the PCR DNA fragments were verified by sequencing. The recombinant glutathione S-transferase-prominin-2 fusion protein, containing a fragment of the second extracellular loop of prominin-2 (residues Ile582–Thr682), was expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli, purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (2Corbeil D. Röper K. Hannah M.J. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1023-1033Google Scholar), and used as antigen to generate the rabbit antiserum αE3 (alias SA7564) (EUROGENTEC Bel S.A. Seraing, Belgium). CHO cells were cultured as described previously (7Corbeil D. Röper K. Hellwig A. Tavian M. Miraglia S. Watt S.M. Simmons P.J. Peault B. Buck D.W. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5512-5520Google Scholar) and either double-transfected with the eukaryotic expression plasmid pRc/CMV-prominin containing the mouse prominin-1 cDNA (1Weigmann A. Corbeil D. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12425-12430Google Scholar) and the pEGFP-N1-prominin-2 plasmid, or transfected with the pCMV-mouse-prominin-2 plasmid or the pCMV-mouse prominin-2-myc plasmid alone, using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instructions. After 24 h, the medium was changed, and the cells were incubated for an additional 17 h in the presence of 5 mm sodium butyrate. Transiently transfected cells were then either used for immunofluorescence or solubilized in ice-cold solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and the detergent extract obtained after centrifugation (10 min, 10,000 × g) was used for deglycosylation, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting. CHO cell detergent extracts corresponding to one-fifth of an 80% confluent 60-mm dish, membranes from adult mouse kidney (50 μg of protein) (11Corbeil D. Fargeas C.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 939-944Google Scholar), or detergent extracts (100 μg protein) corresponding to one-eighth of an adult mouse eye prepared as described (12Maw M.A. Corbeil D. Koch J. Hellwig A. Wilson-Wheeler J.S.C. Bridges R.J. Kumaramanickavel G. John S. Nancarrow D. Röper K. Weigmann A. Huttner W.B. Denton M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 27-34Google Scholar) were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the absence or presence of either 1 unit of peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or 10 milliunits of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes (Millipore Corp. Bedford, MA; pore size 0.45 μm) using a semi-dry transfer cell system (Cti, Idstein, Germany). After the transfer, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% low fat milk powder and 0.3% Tween 20). Prominin-2 was then detected using αE3 antiserum (1/3000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, both diluted in blocking buffer. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system,Amersham Biosciences). Cell surface immunofluorescence analysis was carried out as described previously (2Corbeil D. Röper K. Hannah M.J. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1023-1033Google Scholar). Prominin-1 and/or prominin-2-GFP transfected CHO cells grown on glass coverslips were washed with Ca/Mg-PBS (PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mmMgCl2), first at room temperature and then on ice, and surface-labeled for 30 min at 4 °C by the addition of the rat mAb 13A4 (10 μg/ml) against prominin-1 (1Weigmann A. Corbeil D. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12425-12430Google Scholar) or mouse mAb anti-GFP (clones 7.1 and 13.1; 1/500) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted in immunofluorescence buffer (Ca/Mg-PBS containing 0.2% gelatin). Unbound antibodies were removed by five washes with ice-cold immunofluorescence buffer. Fixative, 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, was added to the cells on ice, and the coverslips were placed at room temperature for 30 min. The fixative was removed by three washes with immunofluorescence buffer, and the residual formaldehyde was quenched for 30 min with 0.1m glycine in PBS. The cells were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (H + L) or rhodamine Red-X conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Coverslips were rinsed sequentially with immunofluorescence buffer, PBS, and distilled water, and mounted in Mowiol 4.88 (Calbiochem). In experiments with fixed, permeabilized cells, prominin-2, prominin-2-myc, or prominin-2-GFP transfected CHO cells grown on glass coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then rinsed with, and incubated for 10 min in, PBS containing 50 mm ammonium chloride. In the case of prominin-2-GFP transfected cells, the fixed cells were permeabilized and blocked with 0.2% saponin, 0.2% gelatin in PBS (blocking solution) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated sequentially for 30 min at room temperature with mouse mAb anti-GFP (1/500) and rhodamine Red-X conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L), both in blocking solution. Coverslips were rinsed and mounted as described above. In the case of prominin-2 or prominin-2-myc transfected cells, the fixed cells were incubated sequentially with 0.2% gelatin in PBS for 30 min, PNGase F buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 25 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 unit of PNGase F for 3 h, and 0.2% gelatin in PBS for 30 min, all at room temperature. Cells were then double-labeled for 30 min at room temperature with αE3 antiserum (1/500) and mouse mAb anti-c-Myc antibody (clone 9E10; 1/100) (Sigma) followed by Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) and Cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch), all diluted in PBS containing 0.2% gelatin. Coverslips were rinsed and mounted as described above. The cells were observed with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope using a ×100/1.40–0.7 objective. The confocal settings were such that the photomultipliers were within their linear range. With prominin-1 and prominin-2-GFP double-transfected cells, the GFP and Cy3 fluorophore were excited sequentially to minimize potential of cross-collection of signal. The images shown were prepared from the confocal data files using Adobe Photoshop software. Northern blot analyses were performed using either mouse Northern blot membrane (Clontech, catalogue number 7762-1) or human Northern blot membranes (Clontech, catalogue numbers 7780-1 and 7782-1). Blots 7782-1 and 7780-1/7762-1 contain ∼1 and 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane, respectively. A BstEII-digested PCR fragment corresponding to nt 1880–2634 of the murine prominin-2 cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number AF269062) and an EcoRV-BstEII fragment (nt 1852–2617) derived from the 5.0-kb human prominin-2 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF245303) were used to generate the murine and human prominin-2-specific cDNA probes, respectively. For the selective PCR amplification of the murine probe, the sense m6 (5′-atacccacagaattcagcaggagc-3′) and antisense m7 (5′-gtcatgaggagaaagtgc-3′) primers were used together with the murine EST clone mp20c10 as template (see Supplemental Material). The PCR product was digested with BstEII, and the resulting 755-bp fragment was purified on an agarose gel. The human prominin-1 probe has been described previously (7Corbeil D. Röper K. Hellwig A. Tavian M. Miraglia S. Watt S.M. Simmons P.J. Peault B. Buck D.W. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5512-5520Google Scholar). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random-prime method using the Rediprime kit (Amersham Biosciences). In all cases, blots were prehybridized at 68 °C for 30 min and incubated with the appropriate radiolabeled probe at 68 °C for 1 h in the ExpresshybTM hybridization solution (Clontech). After hybridization, blots were washed at room temperature with solution 1 (2× SSC, 0.05% SDS), followed by solution 2 (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50 °C according to the Clontech protocol (manual PT1190-1). Blots were analyzed by autoradiography at −80 °C using Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film and an intensifying screen (3 and 7 days of exposure). The blots were then stripped and, before a new hybridization, re-exposed for 3 days to ascertain the complete removal of the radioactive probe. Northern dot blot analysis was performed using Human Multiple Tissue Expression (MTETM) Array membrane (Clontech, catalogue number 7775-1). The amount of poly(A)+ RNA in each dot of the array was normalized by the manufacturer to yield similar hybridization signal for eight housekeeping genes. Therefore, the amounts of mRNA in each dot vary from 50 to 956 ng, and the array allows for comparative analysis of gene expression in various tissues. The blot was hybridized with the human prominin-2-radiolabeled probe for 6 h at 65 °C and washed according to the Clontech protocol (manual PT3307-1). The blot was exposed for 2 days at −80 °C. For quantification, non-saturated exposures were scanned with an ARCUS II scanner and quantified using MacBas software (Raytest Isotopenmessgeräte GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). To identify potential vertebrate paralogues of prominin-1, data bases were searched with human and mouse prominin-1 sequences, and EST clones showing homology were sequenced and used to obtain full-length cDNAs by PCR amplification. This eventually resulted in the identification and molecular cloning of human, mouse, and rat prominin-2, as described in detail in the Supplemental Material. The ORF of human and rat prominin-2 cDNAs predicts an 834-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 91,900 and 92,800, respectively, whereas that of mouse prominin-2 cDNA predicts an 835-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 93,200 (Fig.1). For all three prominin-2 sequences, hydropathy analysis indicates six hydrophobic segments (data not shown). The first N-terminal hydrophobic segment most likely corresponds to a signal peptide. A potential signal peptidase cleavage site is found after serine 21 (Fig. 1, triangle). The other five hydrophobic segments constitute putative transmembrane domains (Fig. 1, solid lines). Strikingly, the similarity of the hydropathy profiles of prominin-2 and prominin-1 proteins suggests the same membrane topology. Consequently, human and rodent prominin-2, like prominin-1, are predicted to be pentaspan membrane proteins with two large extracellular loops, each containing more than 250 residues. Like prominin-1, prominin-2 contains a cysteine-rich region of as yet unknown function, which is located at the transition of the first transmembrane segment to the first small cytoplasmic loop (residues 128–136) (Fig. 1, asterisks). In all three prominin-2 sequences, the up to nine potential N-glycosylation sites are found in the two extracellular loops (data not shown), with six conserved in position, two in the first and four in the second loop (Fig. 1, ∨). The two large extracellular loops also contain six cysteine residues conserved in position between prominin-2 and prominin-1 that are likely to form disulfide bridges (Fig. 1, #). The predicted primary structures of mouse and rat prominin-2 are highly related to each other, with an overall amino acid identity and similarity of 88 and 93%, respectively. Human and rodent prominin-2 show ≈75% overall amino acid identity. Remarkably, the C-terminal domain, constituted in all three molecules by the last 34 residues, is perfectly conserved. (The lack of conservation of the C-terminal domain in the rat prominin-2 sequence reported by Zhang et al.(19Zhang Q. Haleem R. Cai X. Wang Z. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4788-4796Google Scholar), i.e. after our deposition of the first prominin-2 sequences in the data base in 2000 (8Corbeil D. Röper K. Fargeas C.A. Joester A. Huttner W.B. Traffic. 2001; 2: 82-91Google Scholar), is due to a sequence error; see Supplemental Material). Besides the C-terminal tail, the best conserved regions of human and rodent prominin-2 are the first (residues 106–127) and fifth (residues 782–801) transmembrane domains, with 91 and 95% amino acid identity, respectively. Human, mouse, and rat prominin-2 show only 26, 29, and 30% amino acid identity, respectively, to their prominin-1 paralogues. To corroborate further that prominin-2 has the same membrane topology as prominin-1 and, specifically, that its C-terminal domain is located in the cytoplasm, prominin-2 was expressed in CHO cells as a fusion protein, with GFP tagged to its C-terminal domain. By using an antibody against GFP as topological probe in immunofluorescence experiments on either intact (Fig. 2, A andB) or saponin-permeabilized (Fig. 2, C andD) prominin-2-GFP-transfected CHO cells, we could show that the GFP tag of the fusion protein was indeed located inside the cells (Fig. 2, B versus D), consistent with a cytoplasmic location of the C-terminal domain of prominin-2. Similar results were obtained with C-terminally Myc-tagged prominin-2 (data not shown), further supporting a prominin-1-like membrane topology of prominin-2. To analyze further the expression of prominin-2, a rabbit antiserum, referred to as αE3, was raised against a portion of the second large extracellular loop of murine prominin-2 (amino acids 582–682). Although this antiserum, upon cell surface immunofluorescence of transfected CHO cells, did not recognize the native form of prominin-2 (data not shown), it did reveal, upon treatment of fixed cells with PNGase F, the presence of prominin-2 at the plasma membrane (Fig.3 A). The authenticity of this immunostaining was confirmed by its dependence on the presence of prominin-2 cDNA upon transfection of CHO cells (Fig. 3,A versus B) and by the essentially identical pattern observed with the αE3 antiserum and anti-Myc antibodies upon immunostaining of CHO cells transfected with Myc-tagged prominin-2 (Fig. 3, C and D). In CHO cells transiently transfected with the full-length mouse prominin-2 cDNA, immunoblotting with αE3 antiserum revealed two bands with apparent molecular mass of ≈112 and ≈95 kDa (Fig.4, top and bottom panels,lane 3,arrowheads andasterisks, respectively). No immunoreactivity was detected when CHO cells were transfected with the expression vector alone (Fig.4, top and bottom panels,lane 5). The two-band pattern of prominin-2 was reminiscent of that of prominin-1 ectopically expressed in CHO cells (1Weigmann A. Corbeil D. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B."
https://openalex.org/W2093492638,"Phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates (PIPs) are potent modulators of Kir channels. Previous studies have implicated basic residues in the C terminus of Kir6.2 channels as interaction sites for the PIPs. Here we examined the role of the N terminus and identified an arginine (Arg-54) as a major determinant for PIP2 modulation of ATP sensitivity in KATP channels. Mutation of Arg-54 to the neutral glutamine (R54Q) and, in particular, to the negatively charged glutamate (R54E) impaired PIP2 modulation of ATP inhibition, while mutation to lysine (R54K) had no effect. These data suggest that electrostatic interactions between PIP2 and Arg-54 are an essential step for the modulation of ATP sensitivity. This N-terminal PIP2 site is highly conserved in Kir channels with the exception of the pH-gated channels Kir1.1, Kir4.1, and Kir5.1 that contain a neutral residue at the corresponding positions. Introduction of an arginine at this position in Kir1.1 channels rendered the N-terminal PIP2 site functional largely increasing the PIP2 affinity. Moreover, Kir1.1 channels lose the ability to respond to physiological changes of the intracellular pH. These results explain the need of a silent N-terminal PIP2 site in pH-gated channels and highlight the N terminus as an important region for PIP2 modulation of Kir channel gating.

Four subunits assemble to a channel. Each subunit contains two transmembrane segments with cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains and a connecting loop forming the pore (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Some members of the Kir channel family are endowed with gating mechanisms such as ATP gating (KATP channels) (2Ashcroft F.M. Annul. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 97-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) and pH gating (Kir1.1 and Kir4.1 channels) (3Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P.

These gating mechanisms are central for the diverse functions of Kir channels in physiology and the understanding of the related pathophysiology. Kir1, Kir4, and Kir5 channels, that are predominantly expressed in epithelia, are exquisitely sensitive to changes in intracellular pH in the physiological range (3Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Tanemoto M. Kittaka N.

This pH sensitivity is mediated by the protonation of a lysine in the N terminus (Lys-80 in Kir1.1) that induces closure of the channel's pore by an allosteric mechanism (pH gating) (3Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Even small changes in the pH sensitivity can cause severe kidney defects such as the Bartter syndrome (3Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), highlighting the physiological importance of proper pH gating in Kir1.1 channels. Kir6 channels display a very ubiquitous expression pattern and, in coassembly with the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR),1 represent the ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) (7Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P.I. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzales G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Intracellular ATP closes KATP channels by binding to the Kir6.2 subunits (ATP gating), whereas the SURs act as regulatory subunits endowing the channel with sensitivity to MgADP and pharmacological compounds. The ATP/ADP dependence of KATPchannels couples cell metabolism to membrane excitability, which plays an important role in the physiology of many tissues (e.g.pancreas, heart, brain) (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 2Ashcroft F.M. Annul. Rev.

Highly negatively charged membrane phospholipids, in particular the phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates (PIPs), such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), were found to interact with Kir channels, and in general they stabilize the open state of the channel (9Hilgemann D.W.

A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In addition, PIPs were shown to interfere with the different gating mechanisms of Kir channels. A recent report indicated modulation of pH sensitivity of Kir1.1 channels by PIP2 since a mutation in the C terminus (R188Q) that reduced PIP2 binding also changed the pH sensitivity (15Leung Y.M. Zeng W.Z. Liou H.H. Solaro C.R. Huang C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10182-10189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Further, PIPs are effective modulators of KATP channels because they reduce the sensitivity to inhibition by intracellular ATP (12Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 13Baukrowitz T. Schulte U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Science. 1998; 282: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The effect on ATP sensitivity is of particular physiological importance since the amount of ATP inhibition determines the activity of KATP channels in cells. Moreover, regulation of PIPs levels via signal transduction pathways represents an effective means to regulate KATPchannels by various receptors (12Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 13Baukrowitz T. Schulte U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B.

Nature. 1997; 390: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). PIP2 was shown to interact with basic residues in the C terminus of Kir6.2. For Kir6.2/SUR channels the basic residues cluster in two regions of the C terminus (176–222 and 303–314) (11Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 12Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G.

Physiol. 2000; 116: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Further, two regions in the cytoplasmic C terminus (20Drain P. Li L. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13953-13958Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and one region in the N terminus (21Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have been identified where mutations markedly reduce ATP sensitivity. Intriguingly, the two C-terminal regions (near 182–185 and 333–338) are in proximity (at least in primary sequence) to the regions that are implicated in PIP2 binding (176–222 and 303–314); however, the mechanistic basis of this coincidence is not clear. The region near Arg-50 in the N terminus has been implicated in ATP inhibition (21Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and we mutated, therefore, basic residues in this region (Lys-47–Lys-67) to screen for PIP2 binding sites. This approach identified Arg-54 as an important determinant for PIP2 binding in KATP channels that appeared to be vital for mediating the antagonizing effect of PIP2 on ATP inhibition. Further, we demonstrated that the N-terminal PIP2 site is silent in pH-gated Kir channels (e.g. Kir1.1) because they lack a positively charged residue at the relevant position. Introduction of a positively charged residue (e.g. arginine) largely increased PIP2 binding and, more importantly, impaired pH gating explaining the need of a silent N-terminal PIP2 site for pH-gated Kir channels.DISCUSSIONWe screened the proximal N terminus for residues that contribute electrostatically to the binding of PIP2 or ATP by substituting basic residues by the negatively charged glutamate (K47E, R50E, R54E, K67E). Two of these mutations altered ATP inhibition markedly. R50E reduced the ATP sensitivity about 12-fold, whereas R54E increased the sensitivity about 3-fold. However, neither Arg-50 nor Arg-54 are likely to contribute to ATP binding directly as detailed below.Arg-54 Is an N-terminal Determinant for PIP2 Binding in Kir6.2/SUR ChannelsThe mutation R54E resulted in KATP channels with very low P o upon patch excision that was largely increased by addition of exogenous PIP2 (PIP2-amplitude modulation) consistent with a reduced PIP2 affinity. In contrast, WT channels as well as the mutants K47E, R50E, and K67E showed nearly maximal P o upon patch excision, and exogenous PIP2 had little effect. The PIP2affinity of the different mutant channels clearly correlated with the charge at position 54 with WT and R54K channels having the highest affinity, R54Q channels an intermediate, and R54E the lowest PIP2 affinity. These results strongly suggest electrostatic interaction between Arg-54 and PIP2. Previous work has identified several residues in the C terminus of Kir6.2 as determinants for PIP2 binding, e.g. R176A was shown to reduce PIP2 binding (11Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 13Baukrowitz T. Schulte U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Science. 1998; 282: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 19Shyng S.L. Cukras C.A. Harwood J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The effect of R176A on PIP2-amplitude modulation was comparable to R54Q (Fig.1 C) suggesting similar importance for the binding of PIP2 to KATP channels. PIP2 binding of WT and mutant channels was also tested using neomycin inhibition as a relative measure for the PIP2 affinity. R54E, R54Q, and R176A channels showed a markedly increased sensitivity to neomycin compared with WT, K47E, and R50E channels. These results further substantiate the view that Arg-54 directly contributes to PIP2 binding.Arg-54 Plays a Key Role for the PIP2 Modulation of ATP Sensitivity in KATP ChannelsThe ATP sensitivity of KATP channels depends on the concentration of PIPs in the membrane. Increasing concentrations of PIP2 increase the IC50 value for ATP inhibition by several orders of magnitude (12Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 13Baukrowitz T. Schulte U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Science. 1998; 282: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and thus, the shift in ATP sensitivity for a given increase in membrane PIP2 should be related to the PIP2 affinity of the channel. We found that the mutations K47E, R50E, and K67E had virtually no effect on the PIP2modulation of ATP inhibition in contrast to R54E and R54Q. R54E/R54Q dramatically reduced the effect of PIP2 on ATP inhibition with R54E being more potent than R54Q. The results are in excellent agreement with those on PIP2-amplitude modulation and show that the charge at position Arg-54 determines the effect of PIP2 on P o and on ATP sensitivity.On the Mechanism of PIP2 Modulation of ATP InhibitionAs pointed out in the introduction, regions implicated to be important for ATP inhibition and PIP2 binding appear to coincide (at least in primary sequence) in the C terminus of Kir6.2 (19Shyng S.L. Cukras C.A. Harwood J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Drain P. Li L. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13953-13958Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This tendency seems to be even more striking with the identification of Arg-54 as a determinant of PIP2 binding in the N terminus since Arg-50 is an important determinant of ATP inhibition (21Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). On the mechanistic basis of this finding two explanations come to mind. First, ATP and PIP2 might bind to overlapping sites, and secondly, PIP2 modulates ATP inhibition allosterically by interaction with basic residues in regions that are critical for the gating mechanism that links ATP binding to channel closure. Both alternatives have been put forward recently (27Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Enkvetchakul D. Loussouarn G. Makhina E. Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2334-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 29Ribalet B. John S.A. Weiss J.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 391-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As an argument against physically overlapping binding sites it has been pointed out that mutations in the C terminus that affected PIP2 binding in the most cases did not change ATP inhibition (19Shyng S.L. Cukras C.A. Harwood J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This holds valid also for the N terminus. R50E markedly reduced ATP sensitivity but had no effect on PIP2modulation of ATP inhibition. On the contrary, R54E largely reduced the effect of PIP2 on ATP inhibition but had no direct effect on ATP sensitivity. Assuming electrostatic repulsion between R54E and PIP2 it is rather unlikely for ATP binding to occur in close proximity to position 54 without sensing the charge at this position. These results argue against overlapping binding sites for PIP2 and ATP in the N terminus and favor an allosteric mechanism. In other words the interaction of PIP2 with Arg-54 appears to disrupt the mechanism that allows ATP to induce channel inhibition. Accordingly, disabling the N-terminal PIP2 site is expected to reduce the ability of PIP2 to modulate the ATP sensitivity as seen with R54E/R54Q channels. The identification of several PIP2 sites in N and C terminus raises the question whether the sites are functionally equivalent. Are there PIP2 sites that preferentially affect ATP inhibition and others that are more important for control of e.g. open-state stability? Comparing R176A and R54Q suggests such functional heterogeneity. Both mutations increased PIP2-amplidude modulation to a similar extent (Fig. 1 C) suggesting that Arg-54 and Arg-176 contribute about equally to the effect of PIP2 on open-state stability. However, Arg-176 contributed obviously less to the antagonizing effect of PIP2 on ATP inhibition compared with Arg-54 (Figs. 3 C and 4 A). Moreover, none of the other potential PIP2 binding sites in the C terminus identified so far appeared to be very critical for the PIP2modulation of ATP sensitivity. Mutations at these positions produced significant effects on PIP2-amplitude modulation, but no marked effects on the ability of PIP2 to shift ATP sensitivity have been observed (19Shyng S.L. Cukras C.A. Harwood J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a pivotal role of Arg-54 for mediating the antagonizing effect of PIP2 on ATP inhibition.Role of the N-terminal PIP2 Site for pH Gating in Kir ChannelsThe arginine at position 54 is highly conserved among the Kir channel superfamily pointing to a general role for PIP2 binding in Kir channels. Indeed, a recent paper demonstrated that this arginine also contributes to PIP2binding in Kir2.1 channels (30Lopes C.M. Zhang H. Rohacs T. Jin T. Yang J. Logothetis D.E. Neuron. 2002; 34: 933-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Kir1.1, Kir4.1, and Kir5.1 present with a neutral residue at the corresponding position. A distinctive property of these Kir channels is a strong effect of intracellular protons on the open probability of the channel. This pH gating is mediated by a lysine residue (Lys-80 in Kir1.1) in the N terminus that serves as a pH sensor and is lacking in other Kir channels (3Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Protonation of the pH sensor causes reversible inhibition of channel activity in the physiological range. The unusual acidic pK a (≈6.8) of the lysine is thought to come about from its proximity to two arginines in the N and C terminus of the same subunit forming a “Arg-Lys-Arg triad” that shifts the pK a of the lysine into the physiological range via electrostatic interactions (3Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).It has been proposed that PIP2 binding to Kir1.1 alters the pK a for pH gating (15Leung Y.M. Zeng W.Z. Liou H.H. Solaro C.R. Huang C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10182-10189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether the absence of the N-terminal PIP2 site might be a prerequisite for Kir1.1 channels to operate in the physiological pH range (6.8–7.5). We observed, indeed, that introduction of an arginine at the N-terminal PIP2 site largely increased the PIP2 affinity of Kir1.1 channels and shifted the pK a for pH inhibition far out of the physiological range (pK a for I63R ≈ 5.8). It has been shown that reduction in PIP2 binding can shift the effective pK a for pH gating in Kir1.1 channels to more alkaline values. This was based on the finding that low PIP2 concentrations in the membrane or reduction in PIP2 binding, as seen with a mutant channel (R188Q), increased the pH sensitivity (15Leung Y.M. Zeng W.Z. Liou H.H. Solaro C.R. Huang C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10182-10189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We found that PIP2binding is already saturated for WT Kir1.1 channels since addition of exogenous PIP2 caused no additional shift in the pK a. This outcome does not conflict with previous findings (15Leung Y.M. Zeng W.Z. Liou H.H. Solaro C.R. Huang C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10182-10189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, it suggests that an increase in PIP2 affinity (e.g. I63R) should not alter pH gating and, thus, should not account for the effect of I63R on pH gating. PIP2 interaction with the N-terminal site might either reduce H+ binding to the pH sensor thus shifting the pK a of lysine 80 (e.g. though a change of the micro environment of Lys-80) or disturb the transduction mechanism allowing protonation of the pH sensor to power channel closure. Indeed, the reduction of the Hill coefficient for I63R (WT = 4.2 ± 0.3 and I63R = 2.2 ± 0.1, Fig. 5 D) might indicate reduced coupling between the pH sensor and the gate that controls channel activity. In conclusion, ATP gating in KATPchannels and pH gating in Kir1.1 are controlled by a N-terminal PIP2 site. While for KATP channels this site is necessary to allow potent modulation of ATP sensitivity by PIP2, a silent N-terminal PIP2 site is a prerequisite for intact pH gating in Kir1.1 channels. Even subtle changes in the pH sensitivity of Kir1.1 channels cause severe kidney defects as found in patients with the antenatal Bartter syndrome (3Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, a high evolutionary pressure to preserve a neutral residue at the N-terminal PIP2 site is expected and consistent with the absence of a positively charged residue in all pH-gated Kir channels. Kir channels are a superfamily of eukaryotic channel proteins that are expressed in many tissues and responsible for important physiological processes such as cell excitability, insulin secretion, K+ homeostasis, vascular tone, and regulation of the heart rate. Four subunits assemble to a channel. Each subunit contains two transmembrane segments with cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains and a connecting loop forming the pore (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Some members of the Kir channel family are endowed with gating mechanisms such as ATP gating (KATP channels) (2Ashcroft F.M. Annul. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 97-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) and pH gating (Kir1.1 and Kir4.1 channels) (3Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These gating mechanisms are central for the diverse functions of Kir channels in physiology and the understanding of the related pathophysiology. Kir1, Kir4, and Kir5 channels, that are predominantly expressed in epithelia, are exquisitely sensitive to changes in intracellular pH in the physiological range (3Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Tanemoto M. Kittaka N.

This pH sensitivity is mediated by the protonation of a lysine in the N terminus (Lys-80 in Kir1.1) that induces closure of the channel's pore by an allosteric mechanism (pH gating) (3Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), highlighting the physiological importance of proper pH gating in Kir1.1 channels. Kir6 channels display a very ubiquitous expression pattern and, in coassembly with the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR),1 represent the ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) (7Inagaki N. Gonoi T.

Intracellular ATP closes KATP channels by binding to the Kir6.2 subunits (ATP gating), whereas the SURs act as regulatory subunits endowing the channel with sensitivity to MgADP and pharmacological compounds. The ATP/ADP dependence of KATPchannels couples cell metabolism to membrane excitability, which plays an important role in the physiology of many tissues (e.g.pancreas, heart, brain) (1Nichols C.G.

Highly negatively charged membrane phospholipids, in particular the phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates (PIPs), such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), were found to interact with Kir channels, and in general they stabilize the open state of the channel (9Hilgemann D.W.

A recent report indicated modulation of pH sensitivity of Kir1.1 channels by PIP2 since a mutation in the C terminus (R188Q) that reduced PIP2 binding also changed the pH sensitivity (15Leung Y.M.

Further, PIPs are effective modulators of KATP channels because they reduce the sensitivity to inhibition by intracellular ATP (12Shyng S.L. Nichols C.G.

The effect on ATP sensitivity is of particular physiological importance since the amount of ATP inhibition determines the activity of KATP channels in cells. Moreover"
https://openalex.org/W1533490577,"Although angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) is recognized as an endothelial growth factor, its presence in brain following an ischemic event suggests a role in the evolution of neuronal damage. Using primary neuronal cultures, we showed that neurons express Ang-1 and possess the functional angiopoietin-receptor Tie-2, which is phosphorylated in the presence of Ang-1. We further investigated in vitro whether Ang-1 could protect neurons against either excitotoxic necrosis or apoptosis induced by serum deprivation (SD). A neuroprotective effect for Ang-1 was detected exclusively in the apoptotic paradigm. Treatment of cells with the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor, LY294002, inhibited Ang-1-induced phosphorylation of Akt, restored the cleavage of the effector caspase-3, and reduced the protective effect of Ang-1 against SD-induced toxicity. These findings suggest that Ang-1 has a neuroprotective effect against apoptotic stress and that this effect is dependent on the PI3-K/Akt pathway and inhibition of caspase-3 cleavage. This study provides evidence that Ang-1 is not just angiogenic but also neuroprotective. The understanding of neuroprotective mechanisms induced by Ang-1 may promote strategies based on the pleiotropic effects of angiogenic factors. Such approaches could be useful for the treatment of brain diseases in which both neuronal death and angiogenesis are involved."
https://openalex.org/W1996183050,"Proline oxidase is a p53-induced gene that can mediate apoptosis in lung carcinoma cells. Here, we provide evidence implicating a role for proline oxidase in renal carcinoma. We observed absent or reduced expression of proline oxidase in 8 of 12 primary renal cell carcinomas, with respect to their normal tissue counterparts. Two renal cell carcinomas, which displayed little or no expression of proline oxidase, expressed p53s that were less capable of inducing proline oxidase than p53 isolated from normal renal tissue. One of those tumor-derived p53s contained a double transition mutation at amino acid residues 125 (Ala to Thr) and 193 (Arg to His), and the other exhibited a single transition mutation at amino acid 149 (Ser to Phe). Forced up-regulation of proline oxidase induced the formation of reactive oxygen species and mediated apoptosis in the 786–0 renal cell carcinoma cell line. A proline oxidase antisense vector repressed p53-induced up-regulation of proline oxidase, release of cytochromec from mitochondria, and apoptosis in 786–0 renal carcinoma cells. Taken together, these findings support a role for proline oxidase as a downstream effector in p53-mediated apoptosis. We hypothesize that its altered expression can contribute to the development of renal carcinomas. The presence of proline oxidase in mitochondria, a primary organelle that regulates apoptosis, places this molecule in a subcellular localization that can directly influence the apoptotic pathway and thus tumorigenesis.

The presence of proline oxidase in mitochondria, a primary organelle that regulates apoptosis, places this molecule in a subcellular localization that can directly influence the apoptotic pathway and thus tumorigenesis. The product of the p53 gene plays pivotal roles in several biological processes that are important in reducing the tumorigenic potential of cells. The protein mediates cell growth arrest by controlling cell cycle checkpoints (1Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Google Scholar), induces apoptosis (2Lin D. Shields M.T. Ullrich S.J. Apella E. Mercer W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 9210-9214Google Scholar), and can influence the differentiation state of cells (3Aloni-Grinstein R. Zanbar I. Alboum I. Goldfinger N. Rotter V. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3297-3305Google Scholar). Many studies have implicated p53 in genomic stability, surveillance of DNA damage, and DNA repair, which are related to its control over cell growth (4Lane D.P.

A series of p53-induced genes has been identified by a serial analysis of gene expression in a colon carcinoma cell line; some of those genes are predicted to encode proteins that could generate or respond to oxidative stress (10Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Google Scholar). We performed a comparative gene expression analysis between p53-sensitive and -resistant cells, which also revealed the close association of redox enzymes with p53-mediated apoptosis (11Maxwell S.A. Davis G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 24: 13009-13014Google Scholar). One of those redox enzymes, proline oxidase, and its product, pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), 1The abbreviations used are: P5C, pyrroline-5-carboxylate; GFP, green fluorescence protein; RT, reverse transcription; DIC, 2,6-dicholoroindophenol; POX, proline oxidase 1The abbreviations used are: P5C, pyrroline-5-carboxylate; GFP, green fluorescence protein; RT, reverse transcription; DIC, 2,6-dicholoroindophenol; POX, proline oxidase exhibited the ability to inhibit cell growth and to induce marked apoptosis in a lung carcinoma cell line, implicating a role for the proline/P5C cycle in p53-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis (11Maxwell S.A. Davis G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 24: 13009-13014Google Scholar). Our work was supported by a later study showing that proline oxidase can generate reactive oxygen species (12Donald S.P. Sun X.Y. Hu C.A. Yu J. Mei J.M. Valle D. Phang J.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1810-1815Google Scholar), which can initiate apoptosis by directly acting on the mitochondrial permeability core complex and effecting the mitochondrial permeability transition (13Li P.F. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6027-6036Google Scholar, 14Jacotot E. Costantini P. Laboureau E. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Here, we report that the expression of proline oxidase was absent or reduced in a significant number of renal cell carcinomas, which was associated with mutant p53 in two cases. A correlation of reduced proline oxidase expression with mutated p53 in two cases of renal carcinoma and the ability of proline oxidase to induce apoptosis in renal carcinoma cells functionally implicate the enzyme as a downstream player in p53-mediated apoptosis. The p53 monoclonal antibody, Bp53–12, was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, the M30 antibody specific for the caspase-cleaved form of cytokeratin 18 (16) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, a monoclonal antibody for cytochromec (C-8) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and an actin monoclonal antibody (N350) from Amersham Biosciences. A proline oxidase antibody (T338) was generated in rabbits against a synthetic peptide composed of amino acids 338 through 353 of the proline oxidase protein (TGQLEPLLSRFTEEEE). Kidney p53 cDNAs isolated by reverse-transcription PCR from primary kidney tissues were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 ECHO expression system (Invitrogen). The complete proline oxidase cDNA was cloned into the pAdtrack vector (17He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Google Scholar), which coexpresses GFP as a normalization control for transfection efficiency. The pAdtrack-proline oxidase vector was used to generate recombinant adenovirus using a simplified procedure as previously described (17He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Google Scholar). A proline oxidase antisense vector was constructed by subcloning the proline oxidase cDNA encoding amino acids 186–516 in the pEGFPC2 expression vector (Clontech) in the antisense orientation. The proline oxidase and a wild type p53 recombinant adenovirus were amplified in 293 cells and virus-containing medium used to infect kidney cells. The 786–0 renal carcinoma and the H1299 nonsmall cell lung carcinoma cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Type Collection and propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. To conduct transfections of renal and lung carcinoma cells, a T75 flask of confluent cells was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 3 ml of Optimem medium (Invitrogen) containing 4 μg of plasmid DNA and 3 μl of LipofectAMINE-2000 (Invitrogen). The transfection medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and the cells incubated for 24–36 h to allow expression of the transfected gene. To normalize for transfection efficiency, pAdtrack, which expresses green fluorescence protein, was included in the transfection assay where appropriate. Western blotting was performed by using the SuperSignal immunodetection system (Pierce Chemical), as previously described (18Maxwell S.A. Davis G.E. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 277-290Google Scholar). Proline oxidase activity was detected by the reduction of the colorimetric indicator 2,6-dicholoroindophenol (an electron acceptor) as a result of oxidation of proline in extracts of isolated mitochondria, as previously described (19Sakuraba H. Takamatsu Y. Satomura T. Kawakami R. Oshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1470-1475Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated by homogenization of cells in a 0.25 m sucrose buffer (20Phang J.M. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1985; 25: 91-132Google Scholar). After microcentrifugation of whole-cell lysates, the mitochondria-enriched pellet was washed twice in sucrose buffer. Flow cytometry to quantitate apoptosis was performed on ethanol-fixed and permeabilized cells that were stained with propidium iodide according to a previously published protocol (11Maxwell S.A. Davis G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 24: 13009-13014Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells were quantitated in the subG1 DNA content portion of the flow cytometric scans. Reactive oxygen species were detected by the oxidation of dihydroethidium in the cytoplasm of viable cells. The oxidized compound then migrated to the nucleus as ethidium bromide and emitted a red-orange fluorescence under ultraviolet light when bound to DNA (21Huang C. Zhang Z. Ding M. Li J. Leonard S.S. Shen H.M. Butterworth L. Lu Y. Costa M. Rojanasakul Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32516-32522Google Scholar). Early apoptosis was detected by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody (M30) specific for the caspase-cleaved form of cytokeratin 18 (16, 22), according to the manufacturer's specifications (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Apoptotic cells were also identified by morphological criteria that included cell blebbing, fragmented and shrunken nuclei, and apoptotic bodies. Paired normal/tumor cDNA blot arrays were purchased from Clontech. The cDNA blot was hybridized with a proline oxidase cDNA probe according to the manufacturer's specifications and then rehybridized with an ubiquitin probe for the purpose of normalizing the expression data. Paired normal and carcinoma cDNAs generated from kidney tissues were purchased from Clontech. RT-PCR on nonsmall cell lung and renal carcinoma cell lines was performed by isolating total RNA using the TRI reagent extraction solution (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) and generating cDNA from the RNA by using the RT-for-PCR system (Clontech). RT-PCR to analyze p53, proline oxidase, Bax, p21waf1/cip1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression was performed as previously described (11Maxwell S.A. Davis G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 24: 13009-13014Google Scholar). Ribosomal protein S9 primers for normalization of PCR were purchased from Clontech. A commercial array containing cDNA amplified from paired normal and tumor mRNA from 12 patients presenting with renal carcinoma was hybridized with a 32P-labeled proline oxidase cDNA probe (Fig. 1, upper panel). The cDNA was normalized by rehybridizing the blot with a ubiquitin housekeeping cDNA probe (Fig. 1, lower panel). The cDNA spotted on the membrane has been shown to correlate closely with the expression of a number of different known mRNAs in the tissue (Clontech). As shown in Fig. 1, five kidney tumors (POX panel, T row,lanes 3, 4, 5, 7,10) appeared to exhibit little or no expression of proline oxidase mRNA as compared with the matched normal tissue (N row), even though similar amounts of normal and tumor cDNA were present on the blot as shown by rehybridization of the blot with a ubiquitin housekeeping cDNA probe (Fig. 1, Ubiq.). When taking the ubiquitin normalization blot into consideration, it appeared that several other renal cell carcinomas exhibited reduced expression of proline oxidase mRNA (POX panel, T row,lanes 1, 8, 9). Reduced or absent proline oxidase expression thus occurred in two-thirds of the renal cell carcinomas that we examined. This tumor array data suggested that altered expression of proline oxidase is frequently associated with renal cell carcinomas. However, to validate the differential expression of proline oxidase between normal and tumor tissues that we observed in the tumor array cDNA blot, the cDNA derived from kidney 4 and kidney 7 normal and tumor tissues was subjected to PCR. As shown in Fig. 2, the expected 270-bp-size proline oxidase DNA product was generated from normal kidney tissue (N lanes) cDNA, whereas little or no product was derived from tumor tissue cDNA (T lanes), confirming the array data showing that kidney tumors 4 and 7 lacked apparent expression of proline oxidase. In both renal cell carcinomas 4 and 7, the reduced expression of proline oxidase was very specific, because transcripts for p53, p21waf1/cip1, and Bax were expressed at similar levels in both normal and tumor tissues, relative to the ribosomal S9 protein that was used as a normalization control. From an analysis of the classification and staging of these renal carcinomas, it appeared that reduced expression of proline oxidase was more prevalent in clear cell-type renal cell carcinomas at stages II to IV (Table I; tumors 1,7, 8, 9, 10). However, two clear cell-type carcinomas did display normal levels of proline oxidase (Table I; tumors 6,11). No differences in expression of proline oxidase were detected by the tumor array blotting method in three prostate carcinomas relative to their normal tissue counterparts (data not shown).Figure 2RT-PCR confirmed altered expression of proline oxidase in renal carcinomas. RT-PCR was performed on two renal cell carcinomas (4 and 7) that displayed reduced or absent proline oxidase expression in the tumor array analysis shown in Fig. 1. Ribosomal protein S9 was employed as a normalization control. The expression of p53 and two of its target genes (Bax and p21) was also investigated in the same experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IRenal cell carcinoma and proline oxidase expressionRenal cell carcinomaClassification/StageProline oxidase expression1Clear cell/grade II-III++2Poorly differentiated/grade III-IV++++3Unclassified4Grade III-IV5Unclassified6Clear cell+++7Clear cell/grade II/III8Clear cell/grade II/IV+9Clear cell/grade II/IV+10Clear cell/grade IV11Clear cell/grade II/IV++++12Unclassified++++Relative proline oxidase expression was determined among the different kidney tumors by normalizing with the ubiquitin control probe on the tumor array blot shown in Fig. 1.

Open table in a new tab Relative proline oxidase expression was determined among the different kidney tumors by normalizing with the ubiquitin control probe on the tumor array blot shown in Fig. 1. Absence of proline oxidase detected by the array was confirmed in tumors 4 and 7 by RT-PCR. To determine the biological function of proline oxidase in renal cell carcinoma, the 786–0 renal carcinoma cell line was transfected with the proline oxidase expression vector (pAdtrack-Pox-1) to up-regulate proline oxidase. Proline oxidase expression was determined by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and a colorimetric assay to detect oxidation of proline in cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 3 A, lane 3, little or no expression of proline oxidase mRNA was detected in 786–0 cells transfected with the pAdtrack-GFP expression vector, whereas considerable levels of proline oxidase transcripts were detected in cells transfected with the pAdtrack-Pox-1 vector (Fig.3 A, lane 4). Considerable induction of proline oxidase protein was observed in 786–0 cells 24 h after transfection with the pAdtrack-POX vector (Fig. 3 C,lane 3) or infection with two different isolates of recombinant proline oxidase adenovirus (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and 2). No proline oxidase protein was detected in 786–0 cells infected with a recombinant GFP adenovirus (Fig.3 C, lane 4). To measure proline oxidase activity, we relied on a method utilizing the reduction of the colorimetric indicator 2,6-dicholoroindophenol (DIC), an electron acceptor, as a result of oxidation of proline in extracts of isolated mitochondria (19Sakuraba H. Takamatsu Y. Satomura T. Kawakami R. Oshima T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1470-1475Google Scholar). Reduction of DIC results in a decrease in absorbance at 600 nm over time. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the reduction of DIC occurred to a significantly higher degree in mitochondrial extracts from pAdtrack-Pox-1-transfected cells than in mitochondrial extracts obtained from pAdtrack-GFP cells. Lysates of pAdtrack-GFP-only transfected cells were used as a blank for the absorbance. Forced overexpression of p53 in 786–0 cells by infection with the pcDNA3.1-wild type p53 expression vector or with the recombinant p53 adenovirus induced apoptosis (Fig. 6 A) and up-regulated the proline oxidase protein (Fig.4 A, mitochondria,lane 3). Expression of p53 was easily observed by Western blotting in 786–0 cells infected with p53 adenovirus, in contrast to the apparent absence of p53 protein in GFP-infected cells (Fig.4 A, whole-cell extract, lower left panel). Essentially all of the induced proline oxidase protein was observed in the mitochondria (Fig. 4 A,mitochondria, lane 3) with little or no enzyme located in the cytoplasm (cytoplasm panel, lane 3). Forced up-regulation of proline oxidase by transfection with pAdtrack-POX resulted in significant increases in apoptosis in 786–0 cells, as indicated by the increases in the subG1 population in flow cytometric scans relative to those in GFP-transfected cells (Fig.4 B).Figure 4Up-regulation of proline oxidase induces apoptosis and reactive oxygen species in 786–0 renal carcinoma cells. A, p53-mediated induction of proline oxidase in 786–0 renal carcinoma cells. 786–0 cells were mock-infected (lanes 1) or infected with GFP (lanes 2) or p53 recombinant adenovirus (lanes 3). Mitochondria were isolated 24 h after transfection, and cytoplasmic proteins in the postmitochondrial supernatant were acetone-precipitated. Proteins in mitochondrial and cytoplasmic pellets were solubilized in SDS buffer and analyzed for proline oxidase expression in Western blots by using the T338 proline oxidase antibody. Whole-cell extracts were also prepared by lysing 786–0 cells infected with recombinant GFP and p53 adenoviruses in SDS gel-loading buffer. The extracts were immunoblotted for proline oxidase (POX), p53, or actin (as a protein loading control). B, 786–0 cells were transfected with pAdtrack-GFP or pAdtrack-proline oxidase. 24 h later, apoptotic cells were quantitated by flow cytometry of ethanol-fixed and propidium iodide-stained cells. C, generation of reactive oxygen species in GFP-only and proline oxidase-transfected 786–0 cells. Cells were infected with GFP or proline oxidase recombinant adenovirus for 12 h and then incubated with dihydroethidium, which when oxidized by reactive oxygen binds to DNA as ethidium, emitting an orange-red fluorescence under ultraviolet light. Generation of reactive oxygen was then quantitated by flow cytometry of GFP and ethidium fluorescence. Proline oxidase-induced cells showed considerably more ethidium-staining than GFP-only cells, indicating the increased generation of reactive oxygen species. D, a dihydroethidium-stained proline oxidase-transfected cell (24 h after transfection) showing nuclear condensation and fragmentation that is characteristic of the later stage of apoptosis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Proline oxidase has been shown to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species (12Donald S.P. Sun X.Y. Hu C.A. Yu J. Mei J.M. Valle D. Phang J.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1810-1815Google Scholar). Dihydroethidium localizes in the cytoplasm and, when oxidized by reactive oxygen, binds DNA and emits an orange-red fluorescence under UV light. As shown in Fig. 4 C, proline oxidase-transfected 786–0 cells treated with dihydroethidium showed considerably more orange-red nuclear fluorescence than GFP-only transfected cells, indicating that proline oxidase induced the generation of reactive oxygen species. Fig. 4 C shows the condensed and fragmented nuclear morphology characteristic of the latter stages of apoptosis in 786–0 cells. Caspase-mediated cleavage of cytokeratin 18 is an event associated with the early stages of apoptosis (22Caulin C. Savesen G.S. Oshima G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1379-1394Google Scholar). An antibody (M30) specific for an epitope that is uncovered only in caspase-cleaved forms of cytokeratin 18 can be used as a marker of early apoptosis (16Leers M.P.G. Kolgen W. Bjorklund V. Bergman T. Tribbick G. Persson B. Bjorklund P. Ramaekers F.C.S. Bjorklund B. Nap M. Jornval H. Schutte B. J. Pathol. 1991; 187: 567-572Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry showed that 786–0 cells expressing both GFP and proline oxidase were specifically reactive with the primary M30 monoclonal antibody, as detected by the orange-red fluorescence emitted by the phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antimouse immunoglobulin (Fig. 5 A, right panels). Little or no orange-red fluorescence was detected in GFP-only transfected cells (Fig. 5 B, right panel). A direct role for proline oxidase in p53-mediated apoptosis was suggested from proline oxidase antisense expression studies. Forced up-regulation of wild type p53 in 786–0 cells by transfection with the pcDNA3.1-wtp53 expression vector induced considerable apoptosis 36 h after transfection (48%) (Fig.6 A). Cotransfection of these cells with wild type p53 and a proline oxidase antisense vector resulted in significantly less (18%) apoptosis (Fig. 6 A,p53+pox(antisense)) and suppressed expression of proline oxidase protein by up to 80% (Fig. 6 B, compare lane 2 with lane 1). Moreover, the proline oxidase antisense vector prevented p53-mediated release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (Fig. 6 C, compare lane 3 withlane 2). Our published work (11Maxwell S.A. Davis G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 24: 13009-13014Google Scholar) and data presented here indicate that proline oxidase is a proapoptotic p53-induced gene whose expression is frequently reduced or absent in renal cell carcinomas. We asked whether the altered expression of proline oxidase in kidney tumors might be associated with mutant p53 proteins. To determine the functionality of kidney tumor-derived p53, we cloned the p53 cDNAs from both normal and tumor tissue of kidneys 4 and 7. These p53 cDNAs were cloned into the ECHO expression system to determine whether they were capable of inducing proline oxidase in p53-null H1299 lung carcinoma cells. As shown in Fig. 7 A, Western blotting demonstrated that p53 cDNAs isolated from normal and tumor kidney tissues were efficiently expressed in H1299 cells (lanes 2–4). Reverse-transcription PCR revealed that p53 isolated from normal kidney 4 dramatically induced the expression of proline oxidase in H1299 cells (Fig. 7 B, lower level, comparelane 6 with lane 5). Up-regulation of the p53s from tumors 4 and 7 also resulted in the induction of proline oxidase transcription, albeit to considerably lower levels than that induced by the normal kidney p53 (Fig. 7 B, compare lanes 7and 8 with lane 6). Western blotting showed that the levels of expression of proline oxidase protein correlated closely with the expression of mRNA detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 7 A,lanes 2–4). Because both p53 protein and mRNA levels were approximately equivalent between the normal and tumor p53-transfected cells and proline oxidase mRNA and protein were differentially up-regulated by normal and tumor-derived p53s, we surmised that the tumor-derived p53s were less efficient at transactivating the proline oxidase gene. Sequencing of the p53 cDNAs was thus performed in an attempt to derive a structural explanation for the differential induction of proline oxidase between these normal and tumor-derived p53s. The p53 isolated from renal cell carcinoma 4 contained a double transition mutation at amino acid residues 125 (Ala to Thr) and 193 (Arg to His), and that cloned from tumor 7 exhibited a single transition mutation at amino acid 149 (Ser to Phe). We conclude that proline oxidase is a downstream mediator in p53-mediated apoptosis in renal carcinomas, based on a number of findings presented in this manuscript. First, up-regulation of p53 induced the expression of the proline oxidase gene. Second, a proline oxidase antisense expression vector suppressed p53-mediated apoptosis in a renal carcinoma cell line. Third, two renal tumor-derived p53 mutants were less efficient in inducing the proline oxidase gene than wild type p53 isolated from normal renal tissue. Fourth, forced expression of proline oxidase induced substantial apoptosis in a renal carcinoma cell line. Finally, proline oxidase can generate reactive oxygen species, which mediate apoptosis by influencing mitochondrial membrane potential by acting on the mitochondrial membrane permeability core complex (13Li P.F. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6027-6036Google Scholar, 14Jacotot E. Costantini P. Laboureau E. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 887: 18-30Google Scholar, 15Lee H.C. Wei Y.H. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 2-15Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism by which proline oxidase mediates apoptosis is not known, the enzyme might facilitate apoptosis through products generated from the proline redox cycle. Proline oxidase catalyzes the conversion of proline to P5C and transfers electrons into the mitochondrial electron transport with an intervening flavoprotein (20Phang J.M. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1985; 25: 91-132Google Scholar). The pair of electrons donated by proline can generate two ATP molecules. P5C is then shuttled outside the mitochondria where it is converted to proline by P5C reductase, altering the NAD/NADP oxidation balance. The NAD oxidation state has been shown to be important in the regulation of cell growth (23Slade N. Storga-Tomic D. Birkmayer G.D. Pavelic K. Pavelic J. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 5355-5560Google Scholar) and apoptosis (24Romanello M. Padoan M. Franco L. Veronesi V. Moro L. D'Andrea P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1810-1815Google Scholar), which can effect the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (13Li P.F. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R.

The data also demonstrate a direct role for proline oxidase in p53-mediated apoptosis of renal carcinoma cells. We have also observed alterations in proline oxidase expression in primary lung carcinomas, lung carcinoma cell lines, and a primary stomach cancer, 2S.

Here we describe the expression, in COS cells, of green fluorescent protein-tagged constructs of NTE and mutant proteins lacking the TM or the R- or C-domains. Esterase assays and Western blots of particulate and soluble fractions indicated that neither the TM nor R-domain is essential for NTE catalytic activity but that this activity requires membrane association to which the TM, R-, and C-domains all contribute. Experiments involving proteinase treatment revealed that most of the NTE molecule is exposed on the cytoplasmic face of membranes. In cells expressing a moderate level of NTE and all cells expressing ΔC-NTE, fluorescence was distributed in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like pattern. Cells expressing high levels of NTE showed aberrant distribution of ER marker proteins and accumulation of NTE on the cytoplasmic surface of ER-derived tubuloreticular aggregates. Deformation of the ER was also seen in cells expressing ΔR-NTE or enzymatically inactive S966A-NTE but not ΔTM-NTE.

Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 61-74Google Scholar, 2Kretzschmar D. Hasan G. Sharma S. Heisenberg M. Benzer S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7425-7432Google Scholar). mRNA encoding NTE is expressed in embryonic mouse neurons, suggesting the possibility of a similar function in mammals (3Moser M. Stempfl T. Li Y. Glynn P. Buettner R. Kretzschmar D. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 279-282Google Scholar). NTE was identified originally in adult vertebrate neural tissue as a protein reactive with the organophosphates (OP), which cause a syndrome of axonal degeneration (4Johnson M.K. Biochem. J. 1969; 114: 711-714Google Scholar, 5Johnson M.K. Rev. Biochem. Toxicol. 1982; 4: 141212Google Scholar). Elucidation of the part played by NTE in OP-induced neuropathy and neural development is of obvious neurobiological interest. However, NTE is present not only in neurons but also in a variety of non-neural tissues including intestine, placenta, and lymphocytes (5Johnson M.K. Rev. Biochem. Toxicol. 1982; 4: 141212Google Scholar, 6Williams D.G. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 817-829Google Scholar). Furthermore, the existence of a putative homologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Google Scholar) suggests that NTE may be involved in a fundamental process common to cells from yeast to neurons. NTE is conveniently detected in vitro by its ability to catalyze OP-sensitive hydrolysis of an artificial substrate, phenyl valerate (8Johnson M.K. Arch Toxicol. 1977; 37: 113-115Google Scholar). Using this assay, NTE has been shown to be firmly membrane-associated. Differential centrifugation of brain homogenates resulted in an enrichment of NTE in microsomal fractions containing elements of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and plasma membrane; attempts to further resolve NTE by density gradient centrifugation of microsomes were unsuccessful (9Richardson R.J. Davis C.S. Johnson M.K. J. Neurochem. 1979; 32: 607-615Google Scholar). In neural sections, immunoreactive NTE staining fills neuronal cell bodies, excluding the nucleus, and extends into the proximal axon; in addition, the rate of accumulation of NTE at a peripheral nerve ligature indicates that it is conveyed along axons by vesicular fast transport (10Glynn P. Holton J.L. Nolan C.C. Read D.J. Brown L. Hubbard A. Cavanagh J.B. Neuroscience. 1998; 83: 295-302Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with an ER/Golgi location for NTE. In keeping with the membrane-bound character of NTE, hydropathy analysis of its primary sequence predicts a transmembrane helix (TM) near the amino terminus (residues 10–32). Further examination of the sequence of the 1327 residues of NTE indicates two functional domains: 1) an amino-terminal putative regulatory domain of ∼700 residues that includes areas with similarity to cyclic AMP-binding proteins; and 2) a carboxyl-terminal catalytic/esterase domain containing the active site serine residue (Ser-966), which reacts with OPs (7Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Google Scholar). Various carboxyl-terminal constructs of NTE have been expressed inEscherichia coli to define the minimum polypeptide with OP-sensitive phenyl valerate esterase activity. A hydrophobic recombinant protein called NEST (NTE amino acids 727–1216) had this property and, although lacking the amino-terminal TM of NTE, associated firmly with phospholipid membranes and required this association for its esterase activity (11Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Google Scholar, 12Atkins J. Luthjens L.H. Hom M.L. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 119-123Google Scholar). In the present study, we expressed various green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged constructs of NTE in COS cells to relate the protein's molecular features to its enzymatic activity and intracellular distribution in eukaryotic cells. COS-7 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Culture (ECACC number 87021302). Antibodies to GFP and to calnexin were purchased fromZymed Laboratories Inc. and StressGen, respectively. TRITC and peroxidase conjugates of anti-rabbit IgG were from Sigma, and colloidal gold (10 nm)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was from British Biocell International Ltd. [35S]methionine (43.5 TBq/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. For generation of a full-length NTE carrying the GFP tag at the C terminus, two primers were designed to bring the human NTE cDNA in-frame into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) between SalI andBamHI sites (forward primer, 5′-AGATCGGTCGACCAGCTGGAATC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGTCGAGGATCCCAGGCATCTGT-3′). A 4-kb PCR product was generated from the human NTE clone D16 (7Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Google Scholar) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and cloned into pEGFP-N1 to produce pNTE-GFP (Fig. 1). To generate a construct deleting the first 42 amino acid residues, which include the TM at the N terminus, we designed a forward primer (5′-TGCCAAGAATTCCAGCCATGGATGGCCCCC-3′) to bring in a Kozak consensus, an EcoRI site, and a translation start codon. This primer was paired with a reversed primer (5′-TGTCGAGGATCCCAGGCATCTGTGGCTGAG-3′) with aBamHI site to remove the original stop codon to amplify a 4-kb PCR fragment from NTE clone D16. The PCR fragment was cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of vector pEGFP-N1. To construct an expression vector for the catalytic domain of human NTE lacking the first 680 residues of the full-length protein, a forward primer (5′-ATAGCCAAGCTTCCCGAGGCCGCCATGGGT-3′) was designed to make use of an internal HindIII site of human NTE cDNA and bring in a Kozak consensus for optimal transcription. This forward primer, with a reverse primer (5′-TGTCGAGGATCCCAGGCATCTGTGGCTGAG-3′), was used in a PCR reaction to amplify a 2-kb DNA fragment, which was cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of the vector pEGFP-N1 to make pNEST-GFP (Fig. 1). To generate a construct of NTE-GFP (designated ΔR-NTE; Fig. 1) which retained the first 157 amino acids (including the predicted TM) but lacked residues 158–673 (i.e. the putative regulatory domain), we designed two primers (forward, 5′-AAGCTTGCTAGCGAATTCCCCCACGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCGGCAAAGCTTCAGGAAGAGTGGCTTCT-3′) to amplify a short fragment of DNA from human NTE clone D16 containing the 5′ untranslated region, the translation start codon, and the TM. This PCR product was cut withNheI and HindIII and ligated into the long arm of pNTE-GFP pre-cut with NheI and HindIII and recovered from an agarose gel. To generate a construct lacking the catalytic domain (ΔC-NTE-GFP; Fig. 1) the appropriate region of human D16 NTE cDNA was amplified by PCR with the same forward primer used to make ΔR-NTE (above) and a new reverse primer (5′-TTGATGGGATCCAAGGTGCCCTCGGGAA-3′). The PCR product was cut with NheI and BamHI and cloned into the vector backbone of the construct pNTE-GFP to replace the full-length NTE-encoding sequence. Mutation of the active site serine (Ser-966) to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis was achieved by using QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the primers 5′-GTGGGCGGCACGGCCATTGGCTCTT-3′ and 5′-AAGAGCCAATGGCCGTGCCGCCCAC-3′. The mutation was verified by DNA sequencing and enzymatic activity assay. COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax-I (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 2% of both penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Transfection was carried out using PolyFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For fluorescent microscopic study, cells were plated at 4 × 104/well in an 8-well Lab-Tek II chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International) and transfected with various constructs after 24 h of culture. 24–48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized by methanol/acetone (50:50) at −20 °C for 10 min. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature and probed with anti-calnexin (1:400) followed by TRITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:400) with three washes between and after antibody reaction. Slides were mounted with Vectorshield ® mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescent images were acquired by confocal scanning using an argon-krypton laser and a Leica TCS-4D confocal imaging system. COS cells were plated at 0.8 × 106 in 10-cm dishes and cultured for 24 h before transfection. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization. The cell pellet was resuspended in TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), homogenized with 10 passages through a 25-gauge hypodermic needle, and centrifuged at 100 × g at 4°C for 2 min. The supernatant fraction was further centrifuged at 100,000 ×g at 4°C for 45 min in an OptimaTMTLX ultracentrifuge using a TLA120 rotor (Beckman). After removing the soluble cytosolic fraction, the particulate fraction was washed once by resuspension and centrifugation and finally resuspended in the original volume of TE buffer. Protein concentration was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). NTE (phenyl valerate) esterase assay was carried out as described previously (11Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Google Scholar). Soluble and particulate fractions were run on SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient gels), blotted, and probed with anti-GFP antiserum (1:1000) followed by peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) with final detection by enhanced chemiluminescence using Pierce reagents essentially as described previously (11Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Google Scholar). Relative levels of immunoreactive GFP in soluble and particulate fractions were determined by densitometry of the Western blots. Cells transfected with NTE-GFP for 48 h were harvested and homogenized in hypotonic TE buffer, and the post-nuclear supernatant was subjected to 100,000 ×g ultracentrifugation as above. The membrane pellet was resuspended in the same volume of TE buffer containing 0.25m sucrose and re-homogenized and used as sealed membrane vesicles. For proteinase K digestion, an aliquot of the membrane vesicles was incubated on ice for 30 min with proteinase K (4 μg/ml) with or without 1% Triton X-100. The digestion was terminated with 4 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and a 30-min incubation on ice to allow complete inhibition of proteinase K before SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-GFP. As a control, the same blots were probed with an antibody (StressGen, catalog number SPA-865; 1:2500) directed to the N terminus of calnexin, an ER protein; this procedure has been reported to detect a 70-kDa intralumenal fragment of calnexin (13Ou W-J. Bergeron J.J.M. Li Y. Kang C.Y. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18051-18059Google Scholar). cDNA encoding NTE was subjected to coupled transcription/translationin vitro at 30 °C for 75 min using [35S]methionine and a STP3 kit from Novagen, according to the manufacturer's instructions, in the absence or presence of canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega; 1 μl). Subsequently, proteinase K (0.2 μg) was added, and mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Reactions were stopped with 2 mm PMSF. After incubation for a further 20 min, samples were run on SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then subject to autoradiography. As a control, parallel reactions were run using cDNA encoding MADM, a mammalian protein cloned in this laboratory (14Howard L. Lu X. Mitchell S. Griffiths S. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 45-50Google Scholar), which (unlike NTE) has an amino-terminal signal peptide and a carboxyl-terminal TM. Transfected COS cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow recovery from trypsinization. In initial experiments, relative expression levels of fluorescent protein were determined using a BD Biosciences FACS Vantage system. Prior to electron microscopy, cells were sorted into pure GFP-expressing populations and were then spun down in a swing-out rotor at 3000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were processed for routine electron microscopy and for post-embedding immunogold labeling as described previously (15Dinsdale D. Green J.A. Manson M.M. Lee M.J. Histochem. J. 1992; 24: 144-152Google Scholar). Disrupted cell fractions were also used for immunogold labeling as described by Johnston et al. (16Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar). Constructs of NTE tagged at the carboxyl terminus with GFP, including the full-length protein, deletion mutants with either the amino-terminal TM segment (ΔTM), the putative regulatory (ΔR) domain or the catalytic (ΔC) domain removed, and a truncated polypeptide of similar length to bacterially expressed NEST (11Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Google Scholar) were made as shown in Fig. 1. FACS analysis revealed that, in the transfected cells, the relative mean levels of fluorescent protein expression were quite similar; mean values for cells transfected with NTE-GFP were about 2-fold higher than those with NEST-GFP, whereas cells transfected with the ΔTM- and ΔR- constructs showed intermediate values (TableI).Table IRelative mean fluorescence levels and esterase activities of various NTE-GFP proteins in particulate fractions of transfected cellsGFP-proteinRelative mean fluorescence levelaRelative fluorescence levels were calculated as percentage of those of full-length NTE-GFP based on mean levels determined by FACS analysis.Esterase activitybParticulate fractions were isolated from COS cells 48 h after transfection with the indicated constructs, and NTE (phenyl valerate) esterase activities were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are the mean and standard deviation of three separate experiments.%nmol/min/mg proteinGFP (vector)4.4 ± 0.5NEST-GFP45.518.1 ± 4.2ΔTM-GFP73.590.96 ± 37.4ΔR-NTE-GFP55.6230.6 ± 33.6NTE-GFP100.0395.2 ± 17.5a Relative fluorescence levels were calculated as percentage of those of full-length NTE-GFP based on mean levels determined by FACS analysis.b Particulate fractions were isolated from COS cells 48 h after transfection with the indicated constructs, and NTE (phenyl valerate) esterase activities were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are the mean and standard deviation of three separate experiments. Open table in a new tab Phenyl valerate esterase assays on soluble and particulate fractions from the cells transfected with the various constructs indicated that all the activity was confined to the latter fraction (data not shown); this may reflect the fact that association with phospholipids is required for NTE esterase activity (11Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Google Scholar, 12Atkins J. Luthjens L.H. Hom M.L. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 119-123Google Scholar). Esterase activities in particulate fractions from NTE-GFP- and ΔR-NTE-GFP-transfected cells were roughly proportional to the relative mean fluorescence intensity of the cells (Table I). The fact that ΔR-NTE has essentially identical catalytic activity as the full-length protein indicates that the R-domain is neither required for, nor does it substantially inhibit, NTE phenyl valerate esterase activity. Sequence homology within the R-domain with proteins that bind cyclic AMP (7Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Google Scholar) suggests that this nucleotide might modulate NTE catalytic activity. However, we have found no effect of cyclic AMP on phenyl valerate esterase activity in particulate fractions from NTE-transfected COS cells (data not shown). Mean fluorescence levels in NEST-GFP-transfected COS cell populations were about half of those in NTE-GFP transfected cells, but esterase activity in particulate fractions from NEST-GFP-expressing cells was only ∼5% of those from cells expressing the full-length protein (Table I). However, Western blotting of soluble and particulate fractions indicated that, whereas ∼90% of immunoreactive GFP in NTE-GFP-transfected cells was confined to the latter fraction, only ∼30% of GFP in NEST-GFP-transfected cells was particulate (Fig.2). Thus normalized for the amount of NEST present, the esterase activity in particulate fractions of NEST-transfected COS cells is actually about one-third of that in NTE-transfected particulates. Similarly, ∼60% of immunoreactive GFP was present in the particulate fractions of cells transfected with the ΔTM construct (Fig. 2) and, thus, when data in Table I are normalized on this basis, the esterase activity in particulate fractions from ΔTM-NTE-GFP-expressing cells is about half of that in NTE-GFP-transfected cells. When expressed in E. coli, NEST is able to fold to a catalytically active conformation in association with the bacterial membrane (11Atkins J. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24477-24483Google Scholar). The present results suggest that recombinant constructs of NTE lacking the N-terminal TM can also adopt a catalytically active conformation once they become associated with membranes in eukaryotic cells; thus, the major function of the TM is to facilitate more efficient association with membrane. Interestingly, hydropathy analysis predicts at least one TM near the amino terminus of all the eukaryotic NTE homologues but none in YCHK, a 34-kDa E. coli protein with homology to a ∼200 residue region surrounding the active site of NTE (7Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Google Scholar). Because NTE lacks a signal sequence, it is likely to associate with intracellular membranes with the great majority of the molecule exposed to the cytoplasm. To confirm this possibility, we showed that proteinase K treatment (either in the absence or presence of Triton X-100) of sealed membrane vesicles from NTE-GFP-transfected COS cells reduced the size of the GFP-immunoreactive polypeptide from ∼180 kDa (NTE-GFP) to ∼30 kDa (similar to GFP itself), indicating that the membranes did not protect NTE from proteolysis (Fig.3 A). By contrast, a 70-kDa fragment of calnexin (i.e. its intralumenal domain; see Ref.13) was clearly protected until the membrane vesicles were disrupted by treatment with Triton X-100 (Fig. 3 A). In a second approach to the question of the topology of NTE with intracellular membranes, we subjected NTE cDNA to in vitro transcription and translation in the absence or presence of pancreatic microsomes. The resulting polypeptide was not protected by microsomes from degradation by added proteinase K, suggesting a predominantly cytoplasmic disposition (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, in a parallel control experiment, the polypeptide formed by transcription/translation of MADM (a mammalian membrane protein with an amino-terminal signal sequence TM; Ref. 13Ou W-J. Bergeron J.J.M. Li Y. Kang C.Y. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18051-18059Google Scholar), which is imported into the lumen of the microsomes, was protected from proteinase K digestion (Fig. 3 B). In COS cells expressing either NEST-GFP or ΔTM-NTE-GFP, fluorescence was distributed in a pattern distinct from that in cells expressing GFP itself and was partially cytoplasmic and partially coincided with that of the ER marker calnexin (Fig.4). This pattern is consistent with the soluble/particulate distribution of these recombinant proteins detected by Western blotting and supports the view that both the C- and R-domains of NTE contribute to its association with the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane. An ER-like localization was observed for fluorescence in essentially all cells expressing ΔC-NTE-GFP but in only a minority of cells expressing full-length NTE-GFP (Fig. 4). In a majority of COS cells expressing NTE-GFP, intense fluorescence was observed in the juxtanuclear area, and those expressing ΔR-NTE-GFP commonly showed even more intense and bizarre patterns of fluorescence (Fig. 4). Calnexin appeared to colocalize with juxtanuclear areas of intense expression of NTE-GFP or ΔR-NTE-GFP in a pattern that was clearly abnormal (Fig. 4). Although some cells expressing ΔTM-NTE-GFP also showed relatively intense juxtanuclear fluorescence, calnexin distribution in these cells was relatively normal (Fig. 4). Similar morphological observations, (and those relating to esterase activity) were also made with transfected human HeLa and N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells using protein disulfide isomerase rather than calnexin as an ER marker (data not shown). Furthermore, the intense juxtanuclear fluorescence was not readily dispersed by treating the cells with brefeldin A (data not shown), an indication that NTE-GFP was not associated with the Golgi apparatus (16Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar). The ultrastructure of COS cells with intense juxtanuclear expression of NTE-GFP (Fig. 5 b) was compared with that of GFP-vector control cells (Fig. 5 a) to investigate reasons for the abnormal distribution of calnexin. Cells expressing high levels of NTE-GFP exhibited fine tubular structures (20–40 nm in diameter) contiguous with the ER, which was often distended to result in vesicles containing fine flocculent material (Fig. 5 b). In many of these cells the tubular structures were aggregated in the cytoplasm to form irregular clusters up to 7 μm in diameter. Immunogold labeling of resin sections demonstrated the localization of NTE-GFP to these membrane clusters (Fig.5 c). Greater resolution was obtained by immunogold labeling of disrupted cell fractions (16Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar), which clearly revealed the presence of NTE-GFP on the cytoplasmic face of these membrane clusters, whereas adjacent Golgi, mitochondrial, lysosomal, and nuclear membranes were not labeled (Fig. 5 d). Electron microscopy of cells expressing ΔR-NTE-GFP revealed even more markedly abnormal membrane structures than those observed with the full-length protein. These tubuloreticular membrane structures were up to 3 μm in diameter and contiguous with the ER (Fig. 5, e and f). Recently, we demonstrated that purified recombinant NEST catalyzes hydrolysis of membrane lipids in vitro (17van Tienhoven M. Atkins J. Li Y. Glynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20942-20948Google Scholar). We wondered whether the abnormal membrane structures observed in COS cells overexpressing NTE and ΔR-NTE, but not in those with ΔC-NTE, might reflect hydrolysis of membrane lipid. However, the same aberrant membrane clusters were observed in cells expressing the enzymatically inactive S966A mutant forms of both NTE-GFP and ΔR-NTE-GFP (data not shown). Thus, disruption of the ER and formation of the tubuloreticular structures appear to reflect a non-enzymatic property of the catalytic domain of overexpressed NTE. The abnormal ER morphology induced by overexpression of NTE is reminiscent of that described in COS cells overexpressing the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (18Takei K. Mignery G.A. Mugnaini E. Sudhof T.C. De Camilli P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 327-342Google Scholar), malfolded cytochrome P450 (19Ishihara N. Yamashina S. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J Biochem. 1995; 118: 397-404Google Scholar), and microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase (20Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1727-1738Google Scholar). All of these proteins are anchored in the ER membrane by at least one TM and have large cytoplasmic domains. It has been suggested that the ER membranes aggregate by the head-to-head association of the cytoplasmic domains of these proteins (20Yamamoto A. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1727-1738Google Scholar). Our present experiments showing that microsomal membranes do not protect NTE from proteinase K digestion (Fig. 3) indicate that the protein is probably anchored in the ER membrane via its amino-terminal TM with residues 33–1327 exposed to the cytoplasm. This topology is also consistent with the pattern of immunogold labeling of disrupted cell fractions (Fig. 5 d). When NTE is overexpressed, intermolecular association of the cytoplasmic hydrophobic C-domains could give rise to ER aggregation by the general mechanism noted above. The fact that overexpression of ΔTM-NTE-GFP does not cause gross redistribution of calnexin indicates that this ER aggregation requires NTE to be anchored via its TM. The leading role of the C-domain in the aggregation is emphasized by the relatively normal morphology of cells expressing ΔC-NTE. To some degree, the R-domain may hinder intermolecular association of C-domains, and this may reflect the exacerbated ER abnormality in cells expressing ΔR-NTE.

https://openalex.org/W2043984223,"In cyanobacteria, the biosynthesis of the phycobiliprotein and phytochrome chromophore precursor phycocyanobilin is catalyzed by the ferredoxin-dependent enzyme phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PcyA), which mediates an atypical four-electron reduction of biliverdin IXalpha. Here we describe the expression, affinity purification, and biochemical characterization of recombinant PcyA from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. A monomeric protein with a native M(r) of 30,400 +/- 5,000, recombinant PcyA forms a tight and stable stoichiometric complex with its substrate biliverdin IXalpha. The enzyme exhibits a strong preference for plant type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins; however, flavodoxin can also serve as an electron donor. HPLC analyses establish that catalysis proceeds via the two electron-reduced intermediate 18(1),18(2)-dihydrobiliverdin, indicating that exovinyl reduction precedes A-ring (endovinyl) reduction. Substrate specificity studies indicate that the arrangement of the A- and D-ring substituents alters the positioning of the bilin substrate within the enzyme, profoundly influencing the course of catalysis. Based on these observations and the apparent lack of a metal or small molecule cofactor, a radical mechanism for biliverdin IXalpha reduction by phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase is envisaged."
https://openalex.org/W2161631408,"Members of the transforming growth factor beta/bone morphogenetic protein (TGF-beta/BMP) family are involved in the control of hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and cycling. The activities of several members of this family activins and BMP-2, -4, -7, and -11) are controlled by antagonists such as follistatin. Because follistatin-deficient mice show abnormalities in vibrissae development, we explored the role of follistatin and activin in pelage HF development and cycling. We show here that during HF development follistatin mRNA was prominently expressed by hair matrix and outer root sheath keratinocytes as well as by interfollicular epidermal cells, whereas activin betaA mRNA was mainly expressed in dermal papilla cells. Compared with age-matched wild-type controls, both follistatin knockout mice and activin betaA transgenic mice showed a significant retardation of HF morphogenesis. Treatment of wild-type embryonic skin explants with follistatin protein stimulated HF development. This effect was inhibited by addition of recombinant activin A protein. Activin betaA transgenic mice demonstrated retardation of catagen entry, down-regulation of BMP-2, and up-regulation of expression of its antagonist matrix GLA protein. These observations suggest that follistatin and activin interaction plays an important role in both HF development and cycling, possibly in part by regulating expression of BMP-2 and its antagonist."

We now demonstrate that PP2Cα, a major mammalian isoform, inhibits cell growth and activates the p53 pathway. In 293 cell clones, in which PP2Cα expression is regulated by a tetracycline-inducible promoter, PP2Cα overexpression led to G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, PP2Cα induced the expression of endogenous p53 and the p53-responsive gene p21. Activation of the p53 pathway by PP2Cα took place both in cells harboring endogenous p53, as well as in p53-null cells transfected with exogenous p53. Induction of PP2Cα resulted in an increase in the overall levels of p53 protein as well as an augmentation of p53 transcription activity. The dephosphorylation activity of PP2Cα is essential to the described phenomena, as none of these effects was detected when an enzymatically inactive PP2Cα mutant was overexpressed. p53 plays an important role in PP2Cα-directed cell cycle arrest and apoptosis because perturbation of p53 expression in human 293 cells by human papillomavirus E6 led to a significant increase in cell survival.

This broad substrate specificity suggests that PP2Cα has diverse functions and that it may play a central role in the regulation of stress response, gene expression, and replication. Still, because of the absence of specific inhibitors and the presence of multiple paralogs, the precise role of PP2Cα in mammalian cells is not known. It is, therefore, important to identify and better characterize its specific physiological function(s). The p53 tumor suppressor exerts its antiproliferative effects, including growth arrest, apoptosis, and replicative cell senescence in response to various types of stress (21Bargonetti J.

The tumor-suppressor function of p53 involves its ability to act as a sequence-specific transcription factor (27Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar). Numerous p53 target genes regulating cell cycle and apoptosis have been identified, including p21, which plays a critical role in the induction of cell cycle arrest (28el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar). In normal cells, under nonstressed conditions, p53 is a short-lived protein whose activity is maintained at a low level through its interaction with MDM2, which targets it for proteasomal degradation (30Daujat S. Neel H. Piette J. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 459-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The precise molecular mechanisms involved in p53 activation are not completely understood. Posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, dephosphorylation (31Ahn J. Prives C. Nat. Struct.

Cell. 2001; 107: 815-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) are all thought to be involved in this process. Some of these modifications may stabilize the protein by interfering with MDM2 binding, whereas others may transform it from a latent to an active form or alter its cellular localization (35Ljungman M. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 36Pearson M. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7250-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the present study we analyze the role of PP2Cα as a negative growth regulator. In cells containing endogenous wt-p53, PP2Cα overexpression mediates cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase followed by apoptosis. This PP2Cα-directed growth arrest is imposed through the activation of p53. Although PP2Cα induction considerably augments p53 transcriptional activation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, attenuation of p53 rescues the growth-arrested phenotype and leads to increased survival. These findings implicate p53 as a downstream mediator of the antiproliferative effects of PP2Cα. For PP2Cα-pcDNA3.1 (wt-PP2Cα), a rat cDNA library (37Zauberman A. Lupo A. Oren M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2361-2366PubMed Google Scholar) was screened with probes derived from the rat PP2Cα gene (38Seroussi E. Shani N. Ben-Meir D. Chajut A. Divinski I. Faier S. Gery S. Karby S. Kariv-Inbal Z. Sella O. Smorodinsky N.I. Lavi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), yielding several PP2Cα clones. A clone encoding the complete PP2Cα cDNA was isolated and converted to a plasmid, enabling CMV promoter-driven transcription of the inserted cDNA. The complete coding sequence of PP2Cα was amplified by PCR and cloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), between theHindIII and ApaI sites. Sequence accuracy was verified by DNA sequencing after cloning. For PP2CαD239A (mut-PP2Cα), PCR was performed to introduce the mutation D239A into PP2Cα. Two PCR reactions were conducted in parallel, using PP2Cα-pcDNA3.1 as the template. In the first, the upstream primer introducing the mutation in the sense direction was 5′-CTTGCATGTGCTGGCATCTGG-3′; the downstream primer was SP6- 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′. In the second reaction, the upstream primer contained the internal PP2Cα sequence 5′-ACACGGTGCAGATAGAAGTG-3′ and the downstream primer contained the mutation in the antisense direction 5′-CCAGATGCCAGCACATGCAAG-3′. After purification, the resultant PCR products from the two parallel reactions were mixed and used as a template in a final PCR reaction mix containing the two external primers (the upstream primer with the internal PP2Cα sequence and the downstream with the SP6 primer). The resultant PCR product was cloned into PP2Cα-pcDNA3.1 via the EcoRI and ApaI sites. The sequence accuracy of the mut-PP2Cα was verified by sequencing. For inducible PP2Cα (PP2Cα-pcDNA4/TO), PP2Cα (wt or mut) was isolated from the pcDNA3-based vectors described above, via theHindIII and ApaI sites and subcloned into the pcDNA4/TO vector (T-Rex system, Invitrogen). A human wild-type p53 expression vector (pC53SN3) was kindly provided by B. Vogelstein. Reporter plasmids encoding firefly luciferase under the control of human mdm2 and cyclin G promoters were as described (39Zauberman A. Flusberg D. Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M.

Culture medium was supplemented with 1% glutamine, 1% of a pen-strep-ampho solution (Biological Industries, Israel) and 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries, Israel). T-RexTM (Invitrogen) is a Tet-regulated mammalian expression system based on the binding of tetracycline (Tet) to a Tet repressor and derepression of the promoter controlling the expression of the gene of interest (44Yao F.

Microbiol. 1994; 48: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). T-RexTM-293 cells stably expressing the regulatory plasmid pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen) were transfected by calcium phosphate/DNA precipitation with PP2Cα-pcDNA4/TO wt or mut, or an empty vector (pcDNA4/TO). At 48 h after transfection, cells were seeded into fresh medium containing blasticidin (5 μg/ml) and zeocin (200 μg/ml) (both purchased from Invitrogen). The selective medium was replaced every 3–4 days until foci became visible. Several clones were isolated and characterized. Clone 9, expressing high levels of wt-PP2Cα upon Tet induction, was used in all of the experiments. Mut-PP2Cα or TO (empty vector) stable transfected clones were pooled and used in the experiments described below. Stable cell lines were maintained in medium containing blasticidin and zeocin. For constitutive expression of the E6 protein, T-RexTM-293 cells were infected with the recombinant retrovirus HPV16 E6, kindly provided by L. Sherman (46Alfandari J. Shnitman Magal S. Jackman A. Schlegel R. Gonen P. Sherman L. Virology. 1999; 257: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to 75% confluence and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 2–5. Upon reaching confluence, cell cultures were split and subjected to G418 selection (1.2 mg/ml, Calbiochem). Pooled stable clones were used in all further experiments. Cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25 mm EDTA and lysed in 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, supplemented with protease inhibitors (CompleteTMsolution, Boehringer-Mannheim) and 2 mmNa3VO4. The cell debris was pelleted, and the protein concentration was determined in the supernatant using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (41Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., NY1996Google Scholar), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the relevant primary antibodies, followed by peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Jackson) and West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Coding sequences of PP2Cα were cloned into the pET-28b bacterial expression vector (Novagen), and the resulting plasmid was used to transform BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli. Culture of the transformants grown overnight at 30 °C, following induction by 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, led to overexpression of soluble and active PP2Cα. The recombinant protein was purified on a nickel-agarose column (Qiagen) under nondenaturing conditions and used for the preparation of mouse monoclonal antibodies as described (38Seroussi E. Shani N. Ben-Meir D. Chajut A. Divinski I. Faier S. Gery S. Karby S. Kariv-Inbal Z. Sella O. Smorodinsky N.I. Lavi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Immunoglobulin heavy-chain isotyping was carried out with an IsoStrip Mouse Monoclonal Antibody Isotyping kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polyclonal anti-p38 antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-human p53 (DO-1) antibodies were a generous gift from D. Lane. Polyclonal anti-p53 (CM1) antibodies were purchased from Novocastra, and anti-p21 (C-19) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Human specific anti-cleaved PARP antibodies (Asp214) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. A colorimetric method based on the tetrazolium salt XTT (47Scudiero D.A. Shoemaker R.H. Paull K.D. Monks A. Tierney S. Nofziger T.H. Currens M.J. Seniff D. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4827-4833PubMed Google Scholar) is based on the ability of metabolic active cells to reduce the tetrazolium salt XTT to orange-colored compounds of formazan. The test procedure includes cultivation of cells in a 96-well plate, addition of the XTT reagent, and incubation for 2–24 h, during which an orange color is formed. The greater the number of active cells in the well, the greater the activity of mitochondria enzymes, and the higher the concentration of the dye formed, which can then be measured and quantitated. T-Rex-293 cells expressing wt-PP2Cα, mut-PP2Cα, or empty vector TO (2 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate) were incubated for 24, 48, and 72 h in the presence or absence of Tet, (1 μg/ml). 50 μl of XTT reaction solution (Biological Industries, Israel) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The sample's absorbance was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at a wavelength of 450 nm. The reference absorbance (nonspecific readings) was measured at a wavelength of 630 nm. This assay is specific for the PP2C family and distinguishes it from the other classes of protein phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, and PP2B). It is performed in the presence of okadaic acid that completely inhibits PP1 and PP2A, EGTA that neutralizes the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent PP2B, and Mg2+ that activates PP2C. Thus, PP2C activity is measured as the Mg2+-dependent and okadaic acid-insensitive activity (1Cohen P. Cohen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21435-21438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphopeptide substrate in our assay, FLRTpSCG is derived from AMP-activated protein kinase and was previously shown to be a good substrate for PP2Cα (49Marley A.E. Sullivan J.E. Carling D. Abbott W.M. Smith G.J. Taylor I.W. Carey F. Beri R.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were prepared from transfected cells, and free phosphate was removed with a VivaSpin concentrator (cutoff 10,000 Da). Phosphatase activity was then measured colorimetrically as described (48Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay was performed in 30 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA) containing 5 μg of cell extract and 0.5 mm substrate FLRTpSCG (49Marley A.E. Sullivan J.E. Carling D. Abbott W.M. Smith G.J. Taylor I.W. Carey F. Beri R.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), in the presence of 30 mm MgCl2, 5 μmokadaic acid, and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin. After an incubation of 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 70 μl of cold assay buffer, followed by 25 μl of malachite green/ammonium molybdate reagent. Measurements were taken at 630 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Dynatech MR5000). A quantity of 500 cells/well was seeded in a 24-well plate and grown for 10 days (unless otherwise specified). The resistant colonies were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, stained with Giemsa stain (Sigma) and counted. T-Rex-293 wt-PP2Cα or mut-PP2Cα cells were seeded (1.5 × 106 cells per 6 cm plate). After 24 h, Tet (1 μg/ml) was added. After 0, 24, 48, and 72 h, the cells were harvested, fixed with methanol, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% NaN3. Propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) was added for nuclear staining, and the cells were analyzed in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS Caliber, Becton Dickinson). T-Rex-293 wt-PP2Cα cells cultured on polylysin-coated cover slips were incubated for 0, 24, and 48 h with Tet (1 μg/ml), fixed, permeabilized and stained with anti-PP2Cα (9F4) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody, as previously described (38Seroussi E. Shani N. Ben-Meir D. Chajut A. Divinski I. Faier S. Gery S. Karby S. Kariv-Inbal Z. Sella O. Smorodinsky N.I. Lavi S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cell nuclei were stained with propidium iodide. The slides were then observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM510). T-Rex-293 wt-PP2Cα or mut-PP2Cα cells (6 × 105 cells/well, in a 6-well plate) were transfected with a combination of plasmids (200 ng of each) encoding firefly luciferase under the control of the mdm2/cyclin G/or RSV promoters, and Renilla luciferase under the CMV promoter. The cells were incubated with or without Tet (1 μg/ml) for 48 h and then harvested. p53-null HCT116 cells were plated at 6 × 105cells/well, in a 6-well plate, and transfected with a combination of plasmids (500 ng of each) encoding firefly luciferase under the control of the mdm2 or RSV promoters, and Renilla luciferase under the CMV promoter, with and without wt-PP2Cα (2 μg) and wt-p53 (0.5–3 μg). The cells were harvested 48 h later. Firefly andRenilla luciferase activities were determined with a commercial double luciferase kit (Promega) using a TD-20e luminometer (Turner Design). Values of luciferase activity driven by the different promoters tested were normalized for Renilla luciferase readings in the same extracts. To obtain stable cell lines expressing PP2Cα, 293 cells were initially transfected with wild-type PP2Cα (wt-PP2C) or mutant PP2CαD239A (mut-PP2C) expression vectors. However, overexpression of wt-PP2Cα was found to be highly toxic to the cells and stable clones were not obtained. In contrast, cells expressing the mutated catalytically inactive PP2Cα yielded high numbers of G418 stable clones, similar to cells expressing the empty vector. Therefore, to obtain stable clones producing high levels of wt-PP2Cα, we used the T-RexTM system in which the tetracycline-inducible promoter regulates PP2Cα. T-RexTM-293 cells were transfected with pcDNA4-wt-PP2Cα, pcDNA4-mut- PP2Cα, or the empty vector pcDNA4-TO. Stable zeocin-resistant clones expressing high levels of wt- or mut-PP2Cα upon the addition of Tet were isolated and characterized. As shown in Fig.1A, both the wt and the mutated PP2Cα-expressing clones displayed a pronounced induction of PP2Cα upon Tet addition, whereas clones harboring the empty vector expressed only basal PP2Cα levels. The phosphatase activity in the wt-PP2Cα-expressing cells was significantly augmented after Tet induction (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, after induction of the mut-PP2Cα, the phosphatase activity in the treated cell extracts became lower than in the untreated cell extracts. Hence, this mutant may act in a dominant-negative manner, reducing the activity of the endogenous PP2Cα. Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by the induction of wt-PP2Cα. As shown in Fig.2, A and B, only 20% of the cells expressing wt-PP2Cα remained viable 48 and 72 h after the addition of Tet, as measured by the XTT assay. In contrast, cells expressing mut-PP2Cα displayed enhanced proliferation (up to 120%), supporting the notion that the mutant protein indeed acts in a dominant-negative manner, thereby reversing an inherent antiproliferative function of the endogenous PP2Cα. Tet treatment itself did not affect cell growth. The impact of PP2Cα overproduction on the ability of the cells to form colonies was examined by a colony formation assay. Incubation of T-Rex-293 wt-PP2Cα cells with increasing levels of Tet led to enhanced PP2Cα expression and to a reduced number of surviving colonies (Fig. 2, C and D, wt). After the addition of low levels of Tet (6 ng/ml), there was already complete inhibition of cell growth. High levels of the mutant protein had no effect on the clonogenic capacity of the cells (Fig. 2, Cand D, mut), demonstrating that PP2Cα phosphatase activity is indeed responsible for the growth- inhibited phenotype. T-Rex-293 wt-PP2Cα or T-Rex 293-ΤΟ cells were incubated with Tet (1 μg/ml) for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. As shown in Fig. 3, PP2Cα induction led initially to pronounced accumulation of the cells in the G2/M phase, followed 24 and 48 h later by the appearance of sub-G1 apoptotic cells. At 72 h, a considerable fraction (28%) of the cells underwent apoptosis. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis apparently resulted from the augmented phosphatase activity, as the inactive mutated protein did not alter cell cycle distribution (data not shown). Correspondingly, the wt-PP2Cα producers displayed typical apoptotic characteristics, including nuclear shrinkage and chromatin condensation (Fig.3B, arrows). In addition, we observed cleavage of poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP), which is split by caspases during the execution phase of apoptosis (50D'Amours D. Sallmann F.R. Dixit V.M. Poirier G.G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3771-3778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4A, cells expressing wt-PP2Cα displayed a significant increase in the level of cleaved PARP 48 h after Tet induction, whereas in the cells expressing the mutated phosphatase, cleaved PARP was not detected. Another typical parameter of apoptotic cells, DNA fragmentation, with the characteristic apoptotic DNA ladder was observed in the wt-PP2Cα-expressing cells (Fig. 4B). Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate that PP2Cα overproduction triggers an apoptotic response in 293 cells.Figure 4PP2C α induces an apoptotic response. A, T-Rex-293 PP2Cα cells (wt or mut) were incubated for 0, 24, and 48 h in Tet (1 μg/ml). The cells were lysed and the extracts were immunoblotted with anti-cleaved-PARP antibodies and anti-PP2Cα antibodies. B, T-Rex-293 PP2Cα cells were grown for 48 h with or without Tet (1 μg/ml). Low molecular weight DNA was extracted by the Hirt method (51Hirt B. J. Mol.

As shown in Fig. 5, the levels of p53 and p21, a major transcriptional target of p53, were elevated in T-Rex-293 cells, concomitant with wt-PP2Cα induction, 6 and 10 h after Tet addition. Under the same conditions, the expression of p38, used as a control, was unaffected (Fig. 5, wt). Interestingly, the induction of mut-PP2Cα was accompanied by decreased expression of both p53 and p21. At 48 h after induction of mut-PP2Cα, there remained only marginal expression of both proteins, implying a putative dominant-negative"

Such deficiencies can result from inborn errors in the MCM structural gene or from mutations that impair the assimilation of dietary cobalamins into coenzyme B12 (Ado-B12), the required cofactor for MCM. ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase (ATR) catalyzes the terminal step in the conversion of cobalamins into Ado-B12. Substantial evidence indicates that inherited defects in this enzyme lead to methylmalonyl aciduria, but the corresponding ATR gene has not been identified. Here we report the identification of the bovine and human ATR cDNAs as well as the corresponding human gene. A bovine liver cDNA expression library was screened for clones that complemented an ATR-deficient bacterial strain for color formation on aldehyde indicator medium, and four positive clones were isolated. The DNA sequences of two clones were determined and found to be identical. Sequence similarity searching was then used to identify a homologous human cDNA (89% identity) and its corresponding gene that is located on chromosome XII. The bovine and human cDNAs were independently cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Enzyme assays showed that expression strains produced 87 and 98 nmol/min/mg ATR activity, respectively. These specific activities are in line with values reported previously for bacterial ATR enzymes. Subsequent studies showed that the human cDNA clone complemented an ATR-deficient bacterial mutant for Ado-B12-dependent growth on 1,2-propanediol. This demonstrated that the human ATR is active under physiological conditions albeit in a heterologous host. In addition, Western blots were used to show that ATR expression is altered in cell lines derived from cblB methylmalonyl aciduria patients compared with cell lines from normal individuals. We propose that inborn errors in the human ATR gene identified here result in methylmalonyl aciduria. The identification of genes involved in this disorder will allow improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of this serious disease.

Enzymes dependent on the vitamin B12 coenzymes, adenosyl-B12 (Ado-B12) 1The abbreviations used are: Ado-B12, adenosyl-B12; CH3-B12, methyl-B12; MCM, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; ATR, ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; MTS, mitochondrial targeting sequence; DDH, ado-B12-dependent diol dehydratase 1The abbreviations used are: Ado-B12, adenosyl-B12; CH3-B12, methyl-B12; MCM, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; ATR, ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; MTS, mitochondrial targeting sequence; DDH, ado-B12-dependent diol dehydratase and methyl-B12 (CH3-B12), have a broad but uneven distribution among living forms (1$$Google Scholar, 2Dolphin D. B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982Google Scholar, 3$$Google Scholar). In higher animals, two B12-dependent enzymes are known. CH3-B12-dependent methionine synthase is needed for the methylation of homocysteine to methionine (4Cauthen S.E. Foster M.A. Woods D.D. Biochem. J. 1966; 98: 630-635Google Scholar, 5Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 338: 687-692Google Scholar), and Ado-B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) plays an essential role in the conversion of propionyl-CoA to the trichloroacetic acid cycle intermediate, succinyl-CoA (6Banerjee R. Chowdhury S. Banerjee J. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 707-730Google Scholar, 7Matthews R.G. Banerjee J. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 681-706Google Scholar). This latter process occurs in three steps: propionyl-CoA is carboxylated to (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, isomerized to (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA, and finally rearranged to succinyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by Ado-B12-dependent MCM (Fig. 1). In higher animals, propionyl-CoA is produced from the breakdown of the amino acids valine, isoleucine, methionine, and threonine, as well as thymine, cholesterol, and odd-chain fatty acids; hence, MCM is essential for the complete catabolism of each of these compounds (6Banerjee R. Chowdhury S. Banerjee J. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 707-730Google Scholar). In humans, inherited defects that impair the activity of Ado-B12-dependent MCM lead to methylmalonyl aciduria, a rare but severe disease that is often fatal in the 1st year of life (8Rosenblatt D.S. Fenton W.A. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 367-384Google Scholar, 9Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S.

The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2000: 2165-2192Google Scholar). Such inherited deficiencies can result from mutations in the MCM structural gene (mut) or from mutations that impair the acquisition of the required cofactor, Ado-B12 (8Rosenblatt D.S. Fenton W.A. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 367-384Google Scholar, 9Watkins D. Rosenblatt D.S. The Endocrinologist. 2001; 11: 98-104Google Scholar). Higher animals are incapable of de novo synthesis and, hence, must obtain Ado-B12 by synthesis from complex precursors taken up from the diet (1$$Google Scholar). Suitable precursors include vitamin B12 (CN-B12) and other cobalamins with various β-ligands (X-B12s) (1$$Google Scholar). The pathway by which X-B12s are converted to Ado-B12 has been studied in several organisms and is thought to be similar in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Fig.1); X-B12 is converted to glutathionyl-B12 (GS-B12), reduced to cob(II)alamin, further reduced to cob(I)alamin, and finally adenosylated to Ado-B12 (11Watanabe F.

In humans, four complementation groups (cblABCD), associated with methylmalonyl aciduria, are thought to correspond to genes involved in the conversion of X-B12s to Ado-B12. Enzymatic assays of fibroblast extracts have indicated that the cblC and cblD complementation groups encode cytoplasmic enzyme(s) needed for the conversion of X-B12s to cob(II)alamin (16Mellman I. Willard H.F. Youngdahl-Turner P. Rosenberg L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11847-11853Google Scholar). Similar studies have indicated that thecblA and cblB complementation groups correspond to a mitochondrial cob(II)alamin reductase and an ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase (ATR) enzymes, respectively (17Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 98: 283-289Google Scholar, 18Mahoney M.J. Hart A.C. Steen V.D. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2799-2803Google Scholar). To date, the human genes that correspond to the cblABCD complementation groups have not been identified. Progress in this area has been slow due the difficulties in purifying the relevant proteins (19Rosenblatt D.S. Cooper A.B. Bioessays. 1990; 12: 331-334Google Scholar). We recently identified the PduO ATR of Salmonella, and showed that this enzyme has partial functional redundancy with the CobA enzyme (20Johnson C.L.V.J. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Google Scholar). In these studies, it was also shown that aSalmonella pduO cobA double mutant lacked Ado-B12-dependent diol dehydratase (DDH) activity due to the ATR deficiency. Furthermore, it was found that a plasmid-encoded source of ATR enzyme restored DDH activity to a cobA pduOdouble mutant (20Johnson C.L.V.J. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Google Scholar). Because this enzymatic activity can be readily detected on aldehyde indicator medium, we expected that the ATR-deficient Salmonella strain could be used to screen expression libraries for cDNAs that encode ATR enzymes. Such an approach would circumvent the difficulties associated with ATR purification. Here, we report the isolation of an ATR cDNA, from a bovine liver library, by complementation of an ATR-deficient Salmonellamutant for color formation on aldehyde indicator medium. Subsequently, the homologous human cDNA and its corresponding gene were identified by sequence similarity searching. Both the human and bovine cDNAs are shown to express ATR activity and complement an ATR-deficient bacterial mutant. In addition, Western blots were used to show that expression of the human ATR was altered in cell lines derived from three cblB patients compared with a cell line derived from a normal individual. We propose that the human gene identified here coincides with the cblB complementation group, defects in which lead to methylmalonyl aciduria. The identification of genes involved in methylmalonyl aciduria is important for the development of improved methods for the diagnoses and treatment of this devastating disorder. Vitamin B12 (CN-B12) and hydroxy-B12 (HO-B12) were purchased from Sigma. Titanium(III) citrate was prepared as described previously (21Bobik T.A. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1423-1427Google Scholar). 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) were from Diagnostic Chemicals Ltd., Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. Other chemicals were from Fisher. Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The minimal media used was NCE (22Berkowitz D. Hushon J. Whitfield Jr., H. Roth J. Ames B. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 215-220Google Scholar, 23Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol.

Luria-Bertani (LB) was the rich medium used (Difco) (24Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). MacConkey and aldehyde indicator media were supplemented with 1,2-propanediol and CN-B12 and prepared as described previously (20Johnson C.L.V.J. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). ATR assays were also performed as reported previously (20Johnson C.L.V.J. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Google Scholar). Transductional crosses were performed as described previously (26Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar). In preparing lysates of galEmutant strains, overnight cultures were grown on LB medium supplemented with 0.2% galactose and 0.2% glucose with the addition of appropriate antibiotics. A P22 HT105/1 int-201 phage was used for transductional crosses at a concentration of 2 × 108phage/ml (27Schmieger H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1971; 110: 378-381Google Scholar). Uni-ZAP XR bovine and human liver cDNA libraries were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Titering, amplification, and mass excision of the cDNA carried on pBlueScript SK(+/−) were done according to the manufacturer's protocol except that the titering procedure used F-top agar with 0.2 mm thymine, but no NaCl (24Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), instead of NZY top agar. Following mass excision, the cDNA expression plasmids were purified using a QIAprep spin mini prep kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Then a portion of the resulting expression library was used to transform Salmonella entericastrain BE253 by electroporation. Strain BE253 is ATR-deficient due topduO and cobA mutations and carries pSJS1240 which provides rare tRNAs that enhance expression of heterologous genes in S. enterica. Following electroporation, transformation mixtures were suspended in molten aldehyde indicator medium that had been supplemented with 1,2-propanediol, HO-B12, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin and cooled to 45 °C. The molten medium was poured into 100 × 15-mm sterile Petri dishes, allowed to solidify, and incubated at 37 °C in the dark for ∼12 h. Resultant colonies were screened for red/brown color formation. This procedure allowed screening of about 5,000 transformants per plate. PCR was used to amplify the bovine ATR coding sequence. Plasmid pNL121, isolated in this study from a bovine library cDNA library, provided the template DNA. The primers used for amplification of the full-length coding sequence were 5′-GCCGCCGGTACCGATGACGACGACAAGTTCGGCACGAGCCCGGGAGGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCCGCCAAGCTTGCTTGGTTCCTCGATGAAGCA-3′ (reverse). To eliminate the predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), forward primer 5′-GCCGCCGGTACCGATGACGACGACAAGCCCCAGGGCGTGGAAGACGGG-3′ was used in conjunction with the reverse primer described above. These primers introduced KpnI and HindIII restriction sites into the PCR products and were designed such that following cloning the bovine ATR coding sequence would be fused to both N-terminal glutathione S-transferase and His6tags. PCR products obtained using the primers described above were restricted with KpnI and HindIII and ligated to the pET-41a expression vector (Novagen, Cambridge, MA) that had been similarly digested (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Ligation mixtures were used to transformEscherichia coli DH5α by electroporation, and transformants were selected by plating on LB-Kan medium. Pure cultures were prepared from selected transformants, and plasmid DNA isolated from these strains was analyzed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. Clones having the expected DNA sequences were transformed into E. coli strain BL21DE3 RIL (Stratagene) for high level expression. The human ATR coding sequence was cloned via PCR using a strategy similar to that described above for the bovine enzyme. IMAGE cDNA clone 2822202 provided the template DNA (Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, CA). For amplification of the full-length coding sequence, the following primers were used: forward 5′-GCCGCCAGATCTGGATGACGACGACAAGATGGCTGTGTGCGGCCTGG-3′ and reverse 5′-GCCGCCAAGCTTTCAGAGTCCCTCAGACTCGGCCG-3′. To eliminate the putative MTS, primer 5′-GCCGCCAGATCTGGATGACGACGACAAGCCTCAGGGCGTGGAAGACGGG-3′ was used as the forward primer. The primers described above introducedBglII and HindIII restriction sites that were used for cloning into the pET-41a expression vector. TheBglII site was positioned such that the resulting clones would express the human ATRs as fusion proteins with N-terminal glutathione S-transferase and His6 tags. Ligation, transformation, and analysis of clones was performed as described above for the bovine expression clones. Clones with the expected DNA sequence were transformed into E. coli strain BL21DE3 RIL for high level expression. For complementation studies, the human ATR coding sequence was amplified by PCR and cloned into plasmid pLAC22 which allows IPTG-inducible expression in S. enterica (28Warren J.W. Walker J.R. Roth J.R. Altman E. Plasmid. 2000; 44: 138-151Google Scholar). The primers used for amplification were forward 5′-GCCGCCAGATCTTATGCCTCAGGGCGTGGAAGACGGG-3′ and reverse 5′-GCCGCCAGCTTTCAGAGTCCCTCAGACTCGGCCG-3′. These primers eliminate the putative MTS and provide the needed ATG start triplet such that the first five amino acids of the expressed protein would be MPQGV (Fig.2). The PCR product was restricted with BamHI andHindIII and ligated into pLAC22 that had been digested withBglII and HindIII. Ligation mixtures were used to transform S. enterica strain BE253 (ATR-deficient) by electroporation. Transformants were selected on aldehyde indicator medium supplemented with 1,2-propanediol and Amp. Use of this medium allowed the identification of clones expressing ATR activity. Pure cultures were prepared from selected transformants, and plasmid DNA isolated from these strains was analyzed by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. Clones having the expected DNA sequences were moved into strain BE266 (pduO cobA) via P22 transduction. Pure cultures prepared from the resultant colonies, and determined to be phage-free by cross-streaking against P22 H5, were used for complementation studies. The E. coli strains used for expression of the bovine and human ATRs were grown on LB supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C with shaking at 275 rpm in a New Brunswick Scientific shaker incubator. Cells were grown to an absorbance of 0.6–0.8 at 600 nm, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm IPTG. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 275 rpm for an additional 3 h. Cells were removed from the incubator, held on ice for 10 min, and then harvested by centrifugation at 6,690 × g max for 10 min using a Beckman JLA-10.500 rotor. The cells were resuspended in 3 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7, and broken using a French pressure cell (SLM Aminco, Urbana, IL) at 20,000 psi. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the cell extract to a concentration of 100 μg/ml to inhibit proteases. The crude cell extract was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm (31,000 ×g max) for 30 min using a Beckman JA20 rotor to separate the soluble and insoluble fractions. The supernatant was decanted (soluble fraction), and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7 (inclusion body fraction). Both fractions were used for the ATR assays. Cells to be used as inocula for growth curves were grown overnight at 37 °C in 2 ml of LB medium or LB medium supplemented with ampicillin at 100 μg/ml for strains carrying pLAC22. A portion of the LB culture (1.5 ml) was pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of minimal medium. Then resuspended cells (125 μl) were used as the inoculum. Cells were grown in 16 × 150-mm culture tubes containing 5 ml of minimal media and incubated at 37 °C in a New Brunswick model C-24 water bath with a shaking speed of 250 rpm. Cell growth was determined by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm using a Milton Roy model Spectronic 20D+ spectrophotometer. Human skin fibroblasts from one normal individual (MCH45) and three patients diagnosed with cobalamin b (cblB) disorder (WG1680, WG1879, and WG2127) were obtained from the Repository for Mutant Human Cell Strains at Montreal Children's Hospital. These cell lines were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with Earle's salts,l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.2 μg/ml HO-B12 and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2, 95% air mixture. For lysate preparation, each of the cell lines was cultured in 3, T150-cm2 tissue culture flasks and grown to confluence. Harvested fibroblasts were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.6% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Insoluble cellular matter was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Protein concentration of the soluble extract was determined using a Micro BCA assay (Pierce). Cell extracts (220 μg of protein) were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a Hybond-P, polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with rocking in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 3% mouse serum. The primary antibody used was affinity-purified rabbit IgG anti-human-ATR diluted 1:1000. The secondary antibody was monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG (γ-chain specific) biotin conjugate (Sigma) and was used at a 1:25,000 dilution. All membrane incubations were carried out at room temperature for 1 h with rocking in TBST. The membrane was prepared for detection using streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:10,000, and Immun-StarTM horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescent kit (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's protocol. Membranes were exposed to x-ray film from Research Products International (Mt. Prospect, IL). DNA sequencing was carried out by University of Florida, Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research, DNA Sequencing Core facility and University of Florida, Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, DNA Sequencing Facility as described previously (29Bobik T.A. Havemann G.D. Busch R.J. Williams D.S. Aldrich J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5967-5975Google Scholar). Sequence similarity searches were carried out using the Blast family of sequence analysis software (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar, 31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were done with ClustalX using default parameters except as noted below (32Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Google Scholar). The slow and accurate method was used for pairwise alignments with a gap opening and extension penalties of 35 and 0.75, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment parameters were gap opening and extension penalties of 15 and 0.3, respectively, and delay divergent sequences was set at 25%. Our previous studies (20Johnson C.L.V.J. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Google Scholar) showed that S. enterica strain BE253 forms red/brown colonies on aldehyde indicator medium supplemented with 1,2-propanediol and CN-B12 when it is transformed with an ATR expression plasmid. The basis of the color formation is that ATR activity restores the ability of strain BE253 to convert CN-B12 to Ado-B12, the required cofactor for DDH. Given Ado-B12, DDH converts 1,2-propanediol to propionaldehyde which reacts with components in the aldehyde indicator medium to form a red/brown precipitate (20Johnson C.L.V.J. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Google Scholar). Hence, we expected that BE253 would be useful for screening expression libraries for ATR activity. Accordingly, we attempted to identify a human ATR cDNA by transforming strain BE253 with a human liver cDNA expression library and screening the resultant colonies for red/brown color formation on aldehyde indicator medium. Approximately 250,000 human cDNAs were screened, but no red/brown colonies were found. Subsequently, a bovine liver cDNA library was similarly screened, and four positive clones were isolated. The DNA sequences of two of the four clones were determined and found to be identical. The clone was 1058 bp in length and included a poly(A) tail indicating that its 3′ end was complete. However, analyses indicated that the 5′ end of the clone was incomplete. The clone included a 228-amino acid open reading frame that would be expressed as an N-terminal β-galactosidase fusion protein (as was expected given the cloning method employed), but it lacked the expected ATG triplet. Hence, the bovine clone apparently lacked a portion of its 5′ end. After the DNA sequence of the bovine cDNA clones was determined, Blastp searches of the NCBI nonredundant data base were conducted, and these searches showed that the 228-amino acid protein encoded by the bovine cDNA clone was 29% identical (Expect = 8 × 10−15) to the N-terminal domain (165 amino acids) of the PduO ATR of S. enterica (20Johnson C.L.V.J. Pechonick E. Park S.D. Havemann G.D. Leal N.A. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1577-1584Google Scholar). The findings that the bovine cDNA isolated both complemented an ATR-deficient mutant of S. enterica and encoded a protein with sequence similarity to a known ATR enzyme suggested that the bovine clone also encoded an ATR enzyme. Blastp searches showed that the putative bovine ATR enzyme was 88% identical to a human protein encoded by IMAGE cDNA clone 2822202 (accession number BC005054). The human cDNA clone was 1128 bp in length and included an appropriate ATG triplet and a poly(A) tail indicating that it was a full-length clone. Further sequence analyses showed that the predicted protein encoded by the human cDNA was 250 amino acids in length and was homologous over its entire length to the putative bovine ATR except that it included 19 additional N-terminal amino acids (Fig.2). This suggested that the bovine clone was nearly full length, lacking only a portion of its N terminus, probably a small region of its MTS (see below). Perhaps more importantly, however, the high identity between the human and bovine sequences indicated that both encoded proteins with similar functions. Furthermore, sequence similarity searches showed human cDNABC005054 encoded a protein with 26% amino acid identity to the PduO ATR of S. enterica. Thus, these results tentatively identified sequence BC005054 as the human ATR cDNA Subsequent sequence analyses showed human cDNA BC005054 was 99% identical to nine regions of human chromosome XII. The IMAGE cloneBC005054 encoded a protein with 2 amino acid substitutions compared with the putati"
https://openalex.org/W2100281765,"Ectopic calcification is commonly associated with cardiovascular disease, injury, aging, and biomaterial implantation. We hypothesized that the normal mechanical environment of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) inhibits a phenotypic switch to a pattern of gene expression more typical for bone and inducive for calcification. This hypothesis was tested using a 3-D engineered smooth muscle tissue model subjected to cyclic mechanical strain. This simplified model maintained a 3-D tissue architecture while eliminating systemic effects as can be seen with in vivo models. All engineered tissues were found to express bone-associated genes (osteopontin, matrix gla protein, alkaline phosphatase, and the transcription factor CBFA-1). Strikingly, however, expression of these genes was down-regulated in tissues exposed to cyclic strain at all time points ranging from 5 to 150 days. Furthermore, long-term strain played a protective role in regard to calcification, as unstrained tissues exhibited increased calcium deposition with respect to strained tissues. The results of this study suggest that without an appropriate mechanical environment, SMCs in 3-D culture undergo a phenotypic conversion to an osteoblast-like pattern of gene expression. This finding has significant implications for the mechanisms underlying a variety of cardiovascular diseases and indicates the broad utility of engineered tissue models in basic biology studies."
https://openalex.org/W1988079689,"In electrically excitable cells, membrane depolarization opens voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels eliciting Ca2+influx, which plays an important role for the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). However, we do not know whether Ca2+ influx alone can activate PKC. The present study was conducted to investigate the Ca2+ influx-induced activation mechanisms for two classes of PKC, conventional PKC (cPKC; PKCα) and novel PKC (nPKC; PKCθ), in insulin-secreting cells. We have demonstrated simultaneous translocation of both DsRed-tagged PKCα to the plasma membrane and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate to the cytosol as a dual marker of PKC activity in response to depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx in the DsRed-tagged PKCα and GFP-tagged myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate co-expressing cells. The result indicates that Ca2+ influx can generate diacylglycerol (DAG), because cPKC is activated by Ca2+ and DAG. We showed this in three different ways by demonstrating: 1) Ca2+ influx-induced translocation of GFP-tagged C1 domain of PKCγ, 2) Ca2+influx-induced translocation of GFP-tagged pleckstrin homology domain, and 3) Ca2+ influx-induced translocation of GFP-tagged PKCθ, as a marker of DAG production and/or nPKC activity. Thus, Ca2+ influx alone via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels can generate DAG, thereby activating cPKC and nPKC, whose activation is structurally independent of Ca2+.

Science. 1986; 233: 853-859Google Scholar), PKC has been one of the most extensively studied enzymes in eukaryotic cells. We now know that PKC plays a pivotal role in a myriad of cellular functions. Ten isoforms of PKC have been identified so far and have been classified into three categories based on structural differences in the regulatory domain: conventional PKC (cPKC; PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ), novel PKC (nPKC; PKCδ, PKCε, PKCη, and PKCθ), and atypical PKC (PKCζ and PKCλ) (2Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Google Scholar,3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar). The C1 and C2 regions in the regulatory domain are responsible for diacylglycerol (DAG) and Ca2+ binding, respectively. DAG comes mainly from plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis. This is caused by phospholipase C (PLC) activation, following agonist binding to a G protein-coupled receptor. In excitable cells, cytosolic Ca2+ signals are generated either by Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) and/or by Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors upon binding of IP3, the other product of PIP2 hydrolysis (4Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Google Scholar, 5Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Google Scholar). DAG and Ca2+activate the first family of cPKCs that have both the C1 and C2 regions. The second family of the novel PKCs is also activated by DAG, but in a Ca2+-independent manner because of the absence of the functional C2 region. The third family of the atypical PKCs can be activated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 in a Ca2+-independent manner (6Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Google Scholar). We focused this study on PKCα and PKCθ as representatives of cPKC and nPKC, respectively, to probe further into the mechanisms underlying the Ca2+ signaling-induced activation of cPKC and nPKC. To this end, we employed INS-1 cells, an insulin-secreting cell line established from a rat insulinoma (7Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Google Scholar), as a model system in which VDCCs are the main pathways for the generation of Ca2+ signals. Key observations from other laboratories have shown that PKCα is activated within the physiological Ca2+ concentration range in the presence of both DAG and phosphatidylserine (8Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Kikkawa U. Mori T. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 1218-1224Google Scholar) and that depolarizing K+ concentrations evoke an increase in the IP3 concentration in rat pancreatic islets, suggesting PLC-mediated production of DAG (9Biden T.J. Prentki M. Irvine R.F. Berridge M.J. Wollheim C.B. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 467-473Google Scholar). Two important questions arise: 1) Can depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx through the opening of VDCCs activate cPKC? and 2) Can Ca2+ influx also activate nPKC, if the Ca2+ influx results in production of DAG? Furthermore, in INS-1 cells, as in normal insulin-secreting cells, glucose-induced oscillations in membrane potential elicit repetitive openings of VDCCs (10Petersen O.H. Findlay I. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1054-1116Google Scholar). This is responsible for oscillations in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which causes pulsatile insulin secretion (11Bergsten P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E796-E800Google Scholar). Ca2+ oscillations play an essential role in exocytotic secretion in neuroendocrine cells (12Smith C. Moser T. Xu T. Neher E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1243-1253Google Scholar). It is therefore important to know how depolarization-evoked Ca2+oscillations are decoded into long term physiological modifications, such as insulin secretion, through PKC activation. Recent advances in the use of green fluorescent protein (GFP) has allowed us to investigate PKC activity in intact living cells by monitoring translocation of GFP-tagged PKC (13Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Google Scholar, 14Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Google Scholar). Inactive PKCs are located in the cytosol. Upon activation, following PIP2hydrolysis, they translocate from the cytosol to other cellular locations, such as the plasma membrane. By simultaneously measuring the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and the translocation of GFP-PKCγ in astrocytes, it has been shown that there is a marked temporal correlation between glutamate-elicited Ca2+ spikes and PKC translocation (15Codazzi F. Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1089-1097Google Scholar). A current model for activation of cPKC (14Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Google Scholar) proposes that: 1) the [Ca2+]i elevation recruits cPKC to the plasma membrane via the C2 region, 2) the site on the enzyme where the pseudosubstrate inhibitory region in the regulatory domain is occupied at rest is exposed and becomes available for substrate binding, and (3Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar) full activation of the enzyme takes place when DAG tightly tethers the enzyme to the plasma membrane via the C1 region. The sequence of these events suggests that translocation and activation of cPKC may not always correspond. This raises a final question: How do we know when the pseudosubstrate inhibitory region is removed (i.e. when exactly does activation of cPKC take place)? To address these questions, we monitored translocation of PKCα-GFP, as markers for cPKC, in response to depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx through VDCCs in INS-1 cells. The Ca2+ influx resulted in translocation of PKCα-GFP to the plasma membrane. We also assessed the phosphorylation state of the PKC substrate myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) (16Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Google Scholar) as another marker of PKC activity, by monitoring translocation of GFP-tagged MARCKS (MARCKS-GFP) with DsRed-tagged PKCα (PKCα-DsRed). When phosphorylated by PKC, MARCKS translocates from the plasma membrane to the cytosol (17Ohmori S. Sakai N. Shirai Y. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Shimizu N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26449-26457Google Scholar). Translocation of MARCKS-GFP to the cytosol took place as soon as PKCα-DsRed translocated to the plasma membrane upon stimulation of Ca2+ influx. These results indicate that the Ca2+ influx can generate DAG, because cPKC is activated by Ca2+ and DAG. We showed this in three different ways by demonstrating: 1) Ca2+ influx-induced translocation of GFP-tagged C1 domain of PKCγ, 2) Ca2+influx-induced translocation of GFP tagged pleckstrin homology domain (GFP-PHD), and 3) Ca2+ influx-induced translocation of PKCθ-GFP as a marker of DAG production. The depolarization-evoked increase in DAG concentration was estimated from in situcalibration to be 1.90 ± 0.02 μm. We have demonstrated for the first time that depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx can generate DAG, thereby activating cPKC and nPKC. We also observed that MARCKS remained phosphorylated through PKC activation as long as the depolarization-evoked Ca2+oscillations continued. Our results show that short-lived Ca2+ signals can be transduced via PKC activation into long term phosphorylated MARCKS. PKCα-pEGFP, PKCθ-pEGFP, pEGFP-N2, and pDsRed1-N1 were obtained from Clontech Lab, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). To attain brighter fluorescence of MARCKS-GFP, the GFP of MARCKS-GFP (17Ohmori S. Sakai N. Shirai Y. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Shimizu N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26449-26457Google Scholar) was replaced with pEGFP-N2. pEGFP of PKCα-pEGFP was replaced with pDsRed1-N1. A GFP-tagged C1 region of PKCγ (C12-GFP) was produced from a DNA clone of λCKRγ1, which was subcloned into an expression plasmid for mammalian cells, pTB701 (18Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Nishizuka Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5199-5200Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment of PKCγ for C1 region with an EcoRI site in the 5′ terminus and a BglII in the 3′ terminus was produced by PCR using pTB701 as a template. The sense and antisense primers used were 5′-TTGAATTCGCCATGGTGAAGAGCCACAAGTTCACC-3′ and 5′-TTAGATCTGTCCACGCCGCAAAGGGAGGG-3′, respectively. A PCR product for C1 region of PKCγ was subcloned into the EcoRI site and theBglII site in GFP containing pTB701 (18Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Nishizuka Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5199-5200Google Scholar). The PCR product was verified by sequencing. A GFP-tagged pleckstrin homology domain of PLCδ1 (GFP-PHD) was donated by Dr. Hirose (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan) (19Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Google Scholar). INS-1 cells (7Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Google Scholar), insulin-producing cells, were a gift from Dr. Sekine (Tokyo University).The cells were grown in 100-mm culture dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. The culture medium was RPMI 1640 with 10 mm glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm mercaptoethanol. For fluorescence imaging, the cells were cultivated on a coverslip at 50% confluency 2 days before transfection. A plasmid of the GFP- or DsRed-tagged proteins was transfected into the cells by lipofection using TransITTM-LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI). The experiments were performed 2 days after transient transfection. The standard extracellular solution contained 140 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 3 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3). The solutions for membrane depolarization contained 105 mm NaCl, 40 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 3 mm glucose, and 10 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.3) or contained 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 3 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3). In some experiments, CaCl2 was not included (Ca2+-free solution). The cells, placed on a glass coverslip attached to an open perifusion chamber, were continuously perifused from a gravity-fed system. The experiments were performed in the standard extracellular solution at room temperature, unless otherwise stated. Fura2/AM, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 1,2-dioctyl-sn-glycerol (DiC8) was purchased from Sigma. U73122 was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The fluorescence images were captured using a Olympus inverted microscope (60×, water immersion objective, and 60×) equipped with a cooled (−50 °C) coupled charge device digital camera (ORCA-II and ORCA-ER; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) and recorded and analyzed on a Aquacosmos imaging station (Hamamatsu Photonics). The excitation light source was 150 W xenon lamp with a Polychrome I monochromator (T.I.L.L. Photonics GmbH., Planegg, Germany). GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm for high time resolution of GFP-tagged PKCs digital imaging. We measured the fluorescence intensity of the GFP (DsRed)-tagged proteins (PKCs, MARCKS, PHD, and C1 domain) in the cytosol of the cell, excluding the nucleus, and/or at the plasma membrane, as a marker of translocation. These values (F) were normalized to each initial value (F 0), so that the relative fluorescence change was referred to as the “ratioF/F 0.” For simultaneous measurements of the relative change in fluorescence intensity of the GFP-tagged PKCs in the cytosol and [Ca2+]i, GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm, whereas Fura2 was excited at wavelengths alternating between 340 and 380 nm. We put a short pass filter of 330–495 nm to reduce background fluorescence in the light pass between a dichroic mirror of 505 nm and an emission filter of 535/45 nm band pass. The cells transiently expressing GFP-tagged PKCs were loaded with 2 μm Fura2/AM in the standard extracellular solution for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice and used within 2 h. The Fura2 ratio was calibrated using exposure to 10 μm ionomycin and 10 mmCa2+ or 10 mm EGTA in the Fura2-loaded cells without transfection of the GFP-tagged PKCs. A dissociation constant of 150 nm for Ca2+ and Fura2 at room temperature was used. For simultaneous measurement of relative fluorescence change in intensity of MARCKS-GFP and PKCα-DsRed using a dual band for fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC, GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm, whereas PKCα-DsRed fluorescence was excited at 558 nm. To reduce cross-talk between them, an emission filter wheel was used, and alternate emission filters of 535/45-nm band pass and 605/50-nm long pass were synchronously set with excitation filters for GFP and DsRed. To obtain high signal-to-noise ratio over the conventional epifluorescence microscopy (see supplemental figure), we installed a TIRFM unit (Olympus) into the same imaging system mentioned above. The incidental light was introduced from the objective lens for TIRFM (Olympus NA = 1.45, 60×). GFP and Fura Red were excited by a 488-nm laser, and each emitted light was collected through 535/45 and 645/75 nm, respectively. For simultaneous measurement of relative fluorescence change in intensity of C12-GFP and [Ca2+]i in the Fura Red-loaded cells, we used a W-view Optics (Hamamatsu Photonics), a branching optics that splits the incident light into using a Dichroic mirror of 550 nm, so that two separate images of the GFP and Fura Red fluorescence can be produced. We first examined the distribution of PKCα-GFP with the help of high time resolution digital imaging. Fig.1 A shows the rapid and reversible translocation of PKCα-GFP in response to a depolarizing K+ concentration (40 mm), which evoked Ca2+ influx through opening of VDCCs. The relative changes in the fluorescence intensities of PKCα-GFP in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane are plotted in Fig. 1 B, as a function of time. PKCα-GFP translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, and this can be seen by the reciprocal changes in the two parameters (Fig. 1 B) (n = 6). Thus, either parameter can be used as a marker of PKCα-GFP plasma membrane translocation. We chose to employ the relative fluorescence change in the cytosol as a marker of translocation. Next, we simultaneously measured [Ca2+]i and PKCα translocation in Fura2-loaded and PKCα-GFP-expressing INS-1 cells. As seen in Fig. 1 C, a depolarizing K+ concentration induced a transient translocation of PKCα-GFP to the plasma membrane following a transient [Ca2+]i elevation (n = 8). Thus, the temporal profile was similar to that observed when PKCα-GFP measurements were carried out alone, suggesting successful dissection of Ca2+ and GFP signals. We loaded INS-1 cells with Fura2, without expressing PKCα-GFP, to accurately estimate [Ca2+]i. In the standard extracellular solution containing 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 3 mmglucose, more than 50% of the Fura2-loaded INS-1 cells displayed spontaneous cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations (20Scheenen W.J. Wollheim C.B. Pozzan T. Fasolato C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19002-19008Google Scholar). The peak [Ca2+]i was no more than 400 nm. When the same cells were depolarized by the K+ channel blocker tetraetheylammonium (TEA) (20 mm), the Ca2+oscillations became more pronounced (21Eberhardson M. Grapengiesser E. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 355-360Google Scholar), and the peak [Ca2+]i was in the range of 600–800 nm (Fig. 2 A) (n = 10). To avoid cross-talk between Ca2+and GFP signals, exactly the same protocol as in Fig. 2 A was applied to PKCα-GFP-expressing cells without Fura2 loading. No translocation of PKCα-GFP took place in the standard extracellular solution, whereas oscillatory translocations of PKCα-GFP started immediately after introduction of the TEA-containing solution (Fig.2 B) (n = 5), suggesting a threshold value of [Ca2+]i of more than 400 nm for PKCα translocation. The temporal profile of the TEA-evoked PKCα-GFP translocations (Fig. 2, C and D) (n = 5) was similar to that observed in response to the membrane depolarization evoked by a high K+ concentration (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 3 Ashows that upon removal of external Ca2+, the TEA-induced Ca2+ oscillations and the PKCα-GFP translocations were abolished (n = 5), indicating that both are totally dependent on Ca2+ influx. We then tested whether PKCα can be fully activated in the presence of DAG at physiological Ca2+ concentrations. Using PKCα-GFP translocation to the plasma membrane as a marker of activation, short exposure to a combination of TEA and the diacylglycerol analogue DiC8(100 μm) induced sustained PKCα activation, despite the fact that [Ca2+]i quickly returned to the steady resting level upon removal of the stimulation (Fig. 3 B) (n = 8). This suggests that even a single TEA-evoked Ca2+ spike (within the physiological Ca2+concentration range) can fully activate PKCα in the presence of a sufficient amount of DAG (8Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Kikkawa U. Mori T. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 1218-1224Google Scholar). To compare the effects of Ca2+ influx and IP3-mediated Ca2+ mobilization on PKCα-GFP translocation, we tested, in the same cells, the actions of TEA and acetylcholine (ACh) (using a supramaximal concentration (100 μm), which might produce sufficient DAG to activate PKCα (see Figs. 7 B and 9 A)). As shown in Fig.4 A, the TEA-evoked translocation of PKCα-GFP was much more substantial than that induced by ACh, although the bulk [Ca2+]i elevations produced by the two agents were nearly equal (n = 11). For more accurate evaluation of the cytosolic Ca2+elevation caused specifically by IP3-induced store release, we removed the Ca2+ influx component due to capacitative Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane (22Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Google Scholar, 23Petersen O.H. Tepikin A. Park M.K. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 271-276Google Scholar). This was simply done by removing external Ca2+ during stimulation with ACh (100 μm) (Fig. 4 B). The result was similar (n = 5) to that shown in Fig. 4 A, suggesting that there was little effect of store-operated Ca2+ influx on PKCα translocation. Reversing the sequence of events (applying TEA first and then subsequently ACh) gave similar results to those shown in Fig. 4 (data not shown).Figure 9Depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx and ACh induce C12-GFP translocation. Shown are simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+]i and C12-GFP translocation in Fura Red-loaded and C12-GFP expressing INS-1 cells using TIRFM. The ratio represents the relative fluorescence change in intensity of C12-GFP at the plasma membrane and of [Ca2+]i. Note that rises in Ca2+ are reported as a fall in fluorescence. The region of interest for both parameters was at the plasma membrane (white box inC). A, the entire time course of simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+]i and C12-GFP translocation.

Simultaneous monitoring of the translocation of PKCα-GFP and [Ca2+]i in Fura2-loaded cells with expression of PKCα-GFP is shown. A, a supramaximal concentration of ACh (100 μm) induced a small translocation of PKCα-GFP, whereas TEA-evoked depolarization induced a marked PKCα-GFP translocation, although the magnitude of the [Ca2+]i elevation induced by ACh was virtually the same as that elicited by TEA and lasted longer. B, the same concentration of ACh (100 μm) in the absence of external Ca2+ also induced a very small translocation. It should be noted that the third TEA-evoked translocation was much larger than the second ACh-elicited translocation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) One line of evidence has shown that [Ca2+]i elevations drive translocation of cPKC to the plasma membrane (13Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Google Scholar, 14Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Google Scholar). However, we do not know whether cPKC can be activated by depolarization-evoked Ca2+influx alone. To answer this question, we employed a GFP-tagged MARCKS as another marker of PKC activity (17Ohmori S. Sakai N. Shirai Y. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Shimizu N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26449-26457Google Scholar), which is a putative and direct substrate for PKC (16Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Google Scholar), as well as PKCα-DsRed. We co-transfected both of them into INS-1 cells. When activated PKC phosphorylates the plasma membrane-anchored MARCKS, then phosphorylated MARCKS translocates from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. Thus, simultaneous monitoring of PKCα-DsRed and MARCKS-GFP allows us to test whether depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx can activate cPKC. Fig.5 (A and B) shows translocations of MARCKS-GFP and PKCα-DsRed induced by TEA, indicating that depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx can activate PKCα. Phosphorylated MARCKS only slowly and gradually returned to the plasma membrane (∼2.5 min) in contrast to the rapid temporal profile of PKCα translocation (∼30 s) (Fig. 5 B) (n = 6). Ca2+ oscillation-driven translocations of PKCα kept MARCKS phosphorylated in the cytosol until termination of the repetitive PKCα translocations (Fig.5 C) (n = 8). As seen in Fig. 5 (A andB), we now know that depolarization-evoked Ca2+influx can activate PKCα. This observation prompted us to explore whether depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx can generate DAG, because Ca2+ and DAG are required for activation of cPKC (2Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Google Scholar). It has been shown that K+-induced membrane depolarization increases IP3 production in insulin-secreting rat pancreatic islets (9Biden T.J. Prentki M. Irvine R.F. Berridge M.J. Wollheim C.B. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 467-473Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that there should be production of DAG in response to depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx. To test this hypothesis, we employed PKCθ-GFP as a marker of nPKC activity as well as DAG production because nPKC is activated by DAG alone in a Ca2+-independent manner (2Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Google Scholar). TPA caused a rapid and sustained translocation of PKCθ-GFP in the complete absence of Ca2+ influx (Fig. 6,A and B) (n = 6). The simultaneous measurements of PKCθ-GFP translocation and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, shown in Fig. 6 C, confirm that extracellular Ca2+ is not required for PKCθ-GFP translocation (n = 4). We then applied a depolarizing K+ concentration to PKCθ-GFP-expressing cells. Fig.7 A clearly shows that this stimulus induced a gradual translocation of PKCθ-GFP to the plasma membrane, which was reversible upon removal of the high K+solution (n = 12). The amplitude of the translocation induced by K+-induced depolarization was comparable with that elicited by ACh (Fig. 7 B). It should be noted that ACh still continued to induce translocation of PKCθ-GFP after [Ca2+]i had returned to the resting level, verifying that 100 μm ACh generated enough DAG to sustain the translocation until termination of the stimulus (n= 8) (Figs. 7 B and 9 B). The amplitude of the TEA-evoked translocation was also comparable with that induced by ACh, and the translocation was not synchronous with the TEA-evoked Ca2+ spikes (Fig. 7 C) (n = 8). To fully corroborate the above evidence that the Ca2+ influx generates DAG and activates PKCθ, we performed further experiments using GFP-PHD and C12-GFP. First, GFP-PHD allows us to visualize IP3 production by translocating from the plasma membrane to the cytosol because of the 20-fold higher affinity for IP3 than for PIP2(19Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Google Scholar), such that we can assess indirectly the simultaneous production of DAG upon PIP2 hydrolysis by a Ca2+-dependent PLC activation. As shown in Fig.8 A, depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx resulted in the relatively transient translocation of PHD-GFP, whereas the translocation was sustained during ACh stimulation (n = 11), indicating DAG production. Second, to directly monitor the plasma membrane DAG levels, we also employed translocation of the C12-GFP as a DAG sensor (14Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Google Scholar, 15Codazzi F. Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1089-1097Google Scholar) using TIRFM. This has a ∼10-fold higher signal-to-noise ratio (see “Experimental Procedures”) than conventional epifluorescence microscopy in terms of the fluorescent protein translocation near the plasma membrane (for example PKC-GFPs) (15Codazzi F. Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1089-1097Google Scholar). We loaded the C12-GFP-expressing cells with Fura Red to define the relationship between the [Ca2+]ichange and DAG production in response to the Ca2+ influx. Depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx clearly translocated C12-GFP to the membrane (Fig.9 A) after [Ca2+]i had risen to the peak (Fig.9 B), in contrast to the sustained ACh-induced translocation of C12-GFP following the transient [Ca2+]i elevation. Stimulation with 40 mm K+ also resulted in a C12translocation of an undiminished magnitude in 5 μmthapsigargin-pretreated C12-GFP-expressing cells, indicating little contribution of either Ca2+- or IP3-induced Ca2+ release to the C12translocation (data not shown). As long as both high K+ and ACh stimulation continue"

Calorie restriction has been shown to have neuroprotective effects, but the mechanisms in vivo are unknown. We investigated apoptosis and apoptotic regulatory proteins in the brain frontal cortex of 12-month-old ad libitum fed, 26-month-old ad libitum fed, and 26-month-old calorie-restricted (CR) male Fischer 344 rats (CR = 40% restricted compared to ad libitum). We found that specific DNA fragmentation indicative of apoptosis was increased with age (+124%) in the cortices of the brain and that calorie restriction attenuated this increase significantly (-36%). We determined levels of ARC (apoptosis repressor with a caspase recruitment domain), which inhibits caspase-2 activity and also attenuates cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. We found a significant age-associated decline in ARC level, which was attenuated in the brains of the CR rats. In accordance with the changes in ARC expression observed, calorie restriction attenuated the increases in cytosolic cytochrome c and caspase-2 activity with age and suppressed the age-associated rise in cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3. However, neither age nor calorie restriction had any effect on caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities. This data provides evidence for an increased incidence of apoptosis in rat brain with age and evidence that calorie restriction has the ability to attenuate this. Furthermore, our data suggest that calorie restriction provides neuroprotection through ARC by suppressing cytochrome c release and caspase-2 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2007311293,"Ferrocene, a stable, synthetic, iron-containing compound induces in vitro and in vivo activation of mouse lymphocytes and macrophages. Ferrocene also has a marked antitumor effect in mice, upon its administration intraperitoneally and in drinking water. Ferrocene's antitumor activity is attributed to its immune-stimulatory property. This conclusion is supported by adoptive transfer experiments demonstrating that immune cells from ferrocene-treated tumor-bearing mice elicit an antitumor effect in mice not treated with ferrocene. We postulate that the immune stimulatory effect of ferrocene is mediated by redox-sensitive signaling such as activation of p21ras. This postulation is supported by the following findings: Ferrocene generates H2O2 by autooxidation; N-acetylcysteine, a free-radical scavenger, reduces its antitumor effect; and it stimulates GTPase activity catalyzed by pure recombinant p21ras and activates ERK 1/2 in wild Jurkat T cells but fails to do so in the Jurkat T cells expressing p21ras in which cysteine 118 was replaced by serine. Lastly, ferrocene activates and translocates NF-kappaB in human PBM, a pathway which is mediated by ras. It is most plausible that additional redox-sensitive signaling proteins mediate the biological effects of ferrocene."
https://openalex.org/W2142560484,"Blockade of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) by cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibits apoptosis in various cell types. However, use of CsA in humans is associated with damage to the arterial endothelium. We evaluated whether inhibition of the apoptotic machinery by CsA promotes other forms of cell death in arterial endothelial cells (EC). Exposure of human umbilical artery EC (HUAEC) to clinically relevant concentrations of CsA for up to 24 h was associated with a significant increase in necrotic features. We detected inhibition of apoptosis and a significant increase in necrosis in HUAEC exposed concomitantly to CsA and mitomycin C, a proapoptotic DNA damaging agent. We found that CsA-induced cell death is independent of caspase activation, p53 induction, and calcineurin inhibition. However, bongkrekic acid, another mPTP blocker, also increased necrosis in HUAEC. Dihydroethidium and acridine orange staining revealed increased intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) followed by lysosomal damage in HUAEC exposed to CsA. Hydroxyl radical and superoxide scavengers and inhibition of cathepsin D activity significantly attenuated CsA-induced EC death. These results suggest that inhibition of the apoptotic machinery by CsA in arterial EC favors development of a necrotic form of cell death regulated by ROS and secondary lysosomal damage."

A hydroxamate inhibitor GM6001 and rabbit polyclonal antibodies AB815 against the hinge region of MT1-MMP were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). α1-Antitrypsin was obtained fromCalbiochem. The recombinant version of the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (MT1-MMP-CAT) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified from inclusion bodies, and refolded as described previously (26Ratnikov B. Deryugina E. Leng J. Marchenko G. Dembrow D. Strongin A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 149-155Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment coding for peptide Ala21–Ser538 of the full-length MT1-MMP (the GenBankTM accession number U41078) was merged with the His6 tag and placed in the pPIC9 plasmid (Invitrogen) under control of the alcohol oxidase promoter and α-mating factor pre-propeptide. The resulting construct encoding the soluble, secretory MT1-MMP without both the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail (MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT) was used to transform P. pastoris GS115 spheroplasts using Pichia expression kit (Invitrogen). The clones were grown and selected according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The expression of MT1-MMP was examined in conditioned media samples by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using AB815 antibody. The most efficient clone, which produced about 5 mg of total MT1-MMP per 1 liter of conditioned medium, was used for further analysis. To produce MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT, P. pastoris transformant cells were grown in 1 liter of BMGY medium containing 1% glycerol (Invitrogen) for 2 days at 30 °C. Next, the cells were collected and resuspended in 200 ml of BMMY medium containing 0.5% methanol. After 24 h, the cells were removed by centrifugation. The medium was used to purify MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT by ammonium sulfate precipitation (80% saturation) followed by FPLC of the precipitated material aliquots on a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mmTris, pH 8.0. After extensive washing to remove the impurities, MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT was eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the presence of the MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT species. The fractions containing the proenzyme and the enzyme were pooled and used for further analysis. To isolate sufficient quantities of MT1-MMP, we synthesized in methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris the recombinant soluble MT1-MMP (MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT) with both the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains deleted (Fig. 1 A). The expression of the α-factor-His6-MT1-MMP construct in the pPIC9 plasmid was controlled by the alcohol oxidase promoter. The presence of the α-factor sequence stimulated secretion of MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT from cells into the extracellular medium. Following the induction of the alcohol oxidase promoter, MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT was efficiently expressed by yeast cells and secreted in medium. In the first 24 h following the gene induction, MT1-MMP was predominantly represented by the proenzyme and mature enzyme forms (Fig.1 B, inset, left lane). Further cultivation of cells negatively affected MT1-MMP and predominantly yielded its degraded forms (data not shown). Consequently, FPLC on a MonoQ column was employed to isolate the purified proenzyme and enzyme forms of MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT from a 1-day medium (Fig. 1 B,inset, the middle and right lanes, respectively). The enzyme of MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT demonstrated high proteolytic activity in the cleavage of the peptide fluorescence substrates, gelatin zymography, and in initiating the activation of the MMP-2 zymogen. These activities of MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT were comparable with those of MT1-MMP-CAT derived from E. coli. Thus, specific activity against fluorescence peptide substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 where Mca is 7-methoxycoumarin, and Dpa is 3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)diaminopropionic acid (Bachem, Torrance, CA) of MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT and MT1-MMP-CAT was 20 and 60 arbitrary units/nm, respectively. Similarly, the catalytic quantities of the MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT enzyme were capable of efficiently cleaving α1-antitrypsin, a protein substrate susceptible to MMPs, including MMP-2 and MT1-MMP (11Rozanov D.V. Ghebrehiwet B. Postnova T.I. Eichinger A. Deryugina E.I. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9318-9325Google Scholar), thereby confirming the proteolytic potency of the purified construct. The purified proenzyme of MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT was inert in cleaving α1-antitrypsin. A wide range hydroxamate inhibitor of MMP activity, GM6001 (1 μm), fully inhibited the cleavage reaction (Fig. 1 C, right panel). The purified MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT proenzyme samples were relatively unstable. When incubated at 45–50 μg/ml for 1–4 h at 37 °C, pro-MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT readily generated the several distinct molecular forms of the enzyme. The conversion of the proenzyme to the enzyme was fully blocked by co-incubation of the samples with GM6001 (1 μm) (Fig. 2 A). Serine proteinase inhibitors failed to affect MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT (data not shown). To investigate further the autolytic pathway that generates multiple molecular forms of MT1-MMP frequently observed in cancer cells, we concentrated the purified sample of the individual MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT proenzyme and incubated the concentrated material at 0.45–0.5 mg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C. Extensive self-proteolysis of MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT generated six prominent proteolytic fragments that were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to N-terminal microsequencing (Fig. 2 B). The results are summarized in Fig. 1 A. Thus, microsequencing confirmed the expected N-terminal sequence of the MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT construct (RFPSI which represent the N-terminal sequence of the yeast α-factor). Self-activation of MT1-MMP then generated the mature enzyme commencing from Tyr112. It is likely that this form was further processed to the intermediate with the N terminus at Trp119. The next autolytic cleavage produced the form with the N terminus at Asn130. MT1-MMP with the N terminus at Trp119 also missed the C-terminal portion of the molecule, thereby generating the species with the lower than expected molecular weight. Further cleavages generate the functionally inert forms of MT1-MMP lacking the catalytic domain. These three forms commencing from Thr222, Gly284, and Thr299 correspond to the inactive ectodomain membrane-tethered forms of MT1-MMP frequently found in cancer cells. Thus, the similar forms of MT1-MMP were observed in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells transfected with the full-length MT1-MMP gene and, therefore, overexpressing MT1-MMP at the cell surface. The co-incubation of carcinoma cells with GM6001 (50 μm) for 48 h blocked the self-proteolysis of MT1-MMP and promoted accumulation of the proenzyme and the enzyme in the cells (Fig.3). Our findings suggest that the proenzyme of MT1-MMP-ΔTM/CT is susceptible to autocatalytic activation. Similarly, pulse-chase experiments in furin-deficient LoVo colon carcinoma cells (27Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Kasai K. Banno T. Duguay S.J. Van de Ven W.J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26565-26569Google Scholar) overexpressing MT1-MMP clearly demonstrated that MT1-MMP was activated in this cell type and confirmed the presence of two molecular species of the MT1-MMP enzyme on cell surfaces. 2E.

In these studies, insufficient amounts of MT1-MMP in tumor cells greatly complicated an extensive and unambiguous structural analysis. Our data, however, indicate that the MT1-MMP in its autolytic pathway cleaves the catalytic domain at QQLY↓GG284 rather than at QQLYG↓G284as earlier reported by Fridman and co-workers (22Toth M. Hernandez-Barrantes S. Osenkowski P. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Shimura Y. Meroueh O. Kotra L.P. Galvez B.G. Arroyo A.G. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26340-26350Google Scholar). Fridman and co-workers (22Toth M. Hernandez-Barrantes S. Osenkowski P. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Shimura Y. Meroueh O. Kotra L.P. Galvez B.G. Arroyo A.G. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26340-26350Google Scholar) have also directly suggested that the cleavage at the SDPSA↓I256 site requires the attachment of MT1-MMP to the plasma membrane. In agreement, the cleavage at the SDPSA↓I256 site was not identified in our samples of soluble MT1-MMP. The observations reported here suggest that MT1-MMP is a proprotein self-convertase capable of autocatalytically cleaving its prodomain at the furin cleavage site RRKR↓Y112 and generating the mature enzyme with N terminus at Tyr112. These data reinforce our earlier observations (28Rozanov D.V. Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko G.N. Quigley J.P. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25705-25714Google Scholar, 29Ratnikov B.I. Rozanov D.V. Postnova T.I. Baciu P.G. Zhang H. DiScipio R.G. Chestukhina G.G. Smith J.W. Deryugina E.I. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7377-7385Google Scholar) that there are alternative pathways of MT1-MMP activation and maturation, such as furin-independent autocatalytic and furin-dependent pathways in cancer cells. Furthermore, our findings are also consistent with the earlier data that demonstrated that the full-length and soluble MT1-MMP constructs expressed in either the baculovirus (30Jo Y. Yeon J. Kim H.J. Lee S.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 511-519Google Scholar) system or in P. pastoris (31Roderfeld M. Buttner F.H. Bartnik E. Tschesche H. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 369-374Google Scholar) were found not to contain the prodomain and were largely represented by the active enzyme commencing from Tyr112. Furthermore, a unique substrate binding mode identified in our earlier work (32Kridel S.J. Sawai H. Ratnikov B.I. Chen E.I. Li W. Godzik A. Strongin A.Y. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23788-23793Google Scholar) discriminates MT1-MMP from other MMPs; the presence of either Arg at the P4 position or characteristic Pro at the P3 position of the substrate is essential for efficient hydrolysis and for selectivity for MT1-MMP. This unconventional feature is important to MT1-MMP biology because it explains the autocatalytic cleavage at the R4RKR↓Y112 cleavage site. It is tempting to hypothesize that in many cancer cell types and especially in furin-deficient cancer cells, such as LoVo colon carcinoma (27Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Kasai K. Banno T. Duguay S.J. Van de Ven W.J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26565-26569Google Scholar), MT1-MMP is a likely substitute for the general proprotein convertase activity of furin-like proteinases. Altogether, our findings provide a structural basis for understanding the unconventional regulation of MT1-MMP at cancer cell surfaces and stimulate highly focused mutagenesis for further elucidation of the structure-function relationship of MT1-MMP in normal and pathophysiological conditions."

GBP was predominantly expressed in neuronal cells among various brain tissues. GBP mRNA was already detected in the E12 brain and then gradually increased to reach a peak within P0–2 weeks after birth. GBP expression in the brain decreased age-dependently to ∼30% of the postnatal level at 12 months. GBP encoded 1021 amino acids and was predicted to have two transmembrane regions and glutamic acid- and proline-rich regions. Because the sequence of GBP offered few clues to the possible function, we performed a GST-tagged GBP pull-down assay in PC12 lysates and identified GRP78, one of the heat shock proteins, as a counterpart. Observation of COS7 cells expressing green fluorescent protein- or Myc-tagged GBP showed that GBP was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi domain where BODIPY 558/568 (4,4-difluro-5-(2-thienyl)-4-bora-3α,4α-diaza-S-indacene)-labeled brefeldin A accumulated. To investigate a biological role for GBP, we established Neuro2a cells stably expressing Myc-tagged GBP. Overexpression of GBP did not affect cell growth or morphological features but attenuated the time-dependent decrease in cell viability caused by serum deprivation compared with control cells. After 48 h of serum starvation, Neuro2a cells overexpressing GBP were resistant to the cell death induced by serum withdrawal. These results suggest that GBP would have a relevant functional role in embryonic and postnatal development of the brain.

The molecular mechanisms for the formation of structural and functional nervous systems are complex, and our knowledge is limited. Therefore, we consider that many as yet unidentified genes would contribute to the regulation of brain development at the embryonic and postnatal stages. In the present study, we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel gene enriched in the embryonic and postnatal stages of rat brain development. Our cloned gene encoded an ER1-Golgi localized protein that was associated with GRP78, one of the heat shock proteins. We suggest that our cloned GRP78-binding protein (GBP) plays a role in the functional development of neurons. The expressions of mRNAs in the hypothalamus, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, of postnatal rats (2 weeks after birth) and adult rats (10 weeks) were compared by PCR-selected cDNA subtraction according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech) (12Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA (0.5 μg) was extracted from the brains at each age, converted to double-stranded cDNA (ds cDNA) by incubation with reverse transcriptase, 5′-AAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCAGAGTACGCGGG-3′ (10 μm), and 5′-AAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCAGAGTACN−1N-3′ (10 μm). The ds cDNA was digested to blunt-ended fragments by treatment with RsaI, and only ds cDNA from 2 week-rats was ligated with oligonucleotides: 5′-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGCCGCCCGGGCAGGT-3′ (adapter1) or 5′-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCAGCGTGGTCGCGGCCGAGGT-3′ (adapter2R). For the 1st hybridization, each adapter-ligated cDNA was respectively hybridized with an excessive amount of cDNA from adult rats. Following the 2nd hybridization by combination with each 1st hybridized solution, 2-week-specific cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the 1st primer, 5′-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′, 2nd primer1, 5′-TCGAGCGGCCGCCCGGGCAGGT-3′, and 2nd primer2, 5′-AGCGTGGTCGCGGCCGAGGT-3′. The secondary PCR products were cloned using the T/A cloning system and sequenced on both strands using an ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with T7 and SP6 primers. To obtain the full-length cDNA of GBP, we produced 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE PCR products from rat forebrain RNA and sequenced them as described above. Neuro2a and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% calf serum. Transfection with each plasmid (2–6 μg) was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable cell lines transfected with each plasmid were selected and maintained by G418 (Clontech) at concentrations of 0.5–2.0 mg/ml. Total RNA (5–10 μg) from various rat tissues was purified, resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, and blotted onto nylon membranes. To investigate the expression of GBP mRNA in the various brain regions and in the whole brain at indicated ages, we purchased RNA-blotted membrane from Seegene Co. Ltd. An α-32P-radiolabeled rat GBP cDNA fragment containing nucleotides 2972–3248 was hybridized in the Clontech hybridization solution. After washing, the membranes were exposed to a Fuji imaging plate and analyzed with BAS2000 (Fuji Film, Japan). In order to control for the amount of RNA present, the membranes were stripped and re-hybridized with a G3PDH cDNA probe. RT-PCR was also performed to estimate the mRNA levels of various tissues and cell lines as described previously (13Oh-hashi K. Narusem Y. Tanaka M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 μg of total RNA was converted into cDNA by reverse transcriptase, and specific DNAs were amplified by PCR using Taq polymerase. The PCR primers used in this study were as follows: GBPsense primer, 5′-GGCTCCCAGTGCTTCAGAGA-3′; GBPantisense primer1, 5′-TCCAGGGGCCTGGAATCCGG-3′; GBP antisense primer2, 5′-GATCCTCTCCATGTAGTTCCGAA-3′; GBP antisense primer3, 5′-TGCAGTTCCACTACACAGGC-3′; G3PDH sense primer, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′; and G3PDH antisense primer, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′. The level of GBP mRNA in tissues and cell lines was detected using GBP sense primer and GBP antisense primer1 or -2, and T7 primer andGBP antisense primer3 were used to detect the level of Myc-tagged GBP mRNA in Neuro2a cells. The typical reaction conditions were 0.5 min at 95 °C, 0.5 min at 60 °C, and 1 min 72 °C. The results shown represent 18–30 cycles of amplification. After amplification, the cDNAs were separated by electrophoresis in 2.0% agarose gels and visualized using ethidium bromide. Antisense and sense RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription of an RT-PCR-amplified fragment of GBP cDNA (nucleotides 1122–3248) subcloned into pBSSK(+) and synthesized from these cDNA templates with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase and a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeling mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (14Tanaka M. Iijima N. Amaya F. Tamada Y. Ibata Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Postnatal (2-week) and adult (10-week) rat brains were perfused and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at 4 °C, and coronal sections (30 μm in thickness) were cut on a cryostat. The sections were treated with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma), 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and 10 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C, 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 5 min, and 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine for 10 min. The sections were then incubated in hybridization buffer containing a DIG-UTP-labeled GBP riboprobe for 12 h at 60 °C. Following the hybridization, the sections were washed sequentially in 2× SSC containing 50% formamide, RNase solution, and 0.4× SSC. Finally, they were processed for DIG-coloring steps using an anti-DIG antibody, 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as described previously (14Tanaka M. Iijima N. Amaya F. Tamada Y. Ibata Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected with the indicated plasmid as described above. For the detection of cells expressing Myc-tagged GBP, cells were fixed with PBS containing 4% formaldehyde for 15 min. After washing, the cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min and incubated with an anti-Myc antibody for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody. The ER and Golgi apparatus were visualized by staining with BODIPY 558/568-brefeldin A for 30 min just before fixation with PBS containing 4% formaldehyde (16Deng Y. Bennink J.R. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. Yewdell J.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In all cases, the cells were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and observed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Japan). PC12 cells in 10-cm dishes were preincubated with methionine-free medium for 60 min, and then 25 μCi of [35S]methionine was added. After 6 h of incubation, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The collected supernatants were rotated with the C-terminal region of GBP-fused GST- or GST-immobilized beads overnight at 4 °C (15Okabayashi Y. Sugimoto Y. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Kido Y. Sakaguchi K. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5265-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After extensive washing with lysis buffer, the proteins bound to each resin were eluted with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm GSH and separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. After drying, the gels were exposed to a Fuji imaging plate and analyzed with BAS2000. To extract and analyze the proteins bound to GST-fused GBP, SDS-PAGE gels were stained with Sypro Ruby (Molecular Probes) or Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the stained regions were digested in trypsin solution at 35 °C for 20 h for analysis by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (Aproscience, Japan). COS7 cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with pcDNA3.1/GBP-myc.his (Invitrogen) and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors) containing 1% Triton-X100 or Nonidet P-40 for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, the detergent-soluble fraction was collected. The detergent-resistant fraction was resuspended and sonicated in an equal amount of lysis buffer. An aliquot of each sample was mixed with an equal amount of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. Western blotting was performed as described previously using the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For co-immunoprecipitation, COS7 cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with pcDNA3.1/myc.his or pcDNA3.1/GBP-myc.his together with pflag-GRP78. 24 h after the transfection, the cells were dissolved in lysis buffer, and debris was discarded after centrifugation. Anti-Myc or anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) were added to the whole cell lysates and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Then 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads were added and rotated for a further 1 h. After washing the beads four times with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors, the beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by Western blotting. Each protein was detected with the anti-Myc antibody or anti-FLAG antibody, respectively. Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay as described previously (17Oh-hashi K. Maruyama W. Yi H. Takahashi T. Naoi M. Isobe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, each Neuro2a cell line stably transfected with Myc-tagged GBP or empty vector (3 × 104 cells/well) was cultured in the presence or absence of 10% fetal bovine serum for the indicated time, and the MTT solution was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. The cells were lysed with 0.04 m HCl in isopropyl alcohol, and the difference in absorbance between 595 and 655 nm was measured as an indicator of cell viability. To identify novel genes in the hypothalamus during postnatal brain development, the mRNA expressions in the forebrains of postnatal day (P) 14, and adult rats at 10 weeks were compared by PCR-selected differential screening because retinal axons grow into the hypothalamus (retinohypothalamic tract) during the postnatal stage, and this reaches a peak at around 2 weeks (18Takatsuji K. Oyamada H. Tohyama M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 84: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Klein D.C. Moor R.Y. Reppert S.M. Suprachiasmatic Nucleus: The Mind's Clock. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 391-418Google Scholar). We screened the partial sequence of a novel gene, which was expressed at a higher level in postnatal brain compared with adult brain. To obtain the full-length cDNA of this gene, we produced 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE PCR products from the rat forebrain RNA, and fused them together. The nucleotides and deduced amino acid sequence of this rat cDNA are shown in Fig. 1. According to a search with BLAST, this sequence was almost 90% identical to a mouse one (GenBankTM accession numberBC006896). A related sequence in human (GenBankTMaccession number AK023577) was partial and about 80% identical to rat GBP (nucleotides 1077–3066). The cDNA encoded 1021 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 110 kDa. A motif search of this protein with PROSITE predicted two transmembrane regions (amino acid residues (aa) 14–40 and 852–868), a proline-rich region (aa 739–780), and a glutamic acid-rich region (aa 809–831). In addition, several N-glycosylation, N-myristoylation, and phosphorylation sites were deduced (data not shown). Northern blotting and RT-PCR analysis were performed to examine the distribution ofGBP mRNA in tissues. As shown in Fig.2 A, enriched expression ofGBP mRNA was observed in the brain compared with other tissues. The expression in the lung was moderate, and weak signals were detected in the heart, liver, kidney, spleen, testis, and muscle. Within the brain, Northern blotting of total RNA isolated from different brain regions showed that GBP was expressed at higher levels in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum and at lower levels in the pons, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord (Fig.2 B). The temporal changes in the expression of GBP mRNA in the whole brain from the embryonic stage to the adult were examined (Fig. 3). The expression ofGBP was faintly detected at E12 and gradually increased until P0. After birth, the GBP level was almost maintained from E20.5 to 2 weeks, and then continuously declined until 12 months. Densitometric analysis of Northern blotting normalized byG3PDH mRNA intensity revealed that the expression ofGBP in the 12-month-old rat brain had decreased by about 70% compared with that in postnatal brain. To elucidate the expression pattern of GBPmRNA in embryonic, postnatal, and adult rat brain brains, we performed in situ hybridization histochemistry. The expression of GBP mRNA was observed predominantly in the gray matter, and the appearance and distribution of the GBP-expressing cells suggested that GBP mRNA was expressed in neurons but not in glial cells. GBP-expressing cells were detected in various regions of the rat forebrain, including the hypothalamus, and cells strongly expressing GBP were observed in the thalamus, cerebral cortex, amygdala, and cerebellum (Fig. 4). In agreement with the results of the Northern blotting, the expression of GBP mRNA in aged rat brain was ubiquitously decreased in comparison with that in postnatal developing brain. Next, we prepared Myc- and GFP-tagged GBP constructs, and we investigated the expression and intracellular localization in intact cells by immunoblotting and fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig.5, Myc-tagged GBP in COS7 cells was almost solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 or Nonidet P-40, and bands corresponding to a 170kDa protein were detected by immunoblotting. COS7 cells transfected with Myc-tagged GBP or GFP-tagged GBP showed similar localization of GBP (Fig. 5, A and C). Furthermore, we confirmed that GFP-tagged GBP in COS7 cells almost overlapped with the fluorescent probe (BODIPY)-labeled brefeldin A which specifically stains the ER and Golgi apparatus (Fig.5 C). To characterize further the localization of GBP, we constructed three deletion mutants, consisting of the N-terminal region (aa 1–411), the middle region (aa 375–817), and the C-terminal region (aa 666–1021) and established stable cell lines expressing full-length GBP or a mutant GBP. As shown in Fig. 6, only the C-terminal region of GBP among the three mutants had a unique cellular localization, and its pattern was similar to that of full-length GBP.Figure 6COS7 cells stably expressing GFP-tagged full-length, deletion mutants, and empty vectors were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Each GFP-GBP fusion protein corresponding to the indicated residues (A) was stably expressed in COS7 cells and observed by fluorescence microscopy (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the roles of our cloned gene, we used affinity methods to identify its binding proteins. An affinity matrix was prepared by immobilization of a GST-GBP (aa 606–913) fusion protein on glutathione-Sepharose beads, because the roles of this region were somewhat deduced by the observation of the COS7 cells transfected with the GFP-tagged GBP (aa 666–1021) plasmid as described above. A band corresponding to an ∼45-kDa protein was mainly detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, although this cDNA encoded 248 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of about 54 kDa (Fig.7 A). We considered that the GST-fused C-terminal region of GBP in Escherichia coli would be digested during the extraction and immobilization to the GSH-Sepharose beads. Incubation of [35S]methionine-labeled PC12 cell lysates with the immobilized GST-GBP-(606–1022) fusion protein resulted in the binding of several proteins (Fig. 7 B). Among these proteins, we identified two proteins with molecular masses of about 70 kDa from non-labeled PC12 cell lysates (see “Experimental Procedures”). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis of the fragments of the lower and upper bands and comparison with the sequences in the GenBankTM Data Bank revealed almost complete identity to rat Hsc73 and GRP78, respectively. To investigate the association with Hsc73 or GRP78 in intact cells, COS7 cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged GBP and FLAG-tagged Hcs73 or GRP78. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were lysed and anti-Myc antibody immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with an anti-FLAG antibody. Under these conditions, FLAG-tagged GRP78 was identified in the anti-Myc antibody immunoprecipitates (Fig.7 C). Therefore we named this novel gene,GRP78-binding protein (GBP). On the other hand, interaction with Myc-tagged GBP and FLAG-tagged Hsc73 was very weak (data not shown). No signals were detected in immunoprecipitates without the anti-Myc antibody or the lysates from empty vector-transfected cells. In order to investigate a biological role for GBP, we established four Neuro2a cell lines stably expressing Myc-tagged GBP or an empty vector. Two overexpressed cell lines markedly up-regulated the level of GBP mRNA, although Neuro2a cells did endogenously express some GBP (Fig.8 A). The band of Myc-tagged GBP in Neuro2a cells corresponded to about 135 kDa by immunoblotting, which was different from that in the COS7 cell lysates (Fig.8 B). Overexpression of GBP did not change the features or growth rate of Neuro2a cells. However, overexpression of GBP attenuated the time-dependent reduction in cell viability that was caused by serum deprivation (Fig. 8 C). After 48 h of serum starvation, both Neuro2a cell lines overexpressing GBP were more resistant to the cell death induced by serum starvation (Fig.8 D). In the present study, we isolated and characterized a novel GRP78-binding protein, GBP, in the rat brain. GBP was predicted to have two transmembrane regions, a proline-rich region and a glutamic acid-rich region, but the sequence offered few clues to the possible function. In order to identify regions likely to be functionally important, we observed the intracellular localization of full-length and deletion mutants of this gene in COS7 cells. We then found that GRP78, one of the heat shock proteins, was a GBP-binding protein by the GST pull-down assay method using the identified region of GBP. Our results suggest that the C-terminal region of GBP would have some function in the localization to the ER-Golgi region and interaction with GRP78, but the precise functional domain in GBP remains to be determined. The bands of GBP corresponding to about 135- and 170-kDa proteins in Neuro2a and COS7 lysates, respectively, were detected by immunoblotting although GBP encoded 1021 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 110 kDa. We consider that some sites in GBP would be individually modified by as yet unknown and different mechanisms in Neuro2a and COS7 cells because a motif search of GBP by PROSITE suggested that GBP contains several N-glycosylation,N-myristoylation, and phosphorylation sites. We demonstrated that GBP mRNA was predominantly expressed in the neurons, but not glial cells, of the rat brain, by Northern blotting, and in situ hybridization. GBP-expressing cells were widely detected in various regions of the rat brain such as the cortex, thalamus/hypothalamus, amygdala, and cerebellum. Interestingly, in the cerebellum, granule cells but not Purkinje cells expressed GBP mRNA (data not shown). GBPmRNA was already detected in the E12 brain, and it gradually increased to reach a peak within P0–2 weeks after birth. These observations indicate that GBP would play a role in the development of the embryonic and postnatal brain and the function of neuronal cells. Furthermore, the age-dependent decrease in GBP expression implies that GBP might affect neuronal susceptibility to various extra- and intracellular stresses to cause several neuronal disorders. GRP78 was originally identified because its expression is significantly increased in glucose-deprived cells. Similar to other heat shock proteins, such as Hsp40, Hsp70, and GRP98, GRP78 has been shown to be induced by a variety of stimuli, including an increase in intracellular calcium, oxidative stress, and ER stress (20Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar, 21Drummond I.A. Lee A.S. Resendez Jr., E. Steinhardt R.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). GRP78 has been reported to exist as an ER lumen protein and to act as a molecular chaperon that regulates protein folding and translocation into the ER and protein secretion, and ER disruption occurred when mutated GRP78 was overexpressed (23Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 24Liang P. MacRae T.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 431-1440PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hendershot L.M. Wei J.Y. Gaut J.R.

Brain Res. 1999; 72: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The localization of GBP in the ER-Golgi apparatus and its association with GRP78 in our experiments is consistent with the intracellular localization of GRP78. In the central nervous system, the levels of GRP78 are markedly induced in response to ischemia, axotomy, and kainate-induced seizures (27Wang S. Longo F.M. Chen J. Butman M. Graham S.H. Haglid K.G. Sharp F.R. Neurochem. Int. 1993; 23: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Moreno-Flores M.T. Olazabal U.E. Kreutzberg G.W. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of the GRP78 level by treatment with GRP78 antisense caused sensitivity to a variety insults such as glutamate, Fe2+, and amyloid β-peptide (29Yu Z. Luo H. Fu W. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 155: 302-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In particular, GRP78 has been suggested to suppress oxyradical accumulation and to stabilize mitochondrial functions in PC12 cells (29Yu Z. Luo H. Fu W. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 155: 302-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), but the precise mechanisms remain to be determined. Very recently, GRP78 has been reported to associate with ATF6 and caspase-7/12, respectively (22Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 30Rao R.V. Peel A. Logvinova A. del Rio G. Hermel E. Yokota T. Goldsmith P.C. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and suggested to regulate stress-related gene expression and apoptosis. Both ATF6 and caspases are anchored in the ER by binding to GRP78 under resting conditions, but some ER stresses cause cleavage of both proteins and translocation to the Golgi-nucleus and cytosol, respectively. In our preliminary experiments, the amount of FLAG-tagged GRP78 co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged GBP was hardly affected by treatment with thapsigargin, which causes ER stress by inhibiting ER Ca2+-ATPase, suggesting that the association of GRP78 and GBP is constitutive. On the other hand, the expression ofGBP mRNA in neuronal cell lines was hardly modulated by several stimuli that cause growth arrest and/or apoptosis (data not shown). The significance of GBP in vivo under pathological conditions remains to be determined although GBP might affect ER-Golgi-localized proteins, such as ATF-6 and caspase-7/12, by forming a complex with GRP78. Furthermore, we found that stable overexpression of GBP in Neuro2a cells suppressed serum deprivation-induced cell death, which is consistent with the anti-apoptotic feature of GRP78. Serum deprivation would disturb a variety of cellular signaling pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases and p53 cascades, to induce apoptosis. Because ATF-6 and caspase-12 are reported to be predominantly activated by ER stress reagents, we consider that GBP would attenuate other serum deprivation-induced cascades among several death signaling pathways in Neuro2a cells. In conclusion, we cloned a novel GRP78-binding protein (GBP), which is predominantly expressed in the rat brain and possesses an anti-apoptotic property, although it is not clear how overexpression of GBP in Neuro2a cells maintained cell viability after serum deprivation. Apoptotic cell death is accompanied by proliferation and differentiation of neurons and the formation of synapses at embryonic and postnatal stages. Neuronal dysfunction during aging and neuronal diseases is also associated with apoptotic cell death. Thus, further studies on the functions of GBP, including GRP78, would provide new insights to clarify not only the development and differentiation of neuronal cells at the embryonic and postnatal stages but also neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2101013185,"Impaired lymphatic drainage in human limbs causes the debilitating swelling termed lymphoedema. In mammals, known growth factors involved in the control of lymphangiogenesis (growth of new lymph vessels) are vascular endothelial growth factors-C and -D (VEGF-C/D). Here we characterize a model of lymphangiogenesis in which the tail of lizards is regenerated without becoming oedematous. Three weeks after the tail is shed (autotomy), there are a small number of large diameter lymphatic vessels in the regenerated tail. Thereafter, the number increases and the diameter decreases. A functional lymphatic network, as determined by lymphoscintigraphy, is established 6 wk after autotomy. The new network differs morphologically and functionally from that in original tails. This lymphatic regeneration is associated with an up-regulation of a reptilian homologue of the VEGF-C/D protein family (rVEGF-C/D), as determined by Western blot analysis using a human reactive VEGF-C polyclonal antibody. Regenerating lizard tails are potentially useful models for studying the molecular basis of lymphangiogenesis with a view to developing possible treatments for human lymphoedema."
https://openalex.org/W1994632778,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MID1 gene product, Mid1, is composed of 548 amino acid residues, has four relatively hydrophobic segments named H1–H4, and functions as a Ca2+-permeable, stretch-activated channel when expressed in mammalian cells. In some conditions Mid1 cooperates with Cch1, a yeast homolog of the α1 subunit of mammalian voltage-gated channels. To identify the important regions or amino acid residues necessary for Mid1 function, we employed in vitro site-directed mutagenesis on H3 and H4 of Mid1 and expressed the resulting mutant genes in a mid1 null mutant to examine whether the mutant gene products are functional or not in vivo. Mutant Mid1 proteins lacking the whole H3 or H4 segment, H3De or H4De, did not complement the lethality and low Ca2+ accumulation activity of the mid1 mutant, although their localization and contents appeared to be normal, indicating that H3 and H4 are required for Mid1 function itself. Single amino acid exchange experiments on individual amino acid residues of H3 and H4 showed that 10 of 20 residues in H3 and 14 of 23 residues in H4 were important for the normal function of Mid1. In particular, we found four severe loss-of-function mutations, D341E, F356S, C373D, and C373R, and two interesting mutations leading to a high level of Ca2+accumulation with a slightly low complementing activity, G342A and Y355A. The importance of these amino acid residues will be discussed.

The importance of these amino acid residues will be discussed. The MID1 gene product, Mid1, is anN-glycosylated, integral membrane protein required for viability of differentiated yeast cells and Ca2+ influx induced by the mating pheromone α-factor (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar). Cells lacking theMID1 gene die because of limited Ca2+ influx when incubated with α-factor. This phenotype is called themid phenotype for the mating pheromone-induced death phenotype. Electrophysiological and cell biological studies on Chinese hamster ovary cells, Balb/c 3T3 cells, and COS-7 cells expressing Mid1 have revealed that it functions as a Ca2+-permeable stretch-activated channel (2Kanzaki M. Nagasawa M. Kojima I. Sato C. Naruse K. Sokabe M. Iida H. Science. 1999; 285: 882-886Google Scholar, 3Kanzaki M. Nagasawa M. Kojima I. Sato C. Naruse K. Sokabe M. Iida H. Science. 2000; 288: 1347Google Scholar). The mating pheromone leads their target cells to differentiate into cells (so-called “shmoos”) having a mating projection at which the plasma membrane and the cell wall are degraded and regenerated (4Carnero E. Ribas J.C. Garcia B. Duran A. Sanchez Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 264: 173-183Google Scholar, 5Baba M. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. Kanaya K. Osumi M. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 207-216Google Scholar). Concomitantly with the formation of the mating projection, Mid1-dependent Ca2+ influx is stimulated (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar, 6Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10482-10486Google Scholar, 7Iida H. Yagawa Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13391-13399Google Scholar). Thus, Mid1 might function in sensing membrane stretch and generating Ca2+signals during the mating process. Although stretch-activated channels or mechanosensitive channels are known to play a critical role in touch sensation, hearing, balance, detecting gravity, and sensing osmotic changes, little is known about their molecular structures and biochemical properties. Genetic and cell biological studies have revealed that Mid1 coimmunoprecipitates and works with Cch1, a yeast homolog of the pore-forming α1 subunit of mammalian voltage-gated Ca2+channels (8Fischer M. Schnell N. Chattaway J. Davies P. Dixon G. Sanders D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 259-262Google Scholar, 9Paidhungat M. Garrett S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6339-6347Google Scholar, 10Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Google Scholar). The voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are heteromultimeric proteins consisting of α1, cytoplasmic β, and non-pore-forming transmembrane α2δ and γ subunits (11Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Google Scholar). These non-pore-forming subunits dramatically influence the properties and surface expression of the channels (12Chien A.J. Hosey M.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 377-386Google Scholar, 13Gao B. Sekido Y. Maximov A. Saad M. Forgacs E. Latif F. Wei M.H. Lerman M. Lee J.H. Perez-Reyes E. Bezprozvanny I. Minna J.D. J. Biol.

Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2886-2894Google Scholar). Although the channel activity of Cch1 has not yet been revealed experimentally and Mid1 has no homology to the auxiliary subunits, Mid1 has been shown to cooperate with Cch1 in mating pheromone-induced Ca2+ uptake (8Fischer M. Schnell N. Chattaway J. Davies P. Dixon G. Sanders D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 259-262Google Scholar, 9Paidhungat M. Garrett S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6339-6347Google Scholar,17Muller E.M. Locke E.G. Cunningham K.W. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1527-1538Google Scholar), store-operated or capacitative Ca2+ entry (10Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Google Scholar), endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced Ca2+ uptake (18Bonilla M. Nastase K.K. Cunningham K.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2343-2353Google Scholar), and a hyperosmotic stress-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+(19Matsumoto T.K. Ellsmore A.J. Cessna S.G. Low P.S. Pardo J.M. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33075-33080Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown recently that Mid1, but not Cch1, is required for an antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ mainly caused by Ca2+ influx (20Courchesne W.E. Ozturk S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 223-234Google Scholar). Mid1 is also involved in a hexose-induced, transient elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ (21Tokes-Fuzesi M. Bedwell D.M. Repa I. Sipos K. Sumegi B. Rab A. Miseta A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1299-1308Google Scholar). Therefore, Mid1 might function as an stretch-activated channel alone in some cellular situations and as a regulator of another channel composed of Cch1 in other cellular situations. This speculation remains to be proven at the molecular level. Although the physiological roles of Mid1 have been elucidated as described above, the structure-function relationship of this protein remains unclear. The Mid1 polypeptide is composed of 548 amino acid residues and could form a homotetramer (see supplemental material in Ref. 2Kanzaki M. Nagasawa M. Kojima I. Sato C. Naruse K. Sokabe M. Iida H. Science. 1999; 285: 882-886Google Scholar), having four hydrophobic segments, H1–H4 (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar) (see Fig.1). It is uncertain whether these segments are transmembrane domains. H1 is probably a signal peptide (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar). Computational analysis with the TMpred program (available at www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html) suggests that H3 and H4 are possible transmembrane helices. The hydrophobic profile of H3 is similar to that of the pore-forming regions of several cation channels (see supplemental material in Ref. 2Kanzaki M. Nagasawa M. Kojima I. Sato C. Naruse K. Sokabe M. Iida H. Science. 1999; 285: 882-886Google Scholar). H4 is partially homologous to the S3/H3 membrane-spanning domain of several ion channels (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar). Protease protection experiments on intact cells have revealed that Mid1 is present in the plasma membrane and that its C-terminal region is in the cytoplasm (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar). The C-terminal, cytoplasmic region downstream from H4, including the cysteine-rich regions, is essential for Mid1 function (22Maruoka T. Nagasoe Y. Inoue S. Mori Y. Goto J. Ikeda M. Iida H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11645-11652Google Scholar). In this study, to explore the structure-function relationship of H3 and H4, we mutated each one of all 20 and 23 amino acid residues in H3 and H4, respectively, and tested the effects of these single point mutants on Mid1 function by examining the ability of the mutant proteins to complement the mid phenotype and low Ca2+accumulation of the mid1 mutant. From these analyses, we identified several key amino acid residues and their clusters that potentially contribute to Ca2+ permeability. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Rich media and a synthetic medium, SD, were prepared as described previously (23Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Yeast nitrogen base was prepared according to the formula given in the Difco manual (24Difco Laboratories Difco Manual. 10th Ed. Difco Laboratories, Detroit1984: 1135-1141Google Scholar). Because SD medium contains 680.2 μm CaCl2 and 0.8 μm calcium pantothenate, in the Ca2+-deficient medium SD−Ca, CaCl2 was omitted, and calcium pantothenate was replaced with sodium pantothenate. SD.Ca100 medium was prepared by adding 100 μm CaCl2 to SD−Ca medium. Synthetic presporulation medium contained 6.7 g of yeast nitrogen base and 10 g of potassium acetate/liter. These media were supplemented with the appropriate nutrients as described previously (23Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Competent cells were prepared according to the methods described previously (25Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst .). 1990; 96: 23-28Google Scholar). Luria-Bertani medium and terrific broth were prepared as described previously (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). When required, ampicillin was added at 50 μg ml− 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescence protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase . To construct plasmids with theMID1 gene having deletion mutations or single mutations, site-directed mutagenesis was employed. The mutagenic primers were ordered from Invitrogen, and their DNA sequences are listed in Table II (supplemental data available at JBC on-line). PCR was performed withPfu polymerase (Stratagene) and YCpMID1-23 or YEpMID1-GFP1 (Table I) as a PCR template. The PCR Thermal Cycler MP (Takara) was used for PCR. The low copy plasmid YCpMID1-23 and its derivatives were used for measuring the viability of cells and Ca2+ accumulation and immunoblot analysis; the multicopy plasmid YEpMID1-GFP and its derivatives were used for detecting Mid1-GFP by confocal microscopy and immunoblot analysis. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing using an ABI Prism Automated Sequencing Kit and an ABI 310 Automated Sequencer (Applera Co., Applied Biosystems). Anymid1 null mutant producing no Mid1 polypeptide was not constructed by inserting a marker gene near the initiation codon of theMID1 gene because the 5′-coding region of theMID1 gene is necessary for the expression of the adjacent, essential gene RFC3 (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar). To construct a null mutant of theMID1 gene ( mid1-Δ5) by site-directed mutagenesis, EpMID1-Δ5 was prepared by introducing the stop codon TAA at Ile2 of the Mid1 protein coded for the plasmid EpMID1-31-P-HIS3-2 (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar) using a set of synthetic primers, 5′-GTATTATTTCTAAGGATGTAAGTGTGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCACACTTACATCCTTAGAAATAATAC-3′, where the underline indicates the stop codon and its anticodon, respectively. The resulting plasmid EpMID1-Δ5 was then used as a template to synthesize a DNA fragment containing the mid1-Δ5 gene by PCR using a set of synthetic primers, 5′-GATATAGTTTCGCTGCCATC-3′ and 5′-CGTATCGTCCAATGGATGAATTCACATCAAGGATGAGTTACC-3′. The DNA fragment was used to transform a wild-type strain, H207, to produce H311 bearing themid1-Δ5 mutation. Successful construction of the mid1-Δ5 allele was confirmed by PCR, DNA sequencing, and tetrad analysis. Immunoblot analysis confirmed further that the Mid1 protein was not produced from themid1-Δ5 allele at all. TheS. cerevisiae strain H311 was transformed by various plasmids whose selection marker was LEU2 (Table I) according to the method described previously (27Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The transformants were selected on agar plates containing SD medium supplemented with 20 μg/ml uracil and 20 μg/ml tryptophan at 30 °C for 3 days. To examine the activity of the mutant Mid1 proteins, the viability and Ca2+ accumulation of cells producing the proteins were measured by the methods described previously (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar). The mating pheromone α-factor was ordered from the Center for Analytical Instruments, National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan. The Mid1-GFP fusion proteins having mutations were expressed in the strain H311. Cells in the exponential phase in SD medium were harvested and placed on slide glasses covered with 1% poly-l-lysine hydrobromide. Subsequently, the slide glasses were sealed under a coverslip with nail polish. GFP images were observed using a confocal fluorescence microscope equipped with Nikon TE 300 (Nikon) in conjunction with Micro Radiance (Bio-Rad). We used Nikon Plan Apo 60x/1.40 Oil (Nikon) as an objective lens. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems). The methods of cell extract preparation were described previously (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar) and used with slight modifications. An improved immunoblotting technique was employed (28Wu M. Stockley P.G. Martin Jr., W.J. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 2373-2376Google Scholar). Cell extracts containing the Mid1 protein were applied on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the glutathioneS-transferase-Mid1 (GST-Mid1) fusion protein at a 1:2,000 dilution (22Maruoka T. Nagasoe Y. Inoue S. Mori Y. Goto J. Ikeda M. Iida H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11645-11652Google Scholar). Enolase was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against yeast enolase at a 1:5,000 dilution (29Iida H. Yahara I. Nature. 1985; 315: 688-690Google Scholar) and used for an internal marker for the amount of protein applied. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired Student's t test, with a maximum p value of < 0.05 required for significance. To determine whether H3 is essential for Mid1 function, a mutant Mid1 protein lacking the whole H3 segment from Ile337 to Phe356, H3De, was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the low copy plasmid YCpMID1-23 (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar) as a template and expressed in themid1-Δ5 mutant. The mutant expressing H3De, the H3De mutant, was incubated with α-factor for 8 h and examined for the viability of the cells. The result shows that the H3De mutant protein did not complement the mid phenotype of themid1-Δ5 mutant (Fig.2 A). Because themid1 mutations result in a low activity in mating pheromone-induced Ca2+ accumulation (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar), we measured Ca2+ accumulation in the H3De mutant exposed to α-factor for 2 h. Ca2+ accumulation in the H3De mutant was low, like that in the mid1-Δ5 mutant containing the vector pRS315 (Fig. 2 B). The result suggests that the H3 segment is required for Mid1 function. To identify important amino acid residues in H3, all 20 amino acid residues in this segment were mutated individually by site-directed mutagenesis with the following rules. All of the nonpolar amino acids were replaced by a polar amino acid, Ser, and the polar amino acids were replaced by a small, nonpolar amino acid, Ala. Gly is classified as a polar amino acid and was thus replaced by Ala. Because it has been reported that the negatively charged amino acids Glu and Asp in the transmembrane domain contribute to ion selectivity in voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (30Cibulsky S.M. Sather W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 349-362Google Scholar, 31Talavera K. Staes M. Janssens A. Klugbauer N. Droogmans G. Hofmann F. Nilius B. J. Biol.

Bernatchez G. Klein H. Garneau L. Sauve R. Parent L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C665-C672Google Scholar) and to interaction with channel blockers (34Li R.A. Ennis I.L. French R.J. Dudley Jr., S.C. Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11072-11077Google Scholar, 35Penzotti J.L. Lipkind G. Fozzard H.A. Dudley Jr., S.C. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 698-706Google Scholar), the remarkable Asp341 was replaced by each of 7 amino acids, Glu, Lys, Arg, Thr, Asn, Ala, and Leu, and the positively charged amino acid His353 was also replaced by each of 3 amino acids, Asp, Arg, and Ala. The mutant genes bearing these single amino acid substitutions were then introduced into cells of the mid1-Δ5 mutant, and the resulting transformants were examined for viability and Ca2+accumulation after exposure to α-factor. The results showed that the most notable Mid1 mutant protein was D341E, which had almost completely lost both the activity of complementing the mid phenotype and Ca2+ accumulation activity (Fig. 2). F356S also lost the complementing activity completely (Fig. 2 A) but still had Ca2+ accumulation activity near the wild-type level (Fig. 2B). G342A, I349S, V354S, and Y355A had slightly lower complementing activities than the wild-type protein, but two of which, G342A and Y355A, had greater Ca2+ accumulation activity than the wild-type protein, whereas the remainder had normal Ca2+ accumulation activity. In contrast, I337S, N339A, and D341A had slightly greater complementing activity than the wild-type protein, among which I337S had a significantly increased Ca2+ accumulation activity and the remainder had normal Ca2+ accumulation activity. The above observation that G342A and Y355A had a significantly lower complementing activity than the wild-type protein despite having a greater Ca2+accumulation activity suggests at least two possibilities. One is that overaccumulation of Ca2+ may lower the viability of cells. The other is that Mid1, as a regulator, might activate Cch1 and inactivate another factor responsible for cell viability. It is possible that some of the above mutations are dominant negative mutations rather than loss-of-function mutations. To test this possibility, the low copy plasmid containing severe mutations, such as H3De, D341E, or F356S, was introduced into wild-type cells, and the resulting transformants were examined for viability 8 h after the addition of α-factor. The results showed that the viabilities of these transformants were normal (data not shown), indicating that the mutations tested are recessive and loss-of-function ones. A mutant Mid1 protein lacking the whole H4 segment from Leu366 to Gly388, H4De, lost the activity of complementing themid phenotype as well as Ca2+ accumulation activity as did the H3De protein under the same conditions (Fig.3). To identify important amino acid residues in H4, all 23 amino acid residues in the segment were mutated individually by site-directed mutagenesis with the same rules as those in H3. Cys373 was replaced by each of 3 amino acids, Asp, Arg, and Ala, because Cys is a highly reactive amino acid residue. The results showed that the most marked mutant proteins were C373D and C373R (Fig. 3). The two proteins did not have either the complementing or Ca2+ accumulation activities at all. The 12 mutant proteins, F368S, L370S, D371E, F372S, D375E, A377S, Y378A, V380S, P381A, T382A, S383A, and G388A, had slightly lower complementing activity than the wild-type protein, although these proteins seemed to have essentially the same Ca2+ accumulation activity as the wild-type protein. In contrast, S384A had lower Ca2+accumulation activity, although it had essentially the same complementing activity as the wild-type protein. The three severe mutations, H4De, C373D, and C373R, had no dominant negative effects on the viabilities of wild-type cells (data not shown), indicating that these mutations are loss-of- function ones. The above results showing that the Mid1 proteins having a deletion of or a single mutation in H3 and H4 did not complement themid phenotype suggest that these segments and amino acid residues are required for Mid1 function. However, it is also possible that those results are caused by mislocalization of the mutant proteins. To examine this possibility, the Mid1 protein fused with GFP at the C terminus, Mid1-GFP, was used for observing the protein localization by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The Mid1 protein is an integral membrane protein and present at the plasma membrane (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the Mid1 protein localizes at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane as well as the plasma membrane, as revealed by indirect fluorescence microscopy. 2H. Yoshimura, S. Muto, and H. Iida, manuscript in preparation. The wild-type Mid1-GFP produced from low- and multi-copy plasmids has been shown to completely complement the mid phenotype and to localize at the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum membrane normally, 3C. Miyawaki, H. Iida, H. Tatsumi, and M. Sokabe, manuscript in preparation. indicating that GFP and the overexpression has no effect on the activity and localization of the Mid1 protein. However, it should be noted that fluorescence images of Mid1-GFP produced from the low copy plasmid were very faint and hard to be photographed.3 In addition, we have tried to examine the localization of the Mid1 protein produced from its gene on the intrinsic chromosome or on a low copy plasmid by indirect fluorescence microscopy using polyclonal anti-Mid1 antibodies, but we failed because of the very small expression levels of Mid1. We therefore examined the localization of Mid1-GFP produced from the multicopy plasmid thereafter. By using the gene encoding the wild-type Mid1-GFP on the multicopy plasmid, the deletions or single mutations that had produced the mutant phenotypes shown in Figs. 2 and 3 were introduced by exactly the same methods as those used for the gene encoding the Mid1 proteins. Figs.4 A and 5 A show that the wild-type Mid1-GFP localized on the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as expected, confirming the previous results, and Figs. 4 B and5 B show that GFP itself was present in the cytoplasm. Fluorescence images for the localization of all the mutant Mid1-GFPs tested were essentially the same as those of the wild-type Mid1-GFP (Figs. 4 and 5), suggesting that the phenotypes of the mutant Mid1 proteins presented in Figs. 2 and 3 were not caused by the mislocalization of the mutant Mid1 proteins.Figure 5Localization of the Mid1-GFP fusion proteins having a mutation in H4. Cells of mid1-Δ5were transformed with the multicopy plasmid encoding wild-type Mid1-GFP (A), GFP (B), H4De-GFP (C), F368S-GFP (D), L370S-GFP (E), D371E-GFP (F), F372S-GFP (G), C373D-GFP (H), C373R-GFP (I), D375E-GFP (J), A377S-GFP (K), Y378A-GFP (L), V380S-GFP (M), P381A-GFP (N) T382A-GFP (O), S383A-GFP (P), S384A-GFP (Q), and G388A-GFP (R). Exponentially growing cells of various strains grown in SD.Ca100 medium were harvested and observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Wild-type Mid1-GFP and GFP were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments, independently.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) There is another possibility that the above results shown in Figs. 2 and 3 were caused by a decrease in stability of the mutant Mid1 proteins. The contents of the mutant Mid1 proteins that have completely or partially lost the complementation activity were examined by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the GST-Mid1 protein. To perform this analysis, we employed a very recently developed, improved method of immunoblotting (28Wu M. Stockley P.G. Martin Jr., W.J. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 2373-2376Google Scholar) which enabled us to examine the level of the Mid1 proteins produced from the low copy plasmid used in the complementation analysis shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The results showed that the contents of the Mid1 proteins lacking the whole H3 or H4 region and having single mutations in H3 or H4 were essentially the same as those of the wild-type Mid1 protein (Fig.6), indicating that the above possibility is unlikely. We also confirmed that the mutant Mid1-GFPs described above were essentially the same level as the wild-type Mid1-GFP (data not shown), suggesting that the fusion of GFP to Mid1 and the expression of the fusants from the multicopy plasmid do not affect the stability of the mutant proteins tested. We have shown in this study that the H3 and H4 segments are necessary for Mid1 function. Deletion of either H3 or H4 resulted in a complete loss of function. In addition, we individually evaluated the amino acid residues in H3 and H4 required for the full activity of Mid1. Before discussing the importance of these amino acid residues, we will speculate about the structure of a putative Ca2+channel composed of Mid1. Our previous work has shown that Mid1 might form a homotetramer to make a channel (see supplemental material in Ref. 2Kanzaki M. Nagasawa M. Kojima I. Sato C. Naruse K. Sokabe M. Iida H. Science. 1999; 285: 882-886Google Scholar). In addition, Mid1 functions in an amiodarone-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+, whereas Cch1 does not (20Courchesne W.E. Ozturk S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 223-234Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that the phenotypes of mid1 andcch1 single mutants and a mid1 cch1 double mutant are essentially the same (10Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Google Scholar, 17Muller E.M. Locke E.G. Cunningham K.W. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1527-1538Google Scholar, 18Bonilla M. Nastase K.K. Cunningham K.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2343-2353Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that Mid1 coprecipitates with Cch1 (10Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Google Scholar), suggesting that Mid1 and Cch1 cooperate to work in some conditions. Two possible structure-function relationships could be hypothesized. One is that Mid1 might form a Ca2+ channel and serve a dual role as a stretch-activated channel mediating Ca2+ influx and as a stretch sensor, both of which might then generate a Ca2+signal or a conformational change to activate a coupled Ca2+ channel composed of Cch1. A mechanism analogous to this is well elucidated in the coupling between dihydropyridine receptors (the α1 subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+channels) and ryanodine receptors (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channels) in vertebrate skeletal muscles (36Catterall W.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 871-874Google Scholar,37Rios E. Pizarro G. Stefani E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 109-133Google Scholar). The other hypothesis is that Mid1 might form no channel by itself and instead be a regulatory subunit protein of a Ca2+channel whose pore-forming subunit is Cch1. It is known that mammalian voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have auxiliary subunits, α2δ, β, and γ, which regulate the activity of the pore-forming α1 subunit homologous to Cch1 (12Chien A.J. Hosey M.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 377-386Google Scholar, 13Gao B. Sekido Y. Maximov A. Saad M. Forgacs E. Latif F. Wei M.H. Lerman M. Lee J.H. Perez-Reyes E. Bezprozvanny I. Minna J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12237-12242Google Scholar, 14Green P.J. Warre R. Hayes P.D. McNaughton N.C. Medhurst A.D. Pangalos M. Duckworth D.M. Randall A.D. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 2001; 533: 467-478Google Scholar, 15Garcia R. Carrillo E. Rebolledo S. Garcia M.C. Sanchez J.A. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 2002; 545: 407-419Google Scholar, 16Hanlon M.R. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2886-2894Google Scholar). Because the structure of the putative Ca2+ channel(s) composed of Mid1 and Cch1 is an open question at present, we would like to explain the data presented in this paper from the viewpoint of both hypotheses. In particular, four severe loss-of-function mutations, D341E, F356S, C373D, and C373R, and two mutations leading to a high level of Ca2+ accumulation with a slightly low complementing activity, G342A and Y355A, are discussed below. When Asp341 in H3 was replaced with Glu, Lys, Arg, Thr, Asn, Ala, or Leu, only the D341E mutation resulted in an almost complete loss of function, regarding maintenance of cell viability and Ca2+ accumulation, whereas the other mutations did not deteriorate the function of Mid1 (Fig. 2). We examined three independent strains containing the D341E mutation and obtained the same results. In addition, we confirmed that the D341E mutant gene did not contain an additional mutation elsewhere in theMID1 gene. Therefore, these results suggest that the size of the residues is not important, but an appropriate strength of negative charge of this position may be. Glu has a greater negative charge than Asp (pKa 4.25 versus 3.86), and thus Ca2+ would bind to Glu341 too tightly to pass the channel, if Mid1 is the pore-forming subunit. It has been reported that Asp substitution in the EEEE locus, known as the filter of the L-type Ca2+ channel, reduces ion selectivity by weakening ion binding affinity (38Cloues R.K. Cibulsky S.M. Sather W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 569-586Google Scholar). In terms of the second hypothesis that Mid1 is a regulatory protein of a Ca2+ channel containing Cch1, Asp341 could be an important amino acid residue that may interact directly or indirectly with Cch1 and activate it. Coexpression study of the human auxiliary subunit α2δ with the α1 and β subunits has indicated that α2δ is required for an increase in the peak size of the N-type Ca2+ current (13Gao B. Sekido Y. Maximov A. Saad M. Forgacs E. Latif F. Wei M.H. Lerman M. Lee J.H. Perez-Reyes E. Bezprozvanny I. Minna J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12237-12242Google Scholar). Interestingly, although Mid1 has no sequential similarity to the α2δ subunit at all, both Mid1 and α2δ are glycosylated plasma membrane proteins (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar, 11Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Google Scholar, 39Gee N.S. Brown J.P. Dissanayake V.U. Offord J. Thurlow R. Woodruff G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5768-5776Google Scholar). Mid1 may directly up-regulate Cch1 like α2δ, and the loss-of-function mutation D341E may lead Mid1 not to activate Cch1. Cells of the G342A mutant have an interesting phenotype. They accumulate Ca2+ to a greater extent than wild-type cells and lose their viability (Fig. 2). One possibility is that the low viability is caused by much Ca2+ incorporated into this mutant. Because this mutation appeared not to affect the stability and localization of the G342A mutant protein (Figs. 4 and 6), the replacement of Gly342with Ala may be sufficient to cause a conformational change, either activating Mid1 itself or up-regulating Cch1 through the mutated Mid1. It has been suggested that a Gly residue and its adjacent amino acid residues in the gate play important roles in the gating mechanism in several ion channels. For example, the most conserved Gly22residue of E. coli MscL functions as the gate (40Batiza A.F. Rayment I. Kung C. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: R99-R103Google Scholar, 41Ou X. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Google Scholar). When Gly22 is replaced with hydrophilic residues, the resulting mutant MscL channels become more mechanosensitive. On the other hand, a Gly residue in a transmembrane segment can be also important for protein-protein interaction between two distinct membrane proteins. For example, Gly279, a central amino acid of the transmembrane segment 9 of Rh50 glycoprotein whose defect causes chronic hemolytic anemia and stomatocytosis, is important for the interaction with Rh30 protein in the plasma membrane of erythroid cell lineage (42Huang C.H. Liu Z. Cheng G. Chen Y. Blood. 1998; 92: 1776-1784Google Scholar, 43Hyland C.A. Cherif-Zahar B. Cowley N. Raynal V. Parkes J. Saul A. Cartron J.P. Blood. 1998; 91: 1458-1463Google Scholar). By analogy, Gly342 in H3 may contribute to the interaction of Mid1 with Cch1. Although the two alternative hypotheses remain to be examined, the G342A mutation in Mid1 provides a unique experimental system to investigate the property of Mid1 regarding Ca2+uptake. The F356S mutation brought about a unique phenotype. The F356S protein does not complement the lethality of themid1 mutant at all, but it still maintains the activity to accumulate Ca2+ close to a normal level (Fig. 2). It is, therefore, obvious that the death of the F356S mutant is not caused by a decrease in Ca2+ accumulation. It has been shown that the C-terminal region downstream from the H4 segment is located in the cytoplasm (1Iida H. Nakamura H. Ono T. Okumura M.S. Anraku Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8259-8271Google Scholar). In addition, our recent study with protease protection experiments has shown that GFP in the Mid1-GFP fusion protein, in which GFP has been fused downstream from H3, is susceptible to protease added to intact yeast cells.3 In contrast, GFP in the Mid1-GFP fusion protein, in which GFP has been fused downstream from H4, is resistant to protease as expected.3 These results suggest that H4 is a transmembrane segment and that Phe356 is outside the plasma membrane. Therefore, we speculate that Phe356 interacts with an extracellular portion of other protein(s) which takes part in the maintenance of cell viability without regulating Ca2+uptake. The F356S mutation would hardly affect the channel activity of Mid1 or the association of Mid1 with Cch1. In contrast, the Y355A mutation whose mutation site is neighboring to Phe356resulted in a slight increase in Ca2+ accumulation. Thus, the region containing Tyr355 and Phe356 may be an active portion required for interaction with both Cch1 and another component necessary for viability. In this study, 13 of 23 amino acid residues in H4 were found to be required for the maintenance of viability and 2 for Ca2+accumulation, but the degree of decreases in viability or Ca2+ accumulation was small for all of the mutants but Cys373 (Fig. 3). It is therefore unlikely that H4 contributes to the formation of the filter or the gate whose amino acid substitution is supposed to cause a large change in Ca2+permeability. Thus, a further study is to examine whether H4 is an inner or outer helix. If Mid1 is a regulatory subunit protein of Cch1 according to the second hypothesis, most of amino acid residues in H4 would not be required for the interaction with and activation of Cch1. The C373D and C373R proteins completely lost Mid1 function regarding the viability and Ca2+ accumulation, but the C373A protein functioned quite normally. This indicates that Cys373 does not contribute to disulfide bonding (Fig. 3). Probably, the negative or positive charge of C373D and C373R interferes with the interaction between Mid1 and Cch1 or a protein regulating Cch1. It is also possible that the charges result in a serious conformational change leading to the inactivation of Mid1 not to activate Cch1. In summary, using molecular genetic approaches, we have identified amino acid residues and clusters in the H3 and H4 segments important for Mid1 function. Especially, Asp341, Gly342, Tyr355, Phe356, and Cys373 have attracted a great deal of our attention. Further characterization of mutations in these amino acid residues should result in a better understanding of the molecular basis of the function of Mid1 as well as the structural and functional relationships between Mid1 and Cch1. In addition, because it remains to be elucidated how the pore-forming subunits of mammalian Ca2+ channels are regulated by non-pore-forming auxiliary transmembrane subunits, those studies would also shed light on the mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2022731320,"Helix-loop-helix (HLH) and helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (HLHZip) are dimerization domains that mediate selective pairing among members of a large transcription factor family involved in cell fate determination. To investigate the molecular rules underlying recognition specificity and to isolate molecules interfering with cell proliferation and differentiation control, we assembled two molecular repertoires obtained by directed randomization of the binding surface in these two domains. For this strategy we selected the Heb HLH and Max Zip regions as molecular scaffolds for the randomization process and displayed the two resulting molecular repertoires on λ phage capsids. By affinity selection, many domains were isolated that bound to the proteins Mad, Rox, MyoD, and Id2 with different levels of affinity. Although several residues along an extended surface within each domain appeared to contribute to dimerization, some key residues critically involved in molecular recognition could be identified. Furthermore, a number of charged residues appeared to act as switch points facilitating partner exchange. By successfully selecting ligands for four of four HLH or HLHZip proteins, we have shown that the repertoires assembled are rather general and possibly contain elements that bind with sufficient affinity to any natural HLH or HLHZip molecule. Thus they represent a valuable source of ligands that could be used as reagents for molecular dissection of functional regulatory pathways.

Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Google Scholar, 2Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Google Scholar, 3Baudino T.A. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 691-702Google Scholar). They are characterized by a highly conserved structural motif organized in a DNA binding sequence, the basic region, and a dimerization domain, either HLH (helix-loop-helix) or HLHZip (helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper). They associate in homo- and heterodimeric complexes that recognize E-box sequences (CANNTG) on DNA, recruit cofactors, and activate or repress transcription of many genes (1Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Google Scholar, 2Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Google Scholar, 3Baudino T.A. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 691-702Google Scholar). Selective dimerization is a regulatory mechanism that allows the expansion of their functional repertoire and also a fine tuning of gene expression by competition of different complexes able to bind the same DNA target sequences. The bHLHZip protein Max, constitutively expressed, is able to homodimerize as well as to heterodimerize with the other bHLHZip factors of the Max network (Myc, Mad1–4, Mnt/Rox), in which expression is regulated and which work only in association with Max (2Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Google Scholar, 3Baudino T.A. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 691-702Google Scholar). Myc, one of the most frequently altered genes in human cancer, induces proliferation, growth, and apoptosis but inhibits differentiation (2Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Google Scholar, 3Baudino T.A. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 691-702Google Scholar, 4Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3004-3016Google Scholar, 5Nasi S. Ciarapica R. Jucker R. Rosati J. Soucek L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 153-162Google Scholar). Mad and Mnt proteins, although possessing DNA binding specificities quite similar to Myc, have only partially overlapping, and frequently opposite, biological functions such as the ability to promote cell survival and differentiation. Similar to Max, among the factors lacking the Zip region, the omnipresent E-proteins (Heb, E47, E12, E2-2) also bind DNA as homodimers (1Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Google Scholar). The numerous tissue-specific bHLH proteins (MyoD, SCL/Tal, Mash, and many others) poorly homodimerize but require the association with E-proteins to bind DNA and exert their biological functions. HLH proteins lacking a basic region, such as the mammalian Id1–Id4, impose another level of regulation by sequestering E-proteins in dimers that are unable to bind to DNA (1Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Google Scholar). Understanding molecular recognition is a step toward a rational design of molecules that interfere with HLH protein function. In this regard, we showed that it is possible to inhibit Myc tumorigenic capacity by means of Omomyc, a mutant bHLHZip domain, obtained by changing four residues in the Myc Zip region (6Soucek L. Helmer-Citterich M. Sacco A. Jucker R. Cesareni G. Nasi S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2463-2472Google Scholar). Omomyc sequesters Myc in complexes unable to bind DNA, preventing transcriptional activation, enhancing repression, potentiating apoptosis (7Soucek L. Jucker R. Panacchia L. Ricordy R. Tato F. Nasi S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3507-3510Google Scholar), and suppressing Myc-induced papillomatosis. 2L. Soucek, S. Nasi, and G. Evan, submitted for publication. To gain insight into the rules of protein-protein recognition and to isolate mutant domains capable of functional interference, repertoires of HLH and HLHZip domains were designed, exposed on λ phage head, and screened by in vitro panning. Several domains that bound with different affinity to MyoD, Id2, Mad-1, and Rox were isolated; their comparison allowed us to elucidate the contribution of different amino acid residues to the stability and specificity of monomer-monomer interactions. These repertoires are a source of potential competitive inhibitors, useful for functional dissection and for drug design. DNA sequences encoding Max bHLHZip (Ala22 to Leu102) and repertoires of HLH and bHLHZip domains were PCR amplified and inserted into the λD4 vector DNA, between SpeI and NotI restriction sites at the 3′-end of a second copy of the D-gene (8Panni S. Dente L. Cesareni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21666-21674Google Scholar). pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) expression plasmids containing GST fusions to human Id2, mouse MyoD, human Max, baboon Mad (amino acids 36–221) and mouse Rox (amino acids 197–346) were introduced into BL21E. coli cells. Cells were grown at 37 °C to anA600 ∼ 0.5 and induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-ॆ-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C (MyoD, Id2) or at room temperature (Max, Mad, Rox). After lysis in the presence of 17 Triton X-100, fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by PAGE. A HLH domain repertoire was obtained by PCR amplification of the heb gene HLH domain sequence with two degenerate primers that containedSpeI and NotI sites: HLH-SpeI, 5′-GAACGCACTAGTGTGCGGGATVTTAATSWMGCATTSRAMRMSCTTRRGCGADTSDBTCAG-3′; HLH-NotI, 5′GTTCCTGCGGCCGCCTTGCTGTKSTAGACTAAGGATGWMTGCTWYGGCTTGATGAAGARTGAGGABTTTTGDTWGGGG-3′ (sequence symbols for degenerate oligonucleotides are:V = ACG, S = GC, W = AT, M = AC, R = AG, D = ATG, B = GCT, K = TG, Y= CT). The reactions, containing 100 ng of template DNA, 2 ॖm oligonucleotide primers, and 4.5 Pfupolymerase units, were cycled 35 times at two different annealing temperatures (45 and 52 °C). The resulting products were mixed to guarantee the highest level of variability. A bHLHZip repertoire was generated by two successive PCR amplifications on a max bHLHZip template. A leucine zipper (Zip) repertoire was obtained in the first reaction with the two degenerate primers: Lz, 5′-ACAGAGTATATCCAGTATATGSRAAGGVAMRASCACACACWCMDACAAVWMRWAGACGAC-3′; and Lz-NotI:5′-CAGTGAATTCCCGGGGCGGCCGCCCAGTGCACGAABTYKCTGCWBCAGAAGAGCSYKCYBCCGTYKGAG-3′. The Zip repertoire was used as 3′-primer for the second PCR reaction, whereas an oligonucleotide matching the max basic region (Max-SpeI, 5′-TGGGTACTAGTGCTGACAAACGGGCT-3′) served as 5′-primer, creating a bHLHZip repertoire with degenerate Zip regions linked to Max bHLH. Following hot start with Taqpolymerase (Sigma), the reaction was cycled 35 times (1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C) followed by a 7-min elongation step. DNA of both repertoires was digested with SpeI andNotI restriction enzymes and gel-purified. 20–30 ng of purified insert was ligated to 2 ॖg ofSpeI/NotI-digested λD4 vector DNA, purified by isopropanol precipitation. The ligation products were phenol/chloroform-extracted, isopropanol-precipitated, and in vitro packaged with a Gigapack III Gold kit (Stratagene). The libraries were amplified once by infection of Escherichia coli BB4 cells, plated onto LB-agarose plates, and grown for 6–8 h at 37 °C. Phage was eluted overnight at 4 °C with SM buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), precipitated with polyethylene glycol, and suspended at 1 × 1010 pfu/ml. Affinity selection of phage libraries was performed with GST fusion Id2, MyoD, Mad, and Rox proteins. Phage particles (1 × 109 pfu) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 10 ॖg of purified GST fusion protein, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and preincubated for 2 h in PBS, 37 bovine serum albumin. The beads were washed repeatedly in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.57 Tween 20 and suspended in 100 ॖl of SM buffer. Bound phage was recovered by infection of BB4 cells and plated onto 143-mm dishes. Phage was eluted with SM, titered, and subjected to two more biopanning rounds. Lysates were prepared from single phage plaques, concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation, and titered. 1 × 107 pfu from each phage stock were spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Nitroplus, Micron Separation Inc.), which was incubated at room temperature for 2 h in blocking buffer (PBS, 57 milk, 0.17 Nonidet P-40) and again for 2 h with 1 ॖg/ml GST target protein in the same buffer. After washing in PBS, 0.17 Triton, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-GST goat serum (Amersham Biosciences, 1:1000) and preadsorbed on bacterial lysate, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:10000), washed, and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, fromAmersham Biosciences). Multiwell plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 ॖl of anti-GST goat serum (5 ॖg/ml in PBS), washed in PBS, 0.057 Tween, and incubated in PBS, 0.057 Tween, 57 milk for 1 h at 37 °C. 0.5 ॖg of GST fusion protein was added to each well, for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, phage (108 pfu/well) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed with PBS, 0.057 Tween, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-λ phage rabbit IgG (1:1000, courtesy of R. Cortese, Istituto di Richerche di Biologia Moleculare, Pomezia (Rome)), and then incubated with HRP-conjugated protein A (1:10000, Sigma). Reactions were revealed by adding 100 ॖl/well tetramethylbenzidine solution (Promega), and the absorbance (A) values were recorded by an automated ELISA reader set at 450 nm. All assays were repeated at least three times. The reported values are in arbitrary units, calculated by normalization to the background interaction with GST and to the interaction of empty vector phage to GST, according to the following formula: [Aphage clone-GST fusion − (Avector-GST fusion − Avector-GST)]/Aphage clone-GST. Phage DNA inserts were PCR-amplified from 1 ॖl of phage lysate with two primers flanking theSpeI and NotI cloning sites: 5′-CACGTTCCGTTATGAGGATGT-3′ and 5′-ATGTATCAGTGCCTAGC-3′. The PCR products were purified from agarose gel using the ConcertTMRapid PCR Purification system (Invitrogen), and their sequences were determined with an ABI-3700 automated sequencer. Phage was lysed by boiling for 5 min in 2× SDS-gel sample buffer; proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-D-protein (1:1500, courtesy of R. Cortese) or anti-Max (Santa Cruz C-124; 1:5000) antibodies followed by HRP-protein A (1:10000) and developed with an Amersham Biosciences ECL kit. To identify the most appropriate vector for the display of HLH and HLHZip domain repertoires, we tested both filamentous phage vectors, successfully exploited for the construction of peptide or antibody repertoires (9Castagnoli L. Zucconi A. Quondam M. Rossi M. Vaccaro P. Panni S. Paoluzi S. Santonico E. Dente L. Cesareni G. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2001; 4: 121-133Google Scholar,10O'Connell D. Becerril B. Roy-Burman A. Daws M. Marks J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 49-56Google Scholar), and λ phage, reported to be generally more suitable for exposing large polypeptides (11Santini C. Brennan D. Mennuni C. Hoess R.H. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Luzzago A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 125-135Google Scholar, 12Santi E. Capone S. Mennuni C. Lahm A. Tramontano A. Luzzago A. Nicosia A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 497-508Google Scholar, 13Hoess R.H. Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2002; 3: 23-28Google Scholar). The DNA sequence encoding Max bHLHZip was cloned into the three filamentous phage vectors pC89, pC178, and pHENΔ, to obtain N-terminal fusions to pVIII or pIII coat proteins (14Felici F. Castagnoli L. Musacchio A. Jappelli R. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 301-310Google Scholar, 15Saggio I. Gloaguen I. Laufer R. Gene. 1995; 152: 35-39Google Scholar) and into the λ display vector 4 (λD4) to display fusions to the D-protein C terminus (8Panni S. Dente L. Cesareni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21666-21674Google Scholar, 16Cicchini C. Ansuini H. Amicone L. Alonzi T. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Tripodi M. Luzzago A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 697Google Scholar). We asked which vector would efficiently display Max bHLHZip and allow its binding to a natural dimerization partner, the GST fusion protein Mad (2Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Google Scholar). We found that only the λ vector particles were able to incorporate thed-Max chimeric capsid protein in an amount sufficient for immunological detection in Western blots (Fig.1A). Furthermore, in a simulated panning experiment, we were able to selectively enrich λ phages displaying Max by 1000-fold after three cycles of affinity purification over glutathione resin containing GST-Mad (Fig.1B). Thus, λD4 was selected for the display of domain repertoires. Repertoires were constructed by mutating only selected amino acids within the scaffold domain sequences, because the library size necessary to fully represent the diversity obtainable by random variations would rapidly saturate the possibilities of phage display libraries. The sequences of Max HLHZip and Heb E-protein HLH were taken as scaffolds for the two domain families (Figs. 2 and 3) because of their dimerization versatility and because of the availability of either their high resolution crystallographic structure (Max (17Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Google Scholar, 18Brownlie P. Ceska T. Lamers M. Romier C. Stier G. Teo H. Suck D. Structure. 1997; 5: 509-520Google Scholar)) or that of a close relative (E47, an E-protein that shares a high degree of homology with Heb (19Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Google Scholar)). The amino acid sequences of a large number of HLH and HLHZip domains from different organisms were aligned and the occurrence of different amino acids in each position determined. Strictly conserved residues, likely to be essential for domain stability, were maintained constant in the repertoire design, whereas the artificial repertoire variation was directed at residues that presented natural variability or were shown to be involved in contacts between subunits in the dimeric structures of Max, E47, MyoD, USF, PHO4, and SREBP (17Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Google Scholar, 18Brownlie P. Ceska T. Lamers M. Romier C. Stier G. Teo H. Suck D.

Because a complete randomization of these residues could not be represented fully in a phage display library, only the amino acids found in natural proteins were included in the design. In this way, diversity was reduced to about 7 × 108 combinations, representing a large fraction of the variability observed in natural domains (Figs. 2B and 3B).Figure 3Design of an HLHZip domain repertoire. A, overview of Max bHLHZip dimers complexed with DNA (17Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Google Scholar). The first and last residues of Max bHLHZip domain (A22 and L104) are indicated. The subdomains are highlighted with different colors in one monomer; the bHLH has the same color code as described in the legend for Fig. 2, and the leucine zipper is red. The positions mutated in the repertoires are in lighter tones.B, outline of the Zip region repertoire. Zip region sequence alignments of the most representative bHLHZip proteins, grouped in subfamilies, are shown underneath the Max sequence, which is used as scaffold. The most conserved residues are highlighted. Degenerate position numbers are shownabove these sequences. Nucleotide composition and encoded amino acids for each degenerate position are shown at thetop; the classical a-b-c-d-e-f-g heptad repeat of helical structures is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In more detail, in the bHLHZip repertoire the degeneration was restricted to the 29-amino acid-long Zip region, which previously had been shown to dictate recognition specificity among bHLHZip domains (6Soucek L. Helmer-Citterich M. Sacco A. Jucker R. Cesareni G. Nasi S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2463-2472Google Scholar, 24Amati B. Brooks M.W. Levy N. Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Land H.

Gagne S.M. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 165-181Google Scholar). We introduced variations at 13 amino acids occupying the a, d, e, andg positions of the helical wheel (Fig. 3B). These residues represent the interface between the two Zip monomers, whereas the b, c, and f positions are solvent-exposed and were therefore kept invariant (17Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Google Scholar, 20Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 180-189Google Scholar, 25Muhle-Goll C. Gibson T. Schuck P.

The 44-amino acid-long HLH domain has a more complex structure (Fig. 2A). The helix-loop-helix dimerization motif is a compact four-helix bundle, where the two α-helices package in a coiled-coil only near the carboxyl terminus of the dimer (19Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Google Scholar). In this case, also residues at b, c, and fpositions significantly contribute to the four-helix bundle. Moreover, loop residues, such as Gln22 and Thr23in the E-proteins, are involved in intermolecular bonds (19Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, the 15 positions illustrated in Fig.2B were degenerated in the designed repertoire. Among the residues that were left unchanged there are those at positions 8, 24, 28, 35, 38 in which mutation had previously been shown to impair dimerization (28Voronova A. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4722-4726Google Scholar). Degenerate DNA sequences encoding the designed HLH and bHLHZip domain repertoires were synthesized by PCR and cloned in the display vector λD4 as fusions to the D capsid protein C terminus (8Panni S. Dente L. Cesareni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21666-21674Google Scholar). Followingin vitro packaging, ∼2 × 106 and ∼1 × 106 pfu were obtained for the HLH and bHLHZip libraries, respectively. By PCR amplification and sequencing of DNA inserts from randomly chosen phage plaques, we found that ∼807 of the phages in each library were recombinant, and that each one contained an insert incorporating from 5 to 10 amino acid changes when compared with the natural scaffold sequence (data not shown). GST fusions to MyoD and Id2, or to Mad and Rox, were used as baits for panning the HLH and the HLHZip libraries, respectively. For each experiment, after three rounds of selection, ∼100 phage clones were amplified, and the interactions with the protein baits were tested by a filter assay. Approximately 107 of the isolated phage clones could be proved to display protein domains that consistently bound the bait. Binding was specific because the clones did not bind GST alone or GST fusions to unrelated protein domains, such as p75 neurotrophin receptor and amyloid precursor protein cytoplasmic regions. We quantified the interaction to MyoD, Id2, HEB, Rox, Mad, and Max by ELISA, revealing a number of phage clones with high binding affinity (Figs.4 and 5). The amino acid sequences of HLH(Zip) inserts were deduced from the DNA sequences and aligned to pinpoint the residues responsible for dimerization specificity and affinity. A number of differences were evident in the sequence alignment (Figs. 4B and5B). The amino acid frequency profiles of the domains with the highest and the lowest affinity for Id2, MyoD, Mad, and Rox are shown in Tables I and II.Figure 5Sequence and binding affinity of selected bHLHZip domains.

Residues, in the same color code as described in Fig. 3legend, are connected to the amino acid substitutions introduced in the repertoires (yellow). B, amino acid sequences and relative binding strengths. Phage clones were affinity selected from the bHLHZip repertoire using GST-Mad and GST-Rox as baits. Dimerization of phage clones and a λ-Max control with Max, Mad, and Rox bHLHZip domains was measured by ELISA. Relative binding strengths, normalized and expressed in arbitrary units (average values ± S.D. from five independent experiments), are indicated on the left of each clone. The amino acid sequence of Max Zip region, used as scaffold in the repertoire design, is underlined; the residues introduced in each degenerate position are indicatedabove the Max sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IAmino acid frequency profile of affinity-selected HLH domainsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Open table in a new tab Table IIZip region amino acid frequency profile of affinity-selected bHLHZip domainsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Open table in a new tab The protein domains isolated from the HLH repertoire were shown in ELISA experiments to bind MyoD, Id2, and Heb with different intensities, ranging from 1 to 8 on an arbitrary scale (Fig.4B and Table I). Id2 was invariably bound more strongly than MyoD, reflecting the different interaction strength between natural E-proteins and the two baits (1Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Google Scholar, 28Voronova A. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4722-4726Google Scholar). Amino acid alignment showed a preference for many residues of the E-protein consensus sequence, suggesting that these residues increase dimer stability (Fig.4B and Table I). They include Ile1, Gly9, Met11, and Cys12 in helix 1, Gln22 and Thr23 in the loop, and Leu25 and Val34 in helix 2. The sequence glycine, methionine, and cysteine at positions 9, 11, and 12 is a specific motif of E-proteins, which precedes their extra helical turn at the helix 1 C terminus (Fig. 2B (19Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Google Scholar)). At positions 11 and 12 only a few of the residues present in the repertoire were found in the selected domains; the preference for Cys12 was stronger than for Met11 (76 versus 537). All possible amino acids were found at position 9, where glycine occurred with a 657 frequency, and it was strongly preferred by high affinity binders (domains 43M, 72I, 42I, 13I, 98M, 27M, 18I, and 43I). Gly9 was present whenever Ile27 was found (domains 13I, 53I, 98M, 27M), an observation that suggests a possible interaction between residues 9 and 27, two positions involved in intrachain interactions according to HLH modeling studies (30Chavali G.B. Vijayalakshmi C. Salunke D.M. Proteins. 2001; 42: 471-480Google Scholar). The positive correlation between a Gly9 residue and dimerization strength can be explained by structural similarity to the E47 dimer (19Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Google Scholar), which shows an intrachain hydrogen bond between Gly9 and Gln22, a loop residue present in all selected clones. The four-helix bundle must be stabilized if this interaction is preserved in the mutant domains. A similar argument can also explain the preference for Thr23, which, in the E47 dimer, interacts with Leu26, a residue not mutated in the repertoire. Thr23 was found in all domains but two (71I and 37M) that have a Ser residue and are not very strong binders, whereas Pro was never selected. Unlike the majority of the residues, the three negatively charged glutamates found in E-proteins at positions 3, 7, and 39 were either totally absent (Glu3, Glu39) or present (Glu7) only in domains that did not strongly interact with MyoD and Id2 (14I, 24I, 30I, 92M; Fig. 4B), whereas hydrophobic or neutral amino acids (Leu, Val, Ala, Pro, Asn, Gln, Thr) were preferred in the domains isolated by panning. This was not because of under-representation, because the glutamates were present at the expected frequency in the HLH repertoire, as indicated by sequencing of random clones (Table I). The three glutamates are involved in E47 dimerization; Glu3 and Glu7 are on the surface of helix 1, nearest to helix 2′, whereas Glu39, on helix 2, interacts with His15′, on helix 1′ (19Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Google Scholar). It is interesting to remark the E39Q and V34Y substitutions in the 72I domain, a high affinity binder to Id2 and MyoD, because Gln and Tyr are found at the corresponding helix 2 positions in MyoD and Id2 and in the yeast bHLH, Pho4. In the Pho4 dimer, in particular, the two residues form an interhelical hydrogen bond, which is not possible in the E47 dimer (22Shimizu T. Toumoto A. Ihara K. Shimizu M. Kyogoku Y. Ogawa N.

https://openalex.org/W2009836949,"Cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT) is a tetrameric, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of serine and tetrahydrofolate to glycine and methylenetetrahydrofolate. The enzyme has four active sites and is best described as a dimer of obligate dimers. Each monomeric subunit within the obligate dimer contributes catalytically important amino acid residues to both active sites. To investigate the interchange of subunits among cSHMT tetramers, a dominant-negative human cSHMT enzyme (DNcSHMT) was engineered by making three amino acid substitutions: K257Q, Y82A, and Y83F. Purified recombinant DNcSHMT protein was catalytically inactive and did not bind 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. Coexpression of the cSHMT and DNcSHMT proteins in bacteria resulted in the formation of heterotetramers with a cSHMT/DNcSHMT subunit ratio of 1. Characterization of the cSHMT/DNcSHMT heterotetramers indicates that DNcSHMT and cSHMT monomers randomly associate to form tetramers and that cSHMT/DNcSHMT obligate dimers are catalytically inactive. Incubation of recombinant cSHMT protein with recombinant DNcSHMT protein did not result in the formation of hetero-oligomers, indicating that cSHMT subunits do not exchange once the tetramer is assembled. However, removal of the active site PLP cofactor does permit exchange of obligate dimers among preformed cSHMT and DNcSHMT tetramers, and the formation of heterotetramers from cSHMT and DNcSHMT homodimers does not affect the activity of the cSHMT homodimers. The results of these studies demonstrate that PLP inhibits dimer exchange among cSHMT tetramers and suggests that cellular PLP concentrations may influence the stability of cSHMT protein in vivo.

The mitochondrial SHMT gene is expressed at similar levels in most mammalian tissues, whereas the cSHMT gene exhibits a dynamic range of tissue-specific expression (5Girgis S. Nasrallah I.M. Suh J.R.

Mammalian SHMT enzymes are 55-kDa homotetramers with four active sites/tetramer. High resolution structures are available for the human, mouse, and rabbit cSHMT enzymes, some with amino acid and folate substrates bound (8Renwick S.B. Snell K. Baumann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 1105-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9Szebenyi D.M. Liu X. Kriksunov I.A. Stover P.J. Thiel D.J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8347-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). All of the solved cSHMT structures reveal that the enzyme is best described as a dimer of tight, obligate dimers. Each obligate dimer contains two active sites, and catalytically essential amino acid residues from each monomer contribute to both active sites. Tetramer formation results from the relatively weak association of two obligate dimers. Analysis of the mouse cSHMT structure reveals that the tetramer contact surface is small, involving residues 135–137, 154–157, 168–171, and 189–194 of each monomer (9Szebenyi D.M. Liu X. Kriksunov I.A. Stover P.J. Thiel D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13313-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Prokaryotic SHMT enzymes lack residues that lie at the tetramer interface and are catalytically active as obligate dimers in solution (11Scarsdale J.N. Radaev S. Kazanina G. Schirch V. Wright H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Trivedi V. Gupta A. Jala V.R. Saravanan P. Rao G.S. Rao N.A. Savithri H.S. Subramanya H.S. J. Biol.

Mammalian SHMT isozymes are tetramers in solution but form mixtures of dimers and tetramers in the absence of bound PLP (13Jagath J.R. Sharma B. Rao N.A. Savithri H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24355-24362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The dissociation of cSHMT tetramers into obligate dimers in the absence of bound PLP suggests that the catalytic site of the enzyme communicates with amino residues at the tetramer interface. Site-directed mutations that alter amino acid residues near the tetramer interface site or that decrease the affinity of PLP for the enzyme weaken the interactions between two obligate dimers (13Jagath J.R.

Savithri H.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 257-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, recombinant D89N cSHMT from sheep has decreased catalytic activity and is a mixture of dimers and tetramers in solution (14Krishna Rao J.V. Jagath J.R. Sharma B. Appaji Rao N. Savithri H.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 257-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant H134N cSHMT from sheep has decreased affinity for PLP and is present in solution as a mixture of tetramers and dimers (13Jagath J.R. Sharma B. Rao N.A. Savithri H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24355-24362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The H134N cSHMT dimers are active, but the specific activity of the enzyme reduced by 75% compared with the nonmutated enzyme under conditions of saturating PLP. This study indicates that tetramer formation is not necessary for cSHMT catalytic activity (13Jagath J.R. Sharma B. Rao N.A. Savithri H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24355-24362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To better understand the stability of cSHMT tetramers and the interaction of subunits within cSHMT tetramers and to further examine the relationship between tetramer formation and cSHMT activity, we engineered a catalytically inactive, dominant-negative cSHMT enzyme (DNcSHMT). The results from these studies provide evidence that neither monomers nor obligate dimers exchange among preformed cSHMT tetramers in the presence of PLP. However, loss of cSHMT-bound PLP permits exchange of obligate dimers, but not monomers, among preformed cSHMT tetramers. Furthermore, we show that cSHMT and DNcSHMT heterodimers are catalytically inactive, indicating that the DNcSHMT monomer effectively deactivates endogenous cSHMT activity. 5-FormylTHF, allothreonine, alcohol dehydrogenase, NADH, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, lysozyme, and pyridoxal 5-phosphate were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade. The restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega and Invitrogen. The pET22b and pET28a vectors were obtained from Novagen. TOPO vector, TOP 10 competent cells, and BL21* competent cells were obtained from Invitrogen. The DNcSHMT cDNA was constructed using the human cSHMT cDNA as a template. Site mutations were incorporated into the cSHMT cDNA using the following primers. The forward primer was 5′-tctgagggtacccgggccagagagcctttggcgggactgag-3′ with the KpnI site underlined and the altered nucleotides in bold type, which result in Y83A and Y82F codon substitutions in the recombinant protein. The reverse primer was 5′-ttgggatccacacttttcactcctttcctgtagaagatcatgccagctcggcagcctcgcagggtctggtgagtgg-3′ with the BamHI site underlined and the altered nucleotides shown in bold type resulting in a K257Q codon substitution in the human protein. The region of the cSHMT cDNA that encodes the targeted amino acid residues was amplified by PCR: 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s with a 10-min extension at 72 °C. The DNcSHMT cDNA was generated by replacing the KpnI-BamHI fragment within the human cSHMT cDNA with the PCR product that contains the three codon substitutions. The DNcSHMT cDNA was subcloned into theNdeI and NotI restriction sites of the pET22b expression vector, which confers kanamycin resistance. The cSHMT cDNA was subcloned into pET28a expression vector in frame with the N terminus polyhistidine tag using the NdeI andNotI restriction sites, and this vector confers ampicillin resistance. The mutated cDNAs were sequence-verified. The expression vectors containing the cSHMT and DNcSHMT cDNAs were transformed into competent BL21* bacteria both singly and in combination. One-liter cultures of BL21* cells expressing the cSHMT and DNcSHMT or coexpressing cSHMT and DNcSHMT cDNAs were grown to mid-log phase, and protein synthesis was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 8 h at room temperature. The cell pellets were harvested and stored at −80 °C until purification. The cell pellets were lysed in a buffer containing 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 nm PLP using a French press, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. For purification of the DNcSHMT protein, the clarified supernatant was applied directly to a CM Sepharose ion exchange column (Clontech), and the protein was purified to homogeneity as described previously (15Kruschwitz H. Ren S. Di Salvo M. Schirch V. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recombinant SHMT from either bacteria that expressed the cSHMT protein or that coexpressed cSHMT and DNcSHMT proteins was purified by affinity chromatography. The cell suspensions were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet-insoluble material. The cSHMT protein, which contains an N-terminal polyhistidine tag, was purified from the clarified sample on a Talon® metal affinity resin following the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). The purity of all proteins was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry assay (16Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). The purified protein was stored at −80 °C. Michaelis-Menten constants were determined for the cSHMT and DNcSHMT-catalyzed cleavage of allothreonine using the coupled enzyme assay with alcohol dehydrogenase as described previously (17Schirch L. Gross T. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5651-5655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of absorbance loss at 340 nm was recorded after the addition of 300–2000 pmol of SHMT to a 1-ml cuvette containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, allothreonine, alcohol dehydrogenase, and 0.15 mm NADH in a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2401PC). The affinity of recombinant DNcSHMT protein for 5-formylTHF was determined by a previously described competitive binding assay (18Strong W.B. Cook R. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The binding of reduced folates to cSHMT results in the formation of a PLP-glycine-quinonoid intermediate, which has an absorption maximum at 502 nm (ε = 40,000) (19Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1543-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNcSHMT does not form the quinonoid intermediate and therefore did not exhibit an increase in absorbance at 502 nm upon binding 5-formylTHF. For the competitive binding assay, recombinant human cSHMT protein (10 μm) was added to a cuvette that contained 1 ml of the reaction buffer (200 mm glycine, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and 10 μm (6S) 5-formylTHF (a value equal to theK d)). The absorbance spectrum was recorded from 550 to 400 nm. Recombinant DNcSHMT was added (to a final concentration of 25 μm), and the spectrum was recorded. To quantify the affinity of DNcSHMT for 5-formylTHF, the loss of absorbance at 502 nm was recorded as a function of DNcSHMT added to the cuvette as described previously (18Strong W.B. Cook R. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The ability of SHMT monomeric subunits to exchange among preformed cSHMT tetramers was determined by incubating purified, recombinant cSHMT protein (5 μm) in a solution containing 200 mm glycine, 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.3, and 200 μm (6RS) 5-formylTHF. The absorbance spectrum of the protein was recorded from 550 to 450 nm. Then DNcSHMT was added to a final concentration of 20 μm, and the spectra were recorded following 10-min, 1-h, and 24-h incubations at 37 °C. Loss of absorbance at 502 nm indicates that recombinant cSHMT monomers are exchanging with DNcSHMT monomers. To determine the effect of glycine or 5-formylTHF on monomer exchange, glycine and 5-formylTHF were omitted from the incubation solution. Following incubation, glycine (200 mm) and 5-formylTHF (200 μm) were added to the protein solution, and the absorbance spectrum was recorded immediately. For all of the experiments, the absorbance at 502 nm was recorded for the protein that underwent the exchange reaction and compared with the absorbance at 502 nm for purified cSHMT protein that did not undergo the exchange reaction. PLP was removed from the cSHMT active site by the addition of l-cysteine, which reacts with the bound PLP to form a thiazolidine complex (20Schirch D. Delle Fratte S. Iurescia S. Angelaccio S. Contestabile R. Bossa F. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23132-23138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).l-Cysteine (16 mg/ml) was added to a 2-ml solution that contained 3 mg of cSHMT (with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag), 20 mg of DNcSHMT, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The solution was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The protein was precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation, incubated on ice for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 4300 rpm for 20 min. The precipitated protein pellet was suspended in 2 ml of 100 mml-cysteine, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. This cycle was repeated three times, and the protein was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The procedure lasted 3 h in duration. The protein was then dialyzed for 24 h against 2 liters of 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm glycine, and 100 nmPLP at 4 °C. A control reaction contained 3 mg of cSHMT (with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag), 20 mg of DNcSHMT, and 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol and was incubated at room temperature for the duration of the procedure described and stored at 4 °C for the duration of the dialysis described above. After 24 h, both the experimental and control proteins were dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm glycine, and 100 nm PLP for 1 h at 4 °C. The proteins were each purified using the batch/gravity flow protocol for the Talon® metal affinity resin (Clontech) with the following buffers: extraction/wash buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm glycine, and PLP), stringent wash buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm glycine, PLP, and 12.5 mm imidazole), and elution buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 100 mmNaCl, 50 mm glycine, PLP, and 200 mmimidazole). Each protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 100 mm glycine, 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 nm PLP and then analyzed for exchange by SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were quantified using ChemiImager 4400 from Alpha Innotech Corp. (San Leandro, CA). This densitometry method was validated by analyzing a series of gels that contained 0.5–10 μg of cSHMT protein/lane. The optical density values increased linearly as a function of cSHMT concentrations from 0.5 to 4 μg cSHMT/lane. Purified proteins (1–3 μg) were suspended in buffer containing 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol and then incubated at 100 °C for 10 min. The purified proteins were then run on a mini-SDS-PAGE using a 5% stacking gel and 12% separating gel in a slab gel apparatus (Bio-Rad) with the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli. To study the assembly of cSHMT tetramers and the occurrence of dynamic interchange of cSHMT subunits among cSHMT tetramers, a human DNcSHMT protein was designed using information derived from previous studies of mutated cSHMT proteins, as well as information derived from the murine cSHMT protein crystal structure (9Szebenyi D.M. Liu X. Kriksunov I.A. Stover P.J. Thiel D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13313-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The murine cSHMT structure was solved with glycine and 5-formylTHF bound at the active site. The cSHMT-Gly-5-formylTHF ternary complex is an intermediate state analog of the cSHMT-Ser-THF catalytic complex (9Szebenyi D.M. Liu X. Kriksunov I.A. Stover P.J. Thiel D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13313-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and this structure was used to design rationally a dominant-negative SHMT protein that can deactivate cSHMT activity. The DNcSHMT protein was designed to: 1) oligomerize with and deactivate recombinant cSHMT monomeric subunits by inhibiting serine and allothreonine cleavage activity, 2) have decreased affinity for folate, and 3) retain affinity for PLP. Modeling studies indicated that three amino acid substitutions on a single cSHMT polypeptide were needed to achieve these goals, and these three amino acids are conserved in all known SHMT enzymes (Fig. 1 A). Lys257 is the active site lysine in the murine and human cSHMTs that forms a Schiff base with the PLP cofactor. Mutation of this active site Lys to Gln inactivates the Escherichia colicSHMT. The mutated protein can catalyze only a single turnover; this mutation does not allow the expulsion of the amino acid product, and therefore subsequent turnover is inhibited. However, this mutant retains affinity for folate cofactors and purifies with a PLP and a bound amino acid (20Schirch D. Delle Fratte S. Iurescia S. Angelaccio S. Contestabile R. Bossa F. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23132-23138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I). Tyr83 in the human and mouse cSHMT forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of the amino acid substrate, and mutation of the analogous residue in the E. coli SHMT to Phe decreases the specific activity of the protein by greater than 99% and increases the affinity of the enzyme for tetrahydrofolate (Table I) (21Contestabile R. Angelaccio S. Bossa F. Wright H.T. Scarsdale N. Kazanina G. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7492-7500Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Tyr83 and Lys257 from the same polypeptide function in different active sites within the obligate dimer, and therefore dimerization between cSHMT and SHMT monomers that contain the double mutation, Y83F/K257Q, would be expected to lack catalytic activity in both subunits but retain folate binding in both subunits (Fig. 1). A third mutation was designed to eliminate folate binding to the DNcSHMT protein. The crystal structure of the murine SHMT protein shows that Tyr82 forms a stacking interaction with thep-aminobenzoylglutamate moiety of THF that is predicted to be essential for THF binding (Fig. 1), although this has not been tested experimentally (9Szebenyi D.M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13313-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Table IPredicted properties of the DNcSHMT based on studies of the E. coli SHMTK257Q(20)Y83F(21)Ability to form reaction intermediatesGeminal diaminenoyesExternal aldimineyesyesQuinonoid< 0.1%noActivityAllothreonine cleavageK mNDaND, not determined.reduced 19-foldk cat0decreased 98.6%Serine cleavageK m(Ser)NDreduced 435-foldK m(THF)NDreduced 3-foldk cat0decreased > 99%Glycine proton exchange (with tetrahydrofolate)k catNDdecreased > 99%a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The DNcSHMT monomer was engineered by making three amino acid substitutions: K257Q, Y82A, and Y83F (Fig. 1 B). Purified recombinant DNcSHMT is expected to retain high affinity for PLP in the presence of amino acid substrates but to lack serine cleavage catalytic activity and affinity for folate cofactors. Oligomerization of the DNcSHMT monomer with a cSHMT monomer will generate two active sites (Fig. 1, C and D). Active site C lacks Lys257 and therefore should lack catalytic activity but retain affinity for folate cofactors. Site D lacks Tyr82and Tyr83 and therefore is anticipated to have less than 1% serine cleavage activity and decreased affinity for folate cofactors. The DNcSHMT and cSHMT proteins were coexpressed inE. coli to test the ability of the DNcSHMT monomers to oligomerize with and inactive cSHMT protein as illustrated in Fig. 1. The human recombinant cSHMT cDNA was engineered with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag to enable affinity purification of this protein; the DNcSHMT cDNA lacked a coding sequence for the polyhistidine tag. Fig. 2 A (lanes 1and 2) shows that both the cSHMT and DNcSHMT proteins can be expressed in E. coli and that the cSHMT protein can be separated from the DNcSHMT protein by SDS-PAGE because of its increased molecular mass resulting from the polyhistidine tag. Fig. 2 A(lane 3) shows that the cSHMT protein is more abundant in crude extracts of E. coli that coexpress the cSHMT and DNcSHMT proteins. Following purification, all of the recombinant proteins were greater than 95% pure (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–3). As expected, affinity purification of cSHMT protein fromE. coli that coexpressed the cSHMT and DNcSHMT proteins also resulted in the purification of DNcSHMT protein, indicating that the cSHMT and DNcSHMT subunits associate with one another. Additionally, the ratio of cSHMT to DNcSHMT monomeric subunits in purified cSHMT/DNcSHMT protein was 1.0, despite the higher concentration of cSHMT protein compared with DNcSHMT protein in the crude extracts. This indicates that cSHMT monomers may have higher affinity for DNcSHMT monomers than other cSHMT monomers. Two models were derived to predict the assembly and catalytic activity of cSHMT/DNcSHMT heterotetramers (Fig. 3). Model I is a random association model whereby cSHMT and DNcSHMT monomers randomly associate to form heterodimers and homodimers, which randomly associate to form homotetramers and heterotetramers (Fig. 3, model I). Model 2 predicts that cSHMT and DNcSHMT monomers can only form homodimers but that homodimers can randomly associate to form homotetramers and heterotetramers. Assuming equal concentrations of cSHMT and DNcSHMT monomers (as shown in Fig. 2), the expected frequency of each potential tetramer was calculated for models I and II. Additionally, the activity of each tetramer was predicted by assuming that both DNcSHMT homodimers and DNcSHMT/cSHMT heterodimers are inactive and that the formation of tetramers from obligate dimers does not influence the activity of either obligate dimer. The expected specific activity of the purified cSHMT/DNcSHMT protein will be the average of the specific activity for each tetrameric isoform, after correcting for its relative abundance. If the random association model is correct (model I), we anticipate that the specific activity of the cSHMT/DNcSHMT tetrameric protein will be reduced by 75% compared with tetrameric cSHMT protein. For model II, the cSHMT/DNcSHMT tetrameric protein is predicted to exhibit a 50% decrease in specific activity compared with cSHMT protein. The cSHMT protein is a PLP-dependent enzyme, and the reaction intermediates associated with catalysis have distinct spectral properties. PLP binds to cSHMT through a Schiff base with Lys257 forming an intermediate known as the internal aldimine (Fig.4, structure 1). Binding of amino acid substrates results in the formation of the geminal diamine (Fig. 4, structure 2), which is a tetrahedral intermediate that results from partial displacement of Lys257 by the incoming amino acid. Full displacement of Lys257 results in a Schiff base between the amino acid substrate and the active site PLP, an intermediate known as the external aldimine (Fig. 4, structure 3). Loss of the pro-2S proton of glycine, or the hydroxymethyl group of serine, results in the formation of a highly conjugated glycine quinonoid intermediate (Fig. 4, structure 4). Fig. 5 A shows the spectrum of the cSHMT-Gly binary complex (spectrum 1) and the cSHMT-Gly-5-formylTHF ternary complex (spectrum 2). The absorbance spectrum of the cSHMT-glycine binary complex shows the presence of the external aldimine (λmax = 425 nm) and the glycine quinonoid (λmax = 492 nm). The addition of 5-formylTHF shifts the equilibrium of the enzyme-bound PLP to the glycine quinonoid (λmax = 502 nm). Fig. 5 Bshows the spectrum of the DNcSHMT-Gly binary complex (spectrum 1) and that of the DNcSHMT-Gly binary complex in the presence of 5-formylTHF (spectrum 2). Previous studies have demonstrated that the Lys to Gln mutation does not permit formation of the internal aldimine or geminal diamine (20Schirch D. Delle F"
