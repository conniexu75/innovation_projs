https://openalex.org/W1997301424,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with functional alterations in a distributed network of brain regions linked to memory function, with a recent focus on the cortical regions collectively known as the default network. Posterior components of the default network, including the precuneus and posterior cingulate, are particularly vulnerable to early deposition of amyloid beta-protein, one of the hallmark pathologies of AD. In this study, we use in vivo amyloid imaging to demonstrate that high levels of amyloid deposition are associated with aberrant default network functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity in asymptomatic and minimally impaired older individuals, similar to the pattern of dysfunction reported in AD patients. These findings suggest that amyloid pathology is linked to neural dysfunction in brain regions supporting memory function and provide support for the hypothesis that cognitively intact older individuals with evidence of amyloid pathology may be in early stages of AD."

Here we used non-targeted metabolic profiling to determine the contribution of metabolites produced by the gut microbiota towards disease status of the host. Ion Cyclotron Resonance Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry (ICR-FT/MS) was used to discern the masses of thousands of metabolites in fecal samples collected from 17 identical twin pairs, including healthy individuals and those with CD. Pathways with differentiating metabolites included those involved in the metabolism and or synthesis of amino acids, fatty acids, bile acids and arachidonic acid. Several metabolites were positively or negatively correlated to the disease phenotype and to specific microbes previously characterized in the same samples. Our data reveal novel differentiating metabolites for CD that may provide diagnostic biomarkers and/or monitoring tools as well as insight into potential targets for disease therapy and prevention."
https://openalex.org/W1969252152,"Asymmetric cell division of radial glial progenitors produces neurons while allowing self-renewal; however, little is known about the mechanism that generates asymmetry in daughter cell fate specification. Here, we found that mammalian partition defective protein 3 (mPar3), a key cell polarity determinant, exhibits dynamic distribution in radial glial progenitors. While it is enriched at the lateral membrane domain in the ventricular endfeet during interphase, mPar3 becomes dispersed and shows asymmetric localization as cell cycle progresses. Either removal or ectopic expression of mPar3 prevents radial glial progenitors from dividing asymmetrically yet generates different outcomes in daughter cell fate specification. Furthermore, the expression level of mPar3 affects Notch signaling, and manipulations of Notch signaling or Numb expression suppress mPar3 regulation of radial glial cell division and daughter cell fate specification. These results reveal a critical molecular pathway underlying asymmetric cell division of radial glial progenitors in the mammalian neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W2106567407,"A fundamental goal in memory research is to understand what class of learning problem the hippocampus is uniquely designed to solve. While much controversy surrounds the particular types of memories the hippocampus is thought to support, one hypothesized function possibly linking divergent frameworks is the capacity to bind mnemonic representations across spatial and temporal gaps in our experience. In our current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we systematically controlled the extent to which a target and an event detail have to be integrated across spatiotemporal discontiguities during associative memory formation. Although the encoding task, the type of association, and subsequent memory performance were held constant, engagement of the hippocampus during successful associative binding was directly modulated by increases in spatial and temporal discontiguities across episodic elements. These results suggest that a core mnemonic function of the hippocampus is to bridge representational gaps in our experience."
https://openalex.org/W2063618791,"The mechanism coupling exocytosis and endocytosis remains to be elucidated at central synapses. Here, we show that the mechanism linking these two processes is dependent on microdomain-[Ca2+]i similar to that which triggers exocytosis, as well as the exocytotic protein synaptobrevin/VAMP. Furthermore, block of endocytosis has a limited, retrograde action on exocytosis, delaying recruitment of release-ready vesicles and enhancing short-term depression. This effect sets in so rapidly that it cannot be explained by the nonavailability of recycled vesicles. Rather, we postulate that perturbation of a step linking exocytosis and endocytosis temporarily prevents new vesicles from docking at specialized sites for exocytosis. The mechanism coupling exocytosis and endocytosis remains to be elucidated at central synapses.

Synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane upon presynaptic Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels. After exocytosis, membrane is retrieved by endocytosis, and the endocytosed vesicles are recycled for reuse (Stevens, 2003Stevens C.F. Neurotransmitter release at central synapses.Neuron. 2003; 40: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The time course of endocytosis varies depending on the stimulation patterns and among cell types but is often classified into fast and slow modes based upon time scale (Wu, 2004Wu L.G.

The fast mode of endocytosis has a time scale of 100 ms to a few seconds, whereas the slow mode has a time scale of seconds to minutes. The fast mode of endocytosis is often thought to be responsible for the “kiss-and-run” type of vesicle cycling and rapid reuse of synaptic vesicles, although fast endocytosis can be caused by rapid membrane retrieval after full collapse of synaptic vesicles without formation of a clathrin coat (Klyachko and Jackson, 2002Klyachko V.A.

Blocking the fast mode of endocytosis affects transmitter release by preventing the rapid reuse of synaptic vesicles (Deak et al., 2004Deak F. Schoch S. Liu X. Sudhof T.C. Kavalali E.T. Synaptobrevin is essential for fast synaptic-vesicle endocytosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, Ertunc et al., 2007Ertunc M. Sara Y. Chung C. Atasoy D.

The slow mode is mediated by classical, clathrin-mediated pathways. Also, it has been suggested that the sites of endocytosis are separated from that of exocytosis and that endocytosis occurs in a peripheral area surrounding the active zone (Heuser and Reese, 1973Heuser J.E.

Thus, exocytosis and endocytosis are assumed to be functionally independent of each other and, consistent with this idea, blockade of endocytosis does not immediately affect subsequent exocytosis (Shupliakov et al., 1997Shupliakov O.

USA. 2006; 103: 17955-17960Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Only a slow, secondary effect due to a reduction in the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles has been noticed (Yamashita et al., 2005Yamashita T. Hige T. Takahashi T.

USA. 2006; 103: 17955-17960Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). While the roles of Ca2+ in transmitter release are quite well established (Zucker and Regehr, 2002Zucker R.S. Regehr W.G. Short-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar, Neher and Sakaba, 2008Neher E. Sakaba T. Multiple roles of calcium ions in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2008; 59: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), its role in endocytosis remains unclear. The release machinery has a low affinity for Ca2+ and requires the binding of multiple Ca2+ ions. It has been also shown that synaptic vesicles and Ca2+ channels are tightly coupled and that local Ca2+ levels at the transmitter release sites rise to tens of μM and fall immediately upon the opening and closure of Ca2+ channels. It is this change in the Ca2+ levels that is responsible for rapid and phasic transmitter release. In contrast, the possible roles of Ca2+ in endocytosis are unclear, largely because the results are diverse among different preparations (Wu et al., 2007Wu L.G. Ryan T.A. Lagnado L. Modes of vesicle retrieval at ribbon synapses, calyx-type synapses, and small central synapses.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11793-11802Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a unifying scheme was proposed as follows (Wu, 2004Wu L.G. Kinetic regulation of vesicle endocytosis at synapses.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 548-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The fast mode of endocytosis is regulated by local Ca2+ achieved by microdomain Ca2+ at the active zone (Beutner et al., 2001Beutner D. Voets T. Neher E. Moser T.

Wu X.S. Wu L.G. Single and multiple vesicle fusion induce different rates of endocytosis at a central synapse.Nature. 2002; 417: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The calyx of Held synapse in the auditory brainstem has a very large presynaptic terminal, which is accessible to electrophysiological techniques, as well as optical methods (Forsythe, 1994Forsythe I.D. Direct patch recording from identified presynaptic terminals mediating glutamatergic EPSCs in the rat CNS, in vitro.J. Physiol. 1994; 479: 381-387PubMed Google Scholar). In the calyx terminal, both fast and slow modes of membrane retrieval have been reported. The fast mode (the time constant of ∼1 s) was seen after intense stimulation of the presynaptic terminal and was Ca2+-dependent (Wu et al., 2005Wu W. Xu J. Wu X.S. Wu L.G. Activity-dependent acceleration of endocytosis at a central synapse.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11676-11683Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, under low to mild stimulation, a slow mode of endocytosis was found to predominate, which is characterized by a much slower time course (several to tens of seconds; Yamashita et al., 2005Yamashita T. Hige T. Takahashi T. Vesicle endocytosis requires dynamin-dependent GTP hydrolysis at a fast CNS synapse.Science. 2005; 307: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, Lou et al., 2008Lou X. Paradise S. Ferguson S.M. De Camilli P. Selective saturation of slow endocytosis at a giant glutamatergic central synapse lacking dynamin 1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 17555-17560Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and which is insensitive to changes in the bulk Ca2+ up to concentrations of a few μM (Sun et al., 2002Sun J.Y. Wu X.S. Wu L.G. Single and multiple vesicle fusion induce different rates of endocytosis at a central synapse.Nature. 2002; 417: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the Ca2+ dependence of the slow mode of endocytosis at the calyx of Held synapse quantitatively, using presynaptic capacitance measurements to measure the time course of membrane retrieval, combined with Ca2+ uncaging and Ca2+ measurement techniques. In contrast to the previous study (Sun et al., 2002Sun J.Y. Wu X.S. Wu L.G. Single and multiple vesicle fusion induce different rates of endocytosis at a central synapse.Nature. 2002; 417: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), we find that Ca2+ regulates the rate of slow membrane retrieval at the calyx of Held. Sensitivity to Ca2+ buffers also suggests that a local Ca2+ microdomain created by multiple Ca2+ channels is responsible for slow endocytosis (Bollmann et al., 2000Bollmann J.H. Sakmann B. Borst J.G. Calcium sensitivity of glutamate release in a calyx-type terminal.Science. 2000; 289: 953-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000Schneggenburger R. Neher E. Intracellular calcium dependence of transmitter release rates at a fast central synapse.Nature. 2000; 406: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). In addition, we provide a role for the SNARE protein synaptobrevin in endocytosis. Furthermore, we extend our findings to provide evidence for an interaction between exo- and endocytosis by blocking endocytic proteins and examining the consequence on exocytosis. Interestingly, the interaction is limited to a slowing in the rate of synaptic vesicle recruitment for up to 1 s following exocytosis. We suggest that exocytosis and endocytosis interact with each other at the calyx of Held, although the kinetics of membrane retrieval are slow. First, we examined the basic features of endocytosis at the calyx of Held terminal by using capacitance measurements, similar to those carried out in previous studies (Sun et al., 2002Sun J.Y. Wu X.S. Wu L.G. Single and multiple vesicle fusion induce different rates of endocytosis at a central synapse.Nature. 2002; 417: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The presynaptic terminal of the calyx of Held (postnatal day 8–11) was whole-cell voltage clamped at −80 mV and the membrane capacitance was measured using the sine + DC technique (Lindau and Neher, 1988Lindau M. Neher E. Patch-clamp techniques for time-resolved capacitance measurements in single cells.Pflugers Arch. 1988; 411: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In Figure 1A, a train of action potential (AP)-like stimuli (20 depolarizing pulses to +40 mV for 1 ms, with a frequency of 100 Hz) was applied to the presynaptic terminal. In response to the train, a capacitance increase of 200 fF was observed, which reflected the fusion of between 2000 and 3000 vesicles (Sakaba, 2006Sakaba T. Roles of the fast-releasing and the slowly releasing vesicles in synaptic transmission at the calyx of held.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5863-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). On cessation of stimulation, the capacitance returned to baseline within 30 s, reflecting membrane retrieval. The rate of membrane retrieval was 10 fF/sec, similar to previous studies (Sun et al., 2002Sun J.Y. Wu X.S. Wu L.G.

Selective saturation of slow endocytosis at a giant glutamatergic central synapse lacking dynamin 1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 17555-17560Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In Figure 1B, we varied the amount of exocytosis by changing the number of AP-like stimulations (n = 16 cells). In some cases, a step depolarization was also applied to elicit larger amounts of exocytosis (>300 fF). As shown in Figure 1B, the endocytic time increased monotonically as the amount of exocytosis increased, although the slope was relatively shallow. This is consistent with previous studies and indicates that the membrane retrieval has a limited capacity (Sun et al., 2002Sun J.Y. Wu X.S. Wu L.G. Single and multiple vesicle fusion induce different rates of endocytosis at a central synapse.Nature. 2002; 417: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, Fernandez-Alfonso and Ryan, 2004Fernandez-Alfonso T. Ryan T.A. The kinetics of synaptic vesicle pool depletion at CNS synaptic terminals.Neuron. 2004; 41: 943-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The kinetics of endocytosis measured here correspond to that termed slow endocytosis (more than several seconds) in previous studies, since induction of fast endocytosis requires massive stimulation (more than 200 APs at 100 Hz; Wu et al., 2005Wu W. Xu J. Wu X.S. Wu L.G. Activity-dependent acceleration of endocytosis at a central synapse.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11676-11683Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Slow endocytosis is usually thought of as being mediated by a clathrin-dependant pathway; which involves the complex, multistep assembly of clathrin cages on the plasma membrane and their eventual retrieval. In brief, clathrin coat formation is initiated using the adaptor protein AP2. AP2 not only recruits clathrin to the plasma membrane by binding it to plasma membrane cargo but it is also responsible for recruiting the accessory protein amphiphysin to the site of endocytosis. In turn, amphiphysin recruits dynamin, which is responsible for mediating membrane scission via GTP hydrolysis (Schmid and McMahon, 2007Schmid E.M. McMahon H.T. Integrating molecular and network biology to decode endocytosis.Nature. 2007; 448: 883-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to investigate the role of clathrin in mediating slow endocytosis at the calyx of Held synapse, by applying four compounds known to block clathrin-mediated endocytosis at these discrete stages; dynasore (100 μM) which is known to block the GTPase activity of dynamin (Macia et al., 2006Macia E. Ehrlich M. Massol R. Boucrot E. Brunner C. Kirchhausen T. Dynasore, a cell-permeable inhibitor of dynamin.Dev.

Inhibition of dynamin completely blocks compensatory synaptic vesicle endocytosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17955-17960Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), a dynamin inhibitory peptide (1 mM), which interferes with the binding of dynamin to the SH3 domain of amphiphysin (Shupliakov et al., 1997Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis impaired by disruption of dynamin-SH3 domain interactions.Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), C2B domain peptide of synaptotagmin 2 (10–100 μM), which sequesters AP2 and prevents it participating in clathrin cargo formation (Grass et al., 2004Grass I. Thiel S. Honing S. Haucke V. Recognition of a basic AP-2 binding motif within the C2B domain of synaptotagmin is dependent on multimerization.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54872-54880Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and an AP2 blocking peptide (100 μM), which disrupts the interaction between AP2 and amphiphysin (Jockusch et al., 2005Jockusch W.J. Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. Lagnado L. Clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent retrieval of synaptic vesicles in retinal bipolar cells.Neuron. 2005; 46: 869-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The peptides were applied directly to the presynaptic terminal via a patch pipette, whereas dynasore was applied extracellularly (with a preincubation of between 15 and 60 min). Both dynasore and the dynamin inhibitory peptide blocked membrane retrieval as shown in Figure 1C (n = 4 cells each, see Figure S1, available online, for a summary plot), consistent with previous results at the calyx of Held (Yamashita et al., 2005Yamashita T. Hige T. Takahashi T. Vesicle endocytosis requires dynamin-dependent GTP hydrolysis at a fast CNS synapse.Science. 2005; 307: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 2008Xu J. McNeil B. Wu W. Nees D. Bai L. Wu L.G. GTP-independent rapid and slow endocytosis at a central synapse.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The C2B domain peptide of synaptotagmin 2 also blocked endocytosis at the calyx of Held (Figure 1C; n = 6). Furthermore, an AP2 blocking peptide also abolished endocytosis (Figure 1D, left panel; n = 4). In contrast, a point-mutated AP2 blocking peptide, which has a 50 times lower affinity for AP2 (Olesen et al., 2008Olesen L.E. Ford M.G. Schmid E.M. Vallis Y. Babu M.M. Li P.H. Mills I.G. McMahon H.T. Praefcke G.J. Solitary and repetitive binding motifs for the AP2 complex alpha-appendage in amphiphysin and other accessory proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5099-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was ineffective in blocking endocytosis at an equivalent concentration (Figure 1D, right panel; n = 6 cells). These results suggest that slow endocytosis at the calyx of Held synapse is dependent on dynamin and AP2. It has been previously reported that slow endocytosis at the calyx of Held terminal is Ca2+ independent, because modulation of internal Ca2+ concentration to a low micromolar level did not change the rate of endocytosis (Sun et al., 2002Sun J.Y. Wu X.S. Wu L.G. Single and multiple vesicle fusion induce different rates of endocytosis at a central synapse.Nature. 2002; 417: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Here, we reinvestigated the role of calcium in endocytosis at higher intracellular concentrations. Two classical manipulations were used to lower intracellular Ca2+ concentration during neuronal stimulation. First, lowering the extracellular Ca2+ reduces Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels and hence both the local Ca2+, close to the channels, and also the bulk Ca2+ level. We examined the Ca2+ dependence of endocytosis by changing the external Ca2+ concentration from 2 mM to 0.8 mM. Lowering the external Ca2+ reduced the presynaptic Ca2+ currents, EPSC amplitudes and the cumulative release estimated using the deconvolution method (Figure 2A). At the same time, it slowed the rate of membrane retrieval dramatically when a train of AP-like stimuli was applied (Figure 2B; n = 5 cells, see Figure S2 for a summary). In Figure 2B, the capacitance traces crossed 15 s after cessation of the stimulus. Previously, it was reported that extracellular Ca2+ is necessary for endocytosis at the frog neuromuscular junctions (Zefirov et al., 2006Zefirov A.L. Abdrakhmanov M.M. Mukhamedyarov M.A. Grigoryev P.N. The role of extracellular calcium in exo- and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles at the frog motor nerve terminals.Neuroscience. 2006; 143: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In order to confirm whether membrane retrieval at the calyx of Held is sensitive to presynaptic intracellular Ca2+, the Ca2+ chelators BAPTA or EGTA (both at 1 mM, Kd of 200 nM) were loaded into the presynaptic terminal via a recording patch pipette, while the extracellular Ca2+ concentration was returned to normal levels (2 mM). Capacitance increases in response to stimulation were much smaller under 1 mM BAPTA (70 ± 17 fF) and 1 mM EGTA (55 ± 9 fF), compared with control (237 ± 29 fF), consistent with an effect on exocytosis. However, as can be seen in Figures 3A and 3C; 1 mM BAPTA also blocked membrane retrieval (n = 5 cells). In the presence of 1 mM EGTA, endocytosis was still observed although the time course was somewhat slower than under control conditions (Figure 3B; n = 6 cells). In Figure 3C, the normalized time course of membrane retrieval under control conditions, as well as in the presence of BAPTA and EGTA, is plotted. It is clear that BAPTA blocks membrane retrieval, whereas EGTA merely slows the rate of membrane retrieval. The latter result contrasts with Sun et al., 2002Sun J.Y. Wu X.S. Wu L.G. Single and multiple vesicle fusion induce different rates of endocytosis at a central synapse.Nature. 2002; 417: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, who observed little effect of EGTA. Rates of membrane retrieval were obtained using a line fit to the capacitance decay. By dividing by the amplitude of the peak capacitance increase, rate constants were obtained. Compared with the control (0.043 ± 0.005 s−1), the endocytotic rate constants were smaller in the presence of 1 mM BAPTA (0.002 ± 0.003 s−1), whereas with 1 mM EGTA the slow-down was less pronounced (0.017 ± 0.005 s−1). The difference between BAPTA and EGTA was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Importantly, a nonspecific effect on endocytosis resulting from a block in exocytosis could be excluded, as the rate constant under control conditions was maintained (0.041 ± 0.008 s−1), even when the number of AP-like stimuli applied to the presynaptic terminal was reduced (capacitance increase of 64 ± 7 fF). Rather, these results suggest a role for intracellular Ca2+ in modulating endocytosis at the calyx of Held. Interestingly, these observations are similar to the effects of BAPTA and EGTA on transmitter release at the calyx of Held synapse (Borst and Sakmann, 1996Borst J.G. Sakmann B. Calcium influx and transmitter release in a fast CNS synapse.Nature. 1996; 383: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), where exocytosis is also much reduced in the presence of Ca2+ chelators, except that the influence on endocytosis manifests itself much later than the local Ca2+ signal is created. As BAPTA is known to bind Ca2+ ions faster than EGTA (Adler et al., 1991Adler E.M. Augustine G.J. Duffy S.N. Charlton M.P. Alien intracellular calcium chelators attenuate neurotransmitter release at the squid giant synapse.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1496-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the stronger effect of BAPTA suggests that it is local Ca2+ signals, close to Ca2+ channels, that regulate endocytosis—although EGTA also affected endocytosis, albeit less effectively. This suggests that the process of triggering endocytosis at the calyx synapse also experiences similar microdomain Ca2+, formed by multiple Ca2+ channels close to the release machinery. 5-Nitro BAPTA (1 mM), a low-affinity BAPTA-type Ca2+ chelator (Kd of 40 μM), also slowed down membrane retrieval, consistent with endocytosis being dependent on local Ca2+ (Figure S3). The above experiments indicate that endocytosis is Ca2+ dependent (Figure 2, Figure 3) and suggests that it is the local increase in Ca2+, created by the synchronous opening of multiple Ca2+ channels, that is responsible (Figure 3). In order to determine the Ca2+ dependence of the rates of membrane retrieval quantitatively, the Ca2+ uncaging technique was used to elevate Ca2+ concentration uniformly in the presynaptic terminal (Figure 4). Because the influence of Ca2+ on endocytosis manifests itself much slower than the time course of local Ca2+ signals (Figure 3), the rates of membrane retrieval can be measured after the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) decays to the basal level. This also avoids a possible balance between exo- and endocytosis during the [Ca2+]i elevation complicating interpretation of the capacitance recordings, and is in agreement with results obtained in the giant reticulospinal synapse in the lamprey (Gad et al., 1998Gad H. Löw P. Zotova E. Shupliakov D. Dissociation between Ca2+-triggered synaptic vesicle exocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosus at a central synapse.Neuron. 1998; 21: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), where it was possible to temporally dissociate the calcium influx that occurs during stimulation and exocytosis from endocytic recovery. In Figure 4A, [Ca2+]i was elevated to 10 μM, and it decayed back to the basal level within several seconds. The capacitance jump observed upon flash photolysis was 400 fF. Sometimes we saw a slow increase in capacitance for several seconds after flash photolysis as long as the [Ca2+]i was elevated (for example, in Figure 4B, [Ca2+]i decays more slowly compared with Figure 4A). This presumably reflects the release of newly recruited vesicles, which is also Ca2+ dependent. After the [Ca2+]i decay, no capacitance decay was found in Figure 4A, indicating no membrane retrieval. In contrast, when [Ca2+]i was elevated over 15 μM, a detectable capacitance decay was observed after the [Ca2+]i decayed to the basal level (Figure 4B). In the presence of AP2 blocking peptide (100 μM), membrane retrieval was not seen (Figure 4C; n = 6 cells). Figure 5 summarizes a set of the experiments shown in Figure 4, plotting the rate of membrane retrieval against the peak post-flash Ca2+-level (rate constants are given in Figure S4). Below 10 μM [Ca2+]i, almost no membrane retrieval was found. Above this level, the rate of membrane retrieval depends nonlinearly on [Ca2+]i, although below 15 μM [Ca2+]i no membrane retrie"
https://openalex.org/W1983452376,"Background As the first pathway-specific enzyme in carotenoid biosynthesis, phytoene synthase (PSY) is a prime regulatory target. This includes a number of biotechnological approaches that have successfully increased the carotenoid content in agronomically relevant non-green plant tissues through tissue-specific PSY overexpression. We investigated the differential effects of constitutive AtPSY overexpression in green and non-green cells of transgenic Arabidopsis lines. This revealed striking similarities to the situation found in orange carrot roots with respect to carotenoid amounts and sequestration mechanism. Methology/Principal Findings In Arabidopsis seedlings, carotenoid content remained unaffected by increased AtPSY levels although the protein was almost quantitatively imported into plastids, as shown by western blot analyses. In contrast, non-photosynthetic calli and roots overexpressing AtPSY accumulated carotenoids 10 and 100-fold above the corresponding wild-type tissues and contained 1800 and 500 µg carotenoids per g dry weight, respectively. This increase coincided with a change of the pattern of accumulated carotenoids, as xanthophylls decreased relative to β-carotene and carotene intermediates accumulated. As shown by polarization microscopy, carotenoids were found deposited in crystals, similar to crystalline-type chromoplasts of non-green tissues present in several other taxa. In fact, orange-colored carrots showed a similar situation with increased PSY protein as well as carotenoid levels and accumulation patterns whereas wild white-rooted carrots were similar to Arabidopsis wild type roots in this respect. Initiation of carotenoid crystal formation by increased PSY protein amounts was further confirmed by overexpressing crtB, a bacterial PSY gene, in white carrots, resulting in increased carotenoid amounts deposited in crystals. Conclusions The sequestration of carotenoids into crystals can be driven by the functional overexpression of one biosynthetic enzyme in non-green plastids not requiring a chromoplast developmental program as this does not exist in Arabidopsis. Thus, PSY expression plays a major, rate-limiting role in the transition from white to orange-colored carrots."
https://openalex.org/W2047537735,"Protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system has been shown to regulate changes in synaptic strength that underlie multiple forms of synaptic plasticity. It is plausible, therefore, that the ubiquitin proteasome system is itself regulated by synaptic activity. By utilizing live-cell imaging strategies we report the rapid and dynamic regulation of the proteasome in hippocampal neurons by synaptic activity. We find that the blockade of action potentials (APs) with tetrodotoxin inhibited the activity of the proteasome, whereas the up-regulation of APs with bicuculline dramatically increased the activity of the proteasome. In addition, the regulation of the proteasome is dependent upon external calcium entry in part through N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and requires the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Using in vitro and in vivo assays we find that CaMKII stimulates proteasome activity and directly phosphorylates Rpt6, a subunit of the 19 S (PA700) subcomplex of the 26 S proteasome.

Our data provide a novel mechanism whereby CaMKII may regulate the proteasome in neurons to facilitate remodeling of synaptic connections through protein degradation. Synaptic plasticity is a complex process that requires the selective remodeling of synaptic connections. A majority of this remodeling occurs post-synaptically, where neurotransmitter receptors, scaffold proteins, and signaling molecules are modified in response to neuronal activity (1Sheng M. Kim M.J. Science. 2002; 298: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The incorporation of newly synthesized proteins is required for long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy (2Martin K.C.

Protein degradation, on the other hand, provides an additional mechanism to modify the stoichiometry of synaptic proteins to promote, limit, or restrict plasticity.

The selective degradation of proteins via the UPS involves three steps; they are recognition of the target protein via specific signals, marking of the target protein with ubiquitin chains by ubiquitin ligases, and delivery of the target protein to the 26 S proteasome for degradation (4Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6906) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is a large energy-dependent protease consisting of two multiprotein subcomplexes; that is, the 20 S proteolytic core and 19 S cap (PA700). The 20 S consists of 28 subunits (α and β), 6 of which are catalytic, whereas the 19 S consists of Rpt (ATPase) and Rpn (non-ATPase) regulatory subunits (5Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol.

In addition, it appears that cohorts of synaptic proteins are degraded in response to chronic activity blockade or up-regulation (18Ehlers M.D. Nat.

There is increasing evidence that the proteasome may be regulated by interacting proteins or posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation or phosphorylation (23Schmidt M. Hanna J.

We utilized live-cell imaging strategies to uncover the dynamics of proteasome activity in cultured hippocampal neurons. We found that both the blockade of action potentials (APs) with tetrodotoxin (TTX) and the up-regulation of APs with bicuculline (BIC) had rapid and opposing effects on proteasome activity. In addition, increased proteasome activity was found to be dependent upon external calcium entry in part through N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and required the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). To investigate the involvement of CaMKII in proteasome regulation, we overexpressed the constitutively active CaMKII (T286D) in HEK293T cells. CaMKII robustly stimulated the activity of the proteasome. Additionally, CaMKIIα directly phosphorylated Rpt6, a 19 S proteasome subunit in vitro. Together, our data indicate proteasome function can be rapidly controlled by neuronal activity, with CaMKII as a key regulator. α2 proteasome (MCP21 monoclonal antibody (mAb)), αβ core proteasome (polyclonal antibody), and Rpt6 (mAb) antibodies were purchased from Biomol. GFP antibody (full-length, polyclonal antibody) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The following pharmacological reagents were used. 2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV), BIC, nimodipine, TTX, and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) were from Tocris Bioscience.

GFPu (in EGFP-C1 plasmid backbone; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), a fusion of the CL1 degron (degradation signal) on the carboxyl terminus of GFP, was kindly provided by Ron Kopito (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). GFPu is ubiquitinated and specifically degraded by the proteasome (27Bence N.F. Bennett E.J. Kopito R.R. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Bence N.F.

GFP-odc (in EGFP-C1 plasmid backbone; Clontech), a fusion of the ornithine decarboxylase (odc) degron on the carboxyl terminus of GFP, was also kindly provided by Ron Kopito. GFP-odc is targeted directly to the proteasome for degradation in an ubiquitin-independent manner (30Li X. Zhao X. Fang Y. Jiang X. Duong T. Fan C. Huang C.C. Kain S.R. J. Biol.

The AgeI-BsrGI fragment from photoactivatable (pa) GFP (a kind gift provided by Jennifer Lipponcott-Schwartz, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was subcloned into the AgeI-BsrGI sites of the GFP, GFPu, and GFP-odc plasmids. paGFPu, paGFP-odc, and the paGFP (no degron control) open reading frames were amplified by PCR with primers containing NheI and BamHI 5′ and 3′ overhangs, respectively. The PCR products were ligated into the NheI-BamHI sites of pCMV-IRES-mCherry. pCMV-IRES-mCherry was created by subcloning mCherry (pRSETB-mCherry; a kind gift from Roger Tsien, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA) into IRES2-EGFP (Clontech). This was done by ligating the BamHI (blunted)-BsrGI mCherry-containing fragment into BstXI (blunted)-BsrGI sites. For Sindbis virus construction, the NheI-XbaI reporter-IRES-mCherry containing fragment from pCMV-paGFP, paGFPu, and paGFP-odc plasmids were subcloned into the XbaI site of SinRep5. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For production of recombinant Sindbis virions, RNA was transcribed using the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and electroporated into baby hamster kidney cells using a BTX ECM 600 electroporator (BTX, Holliston, MA) at 220 V, 129 ohms, and 1050 microfarads. Virion were collected after 24–32 h and stored at −80 °C until use. Rat dissociated hippocampal neurons from postnatal day 1 or 2 were plated at a density of 45,000 cells/cm2 onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips or glass-bottom 35-mm dishes (Mattek, Ashland, MA) and maintained in B27-supplemented Neurobasal media (Invitrogen) for 17 days or more as previously described (32Patrick G.N. Bingol B. Weld H.A. Schuman E.M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2073-2081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). High density rat cortical or hippocampal neurons from postnatal day 1 were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well dishes (∼500,000 cells/well) and maintained in B27 supplemented Neurobasal media. For all imaging purposes, we used a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) DMI6000 inverted microscope outfitted with a Yokogawa (Tokyo, Japan) spinning disk confocal head, an Orca ER high Resolution B&W Cooled CCD camera (6.45 μm/pixel at 1×) (Hamamatsu, Sewickley, PA), Plan Apochromat 40×/1.25 NA and 63x/1.4 NA objective, and a Melles Griot (Carlsbad, CA) argon/krypton 100-milliwatt air-cooled laser for 488/568/647-nm excitations. Confocal z-stacks were acquired in all experiments. Photoactivation of reporter constructs was achieved with 100-watt Hg2+ lamp through a D405/40× excitation filter and 440 DCLP dichroic mirror (Chroma, Rockingham, VT) (10–15-s exposure times for photoactivation). For Sindbis virus infection of mature hippocampal neurons (>21 days in vitro) on glass-bottom 35-mm dishes, paGFPu, paGFP-odc, or paGFP reporter virion were added directly to culture media. Expression was allowed to continue for only 12–14 h to prevent cytotoxicity. The medium was then replaced with HEPES-based saline solution containing 119 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 30 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES with the appropriate pharmacological treatments. To determine basal rates of reporter degradation, cells were preincubated for 20 min in HEPES-based saline with either vehicle (DMSO) or proteasome inhibitors (MG132 25 μm, vinyl sulfone 1 μm, or epoxomicin 1 μm) at ∼35 °C using a ceramic heat lamp (ZooMed, San Luis Obispo, CA). The bath temperature was continually monitored by a digital probe thermometer. Infected neurons (identified by mCherry expression) were then photoactivated for 10–15 s with a 100-watt Hg2+ lamp and a D405/40× with 440 DCLP dichroic filter set (Chroma). For live imaging of neurons, the primary dendrites from pyramidal-like neurons were selected. Confocal Z-stack images (with 0.5-μm sections) were acquired with a 63× objective every 2, 3, or 4 min (as indicated) for the duration of the time lapse experiment. In some experiments (as indicated) both GFP (excitation 488 nm) and mCherry (568 nm) images were acquired. In others, GFP was acquired every time point, whereas pre- and post-mCherry time lapse images were acquired. For treatment of neurons with APV (50 μm), CNQX (40 μm), calpeptin (10 μm), KN-93 (10 μm), AIP (5 μm), or Ca2+-free containing HEPES-based saline, cells were similarly preincubated, selected by mCherry expression, photoactivated, and imaged by time-lapse microscopy. All pretreatments were for 15 min except for AIP (30 min). For treatment of neurons with TTX or BIC alone or with various combinations of other pharmacological treatments in HEPES-based saline, TTX or BIC was added to the bath after an initial 10-minute imaging period (12 min for paGFP-odc). Time lapse imaging followed for an additional 20-min period (48 min for paGFP-odc). Imaging of control and BIC-treated cells was interspersed between different treatments to verify that the degradation rates of our reporters under control and BIC-stimulated conditions in individual dendrites performed throughout the study did not vary significantly from the grouped data. All imaging was acquired in the dynamic range of 8 or 12 bit acquisition (0–255 and 0–1024 pixel intensity units, respectively) with Simple PCI (Hamamatsu) imaging software. For quantitation of reporter degradation, straightened dendrites from maximum projected confocal z-stacks were analyzed with NIH ImageJ. Images were thresholded above background. Total integrated fluorescence intensity was measured from entire (proximal and distal regions) dendrites at each time interval and expressed as the percent change from time 0. Grouped analysis of dendritic fluorescence decay over time from each treatment group is plotted as line graphs (mean ± S.E.). The degradation rate of reporter fluorescence decay is obtained by taking the difference of total fluorescence loss (arbitrary units (AU)) over time (Fi − Fn/timen) from individual experiments. The mean degradation rate ± S.E. per treated group is then divided by the control rate to obtain the “relative to control” value. In some cases the degradation rate was extracted from smaller defined time windows after the addition of activity-altering pharmacological drugs to highlight and compare dynamic changes in reporter degradation.

Open table in a new tab In vitro assay of 26 S proteasome chymotryptic activity was performed as previously described (33Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 364-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. HEK293T cells were transfected with Rous sarcoma virus CaMKII T286D for 24–36 h. Neuronal cultures were transduced with CaMKII T286D by Sindbis virus. Cells were lysed in proteasome activity assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.025% digitonin). 100 μm fluorogenic substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC was then added to lysates in a 96-well microtiter plate. Fluorescence (380-nm excitation, 460-nm emission) was monitored on a microplate fluorometer (HTS 7000 Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) every 4 min for 2 h at room temperature. HEK293T cells were transfected with CaMKII (T286D) for 24–36 h. Cultured cortical neurons or HEK293T cells were live-labeled for 2 h in a low phosphate HEPES-buffered solution (34Scholz W.K. Palfrey H.C. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2422-2432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (5.6 mm KCl, 0.2 mm KH2P04, 137.6 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.26 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) with 0.40 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate added to each well (of a 6-well culture dish). Cells were lysed in proteasome immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 15% glycerol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and resolved by SDS-PAGE. 32P labeling was detected with a Typhoon Scanner (GE Healthcare) and analyzed using ImageQuant TL (Amersham Biosciences). 19 S proteasome was purified from bovine red blood cells as described previously (35Chu-Ping M. Vu J.H. Proske R.J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PS-1 and PS-2 subcomplexes of the 19 S were purified as described previously (36Thompson D. Hakala K. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24891-24903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation reactions were conducted with autoactivated CaMKIIα. CaMKIIα was activated in reactions containing 100 μm ATP, 1.2 μm calmodulin, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, activated kinase was incubated with 19 S. Assays contained 5 μm CaMKIIα, 45 μm 19 S, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (500 mCi/m mol), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol in a final volume of 50 μl. Control reactions contained either no kinase or no 19 S. After various times of incubation at 30 °C samples were treated with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To determine the effects of neuronal activity on proteasome function, we utilized a GFP-based reporter imaging strategy to monitor the rate of proteasome activity in the dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons. GFPu is a fusion of the CL1 degron, a 16-amino acid hydrophobic sequence first identified in yeast (29Gilon T. Chomsky O. Kulka R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), with the carboxyl terminus of GFP (28Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). It has a very short half-life (<30 min) in mammalian cells and is constitutively ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (27Bence N.F. Bennett E.J. Kopito R.R. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R.

We modified GFPu by replacing GFP with a pa variant (37Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 2002; 297: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) to monitor the fluorescence decay of an isolated population of reporter proteins after photoactivation. paGFPu was expressed in mature hippocampal neurons (>21 days in vitro) for 12–14 h by Sindbis viral delivery. mCherry, a monomeric variant of red fluorescent protein (38Shaner N.C. Campbell R.E. Steinbach P.A. Giepmans B.N. Palmer A.E. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar), was simultaneously expressed by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequence to identify infected neurons before photoactivation of paGFPu (Fig. 1, A and B). After photoactivation, paGFPu fluorescence decay was monitored by confocal time-lapse imaging. paGFP (control reporter that lacks the CL1 degron) was utilized to account for the effects of diffusion and photobleaching. We found that paGFPu was rapidly degraded (as monitored by its fluorescence decay) in hippocampal dendrites (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with reported findings of GFPu degradation in mammalian cells (28Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). When paGFPu-expressing cells were treated with three different proteasome inhibitors (25 μm MG132, 1 μm vinyl sulfone, and 1μm epoxomicin), the degradation rate of paGFPu was significantly blocked to levels of paGFP, which lacked the CL1 degron (mean rates of degradation ± S.E. relative to control: MG132, 23.9 ± 16.1%; vinyl sulfone, 22.6 ± 11.9%; epoxomicin, 35.8 ± 7.4%; paGFP, 10.3 ± 10.3%; Fig. 1, C, E, and F and Table 1). We next asked what the effect of blocking APs with TTX or up-regulating APs with BIC would be on proteasome activity. After monitoring paGFPu degradation in hippocampal dendrites for a 10-min control period, BIC (40 μm final) or TTX (2 μm final) was added to the bath solution. paGFPu-expressing dendrites were then imaged for an additional 20 min (2-min intervals). Relative to control-treated neurons, BIC significantly increased the paGFPu rate of degradation (167 ± 15.2% relative to control; Fig. 1, D–F, and Table 1). The rate of paGFPu degradation in BIC-treated neurons was most pronounced within the first 10 min after the addition of BIC (233 ± 15.2% relative to control; Fig. 1F, Table 1). This effect was specific to proteasome-mediated turnover of paGFPu as the BIC-induced increase in paGFPu degradation was blocked in cells that were pretreated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (25 μm), but not with a specific calpain inhibitor, calpeptin (10 μm) (relative to BIC: MG132 + BIC, 37.9 ± 7.6%; calpeptin + BIC, 96.6 ± 9.9%; Fig. 1, D–F, Table 1). Furthermore, minimal effects of BIC were observed on the fluorescence decay of the paGFP control reporter (31.3 ± 3.0% relative to BIC; Table 1). Interestingly, we also observed in the majority of BIC-treated neurons that the highest rates of paGFPu degradation initiated and persisted in spines for more than 10 min (supplemental Movie S1). In contrast, we observed opposite effects on paGFPu degradation by AP blockade. We found the rate of paGFPu degradation to be significantly attenuated in cells that were treated with TTX (46.5 ± 4.1% relative to control; Fig. 2, D–F, Table 1). Furthermore, application of TTX rapidly increased ubiquitin conjugate levels in neurons in a manner similar to cells treated with proteasome inhibitors (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that the activity of the proteasome is rapidly tuned to increased or decreased neuronal activity. To confirm these results we utilized an additional GFP-based degradation reporter. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a well characterized cellular protein subject to ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation (31Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T.

Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fusion of amino acids 422–461 of the degradation domain of mouse ornithine decarboxylase to the carboxyl-terminal end of GFP promotes its degradation by the proteasome (30Li X. Zhao X. Fang Y. Jiang X. Duong T. Fan C. Huang C.C. Kain S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34970-34975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). As with paGFPu, we modified the GFP-odc proteasome reporter with the pa variant of GFP (37Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 2002; 297: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Degradation of paGFP-odc is independent of the ubiquitination cascade, allowing us to monitor the activity of the proteasome exclusively. We found paGFP-odc to be degraded in hippocampal dendrites in a proteasome-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B and C, supplemental Table S1). We then examined the effect of blocking or up-regulating APs on proteasome activity by monitoring the degradation of paGFP-odc. As observed with paGFPu, we found that BIC increased the rate of paGFP-odc degradation, whereas TTX significantly attenuated its degradation (BIC, 149 ± 15.6% relative to control; TTX, 11.9 ± 9.2% relative to control; Fig. 2, B–D, supplemental Table S1). The largest increase in the rate of paGFP-odc degradation occurred immediately after the addition of"

Efforts to control emerging influenza strains focus on surveillance and early diagnosis, as well as development of effective vaccines and novel antiviral drugs. Herein we document the anti-influenza activity of the anti-infective drug nitazoxanide and its active circulating-metabolite tizoxanide and describe a class of second generation thiazolides effective against influenza A virus. Thiazolides inhibit the replication of H1N1 and different other strains of influenza A virus by a novel mechanism: they act at post-translational level by selectively blocking the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin at a stage preceding resistance to endoglycosidase H digestion, thus impairing hemagglutinin intracellular trafficking and insertion into the host plasma membrane, a key step for correct assembly and exit of the virus from the host cell. Targeting the maturation of the viral glycoprotein offers the opportunity to disrupt the production of infectious viral particles attacking the pathogen at a level different from the currently available anti-influenza drugs. The results indicate that thiazolides may represent a new class of antiviral drugs effective against influenza A infection."
https://openalex.org/W1997317586,"Free fatty acids (FFA) induce hepatocyte lipoapoptosis by a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent mechanism. However, the cellular processes by which JNK engages the core apoptotic machinery during lipotoxicity, especially activation of BH3-only proteins, remain incompletely understood. Thus, our aim was to determine whether JNK mediates induction of BH3-only proteins during hepatocyte lipoapoptosis. The saturated FFA palmitate, but not the monounsaturated FFA oleate, induces an increase in PUMA mRNA and protein levels. Palmitate induction of PUMA was JNK1-dependent in primary murine hepatocytes. Palmitate-mediated PUMA expression was inhibited by a dominant negative c-Jun, and direct binding of a phosphorylated c-Jun containing the activator protein 1 complex to the PUMA promoter was identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Short hairpin RNA-targeted knockdown of PUMA attenuated Bax activation, caspase 3/7 activity, and cell death. Similarly, the genetic deficiency of Puma rendered murine hepatocytes resistant to lipoapoptosis. PUMA expression was also increased in liver biopsy specimens from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis as compared with patients with simple steatosis or controls. Collectively, the data implicate JNK1-dependent PUMA expression as a mechanism contributing to hepatocyte lipoapoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2028810361,"Learning from experience requires knowing whether a past action resulted in a desired outcome. The prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia are thought to play key roles in such learning of arbitrary stimulus-response associations. Previous studies have found neural activity in these areas, similar to dopaminergic neurons' signals, that transiently reflect whether a response is correct or incorrect. However, it is unclear how this transient activity, which fades in under a second, influences actions that occur much later. Here, we report that single neurons in both areas show sustained, persistent outcome-related responses. Moreover, single behavioral outcomes influence future neural activity and behavior: behavioral responses are more often correct and single neurons more accurately discriminate between the possible responses when the previous response was correct. These long-lasting signals about trial outcome provide a way to link one action to the next and may allow reward signals to be combined over time to implement successful learning."
https://openalex.org/W2171966548,"Dynamin-related protein (Drp) 1 is a key regulator of mitochondrial fission and is composed of GTP-binding, Middle, insert B, and C-terminal GTPase effector (GED) domains. Drpl associates with mitochondrial fission sites and promotes membrane constriction through its intrinsic GTPase activity. The mechanisms that regulate Drpl activity remain poorly understood but are likely to involve reversible post-translational modifications, such as conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins. Through a detailed analysis, we find that Drpl interacts with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 via multiple regions and demonstrate that Drpl is a direct target of SUMO modification by all three SUMO isoforms. While Drpl does not harbor consensus SUMOylation sequences, our analysis identified2 clusters of lysine residues within the B domain that serve as noncanonical conjugation sites. Although initial analysis indicates that mitochondrial recruitment of ectopically expressed Drpl in response to staurosporine is unaffected by loss of SUMOylation, we find that Drpl SUMOylation is enhanced in the context of the K38A mutation. This dominant-negative mutant, which is deficient in GTP binding and hydrolysis, does not associate with mitochondria and prevents normal mitochondrial fission. This finding suggests that SUMOylation of Drpl is linked to its activity cycle and is influenced by Drpl localization.—Figueroa-Romero, C., Iniguez-Lluhi, J.

https://openalex.org/W2104656574,"Background The regulation of energy intake is a complex process involving the integration of homeostatic signals and both internal and external sensory inputs. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of short-term overfeeding on the neuronal response to food-related visual stimuli in individuals prone and resistant to weight gain. Methodology/Principal Findings 22 thin and 19 reduced-obese (RO) individuals were studied. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed in the fasted state after two days of eucaloric energy intake and after two days of 30% overfeeding in a counterbalanced design. fMRI was performed while subjects viewed images of foods of high hedonic value and neutral non-food objects. In the eucaloric state, food as compared to non-food images elicited significantly greater activation of insula and inferior visual cortex in thin as compared to RO individuals. Two days of overfeeding led to significant attenuation of not only insula and visual cortex responses but also of hypothalamus response in thin as compared to RO individuals. Conclusions/Significance These findings emphasize the important role of food-related visual cues in ingestive behavior and suggest that there are important phenotypic differences in the interactions between external visual sensory inputs, energy balance status, and brain regions involved in the regulation of energy intake. Furthermore, alterations in the neuronal response to food cues may relate to the propensity to gain weight."
https://openalex.org/W1994325079,"Novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders comprise drug candidates designed specifically to act on multiple central nervous system targets. We have recently synthesized multifunctional, nontoxic, brain-permeable iron-chelating drugs, M30 and HLA20, possessing the A-propargylamine neuroprotective moiety of rasagiline (Azilect) and the iron-chelating moiety of VK28. The present study demonstrates that M30 and HLA20 possess a wide range of pharmacological activities in mouse NSC-34 motor neuron cells, including neuroprotective effects against hydrogen peroxide- and 3-morpholinosydnonimine-induced neurotoxicity, induction of differentiation, and up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-la and HIF-target genes (enolasel and vascular endothe-lial growth factor). Both compounds induced NSC-34 neuritogenesis, accompanied by a marked increase in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and growth-associated protein-43, which was inhibited by PD98059 and GF109203X, indicating the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase C pathways. A major finding was the ability of M30 to significantly extend the survival of G93A-SOD1 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice and delay the onset of the disease. These properties of the novel multimodal iron-chelating drugs possessing neuroprotective/ neuritogenic activities may offer future therapeutic possibilities for motor neurodegenerative diseases.— Kupershmidt, L., Weinreb, O., Amit, T., Mandel, S., Carri, M.

https://openalex.org/W1988423541,"The entorhinal cortex (EC) is regarded as the gateway to the hippocampus and thus is essential for learning and memory. Whereas the EC expresses a high density of GABA(B) receptors, the functions of these receptors in this region remain unexplored. Here, we examined the effects of GABA(B) receptor activation on neuronal excitability in the EC and spatial learning. Application of baclofen, a specific GABA(B) receptor agonist, inhibited significantly neuronal excitability in the EC. GABA(B) receptor-mediated inhibition in the EC was mediated via activating TREK-2, a type of two-pore domain K(+) channels, and required the functions of inhibitory G proteins and protein kinase A pathway. Depression of neuronal excitability in the EC underlies GABA(B) receptor-mediated inhibition of spatial learning as assessed by Morris water maze. Our study indicates that GABA(B) receptors exert a tight control over spatial learning by modulating neuronal excitability in the EC."

Mutations of human TRPML1 cause type IV mucolipidosis, a devastating pediatric neurodegenerative disease. Our recent electrophysiological studies revealed that, although a TRPML1-mediated current can only be recorded in late endosome and lysosome (LEL) using the lysosome patch clamp technique, a proline substitution in TRPML1 (TRPML1V432P) results in a large whole cell current. Thus, it remains unknown whether the large TRPML1V432P-mediated current results from an increased surface expression (trafficking), elevated channel activity (gating), or both. Here we performed systemic Pro substitutions in a region previously implicated in the gating of various 6 transmembrane cation channels. We found that several Pro substitutions displayed gain-of-function (GOF) constitutive activities at both the plasma membrane (PM) and endolysosomal membranes. Although wild-type TRPML1 and non-GOF Pro substitutions localized exclusively in LEL and were barely detectable in the PM, the GOF mutations with high constitutive activities were not restricted to LEL compartments, and most significantly, exhibited significant surface expression. Because lysosomal exocytosis is Ca2+-dependent, constitutive Ca2+ permeability due to Pro substitutions may have resulted in stimulus-independent intralysosomal Ca2+ release, hence the surface expression and whole cell current of TRPML1. Indeed, surface staining of lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (Lamp-1) was dramatically increased in cells expressing GOF TRPML1 channels.

https://openalex.org/W1972597335,"Despite the small size and conserved tertiary structure of defensins, little is known at a molecular level about the basis of their functional versatility. For insight into the mechanism(s) of defensin function, we prepared enantiomeric pairs of four human defensins, HNP1, HNP4, HD5, and HBD2, and studied their killing of bacteria, inhibition of anthrax lethal factor, and binding to HIV-1 gp120. Unstructured HNP1, HD5, and HBD3 and several other human alpha- and beta-defensins were also examined. Crystallographic analysis showed a plane of symmetry that related (L)HNP1 and (D)HNP1 to each other. Either d-enantiomerization or linearization significantly impaired the ability of HNP1 and HD5 to kill Staphylococcus aureus but not Escherichia coli. In contrast, (L)HNP4 and (D)HNP4 were equally bactericidal against both bacteria. d-Enantiomers were generally weaker inhibitors or binders of lethal factor and gp120 than their respective native, all-l forms, although activity differences were modest, particularly for HNP4. A strong correlation existed among these different functions. Our data indicate: (a) that HNP1 and HD5 kill E. coli by a process that is mechanistically distinct from their actions that kill S. aureus and (b) that chiral molecular recognition is not a stringent prerequisite for other functions of these defensins, including their ability to inhibit lethal factor and bind gp120 of HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2019205338,"Synaptic vesicle endocytosis is critical for maintaining synaptic communication during intense stimulation. Here we describe Tweek, a conserved protein that is required for synaptic vesicle recycling. tweek mutants show reduced FM1-43 uptake, cannot maintain release during intense stimulation, and harbor larger than normal synaptic vesicles, implicating it in vesicle recycling at the synapse. Interestingly, the levels of a fluorescent PI(4,5)P(2) reporter are reduced at tweek mutant synapses, and the probe is aberrantly localized during stimulation. In addition, various endocytic adaptors known to bind PI(4,5)P(2) are mislocalized and the defects in FM1-43 dye uptake and adaptor localization are partially suppressed by removing one copy of the phosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin, suggesting a role for Tweek in maintaining proper phosphoinositide levels at synapses. Our data implicate Tweek in regulating synaptic vesicle recycling via an action mediated at least in part by the regulation of PI(4,5)P(2) levels or availability at the synapse."

Two stimuli, one red and the other blue, appeared sequentially on a video screen—in either order. Later, both stimuli reappeared, and to receive a reward the monkeys had to choose the stimulus that had lasted longer during its initial presentation. Some neurons encoded stimulus duration, but a larger number of cells represented their relative duration, which was encoded in three ways: whether the first or second stimulus had lasted longer; whether the red or blue stimulus had lasted longer; or, less commonly, as the difference between the two durations. As the monkeys' choice approached, the signal encoding which stimulus (red or blue) had lasted longer increased as the order-based signal dissipated.

Temporal perception plays an important part in the life of primates, especially people. Calculations about a traffic light's duration, for example, carry as much weight as perception of its color and cognizance of the conduct it commands. Although no sensory receptors or cortical fields function solely in time perception, temporal factors underlie central aspects of perception, movement, sequences of perceptions and actions, and attempts to anticipate events. Temporal information thus transcends the sensory and motor systems of the brain. We can perceive the durations of acoustic and visual stimuli in common terms and have little difficulty integrating the times when sounds, sights, and actions occur.

Like psychophysical studies on temporal perception, several of these neurophysiological experiments—as well as the present one—involved comparing the durations of two stimuli. None of the previous studies, however, simultaneously assessed each of three issues underlying such a comparison: (1) whether frontal neurons encode the duration of each stimulus or their relative duration; (2) whether, for relative duration, frontal neurons encode which stimulus lasted longer or their difference; and (3) whether frontal neurons encode duration on the basis of the order in which stimuli appeared or on the basis of the features of a stimulus. Traditional psychophysical paradigms preclude the simultaneous assessment of these three issues because they typically involve a standard first stimulus that subjects compare with a second, variable stimulus. The present task, in contrast, allowed us to address all three issues simultaneously by freely interchanging two stimuli, their order of presentation, and their durations. Two rhesus monkeys performed a duration-discrimination task. On each trial, the monkey viewed two visual stimuli, presented sequentially on a video screen, and later pressed a switch to report which of them had lasted longer. The monkey sat before three switches within arm's reach (Figure 1A, screens 1–7). The monkey began each trial by touching the central switch, which produced a fixation spot at the center of the video screen (Figure 1A, screen 1). The monkey then fixated that spot and continued doing so until the “go” signal, much later in the trial (Figure 1A, screen 6). After fixation began and a pre-stimulus period elapsed, two visual stimuli, a blue circle and a red square, appeared in succession at the fixation point, in either order. The first stimulus, called S1, lasted 100–3200 ms (Figure 1A, screen 2). A delay period, called D1, followed (Figure 1A, screen 3). After the D1 period ended, the second stimulus (S2) appeared (Figure 1A, screen 4). Its duration always differed from that of S1 and ranged from 50–2400 ms according to two schemes, explained below. After S2, a second delay period (D2) usually followed (Figure 1A, screen 5), although in one-third of the trials no such delay occurred. The red and blue stimuli then reappeared, one to the left of the screen center, the other to the right (Figure 1A, screen 6), in either configuration. This event served as the “go” signal, and to receive a reward the monkey had to touch the switch below the stimulus that had lasted longer on that trial (Figure 1A, screen 7). Contact with the incorrect switch terminated the trial without reward. Although the monkey had 6 s to touch the left or right switch, in practice each one did so in less than 500 ms (Figure S1). Note that the monkey could not select its motor response during either the S2 or D2 period because there was no way of knowing where (left or right) the longest-lasting stimulus would appear (Figure 1A, screen 6). At those times, the monkey could decide whether the red or blue stimulus had lasted longer, but not whether a leftward or rightward hand movement should report that decision. Therefore, the neural activity recorded prior to the “go” signal could not reflect the ultimate choice of either the left versus right response target or its motor concomitants. Stimuli occurred in two sets of durations, termed the ‘square’ and “V” sets because of their appearance on scatter plots (Figure 1C). Each block of trials used one and only one stimulus set. For the set (Figure 1C, right), S2 had an equal probability of being twice or half as long as S1 for all S1 durations less than 1.6 s. This means that—except for trials with S1 durations of 1.6, 2.4, or 3.2 s—the monkeys could not predict whether S2 would be longer or shorter than S1 on the basis of S1's duration. (Although these three long S1 stimuli were used for the recording sessions, the behavioral and neurophysiological analysis presented here excluded them, which eliminated prediction or classification confounds. For example, when S1 lasted 2.4 s, the monkey could have classified S1 as “long,” predicted that S2 would be shorter, and decided on a blue or red choice before S2 appeared). A disadvantage of the V set resulted from its limited range of duration differences. The “square” set of durations (Figure 1C, left) provided that finer gradation but permitted the monkey to predict the likely relative duration of S2 prior to its occurrence. For example, when S1 lasted 400 ms, 80% of S2s lasted longer. Figure 1D shows that for each S1 duration in the square set, the probability of the monkey's reporting that S2 was longer increased with S2 duration. Overall, both monkeys performed the task accurately and had better scores and faster reaction times for easier discriminations (Figure S1). Monkey 1 performed at a mean of 81% correct for the square set of stimulus durations and 80% correct for the V set. Monkey 2 scored 80% and 77% correct, respectively. Figure S2 gives behavioral results for the V set, and Figure S3 shows fits to a psychonometric (pseudologistic) function for the square set. The neuronal sample comprised 1720 neurons: 509 from monkey 1 and 1211 from monkey 2. We used the V set of durations for 511 cells and the square set for 1209 cells. Because we used both sets for only 110 cells (6%), no separate analysis of this small subpopulation was attempted. The largest sample, 1286 cells, came from the periarcuate cortex (PA), and 434 neurons came from PFdl (Figure 1B). We measured activity during the S1 and S2 periods (from 200 ms after stimulus onset until stimulus offset, except where noted), during the D1 and D2 delay periods (from 80–400 ms after stimulus offset), and during the choice and action period (from the “go” signal until contact with a reporting switch). During the D1 period of each trial, the monkey needed to remember the duration of S1 in order to compare it later with S2. Many frontal cells encoded the duration of S1 during the latter part of the S1 period, during the D1 period, or both. In all, a quarter of the neuronal sample showed a significant effect of S1 duration on D1-period discharge rates by ANOVA (437 of 1720 cells, 25% in PA and 26% in PFdl). Figure 2 shows two examples, and Table S1 gives the breakdown by cortical area and stimulus set. To measure S1-period activity, we used trials with S1 durations of 600 ms or more in order to exclude short-latency visual responses. About a fifth of the sample showed duration effects during the last (333 ms) part of the S1 period (301 of 1720 cells, 18% in PA and 19% in PFdl). Some of the neurons selective for the duration of S1 in the D1 period also encoded its color (red or blue), as well as interactions between stimulus color and duration (Table S1). In accord with the results from ANOVA, between a fifth and a quarter of the sampled neurons had significant linear correlations between D1-period activity and S1 duration (Table S2). Duration coding during the S1 and D1 periods displayed certain systematic interrelationships. As shown in Figure 3A, neurons with activity rates that correlated positively (β > 0) with stimulus duration during the latter 333 ms of the S1 period continued that significant positive correlation into the D1 period (blue points, upper right quadrant). Figure 2A shows an example of such a neuron. Similarly, neurons with negative correlations (β < 0) between late S1-period activity and S1 duration continued to show a significant negative correlation in the subsequent D1 delay period (blue points, lower left quadrant). About a third (38%) of the cells encoding S1 duration during the D1 period also did so during the last part of the S1 period (101 of 264, 38% in PA; 38 of 104, 37% in PFdl). The discharge rates of other neurons (red points in Figure 3A) correlated with S1 duration only after its offset, and Figure 2B shows an example. Trends in S1-period activity (i.e., “declining” or “climbing” discharge rates) often predicted duration coding during the subsequent D1 period. To document this property, we calculated two indices for each neuron on the basis of a comparison of discharge rates during early (E, 200–533 ms), middle (M, 533–866 ms) and late (L, 866–1200 ms) segments of S1 periods of 1200 ms. The first index measured declines or increases from the early to the middle parts of S1 (M – E), normalized to the mean activity rate; the other measured activity trends from the middle to the late parts of S1 (L – M), normalized in the same way. Cells with negative correlations (β < 0) between D1-period activity and S1 duration (green bars) tended to have declining activity (indices < 0) during the preceding S1 period, whereas cells with positive correlations (red bars, β > 0) tended to “ramp up” their activity (indices > 0) during the S1 period (Figure 3B). The indices of the populations with positive and negative correlations (red versus green bars) differed from each other in both PA and PFdl (Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test, p < 0.001). The relatively large number of durations used for S1 allowed us to evaluate duration tuning during the D1 memory period, which we classified by the method of polynomial contrasts. This method adds power terms for the independent variable, S1 duration (d), to a model to test whether d2 and d3 factors, in that order, significantly increase the variance accounted for. Of the neurons with duration effects, 29% had a significant linear relationship without significant quadratic or cubic relations; one example is illustrated in Figure 2A. Another 26% of the duration-coding neurons had a significant quadratic relationship but not a cubic one (an example is the cell in Figure 2B), and 31% had a significant cubic regression. Table S3 gives the breakdown by cortical area and stimulus set. Thus, although many cells in the frontal cortex showed a significant linear relationship between discharge rate and stimulus duration, a larger number had better fits to nonlinear functions. Correlation coefficients for linear, quadratic, and cubic regressions were similar in PA and PFdl, accounting for 10%–25% of the variance in discharge rates (Table S4). Note that for the V distribution of stimuli (Figure 1C, right), the monkey could not predict whether an upcoming S2 stimulus would last half as long as S1 or twice as long, at least not for any of the data that contributed to the present analysis. On that basis, we can be confident that the correlations described so far reflected temporal information about S1 rather than predictions about S2, at least for the cells tested with the V distribution (see Tables S1–S3 for the numbers tested). Figure S4 illustrates this point explicitly for a PA neuron: its activity during the D1 period reflected a correlation with the duration of the previous stimulus (S1)—higher discharge rates after longer stimuli—without reference to any prediction about the upcoming one (S2). Likewise, the monkeys could not perform the task correctly by categorizing S1 as short or long. Instead, the monkeys had to remember the duration of S1 in order to compare it to an unpredictable S2 duration that came later. The finding of duration coding during the D1 period indicates that PA and PFdl neurons encoded the duration information needed for later comparison and maintained it in short-term memory. Many frontal neurons encoded the duration of the red stimulus, others encoded the duration of the blue stimulus, and still others encoded the duration of the S1 stimulus regardless of color (Table S1). During the S2 and D2 periods, many frontal neurons conveyed information about the duration of S2, and this information was often linked to color. These properties resembled the encoding of S1 duration during the S1 and D1 periods, and Figure S5 shows an example neuron. At the end of the S2 period, this cell had activity that correlated with S2 duration, and this property continued into the D2 period. Like Figure 3B for the S1 and D1 periods, Figure S6 shows for the S2 and D2 periods that neurons with climbing activity during the stimulus period had a positive correlation between activity and stimulus duration during the subsequent delay, whereas neurons with declining activity during the stimulus had a negative correlation. Although duration encoding during the S2 and D2 periods resembled that during the S1 and D1 periods, these properties were usually observed in different neurons. Only 15% of the cells that encoded S1 duration did so for S2, and only 25% of the cells that encoded S2 duration did so for S1. Along with indicating largely separate processing channels for S1 and S2 duration, this result shows that the neural activity reflecting stimulus duration in D1 and D2 did not simply reflect low-order visual responses, such as “off” responses or rebound effects, which should not differ for S1 and S2, especially when they are separated by a minimum of 400 ms (see Experimental Procedures). Table S5 shows the results of an analysis for the D2 period in the format that Table S1 uses for the D1 period. Like duration coding during the D1 period, neurons during the D2 period encoded stimulus color as well as interactions between a duration factor and color. Table S5 is not exactly analogous to Table S1, however, because the duration factor is more complex for D2 than for D1. For the square distribution of stimuli, a long S2 period meant that there was also a greater probability that S2 was the relatively longer of the two stimuli. Accordingly, some of the duration effects in Table S5 could reflect the relative duration of S1 and S2 rather than simply S2 duration. (The V distribution presented its own impediments to distinguishing stimulus-duration and relative-duration coding). In the next section, we use the square set of durations to differentiate these and other duration factors by using a multiple, stepwise-regression procedure. Relative-duration coding occurred in several forms. Most notably, many cells encoded whether the first (S1) or second (S2) stimulus had lasted longer, but not how much longer. Others encoded whether the red or blue stimulus had lasted longer, but not how much longer. Encoding of the magnitude of the difference was less common. Next, we present the results of ANOVA and multiple-regression analysis based on single-neuron data, then results for population-level measures. In the overall neuronal sample, 30% of the cells showed activity that depended on whether S1 or S2 had lasted longer, regardless of whether the red or blue stimulus had appeared first (512 of 1720 tested cells, two-way ANOVA, 30% in both PA and PFdl). Table S6 gives the breakdown by cortical area and stimulus set, and Figure 4A shows an example neuron. An additional 25% of the neuronal sample had D2-period activity that depended on whether the red or blue stimulus had lasted longer, regardless of stimulus order (431 of 1720 tested cells, 26% in PA and 23% in PFdl), and Figure 4B shows an example of that property. In addition, a substantial proportion of cells (12%–22%) showed combinations of these properties (Table S6), and Figure 5 shows an example of such a combination. This cell showed a preference for trials with a longer S2 stimulus (or, equivalently, a shorter S1 stimulus) early in the D2 period (green arrows), but ∼200 ms into the D2 period the cell switched (blue arrows) to a preference for trials with a longer blue stimulus (or a shorter red stimulus). The bars above each raster show the order and relative duration of the red square (red) and the blue circle (blue), not to scale. (A) A neuron studied with the V set of durations encoded whether S1 or S2 lasted longer, regardless of stimulus color. The cell had a significant main effect of relative duration based on stimulus order (F1,73 = 19.3; p < 0.001), but not of relative duration based on stimulus color (F1,73 = 0.032; p = 0.86) or the interaction of these two factors (F1,73 = 0.133; p = 0.72). (B) A neuron studied with the square set of stimulus durations encoded whether the red or blue stimulus had lasted longer regardless of the order of presentation. There was a significant main effect of relative duration based on stimulus color (F1,90 = 93.9; p < 0.001) but not of relative duration based on stimulus order (F1,90 = 0.001; p = 0.97) or the interaction of these two factors (F1,90 = 0.539; p = 0.46). The format is as in Figure 2 but is aligned on S2 offset, and the shading shows the measured part of the D2 period. The inclusion of only those trials with a D2 period of 400 ms or 800 ms eliminated response-related activity. This neuron encoded the relative duration on the basis of both the stimulus (i.e., whether the blue or red stimulus had lasted longer, p < 0.001) and the order of presentation (i.e., whether S2 or S1 lasted longer, p < 0.001). The time course of these two signals differed in the same way as the average ROC values shown in Figure 6F. The representation of relative duration based on stimulus order had already developed by the beginning of the D2 period (green arrows). The cell discharged more when S2 was longer (left column) than when S1 was longer (right column). The representation of relative duration based on the stimuli (red or blue) emerged later (blue arrows). By ∼200 ms after S2 offset, the neuron was more active when the blue stimulus was longer (bottom row) than when the red one was longer (top row). The format is as in Figure 2. A stepwise, multiple-regression analysis confirmed the results from ANOVA. This procedure factored out relative duration and the duration of the individual stimuli. We tested, on a cell-by-cell basis, the predictive value of four factors to evaluate whether they accounted significantly for the observed variance. (In practice, it was rare for more than one of the four factors to contribute significantly). Monte Carlo analysis evaluated whether the observed number of neurons for each factor occurred more frequently than expected by chance. One multiple regression used four temporal variables as factors: S1 duration, S2 duration, the S1-S2 difference, and whether S1 or S2 had lasted longer. The results confirmed that frontal neurons significantly (p < 0.05) encoded both the relative duration of S1 and S2 and the duration of S2 (Figure 6A). S1 duration was not significantly represented (p = 0.99 in PA and p = 0.48 in PFdl).

The orange lines indicate the p = 0.05 level as calculated with Monte Carlo analysis. (B) Number of cells showing a significant effect of the duration of the blue and red stimuli, their difference, and which one had lasted longer.

(E) ROC plots for neurons with significant relative-duration coding (including neurons encoding differences and which stimulus was longer), with the area under the ROC curve color-coded for each cell and ranked according to mean ROC values. (F) Time course of changes in mean ROC values. Background shading: one SEM. Only trials with an 800 ms D2 period, the longest interval available, were used in the ROC analysis. For comparison with ROC values during the D2 period, ROC values were also calculated for the first 200 ms of the prestimulus period and sorted on the basis of the stimuli that would later appear on each trial. Those mean ROC values (arrow) were 0.553 ± 0.002 (mean ± SEM) for whether S1 or S2 had lasted longer and 0.554 ± 0.002 for whether the red or blue stimulus had lasted longer. A similar but separate analysis was performed for four different factors: blue duration, red duration, the blue-red duration difference, and whether the blue or red stimulus lasted longer. Frontal neurons robustly encoded whether the blue or red stimulus had lasted longer, and representation of the other factors was slightly above chance level (Figure 6B). A larger, eight-factor regression model combined the two four-factor models into one and obtained comparable results (Figure S7). This similarity was to be expected because stimulus color and presentation order were orthogonal factors (e.g., a longer S1 was equally likely to have been blue or red). We also evaluated whether the coding of relative duration was better captured by the difference between the two stimuli or their ratio, and Figures S8 and S9 show that both predictors produced the similar results. As illustrated in Figure 6B, more cells encoded which stimulus (blue or red) had lasted longer than encoded their differences in duration (χ2 = 9.6, p < 0.05 in PFdl; χ2 = 47.0, p < 0.001 in PA). Similarly, as illustrated in Figure 6A, more cells encoded whether S1 or S2 had lasted longer than encoded their difference, which was a significant difference in PA (χ2 = 37.1, p < 0.001) but not in PFdl (χ2 = 1.7, p = 0.19, n.s.). An extension of the multiple-regression analysis into the choice and action period (see Figure 1A, screen 7) showed that, by this time during each trial, order-based duration coding was infrequent (Figure 6C). The encoding of blue-stimulus duration, red-stimulus duration, or their difference was also rare (Figure 6D). All of these declines, compared to results from the D2 period, reached statistical significance (χ2 test, p < 0.05), with the exception o"

The prototypic member YB-1 exhibits an exceptional high degree of phylogenetic conservation not only in the cold shock domain but also throughout the rest of the molecule.The protein may be divided into three distinct domains, the alanine/glycine/proline-rich N-terminal part, the centrally located cold shock domain, and a C-terminal region characterized by four alternating clusters of basic and acidic amino acids.

The cold shock domain contains basic and aromatic amino acids to attract nucleic acid backbones and to associate with DNA or RNA nucleotide bases.

Notch signaling imparts cell fate decisions in many tissues, including the immune system (11Maillard I. Fang T. Pear W.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 945-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and vasculo- and organogenesis in multicellular organisms (12Sestan N. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rakic P. Science. 1999; 286: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Notch receptors constitute single-pass transmembrane proteins that contain repetitive epidermal growth factor-like domain repeats (EGF) and three cysteine-rich Notch/Lin-12 repeats within their extracellular domain. The intracellular domain encompasses seven ankyrin repeats, a nuclear localization signal, transcriptional activator domain, and a PEST sequence (13Mertens P.R. Raffetseder U. Rauen T. Nephrol. Dial Transplant. 2008; 23: 2743-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Notch receptors are activated by membrane-anchored ligands, like Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged/Serrate family members, on juxtaposed cells. Upon interaction, two consecutive proteolytic cleavages (S2 and S3) liberate the intracellular Notch receptor domain (ICD), that translocates to the nucleus and acts as a trans-activator of target gene transcription by binding to the DNA-binding protein RBP-Jκ (14Bray S.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar), which in the absence of Notch ICD acts as a repressor of gene transcription (15Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors HES (Hairy Enhancer of Split) and HERP (HES-related proteins) have been depicted as immediate transcriptional targets of Notch, but an increasing number of further target genes is found.Notch signaling pathways play prominent roles in podocyte development and likely the pathogenesis of diverse glomerular diseases, like diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis (16Niranjan T.

Deletion of the Notch-2 gene or treatment of developing kidneys with γ-secretase inhibitors leads to severe defects in podocyte and proximal tubule differentiation (18Cheng H.T. Kim M. Valerius M.T. Surendran K. Schuster-Gossler K. Gossler A. McMahon A.P. Kopan R. Development. 2007; 134: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Furthermore, de novo expression of activated Notch-1 was significantly enhanced in glomerular cells in humans with diabetic nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and rodent models thereof (16Niranjan T. Bielesz B. Gruenwald A. Ponda M.P. Kopp J.B. Thomas D.B. Susztak K. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Whereas insights into the role of Notch receptors in the pathogenesis of human kidney diseases are emerging, there are strong genetic links between mutations within the human Notch-3 gene and a subtype of inherited early-onset dementia (called cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukencephalopathy, CADASIL syndrome) (19Joutel A. Corpechot C. Ducros A. Vahedi K. Chabriat H. Mouton P. Alamowitch S. Domenga V. Cécillion M. Marechal E. Maciazek J. Vayssiere C. Cruaud C. Cabanis E.A. Ruchoux M.M. Weissenbach J. Bach J.F. Bousser M.G. Tournier-Lasserve E. Nature. 1996; 383: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Two case reports provide evidence for renal involvement in CADASIL syndrome, namely the coexistence of mesangioproliferative IgA nephritis in kidney biopsies (20Guerrot D. François A. Boffa J.J.

Given the primary result yielded with the two-hybrid screen, we performed an in-depth analysis of YB-1 association with receptor Notch-3 and potential effects on Notch signaling.DISCUSSIONSecretion of a transcription factor is unexpected at first sight but not unheard of. Similarly to high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1) we determined an active secretion process for YB-1 protein via a non-classical pathway that bypasses the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus (10Frye B.C. Halfter S. Djudjaj S. Muehlenberg P. Weber S. Raffetseder U. En-Nia A. Knott H. Baron J.M. Dooley S. Bernhagen J. Mertens P.R. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In mesangial and inflammatory cells, several cytokines like PDGF-BB, interferon-γ, oxidative stress, and lipopolysaccharide were able to act as secretogogues for YB-1. These findings combined with an observed high affinity of YB-1 for the outer aspect of the cell membrane led us to a search for possible interacting proteins at the cell surface and a two-hybrid screen identified Notch-3 as an interacting protein.This initial finding was corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation and localization studies, which showed that YB-1 interacts with the Notch-3 receptor and that both proteins are found at the cell membrane. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the interaction with YB-1 is specific for the Notch-3 receptor, as it does not occur with Notch-1. This was unexpected given the high degree of structural conservation between the two receptors, i.e. the extracellular Notch-3 domains of Notch-1 and Notch-3 are 45% identical, and both are composed of a series of EGF repeats and Notch/Lin-12 repeat regions. Furthermore, Notch-1 and Notch-3 appear to behave very similarly in terms of interaction with the conventional Notch DSL ligands, i.e. Jagged1 and Delta-like-1 (35Sweeney C. Morrow D. Birney Y.A. Coyle S. Hennessy C. Scheller A. Cummins P.M. Walls D. Redmond E.M. Cahill P.A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1421-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our data show that the EGF-like repeats 13–33 in Notch-3 are sufficient for interaction with YB-1. This region lies outside the domain previously shown to be required for interaction with DSL ligands, which is confined to EGF-like repeat 11 and 12 (36Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The YB-1-interacting domain (EGF-like repeats 13–33) may also be of interest in the context of the Notch 3-associated disease CADASIL. Notch-3 mutations in CADASIL are found in the EGF-like repeats, and several of the observed mutations fall outside the region of DSL ligand interaction but within repeats 13–33, for example, the C542Y and R1006C mutations. Besides the EGF repeats necessary for direct interaction between Notch with DSL ligands, a second functional domain in EGF-repeats 24–29 has been identified in Drosophila melanogaster by a class of Notch missense mutations called Abruptex (Nax). This domain negatively regulates the interaction between Notch and DSL ligands (37de Celis J.F. Bray S.J. Development. 2000; 127: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been speculated that it may be necessary to invoke an altered response to a yet unidentified ligand or cofactor. Amino acid substitutions in this domain result in increased Notch activity, presumably by destroying the binding site of the postulated cofactor that functions as a negative regulator (37de Celis J.F. Bray S.J. Development. 2000; 127: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further investigations will be required to verify YB-1 binding to the Abruptex domain and to unravel potential modulating function(s) of YB-1 on DSL ligands.It is of note that the observed receptor activation by YB-1 occurred in the absence of DSL ligand stimulation. The finding of YB-1 as a new ligand for Notch-3 provides further evidence for the existence of “non-conventional” Notch ligands, i.e. ligands that are not part of the DSL family. It has previously been reported that F3/contactin can act as a Notch ligand to control oligodendrocyte differentiation (38Hu Q.D. Ang B.T. Karsak M. Hu W.P. Cui X.Y. Duka T. Takeda Y. Chia W. Sankar N. Ng Y.K. Ling E.A. Maciag T. Small D. Trifonova R. Kopan R. Okano H. Nakafuku M. Chiba S. Hirai H. Aster J.C. Schachner M. Pallen C.J. Watanabe K. Xiao Z.C. Cell. 2003; 115: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and the microfibrillar proteins MAGP1 and MAGP2 were shown to induce Notch-1 signaling (39Miyamoto A. Lau R. Hein P.W. Shipley J.M. Weinmaster G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10089-10097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).The Notch receptor signaling invoked by extracellular YB-1 is γ-secretase-dependent and includes HES2 promoter induction. Knowledge on HES2 promoter regulation as part of Notch signaling is rather scarce. Notch receptor-mediated induction of HES2 by membrane-bound ligand Dll4 has been reported (40Scehnet J.S. Jiang W. Kumar S.R. Krasnoperov V. Trindade A. Benedito R. Djokovic D. Borges C. Ley E.J. Duarte A. Gill P.S. Blood. 2007; 109: 4753-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and several reports indicate an active role of HES2 in proliferative processes, such as spontaneous malignant transformation of stem cells (41Shiras A. Chettiar S.T. Shepal V. Rajendran G. Prasad G.R. Shastry P. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and various tumors, e.g. of the gastrointestinal tract (42Katoh M. Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2007; 31: 461-466PubMed Google Scholar) and Ras-transformed astrocytes (43Kanamori M. Kawaguchi T. Nigro J.M. Feuerstein B.G. Berger M.S. Miele L. Pieper R.O. J. Neurosurg. 2007; 106: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). YB-1 knock-out mice exhibit neural tube defects with abnormal patterns of cell proliferation within the neuroepithelium (44Uchiumi T. Fotovati A. Sasaguri T. Shibahara K. Shimada T. Fukuda T. Nakamura T. Izumi H. Tsuzuki T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40440-40449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Given the increased HES2 transcript numbers in embryonic neural progenitor cells, one might speculate that YB-1 signaling via Notch-3 constitutes a direct link that is operative in the development of the nervous system.In the present study care was taken to unequivocally demonstrate a direct effect of YB-1 on target gene regulation via the Notch signaling cascade. To this end, two different artificial promoter elements, a concatenated CSL-binding site and a specific promoter for Notch-3 signaling linked to the luciferase gene (MH100), as well as constructs with mutated CSL-binding sites were introduced into HEK293 cells and reproducibly demonstrate activated Notch-3 signaling by extracellular YB-1.It was previously reported that Notch-3 is expressed in adult vascular smooth muscle cells (19Joutel A. Corpechot C. Ducros A. Vahedi K. Chabriat H. Mouton P. Alamowitch S. Domenga V. Cécillion M. Marechal E. Maciazek J. Vayssiere C. Cruaud C. Cabanis E.A. Ruchoux M.M. Weissenbach J. Bach J.F. Bousser M.G. Tournier-Lasserve E. Nature. 1996; 383: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar), which is in keeping with the phenotype in Notch-3-deficient mice. These mice are viable, fertile, and develop largely normally but exhibit problems of vascular smooth muscle cell maturation in distal arteries (45Joutel A. Monet M. Domenga V. Riant F. Tournier-Lasserve E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 338-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our data show that Notch-3 receptor was detected at the basal membrane of some tubular and collecting duct cells within the inner renal medulla in the adult kidney, whereas no glomerular cells were immunopositive. Subsequent to induction of mesangioproliferative Anti-Thy1.1 nephritis, Notch-3 receptor was detected within the mesangial compartment of glomeruli, and its expression peaked at a time with maximal mesangial cell proliferation rates (29Floege J. Ostendorf T. Janssen U. Burg M. Radeke H.H. Vargeese C. Gill S.C. Green L.S. Janjiæ N. Am J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and, notably, coincided temporally and spatially with increased glomerular YB-1 protein expression. The presence of cleaved extracellular domains of Notch-3 (ECN3) in the urine of diseased rats underscores its abundant expression and activation in the course of the disease. The band pattern for YB-1 in the urine was complex and included bands that correspond to full-length protein as well as protein fragments thereof. One might speculate that a high molecular mass complex of ∼90 kDa corresponds to YB-1 protein bound to albumin, given the high affinity of both proteins for each other (data not shown).20 S proteasome-mediated cleavage of YB-1 before glycine 220 has been demonstrated before (46Sorokin A.V. Selyutina A.A. Skabkin M.A. Guryanov S.G. Nazimov I.V. Richard C. Th'ng J. Yau J. Sorensen P.H. Ovchinnikov L.P. Evdokimova V. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The calculated sizes for the resultant fragments are in line with the observed band mobility (corresponding to 30 kDa) during mesangioproliferative nephritis. It will be furthermore of interest to test whether YB-1 protein fragments act differently on receptor activation.The observation of Notch-3 up-regulation as part of the inflammatory response is especially notable in light of a study providing evidence that Notch-3 receptor signaling profoundly alters intracellular signaling cascades involved in inflammatory responses, namely Jak2 activation and the subsequent STAT3 phosphorylation (47Kamakura S. Oishi K. Yoshimatsu T. Nakafuku M. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). It may, therefore, be speculated that YB-1 secretion and Notch-3 receptor expression/activation may amplify the inflammatory response of MC conferred by the Jak/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway.In sum, the data presented in this report provide evidence for a role of extracellular YB-1 as a ligand for Notch-3. This contributes to our understanding both of the repertoire of conventional and non-conventional ligands for Notch receptors and for the specificity of the individual receptor isoforms. It also highlights possible new roles of Notch and YB-1 in the inflammatory response. Ramifications of Notch-3 activation by YB-1 could be important in other processes such as stem cell maintenance, leukemogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2012745074,"Phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIMs) are key glycolipids of the mycobacterial cell envelope. They are considered not only essential structural components of the cell but also important molecules implicated in host-pathogen interactions. Although their chemical structures are well established, knowledge of the enzymes and sequential events leading to their biosynthesis is still incomplete. Here we show for the first time that although both mannosyltransferases PimA and PimB′ (MSMEG_4253) recognize phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (PI) as a lipid acceptor, PimA specifically catalyzes the transfer of a Manp residue to the 2-position of the myo-inositol ring of PI, whereas PimB′ exclusively transfers to the 6-position. Moreover, whereas PimB′ can catalyze the transfer of a Manp residue onto the PI-monomannoside (PIM1) product of PimA, PimA is unable in vitro to transfer Manp onto the PIM1 product of PimB′. Further assays using membranes from Mycobacterium smegmatis and purified PimA and PimB′ indicated that the acylation of the Manp residue transferred by PimA preferentially occurs after the second Manp residue has been added by PimB′. Importantly, genetic evidence is provided that pimB′ is an essential gene of M. smegmatis. Altogether, our results support a model wherein Ac1PIM2, a major form of PIMs produced by mycobacteria, arises from the consecutive action of PimA, followed by PimB′, and finally the acyltransferase MSMEG_2934. The essentiality of these three enzymes emphasizes the interest of novel anti-tuberculosis drugs targeting the initial steps of PIM biosynthesis. Phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIMs) are key glycolipids of the mycobacterial cell envelope. They are considered not only essential structural components of the cell but also important molecules implicated in host-pathogen interactions. Although their chemical structures are well established, knowledge of the enzymes and sequential events leading to their biosynthesis is still incomplete.

In AcxPIMy, x refers to the number of acyl groups esterified to available hydroxyls on the mannose or myo-inositol residues, and y refers to the number of mannose residues. They are based on a phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (PI) lipid anchor carrying one to six Manp residues and up to four acyl chains (for review see Refs. 1Gilleron M. Jackson M. Nigou J. Puzo G. Daffé M.

Microbiol. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Based on a conserved mannosyl-PI anchor, they are also thought to be the precursors of the two major mycobacterial lipoglycans, lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) (1Gilleron M. Jackson M.

Although the chemical structure of PIMs is now well established, knowledge of the enzymes and sequential events leading to their biosynthesis is still fragmentary. According to the currently accepted model, the biosynthetic pathway is initiated by the transfer of two Manp residues and a fatty acyl chain to PI in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Based on genetic and biochemical evidence, Korduláková et al. (5Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Jackson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31335-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) identified PimA (MSMEG_2935 in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155) as the enzyme that catalyzes the first mannosylation step of the pathway transferring a Manp residue most likely to the 2-position of the myo-inositol (myo-Ins) ring of PI. In contrast, the identity of PimB′, the enzyme responsible for the transfer of the second Manp to the 6-position of the myo-Ins ring of PIM1, still remains controversial. The Rv0557 protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (PimB; MSMEG_1113 in M. smegmatis mc2155) was originally characterized as PimB′ (7Schaeffer M.L. Khoo K.H. Besra G.S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. Belisle J.T. Inamine J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31625-31631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the lack of an Rv0557 ortholog in the genome of Mycobacterium leprae and the fact that the disruption of this gene in M. tuberculosis Erdman did not significantly affect the biosynthesis of PIMs suggest that compensatory activities exist in the bacterium or that Rv0557 serves another primary function (8Kremer L.

Somewhat supporting the latter hypothesis, the ortholog of Rv0557 in Corynebacterium glutamicum (NCgl0452, renamed mgtA) was implicated in the mannosylation of a novel glycolipid (1,2-di-O-C16/C18:1-(α-d-mannosyl)-(1→4)-(α-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-(1→3)-glycerol), and Rv0557 from M. tuberculosis was reported to functionally complement for this enzyme in a C. glutamicum knock-out mutant (10Tatituri R.V.

However, to our knowledge this mannosylated glycolipid has never been reported in mycobacteria, and it remains unclear whether PimB serves a similar physiological function in Mycobacterium spp. More recently, Lea-Smith et al. (11Lea-Smith D.J. Martin K.L. Pyke J.S. Tull D. McConville M.J. Coppel R.L. Crellin P.K. J. Biol.

Disruption of the NCgl2106 gene totally abolished Ac1PIM2 production in the mutant, arguing against the existence of a compensatory activity associated with the corynebacterial PimB enzyme. Although Ac1PIM2 production in Cg-pimB′ and Cg-pimB′/Cg-pimB knock-out mutants was restored upon complementation with the M. tuberculosis Rv2188c gene (11Lea-Smith D.J. Martin K.L. Pyke J.S. Tull D.

Moreover, in light of the recent work by Torrelles et al. (9Torrelles J.B. Desjardin L.E. MacNeil J. Kaufman T.M. Kutzbach B. Knaup R. McCarthy T.R. Gurcha S.S. Besra G.S. Clegg S. Schlesinger L.S.

Batt S. Krumbach K. Eggeling L. Besra G.S. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4465-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whether or not pimB and pimB′ could compensate for one another in mycobacteria remained open to speculation. Both PIM1 and PIM2 can be acylated with palmitate at position 6 of the Manp residue transferred by PimA by the acyltransferase MSMEG_2934 (orthologous to Rv2611c from M. tb) to form Ac1PIM1 and Ac1PIM2, respectively (13Korduláková J.

Ac1PIM2 can further be acylated at position 3 of the myo-Ins ring by an as yet unidentified acyltransferase to yield Ac2PIM2. Importantly, Ac1PIM2 and Ac2PIM2 are among the most abundant forms of PIMs found in mycobacteria and are considered both metabolic end products and intermediates in the biosynthesis of more polar forms of PIMs (PIM5 and PIM6), LM, and LAM. In this work, clear evidence is provided that PimB′ (MSMEG_4253 in M. smegmatis mc2155) is the α-ManT responsible for the biosynthesis of PIM2 from PIM1 in mycobacteria and that no other ManT can compensate for a deficiency in this enzyme in M. smegmatis. Like PimA (5Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Jackson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31335-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), PimB′ is essential to the growth of M. smegmatis. Cell-free assays using purified PimA and PimB′ and M. smegmatis membrane preparations provide new insights into the sequential events leading to the synthesis of the early forms of PIMs in mycobacteria. The M. smegmatis pimB′ gene (MspimB′, MSMEG_4253, 72% amino acid identity to Rv2188c) was amplified from genomic M. smegmatis mc2155 DNA by standard PCR using oligonucleotide primers pimB′_NdeI_Fwd (5′-GGAATTCCATATGACCCGGGTGTTGTTGGTCACC-3′, pimB′_ XhoI_Rev (5′-CCGCTCGAGCGCCTGACGCGCCTCGCGTCGG-3′), and Phusion DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs). The PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated to the corresponding restriction sites of pET29a (Novagen) generating pET29a-MspimB′. The recombinant MsPimB′ protein (385 residues) has an additional peptide of eight amino acids (386LEHHHHHH393) at the C terminus that includes a histidine tag. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells transformed with pET29a-MspimB′ were grown in 2× YT medium supplemented with 25 μg ml−1 kanamycin and 34 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol at 37 °C. MspimB′ expression was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (MP Biomedicals). After 4 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested and resuspended in solution A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Cells were disrupted by sonication (five cycles of 1 min), and the suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a HisTrap chelating column (1 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with solution B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl). The column was then washed with solution B until no absorbance at 280 nm was detected. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm imidazole in solution B at 1 ml min−1. The resulting preparation displayed a single protein band when run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (supplemental Fig. 1S). The purified enzyme was concentrated to 10 mg ml−1 in solution A containing 20% glycerol and stored at −80 °C until further use in enzyme assays. The enzymatic activity of MsPimA and MsPimB′ was monitored using a radiometric assay. The reaction mixture contained 0.0625 μCi of GDP-[C14]Man (specific activity, 305 mCi mmol−1; Amersham Biosciences), 10 μg of PI (Avanti Polar Lipids; liver PI, [M − H]−, m/z = 885.53, where the predominant species contains one polyunsaturated C20 and one C18 fatty acyl chain), 50 μg of purified MsPimA, MsPimB′, or a mix of MsPimA and MsPimB′ and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 250 μl. In some assays, membrane preparations from M. smegmatis mc2155 (0.5 mg of proteins) served as the source of lipid acceptors. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and stopped with 1.5 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, by volume). The PIM-containing organic phase was prepared and analyzed by TLC as described by Korduláková et al. (5Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Jackson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31335-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). MsPimA was purified as described previously (14Guerin M.E. Buschiazzo A. Korduláková J. Jackson M. Alzari P.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For structural analyses, 500 μm cold GDP-Man replaced GDP-[C14]Man in the assay mixture described above. The reactions were incubated overnight at 37 °C and stopped by adding 1.5 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, by volume). The nonradioactive mannolipid products from 15 reactions were isolated by preparative TLC as described (5Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Jackson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31335-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Compounds 1–5 were mixed with an equal volume of matrix (2,5-dihydroxylbenzoic acid dissolved in 10 mg ml−1 acetonitrile/water, 50:50, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), and the molecular mass was measured in the negative ion mode by MALDI-TOF MS on a Bruker Ultraflex TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). External calibration was performed using an eight component calibration mixture on a spot adjacent to the sample. One-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C in a Varian Inova 500-MHz NMR spectrometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) using an HCN probe head equipped with shielded z-gradient. Samples were dissolved in 0.6 ml of CHCl3/CD3OD (2:1, by volume) and spectra acquired using a 5-mm NMR probe. Typical parameters used for one-dimensional 1H experiments were as follows: sweep width, 5500Hz; flip angle, 45°; time domain data points, 32,768; number of transients, 32 or 256; and relaxation delay, 1.5 s. For the complete structural analysis of PIM1, PIM2, and Ac1PIM2, two-dimensional experiments, including gradient-selected correlation spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy, and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation spectroscopy were carried out. Parameters used for two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy and total correlation spectroscopy were as follows: sweep width, 5500 Hz in both F2 and F1 dimensions; time domain data points, 2048; number of free induction decay with t1 increment, 512; number of transients, 32 or 256; and relaxation delay, 1.5s. Parameters used for heteronuclear single quantum coherence and heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy were as follows: sweep width, 5500 Hz in F2 and 30,188 Hz in F1; time domain data points, 2048; number of free induction decays with t1 increment, 256; number of transients, 32 or 256; and relaxation delay, 1.5 s. The acquired NMR data were processed using the TOPSPIN 2.1 software (Bruker GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). Essentially the same strategy was used to construct a conditional MspimB′ mutant of M. smegmatis as was used earlier to generate an MspimA conditional mutant (5Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K.

The M. smegmatis MspimB′ gene (MSMEG_4253) and flanking regions were amplified from genomic M. smegmatis mc2155 DNA by standard PCR strategies using oligonucleotide primers MspimB′_KO_ApaI_fwd (5′-ATAATGGGCCCGCAAAACTGCGTGACCTGTACG-3′) and MspimB′_KO_SpeI_rev (5′-ATTATACTAGTGACCTCGGCGCCATCGACG-3′), and Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). A disrupted allele of MspimB′, MspimB′::km, was constructed by cloning the kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4K (GE Healthcare) into the AgeI and StuI sites of MspimB′, generating a 363-bp deletion within the coding sequence of MspimB′. MspimB′::km was then ligated to pJQ200xylE to yield pJQMspimB′KX, the vector used to achieve allelic replacement at the MspimB′ locus (5Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J.

Sequence alignment was carried out manually to match functionally conserved residues, predicted secondary structures, and hydrophobicity profiles. Secondary structures were predicted using the Jpred program (18Cuff J.A. Barton G.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The models were assessed by the VERIFY_3D program. With the goal of determining the function of the mycobacterial PimB′ enzyme, a recombinant form of the M. smegmatis protein (MsPimB′) with a C-terminal histidine tag was produced in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified to near homogeneity (supplemental Fig. 1S). As had been the case with the M. tuberculosis PimA protein earlier (5Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Jackson M. J. Biol.

ManT assays were then run using different combinations of the purified MsPimA and MsPimB′ enzymes. When commercial liver PI and GDP-[14C]Man served as the acceptor and donor substrates in the assay, purified MsPimA (14Guerin M.E. Buschiazzo A. Korduláková J. Jackson M. Alzari P.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) catalyzed the formation of PIM1 (mannolipid 1, Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, the formation of a 14C-labeled mannolipid with an Rf similar to that of PIM1 was also observed when purified MsPimB′ was used as the source of enzyme in the assay (mannolipid 2, Fig. 1). To further characterize mannolipids 1 and 2, nonradioactive products were purified by preparative TLC from reaction mixtures in which cold GDP-Man replaced GDP-[C14]Man. MALDI-TOF-MS analyses in the negative ion mode confirmed compounds 1 ([M − H]−, m/z = 1047.60) and 2 ([M − H]−, m/z = 1047.65) as PIM1 molecules (the [M − H]− m/z value of the commercial liver PI is 885.53) (supplemental Fig. 2S). MsPimB′ thus has the ability in vitro to transfer Manp from GDP-Man onto PI, generating PIM1. A combination of one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR was then used to determine the position at which the Manp residues were attached to myo-Ins in mannolipids 1 and 2 (for details see supplemental material and supplemental Figs. 3S–6S) (19Gilleron M. Nigou J. Cahuzac B. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2147-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Gilleron M. Ronet C. Mempel M. Monsarrat B. Gachelin G. Puzo G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 29880-29889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 2, the 1H NMR spectra of mannolipid 1 shows one peak at 5.14 ppm assigned to the α-anomeric proton of the Manp residue attached to position 2 of myo-Ins. The 1H and 13C chemical shift values of mannolipid 3 is exactly comparable with that of mannolipid 1, and therefore compound 3 was also assigned to 2-linked PIM1. In the spectra of compound 2, the peak at 5.072 ppm was assigned as the α-anomeric proton of the Manp residue attached to position 6 of myo-Ins. The 1H NMR spectra of mannolipid 4 shows two distinct peaks at 5.129 and 5.046 ppm assigned to α-anomeric protons of two Manp residues attached to the 2- and 6-positions of myo-Ins. For the first time, direct evidence arising from the use of purified enzymes was thus provided that MsPimA catalyzes the transfer of a Manp residue from GDP-Manp to the 2-position of the myo-Ins ring of PI, and MsPimB′ catalyzes the transfer of a Manp residue to the 6-position. The simultaneous addition of purified MsPimA and MsPimB′ (1:1, w/w) to the reaction mixture described above yielded two products, mannolipid 3 and mannolipid 4 (Fig. 1). MALDI-TOF-MS analyses in the negative ion mode confirmed compound 3 ([M − H]−, m/z = 1047.60) as PIM1 and compound 4 as PIM2 ([M − H]−, m/z = 1209.71) (supplemental Fig. 2S). From this experiment, it can thus be concluded that MsPimA and MsPimB′ are sufficient for the formation of PIM2 from PI and GDP-Man to occur. The fact that no PIM3 or more mannosylated products were formed in the reaction even after prolonged incubation times further indicated that MsPimA and MsPimB′ are unable to mannosylate PIM products beyond PIM2. Thus MsPimA and MsPimB′ appear to each catalyze the transfer of one single Manp residue. To determine the sequence of the reactions leading to the formation of PIM2, two independent assays were carried out in which purified MsPimA and MsPimB′ were added sequentially to the reaction mixture. In one of the assays, MsPimA was added first to a reaction mixture containing PI and GDP-[C14]Man. After 2 h of incubation, one-half of the reaction was stopped by the addition of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1), and the other half was incubated at 60 °C for 15 min to inactivate the enzyme. Purified MsPimB′ was then added to the heat-inactivated assay mixture, and the reaction allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. In the second assay, MsPimB′ was added first to the reaction mixture, then inactivated as described above, and MsPimA finally added. That both MsPimA and MsPimB′ were inactivated by heat treatment was verified by running independent assays with each of the purified enzymes (supplemental Fig. 7S). Consistent with our previous results, both MsPimA and MsPimB′ catalyzed the transfer of a Manp residue from GDP-Man to PI to form PIM1 (Fig. 3A). The subsequent addition of MsPimB′ to the MsPimA reaction mixture clearly led to the synthesis of 14C-labeled PIM2 (Fig. 3A). In striking contrast, the addition of MsPimA to the MsPimB′ reaction mixture only resulted in the stimulation of PIM1 production with no detectable formation of PIM2 (Fig. 3A). We thus conclude from this experiment that although MsPimB′ recognizes the PIM1 product of MsPimA (with an α-1,2-linked Manp residue on the myo-Ins ring; Fig. 2) as an acceptor substrate, MsPimA is unable to transfer a Manp residue onto a PIM1 product bearing an α-1,6-linked Manp residue. With the transfer of Manp from GDP-Man onto PI catalyzed by MsPimB′ occurring 53 times slower than both the MsPimA-dependent transfer of Manp onto PI and the MsPimB′-dependent addition of Manp onto PIM1 (Fig. 3, B and C), it is clear that the different activities of the two enzymes with PI and, subsequently, PIM1 acceptors dictate the order in which the mannosylation of PI and PIM is to occur under physiological conditions. In further support of this assumption, the PIM1 product (mannolipid 3, Fig. 1) formed in a competition assay, where equal amounts of MsPimA and MsPimB′ were used as enzyme sources, exclusively consisted of α-1,2-linked Manp residues, as opposed to the expected mixture of α-1,2- and α-1,6-linked Manp residues if both enzymes had transferred Manp onto PI with comparable efficiencies (Fig. 2). When membranes prepared from M. smegmatis mc2155 were used as a source of phospho(glyco)lipid acceptor, the addition of purified MsPimA clearly stimulated the synthesis of PIM1, accompanied by the accumulation of small amounts of Ac1PIM1 (Fig. 4, lane 2). The addition of MsPimB′ to the membrane preparations, in contrast, led to an even greater accumulation of a compound (mannolipid 5) with Rf properties similar to that of Ac1PIM2 (Fig. 4, lane 4). MALDI-TOF MS and NMR analyses confirmed the identity of this product as Ac1PIM2 containing two C16 and one C19 fatty acyl chains ([M − H]−, m/z = 1413.88) (supplemental Fig. 2S) (21Gilleron M. Quesniaux V.F. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29880-29889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), among which two fatty acyl chains are carried by the glycerol moiety and one acyl chain is attached to Manp residue located at position 2 of the myo-Ins ring (supplemental Fig. 8S). The acylation of the Manp residue transferred by PimA is thought to result from the action of the acyltransferase encoded by MSMEG_2934 in M. smegmatis mc2155 (13Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Puzo G.

Overall, the abundant de novo synthesis of Ac1PIM2 in the assay mixture containing purified MsPimB′ (Fig. 4, lane 4) suggests that significant amounts of PIM1 are available in the membranes of M. smegmatis or that the synthesis of this acceptor substrate is stimulated by the addition of purified MsPimB′ to the reaction mixture. This observation and the fact that radiolabeled Ac1PIM2 was on the contrary not detectable in the assay mixture in which only purified MsPimA was added (Fig. 4, lane 2) suggest that the physiological amounts of MsPimB′ present in the membranes of M. smegmatis may be rate-limiting in the formation of PIM2/Ac1PIM2. On the other hand, with almost all of the PIM2 product of MsPimB′ being instantly converted to Ac1PIM2 (Fig. 4, lane 4), the activity of the acyltransferase does not seem to be limiting in the membranes of M. smegmatis. In fact, saturation of this enzyme only became clearly visible when both purified MsPimA and MsPimB′ were added to the reaction mixture,"
https://openalex.org/W2130494719,"Mammalian CD38 and its Aplysia homolog, ADP-ribosyl cyclase (cyclase), are two prominent enzymes that catalyze the synthesis and hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a Ca(2+) messenger molecule responsible for regulating a wide range of cellular functions. Although both use NAD as a substrate, the cyclase produces cADPR, whereas CD38 produces mainly ADP-ribose (ADPR). To elucidate the catalytic differences and the mechanism of cyclizing NAD, the crystal structure of a stable complex of the cyclase with an NAD analog, ribosyl-2'F-2'deoxynicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (ribo-2'-F-NAD), was determined. The results show that the analog was a substrate of the cyclase and that during the reaction, the nicotinamide group was released and a stable intermediate was formed. The terminal ribosyl unit at one end of the intermediate formed a close linkage with the catalytic residue (Glu-179), whereas the adenine ring at the other end stacked closely with Phe-174, suggesting that the latter residue is likely to be responsible for folding the linear substrate so that the two ends can be cyclized. Mutating Phe-174 indeed reduced cADPR production but enhanced ADPR production, converting the cyclase to be more CD38-like. Changing the equivalent residue in CD38, Thr-221 to Phe, correspondingly enhanced cADPR production, and the double mutation, Thr-221 to Phe and Glu-146 to Ala, effectively converted CD38 to a cyclase. This study provides the first detailed evidence of the cyclization process and demonstrates the feasibility of engineering the reactivity of the enzymes by mutation, setting the stage for the development of tools to manipulate cADPR metabolism in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2000029548,"Tumor hypoxia is relevant for tumor growth, metabolism and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We report that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment induced mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in a dimetyl-α-benzantracene induced mammary rat adenocarcinoma model, and the MET was associated with extensive coordinated gene expression changes and less aggressive tumors. One group of tumor bearing rats was exposed to HBO (2 bar, pO2 = 2 bar, 4 exposures à 90 minutes), whereas the control group was housed under normal atmosphere (1 bar, pO2 = 0.2 bar). Treatment effects were determined by assessment of tumor growth, tumor vascularisation, tumor cell proliferation, cell death, collagen fibrils and gene expression profile. Tumor growth was significantly reduced (∼16%) after HBO treatment compared to day 1 levels, whereas control tumors increased almost 100% in volume. Significant decreases in tumor cell proliferation, tumor blood vessels and collagen fibrils, together with an increase in cell death, are consistent with tumor growth reduction and tumor stroma influence after hyperoxic treatment. Gene expression profiling showed that HBO induced MET. In conclusion, hyperoxia induced MET with coordinated expression of gene modules involved in cell junctions and attachments together with a shift towards non-tumorigenic metabolism. This leads to more differentiated and less aggressive tumors, and indicates that oxygen per se might be an important factor in the “switches” of EMT and MET in vivo. HBO treatment also attenuated tumor growth and changed tumor stroma, by targeting the vascular system, having anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects."
https://openalex.org/W1978432820,"Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates macrophages by interacting with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and triggers the production of various pro-inflammatory Th1 type (type 1) cytokines such as IFNgamma, TNFalpha, and IL8. Though some recent studies cited macrophages as potential sources for Th2 type (type 2) cytokines, little however is known about the intracellular events that lead to LPS-induced type 2 cytokines in macrophages. To understand the mechanisms by which LPS induces type 2 cytokine gene expression, macrophages were stimulated with LPS, and the expression of IL-4 and IL-5 genes were examined. LPS, acting through TLR4, activates both type 1 and type 2 cytokine production both in vitro and in vivo by using macrophages from C3H/HeJ or C3H/HeOuJ mice. Although the baseline level of both TNFalpha and IL-4 protein was very low, TNFalpha was released rapidly after stimulation (within 4 h); however, IL-4 was released after 48 h LPS stimulation in secreted form. Silencing of myeloid differentiation protein (MyD88) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), using small interfering RNA abolished IL-4 induction induced by LPS whereas silencing of TRAM has no effect on TNFalpha induction, thereby indicating that LPS-induced TNFalpha is MyD88-dependent but IL-4 is required both MyD88 and TRAM. These findings suggest a novel function of LPS and the signaling pathways in the induction of IL-4 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2159683333,"Phospholemman (PLM) phosphorylation mediates enhanced Na/K-ATPase (NKA) function during adrenergic stimulation of the heart. Multiple NKA isoforms exist, and their function/regulation may differ. We combined fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and functional measurements to investigate isoform specificity of the NKA-PLM interaction. FRET was measured as the increase in the donor fluorescence (CFP-NKA-alpha1 or CFP-NKA-alpha2) during progressive acceptor (PLM-YFP) photobleach in HEK-293 cells. Both pairs exhibited robust FRET (maximum of 23.6 +/- 3.4% for NKA-alpha1 and 27.5 +/- 2.5% for NKA-alpha2). Donor fluorescence depended linearly on acceptor fluorescence, indicating a 1:1 PLM:NKA stoichiometry for both isoforms. PLM phosphorylation induced by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C activation drastically reduced the FRET with both NKA isoforms. However, submaximal cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation had less effect on PLM-NKA-alpha2 versus PLM-NKA-alpha1. Surprisingly, ouabain virtually abolished NKA-PLM FRET but only partially reduced co-immunoprecipitation. PLM-CFP also showed FRET to PLM-YFP, but the relationship during progressive photobleach was highly nonlinear, indicating oligomers involving >or=3 monomers. Using cardiac myocytes from wild-type mice and mice where NKA-alpha1 is ouabain-sensitive and NKA-alpha2 is ouabain-resistant, we assessed the effects of PLM phosphorylation on NKA-alpha1 and NKA-alpha2 function. Isoproterenol enhanced internal Na(+) affinity of both isoforms (K((1/2)) decreased from 18.1 +/- 2.0 to 11.5 +/- 1.9 mm for NKA-alpha1 and from 16.4 +/- 2.5 to 10.4 +/- 1.5 mm for NKA-alpha2) without altering maximum transport rate (V(max)). Protein kinase C activation also decreased K((1/2)) for both NKA-alpha1 and NKA-alpha2 (to 9.4 +/- 1.0 and 9.1 +/- 1.1 mm, respectively) but increased V(max) only for NKA-alpha2 (1.9 +/- 0.4 versus 1.2 +/- 0.5 mm/min). In conclusion, PLM associates with and modulates both NKA-alpha1 and NKA-alpha2 in a comparable but not identical manner."
https://openalex.org/W2081717058,"Aldosterone and endothelin-1 (ET-1) act on collecting duct cells of the kidney and are important regulators of renal sodium transport and cardiovascular physiology. We recently identified the ET-1 gene (edn1) as a novel aldosterone-induced transcript. However, aldosterone action on edn1 has not been characterized at the present time. In this report, we show that aldosterone stimulated edn1 mRNA in acutely isolated rat inner medullary collecting duct cells ex vivo and ET-1 peptide in rat inner medulla in vivo. Aldosterone induction of edn1 mRNA occurred in cortical, outer medullary, and inner medullary collecting duct cells in vitro. Inspection of the edn1 promoter revealed two putative hormone response elements. Levels of heterogeneous nuclear RNA synthesis demonstrated that edn1 mRNA stimulation occurred at the level of transcription. RNA knockdowns corroborated pharmacological studies and demonstrated both mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor participated in this response. Aldosterone resulted in dose-dependent nuclear translocation and binding of mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor to the edn1 hormone response elements. Hormone receptors mediated the association of chromatin remodeling complexes, histone modification, and RNA polymerase II at the edn1 promoter. Direct interaction between aldosterone and ET-1 has important implications for renal and cardiovascular function."
https://openalex.org/W2090762008,"The double-headed arrowhead protease inhibitors API-A and -B from the tubers of Sagittaria sagittifolia (Linn) feature two distinct reactive sites, unlike other members of their family. Although the two inhibitors have been extensively characterized, the identities of the two P1 residues in both API-A and -B remain controversial. The crystal structure of a ternary complex at 2.48 A resolution revealed that the two trypsins bind on opposite sides of API-A and are 34 A apart. The overall fold of API-A belongs to the beta-trefoil fold and resembles that of the soybean Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors. The two P1 residues were unambiguously assigned as Leu(87) and Lys(145), and their identities were further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Reactive site 1, composed of residues P5 Met(83) to P5' Ala(92), adopts a novel conformation with the Leu(87) completely embedded in the S1 pocket even though it is an unfavorable P1 residue for trypsin. Reactive site 2, consisting of residues P5 Cys(141) to P5' Glu(150), binds trypsin in the classic mode by employing a two-disulfide-bonded loop. Analysis of the two binding interfaces sheds light on atomic details of the inhibitor specificity and also promises potential improvements in enzyme activity by engineering of the reactive sites."
https://openalex.org/W2098408481,"To reduce the increasing amount of time spent on literature search in the life sciences, several methods for automated knowledge extraction have been developed. Co-occurrence based approaches can deal with large text corpora like MEDLINE in an acceptable time but are not able to extract any specific type of semantic relation. Semantic relation extraction methods based on syntax trees, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and the interpretation of the generated trees is difficult. Several natural language processing (NLP) approaches for the biomedical domain exist focusing specifically on the detection of a limited set of relation types. For systems biology, generic approaches for the detection of a multitude of relation types which in addition are able to process large text corpora are needed but the number of systems meeting both requirements is very limited. We introduce the use of SENNA (""Semantic Extraction using a Neural Network Architecture""), a fast and accurate neural network based Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) program, for the large scale extraction of semantic relations from the biomedical literature. A comparison of processing times of SENNA and other SRL systems or syntactical parsers used in the biomedical domain revealed that SENNA is the fastest Proposition Bank (PropBank) conforming SRL program currently available. 89 million biomedical sentences were tagged with SENNA on a 100 node cluster within three days. The accuracy of the presented relation extraction approach was evaluated on two test sets of annotated sentences resulting in precision/recall values of 0.71/0.43. We show that the accuracy as well as processing speed of the proposed semantic relation extraction approach is sufficient for its large scale application on biomedical text. The proposed approach is highly generalizable regarding the supported relation types and appears to be especially suited for general-purpose, broad-scale text mining systems. The presented approach bridges the gap between fast, co-occurrence-based approaches lacking semantic relations and highly specialized and computationally demanding NLP approaches."

A key question was therefore whether the major pseudopilin GspG also requires a special feature to obtain sufficient stability to perform its function. The gene fragment corresponding to the soluble domain of V. cholerae GspG (residues 26–137) was cloned into a pCDFDuet-1-based vector (Novagen) for expression with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells were grown in Luria broth at 37 °C and induced for 3 h with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C. GspG was purified from the soluble fraction of the lysed cells using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) followed by His tag cleavage with tobacco etch virus protease, an ion-exchange purification step using a 30Q column (GE Healthcare), and a final size exclusion on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) for both ion-exchange peaks. After dialysis against 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, crystals were obtained only for the first ion-exchange peak. The optimized crystals were grown using the vapor diffusion method in 22.5% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 0.04 m zinc acetate. The crystals diffracted to ∼4 Å initially. After two cycles of crystal annealing by blocking the cryo-stream, the resolution limit improved to 2.5 Å, and a preliminary data set was collected in-house (supplemental Table 1).

The initial model was improved using ARP/wARP (28Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and finalized using manual rebuilding in Coot (29Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23384) Google Scholar) alternating with refinement by REFMAC5 (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) using one TLS group per chain. From subsequent tests, it appeared that the structure could have been solved ab initio using the zinc anomalous signal. The two monomers in the asymmetric unit (ASU) form an antiparallel dimer with two Zn2+ ions in the interface and a third Zn2+ ion participating in crystal contact with a symmetry-related molecule (Fig. 1). The two monomers superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 0.4 Å over 112 Cα atoms. The gene fragments corresponding to the soluble domains of V. vulnificus GspG (residues 26–137) and EHEC GspG (residues 17–136) were cloned into a pCDFDuet-1-based vector similar to V. cholerae GspG. The expression was performed as for V. cholerae GspG, except that Luria broth was supplemented with 1 mm calcium chloride, but no calcium chloride was added during subsequent purification and crystallization. The purification followed the procedure outlined for V. cholerae GspG with the first ion-exchange peak used for crystallization. Crystals of V. vulnificus GspG were grown using the vapor diffusion method in 1.95 mdl-malic acid, pH 5.0. A data set was collected at beamline BL9-2 at SSRL (supplemental Table 1). Data were processed using XDS (31Kabsch W. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3232) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (25McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14559) Google Scholar) using the V. cholerae GspG structure as a model. After manual rebuilding in Coot (29Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23384) Google Scholar), the three monomers in the ASU were refined with REFMAC5 (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) using three TLS groups per chain as defined by the TLSMD server (32Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). The three subunits in the ASU superimpose pairwise with an r.m.s.d. of 0.2–0.4 Å over 111 Cα atoms. The V. vulnificus GspG structures superimpose onto the V. cholerae GspG structures with an r.m.s.d. of 0.6–0.8 Å over 111 Cα atoms and 91% sequence identity in the superimposed region. A cluster of crystals was obtained during screening in a condition containing 1.0 m sodium citrate, 0.1 m CHES, pH 9.5. An individual crystal was separated from the cluster, frozen, and used for data collection. Data were collected at beamline BL9-2 at SSRL and processed using XDS (31Kabsch W. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3232) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (25McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14559) Google Scholar) using the V. cholerae GspG structure, with the Ca2+-binding loop and C-terminal α-helix removed, as a search model. The two monomers in the ASU were rebuilt using ARP/wARP (28Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and finalized using Coot (29Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). The two subunits in the ASU superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 2.0 Å over 114 Cα atoms. Large differences occur only in the N-terminal region where helix α1 unwinds. The exclusion of residues 18–29 from the superimposition reduces the r.m.s.d. to 0.5 Å. Superimposition onto the V. cholerae GspG structure gives an r.m.s.d. of 1.9–2.1 Å over 105 Cα atoms with 65% sequence identity in the superimposed region. The ΔgspG strain and the complementing pMMB67EH-gspG plasmid were constructed as described previously (33Sikora A.E. Lybarger S.R. Sandkvist M. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8484-8495Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced in gspG gene with QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using pMMB-gspG as a template. Primers used for the site change in gspGD116A and gspGD127A were 5′-gttcaccttaggtgcggccggtcaagaaggtggtg-3′, 3′-caagtggaatccacgccggccagttcttccaccac-5′, 5′-gaaggtaccggtgccgctatcggtaactgg-3′, and 3′-cttccatggccacggcgatagccattgacc-5′, respectively. gspGD116AD127A was then constructed using pMMB-gspGD116A as a template and the above primers specific for the gspGD127A site change. All mutations were verified by sequencing. Cultures were grown overnight in Luria broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml thymine and 200 μg/ml carbenicillin and centrifuged to separate the supernatant and cellular material. The supernatants were centrifuged once more, and the protease activity was measured as described previously (4Johnson T.L. Abendroth J. Hol W.G. Sandkvist M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 255: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown to mid-log phase. Whole cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cells in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 50 mm dithiothreitol and boiling for 5 min. 10 μl of A600 = 1.0 was loaded onto NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen). Following electrophoresis and immunoblotting, GspG was detected with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against V. cholerae GspG, kindly supplied by Dr. Michael Bagdasarian, Michigan State University, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad), and ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare). Typhoon Trio variable mode imager system and ImageQuant software were used for imaging. The soluble domain of the V. cholerae GspG double D116A/D127A mutant (residues 26–137) was expressed and purified similar to the wild-type protein. A single peak was obtained after the ion-exchange step. The thermal stability of proteins was measured by fluorescence using SYPRO Orange as fluorophore as described elsewhere (34Lo M.C. Aulabaugh A. Jin G. Cowling R. Bard J. Malamas M. Ellestad G. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 332: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), without additives, in the presence of 1 mm calcium chloride or in the presence of 1 mm EDTA. Four independent values were measured for each condition. The melting temperature (Tm) of wild-type GspG was 50.0 ± 1.0, 56.2 ± 0.3, and 40.1 ± 0.4 °C for no additive, calcium chloride, and EDTA conditions, respectively. Tm values for the double D116A/D127A mutant were 46.4 ± 0.6, 46.4 ± 0.5, and 46.2 ± 0.4 °C for no additive, calcium chloride, and EDTA conditions, respectively. Multiple sequence alignments were made using ClustalW2 (35Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). ESPript (36Gouet P. Robert X. Courcelle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3320-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar) was applied to render the alignments. The figures were generated using PyMOL (37DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). We solved the crystal structures of V. cholerae, V. vulnificus, and EHEC GspGs, all to better than 2.0 Å resolution, yielding a total of seven views of these three GspG molecules (supplemental Table 1, Figs. 1 and 2, and supplemental Fig. 2). All these structures largely agree with the structure of K. oxytoca GspG and show the typical pilin fold composed of an N-terminal α-helix, a “variable segment,” and a C-terminal β-sheet. However, we consistently found two additional structural features that have not been described previously. First, the C-terminal residues in all new GspG structures adopt a helical conformation (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 and supplemental Fig. 2), in contrast with a β-strand observed in K. oxytoca GspG. In the latter structure, a β-strand swap occurred between the two pseudopilin molecules in the asymmetric unit (13Köhler R. Schäfer K. Müller S. Vignon G. Diederichs K. Philippsen A. Ringler P. Pugsley A.P. Engel A. Welte W. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 647-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Second, a distinct high electron density is present in each of the two subunits of the V. cholerae GspG structure, surrounded by the carboxylates of Asp-116 and Asp-127 and by four main chain carbonyl oxygens (from Leu-113, Gln-118, Gly-120, and Gly-125) in an octahedral manner. The high density of the peak (Fig. 1B) and the all-oxygen sphere of ligands provided initial evidence that the ion bound is a calcium ion. Additional evidence that the two ions located in the β2-β3 loop are calcium ions is: (i) the anomalous difference maps using the λ = 0.97946 Å data reveal 4.7 and 3.6 σ peaks (Fig. 1B) at the Ca2+-binding sites, which is proportional to the 22.5 and 20.3 σ peaks at the zinc positions with full occupancy, because the f″ = 0.56 electrons for Ca2+ and the f″ = 2.48 electrons for Zn2+ at this wavelength; (ii) the anomalous difference maps in the λ = 1.28344 Å data set show 7.3 and 5.3 σ peaks at the two Ca2+-binding sites when compared with the 12.8 and 8.0 σ peaks at the zinc positions with full occupancy, which agrees with the f″ = 0.93 electrons for Ca2+ and the f″ = 1.21 electrons for Zn2+ at this wavelength; (iii) refinement as calcium ions at full occupancy yields temperature factors for the cations of 26.5 Å2 in chain A and 48.7 Å2 in chain B, which are close to the average temperature factors of 27.7 and 49.1 Å2, respectively, for the coordinating oxygen atoms. The structure determinations of V. vulnificus and EHEC GspG were undertaken to evaluate the presence of Ca2+ ions across the GspG family. In the V. vulnificus structure, the calcium-binding regions of the three independent subunits have higher B factors than the rest of the structure, yet the evidence of calcium binding is clear. The anomalous difference maps (supplemental Fig. 2C), using the λ = 1.5418 Å data, reveal 12.9, 9.7, and 5.0 σ peaks at the Ca2+-binding sites in chains A, B, and C, respectively, corresponding with the f″ of 1.29 electrons for Ca2+ at this wavelength. The side chain of Asp-116 in chain C swings out of the Ca2+-binding site to participate in a water-mediated crystal contact. Based on the values of anomalous peaks, we refined the Ca2+ ion in chain C at 50% occupancy. Refinement of the calcium ions yields temperature factors of 70.6 Å2 in chain A, 79.2 Å2 in chain B, and 87.3 Å2 in chain C, which are close to the average temperature factors of 66.6, 78.1, and 78.6 Å2, respectively, for the coordinating atoms. The amino acid sequences of GspGs from EHEC and K. oxytoca align well mutually but display distinct sequence variation in the Ca2+-binding region when compared with those of V. cholerae and V. vulnificus GspGs. The latter proteins have an insert of three residues, forming helix α3 in the Vibrio GspG structures, between the two conserved calcium-coordinating aspartates (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1). Nevertheless, in the EHEC GspG structure, both subunits show a high electron density consistent with Ca2+ binding in essentially the same position as in V. cholerae and V. vulnificus GspG. The temperature factors for the metal ions with full occupancy are 34.2 Å2 in chain A and 27.6 Å2 in chain B, which are close to the average temperature factors of 21.2 and 18.7 Å2, respectively, for the coordinating atoms. The charged ligands of the EHEC calcium site are Asp-117 and Asp-125, which are structurally equivalent to Asp-116 and Asp-127 of V. cholerae GspG, with as new ligand the hydroxyl of Thr-122 and with the carbonyl oxygens of Pro-114 and Val-119 completing the plane of a trigonal bipyramidal coordination (Fig. 2B). The all-oxygen coordination of the ion site is in agreement with Ca2+ binding. The GspG family sequence alignment (supplemental Fig. 1) indicates that the two Ca2+-coordinating aspartates are conserved, are rarely a Glu, and only in Legionella pneumophila is one an alanine (not shown). Note also how the Thr/Ser presence in the Ca2+-binding site correlates consistently with the omission of three residues, forming the V. cholerae GspG helix α3, in the β2-β3 loop. There appear therefore to be two subclasses of major pseudopilins. One is a Vibrio-like subclass, with four main chain carbonyl oxygen calcium-binding ligands plus two carboxylate ligands and a short helix α3 between the two carboxylate-providing amino acids. The second is the EHEC-like subclass, with two main chain calcium-binding ligands, one Thr/Ser side chain oxygen ligand plus two carboxylate ligands, and no helix between the two carboxylate-providing amino acids. It is most likely that K. oxytoca GspG belongs to the latter subclass and that the β-strand swap in the crystal structure (13Köhler R. Schäfer K. Müller S. Vignon G. Diederichs K. Philippsen A. Ringler P. Pugsley A.P. Engel A. Welte W. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 647-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) disrupted the calcium-binding site. The functional importance of Ca2+ coordination by GspG was assessed by replacing the highly conserved residues Asp-116 and Asp-127 in V. cholerae GspG with alanines and monitoring the effect on extracellular secretion of protease by V. cholerae. No protease secretion was observed when plasmid-encoded GspG-D116A/D127A was expressed in a mutant strain lacking GspG (Fig. 3), indicating that the simultaneous removal of the two aspartate carboxylates prevents T2SS function by impairing Ca2+ binding. The singly substituted variants, GspG-D116A and GspG-D127A, remained functional (Fig. 3A), presumably because either carboxylate in conjunction with the main chain carbonyls from Leu-113, Gln-118, Gly-120, and Gly-125 is still capable of Ca2+ binding. Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts from the ΔgspG mutant strain showed that the single and the double mutant variant proteins were expressed at levels similar to that of wild-type GspG (Fig. 2A). We also measured thermal stability of the wild-type and the double D116A/D127A mutant GspG using a fluorescence-based thermal shift assay (34Lo M.C. Aulabaugh A. Jin G. Cowling R. Bard J. Malamas M. Ellestad G. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 332: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 38Matulis D. Kranz J.K. Salemme F.R. Todd M.J.

Salemme F.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 2001; 6: 429-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and found that the mutant is slightly less stable than wild-type GspG, with a Tm of 46.4 °C versus 50.0 °C. Interestingly, the stability of the double mutant was unaffected by adding Ca2+ or EDTA, whereas the stability of the wild-type protein increased substantially upon adding Ca2+ (Tm 56.2 °C) and decreased upon adding EDTA (Tm 40.1 °C). These studies clearly indicate that altering the coordinating aspartates of the Ca2+ site in V. cholerae GspG dramatically impairs the functioning of the T2SS. The loss of calcium binding by GspG could influence protein secretion by the T2SS in a number of ways, for instance by possibly promoting a conformation of the C-terminal helix conducive for favorable interactions in the pseudopilus (supplemental Fig. 3). It appears that three major fibrous arrangements used by bacterial secretion systems are dependent on entirely different stabilizing features: disulfide bridges in the type 4 pilins (21Hansen J.K. Forest K.T. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 11: 192-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), isopeptide bonds in the thin fibers of Gram-positive bacteria (23Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and calcium ions in the pseudopilus of the T2SS (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Intriguingly, an unrelated dinuclear calcium site is observed and conserved in the tip pseudopilin GspK (17Korotkov K.V. Hol W.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Hence, the T2SS is dependent on calcium binding in multiple ways.

https://openalex.org/W2042845766,"Epirubicin has been widely used for chemotherapeutic treatment of gastric cancer; however, intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance remains an obstacle to successful management. The mechanisms underlying epirubicin resistance are still not well defined. Here we report the construction and application of a partially randomized retrovirus library of 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> small interfering RNAs to identify novel genes whose suppression confers epirubicin resistance in gastric cancer cells SGC7901. From 12 resistant cell colonies, two small interfering RNAs targeting <i>GAS1</i> (growth arrest-specific 1) and <i>PTEN</i> (phosphatase and tensin homolog), respectively, were identified and validated. We identified a previously unrecognized chemoresistance role for GAS1. <i>GAS1</i> suppression resulted in significant epirubicin resistance and cross-resistance to 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin in various gastric cancer cell lines. <i>GAS1</i> suppression promoted multidrug resistance through apoptosis inhibition, partially by up-regulating the Bcl-2/Bax ratio that was abolished by <i>Bcl-2</i> inhibition. <i>GAS1</i> suppression induced chemoresistance partially by increasing drug efflux in an ATP-binding cassette transporter and drug-dependent manner. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) but not MRP-1 were up-regulated, and targeted knockdown of P-gp and BCRP could partially reverse <i>GAS1</i> suppression-induced epirubicin resistance. Verapamil, a P-gp inhibitor, could reverse P-gp substrate (epirubicin) but not non-P-gp substrate (5-fluorouracil and cisplatin) resistance in <i>GAS1</i>-suppressed gastric cancer cells. BCRP down-regulation could partially reverse 5-fluorouracil but not cisplatin resistance induced by GAS1 suppression, suggesting 5-fluorouracil but not cisplatin was a BCRP substrate. These results suggest that GAS1 might be a target to overcome multidrug resistance and provide a novel approach to identifying candidate genes that suppress chemoresistance of gastric cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2147801901,"It is becoming increasingly evident that histone deacetylases (HDACs) have a prominent role in the alteration of gene expression during the growth remodeling process of cardiac hypertrophy. HDACs are generally viewed as corepressors of gene expression. However, we demonstrate that class I and class II HDACs play an important role in the basal expression and up-regulation of the sodium calcium exchanger (Ncx1) gene in adult cardiomyocytes. Treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) prevented the pressure-overload-stimulated up-regulation of Ncxl expression. Overexpression of HDAC5 resulted in the dose-dependent up-regulation of basal and a-adrenergic stimulated Ncx1 expression. We show that Nkx2.5 recruits HDAC5 to the Ncx1 promoter, where HDAC5 complexes with HDAC1. Nkx2.5 also interacts with transcriptional activator p300, which is recruited to the Ncxl promoter. We demonstrate that when Nkx2.5 is acetylated, it is found associated with HDAC5, whereas deacetylated Nkx2.5 is in complex with p300. Notably, TSA treatment prevents p300 from being recruited to the endogenous Ncx1 promoter, resulting in the repression of Ncx1 expression. We propose a novel model for Ncx1 regulation in which deacetylation of Nkx2.5 is required for the recruitment of p300 and results in up-regulation of exchanger expression.—Chandrasekaran, S., Peterson, R.

https://openalex.org/W2001094827,"JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) is essential for cytokine receptor signaling, and several lines of evidence support a causal role of an activating JAK2 mutation in myeloproliferative disorders. JAK2 activity is autoinhibited by its pseudokinase domain in the basal state, and the inhibition is released by cytokine stimulation; how engagement of the cognate receptor triggers this release is unknown. From a functional screen for gain-of-function JAK2 mutations, we discovered 13 missense mutations, nine in the pseudokinase domain and four in the Src homology 2 (SH2)-pseudokinase domain linker. These mutations identified determinants for autoinhibition and inducible activation in JAK2. Two of the mutants, K539I and N622I, resulted in erythrocytosis in mice. Scanning mutagenesis of the SH2-pseudokinase domain linker indicated that its N-terminal part was essential for interaction of JAK2 with the Epo receptor, whereas certain mutations in the C-terminal region conferred constitutive activation. We further showed that substitutions for Glu543-Asp544 in this linker or Leu611, Arg683, or Phe694 in the hinge proximal region of the pseudokinase domain resulted in activated JAK2 mutants that could not be further stimulated by Epo.

Binding of JAK2 through its N-terminal segment to the EpoR is essential for EpoR surface expression (9Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The pseudokinase domain is predicted to adopt a kinase fold but lacks residues essential for catalysis (10Boudeau J. Miranda-Saavedra D. Barton G.J. Alessi D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 443-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Deletion of the pseudokinase domain leads to a marked increase in JAK2 kinase activity and loss of response to cytokine stimulation (11Saharinen P. Silvennoinen O. J. Biol.

Therefore, this domain is essential for JAK2 autoinhibition and is essential for JAK2 activation upon cytokine stimulation. Consistent with this notion, a point mutation in the JAK2 pseudokinase domain was identified in the majority of myeloproliferative disorder patients, including 90% of polycythemia vera (PV) patients (14James C.

Recently, mutations immediately adjacent to the JAK2 pseudokinase domain in the SH2-pseudokinase domain linker were identified in PV patients and shown to cause constitutive activation of JAK2 and a PV-like phenotype in mice (24Scott L.M.

Leukemia. 2008; 22: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the control of JAK2 activity (i.e. the swift augmentation of its activity upon receptor activation) are poorly understood. The residues involved in the autoinhibition in JAK2 are unknown. In this work, we sought to characterize the regulatory mechanisms controlling JAK2 kinase activity. Using a functional screen for activating JAK2 mutations that signal constitutively, we discovered 13 mutations in the pseudokinase domain and in the SH2-pseudokinase domain linker. These mutations identified specific residues that are important for the inhibition of basal JAK2 kinase activity and for cytokine-induced JAK2 activation. In addition, we showed that the SH2-pseudokinase domain linker is essential for interaction with the EpoR, autoinhibitory regulation, and Epo-inducible JAK2 activation and may act as a switch in relaying cytokine receptor engagement to JAK2 activation by flexing the pseudokinase domain hinge. For the JAK2 mutant library, murine JAK2 cDNA was subcloned into retroviral vector pEYK3.1 to generate pEYK3.1-JAK2. cDNAs of wild-type or HA-tagged murine JAK2, JAK2 mutants, or JAK2 domains were subcloned into pMX-IRES-CD4, pMX-IRES-GFP, or the pEBG vector that expresses GST upstream (9Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). HA-tagged or V5-tagged domains of JAK2 were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. All mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. Antibodies were from the following sources: HA (Covance); phosphotyrosine 4G10, JAK2, phospho-JAK2, and GST (Millipore); phospho-STAT5, phospho-ERK, AKT, and phospho-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology); V5 (Invitrogen); STAT5 and ERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). HA affinity resin was from Roche Applied Science. Glutathione Sepharose 4B, horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, and the ECL chemiluminescence system were from Amersham Biosciences. Interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, and murine stem cell factor were from PeproTech. pEYK3.1-JAK2 was used as a template for library construction. Two methods were used to generate the JAK2 mutant library. In one method, we used XL-1 Red (Stratagene), a bacterial strain deficient in three major pathways for DNA repair. pEYK3.1-JAK2 was transformed into XL-1 Red, and colonies were collected from bacterial plates and propagated for 14 h at 30 °C in LB broth supplemented with antibiotics. Randomly mutated plasmids were isolated and used to generate retroviruses to infect Ba/F3 cells (9Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In the other method, random mutagenesis of the SH2 and pseudokinase domains of JAK2 was performed by error-prone PCR using the Gene Morph II Kit (Stratagene). The manufacturer's conditions for generation of one or two mutations per molecule were used. Two PCRs were used, since shorter products have higher ligation efficiency into pEYK3.1 than do longer ones. The region encompassing the SH2 and pseudokinase domains (residues 393–840) was mutagenized. An internal XhoI site exists at residue 393 of JAK2. An NcoI site was engineered at residue 717, and a BamHI site was engineered at residue 840. One PCR product spanned residues 393–717, whereas the other spanned residues 717–840. PCR products were digested with XhoI/NcoI or NcoI/BamHI and subcloned into pEYK3.1-JAK2 to replace the corresponding region. Ligated products were transformed into Escherichia coli strain ElectroMAX Stbl4 (Invitrogen). Transformants (1.2 × 105) were selected on Zeocin agar plates. Bacterial colonies were collected, and plasmid DNA was isolated. Retroviruses were produced in HEK293T cells and used to infect Ba/F3 cells. The infected Ba/F3 cells were incubated for 16 h and then washed with RPMI media containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Cells (2.5 × 105/well) were plated in 6-well plates in RPMI media with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.24% agar. After 10 days, isolated colonies were picked and amplified in liquid culture as described (27Azam M. Raz T. Nardi V. Opitz S.L. Daley G.Q. Biol. Proced. Online. 2003; 5: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated, and integrated provirus was recovered (28Koh E.Y. Chen T. Daley G.Q. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e142Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Retroviruses were generated from rescued genomic DNAs and used in the second round of screening. Plasmids from the second round of screening were sequenced. Clones harboring multiple mutations were further dissected by examining each mutation individually. To build a structure model of the JAK2 pseudokinase domain, JAK2 sequence homologs were collected using PSI-BLAST (29Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59923) Google Scholar) (default values, gi|2499668 as a query). Sequences that included all domains found in Jak2 (FERM, SH2, pseudokinase, and kinase) fell into four orthologous groups in vertebrates that included JAK2, JAK1, JAK3, and TYK2. These sequences were aligned using MAFFT (30Katoh K. Misawa K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3059-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (9472) Google Scholar) to define residue conservations and hydrophobicity profiles for use in refining alignments to structure templates. Appropriate structure templates were identified using 3D-Jury consensus of fold prediction metaserver results (31Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) for the mouse Jak2 query sequence (gi|2499668). Initial alignments produced by fold prediction servers to two top-scoring templates (Protein Data Bank codes 1opl and 1k9a) were adjusted manually based on 3D-Jury consensus alignments, secondary structure assignments, hydrophobicity profiles, and residue conservations. Based on the resulting alignments, models for the JAK2 sequence (gi|2499668, range 525–815) were built using the alignment mode (1opl_A, 1opl_B, and 1k9a_A) of the SWISS-MODEL workspace (32Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6039) Google Scholar, 33Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4506) Google Scholar) combined with the Swiss-PdbViewer (34Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9587) Google Scholar). Alignment of the JAK2 sequence insert regions were further refined using the most favorable reported final energies of the models (e.g. 1oplA, −10967 kJ/mol). The final model depicting the JAK2 pseudokinase domain was based on the autoinhibited c-Abl tyrosine kinase structure, which also includes an N-terminal SH2 domain not modeled here. Ba/F3 or Ba/F3-EpoR cells stably expressing JAK2 constructs at a predetermined level were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting based on CD4 (9Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To examine factor-independent growth, cells were washed extensively in RPMI medium with 1% bovine serum albumin and then grown in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum without IL-3. HA-tagged or untagged JAK2 and JAK2 mutants were expressed in the pRK5 or pcDNA3.1 vectors. γ2A cells transiently transfected with wild-type or JAK2 mutants were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. The lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies to phospho-JAK2 or JAK2. Bound antibodies were detected by the ECL chemiluminescence system after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. For immunoprecipitations, HA-tagged JAK2 or JAK2 mutants were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA affinity resin. The precipitates were eluted with SDS sample buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-phospho-JAK2 or monoclonal antibodies to HA. To determine stimulation by Epo, wild-type or JAK2 mutants were transiently expressed in γ2A cells with the EpoR. After 48 h, cells were starved for 2 h and then stimulated with 40 units/ml Epo for 7 min. Lysates were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-JAK2 antibodies. To examine the ability of a fragment of JAK2 containing the SH2 and pseudokinase domains to inhibit JAK2 kinase domain in trans, the fragment was expressed as HA-tagged protein in pcDNA3.1. Mutations were generated in this background. Two concentrations of wild-type or mutant HA-JAK2(SH2+pseudo) were transiently co-expressed with V5-tagged JAK2 kinase domain, JAK2(K)-V5, in HEK293T cells. Lysates from these cells were immunoblotted with antibodies to phospho-JAK2, V5, or HA. To examine signaling, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing EpoR together with wild-type or mutant JAK2s were starved in RPMI containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 4 h (35Constantinescu S.N. Huang L.J. Nam H. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cells expressing wild-type JAK2 were stimulated with Epo (100 units/ml) for 7 min as a positive control. The cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. The lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies to phospho-STAT5, phospho-ERK, phospho-AKT, STAT5, ERK, or AKT. HA-tagged JAK2 proteins were immunoprecipitated using HA affinity resin. Immunoprecipitants were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in kinase buffer supplemented with 100 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and phosphatase and protease inhibitors. A peptide derived from STAT5 (AKAADGY694VKPQIKQVV) containing the JAK2 phosphorylation site was used as a substrate at 1 mm. Kinase reactions were stopped at 30 min, a time within the linear reaction range, by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Samples were then boiled at 98 °C for 5 min, separated on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Typhoon Trio scanning (Amersham Biosciences). HA-tagged EpoR surface expression was measured in the presence of wild-type or mutant full-length JAK2 or GST-JAK2(N) constructs in half a million γ2A cells, as described previously (36Tong W. Sulahian R. Gross A.W. Hendon N. Lodish H.F. Huang L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38930-38940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Murine JAK2 or JAK2 mutants were expressed in MSCV-IRES-GFP. Retroviral supernatants were generated from HEK293T cells as described (9Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To transduce murine bone marrow cells, 5-fluorouracil (150 mg/kg) was injected intravenously into 6-week-old BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories). After 5 days, marrow cells were harvested by flushing the femurs and tibias, and cells were cultured overnight in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 6 ng/ml IL-3, 10 ng/ml IL-6, and 10 ng/ml murine stem cell factor in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were subsequently transduced by spin infection (1800 × g, 90 min, 33 °C) with retroviral particles in the presence of Polybrene (10 μg/ml) 24 h before and again on the day of transplantation on RetroNectin-coated plates. Transduced bone marrow cells were washed twice and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells (0.5 × 106) were injected into the lateral tail vein of lethally irradiated (2 × 450 centigrays) BALB/c recipient mice (7–8 weeks old; Charles River Laboratories). Blood counts were determined by analysis of retro-orbital blood samples anti-coagulated with potassium EDTA (Antech Diagnostics). An unpaired Student's t test was used to compare peripheral blood counts among recipients of bone marrow cells expressing wild-type or mutant JAK2. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Substituting Val617 with several residues other than Phe did not constitutively activate JAK2 (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, residues in addition to Val617 are critical for maintenance of JAK2 in the inactive state. We chose to identify activating residues using a functional screen. Overexpression of the constitutively activated JAK2V617F at high levels in the IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 leads to factor-independent growth (19Lu X. Huang L.J. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5258-5266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We therefore expressed a library of JAK2 mutants in Ba/F3 cells and isolated those that grew in the absence of IL-3. After two rounds of selection, we identified 14 distinct amino acid substitutions at 12 residues in JAK2 that conferred factor-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells. IL-3-independent growth was verified in Ba/F3 cells stably expressing these mutants at similar expression levels, and cells expressing vector alone or wild-type JAK2 died within 48 h (supplemental Fig. S2). These mutations are located either in the pseudokinase domain like V617F or in the linker region between the SH2 and pseudokinase domains. Specifically, R588M, S591L, K607E, L611S, V617F, V617I, N622I, R683S, F694L, and F694S reside in the pseudokinase domain, whereas N531I, M535I, H538L, and K539I are located in the SH2-pseudokinase linker (Fig. 1). All of these residues are conserved between murine and human JAK2 with one exception; position 531 is Asn in mouse and His in human JAK2. None of the mutations corresponds to any known JAK2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. To date, a three-dimensional structure is available for the JAK2 kinase domain (37Lucet I.S. Fantino E. Styles M. Bamert R. Patel O. Broughton S.E. Walter M. Burns C.J. Treutlein H. Wilks A.F. Rossjohn J. Blood. 2006; 107: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) but not the entire protein. We therefore performed homology-based molecular modeling of the JAK2 pseudokinase domain to help us visualize the location of the activating mutations. Our model (Fig. 1B) differs only slightly from a previous model (38Giordanetto F. Kroemer R.T. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The 12 critical residues identified in our screen map to the SH2-pseudokinase linker (N531I, M535I, H538L, and K539I), the same pseudokinase domain surface as V617F (R588M, S591L, V617F, V617I, and N622I), or the pseudokinase domain hinge-proximal region (K607E, L611S, R683S, F694L, and F694S). To characterize these JAK2 mutants, we first examined their autophosphorylation activity. HA-tagged wild-type or mutant JAK2 proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. After immunoprecipitation with HA affinity resin, the precipitants were run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed using antibodies that recognize JAK2 phosphorylated on Tyr1007 and Tyr1008. A kinase-deficient mutant JAK2 in which Lys882 is replaced by Glu, JAK2(KD), was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 2A, JAK2 mutants except for R588M and S591L showed a higher level of autophosphorylation than wild-type JAK2. These results were confirmed with untagged versions of these mutants in γ2A cells that do not express endogenous JAK2 (data not shown). To examine the ability of these mutants to phosphorylate exogenous substrates, HA-tagged JAK2 proteins were incubated with a peptide substrate derived from STAT5 in in vitro kinase assays. Compared with wild-type JAK2, JAK2 mutants phosphorylated the STAT5 peptide to a much higher level (Fig. 2B). Although R588M and S591L had little detectable autophosphorylation, they conferred IL-3-independent Ba/F3 growth (supplemental Fig. S2) and had a reproducible albeit modest increase in kinase activity compared with wild-type JAK2 in in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 2B). They may hyperactivate JAK2 to a lesser extent than the other mutations. We next assessed whether these JAK2 mutants could constitutively activate downstream signaling in hematopoietic cells. Co-expression of a cytokine receptor scaffold, such as the EpoR, is necessary for JAK2V617F to recruit downstream signaling molecules (19Lu X. Huang L.J. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5258-5266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Lu X. Levine R. Tong W. Wernig G. Pikman Y. Zarnegar S. Gilliland D.G. Lodish H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18962-18967Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We thus examined signaling in Ba/F3 cells that stably co-expressed the EpoR and JAK2 mutants. The STAT5, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathways were examined. In contrast to cells expressing wild-type JAK2, cells expressing the majority of JAK2 mutants showed constitutive activation of STAT5, ERK, and AKT after IL-3 deprivation for 4 h (Fig. 2C). Therefore, JAK2 mutants we identified were constitutively active and could constitutively activate downstream signaling pathways. For the majority of JAK2 mutants, autophosphorylation correlated with in vitro kinase activity and downstream signaling; however, there was some discordance between the results of different methods. L611S was heavily autophosphorylated but caused poor STAT5 phosphorylation in Ba/F3-EpoR cells. K607E and F694S had similar kinase activity values but different phosphorylation levels of downstream signaling proteins in Ba/F3-EpoR cells. One reason for these discrepancies may be that for autophosphorylation and in vitro kinase assays, wild-type or mutant JAK2 was expressed and examined in the absence of cytokine receptors, whereas downstream signaling of these JAK2 proteins was determined in Ba/F3-EpoR cells where the EpoR was overexpressed. Signaling measured in Ba/F3-EpoR cells most likely originated from a EpoR-JAK2 complex. L611S and K607E may affect the conformation of JAK2 such that they are less efficient in phosphorylating substrates (e.g. EpoR cytoplasmic tyrosines and/or STAT5) in the context of an EpoR-JAK2 complex, resulting in lower phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins. In addition, differences in assay sensitivity may play a role in these discrepancies. The pseudokinase domain inhibits activity of the JAK2 kinase domain in trans (12Saharinen P. Takaluoma K. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3387-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism underlying our activating mutations, we first tested an HA-tagged JAK2 fragment encompassing the SH2 domain, the SH2-pseudokinase linker, and the pseudokinase domain for its ability to inhibit JAK2 kinase domain in trans. Since some of the activating mutations were found in the SH2-pseudokinase linker, we included the SH2 domain in hopes of preserving the conformation of the linker"
https://openalex.org/W1977593159,"Contamination of litter in a broiler grow-out house with Salmonella prior to placement of a new flock has been shown to be a precursor of the flock's Salmonella contamination further down the production continuum. In the southern USA, broiler grow-out houses are primarily built on dirt pad foundations that are placed directly on top of the native soil surface. Broiler litter is placed directly on the dirt pad. Multiple grow-out flocks are reared on a single litter batch, and the litter is kept in the houses during downtime between flocks. The effects of environmental determinants on conditions in broiler litter, hence Salmonella ecology within it, has received limited attention. In a field study that included broiler farms in the states of Alabama, Mississippi and Texas we assessed Salmonella in broiler litter at the end of downtime between flocks, i.e. at the time of placement of a new flock for rearing. Here we utilized these results and the U.S. General Soil Map (STATSGO) data to test if properties of soil at farm location impacted the probability of Salmonella detection in the litter. The significance of soil properties as risk factors was tested in multilevel regression models after accounting for possible confounding differences among the farms, the participating broiler complexes and companies, and the farms' geographical positioning. Significant associations were observed between infiltration and drainage capabilities of soil at farm location and probability of Salmonella detection in the litter."
https://openalex.org/W2024512790,"Import of exogenous plasmid DNA (pDNA) into mammalian cell nuclei represents a key intracellular obstacle to efficient non-viral gene delivery. This includes access of the pDNA to the nuclei of non-dividing cells where the presence of an intact nuclear membrane is limiting for gene transfer. Here we identify, isolate, and characterize, cytoplasmic determinants of pDNA nuclear import into digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells. Depletion of putative DNA-binding proteins, on the basis of their ability to bind immobilized pDNA, abolished pDNA nuclear import supporting the critical role of cytoplasmic factors in this process. Elution of pDNA-bound proteins, followed by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis identified several candidate DNA shuttle proteins. We show that two of these, NM23-H2, a ubiquitous c-Myc transcription-activating nucleoside diphosphate kinase, and the core histone H2B can both reconstitute pDNA nuclear import. Further, we demonstrate a significant increase in gene transfer in non-dividing HeLa cells transiently transfected with pDNA containing binding sequences from two of the DNA shuttle proteins, NM23-H2 and the homeobox transcription factor Chx10. These data support the hypothesis that exogenous pDNA binds to cytoplasmic shuttle proteins and is then translocated to the nucleus using the minimal import machinery. Importantly, increasing the binding of pDNA to shuttle proteins by re-engineering reporter plasmids with shuttle binding sequences enhances gene transfer. Increasing the potential for exogenously added pDNA to bind intracellular transport cofactors may enhance the potency of non-viral gene transfer. Import of exogenous plasmid DNA (pDNA) into mammalian cell nuclei represents a key intracellular obstacle to efficient non-viral gene delivery. This includes access of the pDNA to the nuclei of non-dividing cells where the presence of an intact nuclear membrane is limiting for gene transfer. Here we identify, isolate, and characterize, cytoplasmic determinants of pDNA nuclear import into digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells. Depletion of putative DNA-binding proteins, on the basis of their ability to bind immobilized pDNA, abolished pDNA nuclear import supporting the critical role of cytoplasmic factors in this process. Elution of pDNA-bound proteins, followed by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis identified several candidate DNA shuttle proteins. We show that two of these, NM23-H2, a ubiquitous c-Myc transcription-activating nucleoside diphosphate kinase, and the core histone H2B can both reconstitute pDNA nuclear import. Further, we demonstrate a significant increase in gene transfer in non-dividing HeLa cells transiently transfected with pDNA containing binding sequences from two of the DNA shuttle proteins, NM23-H2 and the homeobox transcription factor Chx10. These data support the hypothesis that exogenous pDNA binds to cytoplasmic shuttle proteins and is then translocated to the nucleus using the minimal import machinery. Importantly, increasing the binding of pDNA to shuttle proteins by re-engineering reporter plasmids with shuttle binding sequences enhances gene transfer. Increasing the potential for exogenously added pDNA to bind intracellular transport cofactors may enhance the potency of non-viral gene transfer. Gene therapy is a rational candidate for the treatment of monogenic disorders such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Given the need for lifelong treatment, and the difficulties with readministration of viral vectors, non-viral approaches are being actively pursued. A number of hurdles to efficient gene transfer using this approach have been identified. These include access of the plasmid DNA (pDNA) 3The abbreviations used are: pDNAplasmid DNACFTRCF transmembrane conductance regulatorNPCnuclear pore complexHSAhuman serum albuminFITCfluorescein-5-isothiocyanatePNApeptide nucleic acidWGAwheat germ agglutininNLSnuclear localizing signalsCLSMconfocal laser scanning microscopyIPGimmobilized pH gradientIEFisoelectric focusingMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flightPMFpeptide mass fingerprintingMS/MStandem mass spectrometryHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatographyFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingpIisoelectric pointsNHEnuclease-hypersensitive element. to the nuclei of terminally differentiated airway epithelial cells (1Nishikawa M.

The transport of macromolecules across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and into the nucleus is now well understood. The NPC is a highly selective channel allowing only the passive diffusion of molecules less than Mr ∼40–60 kDa (8–9 nm). Facilitated transport of larger cargo molecules is mediated by nuclear-localizing signals (NLSs), and multiple families of soluble cognate transport factors. The latter include members of the importin-β/karyopherin-β superfamily that play a pivotal role in transporting cargo that carries classical NLSs as well as cargo with no obvious NLS. In the best understood pathway, importin-β specifically recognizes the NLS-containing import substrate proteins by means of the adapter molecule importin-α. The importin-α/β complex then translocates across the NPC via an as yet poorly understood energy-dependent mechanism, controlled by the nucleotide state of the Ras family GTPase Ran (2Görlich. D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). As with many other essential cellular processes, the nuclear import machinery is highly redundant and a plethora of importin-α and -β receptor proteins are able to recognize and facilitate the transport of a wide variety of import substrates. The size of pDNA and its lack of a NLS suggest it is unlikely to traverse the NPC as a free molecule. In dividing cells, the nuclear envelope disassembles at the M phase of division, and is therefore not a barrier to DNA nuclear entry (3Tseng W.C. Haselton F.R. Giorgio T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For non-dividing cells, pDNA cyto-nucleoplasmic transport is likely to be a facilitated process that is mediated by the interaction of soluble cytoplasmic factors with the minimal nuclear transport machinery. In support of this notion, one of our laboratories has previously demonstrated that, whereas addition of purified importin-α, -β, and Ran was sufficient to support protein nuclear import, pDNA nuclear import also required complementation with purified nuclear extracts (4Wilson G.L. Dean B.S. Wang G. Dean D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22025-22032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Further, numerous laboratories have reported regulated delivery of functionally active pDNA at the nuclear import level. Initially, well-defined NLS signal peptide sequences were attached to therapeutic nucleic acid molecules, to circumvent the nuclear entry bottleneck (5Cartier R. Reszka R. Gene Therapy. 2002; 9: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Overall, this approach has produced conflicting results, due to confounding factors that include the large size of the DNA molecule compared with the small peptide; masking of the peptide activity by strong interaction of the positively charged peptide with the negatively charged DNA, and modification of the physicochemical properties of the cationic lipid/plasmid complexes by the NLS peptide (6Munkonge F.M. Dean D.A. Hillery E. Griesenbach U. Alton E.W.F.W. Adv. Drug Deliv Rev. 2003; 55: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A second strategy to harness the nuclear import pathway and increase nuclear delivery of therapeutic DNA uses endogenous or recombinant DNA-binding NLS-containing proteins to bind and condense the pDNA (7Fritz J.D. Herweijer H. Zhang G. Wolff J.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). More recently, an alternative approach involves the inclusion of nucleotide sequences into the pDNA, which have affinity for nuclear transport-mediating cellular proteins, such as transcription factors. One of us first demonstrated this notion for pDNAs that contain the SV40 enhancer region, known to bind a variety of transcription factors (8Vacik J. Dean B.S. Zimmer W.E. Dean D.A. Gene Therapy. 1999; 6: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Further, tissue-specific promoter sequences, to permit interactions with specific transcription factors in the cytoplasm, have also been engineered into pDNAs. Thus, incorporation of the promoter for smooth muscle γ-actin, pDNA resulted in effective transport into the nucleus of smooth muscle cells and subsequent gene expression, whereas little pDNA was trafficked to the nucleus of control CV-1 cells (9Dean D.A. Dean B.S. Muller S. Smith L.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Several other workers have now also demonstrated the potential for control and/or enhancement of DNA nuclear import by genetic control elements (10Längle-Rouault F. Patzel V. Benavente A. Taillez M. Silvestre N. Bompard A. Sczakiel G. Jacobs E. Rittner K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6181-6185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mesika A. Grigoreva I. Zohar M. Reich Z. Mol.

Gene Therapy. 2004; 11: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Collectively the above findings provide a basis for a model in which DNA nuclear import is accomplished via interaction with DNA-binding, nuclear-targeted proteins, denoted DNA nuclear shuttle proteins, although a detailed understanding of these interactions remains to be achieved. Our goals were to identify key cytoplasmic determinants of pDNA nuclear import and to determine whether the resulting purified recombinant nuclear-targeted, DNA-binding shuttle proteins are able to reconstitute pDNA nuclear import. We have identified pDNA nuclear shuttle proteins by a combination of pDNA-affinity chromatography and proteomics and show that these can reconstitute nuclear import of fluorescent-labeled pDNA into permeabilized HeLa cells. Further, we demonstrate that insertion of binding sequences from two representative DNA shuttle proteins, NM23-H2 and the homeobox transcription factor Chx10, into reporter gene plasmids results in a significant enhancement of gene transfer. Nuclear import into the digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells using fluorescent-tagged protein (human serum albumin (25 μg/ml of NLS-HSA-FITC)) or fluorescent DNA (10 μg/ml of Oregon Green 488-labeled pDNA (Oregon Green/pCMVβ-DTS) as import substrate was assayed with a nuclear import reaction mix (consisting of import buffer supplemented with 1 μg/ml protease inhibitors, defatted bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), an ATP-regenerating system (2 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, native purified exogenous HeLa cytoplasmic extract (5 mg/ml) as described previously (4Wilson G.L.

Anal. Biochem. 2006; 352: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Detailed experimental procedures are presented under supplemental data. Plasmid DNA affinity matrices were prepared by immobilizing pCMVβ-DTS (that contains the PNA target sequence), via the PNA, onto Sepharose 4B-linked PNA to prepare pCMVβ-DTS/PNA-Sepharose matrix for use in preparing pDNA-affinity columns. The experimental procedures are described under supplemental data. To deplete extracts, purified HeLa cytoplasmic extracts were passed twice over the pDNA-affinity column. Column flow-throughs were dialyzed overnight against import buffer followed by concentration using Centricon-5 microconcentration devices before the determination of pDNA nuclear import activity. The synchronization, arrest at the G1/S phase and FACS analysis of the HeLa cell cycle were performed essentially as described by Al-Mohanna et al. (14Al-Mohanna M.A. Al-Khodairy F.M. Krezolek Z. Bertilsson P.A. Al-Houssein K.A. Aboussekhra A. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and are detailed under supplemental data. The plasmid pCMV-βGal-DTS is based on the plasmid pCMV-βGal (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), containing the SV40 DTS sequence (8Vacik J. Dean B.S. Zimmer W.E. Dean D.A. Gene Therapy. 1999; 6: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The CHX-10 and NM23-H2 binding sequences were inserted into this plasmid using PCR and standard molecular biology methods. The SV40 DTS sequence was amplified by PCR using a common forward primer with homology for the 5′-end of the SV40 DTS (GGGTCGACCTTAAGGGATCCGGTACCTTCTGAGGCGGAA) and two different reverse primers containing either the CHX-10 (GGAAGCTTATAACCTAAGCTAATTAGTTATGCATGAATTCTTTGCAAAAGCCTAGGCCTCCAA) or the NM23-H2 (GGAAGCTTTGGGGAGGGTGGGGAGGGTGGGGAAGGTGGGGAGGAATTCTTTGCAAAAGCCTAGGCCTCCAA) binding sequences, a region homologous to the 3′-end of the SV40 DTS and suitable restriction enzymes sites for identification. PCR fragment sizes were confirmed by agarose gel analysis and purified by QiaExII gel extraction (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). The PCR fragments were then cloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and sequenced to confirm correct addition of the binding sequences to the SV40 DTS. The SV40-DTS sequence tagged with CHX-10 or NM23-H2 was then subcloned back into pCMV-βGal-DTS using appropriate restriction sites and in such a way as to replace the original SV40 DTS sequence. Plasmid DNA was produced using the Qiagen EndoFree Mega Kit (Qiagen). The experimental procedures are described under supplemental data. Statistical analysis was performed using a Mann-Whitney test. Differences in β-galactosidase activity were determined using Newman-Keuls post-hoc tests after significant analysis of variance analyses on log-normalized values. The null hypothesis was rejected at p < 0.05. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. except where indicated. Previously we demonstrated the sequence-specific conjugation of an expression pDNA containing a 366-bp SV40 ori sequence with Oregon-Green 488-labeled peptide nucleic acid (Oregon Green/pCMVβ-DTS), while maintaining the pDNA in its native supercoiled conformation (4Wilson G.L. Dean B.S. Wang G. Dean D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22025-22032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13Hillery E. Munkonge F.M. Xenariou S. Dean D.A. Alton E.W.F.W. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 352: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As previously, we assessed the nuclear accumulation of the Oregon Green-pDNA into digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells by detection with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). As expected, the Oregon Green-pDNA accumulates in the nuclei of permeabilized HeLa cells in the presence of exogenously added cytoplasmic extract. Images representing half-micron z-axial confocal optical sections (Fig. 1A) indicated the bona fide nuclear localization of fluorescent pDNA. The Oregon Green-pDNA fluorescence displayed a punctate pattern, in comparison with the more diffuse NLS-HSA-FITC fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S1) suggesting that the exogenously added DNA may associate with specific intranuclear domains. Quantification of the nuclear-localized Oregon Green-pDNA fluorescence intensity showed that addition of the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which specifically binds to O-glycosylated nuclear pore proteins, significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited Oregon Green-pDNA nuclear import (Fig. 1B), presumably due to prevention of translocation of Oregon Green-pDNA through the NPC. Consistent with our previous findings that cytoplasmic cofactors are absolutely required for pDNA nuclear import, import activity was also significantly (p < 0.001) reduced by incubation with heat-inactivated cytoplasmic extract (Fig. 1B). We next asked what effect depletion of putative pDNA-binding factors from the cytoplasmic extract would have on pDNA nuclear import into permeabilized HeLa cells. After two passages through a pDNA-affinity column, comprising bait pCMVβ-DTS immobilized via a sequence-specific PNA to Sepharose matrix, cytoplasmic extracts were recovered, concentrated, and assayed for nuclear import activity. Fig. 1C shows that the import activity of depleted cytoplasmic extract was significantly (p < 0.001) reduced to a level comparable with the WGA-inhibited import activity of native extract. Control extracts, purified using PNA-Sepharose columns lacking pCMVβ-DTS, retained activity comparable with that of native cytoplasmic extracts. Furthermore the activity of control extracts was WGA-inhibitable. As a first step in the identification of the minimal set of factors that are sufficient for pDNA nuclear import activity, we sought to isolate the fraction of the HeLa cytoplasmic extract that was active in nuclear import. This was based on its ability to bind to immobilized PNA/pCMVβ-DTS under native conditions, identical to those under which the nuclear import activity assays were conducted. Fractionation was performed using cytoplasmic extract applied to a pCMVβ-DTS/PNA-Sepharose or control PNA-Sepharose column. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with a linearly increasing salt gradient (Fig. 2) and assayed for pDNA nuclear import activity. The nuclear import of PNA/pCMVβ-DTS into permeabilized cells, supported by concentrates recovered from the pCMVβ-DTS/PNA-Sepharose column, was compared with that supported by concentrates recovered from the control PNA-Sepharose column or native cytoplasmic extracts. We noted that the absolute fluorescence nuclear intensities in this set of experiments were somewhat reduced; this may be attributable to the extensive sample handling involved. Fig. 2 shows significant (p > 0.001) differences in nuclear import activity in the absence of WGA compared with native cytoplasmic extract activities for all groups. The pCMVβ-DTS/PNA-Sepharose elution fractions 6 and 8 were able to reconstitute pDNA import activity compared with control PNA-Sepharose elution fractions 6 and 8 in the absence of WGA. We next identified the putative DNA-binding shuttle proteins. Proteins eluted from a pDNA-affinity column where resolved using high-resolution two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and subjected to MS analysis. Pooled elution fractions from 3 column runs each were resolved on pH 3–10 and pH 6–9 two-dimensional SDS-PAGE elution gels shown in supplemental Figs. S2D and S3D, respectively. High-sensitivity silver stain was used to detect proteins spots on both elution gels owing to low levels of protein involved. Silver staining is however incompatible with MS analysis. We thus used the electrophoretic coordinates based on our silver-stained eluate fraction pH 3–10 and pH 6–9/two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels as reference points to manually remove a total of 62 protein spots of different intensities from Coomassie Blue-stained preparative native HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract pH 3–10 and pH 6–9 two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels, digested them using trypsin and subjected them to MS analysis. MS data obtained by either matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) were searched against SWISS-PROT and TREMBL protein databases using the Mascot data base-searching algorithm and are summarized in supplemental Table S1. MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) unambiguously identified proteins in all 22 spots (supplemental Table S1A, spots 1–22) from the pH 3–10/two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and 32 of 40 spots (supplemental Table S1B, spots 1–40) from the pH 6–9/two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. In addition, LC/MS/MS analysis was used to obtain the amino acid sequence of peptides 8 spots from the pH 6–9 gel that were either too faint or refractory to identification by MALDI-TOF. Supplemental Table S1 shows an overview of all the matches identified by PMF and LC/MS/MS and represents proteins in the pCMVβ-DTS/PNA-Sepharose eluate from both the pH 3–10 (A) and pH 6–9 (B) two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels. Functional characteristics of the protein and subcellular location, as well as the number of matching peptides and percentage sequence coverage are shown. Supplemental Fig. S4A shows the known protein functions, with the most highly represented involving metabolism (27%) and protein fate (18%). Approximately 11% of the identified proteins were involved in structural organization, 14% in DNA synthesis and protein synthesis (5%). The highly abundant GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran represented proteins involved in nuclear transport. Proteins involved in transcription accounted for only 5% of all identified proteins. Central to our study was the identification of soluble cytoplasm/nuclear localized DNA-binding proteins possessing, either discrete NLS signal sequences, or some form of indirect nuclear targeting. Information on the DNA binding and nuclear targeting capabilities of the identified proteins was obtained from the literature, and from bioinformatics prediction using WoLF PSORT (15Horton P. Park K.J. Obayashi T. Fujita N. Harada H. Adams-Collier C.J. Nakai K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W585-W587Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar), DNAProt (16Karmirantzou M. Hamodrakas S.J. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and LOCtarget (17Nair R. Rost B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W517-W521Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). LOCtarget includes the NLS algorithm predictNLS that searches for the prototypical monopartite SV40 large-T antigen PKKKRKV NLS and the prototypical nucleoplasmin KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK NLS. Out of the total identified proteins, only 8 (18%) of the total identified proteins fitted our criteria for putative pDNA shuttle proteins, possessing both the ability to bind DNA and possessing a nuclear targeting capacity (supplemental Table S2). We next asked whether representatives of the eight identified putative shuttle proteins possessing both DNA binding and nuclear import capacity could support pDNA import. Histone H2B was selected as a classical DNA-binding protein. NM23-H2 was selected as a well characterized non-classical DNA-binding protein that is overexpressed in cells and was readily available in our laboratories. Both were evaluated for their DNA binding capacity and nuclear import capabilities. To assess accumulation of histone H2B into the nucleus, Alexa Fluor 555-labeled human recombinant histone H2B (Alexa-H2B) protein was incubated with the minimal import machinery consisting of recombinant importin-α, -β, and Ran, in the absence or presence of WGA, and an ATP-regenerating system. After 6 h of incubation, cells were fixed and nuclei visualized by CLSM. Fig. 3 shows that Alexa-Fluor 555 fluorescence (Fig. 3A) matched the corresponding nuclei in the superimposed phase image, indicating the nuclear accumulation of the Alexa-H2B. Alexa Fluor 555 rim-staining (Fig. 3D) indicated inhibition of the histone H2B nuclear accumulation by WGA, consistent with a previous study demonstrating the energy-dependent nuclear import of fluorescein-labeled histone H2B into permeabilized HeLa cells (18Langer T. Histochem Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Quantification of the Alexa-H2B nuclear fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3G) showed a 60% inhibition of the histone H2B nuclear accumulation by WGA (p < 0.001). To determine whether histone H2B functions as a pDNA nuclear shuttle protein, we performed permeabilized import assays in the presence of the minimal import pathway. Alexa-H2B was incubated with Oregon Green/pCMVβ-DTS, recombinant importin-α, -β, and RAN in the presence or absence of WGA. After 6 h, the Oregon Green/pCMVβ-DTS co-localized with the nuclear-accumulated Alexa-H2B (Fig. 3, B and C). In the presence of WGA, the nuclear accumulation of both the histone H2B and pDNA was inhibited (Fig. 3, E and F). Enhancing the brightness and contrast of the fluorescent images reveals the presence of some residual pDNA staining when the pDNA shuttle protein-nuclear import mediated by the H2B was inhibited by WGA (data not shown). Clearly, manipulating a single image within an experiment misrepresents the data and is not acceptable; therefore, the images shown in Fig. 3 are unaltered. Quantification of the Alexa-H2B nuclear accumulation, shown in Fig. 3I, demonstrates significant (p < 0.001) WGA inhibition. As NM23-H2 lacks a discrete NLS, and its mechanism of nuclear entry is unclear we hypothesized that the constitutively expressed Hsc70, a member of the (Hsp) 70 family of molecular chaperones, plays a crucial role in the nuclear import of a subset of cytoplasmic proteins. Hsc70 possesses a NLS, has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with a NDP kinase homologous to the NM23-H1 and -H2 isoforms in fish hepatocytes (19Tsukahara F. Maru Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8867-8872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Leung S.M. Hightower L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2607-2614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and facilitates entry of karyophilic proteins into digitonin-permeabilized rat kidney cells (21Okuno Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In our present study, Hsc70 was identified in spot number 19 on pH 3–10/SDS-PAGE gel and we, therefore, used recombinant Hsc70 in our characterization of NM23-H2-mediated pDNA nuclear import. Alexa-NM23-H2 and Oregon Green/pCMVβ-DTS were incubated with a recombinant importin-α, -β, Ran mixture, an ATP-regenerating system and Cy5-Hsc70, and nuclear accumulation of the NM23-H2 and import activity assessed after 6 h by CLSM analysis. Alexa Fluor 555 fluorescence (Fig. 4A) was matched to the nuclei indicating nuclear localization of the fluorescent NM23-H2. Fig. 4E shows perinuclear staining in the presence of WGA. Cy5-Hsc70 also accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 4C), this process being inhibited by WGA (Fig. 4G). Quantitation of the Hsc70-mediated-nuclear accumulation of Alexa Fluor 555 fluorescence, shown in Fig. 4I, demonstrates that as well as an 80% inhibition by WGA (p < 0.001), NM23-H1 was unable to enter the nucleus either in the absence or presence of WGA. Finally, the ability of NM23-H2 to support pDNA nuclear import was assessed by incubating Alexa-NM23-H2 with Oregon Green/pCMVβ-DTS, recombinant importin-α, -β, Ran, and Hsc70 in the presence or absence of WGA. After 6 h of incubation, Oregon Green-pDNA co-localized with the Alexa-NM23-H2 (Fig. 4, B and D). The nuclear import of the Alexa-NM23-H2/Cy5-mediated/Oregon Green-pDNA was inhibited by the addition of WGA (Fig. 4, F and H). Enhancing the Oregon Green-pDNA images in Fig. 4 shows the presence of residual pDNA staining when the pDNA nuclear import mediated by the NM23-H2 was inhibited by WGA (data not shown). As such, manipulation of single images within an experiment would misrepresent our data; the fluorescent images shown are unaltered. Fig. 5 shows the quantification of nuclear-localized pDNA fluorescence intensity following 6 h of incubation of Oregon Green/pDNA with Alexa-NM23-H2, -NM23-H1 (with Cy-5-Hsc70), or histone H2B in the presence of recombinant importin-α, -β, and Ran compared with native cytoplasmic HeLa extract. Both NM23-H2 and histone H2B restored nuclear import activity to the levels observed for native cytoplasmic extract. Interestingly, the NM23-H1 isoform in the presence of Hsc70 was unable to reconstitute pDNA nuclear import activity and showed nuclear fluorescence intensities similar to baseline levels seen for recombinant importin-α, -β, and Ran alone. We addressed the effect of incorporating binding sequences from DNA nuclear shuttle proteins on the transfer of pCMVβ-DTS in living HeLa cells. Two sequences, a 34-bp oligonucleotide making up the c-myc nuclease-hypersensitive element (NHE) fragment (CTCCCCACCTTCCCCACCCTCCCCACCCTCCCCA), and a 26-bp oligonucleotide (ATGCATAACTAATTAGCTTAGGTTAT) comprising the DNA-binding sequences of two representative putative shuttle proteins, (NM23-H2 and paired-type homeodomain protein Chx10, respectively (22Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Ferda Percin E. Ploder L.A. Yu J.J. Arici K. Horsford D.J. Rutherford A. Bapat B. Cox D.W.

Genet. 2000; 25: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar)) were inserted into the pCMVβ-DTS plasmid to produce the DNA nuclear shuttle protein plasmids pCMVβ-DTS/NM23-H2 and pCMVβ-DTS/Chx10 (Fig. 6A). We then compared the transfer efficiencies of these two novel plasmids with control pCMVβ-DTS in HeLa cells in culture. To test directly gene transfer in cells with intact nuclear membranes, shown here to be limiting for gene transfer in non-dividing cells, we performed gene transfer experiments in cells blocked at the G1/S border using a combination of serum deprivation and aphidicolin treatment (supplemental Fig. S5). We transiently transfected G1/S-arrested cells with 1 μg of pCMVβ-DTS/NM23-H2 or pCMVβ-DTS/Chx10 and control pDNA (pCMVβ-DTS). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested, and β-galactosidase specific activities measured in cell lysates using a chemiluminescent assay (supplemental data). Fig. 6B shows cells transfected with the two novel pDNAs showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of β-galactosidase activity (pCMVβ-DTS/NM23-H2: 2.3 ± 0.4 and pCMVβ-DTS/Chx10: 1.9 ± 0.3; expressed as ratio of pCMVβ-DTS β-galactosidase activity) compared with cells transfected with pCMVβ-DTS. Taken together with the results demonstrating the ability of putative shuttle proteins to support pDNA nuclear import, re-engineering pDNA with shuttle protein DNA-binding sequences enhances the gene transfer ∼2-fold presumably by increasing the “capture” of the pDNA by cytoplasmic-resident nuclear targeting, DNA-binding proteins. We have identified and isolated cytoplasmic determinants of pDNA nuclear import into digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells. We report that whereas addition of purified importin-α, -β, and Ran is sufficient to support protein nuclear import, pDNA nuclear import also requires complementation with purified cytoplasmic extract, and is WGA inhibitable. Further, we demonstrate a ∼2-fold enhancement of gene transfer upon insertion of DNA binding sequences from representative DNA shuttle proteins, NM23-H2 and homeobox transcription factor Chx10, into reporter gene plasmids. Previous investigations of plasmid nuclear entry in intact and digitonin-permeabilized cells have reported that pDNA is transported into the nucleus in association with nuclear-targeted DNA-binding proteins, such as transcription factors. Our finding that shuttle proteins within the cytoplasmic extract may be crucial for the import of DNA into nuclei of permeabilized cells is consistent with the notion that pDNA transport across the nuclear membrane follows the principles for protein import. Interestingly, the requirement for sequence specificity and protein cofactors in the nuclear import of smooth muscle cell-γ DTS (SMGA DTS) plasmid micro-injected into smooth muscle cells (SMC) has recently been demonstrated in one of our laboratories (24Miller A.M. Dean D.A. Gene Therapy. 2008; 15: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This study found that binding sites for the vascular SMC-specific transcription factors serum response factor (SRF) and mammalian bagpipe homologue (NK3) where required for nuclear import. These data suggest the possibility of constructing cell-specific nuclear-targeted plasmids. Indeed, previous investigations have reported that pDNA can be translocated into the nucleus by inserting the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)) binding sequences into pDNA (11Mesika A. Grigoreva I. Zohar M. Reich Z. Mol. Ther. 2001; 3: 653-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Kuramoto T. Nishikawa M. Thanaketpaisarn O. Okabe T. Yamashita F.

Biotechnol. 2008; 133: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Here, we set out to extend the previous investigations by characterizing the nuclear-targeted DNA-binding proteins in the HeLa cytoplasmic extracts that mediate the import of pDNA into permeabilized cells. The fact that the pCMVβ-DTS/PNA-Sepharose column, but not the control PNA-Sepharose column, depleted the cytoplasmic extract suggested the feasibility of an affinity isolation approach to identify these proteins. Using a pCMVβ-DTS/PNA-Sepharose affinity column, we showed that pCMVβ-DTS/PNA-Sepharose eluates restored nuclear import activity to levels comparable with those seen for native cytoplasmic extracts. Analysis of pDNA nuclear import active fractions by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE revealed protein spots on the elution gels representing those proteins that were enriched in the eluate fraction, presumably on the basis of their ability to bind to immobilized pCMVβ-DTS/PNA. Thus, two-dimensional SDS-PAGE produced a high-resolution protein map of the putative DNA-binding shuttle proteins. Spot analysis showed a ∼4-fold reduction in complexity of the elution fraction compared with that of the native extract, control, or pDNA column flow-throughs. We next identified proteins in the plasmid DNA nuclear import active fraction by sequence analysis using mass spectrometry. The fact that key members of the nuclear import machinery, importins-α and -β, as well as DNA-binding proteins such as common transcription factors were not detected with the proteomics approach is consistent with the well recognized caveat regarding the use of mass spectrometric analysis in conjunction with two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Thus, while the two-dimensional SDS-PAGE separation strategy with its unique ability to resolve proteins offers a powerful qualitative tool, it biases against identification of low abundance proteins such as signaling molecules and transcription factors. Further, high abundance proteins may co-migrate and overshadow the low abundance proteins, making these difficult to detect. Interestingly, metabolic proteins made up the majority of proteins identified in the overall spectrometric analysis. This was initially puzzling, but reports have recently suggested that several nuclear-localized glycolytic enzymes display additional moonlighting roles and carry out non-glycolytic functions (27Jeffery C.J. Trends Biochem Sci. 1999; 24: 8-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Moreover, some glycolytic enzymes with non-glycolytic properties, such as α-enolase (spot numbers 18 and 37 on the pH 3–10 and pH 6–9/SDS-PAGE, respectively), are known to possess evolutionarily conserved consensus myc-binding sites in their regulatory DNA sequences (28Kim J.W. Zeller K.I. Wang Y. Jegga A.G. Aronow B.J. O'Donnell K.A. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5923-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The fact that proteins involved in protein fate, defense, stress and detoxification made up a significant fraction of the total protein captured by the immobilized pDNA under native conditions is not surprising. To protect themselves from oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated protein folding, unfolding, and aggregation, cells are equipped with a variety of antioxidant proteins. Those identified in this study include peroxiredoxin 1 and molecular chaperones, such as heat shock proteins (HSP) 90. Specific effects on these mechanisms resulting from the introduction of exogenous DNA have not yet been described, but may be important to assess in future gene transfer studies. As for all proteomes, the functional concentration of proteins in the cytoplasm is in a dynamic state and proteins involved in protein fate play a key role in the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (spot number 4, pH 3–10/SDS-PAGE) is an example of an enzyme involved in the covalent conjugation of ubiquitin to other proteins, which in turn results in the signaling of several different protein fates (29Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). Characterization of pDNA nuclear accumulation and import activity of two representative pDNA shuttle proteins showed that both the histone H2B and NM23-H2, but not the control NM23-H1, were able to accumulate into the nuclei of permeabilized cells via the importin-α-/β-/Ran-dependent import pathway. Accumulation of both fluorescent-labeled recombinant proteins was WGA-inhibitable and energy-dependent. Both recombinant histone H2B and NM23-H2 were able to restore nuclear import activity to wild-type levels observed for native cytoplasmic extract in the presence of recombinant importin-α, -β, and Ran. Further, when we inserted consensus binding sequences from two representative shuttle proteins, NM23-H2, and Chx10, we were able to demonstrate an increase in gene transfer efficiency. Importantly, the observed increase in gene transfer efficiency occurred in growth-arrested (non-dividing) cells, presumably by enhancing capture and subsequent transport across the NPC by their corresponding nuclear-targeted DNA nuclear shuttle proteins. Recently, investigations demonstrating a significant increase in transgene expression following transfection with pDNA encoding firefly luciferase possessing 5, 10, and 20 repeats of NF-κB-binding sequences inserted upstream of the CMV promoter region has been reported (26Thanaketpaisarn O. Nishikawa M. Okabe T. Yamashita F. Hashida M. J. Biotechnol. 2008; 133: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, we show here, the insertion of a single NM23-H2 or Chx10 DNA-binding site into the reporter plasmid CMVβ-DTS increases β-Gal transgene expression significantly. Further work is needed to elucidate whether increasing the number of DNA binding sequences inserted, as well as optimizing their site placement on the pDNA further increases gene transfer above levels observed in the present study. In conclusion, we have identified eight pDNA-bound proteins present in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, which represent a potential sink for the transport of exogenously added DNA to the nucleus. We have inserted binding sequences from the nuclear targeted-DNA binding shuttle proteins to construct plasmids that produce a significant increase in gene transfer efficiency when transfected into non-dividing cells (possessing an intact nuclear membrane barrier), presumably by enhancing translocation of pDNA across the NPC into the nucleus.

The viruses were genetically characterized as a novel influenza A (H1N1) strain originating in swine, and within a very short time the S-OIV strain spread across the globe via human-to-human contact.We conducted a comprehensive computational search of all available sequences of the surface proteins of H1N1 swine influenza isolates and found that a similar strain to S-OIV appeared in Thailand in 2000. The earlier isolates caused infections in pigs but only one sequenced human case, A/Thailand/271/2005 (H1N1).Differences between the Thai cases and S-OIV may help shed light on the ability of the current outbreak strain to spread rapidly among humans."
https://openalex.org/W2064823286,"Legionella pneumophila possesses several phospholipases capable of host cell manipulation and lung damage. Recently, we discovered that the major cell-associated hemolytic phospholipase A (PlaB) shares no homology to described phospholipases and is dispensable for intracellular replication in vitro. Nevertheless, here we show that PlaB is the major lipolytic activity in L. pneumophila cell infections and that PlaB utilizes a typical catalytic triad of Ser-Asp-His for effective hydrolysis of phospholipid substrates. Crucial residues were found to be located within the N-terminal half of the protein, and amino acids embedding these active sites were unique for PlaB and homologs. We further showed that catalytic activity toward phosphatidylcholine but not phosphatidylglycerol is directly linked to hemolytic potential of PlaB. Although the function of the prolonged PlaB C terminus remains to be elucidated, it is essential for lipolysis, since the removal of 15 amino acids already abolishes enzyme activity. Additionally, we determined that PlaB preferentially hydrolyzes long-chain fatty acid substrates containing 12 or more carbon atoms. Since phospholipases play an important role as bacterial virulence factors, we examined cell-associated enzymatic activities among L. pneumophila clinical isolates and non-pneumophila species. All tested clinical isolates showed comparable activities, whereas of the non-pneumophila species, only Legionella gormanii and Legionella spiritensis possessed lipolytic activities similar to those of L. pneumophila and comprised plaB-like genes. Interestingly, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase A activity and hemolytic potential were more pronounced in L. pneumophila. Therefore, hydrolysis of the eukaryotic membrane constituent phosphatidylcholine triggered by PlaB could be an important virulence tool for Legionella pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W1975418933,"Background The ascovirus, DpAV4a (family Ascoviridae), is a symbiotic virus that markedly increases the fitness of its vector, the parasitic ichneumonid wasp, Diadromus puchellus, by increasing survival of wasp eggs and larvae in their lepidopteran host, Acrolepiopsis assectella. Previous phylogenetic studies have indicated that DpAV4a is related to the pathogenic ascoviruses, such as the Spodoptera frugiperda ascovirus 1a (SfAV1a) and the lepidopteran iridovirus (family Iridoviridae), Chilo iridescent virus (CIV), and is also likely related to the ancestral source of certain ichnoviruses (family Polydnaviridae). Methodology/Principal Findings To clarify the evolutionary relationships of these large double-stranded DNA viruses, we sequenced the genome of DpAV4a and undertook phylogenetic analyses of the above viruses and others, including iridoviruses pathogenic to vertebrates. The DpAV4a genome consisted of 119,343 bp and contained at least 119 open reading frames (ORFs), the analysis of which confirmed the relatedness of this virus to iridoviruses and other ascoviruses. Conclusions Analyses of core DpAV4a genes confirmed that ascoviruses and iridoviruses are evolutionary related. Nevertheless, our results suggested that the symbiotic DpAV4a had a separate origin in the iridoviruses from the pathogenic ascoviruses, and that these two types shared parallel evolutionary paths, which converged with respect to virion structure (icosahedral to bacilliform), genome configuration (linear to circular), and cytopathology (plasmalemma blebbing to virion-containing vesicles). Our analyses also revealed that DpAV4a shared more core genes with CIV than with other ascoviruses and iridoviruses, providing additional evidence that DpAV4a represents a separate lineage. Given the differences in the biology of the various iridoviruses and ascoviruses studied, these results provide an interesting model for how viruses of different families evolved from one another."
https://openalex.org/W1991014328,"The gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) observed in S. cerevisiae mutants with increased rates of accumulating GCRs include predicted dicentric GCRs such as translocations, chromosome fusions and isoduplications. These GCRs resemble the genome rearrangements found as mutations underlying inherited diseases as well as in the karyotypes of many cancers exhibiting ongoing genome instabilityThe structures of predicted dicentric GCRs were analyzed using multiple strategies including array-comparative genomic hybridization, pulse field gel electrophoresis, PCR amplification of predicted breakpoints and sequencing. The dicentric GCRs were found to be unstable and to have undergone secondary rearrangements to produce stable monocentric GCRs. The types of secondary rearrangements observed included: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-dependent intramolecular deletion of centromeres; chromosome breakage followed by NHEJ-mediated circularization or broken-end fusion to another chromosome telomere; and homologous recombination (HR)-dependent non-reciprocal translocations apparently mediated by break-induced replication. A number of these GCRs appeared to have undergone multiple bridge-fusion-breakage cycles. We also observed examples of chromosomes with extensive ongoing end decay in mec1 tlc1 mutants, suggesting that Mec1 protects chromosome ends from degradation and contributes to telomere maintenance by HR.HR between repeated sequences resulting in secondary rearrangements was the most prevalent pathway for resolution of dicentric GCRs regardless of the structure of the initial dicentric GCR, although at least three other resolution mechanisms were observed. The resolution of dicentric GCRs to stable rearranged chromosomes could in part account for the complex karyotypes seen in some cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2007844529,"The dysfunction of proteasomes and mitochondria has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. However, the mechanism by which this dysfunction causes neuronal cell death is unknown. We studied the role of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)-p35 in the neuronal cell death induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyrinidinium ion (MPP+), which has been used as an in vitro model of Parkinson disease. When cultured neurons were treated with 100 μm MPP+, p35 was degraded by proteasomes at 3 h, much earlier than the neurons underwent cell death at 12–24 h. The degradation of p35 was accompanied by the down-regulation of Cdk5 activity. We looked for the primary target of MPP+ that triggered the proteasome-mediated degradation of p35. MPP+ treatment for 3 h induced the fragmentation of the mitochondria, reduced complex I activity of the respiratory chain without affecting ATP levels, and impaired the mitochondrial import system. The dysfunction of the mitochondrial import system is suggested to up-regulate proteasome activity, leading to the ubiquitin-independent degradation of p35. The overexpression of p35 attenuated MPP+-induced neuronal cell death. In contrast, depletion of p35 with short hairpin RNA not only induced cell death but also sensitized to MPP+ treatment. These results indicate that a brief MPP+ treatment triggers the delayed neuronal cell death by the down-regulation of Cdk5 activity via mitochondrial dysfunction-induced up-regulation of proteasome activity.

Several causative genes have been identified for familial PDs, including α-synuclein (2Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedon D. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R.

Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4124) Google Scholar), implicating the impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the pathogenesis of PD. However, the mechanisms underlying the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the development of PD are not yet understood.The 1-methyl-4-phenylpyrinidinium ion (MPP+), a toxic metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), is a neurotoxin used widely to induce dopaminergic neuronal cell death in in vitro models of PD (5Mytilineou C. Cohen G. Heikkila R.E. Neurosci. Lett. 1985; 57: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that MPP+ induces neuronal cell death via several pathways, including the inhibition of complex I activity of the respiratory chain in mitochondria, leading to energy depletion, protein peroxidation, and DNA damage by producing reactive oxygen species and the induction of cytotoxic glutamate secretion (6Dauer W. Przedborski S. Neuron. 2003; 39: 889-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3977) Google Scholar, 7Jackson-Lewis V. Smeyne R.J. Neurotox. Res. 2005; 7: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular pathway resulting in neuronal cell death remains to be identified.Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a member of the Cdk serine/threonine kinase family. Cdk5 plays a role in a variety of neuronal activities including neuronal migration during central nervous system development (8Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G. Veeranna Pant H.C.

Generally, when Cdk5 are activated by their respective activator cyclins, they function in cell cycle progression. However, unlike those cell cycle Cdk5, the kinase activity of Cdk5 is detected mainly in post mitotic neurons. This is because Cdk5 activators p35 and p39 are expressed predominantly in neurons (13Hisanaga S. Saito T. NeuroSignals. 2003; 12: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Cruz J.C. Tsai L.H. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 9: 452-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The amount of p35 is the major determinant of Cdk5 activity, and it is normally a short-lived protein degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (15Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T. Howley P.M.

Hyperactivated or mislocalized Cdk5-p25 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative disorders including PD and Alzheimer disease. In the case of PD, Cdk5 and p35 are found in the Lewy bodies of the dopaminergic neurons of the brain (22Brion J.P. Couck A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1465-1476PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nakamura S. Kawamoto Y. Nakano S. Akiguchi I. Kimura J. Acta Neuropathol. 1997; 94: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cdk5 is activated by p25 and is required for cell death in mouse models of PD induced with MPTP (24Smith P.D. Crocker S.J. Jackson-Lewis V. Jordan-Sciutto K.L. Hayley S. Mount M.P. O'Hare M.J.

It has been shown that Cdk5-p25 in MPTP-treated neurons phosphorylates the survival factor, myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), to inactivate it, leading to cell death (26Smith P.D. Mount M.P. Shree R. Callaghan S. Slack R.S. Anisman H. Vincent I. Wang X. Mao Z. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 27Gong X. Tang X. Wiedmann M. Wang X. Peng J. Zheng D. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Mao Z. Neuron. 2003; 38: 33-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, further studies are required to clarify the involvement of p35 metabolism in the PD pathway.Contrary to its role in cell death progression, recent studies have also suggested a survival function for Cdk5 in maintaining survival signals or counteracting apoptotic signals. For example, Cdk5 inhibits c-Jun phosphorylation by c-Jun-N-terminal protein kinase 3, which is activated by UV irradiation (28Li B.S. Zhang L. Takahashi S. Ma W. Jaffe H. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cdk5 also promotes the survival of neurons by activating Akt through the well known neuregulin/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) survival pathway, which leads to the down-regulation of proapoptotic factors (29Li B.S. Ma W. Jaffe H. Zheng Y. Takahashi S. Zhang L. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35702-35709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cdk5 attenuates cell death either by up-regulating Bcl-2 through the phosphorylation of ERK (30Wang C.X. Song J.H. Song D.K. Yong V.W. Shuaib A. Hao C. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or by phosphorylating Bcl-2 to maintain its neuroprotective effect (31Cheung Z.H. Gong K. Ip N.Y. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4872-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, whether Cdk5 acts as the anti-apoptotic factor in the PD model of neuronal cell death has not been determined.Here, we studied the role of Cdk5-p35 in the cell death of neurons treated with MPP+. We found that p35 was proteolysed in cultured neurons by either calpain or proteasomes depending on the concentration of MPP+ used. The proteasomal MPP+-induced degradation of p35 occurred earlier and at lower MPP+ concentrations than did its cleavage by calpain. MPP+ up-regulated the overall proteasome activity in the neurons by impairing the mitochondrial protein import system. A brief MPP+ treatment for up to ∼3 h was sufficient to induce delayed cell death at 24 h. The overexpression of p35 suppressed this MPP+-induced cell death, and depletion of p35 increased cell death. Together, these results implicate a role for Cdk5-p35 as a survival factor in MPP+-treated neurons.DISCUSSIONHere, we studied the effects of MPP+ on the metabolism of p35, which is a major determinant of Cdk5 activity, using mouse brain cortical neurons. High concentrations of MPP+ (500–1000 μm) induced the cleavage of p35 to p25 when neuronal cell death occurred. Conversely, MPP+ at concentrations even lower than 100 μm induced the proteasomal degradation of p35 before the neurons underwent cell death. We found that this brief treatment with MPP+ caused the impairment of mitochondrial protein import, resulting in increased proteasomal activity, which led to the degradation of p35 and then the inactivation of Cdk5 activity. The short term MPP+ treatment was also sufficient to commit neuronal cell death. The expression of p35 suppressed the cell death progression of MPP+-treated neurons. In contrast, knockdown of p35 increased the cell death. These results indicate that Cdk5-p35 functions as a survival factor during MPP+-induced neuronal commitment to cell death.Two different types of p35 proteolysis were observed in primary neurons treated with MPP+ in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The cleavage of p35 to p25 was shown to result in the higher Cdk5 activity accompanied by its mislocalization, leading to cell death. This type of MPP+ action has already been reported in cultured neurons and MPTP-treated mice as a model of PD (24Smith P.D. Crocker S.J. Jackson-Lewis V. Jordan-Sciutto K.L. Hayley S. Mount M.P. O'Hare M.J. Callaghan S. Slack R.S. Przedborski S. Anisman H. Park D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13650-13655Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 26Smith P.D. Mount M.P. Shree R. Callaghan S. Slack R.S. Anisman H. Vincent I. Wang X. Mao Z. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cdk5-p25 thus generated translocates into the nucleus to inactivate the survival factor MEF2 by phosphorylation. However, the degradation of p35 induced by a brief MPP+ treatment is attributable to a distinct effect of MPP+ on p35 metabolism. In this case, p35 was rapidly degraded without the generation of p25 by the proteasome, and Cdk5 activity was down-regulated as a result of this p35 degradation. This down-regulation might have been missed in previous studies because the major focus was on the generation of p25 and the consequent cell death.A number of studies have measured the proteasomal activity in MPP+-treated neurons, but their results are controversial, with some reports describing inactivation or no effect and others activation. MPP+ itself does not affect the proteolytic activity of isolated 20S proteasome (39Alves da Costa C. Dunys J. Brau F. Wilk S. Cappai R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9824-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, MPP+ should affect, if any, proteasome activity indirectly through intracellular environmental changes or regulatory factors, most likely mitochondrial dysfunction as discussed below. The down-regulation of proteasome activity is detected mainly after longer MPP+ treatments, e.g. for ∼24 h both in cultured cells (40Höglinger G.U. Carrard G. Michel P.P. Medja F. Lombès A. Ruberg M. Friguet B. Hirsch E.C. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and mouse brain (41Fornai F. Schlüter O.M. Lenzi P. Gesi M Ruffoli R Ferrucci M. Lazzeri G. Busceti C.L. Pontarelli F. Battaglia G. Pellegrini A. Nicoletti F. Ruggieri S. Paparelli A. Südhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3413-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In these cases, long term treatment with MPP+ disrupts mitochondrial complex I activity, resulting in the depletion of ATP. Because the proteasome requires ATP for the degradation of its target proteins, the depletion of ATP may lead to the down-regulation of proteasome activity. This impaired ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is thought to be relevant to the neuronal degeneration of PD. It has been reported that MPP+ does not alter the proteasome activity in TSM-1 and SH-SY5Y neuronal cell lines (39Alves da Costa C. Dunys J. Brau F. Wilk S. Cappai R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9824-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this report, proteasome activity was examined by the degradation of α-synuclein 8 h after MPP+ or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment. MPP+ did not affect the proteasomal degradation of α-synuclein, whereas 6-OHDA inactivated 20S proteasome both in vitro and in vivo through oxidative stress. In contrast, several studies have reported increased proteasome activity as observed here. MPP+ induces the rapid proteasomal degradation of short-lived proteins such as Ret protein in PC12 cells (42Hirata Y. Kiuchi K. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and cyclin D1 in MG63 osteosarcoma cells and HeLa cells (43Bai J. Nakamura H. Ueda S. Kwon Y.W. Tanaka T. Ban S. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38710-38714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Proteasome activity, when measured with a peptide substrates, is elevated by exposure to 10 or 100 μm MPP+ for 2 h (44Sawada H. Kohno R. Kihara T. Izumi Y. Sakka N. Ibi M. Nakanishi M. Nakamizo T. Yamakawa K. Shibasaki H. Yamamoto N. Akaike A. Inden M. Kitamura Y. Taniguchi T. Shimohama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10710-10719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Taking these results together, the above discrepancies could be derived from differences in experimental conditions such as treatment time, types of cells or proteins analyzed. Although systematic studies will be required, MPP+ may affect proteasome activity biphasically, with activation followed by inactivation. MPP+ apparently had no effect after 8 h of treatment (39Alves da Costa C. Dunys J. Brau F. Wilk S. Cappai R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9824-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) when activation turned to inactivation.Because rotenone, a more specific complex I inhibitor, showed an effect similar to MPP+ on the degradation of p35, we assumed that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs upstream of p35 degradation. Complex I inhibition would disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential, which is required for mitochondrial protein import (45Hood D.A. Joseph A.M. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2004; 63: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been shown that MPP+ reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential, which ultimately causes cell death (46Chalmers-Redman R.M. Fraser A.D. Carlile G.W. Pong A. Tatton W.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 47Shang T. Joseph J. Hillard C.J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34644-34653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although we could not demonstrate this conclusively, several indirect lines of evidence suggest that the mitochondrial import system is an intermediate between complex I inhibition and proteasome activation. MPP+ inhibited the import of GFP-mito and Su9-EGFP into the mitochondria. Mitochondrial proteins would similarly fail to be imported into the mitochondria. If mitochondrial proteins are not imported into the mitochondria properly, they are degraded rapidly by proteasomes (48Granot Z. Kobiler O. Melamed-Book N. Eimerl S. Bahat A. Lu B. Braun S. Maurizi M.R. Suzuki C.K. Oppenheim A.B. Orly J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 2164-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For example, preornithine transcarbamylase is degraded by proteasomes in the cytosol when its import is inhibited by oxidative stress (38Wright G. Terada K. Yano M. Sergeev I. Mori M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A slight increase in mitochondrial proteins in the cytoplasm may enhance the degradation activity of the proteasome. This may be a kind of quality control system imposed by mitochondrial dysfunction. Although p35 is not a mitochondrial protein, the increased proteasomal activity may also target short-lived proteins such as p35.The degradation of p35 in cortical neurons is stimulated by glutamate (35Wei F.Y. Tomizawa K. Ohshima T. Asada A. Saito T. Nguyen C. Bibb J.A. Ishiguro K. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. Mikoshiba K. Matsui H. Hisanaga S. et al.J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the MPP+-induced degradation of p35 appears to be distinct from that induced by glutamate. Whereas the glutamate-dependent degradation of p35 is transient and physiological, its MPP+-induced degradation appears long lasting and pathological, as demonstrated by the fact that p35 did not recover even after the MPP+ was washed out. Whereas the autophosphorylation of p35 by Cdk5 is required for its glutamate-induced degradation, this was not observed for its MPP+-induced degradation. Ubiquitination of p35 was also decreased in MPP+-treated neurons. Some short-lived proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway (49Kahana C. Asher G. Shaul Y. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1461-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is well known that ornithine decarboxylase is degraded independently of ubiquitin by the 20S (50Asher G. Bercovich Z. Tsvetkov P. Shaul Y. Kahana C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and 26S (51Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) proteasomes. p53 and cyclin D1 are also degraded by the ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway, in addition to the ubiquitin-dependent one (52Asher G. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13125-13130Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 53Newman R.M. Mobascher A. Mangold U. Koike C. Diah S. Schmidt M. Finley D. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41504-41511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation has been demonstrated for several mitochondrial proteins. For example, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is proteolysed independently of ubiquitin in the cytoplasm by proteasomes (48Granot Z. Kobiler O. Melamed-Book N. Eimerl S. Bahat A. Lu B. Braun S. Maurizi M.R. Suzuki C.K. Oppenheim A.B. Orly J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 2164-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Preornithine transcarbamylase is degraded in the cytoplasm by proteasomes when mitochondrial import is inhibited by Paraquat (38Wright G. Terada K. Yano M. Sergeev I. Mori M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but its ubiquitination was not detected despite extensive experimental efforts. These results implicate MPP+ as an inducer of the ubiquitin-independent degradation of p35 downstream of mitochondrial import impairment.The brief treatment with MPP+ down-regulated Cdk5 activity by degrading p35, leading to the commitment to cell death. We found that the neuronal cell death was counteracted by the overexpression of p35. These results suggested the role of Cdk5-p35 as a survival factor. This was supported by the experiment showing that depletion of p35 in neurons with shRNA increased cell death, consistent with the results that knockdown of Cdk5 induces neuronal cell death (31Cheung Z.H. Gong K. Ip N.Y. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4872-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Treatment with MPP+ may trigger cell death commitment by down-regulating Cdk5 activity through the degradation of p35. Several recent reports show a role for Cdk5-p35 as a survival factor in neurons. For example, Cdk5 activates the phosphatidylinositol 3/Akt pathway by phosphorylating ErB2 and ErB3 to down-regulate proapoptotic signals (29Li B.S. Ma W. Jaffe H. Zheng Y. Takahashi S. Zhang L. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35702-35709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cdk5 also stimulates ERK to up-regulate the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 (30Wang C.X. Song J.H. Song D.K. Yong V.W. Shuaib A. Hao C. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or to directly phosphorylate Bcl-2 at Ser-70 to maintain neuronal survival activity. Restored Cdk5 expression in Cdk5 null mice rescues their phenotype and perinatal mortality (54Tanaka T. Veeranna Ohshima T. Rajan P. Amin N.D. Cho A. Sreenath T. Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 550-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A question for future research is how Cdk5 activity counters MPP+-mediated cell death signals.MPP+ is a drug that is used frequently to induce the cell death of dopaminergic neurons in models of PD. Previous studies have argued that MPP+ causes neuronal cell death through several different pathways, including the generation of reactive oxygen species, the secretion of cytotoxic glutamate, and mitochondrial dysfunction (6Dauer W. Przedborski S. Neuron. 2003; 39: 889-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3977) Google Scholar). It is important to understand which pathway is critical to the induction of cell death. Our results raise another possibility, that the down-regulation of Cdk5 activity triggers the commitment to cell death much earlier than previously thought. The ectopic overactivation of proteasome systems followed by Cdk5 down-regulation may also be involved in the commitment to cell death in neurodegenerative disorders such as PD.

To study the cellular function of Ecd in mammalian cells, we generated Ecd(lox/lox) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells from Ecd floxed mouse embryos. Cre-mediated deletion of Ecd in Ecd(lox/lox) mouse embryonic fibroblasts led to a proliferative block due to a delay in G(1)-S cell cycle progression; this defect was reversed by the introduction of human Ecd. Loss of Ecd led to marked down-regulation of E2F target gene expression. Furthermore, Ecd directly bound to Rb at the pocket domain and competed with E2F for binding to hypophosphorylated Rb. Our results demonstrate that mammalian Ecd plays a role in cell cycle progression via the Rb-E2F pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2161962408,"The first step of the bacterial lifecycle is the germination of bacterial spores into their vegetative form, which requires the presence of specific nutrients. In contrast to closely related Bacillus anthracis spores, Bacillus cereus spores germinate in the presence of a single germinant, inosine, yet with a significant lag period.We found that the initial lag period of inosine-treated germination of B. cereus spores disappeared in the presence of supernatants derived from already germinated spores. The lag period also dissipated when inosine was supplemented with the co-germinator alanine. In fact, HPLC-based analysis revealed the presence of amino acids in the supernatant of germinated B. cereus spores. The released amino acids included alanine in concentrations sufficient to promote rapid germination of inosine-treated spores. The alanine racemase inhibitor D-cycloserine enhanced germination of B. cereus spores, presumably by increasing the L-alanine concentration in the supernatant. Moreover, we found that B. cereus spores lacking the germination receptors gerI and gerQ did not germinate and release amino acids in the presence of inosine. These mutant spores, however, germinated efficiently when inosine was supplemented with alanine. Finally, removal of released amino acids in a washout experiment abrogated inosine-mediated germination of B. cereus spores.We found that the single germinant inosine is able to trigger a two-tier mechanism for inosine-mediated germination of B. cereus spores: Inosine mediates the release of alanine, an essential step to complete the germination process. Therefore, B. cereus spores appear to have developed a unique quorum-sensing feedback mechanism to monitor spore density and to coordinate germination."
https://openalex.org/W1974851172,"Maspin is a serpin that has multiple effects on cell behavior, including inhibition of migration. How maspin mediates these diverse effects remains unclear, as it is devoid of protease inhibitory activity. We have previously shown that maspin rapidly inhibits the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), suggesting the involvement of direct interactions with cell surface proteins. Here, using immunofluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that maspin binds specifically to the surface of VSMC in the dedifferentiated, but not the differentiated, phenotype. Ligand blotting of VSMC lysates revealed the presence of several maspin-binding proteins, with a protein of 150 kDa differentially expressed between the two VSMC phenotypes. Western blotting suggested that this protein was the beta1 integrin subunit, and subsequently both alpha3beta1 and alpha5beta1, but not alphavbeta3, were shown to associate with maspin by coimmunoprecipitation. Specific binding of these integrins was also observed using maspin-affinity chromatography, using HT1080 cell lysates. Direct binding of maspin to alpha5beta1 was confirmed using a recombinant alpha5beta1-Fc fusion protein. Using conformation-dependent anti-beta1 antibodies, maspin binding to VSMC was found to lead to a decrease in the activation status of the integrin. The functional involvement of alpha5beta1 in mediating the effect of maspin was established by the inhibition of migration of CHO cells overexpressing human alpha5 integrin, but not those lacking alpha5 expression. Our observations suggest that maspin engages in specific interactions with a limited number of integrins on VSMC, leading to their inactivation, and that these interactions are responsible for the effects of maspin in the pericellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W2017059764,"The Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase is an important regulator of p53 abundance and p53-dependent apoptosis. Mdm2 expression is frequently regulated by a p53 Mdm2 autoregulatory loop whereby p53 stimulates Mdm2 expression and hence its own degradation. Although extensively studied in cell lines, relatively little is known about Mdm2 expression in heart where oxidative stress (exacerbated during ischemia-reperfusion) is an important pro-apoptotic stimulus. We demonstrate that Mdm2 transcript and protein expression are induced by oxidative stress (0.2 mm H2O2) in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. In other cells, constitutive Mdm2 expression is regulated by the P1 promoter (5′ to exon 1), with inducible expression regulated by the P2 promoter (in intron 1). In myocytes, H2O2 increased Mdm2 expression from the P2 promoter, which contains two p53-response elements (REs), one AP-1 RE, and two Ets REs. H2O2 did not detectably increase expression of p53 mRNA or protein but did increase expression of several AP-1 transcription factors. H2O2 increased binding of AP-1 proteins (c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, and Fra-1) to an Mdm2 AP-1 oligodeoxynucleotide probe, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed it increased binding of c-Jun or JunB to the P2 AP-1 RE. Finally, antisense oligonucleotide-mediated reduction of H2O2-induced Mdm2 expression increased caspase 3 activation. Thus, increased Mdm2 expression is associated with transactivation at the P2 AP-1 RE (rather than the p53 or Ets REs), and Mdm2 induction potentially represents a cardioprotective response to oxidative stress.

The human orthologue will be abbreviated as HDM2. The Mdm2 protein binds to the pro-apoptotic p53 tumor suppressor transcription factor to inhibit its transactivating activity (13Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Perhaps more importantly, Mdm2 is a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase that ubiquitinates p53 and other proteins (13Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), thus promoting their proteasomal degradation. Indeed, the stability of p53 protein appears to be of major importance in controlling its abundance (13Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). In addition, Mdm2 may autoubiquitinate to promote its own degradation (14Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H.

P1 primarily regulates constitutive expression of Mdm2 with P2 contributing to a lesser extent. Inducible expression of Mdm2 is regulated by P2, which contains two p53-response elements, and through these p53 itself regulates stress-induced expression of Mdm2 as part of a negative feedback loop (16Barak Y. Gottlieb E. Juven-Gershon T. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Transcripts from the P1 promoter may be translated more slowly than those from P2 because of the presence of short (but differing) upstream open reading frames (two in each) in exon 1 of both HDM2 and Mdm2 transcripts (17Brown C.Y. Mize G.J. Pineda M. George D.L. Morris D.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5631-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Jin X. Turcott E. Englehardt S. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25716-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, P2 contains additional response elements (AP-1, Ets) that may allow induction of Mdm2 expression in a p53-independent manner (19Ries S. Biederer C. Woods D. Shifman O. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. McMahon M. Oren M. McCormick F. Cell. 2000; 103: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 20Phelps M. Darley M. Primrose J.N. Blaydes J.P.

The P1- and the P2-regulated transcripts can each give rise to two identical Mdm2 proteins with translation from the initiation codon in exon 3 encoding an Mdm2 species that migrates at about 90 kDa on SDS-PAGE. A truncated 76-kDa species can also be expressed from a second in-frame initiation codon in exon 4 either following removal of exon 3 by alternative splicing or by internal ribosomal entry (22Saucedo L.J. Myers C.D. Perry M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Mendrysa S.M. McElwee M.K. Perry M.E. Gene. 2001; 264: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Expression of p76 Mdm2 protein is more favored with transcription from P1 than from P2, without there being any change in absolute p90 Mdm2 protein expression (23Mendrysa S.M. McElwee M.K. Perry M.E. Gene. 2001; 264: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). p76 Mdm2 cannot bind to p53 or inhibit its transactivating activity, and it may in fact inhibit the actions of p90 Mdm2 (22Saucedo L.J. Myers C.D. Perry M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here we characterize the Rdm2 gene and the expression of Rdm2 mRNA and protein in response to exposure to ROS (H2O2) in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. We demonstrate that up-regulation of Rdm2 expression by ROS is largely independent of p53 but correlates instead with transcriptional activation at the AP-1-response element. Furthermore, Rdm2 is cytoprotective against ROS-induced apoptosis (caspase 3 cleavage) in cardiac myocytes. H2O2 was standardized volumetrically before use. It was stable at 4 °C for at least 6 months. Antibodies against Rdm2 (sc-965, a mouse monoclonal antibody raised to residues 154–167 of HDM2 corresponding to residues 169–173 in Rdm2 (supplemental Fig. 1) in which region Rdm2 and HDM2 are identical in primary sequence), c-Jun (sc-45X, for supershifting), JunB (sc-46X), JunD (sc-74X), phospho-Elk-1(Ser-383) (sc-7979X), Fli-1 (sc-356X), c-Fos (sc-52X), FosB (sc-48X), Fra-1 (sc-605X), Fra-2 (sc-171X), and ATF2 (sc-187X) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibodies against c-Jun (9162, used for immunoblotting) and 17-kDa caspase-3 (9661) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Sarcomeric α-actin antibodies (A2172) were from Sigma, and appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were from DAKO. Six Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., anti-p53 antibodies were tested. These were 2B2.71 (sc-71819, a mouse monoclonal antibody IgG2b raised against residues 370–378 of human p53), DO-1 (sc-126, a mouse monoclonal antibody IgG2a raised against residues 11–25 of human p53), FL-393 (sc-6243, a rabbit polyclonal antibody IgG raised against full-length human p53), Pab 240 (sc-99, a mouse monoclonal antibody IgG1 raised against residues 156–214 of mammalian p53), Pab 246 (sc-100, a mouse monoclonal antibody IgG1 raised against residues 88–93 of mouse p53), and R-19 (sc-1313, a goat polyclonal antibody IgG raised against an epitope mapping to the C terminus of rat p53). With the exception of DO-1, which is not explicitly specified by the supplier as being able to recognize rat p53, all other antibodies are supposed to recognize rat p53 on immunoblotting. As negative and positive controls, we used lysates from nontransfected 293T cells (sc-117752) and from 293T cells transfected with mouse p53 (sc-125766), respectively, and extracts of daunorubicin-treated cardiac myocytes. The p53 electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) oligodeoxynucleotide probe was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (sc-2579). Other probes were synthesized by Sigma Genosys (Sigma). Phosphorothioate-protected ODNs and standard oligonucleotides were from MWG Biotec. Lipofectin was from Invitrogen. SMART RACE cDNA amplification kits were from Clontech. Myocytes (yield of 3.5–4.5 million cells/heart) were dissociated from the ventricles of 1–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat hearts by an adaptation of the method of Iwaki et al. (24Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (25Bogoyevitch M.A. Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, cells were plated in gelatin-coated Primaria culture dishes (BD Biosciences) at a density of 2 × 106 cells/35-mm dish or 4 × 106 cells/60-mm dish for 18 h in 15% (v/v) fetal calf serum. For most experiments, serum was withdrawn for the 24 h before experimentation, and the cells were used 2 days after their isolation. RNA (for which quantity and purity were assessed from the A260 and the A260/A280 ratio (1.8–2.0 deemed acceptable)) was isolated from cardiac myocytes with RNA-Bee (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions; cDNA was synthesized with random hexamers, and RT-sqPCR (see Table 1 for details of primers) measurements were performed as described in detail previously (3Clerk A. Kemp T.J. Zoumpoulidou G. Sugden P.H. Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 29: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Kemp T.J. Causton H.C. Clerk A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To ensure that there was no amplification of genomic DNA, primers were designed to cross exon boundaries where possible (Table 1), and controls in which the RT step was omitted were carried out. The resulting RT-sqPCR products were analyzed by ethidium bromide-agarose gel electrophoresis and the bands were captured under UV illumination. Sizes of PCR products were estimated by comparison with a ϕX174 RF DNA HaeIII digest DNA ladder or a 100-bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageMaster 1D Prime, version 3.0 (GE Healthcare). Values were normalized to the housekeeping gene Gapd. PCR cycles used (Table 1) were within the exponential phase of amplification (confirmed by construction of amplification curves from PCR over a range of cycle numbers). Sequences of PCR amplicons were determined using an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer by the Advanced Biotechnology Centre (Imperial College London).TABLE 1Details of RT-sqPCR/qPCR primers used For RT-qPCR, cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of RNA using high capacity reverse transcription kits (Applied Biosystems). Primers for qPCR were designed with Primer Express version 3.0 using deduced Rdm2 sequences (supplemental Fig. 2; Table 1). qPCR was performed using a 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). A master mix containing (per reaction) 12.5 μl of Sybr-Green Jump Start Taq Readymix (Sigma) and 5 μl of oligonucleotides (200 mm forward and reverse primers) was dispensed into Optical 96-well reaction plates (Applied Biosystems), and cDNA template was added (7.5 μl, 1:15 dilution in water). PCR conditions for all primer pairs were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Following qPCR, dissociation curve analysis was performed to check for aberrant amplification products. An absolute quantification protocol was used. Values were normalized to Gapd expression. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA (150 μg) using oligo(dT)-cellulose (Sigma). Briefly, total RNA (in 600 μl of deionized water) was incubated for 5 min at 65 °C followed by addition of 1 volume of 2× binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS)). Oligo(dT)-cellulose (5 mg in 100 μl of binding buffer) was added followed by rotation at room temperature for 15 min. The oligo(dT)-cellulose was washed twice with binding buffer (1 ml) and twice with washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) SDS). Poly(A)+ RNA was recovered in 250 μl of elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) SDS; two incubations of 5 min at 37 °C). The purification procedure was repeated, and poly(A)+ RNA was precipitated with 50 μl of 4 m NaCl and 2 volumes of ethanol followed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). After washing with 70% (v/v) ethanol and centrifugation, poly(A)+ RNA was dissolved in deionized water (8 μl). Poly(A)+ RNA was reverse-transcribed using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). Poly(A)+ RNA (0.9 μg) was mixed with oligo(dT) primer (10 mm 5′-CDS primer A, 1 μl), 10 mm SMART II A oligonucleotide (10 mm, 1 μl) in a total volume of 5 μl. This was heated at 72 °C for 2 min and cooled on ice. Subsequently, 5× reaction buffer (2 μl; 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 30 mm MgCl2, 375 mm KCl), 10 mm dNTP (1 μl), 20 mm DTT (1 μl), and PowerScriptTM reverse transcriptase (1 μl) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 90 min. Reverse transcriptase was inactivated at 72 °C for 7 min. The 5′-RACE cDNA reaction mixture (10 μl) was diluted to 250 μl with 10 mm Tricine, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA and stored at −80 °C. Sequence corresponding to 5′-end of Rdm2 mRNA was amplified using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit Universal Primer A Mix (complementary for the extended 5′-end of the 5′-RACE cDNA) and a reverse primer to mRNA in exon 3 of Rdm2 exon 3 (bases 269–302, see Table 1). For each PCR, 5′-RACE cDNA (2.5 μl) was combined with 10×“Advantage” polymerase buffer (10 μl; 40 mm Tricine/KOH, pH 9.2, 15 mm KOAc, 3.5 mm Mg(OAc)2), 5′-RACE 1 primer (1 μl, 10 μm), 10× Universal Primer A Mix (5 μl), dNTP (10 mm), and Advantage 2 polymerase buffer (1 μl). The PCR program was as follows: 94 °C for 5 min; 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 2 min; 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min; then 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min), and finally 72 °C for 4 min. PCR products were analyzed on ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gels and the bands were captured under UV illumination. Products were excised from the gel and then purified using QIAquick PCR purification columns for automated sequencing (Advanced Biotechnology Centre, Imperial College London). For immunoblotting, myocytes were washed in ice-cold PBS (three times) and scraped into 100 μl (35-mm dishes) or (in the case of 60-mm dishes) into 80 μl (antisense experiments) or 150 μl (remaining experiments) of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm β-glycerophosphate pH 7.5, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm benzamidine, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 0.2 mm leupeptin, 2 μm microcystin LR, 10 μm E64, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar), boiled with 0.33 volume of SDS electrophoresis buffer (300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 13% (w/v) glycerol, 130 mm DTT, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue), and stored at −20 °C. For crude nuclear extracts, PBS-washed myocytes were scraped into 150 μl of ice-cold buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm leupeptin, 10 μm E64, 5 mm DTT, 0.3 mm PMSF, 2 μm microcystin LR). Extracts were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and the pellets resuspended in 100 μl of Buffer B containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and the pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm leupeptin, 10 μm E64, 5 mm DTT, 0.3 mm PMSF, 2 μm microcystin LR). Suspensions were incubated on ice (1 h) with mixing every 15 min and then centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were retained and stored at −80 °C or were boiled with SDS electrophoresis buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using between 8 and 12% (w/v) resolving gels as appropriate with 4–6% (w/v) stacking gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (27Clerk A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Anderson M.B. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32848-32857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were standardized using “rainbow” markers (GE Healthcare). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked (60 min, room temperature) with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). Blots were incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted in TBST containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Membranes were washed in TBST (three times for 5 min, room temperature) and incubated (1 h, room temperature) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in TBST containing 1% (w/v) nonfat milk powder. After washing in TBST (three times for 5 min, room temperature), bands were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (reagents from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). In some cases the sensitivity of detection was increased by using unconjugated secondary antibodies in TBST, 1% (w/v) nonfat milk powder, and after washing with TSBT, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated tertiary antibodies before detection by enhanced chemiluminescence. The 20-mer antisense phosphothioate-protected ODN, 5′-TGACATCTGCTCTCACTCGG-3′, was directed against Rdm2 mRNA exon 7, bases 602–621 (supplemental Fig. 2). A mixed backbone HDM2 antisense ODN (5′-UGACACCTGTTCTCACUCAC-3′) against the corresponding region (HDM2 mRNA bases 660–679, accession number NM_002392.2) has been used previously to inhibit HDM2 expression in colon cancer cells (28Tortora G. Caputo R. Damiano V. Bianco R. Chen J. Agrawal S. Bianco A.R. Ciardiello F. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A random sequence (5′-TGGATCCGACATGTCAGA-3′) was used as a control. For transfection experiments, cells in 60-mm dishes were washed three times with antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before exposure to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 200 nm ODN and 20 μg/ml Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Myocytes were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and then the medium was then replaced with Lipofectin-free maintenance medium containing 200 nm ODN. Cells were preincubated for 1 h before exposure to 0.2 mm H2O2 for 6 h and extracted into 80 μl of buffer A (see above). Double-stranded ODN EMSA probes (see Table 2) were prepared essentially as described previously (29Harrison J.G. Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, ODNs were 5′-labeled with 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare), 10 IU of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) (12 μl final volume), and 1.2 μl of Promega 10× polynucleotide kinase buffer. The reaction mixture was incubated (37 °C, 30 min), and the reaction was then terminated by addition of 1 μl of EDTA (0.25 m). Excess [γ-32P]ATP was removed by centrifugation (700 × g, 3 min, room temperature) through Chroma Spin columns (pore size 10) (Clontech) in 1× TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), and the EMSA probes were diluted to 0.4 ng/μl. Crude nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated (10 min, room temperature) with 4 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 25% (v/v) glycerol) and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (GE Healthcare) in a total volume of 20 μl. Radiolabeled EMSA probe (1 μl, 0.4 ng) was added, and the mixture was incubated (20 min, room temperature). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis (120 V, 3 h) on 5% (w/v) nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels formed in 1× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) with 0.5× TBE as running buffer. Gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to x-ray film for 24–48 h at −80 °C. Images were analyzed semi-quantitatively by densitometry (ImageMaster 1D Prime, version 3.0, GE Healthcare). For competition experiments, crude nuclear extracts were incubated (10 min) with the required amount of unlabeled competing probe in binding buffer with poly(dI-dC) as in the standard assay, followed by addition of the radiolabeled wild type probe and continuation of the assay in the standard manner. For supershift assays, crude nuclear extracts (3 μg protein) were preincubated (1 h, 4 °C) with 1–2 μg of antibody.TABLE 2Sequences of EMSA probes Myocytes were exposed to H2O2 (0.2 mm, 2 h), and formaldehyde (final concentration of 1% (w/v)) was added to medium (10 min, room temperature). Cross-linking was terminated with 0.125 m glycine (5 min). Myocytes were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS and scraped into 200 μl of PBS containing 0.2 mm leupeptin, 10 μm E64, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 2 μm microcystin LR. Suspensions were centrifuged (4000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and pellets resuspended in 0.8 ml of ChIP lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.2 mm leupeptin, 10 μm E64, 5 mm DTT, 0.3 mm PMSF, 2 μm microcystin LR, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). Suspensions were incubated on ice (10 min) and centrifuged (4000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the pellets were resuspended in 0.8 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) SDS, 0.2 mm leupeptin, 10 μm E64, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 2 μm microcystin LR). Samples were sonicated (five times for 30 s, 0 °C, amplitude 30% (Sonics Vibra-CellTM sonicator with a 2-mm probe) followed after each sonication by 2 min of recovery in ice-water) to shear DNA into fragments of 200–800 bp. Sonicated samples were centrifuged (4000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were retained. Samples (20 μl) for total DNA input were taken at this stage. Sonicated extracts (750 μl) were diluted with 3.65 ml of ChIP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.01% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) and were precleared with 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry containing 5 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA (rotation at 4 °C for 30 min). Following centrifugation (200 × g, 1 min, 4 °C), anti-transcription factor antibodies (5 μg) were added followed by incubation (4 °C, 16 h, with mixing by rotation). Antibody-protein-DNA complexes were recovered by incubation (1 h, 4 °C, with mixing by rotation) with 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry (80 μl containing 5 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA). Protein A-Sepharose-antibody-transcription factor complexes were recovered by centrifugation (200 × g, 1 min, 4 °C), and pellets were washed in low salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 ml), high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 ml), and LiCl buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and then twice in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Protein-DNA complexes were recovered by incubation (15 min, 65 °C) with 0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% (w/v) SDS (250 μl), and samples were centrifuged (200 × g, 1 min, 4 °C) and supernatants retained. This elution step was repeated, and supernatants were combined. Cross-linking was reversed by incubation (16 h, 65 °C) with 0.2 m NaCl. DNA was extracted by mixing equal volumes of samples with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, pH 8.0) and with separation of the phases by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The upper aqueous phases were retained, and DNA was precipitated by adding 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol for 1 h on ice."
https://openalex.org/W2008416050,"In the presence of ample tryptophan, transcription from the Bacillus subtilis trp operon promoter terminates to give a 140-nucleotide trp leader RNA. Turnover of trp leader RNA has been shown to depend on RNase J1 cleavage at a single-stranded, AU-rich region just upstream of the 3' transcription terminator. The small size of trp leader RNA and its strong dependence on RNase J1 cleavage for decay make it a suitable substrate for analyzing the requirements for RNase J1 target site specificity. trp leader RNAs with nucleotide changes around the RNase J1 target site were more stable than wild-type trp leader RNA, showing that sequences on either side of the cleavage site contribute to RNase J1 recognition. An analysis of decay intermediates from these mutants suggested limited 3'-to-5' exonuclease processing from the native 3' end. trp leader RNAs were designed that contained wild-type or mutant RNase J1 targets elsewhere on the molecule. The presence of an additional RNase J1 cleavage site resulted in faster RNA decay, depending on its location. Addition of a 5' tail containing 7 A residues caused destabilization of trp leader RNAs. Surprisingly, addition at the 5' end of a strong stem loop structure that is known to stabilize other RNAs did not result in a longer trp leader RNA half-life, suggesting that the RNase J1 cleavage site may be accessed directly. In the course of these experiments, we found evidence that polynucleotide phosphorylase processivity was inhibited by a GCGGCCGC sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2116404848,"Sterol-accelerated degradation of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase is one of several mechanisms through which cholesterol synthesis is controlled in mammalian cells. This degradation results from sterol-induced binding of the membrane domain of reductase to endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins called Insig-1 and Insig-2, which are carriers of a ubiquitin ligase called gp78. The ensuing gp78-mediated ubiquitination of reductase is a prerequisite for its rapid, 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation from endoplasmic reticulum membranes, a reaction that slows a rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. Here, we report that the membrane domain of hamster reductase is subject to sterol-accelerated degradation in Drosophila S2 cells, but only when mammalian Insig-1 or Insig-2 are co-expressed. This degradation mimics the reaction that occurs in mammalian cells with regard to its absolute requirement for the action of Insigs, sensitivity to proteasome inhibition, augmentation by nonsterol isoprenoids, and sterol specificity. RNA interference studies reveal that this degradation requires the Drosophila Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase and several other proteins, including a putative substrate selector, which associate with the enzyme in yeast and mammalian systems. These studies define Insigs as the minimal requirement for sterol-accelerated degradation of the membrane domain of reductase in Drosophila S2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1966321990,"In transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders affecting many species, the key event in disease pathogenesis is the accumulation of an abnormal conformational isoform (PrPSc) of the host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPC). While the precise mechanism of the PrPC to PrPSc conversion is not understood, it is clear that host PrPC expression is a prerequisite for effective infectious prion propagation. Although there have been many studies on TSEs in mammalian species, little is known about TSE pathogenesis in fish. Here we show that while gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) orally challenged with brain homogenates prepared either from a BSE infected cow or from scrapie infected sheep developed no clinical prion disease, the brains of TSE-fed fish sampled two years after challenge did show signs of neurodegeneration and accumulation of deposits that reacted positively with antibodies raised against sea bream PrP. The control groups, fed with brains from uninfected animals, showed no such signs. Remarkably, the deposits developed much more rapidly and extensively in fish inoculated with BSE-infected material than in the ones challenged with the scrapie-infected brain homogenate, with numerous deposits being proteinase K-resistant. These plaque-like aggregates exhibited congophilia and birefringence in polarized light, consistent with an amyloid-like component. The neurodegeneration and abnormal deposition in the brains of fish challenged with prion, especially BSE, raises concerns about the potential risk to public health. As fish aquaculture is an economically important industry providing high protein nutrition for humans and other mammalian species, the prospect of farmed fish being contaminated with infectious mammalian PrPSc, or of a prion disease developing in farmed fish is alarming and requires further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2031790190,"Sex determination processes vary widely among different vertebrate taxa, but no group offers as much diversity for the study of the evolution of sex determination as teleost fish. However, the knowledge about sex determination gene cascades is scarce in this species-rich group and further difficulties arise when considering hybrid fish taxa, in which mechanisms exhibited by parental species are often disrupted. Even though hybridisation is frequent among teleosts, gene based approaches on sex determination have seldom been conducted in hybrid fish. The hybrid polyploid complex of Squalius alburnoides was used as a model to address this question.We have initiated the isolation and characterization of regulatory elements (dmrt1, wt1, dax1 and figla) potentially involved in sex determination in S. alburnoides and in the parental species S. pyrenaicus and analysed their expression patterns by in situ hybridisation. In adults, an overall conservation in the cellular localization of the gene transcripts was observed between the hybrids and parental species. Some novel features emerged, such as dmrt1 expression in adult ovaries, and the non-dimorphic expression of figla, an ovarian marker in other species, in gonads of both sexes in S. alburnoides and S. pyrenaicus. The potential contribution of each gene to the sex determination process was assessed based on the timing and location of expression. Dmrt1 and wt1 transcripts were found at early stages of male development in S. alburnoides and are most likely implicated in the process of gonad development.For the first time in the study of this hybrid complex, it was possible to directly compare the gene expression patterns between the bisexual parental species and the various hybrid forms, for an extended set of genes. The contribution of these genes to gonad integrity maintenance and functionality is apparently unaltered in the hybrids, suggesting that no abrupt shifts in gene expression occurred as a result of hybridisation."

https://openalex.org/W2107734226,"T-cadherin (T-cad) promotes survival, proliferation, and migration of endothelial cells and induces angiogenesis. We aimed to identify domains of T-cad functionally relevant to its effects on endothelial cell behavior. To specifically target the functional properties of the 5 cadherin repeat domains (EC1-EC5) of T-cad, endothelial cells were transduced with lentivectors containing specific T-cad-domain-deletion mutant constructs (DeltaI, DeltaII, DeltaIII, DeltaIV, DeltaV). Empty (E) lentivector-transduced cells served as control. Similarly to overexpression of native T-cad, cells expressing DeltaII, DeltaIII, or DeltaIV displayed elevated levels of p-Akt and p-GSK3beta and increased proliferation rates (for DeltaII, DeltaIII) vs. E. DeltaI- and DeltaV-transduced cells exhibited reduced levels of p-Akt and p-GSK3beta and retarded growth rates vs. E. Stimulatory effects of native T-cad overexpression on Akt and GSK3beta phosphorylation were dose dependently inhibited by coexpression of DeltaI or DeltaV. Subsequent functional analyses compared only DeltaI-, DeltaII-, and DeltaV-mutant constructs with E as a negative control. Unlike DeltaII cells, DeltaI and DeltaV cells failed to exhibit homophilic ligation and deadhesion responses on a substratum of T-cad protein. In the wound assay, migration was increased for DeltaII cells but impaired for DeltaI and DeltaV cells. In endothelial cell-spheroid assay, angiogenic sprouting was augmented for DeltaII cells but inhibited for DeltaI and DeltaV cells. We conclude that EC1 and EC5 domains of T-cad are essential for its proangiogenic effects. DeltaI and DeltaV constructs may serve as dominant-negative mutants and as potential tools targeting excessive angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2070826134,"Maps of 2D DNA walk of 671 examined chromosomes show composition complexity change from symmetrical half-turn in bacteria to pseudo-random trajectories in archaea, fungi and humans. In silico transformation of gene order and strand position returns most of the analyzed chromosomes to a symmetrical bacterial-like state with one transition point. The transformed chromosomal sequences also reveal remarkable segmental compositional symmetry between regions from different strands located equidistantly from the transition point. Despite extensive chromosome rearrangement the relation of gene numbers on opposite strands for chromosomes of different taxa varies in narrow limits around unity with Pearson coefficient r = 0.98. Similar relation is observed for total genes' length (r = 0.86) and cumulative GC (r = 0.95) and AT (r = 0.97) skews. This is also true for human coding sequences (CDS), which comprise only several percent of the entire chromosome length. We found that frequency distributions of the length of gene clusters, continuously located on the same strand, have close values for both strands. Eukaryotic gene distribution is believed to be non-random. Contribution of different subsystems to the noted symmetries and distributions, and evolutionary aspects of symmetry are discussed."
