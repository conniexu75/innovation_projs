https://openalex.org/W2015260577,"In 1953 Medawar pointed out that survival of the genetically disparate (allogeneic) mammalian conceptus contradicts the laws of tissue transplantation. Rapid T cell–induced rejection of all allogeneic concepti occurred when pregnant mice were treated with a pharmacologic inhibitor of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme expressed by trophoblasts and macrophages. Thus, by catabolizing tryptophan, the mammalian conceptus suppresses T cell activity and defends itself against rejection."
https://openalex.org/W2000352412,"Caspases are essential components of the mammalian cell death machinery. Here we test the hypothesis that Caspase 9 (Casp9) is a critical upstream activator of caspases through gene targeting in mice. The majority of Casp9 knockout mice die perinatally with a markedly enlarged and malformed cerebrum caused by reduced apoptosis during brain development. Casp9 deletion prevents activation of Casp3 in embryonic brains in vivo, and Casp9-deficient thymocytes show resistance to a subset of apoptotic stimuli, including absence of Casp3-like cleavage and delayed DNA fragmentation. Moreover, the cytochrome c-mediated cleavage of Casp3 is absent in the cytosolic extracts of Casp9-deficient cells but is restored after addition of in vitro-translated Casp9. Together, these results indicate that Casp9 is a critical upstream activator of the caspase cascade in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2120473562,"Mutation of Caspase 9 (Casp9) results in embryonic lethality and defective brain development associated with decreased apoptosis. Casp9 −/− embryonic stem cells and embryonic fibroblasts are resistant to several apoptotic stimuli, including UV and γ irradiation. Casp9−/− thymocytes are also resistant to dexamethasone- and γ irradiation–induced apoptosis, but are surprisingly sensitive to apoptosis induced by UV irradiation or anti-CD95. Resistance to apoptosis is accompanied by retention of the mitochondrial membrane potential in mutant cells. In addition, cytochrome c is translocated to the cytosol of Casp9−/− ES cells upon UV stimulation, suggesting that Casp9 acts downstream of cytochrome c. Caspase processing is inhibited in Casp9−/− ES cells but not in thymocytes or splenocytes. Comparison of the requirement for Casp9 and Casp3 in different apoptotic settings indicates the existence of at least four different apoptotic pathways in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2062787021,"Experiences are remembered or forgotten, but the neural determinants for the mnemonic fate of experience are unknown. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to identify specific brain activations that differentiated between visual experiences that were later remembered well, remembered less well, or forgotten. During scanning of medial temporal lobe and frontal lobe regions, subjects viewed complex, color photographs. Subjects later received a test of memory for the photographs. The magnitudes of focal activations in right prefrontal cortex and in bilateral parahippocampal cortex predicted which photographs were later remembered well, remembered less well, or forgotten."
https://openalex.org/W2031292590,"Saccharomyces cells suffering a single unrepairable double-strand break (DSB) exhibit a long, but transient arrest at G2/M. hdf1 cells, lacking Ku70p, fail to escape from this RAD9/RAD17-dependent checkpoint. The effect of hdf1 results from its accelerated 5′ to 3′ degradation of the broken chromosome. Permanent arrest in hdf1 cells is suppressed by rad50 or mre11 deletions that retard this degradation. Wild-type HDF1 cells also become permanently arrested when they experience two unrepairable DSBs. Both DSB-induced arrest conditions are suppressed by a mutation in the single-strand binding protein, RPA. We suggest that escape from the DNA damage–induced G2/M checkpoint depends on the extent of ssDNA created at broken chromosome ends. RPA appears to play a key intermediate step in this adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W1969575610,"Chromosome segregation at meiosis I depends on pairing and crossing-over between homologs. In most eukaryotes, pairing culminates with formation of the proteinaceous synaptonemal complex (SC). In budding yeast, recombination initiates through double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and is thought to be essential for SC formation. Here, we examine whether this mechanism for initiating meiotic recombination is conserved, and we test the dependence of homologous chromosome synapsis on recombination in C. elegans. We find that a homolog of the yeast DSB-generating enzyme, Spo11p, is required for meiotic exchange in this metazoan, and that radiation-induced breaks partially alleviate this dependence. Thus, initiation of recombination by DSBs is apparently conserved. However, homologous synapsis is independent of recombination in the nematode, since it occurs normally in a C. elegans spo-11 null mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2013729196,"The c-Myc and E2F transcription factors are among the most potent regulators of cell cycle progression in higher eukaryotes. This report describes the isolation of a novel, highly conserved 434 kDa protein, designated TRRAP, which interacts specifically with the c-Myc N terminus and has homology to the ATM/PI3-kinase family. TRRAP also interacts specifically with the E2F-1 transactivation domain. Expression of transdominant mutants of the TRRAP protein or antisense RNA blocks c-Myc- and E1A-mediated oncogenic transformation. These data suggest that TRRAP is an essential cofactor for both the c-Myc and E1A/E2F oncogenic transcription factor pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2092178332,"lefty-1, lefty-2, and nodal are expressed on the left side of developing mouse embryos and are implicated in left-right (L-R) determination. The role of lefty-1 was examined by analyzing mutant mice lacking this gene. The lefty-1-deficient mice showed a variety of L-R positional defects in visceral organs. Unexpectedly, however, the most common feature of lefty-1-/- mice was thoracic left isomerism (rather than right isomerism). The lack of lefty-1 resulted in bilateral expression of nodal, lefty-2, and Pitx2 (a homeobox gene normally expressed on the left side). These observations suggest that the role of lefty-1 is to restrict the expression of lefty-2 and nodal to the left side, and that lefty-2 or nodal encodes a signal for ""leftness."""
https://openalex.org/W2047039315,"Proteases are crucial for cancer metastasis, but due to lack of assays, their role in intravasation has not yet been tested. We have developed a human Alu sequence PCR-based assay to quantitate intravasated cells in an in vivo model. We demonstrated that metalloproteinases (MMPs), and most likely MMP-9, are required for intravasation by showing that marimastat, an inhibitor of MMPs, reduced intravasation by more than 90%, and that only tumor cell lines expressing MMP-9 intravasated. Cells with low surface urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and uPA receptor (uPAR) were also incapable of intravasation, despite the presence of high levels of MMP-9. We concluded that breaching of the vascular wall is a rate-limiting step for intravasation, and consequently for metastasis, and that cooperation between uPA/uPAR and MMP-9 is required to complete this step."
https://openalex.org/W2002661794,"The mechanism by which asymmetric signals induce left-right-specific morphogenesis has been elusive. Pitx2 encodes a transcription factor expressed throughout the left lateral plate mesoderm and subsequently on the left side of asymmetric organs such as the heart and gut during organogenesis in the chick embryo. Pitx2 is induced by the asymmetric signals encoded by Nodal and Sonic hedgehog, and its expression is blocked by prior treatment with an antibody against Sonic hedgehog. Misexpression of Pitx2 on the right side of the embryo is sufficient to produce reversed heart looping and heart isomerisms, reversed body rotation, and reversed gut situs."
https://openalex.org/W1918234784,"Macrophages are the primary cellular targets of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but the role of macrophage-derived cytokines in LPS-induced septic shock is uncertain. Recent evidence indicates that activation of peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptors contributes to hemorrhagic hypotension and that macrophage-derived anandamide as well as unidentified platelet-derived substances may be contributing factors. Here we demonstrate that rat platelets contain the endogenous cannabinoid 2-arachidonyl glyceride (2-AG), as identified by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry, and that in vitro exposure of platelets to LPS (200 μg/ml) markedly increases 2-AG levels. LPS-stimulated, but not control, macrophages contain anandamide, which is undetectable in either control or LPS-stimulated platelets. Prolonged hypotension and tachycardia are elicited in urethane-anesthetized rats treated 1) with LPS (15 mg/kg i.v.); 2) with macrophages plus platelets isolated from 3 ml of blood from an LPS-treated donor rat; or 3) with rat macrophages or 4) platelets preincubated in vitro with LPS (200 μg/ml). In all four cases, the hypotension but not the tachycardia is prevented by pretreatment of the recipient rat with the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (3 mg/kg i.v.), which also inhibits the hypotensive response to anandamide or 2-AG. The hypotension elicited by LPS-treated macrophages or platelets remains unchanged in the absence of sympathetic tone or after blockade of nitric oxide synthase. These findings indicate that platelets and macrophages generate different endogenous cannabinoids, and that both 2-AG and anandamide may be paracrine mediators of endotoxin-induced hypotension via activation of vascular CB1 receptors.—Varga, K., Wagner, J. A., Bridgen, D. T., Kunos, G. Platelet- and macrophage-derived endogenous cannabinoids are involved in endotoxin-induced hypotension. FASEB J. 12, 1035–1044 (1998)"
https://openalex.org/W2134556593,"As more genomes are sequenced, the identification and characterization of the causes of heritable variation within a species will be increasingly important. It is demonstrated that allelic variation in any two isolates of a species can be scanned, mapped, and scored directly and efficiently without allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, without creating new strains or constructs, and without knowing the specific nature of the variation. A total of 3714 biallelic markers, spaced about every 3.5 kilobases, were identified by analyzing the patterns obtained when total genomic DNA from two different strains of yeast was hybridized to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. The markers were then used to simultaneously map a multidrug-resistance locus and four other loci with high resolution (11 to 64 kilobases)."
https://openalex.org/W1978969746,"Signaling molecules such as Activin, Sonic hedgehog, Nodal, Lefty, and Vg1 have been found to be involved in determination of left-right (L-R) asymmetry in the chick, mouse, or frog. However, a common signaling pathway has not yet been identified in vertebrates. We report that Pitx2, a bicoid-type homeobox gene expressed asymmetrically in the left lateral plate mesoderm, may be involved in determination of L-R asymmetry in both mouse and chick. Since Pitx2 appears to be downstream of lefty-1 in the mouse pathway, we examined whether mouse Lefty proteins could affect the expression of Pitx2 in the chick. Our results indicate that a common pathway from lefty-1 to Pitx2 likely exists for determination of L-R asymmetry in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2002985414,"A high-intensity laser was used to shock-compress liquid deuterium to pressures from 22 to 340 gigapascals. In this regime deuterium is predicted to transform from an insulating molecular fluid to an atomic metallic fluid. Shock densities and pressures, determined by radiography, revealed an increase in compressibility near 100 gigapascals indicative of such a transition. Velocity interferometry measurements, obtained by reflecting a laser probe directly off the shock front in flight, demonstrated that deuterium shocked above 55 gigapascals has an electrical conductivity characteristic of a liquid metal and independently confirmed the radiography."

It was reported that PlGF-1 and PlGF-2 cannot induce angiogenesis, endothelial cell proliferation, or blood vessel permeabilization on their own, but that they can potentiate strongly the effect of VEGF on blood vessel permeabilization, and to a lesser extent the mitogenic effect of VEGF (18Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, other reports indicate that both PlGF-1 and PlGF-2 can induce proliferation of endothelial cells, angiogenesis, and permeabilization of blood vessels, and that PlGF-1 may be less active than PlGF-2 (19Sawano A.

These VEGF165-specific receptors have been recently shown by direct amino acid sequencing to be the products of the neuropilin-1 gene (24Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). Neuropilin-1 has been previously identified as a receptor for the semaphorin/collapsin family proteins which play an important role in the guidance of growing axons (24Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q.

We show here that these receptors also bind PlGF-2 in a heparin-dependent manner, but do not bind PlGF-1.DISCUSSIONThe receptor binding properties and biological activities of PlGF-1 and PlGF-2 were compared in the present study. Binding/cross-linking experiments have shown that endothelial cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells express on their cell surface receptors that bind PlGF-2 in a heparin-dependent manner, but bind PlGF-1 with a much lower affinity if at all. The apparent mass of these receptors was very similar to the apparent mass of the VEGF165-specific receptors which are found on the cell surface of these two cell types (22Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T.

Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). VEGF165, but not VEGF121, inhibited the binding of 125I-PlGF-2 to these receptors. Reciprocal experiments have shown that the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to these receptors is completely inhibited by PlGF-2, but not by PlGF-1. The VEGF165-specific receptors have been recently found to be the products of the neuropilin-1 gene (24Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar), and our data therefore suggests that neuropilin-1 can also be regarded as a receptor for PlGF-2. It is interesting to note that neuropilin-1 seems to be a receptor for at least five different ligands, collapsin-1/semaphorin III/D, semaphorin-E, semaphorin-IV, VEGF165, and PlGF-2 which are active in very different biological processes such as nervous system development, vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis (25Kolodkin A.L.

Levi B.Z. Prog. Growth Factor. Res. 1994; 5: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Evidence indicating that neuropilin-1 may play a role in all of these processes comes from studies with mice targeted for the disruption of the neuropilin-1 gene. These mice had abnormalities in the peripheral nervous system but died in uterus as a result of anomalies in the development of the cardiovascular system (42Kitsukawa T. Shimizu M. Sanbo M. Hirata T. Taniguchi M. Bekku Y. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar).The binding of PlGF-2 to neuropilin-1 was inhibited by a synthetic peptide (pp6) derived from exon 6 of PlGF-2. Interestingly, this peptide also inhibited the binding of125I-VEGF165 to these receptors and to the KDR receptor of the HUVEC cells. In the case of VEGF165 there is evidence suggesting that the exon 7-encoded peptide which distinguishes VEGF165 from VEGF121 mediates the binding of VEGF165 to neuropilin-1, because a fusion protein containing this peptide binds directly to neuropilin-1 (23Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 24Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M.

It is therefore possible that the pp6 peptide also binds to neuropilin-1 and competes directly with VEGF165 and PlGF-2 for binding to this receptor. However, the inhibition of125I-VEGF165 binding which is caused by the exon 6-derived synthetic peptide is reminiscent of the inhibition that is observed when cell surface heparan sulfates are removed from the cell surface of the endothelial cells by enzymatic digestion, or when the access of 125I-VEGF165 to cell surface heparan sulfates is blocked by competitors such as platelet factor-4 (22Gitay-Goren H.

It is therefore also possible that pp6 may alternatively inhibit the binding of both 125I-VEGF165 and125I-PlGF-2 to the heparin-like molecules which normally support the binding of these growth factors to neuropilin-1. We have not been able to discriminate between these two possibilities yet and we are currently conducting experiments in order to distinguish between these two possibilities.Interestingly, a peptide containing the amino acid sequence of exon 7 of PlGF also inhibited the binding of 125I-PlGF-2 to neuropilin-1 receptors. This peptide does not contain a cluster of positively charged amino acids and is therefore not expected to bind to heparin-like molecules. This result suggests that exon 7 of PlGF-2 participates in the assembly of the functional binding domain via which PlGF-2 binds to neuropilin-1, and indicates that the pp7 peptide probably competes directly with PlGF-2 for binding to neuropilin-1. We have noticed that in the presence of a large excess of PlGF-1 the binding of PlGF-2 to neuropilin-1 is inhibited slightly. It is possible that this marginal interaction is mediated by the exon 7 peptide that is also present in PlGF-1. The binding of125I-VEGF165 to neuropilin-1 was also inhibited slightly by this peptide, but the binding of125I-VEGF165 to KDR/flk-1 remained almost unaffected. This result indicates that the neuropilin-1 domain to which PlGF-2 binds may differ from that of VEGF165although the binding domains seem to overlap.Recent experiments have indicated that the binding of VEGF165 to neuropilin-1 enhances the binding of VEGF165 to the KDR receptor (24Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). The binding of PlGF-2 to neuropilin-1 may perhaps potentiate the binding of PlGF-2 to theflt-1 PlGF receptor in a similar manner. We could not test this hypothesis directly in binding experiments because we have failed to detect flt-1 receptors in the endothelial cells using binding/cross-linking experiments or in immunoprecipitation experiments. However, indirect evidence indicates that the HUVEC cells probably express small amounts of functional flt-1receptors. The flt-1 mRNA can be detected in HUVEC cells by Northern blot analysis (28Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Sharon R. Shibuya M. Halaban R. Levi B. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11322-11326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HUVEC cells migrate in response to PlGF-1, and the cell migration is probably mediated byflt-1 receptors (14Clauss M. Weich H. Breier G. Knies U. Rockl W. Waltenberger J. Risau W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17629-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that HUVEC cells express functional flt-1 receptors in amounts that are not detectable in binding/cross-linking experiments. Potentiation of PlGF-2 binding to flt-1receptors as a result of PlGF-2 binding to neuropilin-1 should have been translated to a lower ED50 of PlGF-2 in cell migration assays. However, the PlGF-2 concentrations that induced a half-maximal migratory response were similar to the PlGF-1 concentrations required for a similar response. The binding of PlGF-2 to the neuropilin-1 receptor of the HUVEC cells is strongly potentiated by heparin. Nevertheless, neither the PlGF-2 induced migration of the endothelial cells nor the PlGF-1 induced migration were affected by the inclusion of heparin in the migration assay. Our experiments therefore suggest that the binding of PlGF-2 to neuropilin-1 does not lead to the modulation of PlGF induced migratory responses, and indicates that neuropilin-1 receptors may not be able to associate withflt-1 receptors following PlGF-2 binding.The effect of both PlGF types on the proliferation of endothelial cells was also tested. In one study PlGF was reported to be inactive as a mitogen for endothelial cells (18Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while other studies have produced opposite results (19Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Aonuma M. Shibuya M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ziche M. Maglione D. Ribatti D. Morbidelli L. Lago C.T. Battisti M. Paoletti I. Barra A. Tucci M. Parise G. Vincenti V. Granger H.J. Viglietto G. Persico M.G. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 517-531PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that neither PlGF-2 nor PlGF-1 are able to induce proliferation of HUVEC cells. Furthermore, neither PlGF-1 nor PlGF-2 were able to modulate the mitogenic activity of VEGF121. The biological consequences of the interaction of PlGF-2 with neuropilin-1 are therefore unclear, but it is possible that the interaction of PlGF-2 with neuropilin-1 could affect other responses of endothelial cells such as cell-cell interactions or blood vessel organization in vivo.The binding of VEGF165 to neuropilin-1 is strongly enhanced by the addition of exogenous heparin (24Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 36Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, some VEGF165 binding to these receptors can be seen even in the absence of heparin, provided that cell surface heparan sulfates are present (36Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we could not detect PlGF-2 binding to these receptors in the absence of exogenous heparin despite the presence of cell surface heparan sulfates. This observation may indicate that the binding of PlGF-2 to these receptors may be enabled in vivoonly under conditions in which a source of heparin is available. Activated mast cells produce heparin and can be recruited during tumor development and in inflamed tissues (45Dethlefsen S.M. Matsuura N. Zetter B.R. Invasion & Metastasis. 1994; 14: 395-408PubMed Google Scholar, 46Qu Z.H. Liebler J.M. Powers M.R. Galey T. Ahmadi P. Huang X.N. Ansel J.C. Butterfield J.H. Planck S.R. James T. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 564-573PubMed Google Scholar). PlGF is produced in several types of tumors (47Kodama J. Seki N. Tokumo K. Nakanishi Y. Yoshinouchi M. Kudo T. Eur. J. Gynaecol. Oncol. 1997; 18: 508-510PubMed Google Scholar, 48Takahashi A. Sasaki H. Kim S.J. Tobisu K. Kakizoe T. Tsukamoto T. Kumamoto Y. Sugimura T. Terada M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4233-4237PubMed Google Scholar) and it is possible that under these conditions the binding of PlGF-2 to these receptors may be potentiated. Alternatively, it is possible that the binding of PlGF-2 to these receptors is potentiated only when cell surface-associated proteoglycans carrying heparan sulfate side chains that have a structure which resembles heparin are produced.To examine what structural determinants of heparin are required to support PlGF-2 binding to neuropilin-1, we have conducted experiments designed to determine whether specific sulfation patterns of heparin are needed to support PlGF-2 binding. Our experiments indicate that in the absence of iduronic acid-O-2 or glucosamine-O-6 sulfated groups heparin loses its ability to potentiate PlGF-2 binding to neuropilin-1. In contrast, the absence of sulfate groups on the amine of glucosamine or on glucosamine-O-3 had no effect on the ability to potentiate PlGF-2 binding. These results indicate that the heparin-mediated potentiation of PlGF-2 binding to neuropilin-1 receptors is not a simple effect of net charge because the amount of sulfated glucosamine-O-6 groups and N-sulfated groups in native heparin is similar,To conclude, we have shown here that PlGF-2 binds to the previously identified VEGF165-specific receptors of the endothelial cells while PlGF-1 does not. The binding is strongly affected by heparin and is apparently mediated through a binding site that includes the peptides encoded by exons 6 and 7 of PlGF. However, the biological consequences of the binding of PlGF-2 to these receptors, recently identified as the products of the neuropilin-1 gene, remain unclear (24Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). We have not seen that PlGF-2 binding to these receptors modulates PlGF induced cell migration or nor does it affect VEGF121induced cell proliferation. However, it is possible that other functions such as the formation of cell-cell contacts between endothelial cells, or the permeabilization of blood vessels in vivo (18Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), will be modulated as a result of such interactions. These possibilities are currently under investigation.

These 21 amino acids confer on PlGF-2 a heparin binding ability that is lacking in the other PlGF forms (4Hauser S. Weich H.A.

Neuronal and endothelial NOS are constitutively synthesized but dormant until activated by transient increases in Ca2+, which are necessary for the binding of calmodulin by the NOS. In marked contrast, the third isoform, inducible NOS (iNOS), is not present in resting cells. Instead, the cell must be activated to express the enzyme; its activity is independent of elevated Ca2+ concentrations or exogenous calmodulin (4Xie Q.-W. Cho H.J. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A.

The molecular basis for induction of the human iNOS (hiNOS) gene is only partially understood. Increased production of the iNOS gene splice variants in response to cytokines has been demonstrated (12Eissa T.N. Strauss A.J. Haggerty C.M. Choo E.K. Chu S.C. Moss J. J. Biol.

Functional characterization of 8296-bp of the 5′-flanking DNA of the hiNOS gene revealed that a region upstream from 3.7 kb of the transcription initiation site confers inducibility by cytokines, whereas no effects of cytokines via the proximal part of the promoter have been found (14Chu S.C.

Computer-assisted analysis of the 8296-bp 5′-untranslated region of the hiNOS gene identified potential cytokine-responsive transcriptional elements. These include multiple copies of IFN-γ response elements, two copies of activator protein 1 (AP-1), and two copies of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) response elements (14Chu S.C. Marks-Konczalik J. Wu H.-P. Banks T.C. Moss J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). AP-1 and NF-κB are ubiquitous transcription factors and pleiotropic regulators of the inducible expression of many genes that encode proteins involved in the modulation of inflammatory and host defense processes in eucaryotic cells (18Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3387) Google Scholar, 19Thanos D. Maniatis T.

Protein components of NF-κB and AP-1 are encoded by a set of genes called “immediate early genes” whose transcription is rapidly induced, independently of de novo protein synthesis, following cell stimulation. The AP-1 transcription factor is a complex composed of proteins of the fos and junproto-oncogene families, which need to dimerize to promote binding of the complex to the AP-1 recognition site (21Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). AP-1 has been shown to alter gene expression in response to growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, and carcinogens (20Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3237) Google Scholar). Members of NF-κB transcription factor family share a conserved amino-terminal region of approximately 300 amino acids known as the NF-κB/rel/dorsal (NRD) homology region and include p50, p52, Rel A (p65), Rel B, c-Rel, v-Rel, dorsal and Dif proteins (22Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through its association with its inhibitors, p105 or IκB-like proteins (23Blackwell T.S. Christman J.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB by cytokines or oxidative stress requires either the degradation of its cytoplasmic inhibitor IκB-α or proteolytic cleavage of p105 (23Blackwell T.S. Christman J.W. Am. J. Respir.

This process is transient and terminated through delayed NF-κB-mediated IκB-α induction (24Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). Since the expression of several inducible genes is regulated through AP-1- (25Pankov R. Umeawa A. Maki R. Der C. Hauser C.A. Oshima R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and NF-κB-binding sites (23Blackwell T.S. Christman J.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 24Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar), the present study was undertaken to explore the involvement of NF-κB and AP-1 response elements in transcriptional regulation of the hiNOS gene in human lung epithelial cells. Constructs with mutated NF-κB and AP-1 sites were used to demonstrate roles of these DNA-binding motifs in the activation of the hiNOS promoter by a combination of three cytokines (IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α). In addition, specific members of the NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factor family that bound to each of the response elements in the hiNOS promoter were identified, and their regulation was determined. A549 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) CCL 185), a human alveolar type II epithelium-like lung adenocarcinoma cell line, were grown in Ham's F-12 K medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Biofluids). To induce hiNOS promoter activity, cells were treated with a mixture of recombinant human cytokines (CM) containing interferon-γ (IFN-γ), 100 units/ml, interleukin-1β (IL1-B), 0.5 ng/ml, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 10 ng/ml. IL-1β was from Genzyme, and the others were from Boehringer Mannheim. Total RNA (10 μg/lane) from A549 cells, incubated with and without cytokines, was subjected to formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to Nytran membranes, hybridized with a 3.1-kb, [α-32P]dATP-labeled hiNOS cDNA probe (encompassing the sequence of +1 to +3101), and then evaluated by autoradiography (13Chu S.C. Wu H.-P. Banks T.C. Eissa T.N. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10625-10630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Before RNA was transferred to Nytran membranes, agarose gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed using an Eagle Eye II Still Video System (Stratagene). The intensity of bands on autoradiograms or photographs was determined by densitometry (Personal densitometer SI; Molecular Dynamic). The intensity of hiNOS mRNA bands was normalized to that of ribosomal 28 S RNA. A549 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with constructs containing the luciferase reporter gene. At 80% confluency, after washing in serum-free medium, cells were incubated with 1 μg of DNA and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE Reagent/well (six-well dishes, Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) for 5 h at 37 °C; fetal bovine serum was then added to a final concentration of 10%. After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing cytokines. Cells were harvested 12 h later, and luciferase activity was determined using a Luciferase Assay System Kit (Promega). Briefly, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by adding 200 μl of a 1× lysis buffer (Promega). After 10 min at room temperature, the lysate was removed from the plate and centrifuged at 12,000 × g. To 40 μl of the supernatant, 100 μl of a luciferase assay reagent (Promega) were added, and luciferase activity was immediately measured using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Cell lysates were analyzed for protein content using the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay (Pierce), and luminescence units were normalized for total protein content. Luciferase activities are reported as means of values from four independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. The plasmid pGL3–8.3, containing the full-length hiNOS promoter cloned into the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter gene vector (Promega, Madison, WI), was used for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the NF-κB- and AP-1-binding sites using the ChameleonTMDouble-stranded Site-directed Mutagenesis KIT (Stratagene). By using the selection primer a SalI site in the vector was changed to a SacII 2010 site. After the annealing of selection and mutagenesis primers, the strands were completed with T7 DNA polymerase and circularized with T4 DNA ligase. The parent plasmid was linearized with SalI, and the mixture was transformed in repair-deficient bacteria (XLmutS). DNA was further linearized withSalI to enhance the mutation efficiency, and the resultant DNA digest was transformed into Epicurian coli XL1-Blue competent bacteria cell line. Colonies were expanded, and DNA was harvested and sequenced. Mutagenesis of the deletion construct pGL3–5.574 was performed by a similar procedure, leading to disruption of the AP-1 upstream site. A deletion construct composed of the hiNOS gene 5′-flanking region that contains sequence from −5574 to +168 (pGL3–5.574) was generated using Exo III/Mung Bean Nuclease Deletion Kit (Stratagene). The 5′-end of the insert was verified by sequence analysis. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were obtained from cells grown to 85% confluency in 100-mm2 dishes and treated with cytokine mixture (CM) for 1, 3, 6, or 24 h. All extraction procedures were performed on ice with ice-cold reagents. Cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested by scraping into 4 ml of PBS, and centrifuged (500 × g, 5 min). The pellet was dispersed in 1 packed cell volume of hypo-osmotic buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin, each 2 μg/ml). After 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.6% (v/v), and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min). Supernatants containing cytoplasmic proteins were stored at −70 °C. The pelleted nuclei were dispersed in a high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin, each 2 μg/ml) to solubilize DNA-binding proteins. The suspended nuclei were gently shaken for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge (12,000 × g, 20 min). The clear supernatants containing nuclear proteins were stored in small portions at −70 °C until used for EMSA. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standard. Complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 380B DNA Synthesizer. The positive strands of the double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the identical regions of the hiNOS promoter are as follows (mutated (mt) sequences are underlined and nomenclature used in the text is indicated in bold):wt NF-κBu (−8287 to −8270), 5′-CCCTGGGGAACTCCTGCA-3′;mt NF-κBu, 5′-CCCTATAGAACTAATGCA-3′; wt NF-κBd (−102 to −119), 5′-GCTGGGGACACTCCCTTT-3′; mt NF-κBd, 5′-GCTGATAACACTAACTTT-3′;wt AP-1u (−5307 to −5290), 5′-CCAGCTTGAGTCACACTC-3′;mt AP-1u, 5′-CCAGCTTAATTAACACTC-3′; wt AP-1d (−5121 to −5104), 5′-TTTGTGTGACTCACGCCC-3′; mt AP-1d, 5′-TTTGTGTAATTAACGCCC-3′. After purification on Sephadex columns (PD-10 column, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), complementary strands in equal concentrations were mixed and annealed by slowly cooling to room temperature after heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were stored at −20 °C in 50 mm NaCl at a concentration of 1.75 pmol/μl. For EMSA, oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified on Chroma Spin + TE columns (CLONTECH Lab, Inc.). NF-κB- and AP-1-binding activity in nuclei of uninduced and induced cells was determined by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay using the Promega Gel Shift Assay System. Samples (5–8 μg) of nuclear proteins were incubated with the respective radiolabeled oligonucleotides 20 min at room temperature (∼25 °C). Specificities of the binding reactions were tested in competition assays in which a 100-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutated oligonucleotide was added 15 min before the labeled probe. Protein-nucleotide complexes were separated by electrophoresis in a 6% DNA retardation gel (Novex) with Tris borate/EDTA (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at constant current (30 mA) at 4 °C. Photographic film was exposed to dried gels at −70 °C. Supershift experiments were performed by adding antibody (2 μl) to the binding mixture 20 min after addition of the radiolabeled probe, followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C before complexes were separated as described above. Antibodies against synthetic peptides derived from members of the NF-κB/Rel family (Rel A (amino acids 3–19; designated Rel A (A)), Rel A (amino acids 531–550; designated Rel A (C)), p50, p52, c-Rel, and Rel B) and of the Jun and Fos family (c-Jun, Jun B, Jun D, c-Fos, Fos B, Fra-1, and Fra-2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein samples (20–30 μg) were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (Novex), boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% gels (Novex). After electrophoresis and electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) using the Novex Xcell Mini-Gel System, the membranes were incubated overnight in 5% non-fat milk, rinsed, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies at dilutions of 1:500 for rabbit polyclonal antibodies and 1:1000 for goat polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz, CA) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TPBS) with 3% non-fat milk. Primary antibody was removed by washing five times in TPBS. Peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were added at a dilution of 1:3000 (anti-rabbit IgG-Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; anti-goat IgG, Santa Cruz, CA). After 1 h at room temperature and five washes in TPBS, blots were incubated in enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray film. The effect of cytokines on hiNOS mRNA was evaluated in A549 cells incubated with a CM (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ) for 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, or 48 h (Fig. 1). By Northern analysis, hiNOS mRNA first appeared at 4 h (16%), was highest at 12 h (100%), and had declined to 20% of maximal levels by 48 h. In each of the decameric NF-κB sequence motifs, five nucleotides were changed (Fig. 2). Similarly, constructs bearing a three-base mutation in the AP-1-binding motif were generated (Fig. 2). A549 cells transfected with wild-type and mutated iNOS promoters were incubated for 12 h with a combination of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1β, and TNF-α (CM). After transient transfection, CM induction of the luciferase reporter driven by 8296 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site of the hiNOS gene (wt-8.3) was 48-fold (Fig.3 B). As expected, the promoterless vector containing the luciferase gene (Fig. 3,Bas) was unaffected by CM treatment, confirming that these effects were specific to the hiNOS promoter. A single mutation in the AP-1 heptad at position −5301 (ΔAP-1u) decreased induction by CM to 4.6 from 48.2 for wt-8.3. In contrast, disruption of the AP-1-binding site at −5115 (ΔAP-1d) reduced responsiveness to cytokines by only 45% relative to wt-8.3, indicating functional nonidentity of the two AP-1 elements. Induction by CM in cells transfected with a construct bearing mutations in both AP-1 sites (ΔAP-1u/d) was comparable to that with ΔAP-1u, with a 94% reduction in response. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a regulatory region in the hiNOS promoter is located between −5.7 and −3.7 kb (14Chu S.C. Marks-Konczalik J. Wu H.-P. Banks T.C. Moss J. Biochem.

To confirm further the importance of the upstream AP-1 site, it was mutated in a deletion construct of −5574 bp, which has been shown to be the shortest construct conferring cytokine inducibility on the hiNOS promoter (14Chu S.C.

Disruption of this site resulted in a marked reduction in CM response with activity being 10% of the −5574-wild-type construct (Fig. 4).Figure 3Effect of mutations in the hiNOS gene NF-κB and AP-1 sites on responses to CM.

There are only two bases (CT at −5303) in the γ-IRE located outside of the overlap region. These nucleotides are conserved in the γ-IRE consensus sequence, CTKKANNY (26Yang Z. Sugawara M. Ponath P.D. Wassendorf L. Banerji J. Li Y. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9226-9230Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Pearse R.N. Feinman R. Raveth J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11305-11309Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To determine whether the AP-1 or IFN-γ site is responsible for promoter activity, the latter was mutated outside the region of overlap with the upstream AP-1 site by changing nucleotides CT at −5303 to AG. In cells expressing this construct, a 50-fold increase in luciferase activity by CM was observed, similar to that achieved with the wild-type promoter (Fig. 3 B). Expression of mutant NF-κB sites located at −8283 (NF-κBu) and −115 (NF-κBd) had similarly modest effects on hiNOS promoter activation by CM. Compared with levels observed with the wild-type promoter, mutations of the downstream (−115) and upstream (−8283) NF-κB sites decreased induction to 16.3- and 23.2- fold (67 and 52%), respectively (Fig. 3). The level of induction obtained when the cells were transfected with the NF-κBu construct was comparable to that obtained with a construct in which the upstream NF-κB element had been deleted (14Chu S.C. Marks-Konczalik J. Wu H.-P. Banks T.C. Moss J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). When both NF-κB sites were mutated (NF-κBu/d), the decrease was significantly greater (85%) than that with either mutation alone (Fig. 3). The combined effect is consistent with the conclusion that both upstream and downstream NF-κB sites are required for full induction of the hiNOS gene and also with the possibility of cooperation between these two sites. The binding of proteins to 18-bp oligonucleotides, with sequences based on the upstream and downstream AP-1 and NF-κB sites, was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay. A549 cells were incubated without or with CM for 1, 3, 6, or 24 h. This time course was performed to determine whether the effects on binding of the transcription factors paralleled the induction of the hiNOS gene. Specific slow-moving DNA-protein complexes that bind to AP-1 downstream (Fig. 5 I, A) and AP-1 upstream sequences (Fig. 5 I, B) were observed in control cells. CM treatment slightly increased amounts of DNA-protein complexes at 3 and 24 h with oligonucleotides containing either the downstream or upstream AP-1 element. In contrast to AP-1, NF-κB showed different patterns of binding activity after incubation of cells with CM; with a probe for either of the NF-κB-binding sites (Fig.5 II, A and B), complexes were observed only with the nuclear fraction from the cells stimulated by CM. Binding activity was highest after 1 h of CM treatment and then gradually decreased with longer incubation. All DNA-protein complexes were specifically reduced by a wild-type oligonucleotide but not by a 100× molar excess of oligonucleotides with mutated NF-κB or AP-1 sites. Mobility shift assays were performed to identify proteins binding to the AP-1 and NF-κB sites. For AP-1, antibodies raised against proteins of the Jun (c-Jun, Jun B, and Jun D) and Fos (Fos B, c-Fos, Fra-1, and F"

Human T lymphoblastoid cells (Jurkat) were flown on the Space Shuttle to test the hypothesis that growth responsiveness is associated with microtubule anomalies and mediated by apoptosis. Cell growth was stimulated in microgravity by increasing serum concentration. After 4 and 48 h, cells filtered from medium were fixed with formalin. Post-flight, confocal microscopy revealed diffuse, shortened microtubules extending from poorly defined microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs). In comparable ground controls, discrete microtubule filaments radiated from organized MTOCs and branched toward the cell membrane. At 4 h, 30% of flown, compared to 17% of ground, cells showed DNA condensation characteristic of apoptosis. Time-dependent increase of the apoptosis-associated Fas/ APO-1 protein in static flown, but not the in-flight 1 g centrifuged or ground controls, confirmed microgravity-associated apoptosis. By 48 h, ground cultures had increased by 40%. Flown populations did not increase, though some cells were cycling and actively metabolizing glucose. We conclude that cytoskeletal alteration, growth retardation, and metabolic changes in space-flown lymphocytes are concomitant with increased apoptosis and time-dependent elevation of Fas/APO-1 protein. We suggest that reduced growth response in lymphocytes during spaceflight is linked to apoptosis."

Electron-electron interactions together with Umklapp scattering resulted in a correlation gap and an insulating state for small t b . An insulator-to-metal transition was observed when t b exceeded a critical value, on the order of the correlation gap E gap . The absence of a plasma edge on the insulator side of the transition for polarization perpendicular to the chains suggests that the electrons are confined to the chains. The optical features of the metallic state, when contrasted with the magnetic properties, are suggestive of spin-charge separation."

https://openalex.org/W1975190250,"Yeast with defects in vacuolar pH show increased sensitivity to high concentrations of transition metals. This sensitivity has been presumed to result from defective metal storage. We demonstrate that mutations that result in a defective high affinity iron transport system, such as a deletion in the surface ferroxidase FET3, also result in increased metal sensitivity independent of vacuolar function. Multiple copies of transition metal transporter resistance genes, such as COT1 or ZRC1, do not reduce the metal sensitivity of fet3 mutations. Increased metal sensitivity is because of an increased cellular accumulation of transition metals resulting from the increased activity of low affinity iron transporters, such as FET4, that mediates the transport of other transition metals. In cells lacking a high affinity iron transport system, the increased transition metal uptake can be prevented by increased extracellular iron. These results suggest that vacuolar function may not be required for transition metal sequestration.

These results suggest that vacuolar function may not be required for transition metal sequestration. The yeast vacuole is considered to be a site for transition metal storage since yeast mutants defective in vacuolar pH show an increased sensitivity to a wide variety of transition metals (1Kitamoto K. Yoshizawa K. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2687-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ramsay L.M. Gadd G.M. FEMS Microbiol.

This increased sensitivity has been ascribed to an inability to store transition metals in defective vacuoles. These mutants also show a decreased ability to grow on low iron medium and an inability to grow on respiratory substrates. Similar phenotypes, including metal sensitivity, are seen in vps mutants that show defective vacuolar formation (4Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol.

Iron transport relies on a cell surface multicopper oxidase, Fet3p, that converts ferrous iron to ferric iron, which is then transported across the plasma membrane by the permease Ftr1p (7Askwith C.

Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The Fet3p multicopper oxidase obtains its copper in an intravesicular compartment into which a p -type ATPase, Ccc2p, transports copper, thus forming active Fet3p (9Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Mutations in genes required for vesicular traffic result in defective iron transport because of an inability to load copper onto Fet3p. Defects in vesicular pH, either because of a mutation in a subunit of the H-ATPase, or in a vesicular chloride channel thought to be necessary to maintain pH, result in a defective high affinity iron transport system (9Yuan D.S.

We speculated whether the transition metal sensitivity might also be a consequence of a defective high affinity iron transport system. Here we describe increased metal sensitivity of mutants that lead to absence of the Fet3p mediated iron transport system. Defective Fet3p results in iron deprivation leading to increased expression of low affinity transition metal transporters, which can transport transition metals other than iron. Increased metal sensitivity results not from defective vacuolar metal storage but from increased metal uptake.

Both COT1p and ZRC1p were epitope-tagged with myc at their carboxyl terminus using the polymerase chain reaction and ligated into the multicopy vector pTF63 (7Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A.

Each 5′ primer included an upstream promoter region, and the 3′ primer included a myc epitope. Two primers for COT1-myc were: 5′-CCG GAA TTC TAT TAC CCA CGC ATA TCT GG-3′ and 5′-TGC TCT AGA TTA ATT CAA GTC CTC TTC AGA AAT GAG CTT TTG CTC CAT ATG ATC CTC TAA GCA ATC TGC-3′. The two primers for ZRC1-myc were: 5′-CCG GAA TTC ATC TCC GGA CTA AAG CAT TC-3′ and 5′-TGC TCT AGA TTA ATT CAA GTC CTC TTC AGA AAT GAG CTT TTG CTC CAT CAG GCA ATT GGA AGT ATT GCA-3′. The PCR reactions were performed in a Perkin-Elmer PCR machine at conditions of denaturation 92 °C, 40 s, annealing 60 °C, 40 s, elongation 72 °C, 3 min, for 35 cycles. The constructed plasmids were sequenced at the junction of the myc-tagged 3′ end and were also tested for their ability to decrease zinc/cobalt toxicity. Metal sensitivity of yeast strains were tested in CM liquid medium supplemented with transition metals at the specified concentrations. Cells were allowed to grow for 20 h in 5 ml of culture at which point A600 was measured. Iron in the form of ferrous sulfate (500 μm) was added to the cultures as specified. Cells were grown in 20.0 ml of CM medium with transition metals as specified for 20 h. Log phase cells were collected and washed by centrifugation with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA. Cell pellets were digested in 200 μl of 5:2 nitric acid:perchloric acid at 80 °C for 1 h. After digestion, the samples were diluted to 1.0 ml with deionized water and then flamed in a Perkin-Elmer ICP atomic absorption spectrometer. All samples were measured in duplicate, and the experiment was performed at least twice. Total RNA was isolated from yeast grown for 15–20 h in CM medium containing specified supplements. RNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose paper, and probed with FET4, SMF1,SMF2, and ACT1(actin), which were randomly labeled with 32P. The blot was washed with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and then subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C. An oligonucleotide probe for FET4 was designed: 5′-CCG AAT TCT TCG TAC TGT TTG CAG TCA ACA GTA GGT GCT CTA TGA TGA ACG TCA GGC CTA GCA CCC AAG CC-3′. The probe was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 Kinase. The analysis of transcript level was performed as described in Iyer and Struhl (14Iyer V. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5208-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from yeast grown for 15–20 h with the specific transition metals. RNA (50 ng) was hybridized overnight at 55 °C with both the FET4 probe and a probe for calmodulin. The RNA was then incubated with 50 units of S1 nuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.) and applied to an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried onto 3-mm Whatman paper and either exposed to x-ray film or analyzed by use of a PhosphorImager. Cells transformed with plasmids encoding myc-tagged proteins in log phase were harvested and reincubated in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h at 30 °C and then resuspended in fixative buffer that contained 4.0% paraformaldehyde (pH 6.5) for 6 h at 30 °C. The fixed cells were then washed and treated with 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mmEDTA, 1.0% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min and then incubated with 1 mg/ml oxalyticase. The cells were permeabilized by addition of 2.0% SDS in 1.2 m sorbitol for 2 min, washed in 1.2m sorbitol, and then allowed to settle on poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips for 30 min. The cells were washed three times with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with a 1:100 monoclonal mouse anti-myc antibody (9E-10) overnight at room temperature in a humid chamber. The coverslips were washed and then incubated with a 1:200 dilution of a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were visualized using a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope with a Nikon ×100 oil immersion objective. Fluorescent and Nomarski images were acquired using a Princeton Instruments cooled CCD camera and a Macintosh workstation running OpenLab-Improvision cytometry software from a computer-controlled filter wheel in conjunction with a multiwavelength emitter and diachronic filter set (Omega Optical). Previous studies demonstrated that mutants defective in either vacuolar pH or in GEF1, a gene that has homology to a human voltage-regulated chloride channel, show increased metal sensitivity (12Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 15Eide D.J. Bridgham J.T. Zhao Z. Mattoon J.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This result is confirmed by the data shown in Fig.1 in which a gef1-2 mutant shows an increased sensitivity to Co (Fig. 1 A) or Zn (Fig.1 B), as well as Cu and Mn (data not shown). Both vacuolar morphology and pH appear normal in Δgef1 strains. The GEF1 gene product is localized to a prevacuolar compartment, suggesting that its affects on vacuolar function must be indirect. It may be possible that the gef1 defect results in the missorting of vacuolar proteins that affect transition metal resistance. COT1 and ZRC1 are genes that when overexpressed result in increased resistance to Co and Zn, respectively (Refs. 16Conklin D.S. McMaster J.A. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3678-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar and 17Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, and Fig. 1). Although Cot1p was thought to be localized to the mitochondria, examination of the distribution of epitope-tagged protein reveals it to be localized to the vacuole (Fig.2 A). Epitope-tagged Zrc1p is also localized to the vacuole (Fig. 2 C). No increased metal resistance is seen, however, when these genes are overexpressed in a gef1–1 strain (Fig. 1). Examination of the subcellular distribution of these proteins in a gef1–1 strain shows no change from their vacuolar location (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, it is unlikely that mistargeting of vacuolar membrane proteins can explain the defective metal resistance in gef1 strains.Figure 2Immunofluorescent localization of Cot1p or Zrc1p in wild type and gef1–2 cells. Wild type cells or gef1–2 cells were transformed with multicopy plasmids containing epitope marked Cot1p or Zrc1p. The cells were harvested and the proteins localized by immunofluorescence as described under “Materials and Methods.” Shown are localization of Cot1p-myc in wild type cells (A) and in gef1–2 cells (B) and localization of Zrc1p-myc in wild type cells (C) and in gef1–2 cells (D).

As shown in Fig. 3, Δfet3 strains show a markedly increased sensitivity to transition metals. Similar results were obtained for vps 41, which shows a Class B vacuolar morphology (data not shown). This mutation also results in a defective high affinity iron transport system resulting from a defect in copper loading of Fet3p (5Radisky D.C. Snyder W.B. Emr S.D. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5662-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells lacking the high affinity iron transport system can grow because of the expression of other plasma membrane transport systems, which act as low affinity iron transporters. These transporters have a broad specificity and transport other transition metals. We hypothesized that the increased expression of these low affinity iron transporters may account for the increased metal sensitivity. Besides Fet3p there are (at least) three cell surface transporters that may mediate iron transport: Fet4p (Co, Cd, Cu) (19Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Smf1p (Mn), and Smf2p (Mn, Co) (20Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Smf1p and Smf2p are homologous to the mammalian divalent cation transporter NRAMP2 that is responsible for both intestinal transport and reticulocyte endosome-mediated iron transport (21Fleming M.D. Trenor III, C.C.

NRAMP2 expressed in S. cerevisiae can complement a Δsmf1Δsmf2 deletion strain (24Pinner E. Gruenheid S. Raymond M. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28933-28938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Strains with multiple deletions in membrane transport genes grow poorly in iron-limited medium even without added transition metals. An increase in medium iron (YPD as opposed to CM) improves the growth of strains with multiple deletions. Addition of 50 μm Co to YPD plates does not affect the growth of wild type cells but has a severe affect on the growth of Δfet3 cells (Fig.4). Deletion of the FET4 gene allows the Δfet3 strain to grow in the presence of Co. An additional deletion in the SMF1 gene has no effect. If deletion of the FET4 gene suppresses the transition metal toxicity in Δfet3 strains, then there may be an increased expression of FET4 transcripts in strains incubated in transition metals. Analysis of FET4 transcription by either Northern or S1 analysis reveals an increased level of transcript in Δfet3 cells relative to wild type (Fig.5). In several different experiments, the increase in transcript level was usually no greater than 2-fold. Addition of transition metals to the Δfet3 cells resulted in a 2–5-fold increase in FET4 transcript level, depending upon the metal, whereas no increase in transcript is seen in wild type strains. We did not observe any increase in SMF1 or SMF2 transcripts in Δfet3 cells, or in Δfet3 cells incubated with transition metals (data not shown). This result suggests that increased transition metal accumulation results from the increased activity of low affinity iron transporters. Accordingly, addition of iron to Δfet3 cells should reduce transition metal toxicity. As demonstrated in Fig.6, addition of iron to Δfet3cells completely prevents the toxicity of any of the transition metals tested. Similar results were obtained using either gef1 or vps41 strains (data not shown). If these metals are competing with iron for transport, then Δfet3 cells should show reduced iron levels when incubated with transition metals. Conversely, if iron competes with the other transition metals for uptake, additional iron should raise cellular iron levels and lower the content of transition metals. Incubation with transition metals resulted in an increased content in Δfet3 cells as compared with wild type cells (Table I). As expected Δfet3 strains had a lower cellular iron level than wild type cells. Incubation of Δfet3 with transition metals results in a further decrease in cellular iron content. When Δfet3 cells were incubated with iron, cellular iron content increased, and there was a decrease in the content of the specific transition metal. Exposure of Δfet3 cells to Co, Zn, or Mn resulted in an increase in accumulation of cellular copper that was reduced by added iron. An increased concentration of Mn resulted in decreased cellular iron in the Δfet3 strain, and added iron also restored iron content. There was, however, little difference in the cellular accumulation of Mn in either wild type or Δfet3 cells. Addition of iron to cells incubated in Mn had little effect on the cellular accumulation of Mn.Table IIntracellular transition metal concentration in wild type and Δfet3 cellsCell typeCoCuFeZnMnppmWT0.0000.0530.3431.3900.035Δfet30.0000.0580.0401.3840.024WT/Co0.4160.0620.3491.4820.029Δfet3/Co1.1820.3820.0011.7980.050WT/Co/Fe0.3570.0722.9461.6480.027Δfet3/Co/Fe0.3670.0661.4051.2370.021WT/Cu0.0001.3690.4121.3530.013Δfet3/Cu0.0004.9180.0000.8370.019WT/Cu/Fe0.0001.5020.9271.3000.013Δfet3/Cu/Fe0.0001.2270.2891.0600.011WT/Zn0.0000.0550.33310.9300.027Δfet3/Zn0.0000.2670.00017.6830.035WT/Zn/Fe0.0000.0633.26511.6630.028Δfet3/Zn/Fe0.0000.0731.61711.1370.021WT/Mn0.0000.0610.3241.6270.191Δfet3/Mn0.0000.1450.0291.4270.205WT/Mn/Fe0.0000.0764.8321.4140.187Δfet3/Mn/Fe0.0000.0773.5421.2940.140Wild type and Δfet3 cells were grown in CM medium for 20 h in the presence or absence of transition metals Co (10 μm), Cu (200 μm), Zn (1.0 mm), Mn (2.0 mm), and additional iron.

The data are expressed as ppm normalized to cell number. This experiment was repeated twice with similar results. Our results suggest that any mutation that results in defective Fet3p function (missorting, defective copper loading, or gene deletions) results in increased metal sensitivity. Without Fet3p, the iron requirements of cells are met by increased expression of other transporters. These transporters mediate the uptake of not only iron but other transition metals. Although there are transporters that are highly selective for specific transition metals, such as Cu (CTR1, CTR3) (25Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Elde D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D.

Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), many transporters show a lower affinity and a broader specificity. In the absence of the high affinity iron transport system, the cellular need for iron is met by these lower affinity Fe(II) transport systems. This conclusion is supported by the observation that strains with multiple gene deletions grow poorly in iron-limited medium (Δfet3Δfet4), whereas strains with single deletions grow well. Furthermore, transcription of the FET4 gene is increased under conditions of iron starvation. There may be two reasons why increased transition metals result in increased cell toxicity in strains that are lacking high affinity iron transport. First, because of the low transporter specificity, increased concentrations of Co, Zn, and Cu compete with iron for uptake. This competition results in a further decrement in intracellular iron content (Table I). Second, in the face of high concentrations of transition metals, increased expression of these transporters will lead to increased accumulation of transition metals (Table I). Addition of iron to these cells results in an increased cellular iron level and a decreased uptake of potentially toxic transition metals. Our data also indicate that incubation of the Δfet3 strain with increased concentrations of Co, Zn, or Mn results in increased accumulation of Cu, which is decreased by the additional iron. An increase in Cu sensitivity in both vacuolar acidification strains and in a Δfet3 strain has been seen by Szczypka et al. (3Szczypka M.S. Zhu Z. Silar P. Thiele D.J. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that increased FET3may play a role in copper detoxification and that copper may affect FET3 transcription. Our results do not address the issue of whether Cu affects transcription of FET3. There are differences between our results and those of Szczypka et al. (3Szczypka M.S. Zhu Z. Silar P. Thiele D.J. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as to whether there is increased copper accumulation in mutants that show a defective Fet3p. Many of these differences can be ascribed to strain, medium, and experimental differences. Further experiments are required to determine whether the increased Cu uptake we observed is because of increased expression of high affinity or low affinity copper transporters. Addition of Mn also results in increased metal sensitivity in strains lacking a high affinity iron transport system. Similar to other transition metals, this increased sensitivity is also abrogated by the addition of iron. Addition of Mn, however, does not lower intracellular iron, and Δfet3 strains exposed to high Mn do not accumulate more Mn than wild-type strains. Perhaps Mn toxicity results from a competition with iron at an intracellular level since intracellular iron transporters or enzymes might also recognize Mn. Iron may be displaced from proteins when the intracellular iron concentration is low and intracellular Mn is high. As intracellular iron is increased, the effect of Mn would be reduced. Our data offer an explanation for increased metal sensitivity that is independent of the role of the vacuole in metal storage. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that there is a vacuolar transport system for Cd-glutathione conjugates (28Li Z.S. Szczypka M. Lu Y.P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6509-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Studies have also reported an increased transition metal content in vacuolar-enriched fractions (29Bode H.P. Dumschat M. Garotti S. Fuhrmann G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The transition metal resistance genes COT1 and ZRC1, when overexpressed, are localized to the vacuole and clearly provide resistance to high levels of transition metals. Yet when there is increased expression of transition metal transporters at the cell surface, there is no increased transition metal resistance even in the face of overexpression of vacuolar transporters. Perhaps the role of Cot1p or Zrc1p is to retain in the vacuole metals brought in by endocytosis. In wild-type cells that are iron replete there may be little expression of low affinity transporters, certainly the expression of FET4 is reduced (30Dix D. Bridgham J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11770-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In metal-replete wild type cells, additional transition metals may only enter through the endocytic system. It may be that the role of Cot1p, or Zrc1p is to retain metals within the vacuole. Metals brought in through the cytosol by surface transporters may exceed the capacity of vacuolar transporters. Alternatively, due to the orientation of the vacuolar transporters, cytosolic metals may not be recognized.

Labeling experiments clearly indicate that initially the major granule-bound starch synthase extends glucans available on amylopectin.

Although these results suggested that amylose originates from cleavage of a pre-existing external amylopectin chain, such transfer of chains from amylopectin to amylose was directly evidenced from pulse-chase experiments. The structure of the in vitro synthesized amylose could not be distinguished from in vivo synthesized amylose by a variety of methods. Moreover high molecular mass branched amylose synthesis preceded that of the low molecular mass, suggesting that chain termination occurs consequently to glucan cleavage. Short pulses of synthesis followed by incubation in buffer with or without ADP-Glc prove that transfer requires the presence of the glucosyl-nucleotide. Taken together, these observations make a compelling case for amylopectin acting as the in vivoprimer for amylose synthesis. They further prove that extension is followed by cleavage. A model is presented that can explain the major features of amylose synthesis in plants.

Starch is usually defined as a mix of two distinct polymer fractions: amylopectin and amylose. Amylopectin the major compound is composed of intermediate size α(1→4)-linked glucans that are organized in clusters of parallel chains by a dense packing of α(1→6) linkages. Amylose, which accounts for 20–30% in weight of the starch granule, is often referred to as a smaller linear molecule with very few α(1→6) branches (for review, see Ref. 1Preiss J. Sivak M.N.

These important results establish that amylose is not required for the biogenesis of normal granules.

The polysaccharide, which is similar to vascular plant leaf (transient) starch, harbors little or no amylose whereas the amylopectin displays an altered chain-length distribution. Van den Koornhuyse et al. (22van den Koornhuyse N. Libessart N. Delrue B. Zabawinski C. Decq A. Iglesias A. Carton A. Preiss J. Ball S. J. Biol.

Transient starch structures are those naturally found in plant storage organs prior to storage starch and consequently amylose biosynthesis. Storage starch extracted from mutants defective for ADP-Glc supply together with transient starches extracted from wild-type algae offer a unique opportunity to study the biosynthesis of amylose in vitro. Indeed, prior to their incubation with ADP-Glc, these starches contain virtually no amylose (21Libessart N. Maddelein M.L. van den Koornhuyse N. Decq A. Delrue B. Ball S.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22van den Koornhuyse N. Libessart N. Delrue B. Zabawinski C. Decq A. Iglesias A. Carton A. Preiss J. Ball S. J. Biol.

In addition, the reported levels of GBSSI activity and protein increased 4–5-fold with respect to those found for storage starches. Following the in vitro synthesis experiments reported in this paper, we propose an entirely new mechanism for amylose synthesis in plants. ADP[U-14C]Glc was purchased from Amersham (United Kingdom). ADP-Glc, maize amylopectin, potato amylose, potato starch, sweet potato β-amylase, Pronase, and proteinase K were obtained from Sigma. Amyloglucosidase maltose and maltotriose were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Pseudomonas amyloderamosa isoamylase was purchased from Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories (Okayama, Japan). The reference strain of C. reinhardtii used in this study is 137C (mt − nit1 nit2). I7, defective for the large subunit of ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (sta1–1), was generated by x-ray mutagenesis from 137C and has been described previously (20Ball S. Marianne T. Dirick L. Fresnoy M. Delrue B. Decq A. Planta. 1991; 185: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The GBSSI-defective strain BAFR1 (mt + nit1 nit2 sta2–29:ARG7) contains a disruption of the STA2 gene that was generated through random integration of the pARG7 plasmid in the nuclear DNA ofC. reinhardtii (17Denyer K.

The reaction was terminated by adding three volumes of 96% ethanol. After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded and the starch was suspended in 100% Me2SO and boiled for 20 min. The polysaccharide was precipitated overnight at – 20 °C by adding three volumes of 96% ethanol. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the pellet was dried in air for at least 10 min, dissolved in 500 μl of 10 mmNaOH, and subjected to gel permeation chromatography. To investigate the sensitivity of GBSSI to proteases, concentrations of 0.1 and 0.2 mg·ml−1 were used, respectively, for proteinase K and Pronase using the standard GBSSI assays at 30 min and 1 h after a 30-min preincubation. 0.5–1.0 mg of starch dissolved in 500 μl of 10 mm NaOH was applied to a column (0.5 cm (inner diameter) × 65 cm) of Sepharose CL2B or CL4B, which was equilibrated and eluted with 10 mm NaOH. Fractions of 300–320 μl were collected at a rate of one fraction per 1.5 min. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Glucans in the fractions were detected by their reaction with iodine, and the levels of amylopectin and amylose were quantified by determining the amount of glucose after amyloglucosidase treatment. Isoamylase-mediated debranching of gel permeation chromatography-purified fractions of amylopectin and amylose was achieved as described previously (21Libessart N. Maddelein M.L. van den Koornhuyse N. Decq A. Delrue B. Ball S.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After completion of the debranching reaction, samples were kept at 80 °C in 10% Me2SO to avoid retrogradation of the long glucans into insoluble material. The debranched polysaccharides were subjected to TSK HW-50(F) chromatography as detailed in Ref. 21Libessart N. Maddelein M.L. van den Koornhuyse N. Decq A. Delrue B. Ball S.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Debranching of amylopectin for CL4B gel permeation chromatography was performed in 50 mm NaAc (pH 4.0) containing 59 units of isoamylase. Amylose and amylopectin were dissolved in 25 μl of 0.8 m NaOH, diluted with 25 μl of distilled water and incubated for 24 h at 30 °C in 200 μl of 50 mm NaAc (pH 3.5). The latter contained no β-amylase, 22 units of β-amylase, or both 22 units of β-amylase and 59 units of isoamylase. After adding 150 μl of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (10 mg·ml−1) to 50 μl of sample, the mixture was boiled for 10 min and the number of reducing ends was determined spectrophotometricaly at 540 nm. Maltose was used as a standard. As a control, the β-amylolysis limit was determined for maize amylopectin, potato amylose, and potato starch. Samples (10 mg) were sealed between two aluminum foils, to prevent any significant change in water content during the measurement. Diffraction diagrams were recorded using Inel (Orléans, France) x-ray equipment operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. CuKα1 radiation (l = 0.15405 nm) was selected using a quartz monochromator. A curved position-sensitive detector (Inel CPS120) was used to monitor the diffracted intensities using 2-h exposure periods. Relative crystallinity was determined, after bringing all recorded diagrams at the same scale using normalization of the total scattering between 3 and 30° (2Θ), following a method derived from Wakelin et al. (26Wakelin J.H. Virgin H.S. Crystal E. J. Appl. Phys. 1959; 30: 1654-1662Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Dry extruded starch and spherolitic crystals of amylose were used as amorphous and crystalline standards, respectively. Starch was purified both from nitrogen-starved cultures of mutants defective for the large subunit of ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase and from nitrogen supplied wild-type algae. The granules extracted from these strains displayed GBSSI activities ranging between 15 and 20 nmol of ADP-Glc incorporated into insoluble polysaccharide per min and per mg of starch. This activity displayed an apparent Km of 3.5 mm for ADP-Glc and was entirely protected from Pronase (0.2 mg·ml−1) and (or) proteinase K (0.1 mg·ml−1) action. When using 3.2 mm ADP-Glc, incorporation was linear with time for periods ranging from 10 min to 2 h at 30 °C. Although all experiments reported in this paper were performed from freshly purified material, no loss of GBSSI activity could be evidenced after 1 week of storage at 4 °C. Starch purified from strain BAFR1 (containing a gene-disrupted GBSSI structural gene) displayed less than 0.5% of the wild-type activity, which fell below background when fractionated on Sepharose CL2B columns. This proves that only GBSSI was monitored under our experimental conditions. Fig. 1(A and B) shows the separation of amylopectin and amylose by CL2B chromatography before and after in vitrosynthesis, respectively. After 24 h, we were able to raise the amylose content from less than 2% to over 24% of the total starch. The polysaccharide synthesized under these conditions could not be distinguished from standard C. reinhardtii amylose. Fig.1 C displays an experiment where 0.05 mg of starch subjected to in vitro synthesis for 24 h in the presence of labeled ADP-Glc was mixed and chromatographed with 1 mg of storage starch (20% amylose) extracted from wild-type cultures. We can conclude from these experiments that the molecular mass distribution of the in vitro synthesized material is identical to that of native amylose. Moreover, the fine structure of the in vitrosynthesized product was investigated using debranching analysis followed by gel permeation (Fig.2 A). By all these criteria, the in vitro synthesized polysaccharide proved to be identical to native C. reinhardtii amylose. As with algal native amylose, we detected up to 1% branches within the in vitro synthesized product. We confirmed the presence of a similar branching pattern by measuring the β-amylolysis limit. β-Amylase is known to be an exo-type of enzyme digesting external chains up to 2–3 residues from a branch point. The β-amylolysis limit (the percentage of digested material) for both the in vitro and in vivo synthesized amyloses ranged between 70 and 75%. Together with the identical chain-length distributions revealed by our debranching analyses (see above), these results prove that both polysaccharides contain an identical distribution of α(1→6) linkages with a strong bias toward the reducing end of the molecules (for review, see Ref. 25Buléon A. Colonna P. Planchot V. Ball S.G. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). From all these experiments, we conclude that authentic amylose biosynthesis has been achieved. It must be stressed that this synthesis occurred at the expense of major changes in the structure of amylopectin. The λmax of the iodine-polysaccharide complex of amylopectin increased from 570 to 600 nm (Fig. 1), while debranching analysis (Fig. 2 B) clearly shows that the label is incorporated in the fraction excluded from TSK-HW50 chromatography. The OD of the intermediate and small chain-length amylopectin fractions (26–39) before and after in vitro synthesis were identical, whereas the OD of the long glucan fractions increased dramatically after in vitro synthesis (data not shown). We believe these chains to be external as the β-amylolysis limit of amylopectin increased before and after synthesis from 50–55% to 58–63%, respectively. That these chains are covalently bound to amylopectin is confirmed by the fact that all attempts to dissociate them from amylopectin were unsuccessful. These attempts consisted of dispersing starch with aqueous Me2SO at 100 °C precipitating the chains with ethanol, resuspending the starch in 10 mm NaOH and running columns at various dilutions. We have also submitted the amylopectin to several rounds of Sepharose CL-2B chromatography. Indeed, the long glucan fraction of amylopectin could only be recovered by enzymatic debranching as was reported both by Baba et al. (16Baba T. Yoshii M. Kainuma K. Starch/Stärke. 1987; 39: 52-56Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and by Denyer et al. (17Denyer K. Clarke B. Hylton C. Tatge H. Smith A.

Three milligrams of wild-type amylose and amylopectin separated by CL2B-Sepharose chromatography were mixed with 0.05 mg of amylopectin and amylose from the I7 mutant subjected to 24 h of in vitro synthesis. After debranching with isoamylase, the amylose (A) and amylopectin (B) were subjected to TSKHW-50 chromatography. The optical density (○) of the iodine-polysaccharide complex was measured at λmax. The incorporation of 14C from ADP[U-14C]Glc (•) was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Because of the relative abundance of cold wild-type reference polysaccharides, the OD reflects exclusively the wild-type amylopectin and amylose chain-length distribution, whereas the radioactive material represents the in vitro synthesized glucans.

Hylton C. Tatge H. Smith A. Plant J. 1996; 10: 1135-1143Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar) have reported that, in the absence of maltooligosaccharides, after 1 h of incubation, amylopectin was the predominant if not only labeled species. Although these results could be confirmed by us, it was furthermore evident that this situation changed dramatically when longer incubations were analyzed. Our results reported above show that after 24 h of incubation more than 40% of the label is incorporated in the amylose fraction. To study amylose deposition, we followed the kinetics of in vitro synthesis in the presence of labeled ADP-Glc. For this purpose, we used amylose-less starch granules purified from a nitrogen starved mutant defective for the large subunit of ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (22van den Koornhuyse N. Libessart N. Delrue B. Zabawinski C. Decq A. Iglesias A. Carton A. Preiss J. Ball S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For each time point, a complete analysis involving Sepharose CL2B chromatography of dissolved starch granules was performed. The OD at λmax and amount of labeled material were thus recorded in each fraction and are displayed in Fig. 3 A (from 10 min to 2 h) and Fig. 3 B (from 2 to 24 h). We were thus able to monitor total incorporation of label, as well as the amount selectively synthesized within amylose and amylopectin (Fig.4). It is clear thatChlamydomonas starch behaves very much like that of peas in the initial steps. Indeed, very little if any amylose synthesis occurred during the first hour (Fig. 3 A), while active amylopectin elongation is witnessed. That external amylopectin chains are getting longer is proven by the increase in λmax of the iodine-polysaccharide complex from 570 to 600 nm that is completed within the very first 30 min (Table I). To ascertain that single chains are indeed getting longer, we debranched amylopectin and compared the length of these chains to those characterizing mature debranched C. reinhardtii amylopectin. Results displayed in Fig. 5 together with our β-amylolysis (see above) studies confirm that external amylopectin chains are getting elongated by GBSSI. Moreover, a bimodal distribution of the long glucans of amylopectin is detected. After 2 h of incubation, amylopectin synthesis becomes progressively substituted by that of amylose (Figs. 3 B and 4). After 12 h, amylose synthesis rates exceeded those of incorporation by GBSSI. In addition and at the same time, the λmax of the amylopectin-iodine complex is decreasing from 615 to 605 nm (Table I). This result indicates that incorporation in amylose is accomplished at the expense of amylopectin. It is striking to note that high molecular mass amylose biosynthesis occurs before that of the low molecular mass species. thus mimicking the bimodal distribution of the amylopectin external long glucan fractions. At this point of our analysis, we already suspected that external amylopectin chains were used to generate mature amylose by a single endo-type of cleavage event. We thus undertook experiments specifically designed to test this hypothesis.Figure 4Incorporation of 14C from ADP[U-14C]Glc in amylopectin and amylose. Afterin vitro synthesis in the presence of 14C labeled ADP-Glc, the amylopectin and amylose were separated by CL2B-Sepharose chromatography.

The best way to probe the function of amylopectin as a primer for amylose biosynthesis would be to pulse-label the former and check if we can subsequently chase the label into the latter. We chose to pulse-label amylopectin for 30 min att0 from starch extracted from the same strain as that was used in the time-course experiments described above. As predicted from our previous experiments, amylopectin was found as the sole labeled species immediately after the radioactive pulse. As synthesis proceeded with unlabeled substrate, the label was slowly but clearly chased into amylose (Fig.6 A). Again, the label appeared first in the high molecular mass amylose fraction (Fig. 6 B). We double-checked that pulse-labeled amylopectin external chains could also be chased into amylose in the case of both transient and storage starches from wild-type algae. An example of such an experiment can be found in Fig. 6 C, which displays a pulse-chase experiment with storage starch from wild-type algae. Similar pulses gave similar results, yielding a net chase from amylopectin into amylose. In this case, a low but substantial amount of radioactivity in the amylose fraction was"

A basic physiological role is implied by the high level of conservation of the SDF-1 sequence between species (4Shirozu M. Nakano T. Inazawa J. Tashiro K. Tada H. Shinohara T. Honjo T.

In vitro SDF-1 stimulates chemotaxis of a wide range of cells including monocytes and bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (2Aiuti A. Webb I.J. Bleul C. Springer T. Guierrez-Ramos J.C. J. Exp.

It is the only known ligand for CXCR4, a 7-transmembrane receptor that has been variously described as LESTR (7Loetscher M. Geiser T. O'Reilly T. Zwahlen R. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 232-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HUMSTR (8Federsppiel B. Duncan A.M.V. Delaney A. Schappert K. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F.R.

Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3643) Google Scholar). Consistent with this dual role of CXCR4, SDF-1 blocks HIV-1 entry into CD4+ cells (10Oberlin E.

The SDF-1 sequence indicates that it belongs to the CXC family of chemokines, but it has only about 22% identity with other chemokines (5Bleul C.C. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Casasnovas J.M. Aiuti A. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Despite the divergent primary structure, the recently described three-dimensional structure indicates that it has a similar fold to other chemokines (12Crump M. Gong J.-H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Furthermore, structure-activity analysis of SDF-1 (12Crump M. Gong J.-H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) indicated the importance of N-terminal residues 1–8 for binding and of residues 1 and 2 for receptor activation. Residues 12–17 located in the loop region also contribute to binding. In the SDF-1 structure, the region N-terminal to the CXC motif is highly disordered, but the loop region immediately following the CXC motif is well defined at least in its backbone atoms. These two regions have been identified as being important in other CC and CXC chemokines (12Crump M. Gong J.-H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L.

Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). As with other chemokines, N-terminal modification of SDF-1 led to dissociation of binding and activity (12Crump M. Gong J.-H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Thus despite the difference in primary structure, from both a structural and a functional perspective, the general mechanism of receptor binding is similar for SDF-1 and other chemokines. The key role of the N-terminal region of the SDF-1 protein in receptor binding and activation suggests that the N-terminal region alone could be sufficient for binding or activity. Here we show that peptides corresponding to the N-terminal region bind CXCR4 and have SDF-1 activity. A dimer of SDF-1, 1–9 was the most potent of the peptides tested. The peptides were prepared as described previously (13Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16075-16081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides were purified by HPLC and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Tertiary butyloxycarbonyl-α-aminobutyric acid was used to prepare the analog SDF-1, 1–9[Aba 9], which had CH2-CH3 in place of CH2SH. The 1–9 and 1–17 peptides were dimerized via a disulfide bridge formed by gentle oxidation of the cysteines using 10% Me2SO in water. Following HPLC purification dimer formation was verified by mass spectrometry. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from donor blood buffy coats by centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque. The cells were treated with phytohemagglutinin (1.0 μg·ml−1) and expanded in the presence of interleukin-2 (100 units·ml−1) for 7–17 days as described (16Loetscher P. Seitz M. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These cells are referred to as “T lymphocytes.” CEM cells, a human lymphoblastoid CD4+ T cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA), was cultured in RPMI medium containing 15 μg·ml−1 of 8-azaguanine (Aldrich) and 10% fetal calf serum. Migration of T lymphocytes was assessed in 48-well chambers (NeuroProbe, Cabin John, MD) using collagen-coated polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes with 3-μm pores (16Loetscher P. Seitz M. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Migrated cells were counted in five randomly selected fields at 1000× magnification after migration of 1 h. Disposable Transwell trays (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with 6.5-mm diameter chambers and membrane pore size of 3 μm were used to assay chemotaxis of CEM cells. The agonist, in Hepes-buffered RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 mg·ml−1 bovine serum albumin (0.6 ml), was added to the lower well, and 0.1 ml of CEM cells (1 × 107·ml−1) in the same medium without agonist was added to the upper wells. In some experiments the monoclonal antibody 12G5 (Ref. 17Endres M.J. Calpham P.R. Marsh M. Ahuja M. Davis-Turner J.C. Knight A. Thomas J.F. Stoebenau-Haggarty B. Choe S. Bance P.H. Wells T.N.C.

The antibody was also added to the lower well at 10 μg·ml−1. After 2 h, cells that migrated to the lower wells were counted. Chemotactic migration was determined by subtraction of cells migrated in medium alone. All assays were performed in duplicate. Competition for binding of125I-labeled SDF-1 to CEM cells was carried out as described (12Crump M. Gong J.-H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). MCP-1 and RANTES binding was measured on THP-1 cells as documented elsewhere (14Gong J.-H. Uguccioni M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10521-10527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). T lymphocytes and CEM cells loaded with Fura-2 were stimulated with the indicated agonist, and the [Ca2+]i-related fluorescence changes were recorded from 0–60 s (18von Tscharner V. Prod'hom B. Baggiolini M. Reuter H. Nature. 1986; 324: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Receptor desensitization was tested by monitoring changes during sequential additions at 60-s intervals. Where indicated the cells were preincubated with the 12G5 antibody prior to chemokine treatment. The N-terminal region of SDF-1 is directly involved in receptor recognition and activation (12Crump M. Gong J.-H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), and therefore we tested peptides corresponding to the N-terminal region for activity. The sequences of the peptides are shown in Fig. 1. Both the 1–8 and 1–9 peptides induced dose-dependent chemotaxis of CEM cells (Fig. 2 a). The concentrations required for 50% of the maximal response (EC50) are summarized in Table I. The 1–9 peptide was about 1,000-fold less potent than native SDF-1. However, the 1–9 was 7-fold more potent than the 1–8 peptide. The peptides were also tested on T lymphocytes (Fig. 2 b), and the results were similar to those obtained with CEM cells, except that the T lymphocytes were less responsive to SDF-1 or the peptides. The results clearly show that the 1–9 and 1–8 peptides have SDF-1 like activity but relatively low potency. The chemoattractant activity of 1–9 was fully inhibited by the SDF-1 antagonist, SDF-1, 1–67[P2G] (12Crump M. Gong J.-H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), but not by an interleukin-8 antagonist that blocks CXCR1 (19Jones S.A. Dewald B. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16166-16169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 a). These findings suggest that despite its lower potency the 1–9 peptide is similar in its mechanism of CXCR4 activation to native SDF-1.Figure 2Chemoattractant activity of SDF-1 peptides. a, migration of CEM cells in response to the SDF-1 peptides: 1–8 (■); 1–9 (▵); 1–17 (×); 1–9 dimer (▴); and 1–9[Aba] (⊞); 1–9[P2G] dimer (▪), and native SDF-1 (•). b, migration of T-lymphocytes: 1–8 (■), 1–9 (▵), 1–9 dimer (▴), and native SDF-1 (•).

Data are the means ± S.D. of duplicate determinations from two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore the possibility that the low potency of the N-terminal peptides is because of its lack of an independent second binding site, we tested whether activity could be enhanced by co-addition of a folded fragment corresponding to SDF-1, 9–67, which lacks residues 1–8. Thus the entire SDF-1 structure was available to the receptor but as two separate molecules. SDF-1, 9–67 alone did not bind CXCR4 at the concentrations used (12Crump M. Gong J.-H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis, mobilization of cytosolic free calcium, and receptor binding of 1–8 or 1–9 were not affected by the addition of SDF-1, 9–67 (not shown). Thus no synergy could be demonstrated. This does not rule out the possibility that a second site could be involved in full-length SDF-1. We tested two possible mechanisms that could account for the difference in activity between the 1–9 and 1–8 peptides. The first was whether 1–9 forms a super active dimer. This hypothesis was advanced when we detected dimer in solutions of 1–9. The second was whether the increase in length was responsible. To determine whether the extra residue in 1–9 was responsible for its higher potency we prepared 1–9[Aba-9] a monomer analog of 1–9 with Cys-9 replaced by Aba, a nonthiol-containing amino acid. This peptide had similar activity to the 1–8 peptide (Fig.2 a). To examine the possibility that the 1–9 formed a dimer with higher potency, we oxidized 1–9 and isolated the disulfide bridged dimer. The purified 1–9 dimer had a higher potency than 1–9 (10-fold), 1–17 (4-fold), 1–8 (75-fold), or the 1–9[Aba-9] monomer analog (36-fold) (Fig. 2 and Table I). The activity of 1–9 dimer was still 100-fold less potent than native SDF-1. To investigate the effect of increasing the peptide length to include both the N-terminal CXC motif and RFFESH binding domains, we prepared SDF-1, 1–17. This peptide was more potent than 1–9 but was severalfold lower than chemotactic activity than 1–9 dimer (Fig.2 a). Dimerization of 1–17 did not affect its potency (not shown). CEM cells were used to determine the binding of the SDF-1 peptides to CXCR4 (12Crump M. Gong J.-H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The competition for binding of 125I-labeled native SDF-1 by unlabeled native SDF-1 and the N-terminal peptides is shown in Fig.4. The Kd values are summarized in Table I. The competition by both the 1–8 and 1–9[Aba-9] peptides was incomplete, so a reliableKd could not be determined. The 1–9 dimer peptide had 82-fold lower affinity than native SDF-1. In comparison the 1–9 peptide had 1500-fold lower affinity than native SDF-1. The affinity of the 1–17 monomer and the 1–9 dimer were very similar (Fig. 4 and Table I). In contrast to the 1–9, the dimer of 1–17 was not significantly different from the 1–17 monomer (not shown). TheKd values for the 1–9 forms approximately corresponded with the chemotaxis results. To determine whether the 1–9 dimer binds to other chemokine receptors, competition for MCP-1 or RANTES binding to THP-1 cells was measured. THP-1 cells express CXCR4 as well as a number of CC chemokine receptors, including receptors for MCP-1 and RANTES. Like native SDF-1, the peptides did not compete for the binding of either MCP-1 or RANTES (not shown). A low molecular weight antagonist for SDF-1 could provide a lead for therapeutics. We had previously shown that a full-length analog, SDF-1, 1–67[P2G], is a potent receptor antagonist (12Crump M. Gong J.-H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested the corresponding 1–9 analog, SDF-1, 1–9[P2G], and found that its dimer lacked detectable activity (Fig. 2 a), but it competed for SDF-1 binding with similar affinity to 1–9 dimer (Fig. 4). The 1–9[P2G] dimer inhibited SDF-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 b). 50 μm of 1–9[P2G] dimer was required to inhibit the activity of 10 nm of SDF-1 by 50%, a ratio of 5,000. Therefore, as with full-length SDF-1 (12Crump M. Gong J.-H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), this modification converted the 1–9 into an antagonist. Thus we have identified a peptide antagonist of CXCR4. Native SDF-1 and the N-terminal peptides induced a rapid and transient rise in cytoplasmic calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i, in T lymphocytes (Fig. 5 a) as well as CEM cells (Fig. 6). The rate and magnitude increased with the concentration. Whereas a response to SDF-1 was observed at 1 × 10−9m, the peptides induced [Ca2+]i changes in the micromolar range. Receptor usage by the SDF-1 peptides was assessed by monitoring [Ca2+]i changes after sequential stimulation. As shown in Fig. 5 a, treatment of T lymphocytes with SDF-1 completely abolished the responsiveness to the 1–9 peptide, and conversely, the 1–9 peptide also markedly attenuated the response to native SDF-1. The 1–9 dimer (50 μm) completely desensitized the response to subsequent native SDF-1 (not shown). No effect on the response to the 1–9 peptide was observed when T lymphocytes were pre-stimulated with MCP-1, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, γ-interferon inducible protein-10, or monokine induced by interferon-γ (Fig. 5 b). The selectivity of these chemokines (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar) implies that SDF-1 peptides desensitize CXCR4 but not other chemokine receptors including CXCR3 and CC chemokine receptors 1, 2, and 5. No response to eotaxin, I-309, or thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (Fig. 5 b) was obtained with these cells under the conditions used, and as expected, they did not desensitize 1–9.Figure 6CXCR4 selectivity of the SDF-1, 1–9 dimer. a, chemotaxis of CEM cells in response to SDF-1 (5 nm) or SDF-1, 1–9 dimer (1 μm) was measured in the presence or absence of anti CXCR4 monoclonal antibody 12G5 (10 μg·ml−1). b, CEM cells that were either pretreated with antibody or untreated were loaded with Fura– 2 and stimulated with SDF-1 (3 nm) or SDF-1, 1–9 dimer (10 μm), followed by 100 nm secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC) after 60 s. The Ca2+-dependent changes in fluorescence were recorded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Specificity of the peptides was further examined using a CXCR4 blocking monoclonal antibody (17Endres M.J. Calpham P.R. Marsh M. Ahuja M. Davis-Turner J.C. Knight A. Thomas J.F. Stoebenau-Haggarty B. Choe S. Bance P.H. Wells T.N.C. Power C.A. Sutterwala S.S. Doms R.W. Landay N.R. Hoxie J.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The chemotaxis and calcium induction by SDF-1 and SDF-1, 1–9 dimer were blocked by the antibody (Fig. 6). The response of a control chemokine, secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine, which does not bind CXCR4, was not affected by the antibody (Fig.6 b). Taken together these data show that the 1–9 peptide binds and activates CXCR4 and demonstrate that it is specific for CXCR4. We have shown that N-terminal SDF-1 peptides bind and activate CXCR4. Peptides corresponding to 1–8, 1–9, 1–9 dimer, and 1–17 bind and activate CXCR4 but have low potency compared with SDF-1. Apart from their potency, the agonist peptides were indistinguishable from SDF-1 in all the activities measured. The same substitution, P2G, converted SDF-1 and the 1–9 dimer to a specific SDF-1 antagonist. The binding and activities of the N-terminal peptides were blocked by an antibody directed to CXCR4, confirming that the peptides bind CXCR4. Although residues in the N-terminal region of chemokines are critical for receptor activation, N-terminal peptides that have been tested do not bind and stimulate chemokine function. This study demonstrates that SDF-1 is an exception. There are several possible reasons for the difference between SDF-1 and other chemokines. A substantial body of work had lead to a model in which there are two chemokine receptor-binding sites, and the initial interaction occurs with a site in the loop region that follows the CXC or CC motif (12Crump M.

Dewald B. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), our data indicate that this is not essential for the SDF-1 peptides. Alternatively, the lack of binding of the N-terminal peptides of other chemokines is because of the failure to adopt a receptor bound conformation. The1H NMR structure of SDF-1 shows that the N-terminal region is entirely solvent-accessible and has no detectable secondary structure and therefore is expected to be highly flexible. However, it is reasonable to propose that the N-terminal region adopts a well defined conformation when SDF-1 binds to CXCR4. Similarly for the N-terminal peptide, the receptor bound conformation could be represented in solution. Nevertheless a prerequisite for binding of the N-terminal peptide to CXCR4 is that the receptor-binding site must be accessible. For other chemokines there is no evidence that this site is accessible. One possibility is that for binding of the N-terminal domain, other chemokine-receptor interactions are first required. This exposes the receptor site and allows the N-terminal domain to bind. In this model N-terminal peptides would not bind. In CXCR4 the loops of the receptor could be arranged such that this binding site is accessible to the peptide, whereas for most chemokines even if the N-terminal peptide existed in the bound conformation the pathway to the receptor could be stericly blocked without the remainder of the chemokine. Thus the difference between SDF-1 and other chemokines might not be in the peptide ligand but in the receptor. The affinity and potency of the N-terminal SDF-1 peptides are lower than those of the native protein. Thus the peptides can bind CXCR4, but not as efficiently as native SDF-1. Similar arguments to those above could account for the difference in potency. The low affinity could be because of the lack of the loop-binding site on the N-terminal peptide or because of multiple conformations of the peptide and/or a requirement for binding cooperativity in SDF-1. The disulfide-linked dimer of SDF-1, 1–9 peptide was considerably more potent than the 1–9 peptide monomer. Although 1–9 was isolated as the monomer it had higher activity than an analog that could not dimerize, suggesting that the 1–9 spontaneously starts to form dimer in solution. In native SDF-1, Cys-9 normally participates in a disulfide bridge. Thus, the disulfide bridge itself could directly enhance binding to the receptor. A second alternative is that dimerization could change the conformation of the 1–9 resulting in an enhanced binding. The fact that native SDF-1 binds as a monomer and not as a dimer (12Crump M. Gong J.-H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) indicates that only one 1–9 can bind to the receptor site. A third possibility is that one half of the dimer binds the activation site, but the other half could bind to other receptor sites, perhaps because of fortuitous complementarity. This last mechanism is consistent with the finding that the 1–17 has similar binding to the 1–9 dimer. The 1–17 contains the RFFESH motif, which is a receptor-binding site on SDF-1. Further experiments will be required to determine the detailed mechanisms involved. Stable low molecular weight nonpeptide ligands are preferred for therapeutic applications. SDF-1 is the ligand for a co-receptor for HIV and is involved in hemopoietic cell homing. Several nonchemokine molecules have been found to inhibit HIV, and it was shown that they target CXCR4 (22Doranz B.J. Grovit-Ferbas K. Sharron M.P. Mao S.-H. Goetz M.B. Daar E.S. Doms R.W.

Antagonists of chemokines are likely to be the most useful variants for therapeutic usage, and we have demonstrated that modification to N-terminal sites of several chemokines, including SDF-1, results in antagonists. SDF-1, 1–9[P2G] dimer is the first peptide chemokine antagonist. Many 7-transmembrane receptors have small molecule natural ligands and have been successfully targeted by analogs to generate pharmaceutical compounds. However, protein ligands such as chemokines, which have larger binding surfaces and depend on cooperative interactions, present a more complex chemical problem. The results with SDF-1 peptide antagonists indicate that it would be feasible to target the N-terminal region. These peptides could be leads for the generation of low molecular weight high affinity CXCR4 agonists or antagonist.

To study the mechanism, we examined how cav-1 scaffolding domain peptide (amino acids 82–101; cav-1P) would affect NO synthesis, NADPH oxidation, cytochrome c reduction, and ferricyanide reduction by full-length eNOS or its isolated oxygenase and reductase domains. Cav-1P equivalently inhibited NO synthesis and NADPH oxidation by full-length eNOS in a manner reversible by CaM but did not affect NADPH-independent NO synthesis by full-length eNOS or its oxygenase domain, indicating inhibition required the reductase domain. Similar concentrations of cav-1P inhibited cytochromec reduction by full-length eNOS or the reductase domain (amino acids 492–1205) in a CaM-reversible manner, indicating cav-1P interaction with reductase or full-length eNOS are equivalent. Ferricyanide reduction was unaffected by cav-1P in all cases. Immunoblotting showed that full-length eNOS, eNOS oxygenase, and eNOS reductase all bound to an immobilized glutathioneS-transferase-cav-1 fusion protein. Thus, cav-1 interacts independently with both oxygenase and reductase domains of eNOS. The reductase interaction occurs independent of a cav-1 binding motif, is CaM-reversible, and is of sufficient affinity to match cav-1P inhibition of NO synthesis by full-length eNOS. We propose that cav-1 binding to eNOS reductase compromises its ability to bind CaM and to donate electrons to the eNOS heme, thereby inhibiting NO synthesis.

In addition to being controlled by Ca2+-dependent CaM binding, eNOS catalysis and cellular localization are influenced by a surprising number of post-translational modifications.

The chief structural component of caveoli are a group of 21–24-kDa integral membrane proteins designated caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3. Caveolin-1 (cav-1) is abundant in endothelium and consists of N- and C-terminal cytosolic domains separated by a 33-residue membrane-spanning region. A component of its C-terminal membrane proximal segment termed the scaffolding domain (amino acids 82–101) is responsible for attachment of a number of signal proteins to the caveoli, including G subunits, Ha-Ras, the Src family tyrosine kinases, and eNOS (16Okamoto T.

Significantly, the inhibition of eNOS NO synthesis by cav-1 or cav-1P can be completely reversed by CaM, even though cav-1 does not interact with CaM itself or with the eNOS CaM binding site (17Ju H.

Although other possible modes of cav-1 inhibition remain to be explored, and it is unclear how cav-1 binding to the oxygenase domain could affect CaM binding at a separate site, the proposed mechanism is attractive because loss of CaM binding should prevent the reductase-oxygenase domain interactions that enable electron transfer to the heme iron, and thus inhibit NO synthesis.

We therefore explored the basis of cav-1 inhibition by determining its effect on various domain-specific catalytic activities, utilizing both full-length eNOS (eNOSFL) and its individual oxygenase (eNOSox) and reductase (eNOSr) domains.

The assay solution (0.7 ml final volume) consisted of 40 mm EPPS (pH 7.4), 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 25 nm NOS protein, 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase (SOD), 100 units/ml catalase, 4 μm FAD, 4 μm FMN, 4 μmH4B, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 15 μg/ml CaM, 1.4 mml-Arg, 0.3 mm NADPH, and 5 μmoxyhemoglobin. In most cases, NOS protein with or without CaM plus various amounts of cav-1P, cav-x, or vehicle were added to the reaction mix, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then for 5 min at 37 °C prior to initiating the reaction by adding NADPH. Initial experiments showed this incubation time was sufficient to reach equilibrium regarding cav-1P inhibition of eNOS activities. Catalysis of nitrite production by eNOSFL or eNOSox from the reaction intermediateN ω-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHA) in an NADPH-independent, H2O2-supported reaction was assayed in 96-well microplates at 37 °C as described previously (29Pufahl R.A.

Assays (100 μl final volume) contained 60 mm EPPS, pH 7.5, 250 nm NOS protein, 1 mm NOHA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm H2O2, 25 units/ml SOD, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 4 μm H4B. Some incubations also contained 0.7 mm CaCl2and 10 μg/ml CaM. NOS proteins, CaM, and various concentrations of cav-1P, cav-x, or vehicle were preincubated as described for the NO synthesis assay prior to initiating the reaction with H2O2. The reaction was stopped after 10 min by adding 1300 units of catalase. Nitrite was detected by adding Griess reagent (100 μl), the absorbance at 550 nm was recorded using a thermomax microplate reader, and the nitrite quantitated using NaNO2 standards. The consumption of NADPH at 37 °C was monitored at 340 nm in cuvettes assuming an ε340 = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. The reaction solution had the same volume and composition as that for the NO synthesis assay, except eNOS protein concentration was 50 nm, oxyhemoglobin was omitted, and the NADPH concentration was 0.15 mm. NOS proteins, CaM, cav-1P, cav-x, or vehicle were preincubated as described above prior to initiating the reaction with NADPH. Wavelength and extinction coefficients used to quantitate the NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c and ferricyanide were 550 nm (21 mm−1cm−1) and 420 nm (1.2 mm−1cm−1), respectively. The assays were performed in 96-well plates (150 μl final volume) or in cuvettes (0.7 ml final volume) as described previously (6Presta A. Liu J. Sessa W.C. Stuehr D.J.

In some cases 0.7 mm CaCl2 and 10 μg/ml CaM were also added. eNOS protein concentrations were 25 nm and 100 nm in the cytochrome cand ferricyanide reactions, respectively, whereas iNOSFL concentration was 10 nm in the cytochrome c assay. NOS proteins, CaM, cav-1P, cav-x, or vehicle were preincubated as described above prior to initiating the reaction with NADPH. The apparent Km for cytochrome creduction by eNOSr in the presence of 0.5 μm CaM plus or minus 2.5 μm cav-1P was determined by measuring the initial rate of cytochrome c reduction in microwell assays as described above. Rates were determined using cytochrome cconcentrations of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 μm. Cav-1P under these conditions inhibited eNOSr reduction of cytochrome c (100 μm) by ∼50%. Reciprocal rate and concentration values were plotted to determine apparent Km values. GST or purified GST-cav-1 fusion protein was bound to glutathione-agarose beads and the beads were then washed three times in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml BSA, and the following protease inhibitors: 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. These beads contained ∼150 pmol of GST or GST-cav-1 protein per 100 μl of packed volume. Washed beads containing 150 pmol of bound protein were incubated with 150 pmol of a given pure NOS protein by shaking at 4 °C overnight in 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% CHAPS, 2 mg/ml BSA, plus the protease inhibitors listed above. Beads were then washed six times with the above buffer, and bound NOS proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% acrylamide) and Western blot analysis with polyclonal (rabbit) anti-eNOS antibody (Affinity BioReagents). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used to visualize bound primary antibodies by enhanced chemiluminescence. For eNOSox, a Ni-NTA conjugate that binds to 6-histidine tagged proteins was used for detection and was stained with a nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate staining solution from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cav-1P (residues 82–101) represents the scaffolding domain of cav-1 and has been shown to inhibit eNOSFL NO synthesis (17Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol.

Using pure recombinant eNOS, we confirmed the ability of cav-1P to inhibit NO synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1 A), with EC50∼3 μm in the presence of Ca2+ and 0.5 μm CaM. We also observed a similar inhibition profile for eNOSFL NADPH oxidation by cav-1P under identical assay conditions (Fig.1 A). Neither activity was inhibited by the cav-x control peptide (data not shown). This indicates cav-1P does not uncouple eNOSFL NADPH oxidation in the process of inhibiting NO synthesis and instead inhibits both NADPH oxidation and NO synthesis together. Because both of these reactions depend on electron transfer to the heme, cav-1P may act by blocking this process. Indeed, inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity was almost completely reversed by adding excess CaM (Fig. 1 B), which triggers electron transfer from the reductase domain to the heme in eNOSFL (6Presta A. Liu J. Sessa W.C. Stuehr D.J. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). NAME, an l-Arg analog that inhibits eNOSFL heme reduction by lowering the iron redox potential (6Presta A. Liu J. Sessa W.C. Stuehr D.J.

Soc. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar), antagonized CaM rescue of activity, confirming CaM functioned to restore reductase domain-mediated heme iron reduction. The mechanism of cav-1P inhibition was further examined in experiments that measured NO synthesis from NOHA by either eNOSox or eNOSFL in an assay that is independent of reductase domain-mediated heme reduction. In this system, cav-1P was completely unable to inhibit NO synthesis either by eNOSFL or eNOSoxy in the presence or absence of added CaM (Fig. 1 A). Its inability to affect oxygenase domain catalysis held even though this domain contains a consensus binding site for cav-1 and therefore is thought to be the site of its binding (16Okamoto T.

Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). We conclude that cav-1P does not directly inhibit the activity of the eNOS oxygenase domain but instead can only inhibit eNOSFL catalysis when it depends on electron transfer from the reductase domain to the heme, consistent with cav-1P antagonizing the CaM-dependent electron transfer function of the reductase domain. We next examined the effect of cav-1P on two reductase domain-catalyzed reactions, NADPH-dependent cytochromec or ferricyanide reduction (4Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol.

Because a consensus cav-1 binding motif is not present in the eNOS reductase domain, we expected that cav-1P would not affect these activities. However, as shown in Fig. 2, A andB, cav-1P significantly inhibited cytochrome creduction by eNOSFL and its isolated reductase domain (eNOSr) in the presence of Ca2+ and 0.5 μm CaM, with an EC50 of ∼3 μm for both proteins. The CaM-independent cytochrome c reductase activities of eNOSFL and eNOSr were also inhibited by cav-1P over the same concentration range (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating the inhibition need not involve CaM. Cav-x peptide did not inhibit in any case, indicating specificity of action. In contrast to its potent effect on eNOS cytochrome c reduction, cav-1P did not inhibit ferricyanide reduction by eNOSFL or eNOSr at any concentration tested (Fig. 2, A and B). Because ferricyanide likely receives electrons from the FAD or FMN group of eNOSr, while cytochrome c only receives electrons from the terminal FMN group (4Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J.

We explored the basis for the action of cav-1P by comparing theKm for cytochrome c reduction by eNOSr in the presence and absence of 2.5 μm cav-1P. This gave apparent Km values of 21 and 28 μm, respectively (data not shown), indicating that cav-1P does not antagonize eNOSr interaction with cytochrome c. Thus, an interaction of cav-1P with the eNOS reductase domain inhibits its rate of electron transfer to cytochrome c, and this occurs at cav-1P concentrations equivalent to those that inhibit NO synthesis and NADPH oxidation by eNOSFL. Cav-1P inhibition of eNOSFL or eNOSr cytochrome c reduction could be fully reversed by adding excess CaM (Fig. 2, B andD), matching the characteristic pattern observed for CaM rescue of eNOSFL NO synthesis and NADPH oxidation (Fig. 1 B) (21Michel J.B.

That reductase domain catalysis is under opposing control by cav-1P and CaM was further evidenced by cav-1P only slightly inhibiting cytochrome c reduction by iNOSFL or its isolated reductase domain (iNOSr) (Fig. 2, A andC), 2iNOSFL NO synthesis was not inhibited over the same cav-1P concentration range (S. Ghosh, unpublished results). which both contain tightly bound CaM (32Ruan J. Xie Q. Hutchinson N. Cho H. Wolfe G.C. Nathan C. J. Biol.

To confirm that cav-1 affects eNOSr catalysis through a direct binding interaction, we examined binding of eNOSFL and its isolated domains to a GST-cav-1 fusion protein (17Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J.

As shown in the Western blot of Fig.3, left panel, eNOSr bound to the immobilized GST-cav-1 fusion protein, as indicated by the band at ∼78 kDa, but did not bind to immobilized GST alone. Specific binding was also observed for eNOSFL (135-kDa band, left panel) and for eNOSoxy (50 kDa band, right panel), as previously reported (17Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 18Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol.

Thus, in addition to interacting with the eNOS oxygenase domain, cav-1 specifically binds eNOSr, implying a direct binding interaction is responsible for cav-1 inhibition of reductase domain catalysis. Our data show that cav-1 specifically interacts with both the reductase and oxygenase domains of eNOS. Its interaction with eNOSr was unexpected, because the reductase domain does not contain a consensus binding motif for cav-1 that is present in the bovine eNOS oxygenase domain (F350 XXXXFXXW) and in several other proteins known to interact with cav-1 (16Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 22Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). The eNOSr interaction with and response to cav-1P (or cav-1) occurred in the absence of the oxygenase domain, indicating they are independent of the cav-1 binding motif in eNOSox. Our data appear to contradict a yeast 2-hybrid study that suggested no interaction occurs between eNOSr and cav-1P (17Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The basis for this discrepancy is unclear. Although the mechanism by which cav-1 regulates eNOS NO synthesis is still unclear (20Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), the following data reveal that cav-1 interaction with eNOSr is of primary importance. 1) The concentration of cav-1P required for 50% inhibition of eNOSr cytochrome creduction, as well as the extent of inhibition, match the concentration response for cav-1P inhibition of eNOSFL NO synthesis observed here or reported by others (17Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 18Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25437-25440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). 2) Cav-1P reversibly inhibits eNOSr cytochrome c reduction by antagonizing CaM activation of eNOSr, identical to the mechanism by which cav-1P reversibly inhibits eNOSFL NO synthesis (17Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 18Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25437-25440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) and NADPH oxidation (Fig. 1). Thus, the cav-1-CaM antagonism that is characteristic of eNOS inhibition (21Michel J.B. Feron O. Sase K. Prabhakar P. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25907-25912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) can take place within the context of the reductase domain alone. 3) The consequences of cav-1P inhibition of eNOSr is a slowing of electron transfer to a heme protein acceptor (cytochrome c). A similar diminished flow of electrons to the oxygenase domain of eNOSFL would be expected to slow NO synthesis and NADPH oxidase activity, which is exactly what is observed. The concept that cav-1P primarily functions to slow electron flow from the reductase is supported by the ability of excess CaM to reestablish normal electron flow to the eNOSFL heme, as manifest by its recovery of heme-dependent NADPH oxidase activity and NO synthesis. This in turn suggests the means by which CaM rescues cav-1-inhibited eNOSFL is through enhancing reductase domain electron transfer. Because eNOS heme reduction is thought to be the slow step in its NO synthesis (33Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), eNOS may be particularly susceptible to agents like cav-1 that slow electron flow from the reductase domain. Although cav-1P interaction with eNOSr clearly down-regulates its catalysis, the consequences of cav-1 interaction with the eNOS oxygenase domain are not as clear. On the basis of our current results, we know that cav-1P does not affect the activity of eNOSox or eNOSFL when their NO synthesis occurs independent of the reductase domain. This suggests that cav-1 has no gross effect on l-Arg, H4B, or O2 utilization by eNOS. A recent study showed that a mutant eNOSFL containing a dysfunctional cav-1 oxygenase binding motif maintained greater NO synthesis activity when coexpressed with cav-1 than wild-type eNOSFL (19Garcia-Cardena G. Martasek P. Masters B.S.S. Skidd P.M. Couet J. Li S. Lisanti M.P. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25437-25440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), suggesting the oxygenase cav-1 binding motif is required to inhibit eNOSFL. Conceivably, cav-1 binding to the oxygenase motif could affect CaM binding to eNOSFL, or affect interaction between the oxygenase and reductase domains, but direct evidence for these actions is unavailable, and our current data indicate that the cav-1-CaM antagonism can be completely explained within the context of eNOSr. All of these findings can be reconciled in a model presented in Fig. 4. The model broadens the scope of the cav-1 eNOSFL interaction to include distinct cav-1 interaction sites on the oxygenase and reductase domains. We envision an interaction between cav-1, the reductase, and oxygenase domains may form a ternary complex that localizes a CaM-deficient, catalytically compromised eNOS to the caveoli. Our current results suggest that cav-1 interaction with the reductase domain is primarily responsible for antagonizing CaM binding and for slowing electron transfer from the reductase, thus inhibiting heme iron reduction and NO synthesis, whereas cav-1 interaction with the oxygenase domain may help target the eNOSFL-cav-1 complex to caveoli (20Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), and have as yet unspecified effects on catalysis. Although many details remain to be addressed, our model provides a starting point for experiments that further define cav-1 interactions with both eNOS domains and its mechanism of inhibition. We thank members of Dr. Okamoto's laboratory for helpful advice concerning GST-cav-1, Dr. Bill Sessa of Yale University for providing bovine eNOSFL cDNA, and Drs. Husam Abu-Soud and Dipak Ghosh for helpful advice and discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2045673924,Anomalous double-pulse teleseismic P -wave arrivals were observed at one station near the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The azimuthal dependence of the waveform distortion and its absence at nearby stations indicated that the distortion was produced by receiver-side crustal heterogeneity. Modeling of the three-component data revealed a 15- to 20-kilometer Moho offset that occurs over a narrow lateral range of less than 5 kilometers. This east-west–striking offset separates the thick Tibetan Plateau crust from the Qaidam Basin crust. Such a sharp crustal thickness change implies a weak Tibetan Plateau crust that thickens vertically in response to penetration by India from the south and to blockage caused by a strong Qaidam Basin crust to the north.
https://openalex.org/W1997945154,"We have previously characterized the release of the signal peptide sequence-less fibroblast growth factor (FGF) prototype, FGF-1, in vitro as a stress-induced pathway in which FGF-1 is released as a latent homodimer with the p40 extravesicular domain of p65 synaptotagmin (Syn)-1.

These data suggest the following: (i) FGF-1 is associated with Syn-1 and S100A13 in vivo; (ii) S100A13 may be involved in the regulation of FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 release in response to temperature stress in vitro; and (iii) the FGF-1 release pathway may be accessible to pharmacologic regulation.

Whereas the stress-induced FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1-containing extracellular aggregate is not biologically active and binds poorly to immobilized heparin (5Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S.

It is possible that the latent character of this FGF-1 aggregate may represent a physiologic safeguard to ensure that extracellular FGF-1 can only signal if the extracellular environment is appropriate for the cell to respond to its stimuli; otherwise, it would be rapidly cleared. Indeed, cell-surface-associated heparin-sulfate proteoglycans are thought to not only present FGF-1 to its high affinity receptor tyrosine kinase (10Friesel R.E. Maciag T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) but also to protect FGF-1 from degradation by proteolytic enzymes present in the extracellular milieu during cell migration and proliferation (11Gospodarowicz D.

Because FGF-1 is released in response to heat shock in vitroas a reducing agent and denaturant-sensitive aggregate with p40 Syn-1 (5Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Garfinkel S. Mouta Carreira C. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Gamble S. Mouta Carreira C. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22217-22223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether FGF-1 and Syn-1 also exist as an aggregate in vivo in order to provide a physiologic correlate to the in vitro data. Since neural tissue has served as the traditional source of native FGF-1 (14Maciag T. Cerundolo J. Ilsley S. Kelley P.R. Forand R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5674-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and early evidence suggested that FGF-1 is present in neural tissue as an acid-sensitive high molecular weight aggregate (15Maciag T. Hoover G.A. Weinstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5333-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 could be resolved as a heparin-binding aggregate from neutral extracts of neural tissue. We report that brain-derived FGF-1 exists as a multiprotein aggregate with p40 Syn-1 and S100A13, a member of the S100 gene family of calcium-binding proteins (16Wicki R. Schafer B.W. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) and have been able to utilize a pharmacologic strategy to illustrate that S100A13 may be a functional component of the FGF-1 release pathway. Amlexanox (also known as AA673, Amoxanox, and Solfa) and its three derivatives were a very generous gift of Dr. G. Goto from Takeda Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan. All other chemicals were reagent-grade and obtained from Sigma except where otherwise indicated. Chromatography solvents were HPLC-grade and obtained from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against recombinant human FGF-1 and rat p40 Syn-1 were prepared as described previously (5Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Garfinkel S. Mouta Carreira C.

All antibodies were used for immunoblot analysis at a concentration of 4 μg/ml in blocking buffer as described previously (2Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) except that an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for protein detection. Ten (1.5 kg) unstripped ovine brains (Pel-Freeze® Biologicals, Rogers, AR) were homogenized in 1.3 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 2 min in a Waring blender. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 1 h, and the supernatant was filtered through sterile gauze. The filtrate was subjected to stepwise salt fractionation with 50 and 95% (NH4)2SO4 saturation, and the precipitates were collected by centrifugation as described (14Maciag T. Cerundolo J. Ilsley S. Kelley P.R. Forand R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5674-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The 95% (NH4)2SO4 saturation precipitate was resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and dialyzed for 18 h against 50 volumes of the resuspension buffer using a Spectra/Por (Mr 12–14,000) dialysis membrane (Spectrum Medical Industries Inc., Houston, TX). All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. A 2.5 × 22-cm plastic column containing 25 ml of hydrated heparin-Sepharose CL-6B was equilibrated with 10 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and the brain extract was adsorbed twice over the immobilized heparin. The column was washed with at least 10 bed volumes of the resuspension buffer until the absorbance of the eluate at λ = 280 nm was less than 0.01. Three batch fractions were eluted with 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.4 m NaCl, 0.7 m NaCl, and 1.5 mNaCl, and samples from each NaCl eluate (25 ml) were adsorbed to a C4 column (VydacTM, Hesperia, CA) conditioned in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce). RP-HPLC was performed as described (18Burgess W.H. Mehlman T. Friesel R. Johnson W. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11389-11392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (40 to 100%) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the effluent was monitored at λ = 214 nm. Samples were collected as absorbance peaks independent of volume in 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in an attempt to maintain aggregate integrity and analyzed by FGF-1 and Syn-1 immunoblot analysis as described (2Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 5Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S.

Although many peaks exhibited the presence of both FGF-1 and Syn-1 by immunoblot analysis, only the 1.5m NaCl heparin-Sepharose elution fraction contained a unique absorbance peak that contained both FGF-1 and Syn-1 by immunoblot analysis at a dilution of 1:100. This peak was re-chromatographed on a microbore 300-Å C4 Aquapore RP300 column (Perkin-Elmer), and bound proteins were eluted as absorbance peaks at λ = 214 with a linear gradient (40–100%) of 70% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Approximately 10 μg of protein from the indicated peaks in Fig. 1, B and C, were subjected to proteolytic digestion using lysyl endopeptidase C (Boehringer Mannheim) as described (73Egerton M. Burgess W.H. Chen D. Druker B.J. Bretscher A.S. Samelson L.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1847-1852PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were isolated by RP-HPLC using an Applied Biosystems model 130 separation system. Isolated peptides were subjected to automated Edman degradation using either an Applied Biosystems model 473A or 477A protein sequenator. Proteins were identified by comparison of the amino acid sequences obtained for several of these peptides against an NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) protein sequence data base using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) program. NIH 3T3 cell FGF-1 [2] transfectants and FGF-1:β-gal and p65 Syn-1 co-transfectants (13LaVallee T. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Mouta Carreira C. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22217-22223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were grown to 80% confluence on fibronectin-coated dishes and subjected to temperature stress (41.5 °C, 90 min) under the conditions previously described (74Shi J.P. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1142-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Where indicated, various concentrations of either amlexanox or one of its chemical derivatives were present during the entire heat shock period. A stock solution of amlexanox was freshly prepared in equimolar NaOH, and serial dilutions in phosphate-buffered saline were prepared prior to addition to the cells as recommended by Takeda chemical Industries Ltd. The compounds were added in volumes of 160 μl/20 ml of medium. The same volume of NaOH without drug was also added to the cells and found to have no effect on either protein release, membrane permeability (lactate dehydrogenase activity), or cell viability. In addition, cells maintained at 37 °C in the presence or absence of amlexanox for the same period were used as a control. Conditioned media were collected and filtered through 0.2-μm cellulose acetate. Aliquots (300 μl) were taken for analysis of lactate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity in the conditioned media according to an adaptation of the original method of Bergmeyer (75Bergmeyer H.-U. Bergmeyer H.-U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1965: 736-743Crossref Google Scholar) and Sigma procedure DG1340-UV. The remaining filtrate was treated with fresh 0.1% (w/v) dithiothreitol for 2 h at 37 °C and processed by heparin-Sepharose chromatography as described (2Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Extracts of ovine brain were prepared at a neutral pH and subjected to (NH4)2SO4precipitation (50 and 95% saturation) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 95% (NH4)2SO4 saturation precipitate was resuspended as described previously (18Burgess W.H. Mehlman T. Friesel R. Johnson W. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11389-11392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated into three batch-eluted fractions (0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 m NaCl) by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Whereas immunoblot analysis of each eluate revealed the presence of both FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 in all three fractions, only the 1.5 m NaCl post-heparin-Sepharose eluate was able to produce a reversed phase (RP)-HPLC peak (Fig. 1A) that contained both FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). The presence of p40 Syn-1 in the 1.5 m NaCl post-heparin-Sepharose elution fraction was unexpected since recombinant p40 Syn-1 has been observed to elute at a lower (∼0.6m NaCl) ionic strength [5]. To ensure that the post-RP-HPLC heparin-binding fraction containing both FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 did not contain additional non-associated proteins, this fraction was again subjected to analysis by RP-HPLC. As shown in Fig.1 B, RP-HPLC analysis revealed a single symmetrical peak with a retention time identical to that previously observed (Fig.1 A). Immunoblot analysis using FGF-1 and Syn-1 antibodies confirmed the presence of both FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 in this sample (Fig. 2, A andB). Since this fraction (Fig. 1 B) contained both FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 and the electrophoretic mobility of the FGF-1:Syn-1 aggregate released in response to temperature stress is denaturant-sensitive (5Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Garfinkel S. Mouta Carreira C. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22209-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we anticipated that treatment of this fraction with a chaotropic agent should resolve the FGF-1 and Syn-1 components as individual peaks with RP-HPLC retention times identical to their retention times defined by both the native (Fig. 1 A) and recombinant (Fig.1 D) proteins. Therefore, the brain-derived, post-RP-HPLC fraction (Fig. 1 B) containing both FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 was heated (5 min, 95 °C) in the presence of 8.0 m guanidine HCl and analyzed by RP-HPLC. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the fraction containing both FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 was present, but its absorbance was reduced significantly. In addition, numerous fractions with distinct retention times were readily visible including a major absorption peak and fractions previously defined as FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 (Fig. 1, A and D). These data suggest that thermal and guanidine HCl denaturation of the brain-derived post-RP-HPLC fraction (Fig. 1 B) containing both FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 generates additional fractions with different retention times including peaks with retention times identical to FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1. Thus it is likely that this brain-derived, heparin-binding fraction represents an aggregate that contains FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 as well as other temperature- and chaotropic-sensitive components. Since the major absorption fraction containing both FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 (Fig.1 B) demonstrated an unknown retention time, we sought to determine its structure. However, automated Edman degradation of this peak failed to yield any information. Therefore, this fraction (Fig.1 B) was subjected to LysC digestion, and the peptides were resolved by RP-HPLC. Automated Edman degradation of these peptides demonstrated that this fraction contained a member of the S100 gene family (17Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), the ovine homolog of human S100A13 (16Wicki R. Schafer B.W. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the structure of the S100A13 protein predicted from the bovine (GenBankTM accession number AB001567), murine, and human cDNA sequences (16Wicki R. Schafer B.W. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) suggests that S100A13 contains 98 amino acid residues, 9 of which have cyclic side chains that absorb in the far-UV area used for detection (19Goldfarb A.R. Saidel L.J. Mosovich E. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 397-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wetlaufer D.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1962; 17: 303-390Crossref Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Thus, the high UV absorbance feature of the FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 aggregate (Fig. 1 B) may be due in part to the extinction coefficient of S100A13 (Fig. 1, C andD). Since it was possible to resolve a single fraction from RP-HPLC whose retention time was altered by treatment with temperature and the chaotropic agent, guanidine HCl, we suggest that S100A13 is a component of a multiprotein FGF-1- and p40 Syn-1-containing aggregate and that S100A13 is also present in this aggregate as a protein with a blocked amino terminus. It is important to note that the major absorption peak in Fig.1 C, resulting from the denaturation of the fraction (Fig.1 B) containing FGF-1, p40 Syn-1, and S100A13, exhibited a distinct retention time, yet immunoblot analysis of this major absorption peak demonstrated the presence of low levels of FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 (data not shown). Since members of the S100 gene family are known to self-associate (21Naka M. Qing Z.X. Sasaki T. Kise H. Tawara I. Hamaguchi S. Tanaka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and to associate with membrane phospholipids (22Donato R. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), it is possible that the major absorption peak in Fig. 1 B may contain S100A13 aggregates as well as other peptidic and non-protein components such as acidic phospholipids. Thus, denaturation of the multimeric aggregate in Fig. 1 Bcontaining p40 Syn-1, S100A13, and FGF-1, with temperature and treatment with guanidine HCl resulted in only a partial disruption of the aggregate. In addition, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the FGF-1, p40 Syn-1, and S100A13-containing peak resolved in Fig. 1,A and B, is the result of nonspecific protein aggregation under RP-HPLC conditions. However, it is noteworthy that recombinant S100A13 elutes from immobilized heparin between 0.2 and 0.4m NaCl (data not shown), and recombinant p40 Syn-1 elutes from heparin-Sepharose at 0.7 m NaCl (5Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Garfinkel S. Mouta Carreira C. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22209-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since the brain-derived, post-heparin-Sepharose fraction containing p40 Syn-1, FGF-1, and S100A13 was isolated as a high affinity (1.5 mNaCl elution peak) heparin-binding fraction prior to resolution by RP-HPLC, it is likely that S100A13 and p40 Syn-1 gained high heparin binding affinity through their ability to associate with FGF-1 prior to analysis by RP-HPLC. Interestingly, automated Edman degradation of the FGF-1 fraction (Fig.1 C) derived from treatment of the FGF-1, S100A13, and p40 Syn-1 aggregate (Fig. 1 B) with temperature and guanidine HCl also failed to yield information. However, automated Edman degradation of LysC fragments derived from the FGF-1 peak (Fig. 1 C) demonstrated that it was present as a protein with a blocked amino terminus that has previously been characterized as FGF-1β (residues 1–154) (23Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, however, it was not possible to collect sufficient material from the p40 Syn-1 peak described in Fig.1 C for structural analysis, but it was possible to confirm the identity of this peak by Syn-1 immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Likewise, automated Edman degradation of the remaining peaks described in Fig. 1 C did not yield any information, and sufficient material was not available for analysis by LysC digestion. These data imply that the ovine brain-derived, heparin-binding and denaturant-sensitive aggregate resolved by RP-HPLC (Fig. 1 B) contains at least FGF-1β, p40 Syn-1, and S100A13. Furthermore, these data also provide an in vivo correlate to the presence of FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 as a denaturant-sensitive aggregate that is released into the extracellular compartment in response to temperature stress in vitro (5Tarantini F.

Because (i) S100A13 was purified as an aggregate with FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 from ovine brain, (ii) elevated FGF-1 levels are associated with inflammatory environments in vivo (24Sano H. Forough R.

As shown in Fig.3, A and B, amlexanox was able to repress the release of both FGF-1:β-gal and p40 Syn-1 in response to temperature stress. The inhibition of FGF-1:β-gal and p40 Syn-1 release was dependent upon the concentration of amlexanox and was within the concentration range that exhibits pharmacologic effects as an anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory agent (27Saijo T.

Similar amlexanox concentrations were also able to inhibit the release of FGF-1 from FGF-1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants in vitro (Fig. 5). Because of the possibility that amlexanox may also possess broad inhibitory activity upon conventional cellular secretion, we evaluated the ability of amlexanox to repress the release of a synthetic form of FGF-1 engineered to enter into the conventional ER-Golgi-mediated secretion pathway (30Forough R.

Although we previously cloned a human homologue (renamed as GSPT1) of the yeast gene, it has remained to be determined whether GSPT1 also functions as eRF3 or if another GSPT may have such a function in mammalian cells. In the present study, we isolated two mouse GSPT genes, the counterpart of human GSPT1 and a novel member of the GSPT gene family, GSPT2. Both the mouse GSPTs had a two-domain structure characterized as an amino-terminal no-homologous region (approximately 200 amino acids) and a carboxyl-terminal conserved eukaryotic elongation factor-1α-like domain (428 amino acids). Messenger RNAs of the two GSPTs could be detected in all mouse tissues surveyed, although the level of GSPT2 message appeared to be relatively abundant in the brain. The mouse GSPT1 was expressed in a proliferation-dependent manner in Swiss 3T3 cells, whereas the expression of GSPT2 was constant during the cell-cycle progression. Immunoprecipitation assays in COS-7 cells expressing flag epitope-tagged proteins demonstrated that not only GSPT1 but also GSPT2 was capable of interacting with eRF1. Such interaction between GSPT2 and eRF1 was also confirmed by yeast two-hybrid analysis.

Cell-cycle progression is regulated by a variety of genes at the G1 to S phase transition (1Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar, 2Morgan D.O.

Shimatake H. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Gst1 is a cdc-like mutant whose execution point is distal to the mating factor-sensitive step. In this mutant, DNA synthesis was substantially arrested at the nonpermissive temperature. It thus appeared that the GST1 gene product play an essential role at the G1 to S phase transition in the yeast cell cycle. On the other hand, SUP35 (SUP2) was cloned by another group investigating omnipotent suppressor mutant ofS. cerevisiae, and the gene turned out to be identical toGST1 (4Kushnirov V.V. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Telckov M.V. Surguchov A.P. Smirnov V.N. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 66: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).

Beretetskaya Y.V. Fominykch E.S. Pospelova E.M. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 111: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Eustice D.C. Wakem L.P.

We previously cloned a human homologue (renamed as GSPT1) of the yeast gene and reported that there is a functional conservation of the gene from yeast to human; GSPT1 could complement the gst1 mutation of S. cerevisiae (9Hoshino S. Miyazawa H. Enomoto T. Hanaoka F. Kikuchi Y. Kikuchi A. Ui M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3807-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between the yeast cell-cycle control and translational regulation by theGST1/SUP35 gene product has remained to be determined. elongation factor 1α a GTP-binding protein appearing to be essential for the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle elongation and release factors involved in protein synthesis, respectively polymerase chain reaction rapid amplification of cDNA ends kilobase(s). elongation factor 1α a GTP-binding protein appearing to be essential for the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle elongation and release factors involved in protein synthesis, respectively polymerase chain reaction rapid amplification of cDNA ends kilobase(s). In eukaryotic protein synthesis, termination codons are directly recognized by a polypeptide chain releasing factor, eRF1, to release synthesized polypeptide chain from ribosome, and another releasing factor, eRF3, is essentially required for the ribosomal binding of eRF1. Although the molecular entity of eRF3 has remained unknown, the termination factor appears to act as a GTP-binding protein based on the analogy of prokaryotic RF3 (10Beaudet A.L. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Konecki D.S. Aune K.C. Tate W. Caskey C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4514-4520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported inS. cerevisiae (12Stansfield I. Jones K.M. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Poznyakovski A.I.

Le Guellec R. Inge-Vechtomov S. Kisselev L. Philippe M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4065-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) that the product of the GST1/SUP35 gene forms a ternary complex with SUP45, which is another member of omnipotent suppressors to function as eRF1. These findings allowed us to postulate that the previously identified human GSPT1 may also function as eRF3. However, our further studies revealed the existence of another GSPT gene in mammalian cells (14Ozawa K. Murakami Y. Eki T. Yokoyama K. Soeda E. Hoshino S. Ui M. Hanaoka F. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we have isolated two mouse GSPT genes, the counterpart of human GSPT1 and a novel member of the GSPT gene family, GSPT2. The two GSPTs were clearly distinct from each other in terms of the amino acid sequences, the expression during cell-cycle progression, and tissue distribution. Analyses using immunoprecipitation technique and yeast two-hybrid system indicated that not only GSPT1 but also the novel GSPT2 may form a binary complex with eRF1 to function as eRF3. Total cellular RNA was prepared from cells or tissues using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). For Northern blotting, 20 μg of RNA was denatured by heating at 65 °C for 5 min in 2.2m formaldehyde, 50% (v/v) formamide, and size-fractionated by 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred directly to nylon membrane filters. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in a solution containing 40% formamide, 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate), 3× Denhardt's solution (1× Denhardt's solution = 0.002% Ficoll, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% polyvinyl pyrrolidone), 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), and 100 μg/ml of heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed twice at room temperature in 2× SSC buffer, twice at 68 °C in 1× SSC buffer for 10 min per wash, and subjected to autoradiography. The plasmid carrying cDNA sequence for EF1α (PAN7) was a gift from Dr. Y. Kaziro (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan) and was used as the hybridization probe. Poly(A)+ RNA was separated from total cellular RNA by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography. Construction of λgt10 cDNA library was described previously (9Hoshino S. Miyazawa H. Enomoto T. Hanaoka F. Kikuchi Y. Kikuchi A. Ui M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3807-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from FM3A cells was converted into double-stranded cDNA by the RNase H method of Gubler and Hoffman (16Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar). Resultant double-stranded cDNA was blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase, treated with EcoRI methylase, ligated syntheticEcoRI linkers, and finally digested with EcoRI. The linker-ligated cDNA thus prepared was passed through a Sepharose CL-4B column to remove linker fragments and then inserted into phage λgt10 and packaged in vitro using Gigapack Gold (Vector Cloning System, San Diego, CA). Thus prepared bacteriophage particles were grown on Escherichia coli C600 Hfl. A total of 6 × 105 independent recombinant plaques was screened by the plaque-hybridization method (17Benton W.D. Davis R.W. Science. 1977; 196: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed overnight at 42 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, and heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed as described above and subjected to autoradiography. RACE PCR was performed on mouse brain Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using antisense primers specific for GSPT1 and GSPT2 according to the manufacturer's directions. The resulting PCR products were ligated into vector pUC18 and sequenced. Construction of GSPT-specific cDNAs was performed as follows. For GSPT1-specific cDNA, a cDNA fragment of GSPT1 corresponding to nucleotide residues 1529–1754 was synthesized by PCR using oligonucleotide primers, GSPT1–5′ (5′-primer) and GSPT1–3′ (3′-primer), with pGM19 as a template. A cDNA product of GSPT2 corresponding to nucleotide residues 411–544 was also synthesized using primers, GSPT2–5′ (5′-primer) and GSPT2–3′ (3′-primer), with pGM1 as a template. For EF1α-specific cDNA, a cDNA fragment of EF1α corresponding to nucleotide residues 1529–1754 was synthesized by PCR using oligonucleotide primers, EF-5′ (5′-primer) and EF-3′ (3′-primer) with pAN7 as a template. The three cDNA products were digested withPstI plus XhoI, HindIII plusKpnI, and EcoRI plus XhoI, respectively, and then subcloned into pBlueScript(SK−) vector under the control of T7 RNA polymerase promoter in the antisense orientation, resulting in pBSG1, pBSG2, and pBSE. pBSG1 was digested withBamHI to produce a 270-nucleotide cRNA. pBSG2 was digested with EcoRI to produce a cRNA of 159 nucleotides. pBSE was digested with BamHI to produce a 270-nucleotide cRNA. cRNA synthesis was performed using the protocol of the manufacturer (Ambion) in the presence of [32P]UTP and T7 RNA polymerase, followed by exhaustive DNase I digestion. Labeled transcripts were subsequently purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Briefly, after electrophoresis on 8 m urea, 5% polyacrylamide, the probe was cut off from the gel using the autoradiogram as a template. The gel slice was then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in a solution containing 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 0.2% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA. The RNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. Protection experiments were performed essentially as described (18Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (10 μg) was hybridized to 5 × 105 cpm of pBSG1 or pBSG2 cRNA at 42 °C for 16 h in a solution consisting of 80% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1m sodium citrate (pH 6.4), and 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 6.4). The hybridization mixture was then digested with RNase A and T1 at 37 °C for 30 min. After proteinase K digestion and ethanol precipitation, samples were run on a 8 m urea, 5% polyacrylamide gel. The radioactivity was measured with a Fuji BAS 2000 bioimaging analyzer. The synthetic oligonucleotide used were: GSPT1–5′/AACTGCAGCAGGAACCATCTGC; GSPT1–3′/TTCTCGAGAGGTTTGTCAATGG; GSPT2–5′/GGAAGCTTAAAGAAGTGAGTGA; GSPT2–3′/TTGGTACCTGATGGTATGGCCA; EF-5′/AAGAATTCTCAAGCCTGGC; and EF-3′/TTCTCGAGCAGTGAAGCCA. Randomly primed cDNA prepared from total RNA of various tissues was amplified by PCR using the sequence-specific primer, G13′ (GSPT1) or G23′ (GSPT2), and the common primer, G5′. Conditions of the PCR were held within the range of quantitative amplification to provide a relative measure of RNA content in the various samples. The synthetic oligonucleotide used were: G5′/ATTGAAGAGGAAGAGATTCTTCC; G13′/AAAGTAAGAGAAGGCGGTGTGAAGTAGGCTTTTGCA; and G23′/TGGGCAGTAGGTTGCGGTCA. Although mouse eRF1 (SUP45homologue) has not been cloned yet, eRF1 is highly conserved fromXenopus to human. Thus, human eRF1 (TB3–1), of which cDNA had been cloned from total RNA of HL60 cells by means of reverse transcription-PCR based on the sequence described previously (19Grenett H.E. Bounelis P. Fuller G.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 110: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with recent correction (20Frolova L. Le Goff X. Rasmussen H.H. Cheperegin S. Drugeon G. Kress M. Arman I. Haenni A.L. Celis J.E. Philippe M. Justesen J. Kisselev L. Nature ( Lond. ). 1994; 372: 701-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), was used as a counterpart in the present assay. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum and maintained at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. 10 μg each of various cDNAs, in which GSPT1, GSPT2, or TB3–1 had been fused in-frame with the flag epitope sequence of pFlag-CMV-2 expression vector (Eastman Kodak Co.), was added to the cells grown at a density of approximately 80% confluence per 90-mm dish with LipofectAMINETM in Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the standard procedure. After a 76-h culture, the transfected cells were harvested and then lysed by shaking for 30 min in 0.5 ml of an extraction buffer consisting of 20 mmNa-Hepes (pH 7.5), 75 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 15 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25 μg/ml of aprotinin. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 20 min, and the supernatant was precleared by incubating at 4 °C for 30 min with 20 μl of anti-mouse IgG agarose beads (50% slurry, American Qualex Inc.). After removal of the agarose beads, the supernatant was further incubated at 4 °C for 90 min with 20 μl of the agarose beads (50% slurry) conjugated with anti-flag tag monoclonal antibody M2 (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems). The agarose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of the extraction buffer, and proteins were eluted from the beads by adding 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and heating at 95 °C. An aliquot (15 μl) of the samples was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% polyacrylamide), and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Fluorotrans, Pall BioSupport Division). The membrane, after being shaken in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, was incubated with rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant human GSPT1 or TB3–1 at room temperature for 2 h and then further incubated with 125I-labeled protein A in TBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin. The radioactivity retained on the membrane was visualized with the Fuji BAS 2000 bioimaging analyzer. The cDNAs encoding TB3–1, GSPT1, and GSPT2 were fused in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding and/or transactivation domains using pGBT9 and pGAD424 expression vectors. A series of deletion and chimeric mutants of GSPTs were constructed using a PCR-based strategy. PCR products encoding amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal truncations of GSPT2 were subcloned into pGBT9 in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. For chimeric constructs, PCR products encoding amino-terminal regions of GSPT2 and the carboxyl-terminal region of GSPT1 were fused and subcloned into pGBT9 in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The two-hybrid vectors thus obtained were cotransformed into the SFY526 yeast host strain. Transformed colonies were replated on tryptophan- and leucine-deficient medium. Quantitative β-galactosidase assays were carried out as described previously (21Finkelstein D.B. Strausberg S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1625-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In brief, densities of cell culture grown at 30 °C in SD medium lacking leucine and tryptophan were measured by optical density at 600 nm, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.1 ml of Z buffer (82 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgSO4), and permeabilized by freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37 °C. After cells were diluted with 0.7 ml of Z buffer containing 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, reactions were started by adding 0.16 ml ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml in Z buffer), incubated at 30 °C for 10 min to 10 h, stopped by adding 0.4 ml of 1 m Na2CO3, then assayed by measurement of A420. β-galactosidase activity was calculated in Miller units (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) as 1,000 × (A420/A600) × culture volume (milliliter) × reaction time (min). In the course of investigating the expression of GSPT1 gene, we noticed there were at least two transcripts in mouse Swiss 3T3 cells, which were cross-hybridized with human GSPT1 cDNA probe; one was the same length (2.7 kb) as human GSPT1 transcript, and the other was approximately 2.6 kb (data not shown). Because the two transcripts were also found in mouse FM3A cells, we screened the FM3A cDNA library (approximately 6 × 105 primary recombinants) at reduced stringency with the human cDNA as a probe. Twelve positive clones were detected and isolated, and the DNA prepared was subcloned into pUC119 and analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping, resulting in two types of the restriction maps. Two independent clones, pGM19 and pGM1, which contain inserts of approximately 2.1 and 2.3 kb, respectively, were thus chosen and subjected to DNA sequencing analyses. The insert of pGM19 was composed of 2097 base pairs with an open reading frame of 1650 nucleotides (550 amino acids) starting from the 5′-end of the sequence followed by a stop codon at position 1653. The insert of pGM1 had 2311 nucleotides, which encodes an open reading frame of 612 amino acids with the putative translation termination codon at position 1839. The nucleotide sequences inserted in pGM19 and pGM1 were similar to each other and also to that of human GSPT1 gene (9Hoshino S. Miyazawa H. Enomoto T. Hanaoka F. Kikuchi Y. Kikuchi A. Ui M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3807-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To isolate the full-length cDNAs, 5′-RACE PCR was performed on a mouse brain cDNA library. Fragments amplified by RACE PCR extended 255 and 235 nucleotides further upstream of the cloned pGM19 and pGM1, respectively. These nucleotides encode other methionines corresponding to the initiation methionine identified in human GSPT1 (23Jean-Jean O. Legoff X. Phillippe M. C. R. Acad. Sci. ( Paris ). 1996; 319: 487-492PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the predicted amino acid sequences of the cDNA inserts of pGM19 and pGM1 that were extended by RACE PCR, together with the derived sequences of human GSPT1 and yeast GST1. This alignment indicated that the amino acid sequence of pGM19 is almost identical to that of human GSPT1 (94% identity). In contrast, the amino acid identity between pGM1 and human GSPT1 was significantly low (81% identity). The amino acid differences between the two mouse gene products were mostly observed in the amino-terminal one-third of the sequences. Because this is the first documentation of heterogeneity of the GSPT gene, we propose the tentative designation to this novel GSPT gene (pGM1) as GSPT2. To investigate the relationship between the present two mouse GSPT genes, their expressions were analyzed by an RNase protection assay with specific riboprobes (cRNA) constructed to the coding regions of the carboxyl-terminal GSPT1 and amino-terminal GSPT2. As shown in Fig. 2 A, there was a marked increase in GSPT1 transcript at 5 h upon stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with 5% fetal bovine serum, which was followed by a gradual decrease. In contrast, GSPT2 transcript did not fluctuate over the 25-h period after the serum stimulation. Similar results were obtained in the cells stimulated with phorbol ester (Fig.2 B). Thus, GSPT1 gene appeared to be inducible in response to growth stimulation, whereas GSPT2 is constantly expressed not dependent on the stimulation in the fibroblastic cells. We also examined the tissue distribution of GSPT1 and GSPT2 mRNAs in mouse. Both GSPT1 and GSPT2 were expressed in all tissues tested, though GSPT2 transcript was relatively enriched in the brain (Fig.3). The same results were obtained upon analysis by the RNase protection assay (data not shown).Figure 3Tissue distributions of GSPT1 and GSPT2 mRNAs in adult mice. Total RNA from various mouse tissues was reverse transcribed and PCR-amplified using primer pairs specific to GSPT1 and GSPT2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The size of the PCR products are 476 and 458 bp for GSPT1 and GSPT2, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recent studies in yeast (12Stansfield I.

To extend this notion to mammalian cells and assess the implication of the two mouse GSPT gene products in the termination reaction of protein synthesis, the association of GSPT1 and GSPT2 with eRF1 was investigated by immunoprecipitation assays in COS-7 cells expressing flag epitope-tagged proteins. The sequence of a flag monoclonal-antibody epitope was attached to the open reading frames of GSPT1, GSPT2, and eRF1 cDNAs to produce proteins that were composed of the flag epitope fused to the amino termini of the gene products. The expression vectors composed of the flag-tagged cDNAs under the control of CMV promoter were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and the cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-flag monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, an endogenous 54-kDa peptide, which was recognized by anti-TB3–1 (eRF1) antiserum, could be co-immunoprecipitated with the flag-tagged GSPT1 or GSPT2 (Panel B, lanes 1 and 2). On the other hand, several anti-GSPT antiserum-reactive peptides of approximately 90 kDa were observed upon immunoprecipitation of the flag-tagged TB3–1 (Panel A, lane 3). Such direct interaction between eRF1 and GSPT was further confirmed by the yeast two-hybrid assay system (24Fields S. Song O. Nature ( Lond. ). 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar, 25Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). The varying length of GSPT2 and the full-length TB3–1 gene were cloned downstream of the GAL4-binding (pGBT9 vector) and activation (pGAD424 vector) domains, respectively, and the resulting plasmids were transformed into theS. cerevisiae SFY526 cells. The activity of the β-galactosidase reporter was assayed quantitatively by the standard procedure (21Finkelstein D.B. Strausberg S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1625-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, there was strong interaction between the full-length mouse GSPT2 (1–632) and the human eRF1. Significant interaction between GSPT1 and eRF1 was also detectable if the more sensitive yeast strain Y190 was used instead of SFY526 (data not shown). Because the mouse GSPT2 gene product significantly interacted with eRF1, we further analyzed the functional domains with the varying length of GSPT2 in the yeast two-hybrid assay system. When 35, 109, and 135 amino acids were deleted from the amino terminus of GSPT2 ((36–632), (110–632), and (136–632), respectively), their interactions with eRF1 were progressively reduced. Moreover, GSPT2 gene products (36–427) deleted with carboxyl-terminal 205 amino acid residues also failed to interact with eRF1. These results suggested that not only the amino-terminal region of GSPT2 but also its carboxyl-terminal region is involved in its association with eRF1. In the present study, we have identified a novel member of the GSPT gene family, GSPT2, which may function as the polypeptide chain release factor, eRF3, in the termination of mammalian protein synthesis. This is the first demonstration showing the heterogeneity of GSPT- (or eRF3-) related genes in eukaryotic cells. Mouse GSPT1 and GSPT2 genes were clearly distinct from each other in terms of their amino acid sequences (especially in their amino termini) expression during cell-cycle progression, and tissue distribution. In contrast to GSPT1, the expression of the novel GSPT2 gene was constant during the cell-cycle progression of 3T3 cells and was relatively abundant in mouse brain. Our previous study on the chromosome mapping of the GSPT1 gene suggested the existence of a homologous gene on the Xchromosome (14Ozawa K. Murakami Y. Eki T. Yokoyama K. Soeda E. Hoshino S. Ui M. Hanaoka F. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which may represent the locus of human GSPT2 gene. As has been reported previously, the yeast GST1/SUP35 gene product consists of two domains, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ones (Fig. 5). The amino-terminal domain consisting of 257 amino acid residues is unique for the yeast GST1/SUP35 and is also reported to be essential for the inheritance of the [psi +] phenotype (26Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Genetics. 1994; 137: 671-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Paushkin S.V. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3127-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the carboxyl-terminal domain (428 amino acids) is similar to EF1α and essential for the translation termination (28Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Didichenko S.A. Chernoff Y.O. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Smirnov V.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Recently, Jean-Jeanet al. (23Jean-Jean O. Legoff X. Phillippe M. C. R. Acad. Sci. ( Paris ). 1996; 319: 487-492PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the 5′-end of the open reading frame of human GSPT1 gene is longer than previously reported by 138 codons, indicating that the length of the amino-terminal domain (209 amino acids) of human GSPT1 is now close to that of the yeastGST1/SUP35 gene product. The two mouse GSPTs also had the amino-terminal domain consisting of approximately 200 amino acids. Thus, eukaryotic GSPT gene products appeared to be characterized as at least the two-domain structure, a unique amino-terminal region and the conserved EF1α-like carboxyl-terminal domain. A striking difference between mouse GSPT1 and GSPT2 is observed in the amino-terminal region, though their carboxyl-terminal domains are highly homologous in the primary structure. In the present study, interaction of eRF1 with the GSPT gene products was assessed using co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays. The results indicated that both GSPT1 and GSPT2 were able to bind eRF1. When the amino-terminal region of GSPT2 was deleted, the interaction was impaired. In addition, the carboxyl-terminal region of GSPT2 was also required for the interaction; GSPT2 deleted with the carboxyl-terminal 205 amino acids failed to bind eRF1. Thus, the data presented here clearly demonstrated that the GSPT2 gene product interacts with eRF1 directly and that at least two distinct regions of GSPT2 are required for its binding to eRF1. In the present study, we demonstrated significant interaction between GSPT gene products and eRF1. However, there was no obvious difference in the eRF1 binding properties between the two GSPTs. In prokaryotic cells, two release factors, RF1 and RF2, which correspond to eRF1, catalyze the termination reaction at UAA and UAG codons and UAA and UGA codons, respectively (29Craigen W.J. Lee C.C. Caskey C.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, a nonessential factor, RF3, appears primarily to function as an enhancer predominantly for the RF2-mediated termination at UGA codon (30Grentzmann G. Brechemier-Baey D. Heurgue-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10595-10600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Mikuni O. Ito K. Moffat J. Matsumura K. McCaughan K. Nobukuni T. Tate W. Nakamura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5798-5802Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, however, only eRF1 has been identified as the peptidyl release factor for the three termination codons, and both eRF1 and eRF3 appear to be essential and required to form a functional release factor complex (32Kisselev L.L. Frolova L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 33Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, we cannot totally rule out the possibility that a RF2-like termination factor(s) other than eRF1 may exist and interact efficiently with either of the GSPT gene products in eukaryotic cells. This notion might be supported by the findings that several genes related to eRF1/SUP45 were present in human genome (34Grenett H.E. Eipers P.G. Kidd V.J. Bounelis P. Fuller G.M. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In a previous study (9Hoshino S. Miyazawa H. Enomoto T. Hanaoka F. Kikuchi Y. Kikuchi A. Ui M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3807-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we reported that human GSPT1 is capable of complementing the temperature-sensitive growth of the yeastgst1 mutant, though the exact role of the yeastGST1/SUP35 gene product in the regulation of cell-cycle progression has remained unknown. This suggests that in mammalian cells either of the GSPT genes may participate in the regulation of cell cycle. Given that mouse GSPT1 gene expression is up-regulated at the G1 to S phase transition, in which GSPT2 gene expression is constant, GSPT1 might interact with a protein(s) other than eRF1-like factor, which regulates cell-cycle progression. The GST1gene, which exists in a single copy in yeast, might duplicate in evolution to generate functionally specialized GSPT genes (GSPT1 and GSPT2) in mammals. These possibilities concerning the presence of a novel interaction molecule(s) to GSPT gene products and the relationship between translation termination and cell-cycle regulation are currently under investigation in our laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W2000434897,"An intriguing development in the G-protein signaling field has been the finding that not only the Gα subunit, but also Gβγ subunits, affect a number of downstream target molecules. One of the downstream targets of Gβγ is adenylyl cyclase, and it has been demonstrated that a number of isoforms of adenylyl cyclase can be either inhibited or stimulated by Gβγ subunits. Until now, adenylyl cyclase type I has been the only isoform reported to be inhibited by free Gβγ. Here we show by transient cotransfection into COS-7 cells of either adenylyl cyclase V or VI, together with Gγ2 and various Gβ subunits, that these two adenylyl cyclase isozymes are markedly inhibited by Gβγ. In addition, we show that Gβ1 and Gβ5 subunits differ in their activity. Gβ1 transfected alone markedly inhibited adenylyl cylcase V and VI (probably by recruiting endogenous Gγ subunits). On the other hand, Gβ5 produced less inhibition of these isozymes, and its activity was enhanced by the addition of Gγ2. These results demonstrate that adenylyl cyclase types V and VI are inhibited by Gβγ dimers and that Gβ1 and Gβ5 subunits differ in their capacity to regulate these adenylyl cyclase isozymes.—Bayewitch, M. L., Avidor-Reiss, T., Levy, R., Pfeuffer, T., Nevo, I., Simonds, W. F., Vogel, Z. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase isoforms V and VI by various Gβγ subunits. FASEB J. 12, 1019–1025 (1998)"

Early studies with FGF-1 demonstrated its presence in bovine brain as a novel high molecular weight complex, and subsequent studies identified a second heparin-binding protein that co-purified with FGF-1. Polypeptide sequence analysis revealed that this heparin-binding protein corresponded to the extravesicular domain of bovine synaptotagmin (Syn)-1, a transmembrane component of synaptic vesicles involved in the regulation of organelle traffic. Since FGF-1 is released in response to heat shock as a mitogenically inactive Cys-30 homodimer, we sought to determine whether this heparin-binding protein was involved in the release of FGF-1. We report that a proteolytic fragment of the extravesicular domain of Syn-1 is associated with FGF-1 in the extracellular compartment of FGF-1-transfected NIH 3T3 cells following temperature stress. By using heparin-Sepharose affinity to discriminate between the monomer and homodimer forms of FGF-1 and resolution by conventional and limited denaturant gel shift immunoblot analysis, it was possible to identify FGF-1 and Syn-1 as potential components of a denaturant- and reducing agent-sensitive extracellular complex. It was also possible to demonstrate that the expression of an antisense-Syn-1 gene represses the release of FGF-1 in response to heat shock. These data indicate that FGF-1 may be able to utilize the cytosolic face of conventional exocytotic vesicles to traffic to the inner surface of the plasma membrane where it may gain access to the extracellular compartment as a complex with Syn-1.

Analysis of the effects of brefeldin A on the release of FGF-1 in this system demonstrated the unconventional nature of the FGF-1 release pathway since disruption of endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi communication (3Lippincott-Schwartz J.

In addition, we have also reported the following: (i) FGF-1 is released as a latent homodimer with reduced affinity for immobilized heparin (5Tarantini F. Gamble S. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29039-29042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); (v) the release of FGF-1 involves the function of a carboxyl-terminal domain which is not present in FGF-2 (6Shi J. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1142-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); and (vi) the FGF-1 secretion pathway does not restrict the release of high molecular weight forms of FGF-1 since an FGF-1:β-galactosidase chimera is released as a structurally intact protein (6Shi J. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1142-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The ability of FGF-1 to interact with phosphatidylserine (5Tarantini F. Gamble S. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29039-29042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), an important component of the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (7Zachowski A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), implies that this interaction may play a role in its release. Finally, analysis of FGF-1 release using FGF-1:FGF-2 chimeric constructs demonstrated that FGF-1, but not FGF-2, is released in response to temperature stress (6Shi J. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1142-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Early studies on the purification of FGF-1 from bovine brain tissue demonstrated the presence of high and low molecular weight forms of the protein; the high molecular weight form of FGF-1 represents an acid-sensitive complex (8Burgess W.H. Mehlman T. Friesel R. Johnson W. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11389-11392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the characterization of brain-derived FGF-1 as a heparin-binding protein, a second polypeptide was identified that co-eluted with FGF-1 from immobilized heparin (8Burgess W.H. Mehlman T. Friesel R. Johnson W. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11389-11392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein was isolated, sequenced, and identified as the extravesicular portion of synaptotagmin (Syn)-1, an integral component of synaptic vesicles (9Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Syn-1 has been implicated in the regulation of exocytotic (9Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), we questioned whether Syn-1 may also be involved in the temperature-dependent release of FGF-1. We now report the presence of denaturant- and reducing agent-sensitive forms of FGF-1 and Syn-1 in media conditioned by heat shock from FGF-1-transfected NIH 3T3 cells and have identified a p40 fragment of Syn-1 as a potential component of the extracellular FGF-1 complex. Stable NIH 3T3 FGF-1 cell transfectants were obtained as described previously (2Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Conditioned medium was collected after temperature stress (42 °C for 2 h), processed by filtration, and activated with either (NH4)2SO4 (2Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K. Forough R.

Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The DTT-treated conditioned medium was adsorbed directly to a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), previously equilibrated with 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA (TEB), and the column was washed with TEB and eluted with TEB containing increasing concentrations of NaCl. The elution fractions were concentrated using a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon, Inc.) and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions, as described previously (4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The (NH4)2SO4-treated conditioned medium (90% saturation) was recovered by centrifugation (9,000 ×g, 40 min), resuspended in TEB, and processed over a 4-ml heparin-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with TEB. The column was washed with TEB and batch-eluted as 10-ml fractions with TEB containing increasing concentrations of NaCl. Each post-heparin elution fraction was divided into two samples to be analyzed by immunoblotting with either the anti-FGF-1 or the anti-Syn-1 antibodies. Each sample was divided again into two fractions of equal volume, concentrated using a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon, Inc.) to a final volume of 200 μl. Of the first 200 μl, half was resuspended in an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (125 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) containing 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) and resolved by 15% (w/v) conventional SDS-PAGE, and half was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer without 2-ME and resolved by 15% conventional SDS-PAGE. The second 200 μl were also divided in half, resuspended in an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer with and without 2-ME, and resolved using a limited denaturant electrophoretic gel shift system (15% (w/v) acrylamide), where SDS was present in the sample and running buffers but eliminated from the resolving gel (limited SDS-PAGE). Immunoblot analysis of the samples resolved by conventional and limited SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (2Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Briefly, after transfer to nitrocellulose filters, the filters were incubated in 24 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 136 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TCB) which also contained 5% (w/v) milk for 2 h at 42 °C and were then washed 3 times with TCB. The filters were probed with either a rabbit anti-human FGF-1 antibody (12Sano H. Forough R. Maier J.A. Case J.P. Jackson A. Engleka K. Maciag T. Wilder R.L. J.

The proteins were detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. A rat Syn-1 construct (p65IIs) encoding amino acid residues 96–421 in the expression vector pGEX-KG and two additional constructs, p65–123 (encoding amino acid residues 96–265) and p65–345 (encoding amino acid residues 248–421), as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were kindly provided by Dr. Richard Scheller (13Bennett M.K. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used for the preparation of antisera. The fusion proteins were generated and purified as described (13Bennett M.K. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that a 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.8, containing 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm glucose, and 10 μg/ml lysozyme was used to lyse BL21 Escherichia coli. The thrombin-cleaved proteins were further purified by adsorption to heparin-Sepharose previously equilibrated in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and eluted with a 0–1.5m NaCl gradient in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Female, 6-month-old, New Zealand White rabbits (Hazelton Research Animals) were injected intradermally with 1 mg of protein suspended in Freund's complete adjuvant (Calbiochem), boosted with 200 μg of protein suspended in incomplete Freud's adjuvant (Calbiochem), and the antibodies purified by incubating the serum with immobilized p65IIs on a Problot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) previously blocked at 42 °C with TCB containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The membrane was washed 3 times with 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNaCl, and the antibody was eluted from the membrane with 0.2m glycine, pH 2.8, and neutralized with 1 mK2HPO4, pH 7.4. For the analytical study of the recombinant Syn-1 heparin-binding affinity, 1 μg of thrombin-cleaved, p65IIs recombinant protein was adsorbed to a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose column, previously equilibrated with TEB. The column was washed with TEB and batch-eluted with 2.5 ml of TEB containing increasing concentrations of NaCl. The post-heparin elution fractions were concentrated by Centricon to a final volume of 50 μl and analyzed by conventional SDS-PAGE, under reducing conditions. The protein was detected by immunoblot analysis with a rabbit anti-rat Syn-1 antibody using the ECL detection system. Total RNA from FGF-1-transfected NIH 3T3 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (14Samuel C.E. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 54: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As described previously (15Garfinkel S. Haines D.S. Brown S. Wessendorf J. Gillespie D.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24375-24378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cDNA was obtained from 1 μg of total RNA and diluted to a final volume of 500 μl with H2O. PCR was performed on 5 μl of cDNA in a 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.3, containing 1 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2 units of Taq polymerase, and 0.5 μg/each of sense (5′-CCATTGCCACCGTGGGCCTT-3′) and antisense (5′-TCCAAAACAGTTACCACCAC-3′) oligonucleotide primers designed to recognize the human and the mouse Syn-1 sequences. PCR was performed for 35 cycles as follows: 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 54 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated from the oligonucleotide primers, unincorporated nucleotides, and Taq polymerase using a Qiagen tip-5 column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen PCR purification kit, Qiagen Inc.) and cloned into a pCR 2.1 vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The identity of the PCR fragments was then confirmed by sequencing using the dideoxy sequencing method (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). For the Syn-1 antisense gene construct, a rat Syn-1 gene into the PCB1 vector (a gift from T. C. Sudhof (16Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar)) was used to obtain the Syn-1 open reading frame that was cloned into a pCRTM II cloning vector (Invitrogen) by PCR method, using the following primers: 5′-GGGAGACACGGGATCCTTACTTCTTGACAGCCAG-3′ (sense oligonucleotide, containing a BamHI restriction site) and 5′-GCGACAGGAGCATATGGTGAGTGCCAGTCATCC-3′ (antisense oligonucleotide, containing a NdeI restriction site). A fragment encompassing the AUG initiator codon and the first 640 nucleotides of the rat Syn-1 sequence was obtained from the Syn-1/pCRTM II construct by digestion with the restriction enzyme EcoRI, filling with DNA polymerase I large (Klenow) fragment (Boehringer Mannheim) to obtain blunt ends, and a second digestion with KpnI restriction enzyme. The product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated (T4 ligase, Life Technologies, Inc.) in an antisense direction into HpaI/KpnI compatible ends of the eukaryotic expression vector p3′SS (LAC switch inducible mammalian expression system, Stratagene). The anti-Syn-1/p3′SS vector was transfected into NIH 3T3 FGF-1 transfectants using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. DMEM, containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Boehringer Mannheim) and 20% bovine calf serum, was used to select hygromycin-resistant colonies. Colonies were screened for the expression of the anti-Syn-1 gene by Northern blot analysis using the anti-Syn-1 fragment as probe. The FGF-1 transfectants and the FGF-1 and anti-Syn-1 co-transfectants were subjected to temperature stress as described previously (2Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Conditioned media were treated with 0.1% DTT and adsorbed over a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with TEB. The column was washed with TEB and the protein eluted with TEB containing 1.5m NaCl. The elution fractions were concentrated by Centricon, analyzed by conventional SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and immunoblotted with anti-FGF-1 antibody as described previously. The proteins recognized by the antibody were detected with an125I-protein A probe. For the growth assay experiments, FGF-1 transfectants and FGF-1 and anti-Syn-1 co-transfectants were plated on 6-well cell culture dishes at a concentration of 2 × 103 cells/well in DMEM, containing increasing concentrations of bovine calf serum (0–20%). When the effect of FGF-1 on the growth curve was analyzed, 5 ng/ml recombinant FGF-1 and 4 units/ml heparin were added to the culture medium. At day 7 the cells were trypsinized and counted with a Coulter counter. FGF-1 was purified by heparin-Sepharose affinity from bovine brain as described previously (8Burgess W.H. Mehlman T. Friesel R. Johnson W. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11389-11392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a second heparin-binding protein within the FGF-1 fraction, which eluted with FGF-1 at 1.0 m NaCl, was detected by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The co-eluted protein was characterized as a 40-kDa polypeptide by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to automated Edman degradation. Interestingly, the amino-terminal sequence of the p40 fragment corresponded to the extravesicular domain of synaptotagmin-1 (Syn-1) (9Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), starting in the α-helical stretch proximal to its transmembrane domain (Fig.1 A). Syn-1 has been described as a neuronal-specific, integral component of synaptic vesicles (9Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is considered to be the calcium sensor of the regulated neurotransmitter secretory pathway, and it displays potential docking properties through its syntaxin-binding domain (17Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 18Sollner T. Whiteheart W.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2611) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Syn-1 is also able to interact with the clathrin AP-2 adaptor, participating in the clathrin-coated pit endocytotic pathway (10Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Since Syn-1 expression is considered to be neuron-specific, we examined two non-neuronal cell culture systems for the presence of the Syn-1 transcript. Analysis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and FGF-1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using human and murine Syn-1 primers demonstrated the presence of the Syn-1 transcript in both cell types (Fig. 1 B). Sequence analysis of the human and murine RT-PCR products confirmed the identity of these fragments as human and murine Syn-1 (data not shown). In order to define further the mechanism utilized by FGF-1 for release, we employed stable FGF-1-transfected NIH 3T3 cells to determine whether the p40 proteolytic fragment of Syn-1 was present in medium conditioned by temperature stress. FGF-1 and Syn-1 immunoblot analysis was performed on heparin-Sepharose fractions of medium conditioned by FGF-1 transfectants during heat shock (42 °C, 2 h). Since FGF-1 is released as a FGF-1 Cys-30 homodimer (4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the conditioned medium was initially treated with 0.1% w/v dithiothreitol (DTT) and resolved by heparin affinity-based chromatography prior to conventional immunoblot analysis under reducing conditions. As shown in Fig.2 A, the FGF-1 monomer was detected in the high NaCl elution fractions (0.6 to 1.5 mNaCl). Because the FGF-1 homodimer has been shown to elute from immobilized heparin near 0.4 m NaCl (19Engleka K.A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11307-11315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and FGF-1 was undetectable in the low NaCl elution fractions (Fig. 2 A), we suggest that DTT treatment of media conditioned by heat shock was effective in reducing the FGF-1 homodimer to monomer. In addition, Syn-1 immunoblot analysis of the same heparin-Sepharose elution fractions by conventional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions also resolved the presence of a p40 fragment of Syn-1 in the high NaCl elution fractions (0.8 to 1.0m NaCl) (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that p40 Syn-1 and FGF-1 were both present in DTT-treated heat shock conditioned medium from FGF-1-transfected NIH 3T3 cells and define their respective heparin-Sepharose elution profiles. Since Syn-1 has been previously described as a heparin-binding protein with very high heparin affinity, eluting from immobilized heparin near 1.5 m NaCl (20Nishiki T. Kamata Y. Nemoto Y. Omori A. Ito T. Takahashi M. Kozaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10498-10503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to confirm its heparin-binding characteristics. A rat p40 Syn-1 fragment encoding amino acid residues 96–421, which is very similar to the extravesicular domain of the p40 Syn-1 fragment isolated from bovine brain (Fig. 1), was expressed as a prokaryotic recombinant protein, and its heparin affinity was examined. As shown in Fig.3, the recombinant form of rat Syn-1 eluted from heparin-Sepharose between 0.6 and 0.8 m NaCl (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that treatment of heat shock conditioned medium with DTT generates a p40 fragment of Syn-1 with heparin binding affinity similar to the prokaryotic recombinant p40 fragment. It has been demonstrated previously that the latent, dimeric form of FGF-1 released into conditioned medium under temperature stress is not biologically active in mitogenic assays and requires activation with either DTT or (NH4)2SO4 to restore its mitogenic potential (4Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Since DTT treatment of medium conditioned by heat shock is able to generate a p40 Syn-1 fragment with similar heparin affinity as that exhibited by the recombinant p40, we sought to determine the heparin elution profile of extracellular FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 when medium conditioned by temperature stress was treated with (NH4)2SO4. The samples obtained from heparin-Sepharose elution after treatment of conditioned medium with (NH4)2SO4 were independently examined for the presence of FGF-1 (Fig.4) and Syn-1 (Fig.5) by immunoblot analysis. Whereas immunoblot analysis performed after conventional SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions revealed the presence of monomeric FGF-1 in the low and high NaCl elution fractions (Fig. 4 A), the appearance of p40 Syn-1 was limited to the low NaCl elution fractions (Fig.5 A). In contrast, FGF-1 (Fig. 4 B) immunoblot analysis performed after conventional SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions demonstrated that the presence of the FGF-1 monomer was restricted to the high NaCl elution fractions and revealed the presence of high molecular weight FGF-1 immunoreactive bands in the low NaCl elution fractions (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, Syn-1 immunoblot analysis of the heat shock-conditioned, post-heparin-Sepharose samples resolved by conventional SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (Fig.5 B) also detected the presence of high molecular weight bands in the low NaCl elution fractions. These data indicate the following: (i) a p40 fragment of Syn-1, as well as FGF-1, is detected in the low NaCl elution samples of conditioned media treated with (NH4)2SO4, but not DTT, and (ii) the electrophoretic mobility of both FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 present in the low salt elution fractions is sensitive to the presence of reducing agent. Thus, it is likely that the monomeric forms of FGF-1 and Syn-1 detected as high affinity heparin-binding proteins in the high salt elution fractions of conditioned medium following DTT treatment may represent the reduced products of the low affinity heparin-binding forms of FGF-1 and Syn-1 present in the low NaCl elution fractions from medium treated with (NH4)2SO4.Figure 5Syn-1 immunoblot analysis of reducing agent- and denaturant-sensitive forms of Syn-1 in medium conditioned by heat shock after (NH4)2SO4 treatment and heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Heat shock CM from NIH 3T3 FGF-1 transfectants was collected, treated with (NH4)2SO4, and processed over a heparin-Sepharose column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions were collected, divided into two samples, and concentrated by Centricon to a final volume of 200 μl as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first sample"

Using a deletion mutant that lacks 95 amino acids from the extravesicular domain of synaptotagmin-1, neither synaptotagmin-1 nor FGF-1:β-gal are able to access the stress-induced release pathway. Furthermore, the p40 extravesicular fragment of synaptotagmin-1 is constitutively released in p40 synaptotagmin-1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants, and this release is potentiated when the cells are subjected to temperature stress. These data demonstrate that the p40 fragment derived from synaptotagmin-1 is able to utilize the FGF-1 non-classical exocytotic pathway and that the release of FGF-1 is dependent on synaptotagmin-1.

Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FGF prototypes are distinguished among the FGF family members by the absence of a classical signal peptide sequence to direct their secretion through the conventional endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi pathway. Because the FGF prototypes initiate their biological responses through the activation of high affinity receptors on the surface of target cells, it has been suggested that the secretion of both FGF-1 and FGF-2 may be regulated by novel release pathways. Indeed, the ligation of a signal peptide sequence to FGF-1 followed by somatic gene transfer, which results in the constitutive release of FGF-1, yields a functional oncogene in vitro and exaggerated vascular hyperplasia in vivo (2Forough R.

Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11389-11392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a heparin-binding protein (p40) that co-eluted with FGF-1 was identified by amino-terminal sequence analysis as a proteolytic fragment of the synaptotagmin-1 (Syn-1) translation product (8Burgess W.H. Mehlman T. Friesel R. Johnson W. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11389-11392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Syn-1 is a 65-kDa vesicular protein and has been most extensively studied in neuronal and endocrine cells. The Syn gene family currently consists of 11 members (9Sudhoff T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 10Kwon O.J. Gainer H. Wray S. Chin H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and is characterized by a divergent amino terminus, a transmembrane domain, a large cytoplasmic region, which is comprised of two repeats of sequences homologous to the protein kinase C C2 domain, and a highly conserved carboxyl terminus (11Perin M.S. Johnston P.A. Ozcelik T. Jahn R. Francke U. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 615-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The p40 proteolytic fragment identified in neural tissue corresponds to the extravesicular portion of Syn-1. Genetic and microinjection studies have suggested that Syn-1 is the Ca2+ sensor for neurotransmitter release (13Kelly R.B. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 257-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, our laboratory has identified the presence of the Syn-1 transcript and translation product in NIH 3T3 cells, as well as in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (14Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Garfinkel S. Mouta Carreira C. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22209-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have detected the p40 extravesicular portion of Syn-1 in the conditioned medium from FGF-1-transfected cells exposed to heat shock and have observed that the release of FGF-1 in response to temperature stress can be significantly attenuated by the expression of an antisense-Syn-1 construct (14Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Garfinkel S. Mouta Carreira C. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22209-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since these data indicate that Syn-1 may be involved in the non-classical secretion pathway employed by FGF-1, we used an established in vitro system (4Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) to study the properties of Syn-1 release. NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with a FGF-1:β-galactosidase (gal) chimera construct release the FGF-1:β-gal chimera as a structurally intact protein in response to temperature stress (15Shi J. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1142-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because the endogenous level of Syn-1 expression is low in NIH 3T3 cells, we used FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cells co-transfected with either p65 Syn-1 or a construct expressing the p40 extravesicular domain of the Syn-1 protein to study the release pathway used by these polypeptides. We report that the p40 extravesicular portion of Syn-1 is released from p65 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal co-transfectants in response to temperature stress with similar kinetics as FGF-1:β-gal. The release of both Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal is an ATP-driven process that requires transcription and translation but does not require a structurally intact ER-Golgi apparatus. Deleting 95 amino acids from the extravesicular domain of Syn-1 results in a mutant Syn-1 that is not released in response to temperature stress and also prevents the release of FGF-1:β-gal into the heat shock conditioned medium. Transfecting a construct encoding only the extravesicular domain of Syn-1 into FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cells results in the constitutive release of the p40 extravesicular fragment of Syn-1, and this release is potentiated when the cells are subjected to temperature stress. Although the constitutive release of p40 Syn-1 from these co-transfectants is not energy-dependent, the potentiated release requires ATP. However, both the constitutive release and the potentiated release are ER-Golgi-independent. Murine NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and stable NIH 3T3 FGF-1:β-gal cell transfectants were obtained as described previously (15Shi J. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1142-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector containing a gene encoding resistance to hygromycin and the coding sequence for rat p65 Syn-1 (amino acids 1–421) or rat p65-(del 120–214) or rat p40 Syn-1 (amino acids 119–421) containing a Myc tag. Co-transfectants were maintained in Dulbeccos's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum (BCS, HyClone), 1× antibiotic/antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 250 μg/ml hygromycin (Boehringer Mannheim) on human fibronectin (10 μg/cm2)-coated dishes. The p65 form of rat Syn-1 (a generous gift of T. C. Sudhof) was cloned into the PCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego) after generating an NdeI site at the amino terminus and a BamHI site at the carboxyl terminus by polymerase chain reaction. The Myc-tag (5′-GAACAAAAGCTTATTTCTGAAGAAGACTTG-3′) was ligated to the carboxyl terminus and consisted of a 10-amino acid (EQKLISEEDL) epitope recognized by the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (16Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The p65-(del 120–214) construct was made by removing the AflII-KpnI fragment from the p65 Syn-1 construct resulting in the loss of amino acids 120–214 and the addition of 3 amino acids (GID). The p40 form of rat Syn-1 was made by deleting the 5′ sequences at the AflII site and thus generated a construct that encoded for amino acids 119–421, which includes the C2A and C2B domains and the conserved carboxyl terminus, as well as the Myc tag. For transfection analysis p65 Syn-1, p65-(del 120–214) and p40 Syn-1 were cloned into the pMEXhygro vector. This vector was generated from the pMEXneo vector (17Martin G.M. Sprague C.A. Epstein C.J. Lab. Invest. 1970; 23: 86-92PubMed Google Scholar) by removing the StuI-NruI fragment containing the neomycin resistance gene and inserting a 1774-base pairHpaI-Eco3I fragment containing the hygromycin B resistance promoter and gene from the p3′SS vector (Stratagene). For heat shock, the transfected cells were grown to confluence in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) BCS and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic on human fibronectin (10 μg/cm2)-coated dishes; the cells were washed with DMEM containing 4 units/ml heparin (The Upjohn Co.) and subjected to heat shock (42 °C for 100 min) in DMEM containing 4 units/ml heparin and 0.5% BCS as described previously (4Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Three independent clones were tested for each transfection. In order to study the biochemical properties of secretion, prior to heat shock the transfectants were incubated at 37°C with either 10 μg/ml actinomycin D (2 h, added from a 1 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol; Sigma), 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (2 h, added from a 10 mg/ml stock solution in Me2SO; Sigma), 5 μg/ml brefeldin A (0.5 h, added from a 1 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol; Epicenter Technologies), 50 mm 2-deoxyglucose (1 h; Sigma), or 5 μmA23187 (Sigma); the transfectants were washed with DMEM containing 4 units/ml heparin and then subjected to heat shock (42 °C for 100 min) in DMEM containing 4 units/ml heparin and 0.5% BCS in the presence of the drug, except for A23187, which was performed as described under “Results.” Conditioned media were collected after temperature stress, processed by filtration, and activated with 0.1% (w/v) dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma) by incubating at 37 °C for 2 h (5Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The conditioned medium was adsorbed to a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA (TEB). The column was washed with TEB and then eluted with TEB containing 1.5m NaCl. The eluant was concentrated using a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon, Inc.) and analyzed by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described previously (5Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To examine the cell lysate, cells were collected, pelleted, and lysed in sample buffer; a fraction of the cell lysate was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Cell viability was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the conditioned medium after filtration as described by Bergmeyer (18Bergmeyer H.-U. Bergmeyer H.-U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1965: 736-743Crossref Google Scholar) (Sigma procedure DG 1340-UV). To determine total LDH activity cells were lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and sonicated. The debris was pelleted, a 1:80 dilution of the cell lysate was made, and LDH activity was measured. This value was used to determine the percent of LDH activity in the conditioned medium. Immunoblot analysis of the samples resolved by SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (4Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Briefly, after transfer to a nitrocellulose filter, the filters were incubated with 24 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 136 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TCB) that contained 5% (w/v) milk for 2 h at 42 °C. The filter was probed with either 5 μg/ml polyclonal anti-human FGF-1 antibody (19Sano H. Forough R. Maier J.A. Case J.P. Jackson A. Engleka K. Maciag T. Wilder R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) or 5 μg/ml polyclonal anti-rat Syn-1 antibody (14Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Garfinkel S.

The filter was washed with TCB and then visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Consistent with the results in cell lysates from NIH 3T3 cells that are not transfected with p65 Syn-1, which have been adsorbed to and eluted from heparin-Sepharose, the lysate from the p65 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants resolves several heparin-binding Syn-1 immunoreactive polypeptides as visualized by Syn-1 immunoblot analysis (compare Fig.1, A with B). Tunicamycin treatment and pulse-chase analysis of the p65 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants (data not shown) demonstrated that these polypeptides are partially due to differential N-glycosylation, an observation consistent with reports that Syn-1 isN-glycosylated and palmitoylated (20Bennett M.K. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chapman E.R. Blasi J. An S. Brose N. Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine the kinetics of release of Syn-1, p65 Syn-1 was stably transfected into FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell transfectants, and the heat shock-conditioned medium from the co-transfectants was collected and examined after adsorption to and elution from heparin-Sepharose. The p40 extravesicular fragment of Syn-1 was clearly detectable in the conditioned medium after 1.5 h at 42 °C (Fig.2 A). Supplementing the medium with protease inhibitors did not influence the generation of p40 Syn-1 (data not shown). Analysis of the heat shock-conditioned medium using FGF-1 immunoblot methods demonstrated that FGF-1:β-gal is also released with similar kinetics (Fig. 2 B). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was measured to demonstrate that the cells did not undergo significant lysis after the cells were subjected to temperature stress. We typically observed 5.6% of the total cell lysate LDH activity in the medium conditioned at 37 °C for 100 min and 8.5% of the total cell lysate LDH activity in the medium conditioned by heat shock (42 °C, 100 min).Figure 2The release kinetics of the extravesicular domain of Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal from NIH 3T3 cells in response to temperature stress. Lysate and conditioned medium from p65 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants were collected at various times and immunoblot analysis for Syn-1 (A) and FGF-1:β-gal (B) were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lanes 1 and 2 are the lysates from p65 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell transfectants at 37 °C (2 h) and 42 °C (2 h), respectively.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22209-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether Syn-1 release was dependent on FGF-1 expression. The p65 Syn-1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants, which have very low levels of endogenous FGF-1 and p65 Syn-1 NIH 3T3 cells co-transfected with a Cys-free mutant non-secreted form of FGF-1 (5Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), demonstrated that the release of p40 Syn-1 was similar to that observed in the p65 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants (Fig. 3,A and B). These data suggest that p40 Syn-1 release from the p65 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants in response to heat shock does not depend on the expression of high levels of cytosolic FGF-1 that is competent to enter the stress-induced release pathway. We have previously demonstrated that the release of FGF-1 is dependent on both transcription and protein synthesis because FGF-1 release is blocked by exposure to either actinomycin D or cycloheximide (4Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FGF-1 utilizes a non-classical release mechanism since its appearance in the extracellular compartment is not sensitive to treatment with brefeldin A (Fig.4 B, lane 3–5 (4Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar)). Thus, we analyzed the effects of actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and brefeldin A on the release of Syn-1. Consistent with the results obtained for the release of FGF-1 (4Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), we observed that the release of p40 Syn-1 is inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, and its release is insensitive to treatment with brefeldin A (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3–5). Additionally, FGF-1 is released into the heat shock conditioned medium as a latent low heparin-binding affinity complex that must be activated with either (NH4)2SO4 or DTT in order to bind immobilized heparin with high affinity (4Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 14Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Garfinkel S. Mouta Carreira C. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22209-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Heparin eluates of conditioned medium from temperature stress-induced p65 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants that are not activated by DTT contain lower levels of p40 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal (Fig. 4,A and B, lane 7). These results suggest that the secreted p40 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal exhibit reduced heparin affinity when the conditioned medium is not activated with DTT. It has been suggested that Syn-1 is the Ca2+ sensor during neurotransmitter release (22Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson G.W. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ATP and calcium have been demonstrated to play an important role in regulated exocytotic pathways. Thus, we sought to determine whether these cofactors play a role in the release of either Syn-1 or FGF-1:β-gal. To determine the ATP requirement for the release of these polypeptides, the NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants were subjected to heat shock in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose (dOG), an analog of glucose that inhibits glycolysis and thus the generation of ATP (23Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 63-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, A andB (lane 6), the release of both p40 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal in response to temperature stress was severely reduced in the presence of 2-dOG. To assess whether an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration would have an effect on FGF-1:β-gal and p40 Syn-1 release, the p65 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants were pretreated with the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, at 37 °C and then subjected to heat shock in the absence of the drug. Surprisingly, A23187 did not affect the release of either p40 Syn-1 (Fig. 5 A) or FGF-1:β-gal (Fig. 5 B) at 37 or at 42 °C. Additionally, treating the cells with the ionophore at 37 °C for up to 2 h did not stimulate the release of p40 Syn-1 or FGF-1:β-gal (data not shown). Unfortunately, we were unable to assess whether treating the cells with the ionophore for longer intervals during heat shock has an effect on either p40 Syn-1 or FGF-1:β-gal release since these conditions resulted in cell lysis. Ca2+ is generally considered to be a transient stimulant, and pretreating the cells prior to temperature stress may not deliver the increase in intracellular Ca2+ at the appropriate time. Therefore, we subjected the p65 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants to heat shock for 1.5 h, added the ionophore, and continued the heat shock in the presence of A23187 for 15 min. Similar to the pretreatment of the cells with the ionophore, delivering the Ca2+ signal 1.5 h into the heat shock had no effect on the release of either p40 Syn-1 or FGF-1:β-gal (data not shown). To investigate further whether Ca2+ might play a role in this release mechanism, a 95-amino acid deletion was made in p65 Syn-1 that deleted the Ca2+-binding site, the phosphatidylserine-binding domain, and the casein kinase II phosphorylation site (39Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 42Davktov B. Sontag J.M. Haya Y. Petrenko A.G. Fyske E.M. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6816-6822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.6 A). Similar to the p65 Syn-1 lysate, the p65-(del 120–214) lysate contained several immunoreactive Syn-1 polypeptides, including a 35-kDa fragment suggesting that the deletion mutant is competent to generate a soluble extravesicular domain (Fig. 6 B, lane 2). However, examining the heat shock conditioned medium of the p65-(del 120–214) and FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 co-transfectants showed that neither p65-(del 120–214) (Fig.6 B) nor FGF-1:β-gal (Fig. 6 C) was present in the extracellular compartment. These data suggest that this 95-amino acid region is required for both Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal to access the stress-induced release pathway. The detection of only the p40 extravesicular portion of p65 Syn-1 in the extracellular compartment suggests the function of a protease that may be important to relieve p65 Syn-1 from its transmembrane constraint. The activity of this protease may be induced by temperature stress and thus may be a regulated step in the Syn-1 exocytotic pathway. To determine whether the generation of the p40 proteolytic fragment of Syn-1 is regulated, we stably co-transfected a construct expressing the p40 extravesicular fragment of Syn-1 into the FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 transfectants and examined the conditioned medium for the presence of p40 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal prior to and after heat shock. Interestingly, we observed the constitutive release of the p40 Syn-1 fragment at 37 °C (Fig.7 A). In addition, we did not observe an increase in the release of FGF-1:β-gal at 37 °C from the p40 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal co-transfectants (Fig. 7 B). Furthermore, following temperature stress, the release of p40 Syn-1 was potentiated in the p40 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants (Fig. 7 A, lanes 4 and 5). Consistent with the results observed with the p65 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants, the release of p40 Syn-1 (Fig. 7 A, compare lanes 4 and 5 withlanes 6 and 7) and FGF-1:β-gal (Fig.7 B) from the p40 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal co-transfectants was unaffected by treatment with brefeldin A. In contrast, however, the release of p40 Syn-1 from the p40 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants was not attenuated at 37 °C in the presence of 2-dOG (Fig. 7 C compare lanes 4 and 6), but the potentiation of p40 Syn-1 release and the release of FGF-1:β-gal upon heat shock was inhibited in the presence of 2-dOG (Fig. 7 C compare lanes 5 and 7 and Fig. 7 D compare lanes 4 and 6). These data suggest that the release of p40 Syn-1 may not be regulated by the conditions of temperature stress, rather it may be regulated by the function of a protease whose activity is induced by temperature stress. Syn-1 has been characterized as a constituent of a multiprotein complex involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. Although Syn-1 is thought to be the Ca2+ sensor for neurotransmitter release, Syn-1 Ca2+-independent interactions have been identified, and several of the Syn family members have been reported to function in a Ca2+-independent manner (9Sudhoff T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 22Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson G.W. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Our attempts to increase the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ by treating the cells with the ionophore A23187 did not stimulate the release of either Syn-1 or FGF-1:β-gal in vitro, suggesting that this release mechanism may utilize a component of the Ca2+-independent function of Syn-1. However, we cannot conclude that Ca2+ does not play a role in this non-classical release mechanism, since it is possible that the ionophore was not delivered either at the appropriate time or in the appropriate cellular context, or perhaps it may need additional co-factors to function in this pathway. Moreover, deleting residues 120–214 from Syn-1 blocks the release of both Syn-1 and FGF-1 in response to temperature stress. This region contains the Ca2+-binding site, the phosphatidylserine-binding site, and the casein kinase II phosphorylation site (39Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 42Davktov B. Sontag J.M. Haya Y. Petrenko A.G. Fyske E.M. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6816-6822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus suggests that one of these activities may be required in this release mechanism. Likewise, 2-dOG affects the generation of ATP and thus a number of cellular processes including glycosylation. Whereas the decrease in the temperature stress-induced release of both Syn-1 and FGF-1:βgal in the presence of 2-dOG suggests that ATP may play a role in this pathway, we cannot conclude what is the exact mechanism by which ATP is utilized. Even though the FGF-1 non-classical release pathway is utilizing components of the classical exocytotic pathway, the mechanism of FGF-1 release appears to be novel. It has been proposed that during neurotransmitter release, Syn-1 facilitates the docking of the vesicle at the plasma membrane and then, in an ATP-dependent step, the vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane and subsequently releases the vesicular contents into the extracellular compartment (23Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 63-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have observed the release of the extravesicular (cytoplasmic) domain of Syn-1 (p40) into the medium conditioned by heat shock, and our data suggest that the release of p40 Syn-1 in response to stress occurs by an ER-Golgi-independent mechanism that requires time, energy, transcription, and translation. These features are also conserved within the non-classical FGF-1 release pathway, and the release of both polypeptides requires a 95-amino acid domain contained within the extravesicular portion of Syn-1. The data presented here demonstrate that Syn-1 is required for the release of FGF-1 and, more specifically, that it is the sequences within the extravesicular domain of Syn-1 that are involved in the regulation of this release. Moreover, these data confirm our prior observation that antisense-Syn-1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants are attenuated in their ability to release FGF-1 in response to temperature stress (14Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Garfinkel S. Mouta Carreira C. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22209-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Syn-1 has been demonstrated to bind a large number of proteins and phospholipids, and the majority of these interactions are mediated by the C2 domains in the extravesicular portion of Syn-1 (9Sudhoff T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar,24Sutton R.B. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 25Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although deleting residues 120–214 from Syn-1 results in a dominant-negative mutant Syn-1 that blocks FGF-1:β-gal release, when either p40 Syn-1 or p65 Syn-1 was co-transfected into FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cells, we did not observe an increase in FGF-1:β-gal release in response to temperature stress when compared with singly transfected FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell transfectants. Moreover, p40 Syn-1 was released following transfection into NIH 3T3 cells that do not overexpress FGF-1 or that express the cysteine-free mutant FGF-1 that is not competent to enter the release pathway (Fig. 3). FGF-1:β-gal release may not be increased when either p40 Syn-1 or p65 Syn-1 is overexpressed because, similar to the regulation of the conventional secretion pathway, this non-classical pathway may be a multiprotein complex and another factor(s) may be limiting. The identification of a S100 gene family member as a component of a multiprotein Syn-1 and FGF-1 complex in ovine brain (26Mouta Carreira C. LaVallee T. Tarantini F. Jackson A. Tait-Lathrop J.

LaVallee T. Tarantini F. Jackson A. Tait-Lathrop J. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 240: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and GenBankTM accession number AB001567), support this premise. The observation that p40 Syn-1 release is not dependent on the expression of FGF-1 suggests that Syn-1 or perhaps Syn gene family members may also be involved in the regulation of other proteins that utilize non-classical release pathways, such as FGF-2 and the interleukin (IL)-1 prototypes IL-1α and IL-1β. The p40 Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal NIH 3T3 cell co-transfectants exhibited the constitutive release of p40 Syn-1 at 37 °C. Since treatment with 2-dOG only inhibits the potentiation of p40 Syn-1 release after temperature stress, the 2-dOG data suggest that only a small percentage of the p40 Syn-1 may be able to access the non-classical FGF-1 release pathway (Fig. 7 C). It is also possible that the soluble non-vesicular p40 Syn-1 may be able to enter the regulated non-classical release pathway(s) through protein-protein interactions. This may occur by potential interactions with endogenous p65 Syn-1, since the C2B domain of Syn-1 has been demonstrated to self-associate (28Sugita S. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Chapman E.R. An S. Edwarson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol.

The constitutive release of p40 Syn-1 from p40-transfected NIH 3T3 cells and the regulated release of p40 Syn-1 from p65-transfected NIH 3T3 cells suggests that a protease may be involved in the regulation of the FGF-1 and Syn-1 release pathways. However, the generation of a soluble form of Syn-1 is not the only requirement for release, since the p65-(del 120–214) construct produces a p35 proteolytic fragment that is not competent to enter the stress-induced release pathway. p65 Syn-1 has been characterized to contain a single hypersensitive proteolytic site (between amino acids 111 and 112) in vitro,and cleavage at this site results in the liberation of the extravesicular Syn-1 fragment from vesicles into the soluble fraction (12Perin M.S.

Increasingly, intracellular proteases are proving to play pivotal roles in the regulation of biological systems, such as the cell cycle proteases in the regulation of cell growth (32King R.W.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) expressed a mammalian protein, galectin-1, in yeast and identified three proteins that were involved in the non-classical exocytosis of this protein, suggesting that non-classical secretion pathways may also be evolutionarily conserved. However, FGF-1 and FGF-2 utilize divergent exocytotic pathways, since FGF-2 is not secreted in response to temperature stress (15Shi J. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1142-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and FGF-1 may utilize a nonvesicular exocytotic mechanism, since the soluble p40 extravesicular portion of Syn-1 is secreted with FGF-1. Although we do not know the mechanism that FGF-1 and p40 Syn-1 use for release, both polypeptides bind phosphatidylserine (7Tarantini F. Gamble S. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Deleting a region of the Syn-1 protein that contains the phosphatidylserine-binding site, p65-(del 120–214), blocks the release of both Syn-1 and FGF-1:β-gal and further suggests that phosphatidylserine may play a role in this non-classical release mechanism. Additionally, FGF-1 exhibits molten globule character at 42 °C which may allow FGF-1 to disrupt/interrupt membrane structural integrity (40Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9913-9920Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Whether p40 Syn-1 exhibits a similar feature is not known; however, it had recently been shown that the C2A domain of Syn-1 is able to directly penetrate the lipid bilayer (41Chapman E.R. Davis A.F.

The active site structures are highly conserved between these two classes, allowing atomic alignment of all of the residues ligating the metal ions. In each class, the monomeric metal center is coordinated by three histidines and an aspartic carboxylate donated by the protein and a coordinated solvent defining a conserved catalytic motif for these enzymes. In addition to the metal ligands, a number of other residues are strictly conserved including a glutamic acid residue (Glu170 in E. coli MnSOD sequence numbering (26Steinman H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8708-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) that is part of a distinctive D XWEHXXY sequence motif containing two of the four protein-donated metal ligands (Asp167 and His171). The corresponding glutamates in the two subunits of the homodimer symmetrically span the dimer interface, forming hydrogen bonds with both the peptide NH and the ND1 nitrogen of His171 in the other subunit (Fig.1) contributing to outer sphere interactions of the active site metal ion (18Edwards R.A. Baker H.M. Jameson G.B. Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 161-171Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This double glutamate bridge is preserved in all known Fe- and MnSODs, implying an important role in protein structure. In order to investigate the contribution of the conserved glutamate residue in protein stability and active site reactivity, we have prepared the E170A mutant MnSOD for detailed characterization.MATERIALS AND METHODSE. coli were grown in 2× Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 1% glucose, 125 μg/ml ampicillin, and 150 μm Mn(II) salts. Further additions of ampicillin (150 mg/liter) were made hourly after the optical density reached 0.3 at 600 nm, and a second addition of 1% glucose was made at midlog phase. Fermentations for protein preparation were routinely performed in a 10-liter New Brunswick Scientific BioFlo 3000 Bioreactor. Cultures for protein preparations were grown at 37 °C with vigorous agitation and O2 purging. Superoxide dismutase was purified as described previously (27Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5528-5540Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with an additional chromatofocusing chromatography step using PBE-94 polybuffer exchanger and Polybuffer-74 ampholyte but without CM-52 ion exchange chromatography. Superoxide dismutase activity was measured using the xanthine oxidase/cytochrome c inhibition assay (4McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxidase activity was measured using the o-dianisidine assay (28Huggett A.S.G. Nixon D.A. Biochem. J. 1957; 66: 12PGoogle Scholar) in 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 1 mmH2O2.The pDT1–5 antibiotic resistance plasmid containing the sodA locus (29Touati D. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. Danièle Touati (Institut Jacques Monod, Centre National de la Récherche Scientifique, Université Paris VII). Plasmids were isolated from overnight cultures with Qiagen Midi Kit™ and purified according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Mutagenesis of the pDT1–5 plasmid was performed using the Stratagene QuickChange™ in vitrosite-directed mutagenesis system with 12 cycles of amplification. Products were transformed into Stratagene Epicurian Coli XL-2 Ultracompetent E. coli cells according to the manufacturer's directions, and transformants were selected on LB agar containing 20 mg/liter ampicillin and 80 mg/liter methicillin. A positive clone was selected for expression of the mutant protein and the mutation verified by sequence analysis (Molecular Biology Core Facility, Oregon Regional Primate Research Center, Beaverton, OR). E. coli sodA− mutant strain QC781 (30Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University. Competent E. coli QC781 sodA− cells were prepared according to standard procedures (31Hanahan D. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning Methods. 1. IRL Press, Ltd., London1985: 109-135Google Scholar). The mutant plasmid pDT1–5(E170A) was transformed into competent E. coli QC781 sodA− cells for protein expression. Comparative growth studies were performed on E. coli K-12sodA + (Stratagene E. coli Epurican Coli® XL) and sodA − (E. coli QC781) strains transformed with wt or mutant plasmids. Cells were grown on LB broth, pH 7.5, containing 125 μg/ml ampicillin with vigorous agitation in culture flasks. Growth of the cultures was monitored turbidometrically at 600 nm. Cultures were supplemented with an additional 125 μg/ml ampicillin when the culture reached A600 = 0.6.Protein concentration was routinely determined by optical absorption measurements, using the previously reported molar extinction coefficient (ε280 = 8.66 × 104m−1 cm−1) (32Beyer Jr., W.F. Reynolds J.A. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4403-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Metal quantitation was performed by atomic absorption spectrometric analysis using a Varian SpectrAA 20B atomic absorption spectrometer equipped with a GTA-96 graphite furnace for high sensitivity analytical determinations. The Mn(III) form of the purified enzyme was prepared by molybdicyanide oxidation (27Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5528-5540Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Optical absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary5 UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrometer interfaced with a PC for data acquisition. CD spectra were recorded on an AVIV Associates model 14DS UV-vis-NIR spectropolarimeter as described previously (27Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5528-5540Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded on a Varian E-109 X-band EPR spectrometer equipped with an Air Products He cryostat. Molecular weight determination was made by size exclusion chromatography using a BioGel P-100 (Bio-Rad) column (1.5 × 98 cm) developed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The column was calibrated by chromatographing molecular mass standards (blue dextran, 200 kDa; E. coli wt MnSOD, 46 kDa; bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; horse heart cytochrome c, 12.4 kDa) (2 mg in each protein sample) and the molecular mass of the eluted fractions for E170A MnSOD were estimated by evaluating the effective distribution coefficient Kav = (Ve −V0)/(Vt −V0), where V0 is the elution volume for blue dextran, Ve is the elution volume for the protein sample, and Vt is the total column volume. Metal replacement was accomplished by partial denaturation of E170A Fe2-MnSOD in 3.5 mguanidinium HCl in the presence of 10 mm EDTA (pH 3.5) and renaturation by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 1 mm MnCl2 (33Ose D.E. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34Vance C.K. Miller A.-F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 461-467Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONFe- and Mn-containing superoxide dismutases are closely related proteins with similarities both at the level of amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure. Among more than 60 FeSOD and MnSOD sequences that are now known, only 12 amino acid residues are absolutely conserved, including the four metal-binding residues (His26, His81, His171, Asp167) and eight other residues (Leu7, Leu14, Pro16, Tyr34, Trp128, Trp169, Glu170, and Tyr174) (41Hunter T. Ikeburo K. Bannister W.H. Bannister J.V. Hunter G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4925-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Among these, Glu170 and Tyr174 are found at the dimer interface and serve to link the two subunits together like interlocking fingers. The strictly conserved Glu170 of one monomer is hydrogen-bonded to the manganese ligand His171 of the other monomer (Fig. 1) (18Edwards R.A. Baker H.M. Jameson G.B. Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 161-171Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Both of the carboxylate oxygens are engaged in hydrogen bonds, one to the peptide NH of His171 and the other to the ND pyrrole-type nitrogen of His171. The two-fold symmetry of the dimer reproduces these interactions in the other subunit and total of four hydrogen bonds are thus associated with the Glu170double bridge. Another conserved residue, Tyr174, also spans the dimer interface and interacts with the ND of His30 in the gateway to the active site.The origin of metal specificity in the (Fe,Mn)SODs has been an outstanding question that is made all the more perplexing by the close structural similarities between the homologous Fe and Mn proteins. Despite these structure and sequence similarities, catalytic activity appears to be strictly determined by the metal content. With the exception of certain cambialistic SODs that exhibit activity with either metal ion, Fe- and MnSODs lose activity when the metal that occurs in the native enzyme is replaced (in vitro or in vivo) by the other. Although there is evidence that the protein is not absolutely selective in metal binding, the metal that confers activity generally is the one that is preferentially bound. This indicates that there are in fact two distinct structural questions, one relating to metal binding selectivity and another to metal-specific reactivity. E. coli MnSOD metal binding selectivity depends on the cultivation conditions (36Beyer Jr., W.F. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 303-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8923-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the protein will bind either metal provided as a supplement to the growth medium, although only Mn is active at physiological pH.

Chem. 1996; 1: 532-541Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with either Fe or Mn bound show remarkable conservation of active site structure and thus have not clearly resolved these questions of metal selectivity. Mutagenesis experiments appear to be most promising, although the results have not been predictable. For example, mutation of a single nonligating residue (Tyr34) relaxes metal specificity in E. coliMnSOD without significantly affecting metal binding selectivity, and Y34F Fe2-MnSOD exhibits approximately 30% wt FeSOD activity (39Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8923-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Overall, it appears likely that metal binding selectivity and reactivity are a consequence of subtle differences in the metal environment.The E170A MnSOD mutant that we have prepared modifies a critical residue at the dimer interface contributing outer sphere interactions to the metal binding site. Even though the mutant protein spectroscopically resembles the wild type protein, in other respects it is very different. In particular, subunit interactions are obviously perturbed by this mutation. The observation of both monomer and dimer forms in the elution profile in size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2) indicates that the loss of four hydrogen bonds in the E170A mutant severely compromises the stability of the homodimer. In constrast to wt MnSOD, which requires 4–6 m guanidinium chloride to dissociate to monomers (43Werber M.M. Greenstein L.A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1991; 12–13: 335-348Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the relatively fragile E170A dimer (D) dissociates into monomer (M) species under mild conditions (neutral pH buffers, low ionic strength).2M⇄DREACTION 2 Interconversion between monomer and dimer forms is demonstrated by the appearance of dimeric protein when purified monomer is concentrated and rechromatographed (Fig. 3). The mutant dimer elutes with a slightly larger distribution coefficient (Kav) than observed for the wt MnSOD (Fig. 2), possibly indicating a more compact organization of the mutant protein.The mutation also results in a striking change in metal binding selectivity. Purified E170A MnSOD contains only iron, even though expressed in cells supplemented with manganese salts. However, reconstitution with mangananese leads to formation of a complex spectroscopically indistinguishable from wt Mn2-MnSOD, demonstrating that the protein retains its ability to bind that metal ion. The mutant protein thus preferentially binds iron instead of manganese, a reversal in metal binding selectivity that appears to be a consequence of the altered outer sphere interactions associated with Glu170-His171 hydrogen bonding. Loss of this hydrogen bond is expected to make the histidine ligand less basic, stabilizing the iron complex. Native iron and manganese derivatives of the E170A protein exhibit optical absorption, CD, and EPR spectra nearly identical those observed for the corresponding complexes of wild type protein (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7), reflecting similar metal environments. Anion interactions perturb the optical absorption and CD spectra for E170A Fe2-MnSOD (Fig. 4) and the spectra for the anion complexes (with N3− and F−) are nearly identical to those reported for authentic FeSOD (35Slykehouse T.O. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5472-5477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These complexes also titrate with affinities similar to those reported for authentic FeSOD anion complexes (35Slykehouse T.O. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5472-5477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EPR spectroscopy is particularly sensitive to subtle changes in metal environment for protein complexes. Low temperature EPR spectra of the native E170A Fe2-MnSOD is typical of low symmetry high spin Fe(III), closely resembling the spectrum of authentic FeSOD under similar conditions (Fig. 7). The inverted zero-field splitting (D < 0) required by the relative intensities of the low field features (g = 9–10) is also observed for the authentic FeSOD and is consistent with a distorted trigonal geometry for the metal complex (40Griffith J.S. Theory of Transition-Metal Ions. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1964Google Scholar). EPR spectra indicate that the Fe derivative is converted by anions to new complexes near the rhombic limit of electronic symmetry, as previously found for both authentic FeSOD and Fe2-MnSOD. Coordination chemistry of the Fe center is thus quite similar in both the mutant and wild type proteins. The pH titration of E170A Fe2-MnSOD (Fig. 5) indicates that hydrolysis of the Fe(III) occurs near pH 8.6, approaching authentic FeSOD behavior (p Ka = 9) (44Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 1981; 21: 54-58Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and nearly two pH units higher than found for wt Fe2-MnSOD (pKa = 6.7) (37Yamakura F. Matsumoto T. Kobayashi K. Asada K. Yoshikawa T.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8923-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Optical absorption and CD spectra of the E170A Mn2-MnSOD (Fig. 6) are also very similar to the corresponding spectra for wt MnSOD (27Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5528-5540Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, this complex has altered coordination chemistry, and the optical spectra give no indication of azide binding to 100 mmNaN3. Low temperature EPR spectra for E170A Mn2-MnSOD also closely resemble the wt enzyme (27Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5528-5540Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar), indicating that the essential features of the Mn binding site are preserved in the mutant protein.Surprisingly, despite the near identity of spectra with wt complexes, neither Fe or Mn derivatives of the E170A protein exhibit detectable superoxide dismutase activity under standard assay conditions. For E170A Mn2-MnSOD, the lack of catalytic activity correlates with the lack of anion interactions and may reflect an obstruction of the substrate funnel in the mutant. However, the lack of enzymatic activity is more puzzling for E170A Fe2-MnSOD, which closely resembles authentic FeSOD in anion affinities and hydrolytic stability. Access to the active site metal center is evidently unimpaired in this complex, and the absence of catalytic activity may be a consequence of dissociation of the dimeric structures at the low protein concentrations required for superoxide dismutation assay. Dissociation of the dimer would eliminate the second bridge (Tyr174) that appears to be important for orienting His30 in the substrate funnel (Fig. 1), accounting for inactivation of the enzyme on dilution. The higher protein concentrations used for spectroscopic studies, on the other hand, would tend to favor the dimeric structure.We have also investigated whether the loss of superoxide dismutation activity is associated with the appearance of new catalytic function in the mutant protein. For Cu,Zn-SOD, a number of mutations lead to enhanced peroxidase activity (47Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Roe J.A. Lee M.K. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E.

Biophys. 1997; 346: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using the standardo-anisidine peroxidase assay, we find essentially identical levels of activity between Fe2-MnSOD and the E170A mutant. The activity of the mutant enzyme decayed rapidly suggesting oxidative damage to active site residues, whereas the activity of Fe2-MnSOD was more persistent and did not appear to be susceptible to this type of damage. Neither specific activity is greater than 10−4 of horseradish peroxidase activity.Lack of SOD activity for the E170A mutant makes it ineffective in complementation of sodA − mutant E. coli lacking the chromosomal gene for MnSOD (Fig. 8, bottom). Because they lack an essential antioxidant function, sodA− E. coli expressing E170A MnSOD (from the pDT1–5(E170A) expression plasmid) are expected to exhibit impaired growth when compared with the same cells expressing functional MnSOD from wt pDT1–5 or pDT1–5(Y34F) plasmids (30Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 46Farr S.B. D'Ari R. Touati D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8268-8272Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, the effect of E170A MnSOD expression on growth of sodA −host cells is even more severe than that associated with expression of a nonfunctional D167N MnSOD mutant which retains the dimeric organization but is unable to bind metals. In the sodA+genetic background, the differences between functional (wt, Y34F) and nonfunctional (D167N) mutants is decreased, while the E170A mutant is still significantly impaired. This demonstrates that in this partial diploid construction, impaired growth is a dominant phenotype of the E170A mutation, implying gain of a new toxic function rather than simply loss of catalytic function. This toxic function might represent a new oxidative reactivity (contributing to increased oxidative stress) or biochemical complications resulting from nonspecific association with other proteins and membranes at the exposed hydrophobic patch of the dissociated dimer, leading to interference with essential metabolic functions. There is no evidence for new oxidative reaction of E170A MnSOD, and a deleterious effect of dimer dissociation appears more likely. Proteins are very sensitive to mutation at the subunit interfaces, which will tend to destabilize oligomeric structures. In this regard, E170A MnSOD is of interest relating to the identification of Cu,ZnSOD mutants as a genetic lesion associated with hereditary amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a lethal neurodegenerative disease (49Deng H.-X. Hentati A. Tainer J. Iqbal Z. Cayabyab A. Hung W.-Y. Getzoff E.D. Hu P. Herzfeldt B. Roos R. Warner C. Deng G. Soriano E. Smyth C. Parge H.E. Ahmed A. Roses A.D. Hallewell R.A.

Many of these mutants map to the dimer interface of the homodimeric Cu,ZnSOD protein, and it has been suggested that defective interprotein interactions may be involved in the neurodegenerative disorder (49Deng H.-X.

https://openalex.org/W2154940003,"Stimulation of pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells with the mitogen epidermal growth factor (EGF) produced a rapid and robust accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), an accumulation which, in other systems, has been shown to be essential for mitogenesis. Brief pretreatment of the cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) suppressed the EGF-mediated ROS increase. EGF failed to produce elevations in ROS in a PC12 variant stably expressing a dominant-negative p21ras construct (PC12-N17) or in cells pretreated with the MEK inhibitor PD098059.

These results suggest a novel mechanism for the rapid interruption of mitogenic signaling by the neurotrophin NGF. The neurotrophins are a family of polypeptides that are involved in the survival and differentiation of several different classes of neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although some aspects of the intracellular mechanisms by which they act are now clear (1Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 2Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), the way in which they produce global changes in phenotype, such as differentiation or survival, is not known. One general effect of the neurotrophins on neurons is to inhibit cell division. The mechanisms by which this occurs are a matter of substantial research interest because they may have relevance to the overall control of cell division. It was recently reported that one of the early requirements for the promotion of cell division by mitogenic growth factors involves a rapid intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesNGFnerve growth factorEGFepidermal growth factorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumDCHF-DAdichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetatel-NAMEl-nitroarginine methyl esterNDGAnordihydroguaiaretic acidNBTnitro blue tetrazoliumSNPsodium nitroprussidePDGFplatelet-derived growth factor.1The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesNGFnerve growth factorEGFepidermal growth factorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumDCHF-DAdichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetatel-NAMEl-nitroarginine methyl esterNDGAnordihydroguaiaretic acidNBTnitro blue tetrazoliumSNPsodium nitroprussidePDGFplatelet-derived growth factor. such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide (3Sundaresan M.

In related experiments exogenously added ROS stimulated mitogenesis in various cell types and was associated with increased expression of cellular markers of proliferation (5Guyton K.Z. Liu Y.

Neurotrophin-stimulated production of reactive nitrogen species, such as nitric oxide, is reportedly required for neurotrophin-induced cytostasis and differentiation (6Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 374: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Together these reports suggest that the signal transduction mechanisms leading to either mitogenesis or differentiation may be controlled by the relative balance between distinct forms of oxidant and nitroxide levels within cells. reactive oxygen species nerve growth factor epidermal growth factor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate l-nitroarginine methyl ester nordihydroguaiaretic acid nitro blue tetrazolium sodium nitroprusside platelet-derived growth factor. reactive oxygen species nerve growth factor epidermal growth factor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate l-nitroarginine methyl ester nordihydroguaiaretic acid nitro blue tetrazolium sodium nitroprusside platelet-derived growth factor. The PC12 cell model (7Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar, 8Dichter M.A. Tischler A.S. Greene L.A. Nature. 1977; 268: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) has been quite informative in providing an understanding of neurotrophin-induced signal transduction. PC12 cells stimulated with the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) undergo many of the global changes in phenotype exhibited by normal neurons, including a cessation of cell division. PC12 cells are unique in that they contain functional receptors for the mitogen epidermal growth factor (EGF), as well as for NGF (9Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). One way in which the neurotrophins promote cellular differentiation may be to interfere with mitogenic signals. Indeed, previous data from this laboratory suggest that one action of NGF on PC12 cells is the long term down-regulation of mitogen receptors (9Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 10Lazarovici P. Oshima M. Shavit D. Shibutani M. Jiang H. Monshipouri M. Fink D. Movsesyan V. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11026-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The present experiments demonstrate that NGF also has profound and immediate effects on mitogen signaling. The data show that treatment of PC12 cells with NGF suppresses the increase in ROS produced by the mitogen EGF. Both the increase in ROS produced by EGF and the decrease in ROS produced by NGF appear to be dependent on an intact Ras signal transduction pathway. The generation of ROS produced by EGF is blocked by an inhibitor of lipoxygenase, and the decrease produced by NGF is blocked by an inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthetase. Furthermore, a nitric oxide donor mimicked NGF suppression of ROS. Overall, these data elucidate a mechanism for the acute action of the neurotrophins in blocking signal transduction from mitogen receptors. PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 7% fetal bovine serum, 7% horse serum, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 100 units of penicillin/ml. nnr5 and nnr5 variants were grown in RPMI containing the same additives. One day before each experiment cells were seeded onto collagen-coated 35-mm dishes at a density of 500,000 cells per well in DMEM plus serum, streptomycin, and penicillin as above and allowed to equilibrate overnight. Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCHF-DA; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was dissolved in ethanol and diluted with calcium-free Krebs-Ringer buffer to a final concentration of 5 μm. Cells were loaded with DCHF-DA in Ringer's solution for 5 min, and then the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM. The fluorescence of intracellular dichlorofluorescein was quantitated by confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy (Leica TCS4D, Leica Lasertechnik Heidelberg, Germany) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 520 nm, respectively. Images were collected using a 512 × 512 pixel format and archived for later analysis. The intensity of the fluorescence in single cells was quantified using Leica quantitation software. For each treatment, three different fields were recorded. The relative fluorescence intensity was measured in 10 cells per field (total: 30 cells per dish) and expressed on a 0- to 255-step gray scale of intensity of fluorescence emission. Two dishes were evaluated in each experiment. EGF and NGF (Collaborative Bioproducts, Boston, MA) were diluted in DMEM and added to cultures at final concentrations of 100 ng/ml each. Sodium nitroprusside and nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) were dissolved in sterile H2O. l-NAME (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol. Diphenyliodonium chloride (Calbiochem), allopurinol (Sigma), PD098095 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone; Calbiochem), and NDGA (Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO. All inhibitors were added to cells 30 min before EGF stimulation. NGF was added either 5 or 10 min before EGF. Treatment of PC12 cells with EGF produced a rapid and robust increase in ROS in the cells (Fig. 1,A and B). Treatment with NGF had no comparable effect (Fig. 1 C), however pretreatment of cells for 10 min with NGF completely abolished the increase in ROS seen upon subsequent treatment with EGF (Fig. 1 E). The EGF-induced increase in ROS appears to require signaling through the Ras pathway. PD098059, a MEK inhibitor, blocked the EGF-induced increase in ROS (Fig. 2 a, A–C) Ras dominant-negative cells (PC12-N17) treated with EGF did not show any increase in ROS (Fig. 2 a,D and E), although, clearly, these cells have EGF receptors (11Shibutani M. Lazarovici P. Johnson A.C. Katagiri Y. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6878-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The NGF-induced decrease in mitogen-generated ROS also appears to depend on the Ras pathway. PC12 nnr5 cells (12Green S.H. Rydel R.E. Connolly J.L. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 830-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), which lack p140trk receptors for NGF, respond normally to EGF (Fig.2 b, A and B) but are not affected by pretreatment with NGF (Fig. 2 b, C). When p140trk receptors are heterologously expressed in nnr5 cells, the ability of NGF to prevent the EGF-induced rise in ROS is restored (Fig. 2 b, D and E). However PC12 nnr5 cells transfected with a mutant p140trk , which lacks binding sites for PLCγ and for Shc (13Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 791-805Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (471) Google Scholar), and thus do not show NGF-induced activation of the Ras pathway, did not show a suppressive effect of NGF on EGF-induced ROS formation (Fig. 2 b, F and G). The dual reliance of EGF-induced ROS generation and NGF-induced ROS suppression on the Ras pathway is probably predictable; mitogen-induced ROS generation in fibroblasts is suppressed by the expression of dominant-negative isoforms of Ras (14Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar), and the suppression of endogenous ROS by NGF in GT1-1 trk cells is dependent on the Ras pathway (15Dugan L.L. Creedon D.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Holtzman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4086-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is likely that the species of ROS generated by EGF stimulation is superoxide (O2−). Among a number of drugs that are known to inhibit superoxide-producing enzymes, including NADPH oxidase, cyclooxygenase, and lipoxygenase, only pretreatment of cells with the lipoxygenase inhibitor NDGA suppressed EGF-induced ROS production (Fig.3 a, A–D). In addition, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), a specific chemical scavenger of superoxide, suppressed EGF-induced ROS accumulation (Fig. 3 a, E and F). It is also likely that the quenching by NGF pretreatment of the superoxide generated is a result of the production of nitric oxide. Only an inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthetase, l-NAME, prevented the action of NGF (Fig. 3 b, A–F). In addition, the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) mimicked the suppressive action of NGF on ROS generation by EGF (Fig.3 b, G and H). It has been shown that nitric oxide will react with superoxide in a highly favorable reaction to produce peroxynitrate anion (OONO−) (16Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which appears to react readily with reduced glutathione (17Quijano C. Alvarez B. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It is also known that nitric oxide donor compounds inhibit lipoxygenase activity (18Maccarrone M. Corasaniti M.T. Guerrieri P. Nistico G. Agro A.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The data show that EGF treatment of PC12 cells produces a marked increase in ROS, that is likely superoxide, and that NGF produces little or none, despite the data indicating that NGF is initially mitogenic for PC12 cells (19Burstein D.E. Greene L.A. Dev. Biol. 1982; 94: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with NGF abolishes that increase in a manner dependent upon p140trk . Further, both these actions rely on the integrity of the Ras signal transduction pathway. Finally, the inhibitory action of NGF treatment on ROS accumulation appears to involve the generation of nitric oxide and either the reaction of that nitric oxide with superoxide or the inhibition, by nitric oxide, of lipoxygenase. The acute nature of the response to NGF predicts either a very quick increase in inducible nitric-oxide synthetase or a rapid NGF-induced activation of the constitutive nitric-oxide synthetase, an effect not hitherto reported. It is known that treatment of PC12 cells with NGF leads to a rapid down-regulation of the EGF receptor (20Brown A.B. Carpenter G. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21Mothe I. Ballotti R. Tartare S. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1983; 4: 737-746Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that this is the reason for the prevention of the ROS increase by NGF because the down-regulation is only partial and a comparable action of NGF is seen when 3T3 cells transfected with p140trk are treated with PDGF (data not shown), and there is no reason to believe that NGF has any effect on the levels of PDGF receptors in these cells. There is some evidence for the involvement of Ras in ROS generation. In A431 cells, overexpression of Ras was associated with a 40-fold induction in the promoter activity of human 12-lipoxygenase (22Chen B. Liu Y. Yamamoto S. Chang W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid metabolites produced by lipoxygenase have been reported to be Ras-dependent mitogens for certain cells (23Ralasca M. Silletta M. Carvelli A. Di Francesco A. Fusco A. Ramakrishna V. Corda D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2113-2124PubMed Google Scholar) and may also influence Ras-dependent proliferation by modulating its associations with GTPase-activating proteins (24Yu C. Tsai M. Stacey D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6683-6689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tsai M. Yu C. Wei F. Stacey D. Science. 1989; 243: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). There is only a limited amount of information regarding the involvement of Ras in the regulation of nitric oxide production; lipopolysaccharide induction of nitric-oxide synthetase in astrocytes can be prevented with specific Ras inhibitors (26Pahan K. Sheikh F. Khan M. Namboodiri A. Singh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2591-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The generation of ROS is an essential element in signaling from mitogen receptors (3Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2311) Google Scholar, 4Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). If increases in ROS are prevented the cells neither proliferate nor express normal markers of PDGF-induced mitogenic signaling. Treatment of appropriate cells with neurotrophins inhibits their cell division. The present data indicate that this effect of the neurotrophins is, at least in part, due to their ability to generate nitric oxide which, in turn, quenches the ROS generated by mitogen treatment and thus interrupts the signal transduction pathway that leads to cell division."

Generally associated with membranes, striatin is mostly found in dendritic spines where it is likely to play a role in Ca2+-signaling events. In this paper, we characterize its calmodulin-binding properties. By using deletion mapping and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the sequence located between amino acids 149 and 166 as the main calmodulin-binding site. The predicted corresponding peptide is potentially able to form a basic amphiphilic helix, as is often the case for many known calmodulin-binding sites. Calmodulin binding to striatin is Ca2+-dependent, with half-maximal binding occurring around 0.5 μm free Ca2+. In the presence of Ca2+, the equilibrium dissociation constant of calmodulin/striatin fusion protein complex is 40 ± 5 nm. We also show that brain striatin subcellular localization, as studied by tissue fractionation, is Ca2+-dependent, this effect being probably mediated by calmodulin.

Striatin is a quantitatively minor, Ca2+/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM 1The abbreviations used are: CaMcalmodulinbCaMbiotinylated CaMGSTglutathioneS-transferase.)-binding protein of Mr 86,225, mostly expressed in neurons of the motor and olfactory structures of the central nervous system (1Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J.

Cloning of the human homologous gene revealed that it is a highly conserved protein (96% identity, 98% similarity) (35Moqrich A. Mattei M.G. Bartoli M. Rakitina T. Baillat G. Monneron A. Castets F. Genomics. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of the protein sequence consists in a series of 8 WD repeats. WD repeats are found in a number of transducing proteins, the prototype of which is the β-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, and in proteins assisting in the assembly of multiprotein complexes (2Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). In synaptosomal preparations, striatin behaves as a membrane-associated protein, although its peptide sequence does not display hydrophobic stretches able to account for transmembrane domains nor signatures for myristoylation or farnesylation. calmodulin biotinylated CaM glutathioneS-transferase. Striatin is exclusively expressed in the somatodendritic compartment of neurons, at the exclusion of axons. It is mostly found in dendritic spines, which are the postsynaptic compartments of excitatory synapses. Spines are tiny protrusions that stud the surface of dendrites (3Harris K.M. Kater S.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 341-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). They are dynamic structures, their number and location varying with the ongoing neuronal activity (4Patel S.N. Stewart M.G. Brain Res. 1988; 449: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Segal M. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 468-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Ca2+ plays a major role in these structures, which are considered to be independent subcellular Ca2+ compartments (5Segal M. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 468-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Denk W. Yuste R. Svoboda K. Tank D.W. Curr. Opin.

They contain glutamateN-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors, which are major Ca2+ ionophores (8Yamazaki M. Mori H. Araki K. Mori K.J. Mishina M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, they also contain large amounts of CaM (9Grab D.J. Berzins K. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8690-8696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CaM-binding proteins, principally Ca2+/CaM kinase type II and, in significant amounts, calcineurin, adenylyl cyclases, and cAMP phosphodiesterases (reviewed in Refs. 3Harris K.M. Kater S.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 341-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar and 10Kennedy M.B. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 264-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), as well as cytoskeletal proteins (myosin, fodrin 1, α-actinin) (11Glenney Jr., J.R. Glenney P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Wyszynski M. Lin J. Rao A. Nigh E. Beggs A.H. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Nature. 1997; 385: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Striatin, a component of spines, has molecular features suggesting that it, too, is involved in Ca2+ signaling events. We have shown previously that striatin directly interacts with CaM in the presence of Ca2+ (1Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, we mapped the CaM-binding site of striatin and determined its affinity for CaM. We also show that Ca2+, most probably through its interaction with CaM, induces a partial subcellular redistribution of striatin. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that striatin is an adapter or transducer protein involved in Ca2+/CaM-dependent events within dendritic spines. Plasmids used to produce fragments of striatin fused to the C terminus of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) were constructed using the pGEX-KT expression vector (13Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). First, plasmid pGEX-NcoI, with the new unique restriction sites NcoI, NdeI, andKpnI, was constructed by inserting an oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCATGGGACATATGGGTACCG-3′) and its complementary strand (5′-AATTCGGTACCCATATGTCCCATG-3′) between the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pGEX-KT. The 1.95-kilobase pairNcoI-EcoRI fragment encompassing codons 1–650 of striatin (obtained from plasmid pFCC, see Ref. 1Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was inserted between the corresponding sites of pGEX-NcoI, yielding pGEX-striatin 1–650. Plasmid pGEX-striatin 1–427, which codes GST fused to the first 427 residues of striatin, was constructed from pGEX-striatin 1–650: the plasmid was digested by StuI andEcoRI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of the four dNTPs, and ligated (the EcoRI site is restored upon ligation). Plasmid pGEX-striatin 1–98, which codes GST fused to the first 98 residues of striatin, was constructed similarly by deleting the BglII-EcoRI fragment of pGEX-striatin 1–650. To produce a fusion protein encoding the whole striatin sequence, theNcoI to BamHI striatin fragment obtained from pFCC (in which a BamHI site immediately follows the STOP codon) was inserted into the NcoI- andBglII-digested plasmid pGEX-striatin 1–427. The resulting plasmid, called pGEX-striatin 1–780, codes GST fused for the entire striatin coding sequence (Fig. 1). The plasmids were transformed into the Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue strain. 200-ml cultures of bacterial cells were grown until 0.3A600 was reached. 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added, and incubation went on for 12 h at 18 °C. Cells collected by centrifugation were resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl chloride). Cells were frozen at −70 °C, thawed, and disrupted in a French press. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g, at 4 °C for 15 min. The 4-ml supernatant was mixed with 2 ml of a 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B slurry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with lysis buffer and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged 5 min at 500 × g and the unbound proteins discarded. The resin was washed twice with 20 ml of lysis buffer. Fusion proteins bound to the matrix were eluted with 3 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. To modify the first putative CaM-binding site of striatin 1–427, plasmid pGEX-striatin 1–427 was digested by BglII and ligated with the oligonucleotide GATCCG, resulting in the insertion of the dipeptide Pro-Asp between Asp-97 and Leu-98, in the middle of the putative CaM-binding site 1: 88 RKGQENKKDPDLVRRIKML 107. The resulting protein is called striatin 1–427 mut 1. To modify the second putative CaM-binding site of striatin 1–427, a modified recombinant polymerase chain reaction was used for mutagenesis (14Ansaldi M. Lepelletier M. Mejean V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 110-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, the primers 5′CAGCAGAACAGCCAGTTCATGG*GGAAGCC*AGGCC 3′ and 5′ATGAACTGGCTGTTCTGCTGTGGCTGCACCTCCG 3′ were designed for recombinant polymerase chain reaction. The complementary regions are underlined. In these primers, striatin Trp-155 was changed to Gly and Gln-158 was changed to Pro (the corresponding codons are indicated by an asterisk). The resulting sequence reads: 149 QNSQFMGKPGRQLLRQYL 166. The obtained plasmid, pGEX-striatin 1–427 mut 2, contains a thirdBglI site (GCC*AGGCCGGC), allowing to check for the expected mutations. To introduce this mutation in the whole fusion protein, we constructed plasmid pGEX-striatin 1–780 mut 2 by inserting the XbaI fragment of pGEX-striatin 1–780 in theXbaI-linearized pGEX-striatin 1–427 mut 2. The protein expressed by this plasmid is called GST-striatin 1–780 mut 2. All constructs were verified by sequencing. CaM was biotinylated using the immunoprobeTM biotinylation kit from Sigma. Purified fusion proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide (7.5%) gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 2% non-fat dry milk in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h. The nitrocellulose sheets were then incubated in TBS buffer containing 1% dry milk and 50 nm biotinylated CaM (bCaM), for 12 h at 4 °C (a 1% milk solution is about 3 mm Ca2+). After three 5-min washes in the same buffer, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:5000 dilution of ExtrAvidin-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) in the same buffer. After three washes, the blots were revealed by the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate chromogenic system. The same procedure was achieved in the presence of 5 mm EGTA. E. coli extracts were prepared in lysis buffer containing 2 mm Ca2+. Each lysate was incubated with 100 μl of CaM-Sepharose 4B slurry for 1 h at 4 °C. The resins were washed with 1 ml of the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 5 mm EGTA. Aliquots of the lysates, unretained fractions, and eluates were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (7.5 and 9%) and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Western blots were revealed using a rabbit serum directed against a fusion protein containing the 50 first amino acids of striatin (serum 75) and the ECL procedure (Pierce). To determine the dissociation constants (KD) values of the complexes composed of the various striatins 1–427 and Ca2+/CaM, we used an adaptation of the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method described by Friguet et al. (15Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar), which allows to determine true equilibrium constants in solution. Biotinylated CaM, at a constant concentration, is incubated in solution with various amounts of a given ligand (GST-striatin in the present case) until the equilibrium is reached. The amount of free bCaM in the liquid phase is then monitored by an indirect binding assay, in which the liquid phase is transferred for a short period of time (15 min) into a microtitration plate coated with the catalytic domain ofBordetella pertussis adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase binds CaM with high affinity (KD 0.1 nm) (16Ladant D. Glaser P. Ullmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2244-2250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). bCaM bound to the plate is detected by addition of ExtrAvidin-peroxidase conjugate. To ensure the validity of the procedure, two conditions must be fulfilled (discussed in detail in Ref. 15Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). One is that the peroxidase activity measured is proportional to the amount of free bCaM in the liquid phase. We checked that it was indeed the case within the range of 0.03–4 nm bCaM. The other is that no readjustment of the equilibrium in the liquid phase occurs during the incubation in the adenylyl cyclase-coated wells. This is achieved by minimizing the incubation time. We checked that during a 15-min incubation time, less than 10% of total free bCaM bound the adenylyl cyclase-coated wells. Practically, bCaM (1 nm) was incubated with various concentrations (0–200 nm) of wild type or mutated GST-striatins 1–427 in buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor) containing either 100 μm CaCl2 (buffer B-CaCl2) or 1 mm EGTA (buffer B-EGTA) for 15 h at room temperature. The mixtures were then transferred to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates coated with 5 μg/ml recombinant adenylyl cyclase solution (purified as in Ref. 16Ladant D. Glaser P. Ullmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2244-2250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and saturated with 10 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor. After 15-min incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed three times with the corresponding buffer. A 1:1000 dilution of ExtrAvidin-peroxidase (Sigma) was added to the wells and incubated 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, the adenylyl cyclase-bound bCaM was revealed by the o-phenylenediamine chromogenic system (Sigma) and the absorbance read on a Bio-Rad microplate reader model 550. The fraction of free bCaM in each sample is given by the ratio of absorbance measured for this sample to the absorbance measured in samples containing only bCaM. In these experiments, we checked that sequential 15-min incubations of the same mixture in different adenylyl cyclase-coated wells did not decrease the amount of the measured free bCaM by more than 10%. Ca2+/EGTA buffers containing 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.20, at 20 °C, 0.1% trypsin inhibitor, and various free Ca2+ concentrations: 50, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.1 μm were prepared according to Tsien and Pozzan (17Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), using the fluorescent dye indicator fura-2 (Molecular Probes) and a Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorimeter. To set Ca2+concentrations above 10 μm, known amounts of total Ca2+ were added. The Ca2+ dependence of the interaction of CaM with either brain cytosol striatin (see below) or striatin 1–427 was determined by using the procedure described by Warret al. (18Warr C.G. Kelly L.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 5 μg of striatin 1–427 or 400 μg of brain cytosol proteins, in buffer containing ≥50 μm free Ca2+, were incubated with 50 μl of CaM-Sepharose slurry for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound protein was removed by extensive washing in the same buffer. The resin was incubated, for 10 min at 4 °C, twice with 1 ml of the same buffer and then step by step with Ca2+/EGTA buffers of decreasing Ca2+concentration, ending with buffer containing no Ca2+ and 2 mm EGTA. The proteins eluted after incubation with each Ca2+/EGTA buffer were bound onto nitrocellulose by using a Schleicher and Schuell slot blotter Minifold. Striatin was revealed by Western blotting using an anti-striatin serum (see above) and ECL detection. Precise quantification of striatin was achieved by densitometric analysis of the immunoreactive bands, using a specially designed software (Biocom analysis system). The brains of 2-week-old rats were homogenized, in the minute following decapitation, using a glass-Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer, in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, inhibitors of proteases (as in Ref. 1Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and either 1 mm EGTA (EGTA buffer) or 100 μm Ca2+ (Ca2+ buffer). The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g, at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatants, referred to as EGTA-cytosol or as Ca2+-cytosol, were saved. The pellets were solubilized as described (1Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.9% Lubrol-PX (Lubrol/protein ratio of 2.5) and either 1 mmEGTA or 100 μm Ca2+ and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The EGTA- and Ca2+-Lubrol-soluble protein fractions were saved and the pellets resuspended by homogenization in the corresponding Lubrol buffers. Protein was determined according to Schaffner and Weissmann (19Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). The various fractions were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide (7.5%) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were stained with Ponceau red, striatin was revealed by the ECL procedure, and the Western blots were scanned. The same experiments were repeated four times with the same results. In a previous study, we showed that recombinant striatin expressed inE. coli bound CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner (1Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To localize the CaM-binding site(s), we produced in E. coli various fragments of striatin and determined their CaM-binding capabilities. To facilitate their purification, the various fragments were genetically fused to glutathione S-transferase. A schematic representation of the different constructs is shown in Fig.1. The fusion proteins were produced inE. coli at a low growth temperature. In these conditions, the recombinant proteins were found in the soluble bacterial extracts and could be purified by a single chromatographic step on glutathione beads. Fig. 2 A shows a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified preparations. The CaM binding properties of the various proteins were tested by a CaM-overlay procedure, in which the proteins were separated on SDS gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with bCaM. Fig.2 B indicates that bCaM bound in a Ca2+-dependent manner GST-striatin 1–427 (lane 1) and GST-striatin 1–780 (lane 5) but not GST-striatin 1–98 (lane 4). In a different set of experiments, the various GST-striatin fusion proteins were tested for their ability to bind CaM-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 3, GST-striatin 1–780 (box A) and GST-striatin 1–427 (box B) bound CaM-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+ and were eluted in the presence of EGTA. GST-striatin 1–98 (box F) did not bind CaM-Sepharose, whether in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Altogether, these results suggest that the main CaM-binding site(s) is (are) located in the central region of striatin, between residues 98 and 427.Figure 3Binding of various GST-striatins to CaM-Sepharose. Lysates from E. coli expressing various GST-striatin fusion proteins were analyzed by CaM-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Each box corresponds to one given GST-striatin fusion protein: box A, GST-striatin 1–780; box B, GST-striatin 1–427; box C, GST-striatin 1–427 mut 1; box D, GST-striatin 1–780 mut 2; box E, GST-striatin 1–427 mut 2; box F, GST-striatin 1–98. Identical volumes of lysate, unretained fraction, and EGTA-eluted fraction (eluate) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, using an antistriatin serum (number 75) and the ECL procedure. The Western blot shown in each box corresponds, from left to right, to striatin contained in the lysate, the unretained fraction, and the eluate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Many of the characterized CaM-binding sites consist in a basic amphiphilic helical peptide (20O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Examination of the amino acid sequence of striatin reveals the presence of two such potential basic amphiphilic helices located from residues 88 to 105 (site 1) and residues 149–166 (site 2). To determine whether one of these two regions is indeed involved in CaM binding, each site was modified so as to disrupt its potential ability to bind CaM. For site 1, the dipeptide Pro-Asp was inserted between Asp-97 and Leu-98, yielding GST-striatin 1–427 mut 1. This insertion was expected to both decrease the ability of this segment to form an α-helical structure and to abolish its amphipathicity. Two residues of site 2, Trp-155 and Gln-158, were substituted, respectively, by Gly and Pro, these substitutions being expected to both decrease the propensity of this segment to form an α-helical structure and to decrease the hydrophobic interactions involved in CaM binding. These substitutions were introduced in both GST-striatin 1–427 and GST-striatin 1–780. The CaM-binding properties of the two modified proteins were analyzed by the CaM-overlay technique. As shown in Fig. 2 B (lanes 3 and6), GST-striatin mut 2 did not bind bCaM in the presence of Ca2+, whereas GST-striatin 1–427 mut 1 (lane 2) bound bCaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner, just as did the wild-type GST-striatins. Binding assays on CaM-Sepharose confirmed that GST-striatin mut 1 (box C) bound CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner, whereas both GST-striatins mut 2 (boxes D and E) had lost the property to bind Ca2+/CaM. Since GST-striatin 1–780 mut 2 is unable to bind CaM in the presence of Ca2+, the peptide sequence 149–166 represents the main CaM-binding site of striatin. The dissociation constants (KD) of striatin 1–427 wild-type and striatins 1–427 mut 1 and mut 2 for CaM were measured by a microtitration assay, which allows the determination of the true affinity constant of a given complex in solution (see “Experimental Procedures”). By this method, the KD measured for the GST-striatin 1–427·CaM complex in the presence of Ca2+ was 40 ± 5 nm (Fig. 4 A). The affinity of striatin 1–427 mut 1 for bCaM in the presence of Ca2+ was identical to that of wild-type striatin (Fig.4 B), whereas that of striatin 1–427 mut 2 was drastically reduced, if not abolished (Fig. 4 C). The Ca2+ dependence of the interactions of CaM with both GST-striatin 1–427 and cytosol brain striatin were determined. Both proteins bound CaM-Sepharose in the presence of 50 μm of Ca2+. The Ca2+ concentrations at which both brain cytosol striatin and striatin 1–427 dissociated from CaM-Sepharose occurred at a similar Ca2+ concentration, around 0.5 μm (Fig. 5). In a number of cell types, certain sets of proteins are known to translocate from one subcellular compartment to another, often as a function of changes in distribution and concentration of second messengers. We tested whether the pattern of striatin distribution within brain subcellular fractions could be modified as a function of Ca2+/CaM concentration. Subcellular fractionation of rat brain homogenates was achieved in the presence or absence of Ca2+, yielding cytosol proteins, Lubrol-soluble proteins, and Lubrol-insoluble proteins (described under “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 6 A). Whether the homogenization was performed in the presence of EGTA or of Ca2+, the cytosols contained 25 ± 5% of the total protein, the Lubrol-soluble proteins 58 ± 5%, and the Lubrol-insoluble pellets 17 ± 3%. The relative amount of striatin in each fraction was assessed by scanning of Western blots (Fig. 6 B). When the homogenate was prepared in the presence of 1 mm EGTA, striatin was present in highest amount in the Lubrol-soluble fraction (Fig. 6 C, lane 2), but was also found in the cytosol fraction (lane 3) and in the Lubrol-insoluble fraction (lane 1). When the homogenate was made in the presence of 100 μm Ca2+(lanes 4–6), the Lubrol-insoluble fraction did not contain any striatin (lane 6). Densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms showed that in the latter case, the striatin content of the cytosol was almost twice that measured in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 6 C). The same experiments were repeated four times with the same results. Striatin has been the first member of the WD-repeat family of proteins known to interact with the ubiquitous calcium sensor protein, CaM (1Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The WD repeats have been identified in numerous signaling proteins, and it has been suggested that this motif is involved in their multiple interactions with target proteins, within a regulatory network. The function of striatin is currently unknown, but its ability to interact with CaM as well as the presence of WD repeats in its sequence suggest that this protein is involved in Ca2+-dependent signaling at the postsynaptic membrane level. Recently, the β-subunit of transducin, a heterotrimeric G protein, and the prototype of the WD-repeat family, was also shown by Liu and colleagues to directly bind Ca2+/CaM (21Liu M. Yu B. Nakanishi O. Wieland T. Simon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18801-18807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The authors suggest that Ca2+/CaM-binding to Gβ differentially modulates the interaction of Gβ with its multiple effectors. We hypothesize that CaM binding to striatin could similarly affect its interaction with its targets. The CaM-binding domain of striatin, called domain or site 2, has been defined in this study by directed mutagenesis and expression of fusion proteins. It includes residues 149–166 and conforms to the frequently encountered CaM-binding motif consisting in a basic amphiphilic helix. In the CaM-binding peptide of myosin light chain kinase, which typifies this motif, two aromatic residues, separated by 12 amino acids, are responsible for anchoring the peptide to the N- and C-terminal halves of CaM, respectively (22Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). In the case of striatin, it is likely that the aromatic residues Phe-153 and Tyr-165, separated by 11 amino acids, also anchor striatin to the N- and C-terminal halves of CaM. Some proteins have two or multiple CaM-binding domains, for example the Trpl ion channels (18Warr C.G. Kelly L.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the α1-syntrophin (23Newbell B.J. Anderson J.T. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a CaM-stimulated phosphodiesterase (24Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Kwak K.S. Huang J. Charbonneau H. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30989-31000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the NR1 subunit ofN-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (25Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The possibility that striatin possesses two CaM-binding domains appears unlikely since the GST-whole length striatin fusion protein no longer binds CaM when domain 2 is mutated. This mutation was designed in such a way as to decrease the ability of this region to form an α-helix and to prevent the hydrophobic interactions involved in CaM binding. In the case of the β-subunit of transducin, Liu and colleagues (21Liu M. Yu B. Nakanishi O. Wieland T. Simon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18801-18807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) determined that the CaM binding corresponded to residues 40–63. Interestingly, residues 53–63 belong to the first WD repeat of the seven such repeats that constitute most of the protein. The CaM-binding domain of the β-subunit of transducin is therefore part of the propeller-like structure revealed by crystallography (26Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Ifiiguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 27Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In striatin, on the contrary, the CaM-binding domain is away from the WD-repeat domain. Striatin, a quantitatively minor, membrane-associated protein, is predominantly found in the dendritic spines of a few subsets of neurons (1Castets F. Bartoli M. Barnier J.V. Baillat G. Salin P. Moqrich A. Bourgeois J.P. Denizot F. Rougon G. Calothy G. Monneron A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1051-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ concentration requirement for CaM binding of the many postsynaptic CaM-binding proteins is variable, reflecting the fact that the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ within dendritic spines varies in a highly dynamic way (6Denk W. Yuste R. Svoboda K. Tank D.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Here we show that the affinity of the brain striatin·CaM complex for Ca2+is 0.1–0.5 μm. Hence striatin reversibly binds Ca2+/CaM, depending upon the fluctuations of Ca2+ concentration in spines. We measured theKD value of the complex made up of a GST-striatin fusion protein and of Ca2+/CaM. This KDis of the order of 40 nm, it falls in the same range as that measured for syntrophins (20–100 nm) (23Newbell B.J. Anderson J.T. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and one of the two CaM-binding sites of theN-methyl-d-aspartic acid glutamate receptors (R1 subunit) (73 nm) (25Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). It has been shown in some types of neurons that, following elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and the ensuing binding of CaM to its targets, a certain percentage of CaM and of CaM-binding proteins is redistributed from membrane to cytosol and vice versa (28Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 29Gnegy M.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 32: 45-70Crossref Google Scholar, 30Strack S. Choi S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26354-26359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The translocating proteins would thereby cycle between various states of conformation and/or activity. Although the reality of these phenomena is beyond doubt, estimates of the percentage of translocated proteins under such circumstances are not quite reliable (29Gnegy M.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 32: 45-70Crossref Google Scholar, 32Suzuki T. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 436-437Google Scholar). In this study, we compared brain striatin subcellular localization in tissue extracts realized either in the presence or absence of Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+, striatin was present in all subfractions, including the Lubrol-insoluble fraction, containing postsynaptic densities (10Kennedy M.B. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 264-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and cytoskeletal elements. In the presence of 100 μm Ca2+, on the contrary, striatin was no longer present in this fraction. Such an in vitro differential distribution of striatin is likely to be mediated by CaM, since striatin is not known to directly bind Ca2+. It is tempting to imagine that in vivo a shift in striatin distribution would also occur as a result of Ca2+ fluctuations. Such a study could perhaps be attempted, using immunocytochemistry at the electron microscope level, on NT2 fully differentiated neurons, theoretically able to establish synapses (Stratagene). However, at the stage at which synapses are said to occur, we found that the cells were aggregated, the neurites completely entangled, and no conclusion could be drawn. The expression of striatin in only a few well defined subsets of neurons renders the elucidation of the physiological role of striatin a difficult task. Techniques aiming at decreasing its expression in neuronal cells are currently being used. Future research can now take advantage of the possibility to study neurons expressing high levels of striatin whose CaM-binding site has been disrupted. Indeed, the regulation by Ca2+/CaM of the function of striatin will have to be appreciated, since this protein is expressed in structures in which neurodegenerative processes might well be related to Ca2+-dependent excitotoxicity (33Lipton S.A. Rosenberg P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Claude Klee for extremely valuable critical reading of the manuscript.

Co-expression of full-length pp120, but not its phosphorylation-defective isoforms, increased receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis and degradation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. We, herein, examined whether internalization of pp120 is required to mediate its effect on insulin endocytosis. The amount of full-length pp120 expressed at the cell surface membrane, as measured by biotin labeling, markedly decreased in response to insulin only when insulin receptors were co-expressed. In contrast, when phosphorylation-defective pp120 mutants were co-expressed, the amount of pp120 expressed at the cell surface did not decrease in response to insulin. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis revealed that upon insulin treatment of cells co-expressing insulin receptors, full-length, but not truncated, pp120 co-localized with α-adaptin in the adaptor protein complex that anchors endocytosed proteins to clathrin-coated pits. This suggests that full-length pp120 is part of a complex of proteins required for receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis and that formation of this complex is regulated by insulin-induced pp120 phosphorylation by the receptor tyrosine kinase.

Insulin binding to the extracellular α-subunits of its receptor triggers activation of the tyrosine kinase in the intracellular domain of the β-subunits.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies in NIH 3T3 mouse skin fibroblasts revealed that full-length pp120 is constitutively phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent serine kinase on Ser503 and that this phosphorylation is required for its phosphorylation on Tyr488 residue by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (2Najjar S.M.

Binding of insulin to its receptor triggers the entry of the insulin-receptor complex into clathrin-coated pits, which pinch off the surface membrane to form clathrin-coated vesicles (3Carpentier J.-L. Paccaud J.P. Backer J.M. Gilbert A. Orci L. Kahn C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The clathrin coat is formed upon receptor activation by the sequestration of the cytoplasmic adaptor proteins 2 (AP2) to the inner surface of the membrane where they bind to the clathrin tripods (4Rapoport I. Miyazaki M. Boll W. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Shoelson S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Vesicular trafficking delivers the insulin-receptor complex to endosomes where it undergoes dissociation in the acidic environment. Insulin is then targeted for degradation, whereas the receptor recycles back to the cell surface (5Gorden P. Carpentier J.-L. Freychet P. LeCam A. Orci L. Science. 1978; 200: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Yamada K. Carpentier J.L. Cheatham B. Goncalves E. Shoelson S.E. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3115-3122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Insulin-induced internalization and recycling of the receptor is believed to regulate sensitivity of the cell to insulin (7Carpentier J.-L. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and to constitute the basic mechanism of insulin clearance from the blood, an event that mainly occurs in the liver under normal physiological conditions. The molecular mechanism for insulin endocytosis is not well defined. Insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation is involved in this internalization process (8Hari J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15341-15344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14828-14835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, requirement for substrate phosphorylation is disputed (3Carpentier J.-L. Paccaud J.P. Backer J.M. Gilbert A. Orci L. Kahn C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Smith R.M. Seely B. Shah N. Olefsky J.M. Jarett L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17522-17530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase did not regulate insulin endocytosis in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (3Carpentier J.-L. Paccaud J.P. Backer J.M. Gilbert A. Orci L. Kahn C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibiting pp120 expression in H4-II-E hepatoma cells by antisense mRNA transfection was associated with a decrease in the internalization rate of the insulin-receptor complex (11Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern-Buell C.L. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis and degradation were 2–3-fold higher in NIH 3T3 cells co-expressing full-length pp120 than in cells expressing insulin receptors alone. More recently, we have reported that full-length pp120 stimulated insulin endocytosis via high affinity (receptor-A) rather than low affinity (receptor-B) insulin receptors, despite being equally phosphorylated by both isoforms (12Li Calzi S. Choice V.C. Najjar S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E801-E806PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that pp120-induced increase in insulin endocytosis and degradation does not depend on its phosphorylation state. However, elimination of phosphorylation sites in the truncated splice variant, and alteration of these sites by site-directed mutagenesis, abolished the effect of pp120 on insulin endocytosis and degradation (11Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern-Buell C.L. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that pp120 phosphorylation is required but not sufficient to mediate its effect on receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis and degradation. Because the amino acid sequences in proximity to Tyr488(Tyr-Ser-Val-Leu) and Tyr513 (Tyr-Ser-Val-Val) in tight β-turns share high homology with tyrosine-centered motifs known to interact with AP2 molecules that anchor endocytosed proteins to the clathrin coat of vesicles (13Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 14Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that full-length pp120 exerts its effect by targeting the receptor into clathrin-coated pits. To evaluate this hypothesis, we carried out these initial studies examining whether pp120 internalization is required to mediate its effect on insulin endocytosis. To this end, we used NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing either pp120 alone or with insulin receptors. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis revealed that pp120 did not significantly internalize in the absence of insulin. Biotin labeling of plasma membrane proteins revealed that full-length pp120 underwent endocytosis in response to insulin in cells co-expressing insulin receptors. In contrast, phosphorylation-defective isoforms of pp120 failed to endocytose in response to insulin. Because full-length, but not phosphorylation-defective, pp120 isoforms increased the rate of receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis and degradation (11Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern-Buell C.L. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), our data suggest that internalization of pp120 requires its phosphorylation by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in response to insulin. In vitro GST binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments in intact cells revealed that pp120 did not directly bind to the insulin receptor. Instead, it may be indirectly associated with the receptor via other cellular proteins. Thus, it appears that pp120 exerts its effect on endocytosis by participating in a complex of proteins required for insulin receptor endocytosis.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9341-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the cDNA fragment (nucleotide 1354–1574) encoding the majority of the cytoplasmic tail of wild-type pp120 (aa 452–519) was amplified in a polymerase chain reaction reaction using the wild-type recombinant cDNA (in the pGEM-4Z vector) as template and oligonucleotides s-1354 (tcctaaggatccACTGGCGGGGGAAGT-1368) and α-1574 (acaggaattcCAGGACAGACAATGTTAC-1557) as sense and antisense primers, respectively. The sense oligonucleotide contained a BamHI and the antisense primer an EcoRI restriction site (shown in lowercase letters) to allow for in-frame subcloning of the cDNA product into the GST gene fusion vector (pGEX-1λT, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Similarly, the 68-aa peptides carrying mutations at either Tyr488 or Tyr513 residues were synthesized, using pGEM4Z/pp120 mutant cDNAs as templates (Y488F, Y513F) (see above), and the wild-type oligomers containing BamHI (nucleotide 1354–1368) and EcoRI (nucleotide 1557–1574) as sense and antisense primers, respectively (2Najjar S.M. Philippe N. Suzuki Y. Ignacio G.A. Formisano P. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9341-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CompetentEscherichia coli HB101 cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) were transformed with the GST fusion pGEX-1λT vectors, and the resulting GST peptides were allowed to bind at 4 °C for at least 90 min to 50% reduced glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in the presence of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm dithiothreitol as described previously (2Najjar S.M. Philippe N. Suzuki Y. Ignacio G.A. Formisano P. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9341-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Per manufacturer's instructions, the β-insulin receptor kinase (10 units) was initially autophosphorylated for 5 min at room temperature in the presence of 50 μm ATP, 75 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 70 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). Equal aliquots of the insulin receptor reaction or of buffer alone were added to 2 μg of Sepharose-coupled GST containing fragments from wild-type and mutant (Y488F and Y513F) pp120, and the phosphorylation reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding phosphatase inhibitors on ice. Following mixing for 90 min at 4 °C, the Sepharose pellet was washed in HNTG buffer (150 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Glycoproteins derived from NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing human insulin receptors-A were partially purified by wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography as described previously (2Najjar S.M. Philippe N. Suzuki Y. Ignacio G.A. Formisano P. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9341-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the partially purified fractions (5 μg) was then allowed to bind to insulin (100 nm) or to buffer alone for 30 min at room temperature prior to being assayed for its ability to phosphorylate GST fusion peptides (2 μg) containing fragments of wild-type pp120. The phosphorylation reaction was carried out for 10 min at room temperature in the presence of 25 μm ATP, 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm MgCl2 and MnCl2, 1 mm CTP in 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6. The reaction was terminated on ice by adding phosphatase inhibitors (2Najjar S.M. Philippe N. Suzuki Y. Ignacio G.A. Formisano P. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9341-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation reaction was then allowed to mix for 90 min at 4 °C prior to washing the Sepharose pellet with HNTG buffer (see above) and electrophoresis through 10% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, proteins were detected by autoradiography and immunoblotted with a polyclonal antibody against the intracellular domain of pp120 as described previously (2Najjar S.M. Philippe N. Suzuki Y. Ignacio G.A. Formisano P. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9341-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In some experiments, proteins were immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosines per manufacturer's instructions. To investigate the effect of insulin on surface expression of pp120, transfected NIH 3T3 cells were stimulated with insulin prior to biotin labeling and Pronase digestion. Following lysis, proteins were immunoprecipitated with pp120/HA4 antibody, electrophoresed, and immunoblotted with HRP-labeled streptavidin. The difference in the amount of biotin-labeled pp120 before and after insulin treatment was calculated as percent biotin-labeled pp120 in the absence of insulin and used as measure for the amount of pp120 internalized in response to insulin (Fig.1 B, graph). As revealed in Fig. 1 A, insulin treatment did not decrease the amount of biotin-labeled pp120 (full-length (FL) or truncated (Δ448)) in cells expressing pp120 alone (lane 3 versus lane 1). However, when insulin receptors were co-expressed with human insulin receptors-A (hIR), the amount of biotin incorporated in the extracellular domain of full-length pp120 was substantially decreased by 62.2 ± 3.8% in response to insulin (Fig. 1 B, FL pp120/hIR,lane 3 versus lane 1). Similarly, the amount of biotin-labeled pp120 was decreased by 50.6 ± 9.1% in response to insulin when the phosphorylatable Y513F pp120 isoform was co-expressed (Fig. 1 B, Y513F pp120/hIR,lane 3 versus lane 1). In contrast, the amount of biotin-labeled pp120 was not significantly decreased in cells co-transfected with phosphorylation-defective pp120 isoforms (Fig. 1 B, lane 3 versus lane 1, truncated (Δ448): 11.1 ± 3.4%, and site-directed mutants: Y488F (15.5 ± 8.4%), Y488F/Y513F (−13.2 ± 1.3%), S503A (−36.8 ± 4.5%)]. Instead, most of the phosphorylation-defective pp120 remained at the surface membrane, as evidenced by the comparable decrease in the amount of biotin-labeled pp120 after the removal of the extracellular domains with Pronase (Fig.1 B, lane 2 versus lane 1and lane 4 versus lane 3). Because the effect of pp120 on insulin endocytosis was only detected in cells co-expressing the phosphorylatable (full-length and Y513F) isoforms of pp120 (11Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern-Buell C.L. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), these data suggest that pp120 exerted its effect on receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis by co-internalizing with the insulin receptor and that this required insulin-induced pp120 phosphorylation by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. In fact, expression of the insulin receptor at the cell surface was also decreased in response to insulin in cells co-expressing full-length pp120 as detected by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody against the 130-kDa α-subunit of the insulin receptor (data not shown). To investigate whether pp120 undergoes constitutive endocytosis in the absence of insulin, we examined its co-localization with α-adaptin in cells expressing pp120 alone or with insulin receptors. To this end, we employed indirect immunofluorescence in which pp120 was detected by a polyclonal antibody against its extracellular domain followed by red CyTM3 labeling (Fig. 2,A, C, E, G, I, and K red), and α-adaptin was detected by a monoclonal antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate labeling (Fig. 2, B, D, F, H,J, and L green). Absence of red or green stain of cells when primary antibodies were omitted indicated the absence of nonspecific binding of antibodies against pp120 and α-adaptin to these cells (data not shown). The punctate distribution of label inA revealed that in the absence of insulin, full-length (FL) pp120 was largely distributed on the surface membrane of cells expressing pp120 alone (FL pp120). In fact, pp120 distribution in these cells did not match the typical cytoplasmic distribution of α-adaptin (16Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) as shown in B. Insulin treatment did not noticeably alter this distribution (C andD), suggesting that full-length pp120 did not undergo significant constitutive endocytosis when expressed alone. When full-length pp120 was co-transfected with insulin receptors (FL pp120/hIR), pp120 and α-adaptin remained largely separated in the absence of insulin (E and F). However, when these cells were treated with insulin, most of pp120 co-localized with α-adaptin (G and H). This suggests that pp120 underwent insulin-stimulated endocytosis in cells co-expressing insulin receptors. In contrast, truncated (Δ448) pp120 did not co-localize with α-adaptin when cells co-expressing insulin receptors (Δ448 pp120/hIR) were treated with either buffer alone (I and J) or with insulin (K andL), indicating that truncated pp120 did not undergo insulin-stimulated internalization. Because pp120 phosphorylation by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase appears to regulate its effect on receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis (11Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern-Buell C.L. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we examined whether pp120 is a direct substrate of the insulin receptor kinase. To this end, we examined phosphorylation of a Sepharose-coupled GST-pp120 fusion peptide from the entire C-terminal tail of wild-type, Y488F, and Y513F pp120 mutants by a baculovirus-purified insulin receptor kinase. The β-insulin receptor kinase was initially autophosphorylated (Fig.3, lane 10) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP prior to being allowed to phosphorylate GST-pp120 fusion peptides (Fig. 3, lanes 4, 6, and8) or Sepharose-coupled GST proteins alone lacking pp120 sequences (Fig. 3, lane 2). In control experiments, the β-insulin receptor kinase was omitted from the phosphorylation mixture (Fig. 3, odd-numbered lanes). Phosphatase inhibitors were then added, and the mixture was kept at 4 °C to allow binding between proteins to occur. At the end of the incubation period, proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 3). GST peptide lacking sequences from pp120 did not serve as a substrate for phosphorylation by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (lane 2 versus lane 1). In contrast, the activated insulin receptor caused phosphorylation of a Mr∼32,000 species that corresponds to the GST-pp120 fusion wild-type peptide (lane 4 versus lane 3), indicating that pp120 is a direct substrate of the insulin receptor and that its extracellular domain is not required for its cytoplasmic domain to undergo phosphorylation by the insulin receptor. Moreover, mutating Tyr488 to nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine (Y488F) abolished phosphorylation of GST-pp120 fusion peptide by the tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor (lane 6 versus lane 5). In contrast, replacing Tyr513 with phenylalanine (Y513F) did not alter phosphorylation of GST-pp120 by the receptor (lane 8 versus lane 7), supporting our previous finding that Tyr488 is the main phosphorylation site of pp120 by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (2Najjar S.M. Philippe N. Suzuki Y. Ignacio G.A. Formisano P. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9341-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no band corresponding to the β-subunit of the insulin receptor (Mr ∼48,000) was detected with the GST-pp120 pellet (lanes 3–8). Consistent with these findings, we have observed in collaboration with T. A. Gustafson that the intracellular domain of pp120 did not bind to that of the insulin receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown). Thus, it appears that the intracellular domain of pp120 did not directly bind to the intracellular domain of the insulin receptor in these twoin vitro systems. It remains possible that insulin binding to the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor induces conformational changes that would lead to a direct association between the intracellular domains of pp120 and the insulin receptor. To examine this hypothesis, we treated NIH 3T3 cells co-expressing recombinant human insulin receptors-A and full-length pp120 with either buffer alone (Fig. 4,odd-numbered lanes) or with 10−7minsulin (Fig. 4, even-numbered lanes) prior to subcellular fractionation. Following lysis of the membrane fraction, proteins were immunoprecipitated with either HA4/pp120 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4,lanes 1 and 2, α-pp120) or with a polyclonal antibody against the α-subunit of the insulin receptor (Fig. 4,lanes 3 and 4, α-IR), and the immunopellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the insulin receptor antibody (Fig. 4, all lanes). In addition to theMr ∼190,000 band that corresponds to the insulin receptor precursor, and the Mr ∼90,000 band that was nonspecific, as evidenced by immunoprecipitation with normal rabbit globulin (data not shown), a Mr∼135,000 band corresponding to the α-subunit of the insulin receptor was detected in the immunopellets of the insulin receptor antibody (Fig. 4, lanes 3–4). However, when the pp120 antibody immunopellets were probed with the α-subunit of the insulin receptor, this Mr ∼135,000 band was not detected (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, when the immunoblot was probed with a polyclonal antibody against pp120, theMr ∼120,000 band that corresponds to pp120 was not detected in the insulin receptor immunopellet (data not shown). Thus, the insulin receptor and pp120 failed to co-immunoprecipitatein vivo under our experimental conditions. It remains possible that pp120 associates with the insulin receptor via other proteins. To test this hypothesis, we employed the same phosphorylation/GST binding experiment described above using partially purified insulin receptors derived from NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing human insulin receptors-A. Because we have shown that partially purified insulin receptors could phosphorylate purified pp120 fusion peptides in the presence of 10−7m insulin (2Najjar S.M. Philippe N. Suzuki Y. Ignacio G.A. Formisano P. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9341-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we allowed insulin to initially bind to partially purified insulin receptors prior to introducing either Sepharose-coupled GST fusion wild-type pp120 peptides (WT pp120) or GST proteins lacking fusion peptides (Control) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Under these conditions, the GST protein lacking sequences from pp120 did not undergo phosphorylation by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase nor did it allow detection of any binding protein (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and4). However, when the GST-pp120 fusion wild-type peptide was used, insulin led to a 10-fold increase in the phosphorylation of aMr ∼95,000 protein (Fig. 5 A,lane 2 versus lane 1) that corresponds to the β-subunit of the insulin receptor, as evidenced by immunoblotting with Ab-53 antireceptor antibody (Fig. 5D, α-IR). Additionally, insulin led to a 5-fold increase in the phosphorylation of a Mr ∼32,000 species that corresponds to the pp120 fusion wild-type peptide (Fig.5 A, GST-WT pp120, lane 2 versus lane 1). Interestingly, phosphorylated insulin receptors co-precipitated with Sepharose-coupled GST-pp120 fusion peptide in the presence of insulin under these conditions (Fig.5 A, lane 2 versus lane 1). Moreover, insulin led to a significant increase in the co-precipitation of several proteins of Mr ∼160,000, ∼135,000, ∼68,000, and ∼58,000 (p160, p135, p68, p58). As evidenced by immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine antibody (α-pTyr) (Fig. 5 C), p68 and p58, in addition to the β-subunit of the insulin receptor and three other proteins (Mr ∼80,000, ∼72,000, and ∼40,000), underwent a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of insulin. Because the baculovirus-purified cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor did not co-precipitate with GST-pp120 fusion peptide under similar conditions (Fig. 4), it is reasonable to predict that co-precipitation of partially purified insulin receptors with pp120 in experiments shown in Fig. 5 may have been mediated by these unidentified proteins. These studies constitute the first evidence for an indirect association between pp120 with the insulin receptor. We then examined the effect of mutating tyrosine residues in pp120 (Tyr488 and Tyr513) to nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine (Phe) on the complex formation with the insulin receptor using the same GST fusion binding assay described above (Fig.6). Mutating Tyr488 to Phe abolished insulin-stimulated pp120 phosphorylation and its association with the receptor, as evidenced by the failure to detect the β-subunit of the insulin receptor with the GST-Y488F pp120 fusion peptide (lane 2). In contrast, mutating Tyr513to Phe did not alter the phosphorylation state of pp120 (lane 4 versus lane 6). Similarly to wild-type, the β-subunit of the insulin receptor was associated with the Y513F pp120 fusion peptide (βIR, lane 4 versus lane 6). Interestingly, the p58 and p68 proteins persisted in the Phe513 fusion pellet but were virtually undetectable with the Phe488 complex. This suggests that tyrosine-phosphorylated p58 and p68 may mediate the indirect association between the insulin receptor and pp120 at Tyr488. In these experiments, the higher molecular mass proteins (p135 and p160) did not separate on the 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. Nonetheless, they persist in the fusion pellet independently of the phosphorylation state of pp120, suggesting that they may not be significant components of the internalization complex. We have reported previously that co-expression of full-length, not truncated, pp120 in NIH 3T3 cells increased receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis and degradation compared with cells expressing insulin receptors alone (11Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern-Buell C.L. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Li Calzi S. Choice V.C. Najjar S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E801-E806PubMed Google Scholar). In the current studies, we observed that pp120 regulated receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis by taking part in a complex of proteins required for insulin endocytosis. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis revealed that a large portion of pp120 did not undergo constitutive endocytosis in the absence of insulin. However, in response to insulin, pp120 was endocytosed in cells co-expressing insulin receptors, as evidenced by biotin labeling of plasma membrane proteins. This suggests that insulin did not directly induce endocytosis of pp120. Because insulin binding to its receptor induces receptor internalization, our data suggest that the effect of pp120 on insulin endocytosis was mediated by its effect on the receptor. Moreover, insulin did not induce endocytosis of phosphorylation-defective pp120 isoforms that failed to regulate insulin receptor endocytosis in NIH 3T3 cells (11Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern-Buell C.L. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggests that insulin-stimulated pp120 phosphorylation by the insulin receptor underlied its ability to endocytose as part of a complex of proteins required for insulin endocytosis. In vitro assays (GST binding and the yeast two-hybrid system) and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the intracellular domain of pp120 did not directly bind to that of the insulin receptor. Instead, pp120 appeared to be associated with the insulin receptor via one or more unidentified proteins. We have shown that mutating Tyr488 to nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine altered pp120 endocytosis (11Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern-Buell C.L. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that the reduced effect of pp120 on endocytosis was correlated with decreased association of pp120 with insulin receptor and with at least two other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (p68 and p58). Because one of the main functions of phosphorylated tyrosines in tight β-turns, such as Tyr488and Tyr513 in pp120, is to expose these residues for associations with signaling molecules, it is reasonable to speculate that p58 and p68 play a role in insulin signaling. Mutating Tyr513 did not alter the phosphorylation state of pp120, nor did it modify its effect on insulin-induced receptor endocytosis (2Najjar S.M. Philippe N. Suzuki Y. Ignacio G.A. Formisano P. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9341-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern-Buell C.L. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggests that this residue is not significantly involved in the association between pp120 and other signaling proteins that play a role in insulin endocytosis. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that an association between full-length pp120 and other signaling proteins is mediated by phosphorylated Tyr488 in its intracellular domain. Identification of these proteins would greatly advance our understanding of the basic mechanism of insulin endocytosis. Receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis occurs via two distinct vesicular pathways, clathrin-coated pits and noncoated caveolae (17Goldberg R.I. Smith R.M. Jarett L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When targeted for degradation, insulin is largely internalized through the clathrin-coated pathway (18Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Because insulin is mainly degraded in the liver, its internalization in hepatocytes predominantly occurs through clathrin-coated vesicles. Consistent with these observations, clathrin-coated pits constitute a larger fraction of plasma membrane compartments in hepatocytes than caveolae (18Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Tyr488 and Tyr513 in pp120 are placed in tight β-turns (19Salamov A.A. Solovyev V.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) with flanking amino acid sequences (Tyr488-Ser-Val-Leu; Tyr513-Ser-Val-Val) conforming to the motif that signals sorting of plasma membrane proteins to endosomes via clathrin-coated vesicles (aromatic-Xp-Xp (where Xp indicates any polar amino acid)-aromatic or large hydrophobic amino acid) (13Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 14Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol.

Thus, it is possible that pp120 exerts its effect on insulin endocytosis and degradation by targeting the insulin receptor protein complex to clathrin-coated pits. pp120 is the first substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in insulin receptor endocytosis and degradation (11Formisano P. Najjar S.M. Gross C.N. Philippe N. Oriente F. Kern-Buell C.L. Accili D. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24073-24077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Li Calzi S. Choice V.C. Najjar S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E801-E806PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we have presented evidence that pp120 exerts its up-regulatory effect on receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis by engaging in complex formation with the insulin receptor when phosphorylated in response to insulin. This may direct the complex to the endocytotic vesicles and/or stabilize the insulin-receptor endocytosis complex. In this manner, pp120 would play a substantial role in accelerating insulin uptake and its degradation in the cell. Because pp120 is predominantly expressed in the liver, a major site for insulin degradation, insulin-induced pp120 endocytosis may constitute a basic mechanism for insulin degradation and clearance from the blood.

Earlier studies from our laboratory have led to the identification of a DNA binding protein from mouse brain, named Purα, which interacts with the MB1 regulatory motif of the MBP and stimulates its transcription in glial cells. In this report, we demonstrate that a cellular RNA, with significant homology to 7 SL RNA is associated with Purα. Results from band shift competition studies indicate that Purα-associated RNA (PU-RNA), inhibits the interaction of immunopurified Purα with the MB1 DNA sequence. Results from Northern blot studies indicated that PU-RNA is expressed during various stages of brain development. Of interest, this RNA was found in association with Purα that was produced in the mouse brain at the early stage of brain development. Results from Northwestern analysis using a PU-RNA probe identified the regions within Purα that are important for Purα/PU-RNA association. Production of Purα at the early stage of brain development and its association with PU-RNA at this stage, when Purα exhibits poor binding ability to the MB1 DNA sequence, suggests that PU-RNA may function as a co-factor that negatively regulates Purα interaction with the MBP promoter sequence.

Cell type-specific gene activation is controlled by tissue-specific transcription factors that usually recognize and interact with DNA sequences located within the promoter or enhancer. In some instances, binding of these regulatory proteins to the DNA sequence is facilitated upon self-association of the proteins or their interaction with other members of transcription factors. Such a protein-protein interaction may, in turn, alter the protein conformation and facilitate its binding to the DNA molecules and/or its communication with other transcription factors. The focus of our investigations during the past 10 years has been to decipher the regulatory pathways that participate in cell type-specific gene transcription in the brain.

Macklin W.B. Mol. Neurobiol. 1988; 2: 41-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and its expression is controlled in manners both cell- and stage-specific during brain development (2Kristensson K. Zeller N.K. Dubois-Dalcq M.E. Lazzarini R.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 3Sorg B.A. Smith M.M. Campagnoni A.T. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1146-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 4Verity A.N. Campagnoni A.T. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 21: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In mouse brain, expression of the MBP occurs postnatally such that it is first detected at the end of the first postnatal week, increases dramatically to peak at 18–21 days, and decreases to about 20% of peak levels in mature animals (5Carson J.H. Nielson M.L. Barbarese E. Dev. Biol. 1983; 96: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have indicated that programmed expression of MBP is regulated at the level of transcription (6Shiota C. Ikenaka K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Wiktorowicz M. Roach A. Dev. Neurosci. 1991; 13: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Zeller N.K. Hunkeler M.J. Campagnoni A.T. Sprague J. Lazzarini R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Functional dissection of the MBP regulatory sequence led to the identification of a regulatory motif named MB1, which spans from nucleotide −14 to −50 with respect to the transcription start site. Analysis of nuclear proteins derived from mouse brain identified a 39-kDa protein that forms a nucleoprotein complex with a DNA fragment containing the MB1 sequence (9Lashgari M.S. Devine-Beach K. Haas S. Khalili K. J. Clin. Inv. 1990; 86: 1671-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies indicated that the 39-kDa protein, which is named Purα, recognized the GGC/GGA-rich sequences within MB1 DNA in a single-stranded configuration and has the ability to increase transcription of the MBP promoter both in vitro and in vivo (10Haas S. Gordon J. Khalili K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3103-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Haas S. Thatikunta P. Steplewski A. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Amini S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Of interest, Purα binding activity to the MB1 sequence occurs in a developmental stage-specific manner that coincides with the pattern of MBP transcription (10Haas S. Gordon J. Khalili K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3103-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Evidently, at the early stage of brain development (days 3–7, postnatally), the level of Purα association with MB1 is extremely low, whereas during the phase of myelination (18–20 days) and in adults (day 30), its binding activity to MB1 drastically increases. Preliminary examination of Purα production indicated that although its levels increase between the first and second week of brain development, a significant amount of Purα is detected at the early stage of mouse brain development, which may not account for its extremely low level of association with the MB1 DNA sequence at this stage. These observations imply the participation of a co-factor(s) that may determine Purα binding activity to the DNA molecule. The ability of Purα to interact with a GGN repeat in a single-stranded form prompted us and others (12Herault Y. Chatelain G. Brun G. Michel D. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 85-93PubMed Google Scholar) to examine its binding ability to RNA molecules. Here, we describe our results demonstrating that Purα obtained from brain extract is in association with RNA molecules that have the ability to inhibit its binding activity to the MB1 DNA. Of interest, this RNA, which we have named PU-RNA, has significant homology to the 7 SL RNA, is expressed during various stages of brain development, and is found in association with Purα in 5-day-old mouse brain. Thus, our data suggest that PU-RNA functions as a co-factor by determining the binding activity of Purα to the MBP promoter sequence and indirectly participates in the developmental activation of the MBP promoter in mouse brain. myelin basic protein Purα-associated RNA polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription base pair(s). Nuclear extracts from mouse brains at different stages of development were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (13Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) except that the second wash with buffer A was eliminated. The concentration of protein extract was measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and the extracts were stored at −70 °C. For immunoprecipitation, approximately 100 μg of nuclear extract were incubated with 1 μg of either nonimmune serum or clone 9C12 anti-Purα antibody for 2 h at 4 °C in buffer containing 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The immunocomplex was collected with 50 μl of prewashed Pansorbin, and the pellets were washed three times in the above buffer. Subsequently, the pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and either analyzed by the Western blot technique for detection of Purα or used for extraction of RNA. For RNA extraction, total nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) were extracted from the pellets and the supernatants of the immunoprecipitate using phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The nucleic acid pellets were redissolved in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 30 mm NaCl and treated with RNase-free DNase for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of RNase inhibitor. The reaction mixture was subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. This step was repeated twice to ensure complete removal of the DNA molecules. The RNA samples were stored at −70 °C in 75% ethanol until use. One hundred micrograms of mouse brain nuclear extracts were precipitated using anti-Purα antibody according to the procedure described above with the exception that CaCl2 and MgCl2 were removed from the buffer. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times, and the protein-antibody complexes were eluted in 50 μl of high salt buffer C (13Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) for 1 h at 4 °C. Pansorbin was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min, and the supernatants that contained the eluted protein were collected for use. The eluate was diluted with low salt buffer B (13Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) to a final KCl concentration of 150 mm. For band shift studies, 5 μl of immunopurified protein and 1 μg of total nuclear extract were incubated for 30 min on ice in binding buffer containing 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 30,000 cpm of the 5′-32P-labeled MB1A oligonucleotide DNA (5′-TCAGAGGGCCTGTCTTTGAAGGTG-3′) or MB1A ribonucleotides in the presence or absence of various amounts of DNA and RNA competitors, as indicated in each experiment. PU-RNA competitor was prepared byin vitro transcription using T7 polymerase. For RNase treatment, the protein and/or extracts were incubated with or without RNase for 15 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the labeled probe. All incubations for binding reaction were performed in the presence of 5 μg of bovine serum albumin and 1 μg of poly(dI/dC). The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 6% native polyacrylamide gels (19:1) (Bio-Rad) in 0.5× TBE buffer at constant (150 V) voltage. The RNAs obtained from the immunocomplexes and the supernatant of the immunoprecipitation reactions using 100 μg of nuclear extracts were used as a template for reverse transcription assay. The RNA was denatured in transcription buffer provided by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim) containing the specific BC200-derived downstream primer (5′-AGAGAACGGGGTCTCGC-3′) at 75 °C for 15 min. The primer was then allowed to anneal to the RNA molecules as the reaction was gradually adjusting to 42 °C. AAV Reverse Transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) was used to synthesize the cDNAs. The cDNA synthesis was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h in the presence of the mixture of 0.1 mm dNTP and the RNase inhibitor. The reaction was terminated by heat inactivation of the enzyme at 95 °C for 10 min. For low cycle PCR, one-fifth of the total cDNA was used as a template in the PCR. The amplification reaction was carried out using 10 cycles of PCR with the following cycle parameters: denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and synthesis at 72 °C for 1 min. The RT primer along with the upstream primer (5′-CGTGCCTGTAGTCCCAG-3′) derived from BC200 was used in the PCRs. For cloning of the amplified DNA in the TA vector (Invitrogen), the PCR was performed at 35 cycles, and a 10-min extension at 72 °C was included at the end of the last PCR cycle. The PCR product was cloned into the TA vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Direct sequencing of the PU-RNA cDNA was performed using both upstream and downstream BC200-derived primers. Sequencing was performed by the Sanger methods (14Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moar D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). The Sequenase version kits were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (version 2.0, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The [α-32P]dATP or the [α-35S]dATP labeled DNA fragments were resolved on a 6% denaturing (urea) acrylamide gel (19:1) (Bio-Rad). The data from sequencing reactions were verified in at least five independent experiments. For Southern blot hybridization, the PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel, and the DNAs were transferred onto Hybond membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After cross-linking, the membranes were prehybridized at 65 °C in buffer containing 6× SSC, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After 6 h, the DNA probe that was generated from PU-RNA cDNA using the Redi-prime kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added directly to the prehybridization solution, and hybridization was carried out for 16 h. The membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The membrane was air-dried and exposed overnight to Kodak x-ray film. PU-RNA probe was synthesized using a linearized pCDNA3 vector containing the PU-RNA cDNA as a template and the T7 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). Labeling of the RNA and transcription reaction was carried out by the method provided by the supplier (Boehringer Mannheim), where the newly synthesized PU-RNA was uniformly labeled with [32P]UTP. The RNA probe was treated with RNase-free DNase to remove the template DNA, and the unincorporated isotope was removed by G50 spin columns (Life Technologies, Inc.). The full-length GST fusion Purα and the various Purα deletion mutants were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were transferred to the transblot membrane (Bio-Rad) for 16 h at 4 °C using semidry transfer at a constant current of 125 mA. After transfer, the membrane was treated with binding buffer containing 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. The membrane was incubated for an additional 30 min in binding buffer containing 0.5% nonfat dry milk and 50 μg/ml tRNA. The labeled RNA probe (107 cpm) was added to the binding buffer, and the blot was incubated for 3–5 h at room temperature. All washes (usually 4–6 washes, for approximately 10 min each) were carried out in the presence of 0.5% dry milk and 50 μg/ml tRNA in binding buffer. The membranes were exposed to Kodak x-ray film overnight. Total RNA was extracted from mouse brain at various stages of development by a modified guanidine isothiocyanate method (14Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moar D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Approximately 20 μg of total RNA isolated from mouse brain tissue were analyzed on denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel and hybridized to the PU-RNA cDNA probe after transfer to nitrocellulose as described previously (14Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moar D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Previously, we identified and molecularly cloned a gene whose product, Purα, increased the level of transcription from the MBP promoter both in vitro and in vivo (10Haas S. Gordon J. Khalili K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3103-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Haas S. Thatikunta P. Steplewski A. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Amini S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Purα associates with the MBP regulatory motif, MB1, which is located between nucleotides −14 and −50, with respect to the transcription start site and contains the putative Purα binding site, GGNGGN. Our preliminary observations, along with the results from other laboratories, suggested that Purα has strong binding affinity to single-stranded DNA and associates with RNA molecules (11Haas S. Thatikunta P. Steplewski A. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Amini S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Herault Y. Chatelain G. Brun G. Michel D. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 85-93PubMed Google Scholar). In order to further investigate the association of Purα with RNA and to determine the importance of such an interaction in binding of Purα to the MB1 DNA sequence, mouse brain nuclear extract was treated with anti-Purα antibody, and the ability of the immunopurified Purα to bind to the MB1 DNA probe was examined by band shift assay. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the immunopurified Purα bound to the MB1 DNA probe and formed a complex with electrophoretic mobility similar to that seen upon binding of Purα from the unfractionated nuclear extract and MB1 probe (comparelanes 2 and 3). The protein content of the immunocomplexes obtained by the control serum showed no binding ability to the MB1 probe (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). Fig. 1 A (bottom) illustrates results from Western blot analysis of total brain nuclear extract (lane 1) and the immunopurified Purα protein obtained from brain nuclear extract (lane 3). The band corresponding to the 39-kDa Purα was detected in total nuclear extract, and the immunocomplex was obtained from the extract treated with anti-Purα antibody. To gain some evidence regarding the association of RNA molecules with the immunopurified Purα and to evaluate the effect of such an association on the Purα-MB1 assembly, total ribonucleic acid was extracted from the Purα immunocomplex and was used as a competitor in an MB1-directed band shift assay. As shown in Fig. 1 B, inclusion of 1 ng of PU-RNA in the DNA binding reaction decreased the interaction of immunopurified Purα with the MB1 DNA probe (compare lanes 2 and 3). At a higher concentration (3 ng) of PU-RNA, no signal corresponding to the Purα-MB1 complex was detected (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). The addition of RNase to the binding reaction containing 3 ng of PU-RNA restored the assembly of the Purα-MB1 complex (Fig. 1 B, lane 5), suggesting that the observed inhibitory effect is dispensable and mediated by the RNA molecules. The addition of PU-RNA and RNase to the MB1 DNA alone had no effect on the electrophoretic mobility of the MB1 probe (Fig. 1 B, lane 6). To further examine the specificity of this observation, the competition experiment was repeated with 3 ng of PU-RNA (PU) or an equal amount of RNA obtained from the supernatant of the immunoprecipitate (S). As shown in Fig.1 C, whereas the PU-RNA effectively blocked association of Purα to the MB1 probe, the supernatant RNA did not abrogate the formation of the Purα-MB1 complex. These observations indicate that RNA species are associated with the immunopurified Purα and that the participant RNA molecules have the ability to control DNA binding activity of Purα. The computer-assisted search for RNAs with the Purα binding site led us to suspect that Purα may be associated with the RNAs encompassing Alu core sequences, the GGAGGC repeat (15Britten R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5992-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The 7 S RNAs represent the only known abundant RNA type that contains the Alu-like core repeat sequence (16Quentin Y. Genetica. 1994; 93: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Sharp P.A. Nature. 1983; 301: 471-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Strub K. Moss J. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3949-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Of interest, in neural cells brain-specific RNAs, named BC1 and BC200, represent the transcripts of transcriptionally active Alu genes and contain a high degree of homology to 7 S RNA (19Cheng J.G. Tiedge H. Brosius J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 549-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Lukiw W.J. Handley P. Wong L. Crapper McLachlan D.R. Neurochem. Res. 1992; 17: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Martignetti J.A. Brosius J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11563-11567Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Watson J.B. Sutcliffe J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3324-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In order to examine whether immunopurified Purα is associated with 7 S or BC200 RNAs, we designed oligonucleotides derived from the conserved regions of these transcripts and used them as primers for cDNA priming and PCR amplification in a reaction containing Purα-associated RNA molecules. Under optimum conditions, no DNA fragment corresponding to the expected 95-base pair species indicative of 7 S or BC200 sequences was amplified. However, under similar conditions, an approximately 290-base pair fragment was obtained, indicating that the PCR primers were able to hybridize to the regions further upstream from the designated region and amplify a larger DNA fragment. Fig. 2 illustrates the primary sequence of the central region of the amplified fragment, which exhibits significant homology to 7 SL RNA. Despite the unexpected size of the amplified DNA fragment, an advanced gapped BLASTN search confirmed that the amplified cDNA corresponding to the PU-RNA sequence may belong to the 7 SL family of cellular RNA and has the highest homology score of 613 and a probability event of 4.2e − 78. Fig. 2 illustrates the alignment of PU-RNA to the neuron-specific BC200 (BC) and left arm of 7 SL RNAs (7S), where the primers for RT-PCR were generated and to the 7 SL (SL) RNA with the highest homology score. PU-RNA differs significantly from the BC200 and left arm of 7 SL, which were used to generate primers, as examined by an advanced BLASTN search, which was optimized to find only the nearly identical sequences. The@ symbol depicts the nucleotides that are conserved. As shown in Fig. 2, only two single base substitutions and one single base deletion distinguish PU-RNA from the highest homology human 7 SL sequence. In order to identify putative Purα binding sites positioned in the single-stranded areas of PU-RNA, secondary prediction was determined. PU-RNA shows extensive stem-loop structure with the stability of −69.7 kcal/mol at 25 °C. Through this analysis, we were able to identify at least two putative Purα binding sites (GGN) that are located within the loops of the PU-RNA (data not shown). In a different series of studies, we assessed the fraction of Purα-associated RNA that encompasses sequences with homology to 7 SL RNA. Results from sequencing of 12 clones obtained by RT-PCR of Purα-associated RNAs utilizing random primers revealed that five clones have homology to the Alu repeat, which is common in 7 SL RNAs (data not shown). In the next series of studies, we examined the level of Purα and the associated PU-RNA at various stages of brain development. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the 39-kDa Purα protein was detected by Western blot analysis of the brain protein extracts from mouse at 5, 10, 12, and 45 days after birth (lanes 1–4, respectively) with the notion that its levels increased at day 10 and remained virtually constant thereafter. In parallel, we performed immunoprecipitation of the extract from mouse brain at various ages utilizing anti-Purα antibody, and the RNA molecules were extracted from Purα immunocomplexes and were used in an RT-PCR assay for detection of the 295-bp PU-RNA. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the 295-bp PU-RNA was detected in the Purα immunocomplex derived from 5-day-old mouse brain. In order to examine the level of PU-RNA total RNAs were obtained from mouse brain at various stages of development and examined by Northern blot technique. As shown in Fig.3 C, strong signals indicative of a high level of PU-RNAs were detected at the early, middle, and late stages of mouse brain development (lane 1). The integrity of the RNAs is demonstrated in Fig. 3 D, where the levels of 28 and 18 S RNAs remain unchanged. Our observation on the association of PU-RNA with Purα at the early stage of brain development is interesting in light of our earlier studies (10Haas S. Gordon J. Khalili K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3103-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) demonstrating that association of Purα with MB1 DNA is developmentally regulated, with extremely low levels at the early stages of brain development (2–5 days) and maximizing in adults. The observed discrepancy in the abundance of Purα in newborn mice (shown in Fig. 3 A) and its extremely low binding ability to MB1 suggested that binding of Purα to MB1 DNA at the early stage of brain development may be regulated by a distinct mechanism. The inhibitory action of PU-RNA on the DNA (MB1) binding activity of Purα and its association with Purα produced in 3–5-day-old mouse brain suggested that PU-RNA may play a role in down-modulating binding of Purα to MB1 DNA at the early stage of brain development. Thus, one may envision a model whereby PU-RNA, by inhibiting DNA binding activity of Purα may indirectly affect MBP gene transcription at early, but not late, stages of brain development. In accord with this concept, results from band shift studies indicated that RNase treatment of the nuclear extract from 5-day-old mouse brain induces binding of nuclear proteins to the MB1 DNA probe. In this study, nuclear extracts from 5-day-old, 10-day-old, and adult (60-day-old) mouse brain were mixed with the oligonucleotide probe containing the Purα binding site, and the nucleoprotein complex was analyzed by native gel. Consistent with our previous data (10Haas S. Gordon J. Khalili K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3103-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a significant increase in Purα binding activity was detected in the mature brain extract (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 2 and 4). Treatment of the extract with RNase enhanced association of Purα from 5-day-old mouse brain extract to the DNA probe and exhibited an insignificant effect on binding activity of Purα from adult brain extract. These observations, along with the data presented in Fig. 1, strongly suggest that the association of Purα with the RNA molecule modulates DNA binding activity of Purα.Figure 4Production of Purα in brain during development and its association with PU-RNA.

As shown in Fig. 5 A, inclusion of PU-RNA in the binding reaction decreased the intensity of the band corresponding to Purα association with the MB1 DNA probe. In a separate series of studies, we compared the relative binding affinity of Purα to DNA and RNA molecules with similar nucleotide compositions. Toward this end, synthetic MB1 ribonucleic acid was used as a probe in the binding reaction in the absence and presence of unlabeled MB1 RNA, MB1 DNA, and nonspecific RNA competitors. As illustrated in Fig. 5 B, both MB1 RNA and MB1 DNA were able to inhibit PU-RNA-Purα complex formation. From the intensity of the ribonucleocomplex, however, it is evident that under the identical conditions, MB1 DNA is more effective than the MB1 RNA in dissociating the PU-RNA-Purα complex. The primary amino acid sequence of Purα demonstrates the well defined modular nature of the protein, which has no strong homologies to the known proteins (23Bergemann A.D. Ma Z.W. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5673-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Ma Z.W. Bergemann A.D. Johnson E.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 149: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The structural domains within Purα include (i) the stretch of 18 glycines, interrupted by one serine, in the N-terminal region of the protein"
https://openalex.org/W1770672913,"Localization of the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) molecule and its receptor (FSHR), as well as the role of FSH in Sertoli cell mitosis and maturation, has been demonstrated by several investigators in human and murine testis by detecting the localization of anti-FSH antibodies or [(131)I]-labeled FSH and by detecting FSH receptor (FSHR) mRNA by in situ hybridization, or FSHR by anti-FSHR antibodies. The presence of FSH in germinal cells is controversial or, in humans, excluded. We have investigated the distribution of the human FSH molecule and its receptor in human and mouse testicular cells under different experimental conditions, at the submicroscopical level, by using a better antigenicity conservative procedure. Thus, the distribution of FSH and of the messenger RNA for its receptor in Sertoli cells has now been clarified. In germinal cells, our observations demonstrate the presence of FSH and the FSHR mRNA: the first on the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles, and the second scattered in the cytoplasm. The cells presenting the higher amount of positivity ranged from spermatogonia to spermatocytes, including round spermatids. Penetration was by the endocytosis via membrane vesicles in which the FSHR is present, whereas its messenger is largely present in the cytoplasm and is responsible for the binding and subsequent internalization of the FSH molecule. As a control, human FSH was administered in vitro to the Y1 mouse cell line, which was stably transfected with cDNA for FSHR and devoid of endogenous FSH. The FSH molecule has been localized by monoclonal antibodies on plasma membranes and vesicles, and the FSHR mRNA was found scattered in the cytoplasm after in situ hybridization. We can now conclude that FSH is present in Sertoli cells and in round germinal cells, both expressing the FSHR. FSH penetrates in a similar way in both kinds of cells via endocytosis, and is therefore subsequently localized in the same membranous organelles."

In a two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with human MCM3, we identified and cloned a novel protein of which the calculated molecular weight is 80,291. A specific antibody against the protein identified a 80-kDa protein in HeLa cell extract, indicating the protein actually expressed in cells. The interaction of these proteins was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, we clarified a nuclear localization signal of human MCM3, and we find that mutagenesis on the nuclear localization signal of MCM3 affected the binding of newly isolated MCM3-assosiated protein, Map80. Map80 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion with His6 tag and purified with sequential column chromatographies. The addition of recombinant Map80 stimulated the amount of nuclear localized MCM3. These results suggest that Map80 is involved in the nuclear localization pathway of MCM3.

Moreover, we clarified a nuclear localization signal of human MCM3, and we find that mutagenesis on the nuclear localization signal of MCM3 affected the binding of newly isolated MCM3-assosiated protein, Map80. Map80 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion with His6 tag and purified with sequential column chromatographies. The addition of recombinant Map80 stimulated the amount of nuclear localized MCM3. These results suggest that Map80 is involved in the nuclear localization pathway of MCM3. The chromatin structure of DNA replication origins changes during the cell cycle, alternating between the prereplicative complex during the G1 phase and postreplicaive complex during the S, G2, and M phases (Refs. 1Liang C. Weinreich M. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 2Cocker J.H. Piatti S. Santocanale C. Nasmyth K. Diffley J.F.X.

Initiation of DNA replication requires the prior assembly of prereplicative complex. In fact, the regulation of prereplicative complex assembly appear to play a key role in restricting DNA replication to one round per cell cycle. Activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase that triggers DNA replication at prereplicative complex blocks assembly new prereplicative complex (see Ref. 4Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar for review). Thus, a key issue in the initiation of DNA replication is to identify the proteins that are component of the prereplicative complex and to understand their functions. Both origin recognition complex and Cdc6 protein are included in the prereplicative complex and required for the assembly and maintenance of the complex. The proteins known to be required for the initiation of DNA replication, such as MCM proteins, Cdc45 protein, and the Cdc7 protein kinase and its regulatory subunit Dbf4 protein, are also assembled in the complex (4Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar). It is currently thought that the origin recognition complex binds to the DNA origin directly and recruits Cdc6 protein, which in turn recruits MCM proteins on chromatin (5Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 6Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 270: 1667-1671Google Scholar, 7Rowles A. Chong J.P. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 286-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The complex needs to be activated by protein kinases, Cdc7/Dbf4, cyclin/Cdc2, and so on, to trigger the onset of the S phase (8Kitada K. Johnston L.H. Sugino T. Sugino A. Genetics. 1992; 31: 21-29Crossref Google Scholar, 9Jackson A.L. Pahl P.M. Harrison K. Rosamond J. Sclafani R.A. Mol. Cell.

MCM proteins associate with chromatin during the G1 phase and are released during the S phase, which could explain why G1 but not G2 nuclei were triggered to initiate DNA replication when cells are fused to S phase cells (11Liang C. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 12Young M. Tye B.-K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 8: 1587-1601Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this paper, to identify new members of the prereplicative complex, we screened human liver cDNA library by a two-hybrid method using MCM3 as a bait, and we identified a novel MCM3-associated protein.

All components were purchased fromCLONTECH, and all assays were carried out as suggested by the manufacturer. To obtain the MCM3-associated protein, bait was prepared by inserting the DNA fragment of hMCM3 encoding amino acids 556–728 into the pGBT9 and introduced into Hf7c. The pACT2 cDNA library prepared from human liver as a source of interacting proteins was introduced into the Hf7c pGBT9-hMCM3 strain. Then, 1 × 107 transformants were selected for tryptophan, leucine, and histidine prototrophy. Isolated colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity (13Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acid. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9576-9582Google Scholar, 14Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4837) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Map80 antibody was raised against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of amino acids 460–474 of Map80. Synthesis of peptide, immunization, and obtaining of the antisera were performed by Sawady Technology Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane at a constant voltage of 50 V for 1 h. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk in PBS and probed with antibody in 5% non-fat milk in PBS. The bound antibodies were detected with peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 1/500 dilution in 5% non-fat milk in PBS, and the protein bands were visualized by the colorimetric method with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as substrate (15Takei Y. Kurosu H. Takahashi K. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5085-5089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA fragment of hMCM3 encoding amino acids 556–728 was inserted into the pEGFP C2 vector (CLONTECH). The fragment of GFP and hMCM3 cDNA was amplified by the PCR method with an appropriate primer set. The amplified fragment was inserted into the pTrcHis vector (Invitrogen). The induced protein was purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column (Qiagen). The fractions eluded with 250 mm imidazole were dialyzed against import buffer (20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.4, 110 mmpotassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mmsodium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 2 mmdithiothreitol). Map80 was expressed as a fusion protein with the amino-terminal His6 tag by pTrcHis vector (Invitrogen) into the BL21. The bacterially expressed Map80 was purified from crude extract with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column. The fractions eluded with 250 mm imidazole were dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The dialyzed sample was applied on the Mono Q HR 5/5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column and eluded by the linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl. The fractions containing Map80 were applied on the Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated by import buffer. Nuclear import reactions were performed as described (16Adam S.A. Sterne Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) on digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells, except for the addition of GTP (0.1 mm). Human red blood cell cytosol was prepared as described (16Adam S.A. Sterne Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Takei Y. Takahashi K. Kanaho Y. Katada T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The transport substrates were added at a concentration of 10–20 μg/ml. After 60-min incubation at 30 °C, the cells were washed with import buffer and then analyzed by confocal microscopy. While screening for proteins that interact with the hMCM3 in a two-hybrid assay, we discovered a novel interacting protein. The newly identified protein, Map80 (MCM3-associated protein 80), is 721 amino acids long (Fig.1 A), with a calculated molecular weight of 80,291 and an estimated pI of 5.14. Comparison of the DNA sequence with sequences in the GenBankTM data base reveals strong homology to the human STS sequences (GenBankTM/EBI/DDBJ accession numbers G15578 and G34586). We prepared a polyclonal antibody against a partial sequence of Map80 isolated here, corresponding to amino acids 460–474, and used the antisera for immunoblotting of a HeLa cell extract. As shown in Fig.1 B, the antisera detected a single band of approximately 80 kDa, which is in good agreement with the size of the predicted molecular weight. Together with the presence of an in-frame termination codon upstream from the putative initiation codon (see GenBankTM/EBI/DDBJ accession number AB005543), these results indicate that the cDNA obtained encodes the full length of Map80 cDNA. To confirm the binding of Map80 to the hMCM3, Map80 was expressed in HeLa cells as a fusion protein with an amino-terminal HA-epitope tag (Fig.2 A). The hMCM3 was precipitated with the anti-HA tag antibody when the HA-tagged Map80 was expressed (Fig. 2 B). The anti-HA tag antibody failed to precipitate the hMCM3 in the control cell extract, in which the HA-tagged Map80 was absent (data not shown). These results indicated that Map80 can bind to the intact hMCM3 expressed in HeLa cells. Furthermore, we examined whether Map80 can bind to the other members of human MCM protein family. Yeast two-hybrid assay showed that the hMCM3 could induce the β-galactosidase activity in the presence of Map80, whereas each of the other MCM proteins, MCM2, MCM5, and MCM7, failed to induce (Fig. 3). These results indicate that Map80 can bind only to the hMCM3 in a two-hybrid system. Xenopus MCM3 (XMCM3) was shown not to be imported into the nucleus, in contrast to hMCM3 (18Kubota Y. Mimura S. Nishimoto S. Takisawa H. Nojima H. Cell. 1995; 81: 601-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences corresponding to the putative NLS region were compared. A cluster of basic amino acid residues, which is important for the function of the NLS (19Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar), was identified in hMCM3 but not in XMCM3 (Fig.4 A). We prepared “mut. MCM3,” which is the same as hMCM3 except that 4 amino acids have been replaced with the corresponding amino acids of XMCM3 (Fig.4 A), and compared the cellular localization of these three MCM3 proteins, i.e. hMCM3, XMCM3, and mut. MCM3. As shown in Fig. 4 B, hMCM3 was localized in the nucleus, whereas XMCM3 was in the cytoplasm, and mut. MCM3 was in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The mutagenesis on putative NLS of hMCM3 affected the nuclear localization of hMCM3, indicating that the sequence was responsible for the localization of MCM3. Furthermore, as shown in Fig.4 C, the mutagenesis affected the interaction between Map80 and hMCM3 in a two-hybrid system. Map80 interacted with hMCM3 and weakly with mut. MCM3, but not with XMCM3. These results suggest that Map80 is necessary for the nuclear localization of hMCM3. Map80 was expressed in E. coli and purified by several sequential column chromatographies (Fig.5 A). We prepared a fusion protein of hMCM3 and GFP (hMCM3-GFP) as a substrate for the nuclear import assay. The import of hMCM3-GFP was clearly observed in the presence of human red blood cell cytosol, ATP, and GTP (Fig.5 B). The recombinant Map80 alone failed to import the hMCM3-GFP into the nucleus in the absence of cytosol (Fig.5 C). In the presence of smaller amounts of the cytosol, the nuclear import of the hMCM3-GFP became much weaker (Fig. 5 D) than the standard (Fig. 5 B); however, the recombinant Map80 noticeably facilitated the import even in the presence of smaller amounts of the cytosol (Fig. 5 E). These results indicate that Map80 plays a role related to the localization of hMCM3. We demonstrated that the newly isolated Map80 could bind to the hMCM3 and also indicated that Map80 is involved in the nuclear localization of MCM3. Although Map80 only interacted with MCM3 but not with other MCM proteins (Fig. 3), the data cannot deny the possibility that Map80 participates in the localization mechanism of other MCM proteins, because the MCM proteins are now considered to exist as heterocomplexes (20Kimura H.

Import of karyopheric protein from cytosol to nucleus is mediated by soluble proteins of the importin/karyopherin α and β families (24Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F.

The importin/karyopherin α binds to both the NLS within the karyopheric protein and importin/karyopherin β, simultaneously, and the importin/karyopherin β interacts with nucleoporins of the cytoplasmic face of a nuclear pore. We could not find any homologous sequence between Map80 and importin/karyopherin (Fig. 1 A), whereas the mutagenesis on the NLS of MCM3 affected the binding of Map80 (Fig. 4). Map80 may not participate in the import of MCM3 but stabilize the nuclear localization of MCM3 by interacting with other karyopheric materials, such as chromatin or other karyopheric protein. It is tempting to speculate that Map80 has some function in the nucleus, because a fusion protein of Map80 and DNA binding domain of GAL4 activated the reporter gene transcription in yeast (data not shown). The MCM protein is identified as a member of the prereplicative complex, licensing machinery, which prevents reinitiation of replication within a single cell cycle (22Thömmes P. Kubota Y. Takisawa H. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3312-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Kubota Y. Mimura S. Nishimoto S. Masuda T. Nojima H. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3320-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Further investigation will clarify whether Map80 also participates in the prereplication complex. We are grateful to Dr. T. Kishimoto and Dr. K. Tachibana (Laboratory of Cell and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan) for the generous gift of the Xenopus cDNA. We also thank R. Misumi and T.

However, no protein directly mediates these two enzyme systems. Here we show that RGS9, which is suggested to control PDE activity through regulation of transducin GTPase activity (He, W., Cowan, C. W., and Wensel, T. G. (1998) Neuron 20, 95–102), directly interacts with GC. When proteins in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of bovine rod outer segments were isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and binding of GC to these proteins was examined using a GC-specific antibody, proteins (55 and 32 kDa) were found to interact with GC. However, the activity of GC bound to the 55-kDa protein was not detected. This observation was elucidated by the finding that the 55-kDa protein inhibited GC activity in a dose-dependent manner. Amino acid sequence showed that five peptides derived from the 55-kDa protein were identical to corresponding peptides of RGS9. Together with other biochemical characterization of the 55-kDa protein, these observations indicate that the 55-kDa protein is RGS9 and that RGS9 inhibits GC.

The resulting decrease of cytoplasmic [cGMP] leads to closure of cGMP-gated channels and hyperpolarization of photoreceptor plasma membranes. The closure of channels also blocks Ca2+ influx, whereas Ca2+ efflux by Na+/Ca2+ exchangers continues. The resulting decline in free [Ca2+] activates GC. With inactivation of GTP/Tα-activated PDE by GTP hydrolysis on Tα and return of Pγ to Pαβ, the GC activation serves to restore [cGMP] to the dark level. It has never been reported that any protein directly mediates between the PDE system and the GC system.Recent studies have shown that regulation of PDE for the restoration of [cGMP] to the dark level is really complicated. Kawamura and Murakami (4Kawamura S. Murakami M. Nature. 1991; 349: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) have suggested a mechanism to regulate the lifetime of GTP/Tα-activated PDE. He et al. (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G.

Phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 of Pγ complexed with GTP/Tα may also be involved in the regulation of lifetime of GTP/Tα-activated PDE. 2V. A. Bondarenko, I. Matsuura, Y.

We have expected that GC is also regulated by cytoskeletal proteins. In this study, we isolated GC-binding proteins (GCBPs) from a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of bovine ROS. Partial amino acid sequences indicate that one of the GCBPs, GCBP-55, is identical to RGS9. Purification and characterization of GCBP-55 (RGS9) suggest that the protein interacts with GC and inhibits GC activity. We anticipate that GCBP-55 (RGS9) may control cytoplasmic [cGMP] through direct interaction with proteins involved in both the PDE and GC systems.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRetinal GC has a single membrane-spanning domain that divides the protein into two roughly equal portions, an N-terminal extracellular domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (15Goraczniak R.M.

We have speculated that GC may associate with cytoskeletal proteins through these interactions. Proteins in a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of bovine ROS were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were blotted to PVDF membranes. Then purified GC was overlaid to these proteins, and GCBPs were identified using a GC-specific antibody. In the alkaline region, a single protein (55 kDa; pI, more than 8.0) bound to GC (Fig. 1 B). The protein (GCBP-55) was also recognized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.1 A). Purified GCBP-55, which is described below, was also detected in the same spot in the gels (data not shown). These observations indicate that a relatively large amount of GCBP-55 is present in bovine ROS. By comparing the immunoblot signal of GCBP-55 in ROS with those of known amounts of purified GCBP-55 on the same PVDF membranes, we estimate that 1 GCBP-55/1000∼2000 rhodopsin is present in bovine ROS. In the acidic region, two major signals around molecular mass 32 kDa (32-kDa GCBPs) and several minor signals (25, 20, and 12 kDa) were found (Fig. 1 E). However, these GCBPs appear to be less abundant than GCBP-55 because these proteins were not detected by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1 D). 32-kDa GCBPs may be different from GCAPs because of their different molecular mass. We note that only endogenous GC was detected if the GC overlay was omitted (Fig. 1, C and F), indicating that the GC antibody used does not cross-react with all proteins except GC in ROS. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that purified GCBP-55 also revealed GC binding activity in GC overlay experiments (data not shown).We also tried to detect these GCBPs by measuring the activity of GC bound to these proteins. After isolation of these GCBPs by SDS gel electrophoresis and blotting to PVDF membranes, the membranes were incubated with purified GC, and the activity of GC bound to GCBPs was measured. As shown in Fig. 2, GCBPs with lower molecular mass were clearly detected; however, GCBP-55 was not detected by this method. These data suggested that GC bound to GCBP-55 is inhibited. Thus, we examined the effect of GCBP-55 on the activity of purified GC. As shown in Fig. 3, GCBP-55 inhibited GC activity in a dose-dependent manner. Boiled GCBP-55 was inactive. We note that the inhibitory activity was coeluted with GCBP-55 from both the immunoaffinity and the ion exchange (Econo S) columns. GCBP-55 is not the GC inhibitor reported recently (14Li N.

Proteins (50 μg) of a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8–18%). After blotting to a PVDF membrane, the membrane was incubated with purified GC (0.3 μg/ml) in buffer E (overnight, 4 °C). Following washing, the membrane was cut into 3-mm strips. The activity of GC bound to GCBPs on these strips was measured. A, GC activity in these PVDF membrane strips. B, protein profile of Triton X-100-insoluble fractions.

A computer search indicates that all amino acid residues that we identified in five sequences were identical to the corresponding amino acid residues of RGS9 (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These five sequences contain 125 amino acid residues (i.e. more than 25% of the amino acid sequence of RGS9). These data suggest that GCBP-55 is identical to RGS9. RGS9 has been reported to be a member of RGS family, and the protein may be specific for photoreceptors. The following observations also support the idea that GCBP-55 and RGS9 are identical. (a) The molecular mass of GCBP-55 is similar to that of RGS9. The sequence of the bovine RGS9 open reading frame indicates that RGS9 is a 484-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 56.7 kDa (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). (b) The pI value of GCBP-55 was estimated to be more than 8.0 by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). We note that under our conditions it is difficult to measure a pI value of more than 8.0. Calculation from the amino acid sequence indicates that the pI value of RGS9 is 9.54. (c) The localization of GCBP-55 has been shown in rod and cone photoreceptors in mammalian retinas by both light and electron microscopes (27Nishizawa Y. Seno K. Ihara S. Kachi S. Watanabe N. Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Usukura J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 4855Google Scholar). RGS9 is also reported to be localized in ROS, although higher expression was observed in cone (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 28Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). (d) Both GCBP-55 and RGS9 are membrane-bound. Without detergent any buffer containing low salt (5 mm), moderate salt (100∼200 mm), or high salt (1–1.5 m) with or without GTP could not solubilize GCBP-55 (data not shown). Complete solubilization of GCBP-55 required a buffer containing Triton X-100 (2–5%) and KCl (1–1.5 m). We note that conditions required for the complete solubilization of GCBP-55 are the same conditions for the solubilization of GC (10Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Hakki S. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the GCBP-55 was observed in Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of ROS, approximately 40–50% of total GCBP-55 was partially solubilized with 2% Triton X-100. This result was similar to the results reported by He et al. and others (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G.

(a) The Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilicity-plot clearly indicates that RGS9 is very hydrophilic. We cannot understand why GCBP-55 (RGS9) requires nonionic detergents for its solubilization. The simplest explanation might be that GCBP-55 (RGS9) is modified by lipid and binds tightly to a Triton X-100-insoluble protein(s) through hydrophobic interaction. However, neither any predicted transmembrane region nor sequence for isoprenylation and myristoylation sequence is present in RGS9. Palmitoylation seems to be unlikely (28Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We speculate that GC is a protein binding to RGS9 in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. (b) RGS9 has been proposed to be an activator for the hydrolysis of GTP on Tα, and the activation is accelerated by Pγ (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We do not know how membrane-bound RGS9 (GCBP-55) interacts with GTP-bound Tα in disk membranes, because Tα becomes soluble after GTP binding. We must confirm the acceleration of GTP hydrolysis by using RGS9 purified from bovine ROS. Pγ did not stimulate the GCBP-55 inhibitory activity on GC activity (data not shown). (c) GC isoforms are present in ROS. GC used in this study appears to be a mixture of GC isomers. We do not know which GC is sensitive to GCBP-55 (RGS9). (d) The role of GC inhibitor is not clear in the prevailing model of phototransduction. In the current model, the basal GC activity is low, and the GC activity is increased by Ca2+-sensitive activators (GCAPs) when Ca2+concentration is decreased after hydrolysis of cGMP by PDE (1Koutalos Y. Yau K.-W. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 73-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 2Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. Int. Rev.

Thus, Ca2+ is an indirect mediator between the PDE system and the GC system, and a GC inhibitor is not required. At present neither the effect of Ca2+ nor the effect of GCAPs on the GCBP-dependent inhibition of GC activity is known. In this study we suggest that GCBP-55 (RGS9) directly interacts with GC and inhibits GC activity in a system reconstituted by purified proteins. Our observations suggest that GCBP-55 (RGS9) may function as a protein that mediates between the PDE system and the GC system. In the prevailing model of phototransduction (1Koutalos Y. Yau K.-W.

The resulting decrease of cytoplasmic [cGMP] leads to closure of cGMP-gated channels and hyperpolarization of photoreceptor plasma membranes. The closure of channels also blocks Ca2+ influx, whereas Ca2+ efflux by Na+/Ca2+ exchangers continues. The resulting decline in free [Ca2+] activates GC. With inactivation of GTP/Tα-activated PDE by GTP hydrolysis on Tα and return of Pγ to Pαβ, the GC activation serves to restore [cGMP] to the dark level.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) have suggested that RGS9, a retina-specific member of RGS family, accelerates hydrolysis of GTP bound to Tα and that this acceleration may shorten the lifetime of GTP/Tα-activated PDE. Phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 of Pγ complexed with GTP/Tα may also be involved in the regulation of lifetime of GTP/Tα-activated PDE. 2V. A. Bondarenko, I. Matsuura, Y.

We have expected that GC is also regulated by cytoskeletal proteins. In this study, we isolated GC-binding proteins (GCBPs) from a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of bovine ROS. Partial amino acid sequences indicate that one of the GCBPs, GCBP-55, is identical to RGS9. Purification and characterization of GCBP-55 (RGS9) suggest that the protein interacts with GC and inhibits GC activity. We anticipate that GCBP-55 (RGS9) may control cytoplasmic [cGMP] through direct interaction with proteins involved in both the PDE and GC systems. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRetinal GC has a single membrane-spanning domain that divides the protein into two roughly equal portions, an N-terminal extracellular domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (15Goraczniak R.M.

We speculate that GC is a protein binding to RGS9 in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. (b) RGS9 has been proposed to be an activator for the hydrolysis of GTP on Tα, and the activation is accelerated by Pγ (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We do not know how membrane-bound RGS9 (GCBP-55) interacts with GTP-bound Tα in disk membranes, because Tα becomes soluble after GTP binding. We must confirm the acceleration of GTP hydrolysis by using RGS9 purified from bovine ROS. Pγ did not stimulate the GCBP-55 inhibitory activity on GC activity (data not shown). (c) GC isoforms are present in ROS. GC used in this study appears to be a mixture of GC isomers. We do not know which GC is sensitive to GCBP-55 (RGS9). (d) The role of GC inhibitor is not clear in the prevailing model of phototransduction. In the current model, the basal GC activity is low, and the GC activity is increased by Ca2+-sensitive activators (GCAPs) when Ca2+concentration is decreased after hydrolysis of cGMP by PDE (1Koutalos Y. Yau K.-W. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 73-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 2Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. Int. Rev.

Thus, Ca2+ is an indirect mediator between the PDE system and the GC system, and a GC inhibitor is not required. At present neither the effect of Ca2+ nor the effect of GCAPs on the GCBP-dependent inhibition of GC activity is known. In this study we suggest that GCBP-55 (RGS9) directly interacts with GC and inhibits GC activity in a system reconstituted by purified proteins. Our observations suggest that GCBP-55 (RGS9) may function as a protein that mediates between the PDE system and the GC system. Retinal GC has a single membrane-spanning domain that divides the protein into two roughly equal portions, an N-terminal extracellular domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (15Goraczniak R.M.

A. 1991; 88: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Hakki S. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) requires both high concentrations of salts, such as 1 m KCl, and nonionic detergents, such as Triton X-100, suggesting that GC binds to disk membranes through hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. We have speculated that GC may associate with cytoskeletal proteins through these interactions. Proteins in a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of bovine ROS were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were blotted to PVDF membranes. Then purified GC was overlaid to these proteins, and GCBPs were identified using a GC-specific antibody. In the alkaline region, a single protein (55 kDa; pI, more than 8.0) bound to GC (Fig. 1 B). The protein (GCBP-55) was also recognized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.1 A). Purified GCBP-55, which is described below, was also detected in the same spot in the gels (data not shown). These observations indicate that a relatively large amount of GCBP-55 is present in bovine ROS. By comparing the immunoblot signal of GCBP-55 in ROS with those of known amounts of purified GCBP-55 on the same PVDF membranes, we estimate that 1 GCBP-55/1000∼2000 rhodopsin is present in bovine ROS. In the acidic region, two major signals around molecular mass 32 kDa (32-kDa GCBPs) and several minor signals (25, 20, and 12 kDa) were found (Fig. 1 E). However, these GCBPs appear to be less abundant than GCBP-55 because these proteins were not detected by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1 D). 32-kDa GCBPs may be different from GCAPs because of their different molecular mass. We note that only endogenous GC was detected if the GC overlay was omitted (Fig. 1, C and F), indicating that the GC antibody used does not cross-react with all proteins except GC in ROS. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that purified GCBP-55 also revealed GC binding activity in GC overlay experiments (data not shown). We also tried to detect these GCBPs by measuring the activity of GC bound to these proteins. After isolation of these GCBPs by SDS gel electrophoresis and blotting to PVDF membranes, the membranes were incubated with purified GC, and the activity of GC bound to GCBPs was measured. As shown in Fig. 2, GCBPs with lower molecular mass were clearly detected; however, GCBP-55 was not detected by this method. These data suggested that GC bound to GCBP-55 is inhibited. Thus, we examined the effect of GCBP-55 on the activity of purified GC. As shown in Fig. 3, GCBP-55 inhibited GC activity in a dose-dependent manner. Boiled GCBP-55 was inactive. We note that the inhibitory activity was coeluted with GCBP-55 from both the immunoaffinity and the ion exchange (Econo S) columns. GCBP-55 is not the GC inhibitor reported recently (14Li N. Fariss R.N. Zhang K. OttoBruc A. Haeseleer F. Bronson D. Qin N. Yamazaki A. Subbaraya I. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), because amino acid sequences in these proteins are completely different, as described below. We have analyzed the amino acid sequence of the N terminus of GCBP-55 and four peptides derived from purified GCBP-55 (Fig.4). A computer search indicates that all amino acid residues that we identified in five sequences were identical to the corresponding amino acid residues of RGS9 (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These five sequences contain 125 amino acid residues (i.e. more than 25% of the amino acid sequence of RGS9). These data suggest that GCBP-55 is identical to RGS9. RGS9 has been reported to be a member of RGS family, and the protein may be specific for photoreceptors. The following observations also support the idea that GCBP-55 and RGS9 are identical. (a) The molecular mass of GCBP-55 is similar to that of RGS9. The sequence of the bovine RGS9 open reading frame indicates that RGS9 is a 484-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 56.7 kDa (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). (b) The pI value of GCBP-55 was estimated to be more than 8.0 by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). We note that under our conditions it is difficult to measure a pI value of more than 8.0. Calculation from the amino acid sequence indicates that the pI value of RGS9 is 9.54. (c) The localization of GCBP-55 has been shown in rod and cone photoreceptors in mammalian retinas by both light and electron microscopes (27Nishizawa Y. Seno K. Ihara S. Kachi S. Watanabe N. Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Usukura J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 4855Google Scholar). RGS9 is also reported to be localized in ROS, although higher expression was observed in cone (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 28Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). (d) Both GCBP-55 and RGS9 are membrane-bound. Without detergent any buffer containing low salt (5 mm), moderate salt (100∼200 mm), or high salt (1–1.5 m) with or without GTP could not solubilize GCBP-55 (data not shown). Complete solubilization of GCBP-55 required a buffer containing Triton X-100 (2–5%) and KCl (1–1.5 m). We note that conditions required for the complete solubilization of GCBP-55 are the same conditions for the solubilization of GC (10Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Hakki S. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the GCBP-55 was observed in Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of ROS, approximately 40–50% of total GCBP-55 was partially solubilized with 2% Triton X-100. This result was similar to the results reported by He et al. and others (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 28Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); approximately 50% of RGS9 was solubilized by 30 mm octylglucoside. There are several questions in this study. (a) The Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilicity-plot clearly indicates that RGS9 is very hydrophilic. We cannot understand why GCBP-55 (RGS9) requires nonionic detergents for its solubilization. The simplest explanation might be that GCBP-55 (RGS9) is modified by lipid and binds tightly to a Triton X-100-insoluble protein(s) through hydrophobic interaction. However, neither any predicted transmembrane region nor sequence for isoprenylation and myristoylation sequence is present in RGS9. Palmitoylation seems to be unlikely (28Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We speculate that GC is a protein binding to RGS9 in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. (b) RGS9 has been proposed to be an activator for the hydrolysis of GTP on Tα, and the activation is accelerated by Pγ (5He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We do not know how membrane-bound RGS9 (GCBP-55) interacts with GTP-bound Tα in disk membranes, because Tα becomes soluble after GTP binding. We must confirm the acceleration of GTP hydrolysis by using RGS9 purified from bovine ROS. Pγ did not stimulate the GCBP-55 inhibitory activity on GC activity (data not shown). (c) GC isoforms are present in ROS. GC used in this study appears to be a mixture of GC isomers. We do not know which GC is sensitive to GCBP-55 (RGS9). (d) The role of GC inhibitor is not clear in the prevailing model of phototransduction. In the current model, the basal GC activity is low, and the GC activity is increased by Ca2+-sensitive activators (GCAPs) when Ca2+concentration is decreased after hydrolysis of cGMP by PDE (1Koutalos Y.

Thus, Ca2+ is an indirect mediator between the PDE system and the GC system, and a GC inhibitor is not required. At present neither the effect of Ca2+ nor the effect of GCAPs on the GCBP-dependent inhibition of GC activity is known. In this study we suggest that GCBP-55 (RGS9) directly interacts with GC and inhibits GC activity in a system reconstituted by purified proteins. Our observations suggest that GCBP-55 (RGS9) may function as a protein that mediates between the PDE system and the GC system. We thank Drs.W. H. Miller and N. G.

https://openalex.org/W1968421667,"Arsenic is a potent toxin and carcinogen. In prokaryotes, arsenic detoxification is accomplished by chromosomal and plasmid-borne operon-encoded efflux systems. We have previously reported the cloning of hASNA-I, a human homologue of arsA encoding the ATPase component of the Escherichia coli arsenite transporter. Purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-hASNA-I fusion protein was biochemically characterized, and its properties were compared with those of ArsA. The GST-hASNA-I exhibited a basal level of ATPase activity of 18.5 ± 8 nmol/min/mg in the absence of arsenite. Arsenite produced a 1.6 ± 0.1-fold stimulation of activity (p = 0.0044), which was related to an increase in Vmax; antimonite did not stimulate activity. Two lines of evidence suggest that an oligomer is the most likely native form of hASNA-I. First, lysates of human embryo kidney 293 cells overproducing recombinant hASNA-I produced a single monomeric 37-kDa band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and two distinct species when analyzed using nondenaturing PAGE. Second, chemical cross-linking of the 63-kDa GST-hASNA-I resulted in the formation of dimeric and tetrameric protein forms. The results indicate that hASNA-I is a distinct human arsenite-stimulated ATPase belonging to the same superfamily of ATPases represented by the E. coli ArsA protein.

Arsenic is a toxic metalloid whose reactive trivalent and pentavalent ions can influence a number of biochemical processes. In bacteria, arsenic detoxification is mediated by specific chromosomal (1Carlin A. Shi W. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 2Diorio C.

Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) encoding efflux systems that confer low and high level resistance to arsenic, respectively. The well characterized plasmid-borne arsoperon of Escherichia coli is composed of two regulatory (arsR and arsD) and three structural (arsA, arsB, and ars C) genes. An oxyanion-dependent ATPase is encoded by the arsAgene and associates with the channel-forming transmembrane protein encoded for by arsB (5Rosen B.P. Hsu C.M. Karkaria C.E. Kaur P. Owolabi J.B. Tisa L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). ArsC is an arsenate reductase (6Gladysheva T.B. Oden K.L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast to the plasmid-borne ars operon of E. coli, both its chromosomal ars operon and the plasmid-borne operon in Gram-positive bacteria lack arsD and arsA (7Ji G. Silver S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3684-3694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rosenstein R. Peschel A. Wieland B. Gotz F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3676-3683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In mammalian cells, although evidence for the presence of an ATP-dependent arsenite efflux system has been reported (9Wang Z. Dey S. Rosen B.P. Rossman T.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 137: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), none of its components have been molecularly isolated. As part of our efforts to identify genes involved in drug and arsenite resistance, we focused our efforts on the isolation of the human homologue of the bacterial ATP-binding ArsA protein, a putative component of an arsenite efflux pump in human cells.The ArsA protein is a member of a superfamily of ATP-binding proteins with a distinct nucleotide (NTP)-binding motif different from that of other ATPases, including the cation-translocating transporters. We have previously isolated the human hASNA-I cDNA utilizing homology to the distinct NTP-binding motif. It codes for a 37-kDa ATPase with a single ATP-binding cassette and is the first reported mammalian member of this superfamily of ATPases (10Kurdi-Haidar B. Aebi S. Heath D. Enns R.E. Naredi P. Hom D.K. Howell S.B. Genomics. 1996; 36: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the biochemical characterization of hASNA-I expressed either as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST 1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferaseEEDQN-(ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinolineEDAC1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcabodiimide hydrochlorideMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidBSAbovine serum albumin.1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferaseEEDQN-(ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinolineEDAC1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcabodiimide hydrochlorideMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidBSAbovine serum albumin.-hASNA-I) in bacteria or as a native protein in hASNA-I-transfected human embryo kidney 293 cells. The results indicate that hASNA-I is biochemically a distinct arsenite-stimulated rather than an arsenite-dependent ATPase and that it shares some of the biochemical properties of the bacterial ArsA.DISCUSSIONWe have previously reported the cloning of the hASNA-IcDNA (10Kurdi-Haidar B. Aebi S. Heath D. Enns R.E. Naredi P. Hom D.K. Howell S.B. Genomics. 1996; 36: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), encoding the first eukaryotic member of the superfamily of ATPases represented by the bacterial ArsA (18Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In the absence of a simple method to purify the hASNA-I protein itself, we used a GST-hASNA-I fusion protein. A number of features distinguish this human ATPase from its bacterial counterpart. An oxyanion-independent basal ATPase activity of 18.5 nmol/min/mg was measured for the hASNA-I, that is 3-fold lower than that of the basal ATPase activity of the E. coli ArsA. Unlike the bacterial enzyme whose activity is induced 4-fold by arsenite and 32-fold by antimonite (19Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the basal activity of hASNA-I was stimulated only 1.6-fold in the presence of arsenite and was not affected by the presence of antimonite.The E. coli ArsA is a 63-kDa protein with two ATP-binding cassettes, functions as a homodimer that can be chemically cross-linked (15Hsu C.M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dupuis A. Lunardi J. Issartel J.P. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and its functional form contains four ATP-binding domains. DNA sequence information indicated that hASNA-I contained a single ATP-binding cassette and a predicted size of 37 kDa, half the size of the bacterial ArsA. The monomeric size of the human hASNA-I was confirmed by Western blotting using SDS-PAGE and an anti-hASNA-I antibody (10Kurdi-Haidar B. Aebi S. Heath D. Enns R.E. Naredi P. Hom D.K. Howell S.B. Genomics. 1996; 36: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, Western analysis of lysates from hASNA-I overproducing cells, carried out under nondenaturing PAGE, showed two distinct bands representing two species of the hASNA-I protein. This finding was confirmed by the appearance of dimers and tetramers of chemically cross-linked purified GST-hASNA-I fusion protein. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, similar to the E. coli ArsA, the active form of hASNA-I is likely to contain four ATP-binding domains assembled as a tetramer.It is noteworthy that, although the hASNA-I cDNA was isolated using homology to the bacterial arsA and the protein it encodes is functionally an ATPase, the hASNA-I is a biochemically distinct enzyme. The activities of both prokaryotic and the eukaryotic enzymes are stimulated in the presence of arsenite; however, the underlying mechanism by which this takes place appears to be different. The activation and dimerization of the E. coliArsA are dependent on the presence of oxyanions, with antimonite rather than arsenite being the major effector (15Hsu C.M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, although the activity of the hASNA-I is mildly affected by the presence of arsenite and antimonite had no effect. Likewise, the oligomeric state of the GST-hASNA-I was not influenced by the presence of arsenite.The presence of the distinct NTP-binding motif in the hASNA-I and the bacterial ArsA places both within the same superfamily of ATPases. In E. coli the ArsA operates in concert with the ArsB, the transmembrane channel, to efflux arsenite. Our current knowledge does not allow us to establish whether the hASNA-I and the E. coli ArsA are orthologs, with an evolutionary conserved function, or whether they are functionally distinct paralogs. Isolation of the human ArsB homolog, the putative transmembrane channel is necessary before the role of hASNA-I as a component of a human efflux pump for arsenite detoxification can be tested. It remains possible that both the hASNA-I and the E. coli ArsA are paralogs having descended from an ancestral arsenite-responsive ATPase and may play different roles in cellular metabolism. Arsenic is a toxic metalloid whose reactive trivalent and pentavalent ions can influence a number of biochemical processes. In bacteria, arsenic detoxification is mediated by specific chromosomal (1Carlin A. Shi W. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 2Diorio C.

DISCUSSIONWe have previously reported the cloning of the hASNA-IcDNA (10Kurdi-Haidar B. Aebi S. Heath D. Enns R.E. Naredi P. Hom D.K. Howell S.B. Genomics. 1996; 36: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), encoding the first eukaryotic member of the superfamily of ATPases represented by the bacterial ArsA (18Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In the absence of a simple method to purify the hASNA-I protein itself, we used a GST-hASNA-I fusion protein. A number of features distinguish this human ATPase from its bacterial counterpart. An oxyanion-independent basal ATPase activity of 18.5 nmol/min/mg was measured for the hASNA-I, that is 3-fold lower than that of the basal ATPase activity of the E. coli ArsA. Unlike the bacterial enzyme whose activity is induced 4-fold by arsenite and 32-fold by antimonite (19Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the basal activity of hASNA-I was stimulated only 1.6-fold in the presence of arsenite and was not affected by the presence of antimonite.The E. coli ArsA is a 63-kDa protein with two ATP-binding cassettes, functions as a homodimer that can be chemically cross-linked (15Hsu C.M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dupuis A. Lunardi J. Issartel J.P. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and its functional form contains four ATP-binding domains. DNA sequence information indicated that hASNA-I contained a single ATP-binding cassette and a predicted size of 37 kDa, half the size of the bacterial ArsA. The monomeric size of the human hASNA-I was confirmed by Western blotting using SDS-PAGE and an anti-hASNA-I antibody (10Kurdi-Haidar B. Aebi S. Heath D. Enns R.E. Naredi P. Hom D.K. Howell S.B. Genomics. 1996; 36: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, Western analysis of lysates from hASNA-I overproducing cells, carried out under nondenaturing PAGE, showed two distinct bands representing two species of the hASNA-I protein. This finding was confirmed by the appearance of dimers and tetramers of chemically cross-linked purified GST-hASNA-I fusion protein. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, similar to the E. coli ArsA, the active form of hASNA-I is likely to contain four ATP-binding domains assembled as a tetramer.It is noteworthy that, although the hASNA-I cDNA was isolated using homology to the bacterial arsA and the protein it encodes is functionally an ATPase, the hASNA-I is a biochemically distinct enzyme. The activities of both prokaryotic and the eukaryotic enzymes are stimulated in the presence of arsenite; however, the underlying mechanism by which this takes place appears to be different. The activation and dimerization of the E. coliArsA are dependent on the presence of oxyanions, with antimonite rather than arsenite being the major effector (15Hsu C.M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, although the activity of the hASNA-I is mildly affected by the presence of arsenite and antimonite had no effect. Likewise, the oligomeric state of the GST-hASNA-I was not influenced by the presence of arsenite.The presence of the distinct NTP-binding motif in the hASNA-I and the bacterial ArsA places both within the same superfamily of ATPases. In E. coli the ArsA operates in concert with the ArsB, the transmembrane channel, to efflux arsenite. Our current knowledge does not allow us to establish whether the hASNA-I and the E. coli ArsA are orthologs, with an evolutionary conserved function, or whether they are functionally distinct paralogs. Isolation of the human ArsB homolog, the putative transmembrane channel is necessary before the role of hASNA-I as a component of a human efflux pump for arsenite detoxification can be tested. It remains possible that both the hASNA-I and the E. coli ArsA are paralogs having descended from an ancestral arsenite-responsive ATPase and may play different roles in cellular metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W1494456818,"The spindle-shaped cell line TTB was recently isolated from highly vascularized skin lesions of BKV/HIV-1 tat transgenic mice and shown to possess an autocrine loop for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We show that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) stimulates TTB cell migration and promotes polarization of uPAR at the leading edge of migrating cells. FGF-stimulated TTB cells presented the typical migratory phenotype, with a triangular cell shape and concomitant breakdown of actin stress fibers and smooth muscle-specific actin isoform. FGF-2-stimulated migration was blocked by antibodies against urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) or uPA receptor (uPAR) and by neutralizing anti-HGF antibodies. The latter also inhibited uPAR relocalization at the cell surface of FGF-2-treated TTB cells. This points to a crosstalk between FGF-2 and HGF that might mediate TTB cell migration by modulating the localization of cell surface uPAR."
https://openalex.org/W2091994604,"We have developed a rapid, high throughput screening assay for compounds that alter the assembly of glycosaminoglycan chains in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The assay uses autoradiography to measure the binding of newly synthesized [35S]proteoglycans and [35S]glycosaminoglycans to a positively charged membrane. Screening over 1000 extracts from a random plant collection obtained from the Amazon rain forest yielded five plants that stimulated glycosaminoglycan assembly in both wild-type cells and a mutant cell line defective in xylosyltransferase (the first committed enzyme involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis). Fractionation of an extract of Maieta guianensis by silica gel and reverse-phase chromatography yielded two pure compounds with stimulatory activity. Spectroscopic analysis by NMR and mass spectrometry revealed that the active principles were xylosides of dimethylated ellagic acid. One of the compounds also contained a galloyl group at C-3 of the xylose moiety. These findings suggest that plants and other natural products may be a source of agents that can potentially alter glycosaminoglycan and proteoglycan formation in animal cells.

Glycosylation inhibitors provide powerful tools for understanding the biosynthesis and biological functions of glycoconjugates in animal cells. Toward that end, a number of substrate analogs for the glycosyltransferases have been synthesized and shown to act as specific inhibitors in vitro (1Hindsgaul O. Kaur K.J. Srivastava G.

Unfortunately, most of these compounds tend to lack activity in live cells, presumably because their hydrophilicity limits their access to the Golgi compartments where the glycosyltransferases reside. A second class of inhibitors, plant alkaloids, act both in vitro and in vivo to inhibit the processing glycosidases required for Asn-linked oligosaccharide formation on glycoproteins (8Elbein A.D.

Analogs of the alkaloids also can inactivate glycosyltransferases (10Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol.

A third class of inhibitors act by diverting the synthesis of oligosaccharides from endogenous glycoconjugates to artificial acceptors (primers).

These simple compounds resemble natural biosynthetic intermediates and therefore trick cells into assembling oligosaccharide chains on the exogenous primer instead of on endogenous substrates. Glycoside-treated cells secrete large amounts of primed oligosaccharides, and accumulate glycoproteins and proteoglycans with truncated glycans. Primers also serve as starting points for making analogs that might have inhibitory activity without acting as a primer. Analogs of simple monosaccharides have been made and tested in cells with some success, but their mode of inhibition is unclear (47Thomas S.S. Plenkiewicz J. Ison E.R. Bols M. Zou W. Szarek W.A.

The derivation of primers and inhibitors by directed synthesis is tedious and requires a certain amount of serendipity to find active compounds. An alternative discovery strategy consists of screening random chemical libraries. The success of this approach depends on rapid, high throughput screening assays to detect potential inhibitors in crude mixtures from microbial or plant sources or from large combinatorial libraries of synthetic compounds. In the studies reported here, we took advantage of the enormous diversity of compounds elaborated by plants to find compounds that alter glycosaminoglycan synthesis in cultured animal cells. Five different plants from a random plant collection were discovered to prime glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. The active principles have been purified and characterized as xylosides of methylated ellagic acid. The discovery of primers in plants suggests possible roles for these compounds in chemical defense and ethnobotany, and that large scale screenings might yield other kinds of primers that affect glycosylation.

Approximately 250 plants were collected from the Amazon rain forest near Iquitos, Peru, as part of a general collection from the area in June, 1993. Voucher specimens have been deposited in the herbarium at the Institute for Botanical Exploration at Mississippi State University. Plant parts (bark, twigs, leaves, flowers, or combinations thereof) were air-dried (40–50 °C) and extracted in the following manner. The dried plant material was dampened with methanol/water (3:2, v/v) and stirred for 3 h at 37–40 °C with enough hexane to achieve a thorough suspension. After vacuum filtration, the residue was sequentially extracted in the same manner with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v), ethyl acetate, and 95% ethanol. Each filtrate was dried by rotary evaporation and lyophilization, and test samples were dissolved at ∼100 mg/ml (w/v) in dimethyl sulfoxide. An aliquot of each extract was added to low sulfate growth medium to a final concentration of ∼1 mg/ml (w/v, final Me2SO concentration, 1%, v/v). A serial dilution series (1:3, v/v) was then prepared down the rows of a 96-well plate using low sulfate growth medium as diluent. To screen for inhibitors, microtiter plates (96-well) were seeded with 1 × 104 wild-type cells/well in 0.2 ml of growth medium and incubated at 37 °C. The next day, the medium was aspirated and 0.1 ml from each well of the 96-well dilution tray prepared above was transferred to the corresponding wells in the plate with cells. Two days later, 20 μl of low sulfate medium containing 5 μCi of35SO4 was added to each well in order to measure glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. After 5 h, the contents of each well were adjusted to 0.1 m NaOH and 100 μl of a stopping solution containing 0.4 m acetic acid, 0.4% Zwittergent 3–12, 20 mm sodium sulfate, and 50 μg/ml chondroitin sulfate was added. To screen for primers, plates were seeded with mutant pgsA-745 cells (deficient in xylosyltransferase, the first enzyme involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis) and incubated until the wells were nearly confluent. Extracts and 35SO4 were added, and 18 h later the wells were treated with NaOH and the stopping solution described above. GeneScreen Plus (NEN Life Science Products) membranes were cut to fit a 96-well vacuum Minifold apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were soaked sequentially in 1 m acetic acid, 1m sodium acetate, and water before use, and placed wet on top of a supporting piece of Whatman 1Chr paper in the apparatus. Samples of solubilized cells and medium were applied under slight vacuum, and the samples were washed with a solution containing 0.2% Zwittergent 3–12, 0.2 m acetic acid, and 10 mmsodium sulfate. The membrane was removed from the Minifold and swirled for 5 min in fresh solution, and then in water. The membranes were air-dried, mounted on paper, and exposed to Kodak X-AR5 film for 1–2 h. In pilot experiments, we found that varying the concentration of acetic acid from 0.1 to 1 m had no effect on binding of purified [35S]glycosaminoglycans, but the addition of 0.1–1 m NaCl markedly reduced recovery from ∼50% to <3%. Adding 10 mm sodium sulfate had no effect, but reduced the background due to inorganic 35SO4. Varying the concentration of detergent from 0.01% to 1%, or substituting Triton X-100 or Tween 20 for Zwittergent 3–12 did not have an effect. To test if the extracts inhibited cell growth, a duplicate plate was seeded with cells and incubated for 2 days with plant samples. The medium was decanted and the wells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were fixed with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, washed with 2% trichloroacetic acid, and stained for 30 min with 0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in water/methanol/acetic acid (45/45/10, v/v). The wells were destained in fresh solvent, rinsed with water, and air-dried. Inhibition of cell growth was judged visually by the staining intensity. The whole plant ofMaieta guianensis was ground (2.6 kg), moistened with 60% (v/v) methanol in water (1 liter) for 1 h, and then extracted at 40 °C in turn with hexane (4 liter), 50% (v/v) hexane-ethyl acetate (4 liter), ethyl acetate (4 liter), and ethanol (4 liter) for 4 h each. After removal of solvents by rotary evaporation at 40 °C, the residues were tested for priming activity. The active ethyl acetate extract (∼20 g) was fractionated over silica gel (140 g, Merck Kieselgel 60, 200–400-mesh) using CH2Cl2/MeOH (1:0 to 0:1) as a stepwise gradient. A total of 10 fractions (0.5 liter each) were collected. The two active fractions, A (CH2Cl2/MeOH (9:1), 2.0 g) and B (CH2Cl2/MeOH (8:2), 6.6 g) were separately passed through Sep-pak Vac C18 cartridges (Waters, 10 g) using H2O/CH3CN (1:0 to 0:1) as a solvent. Activity in fraction A eluted from the Sep-pak separation (H2O/CH3CN (7:3), 0.200 g) and was further purified by reverse-phase HPLC (TosoHaas ODS 80-TM (21.5 mm (inner diameter) × 30 cm) using H2O/CH3CN as a solvent, yielding ellagic acid-4-O-β- xyloside-3,3′-dimethyl ether-3“-O-gallate (2,0.005 g). Ellagic acid 3,3′-dimethyl ether (0.05 g) was found in the H2O/CH3CN (70:30 and 60:40) fraction. Purification of B (3.2 g) on PR-18 Sep-pak using H2O/CH3CN (1:0 to 0:1) yielded gallic acid (0.1 g) from the H2O/CH3CN (9:1) fraction and quercitrin (0.05 g) and ellagic acid xyloside-4-O-β-xyloside-3,3′-dimethyl ether (1,0.010 g) from the H2O/CH3CN (70:30) fraction. Fractions were collected and monitored for priming activity using the membrane assay described above, and active fractions were pooled and rechromatographed as necessary. TLC (Merck Kieselgel 60 F254) was carried out with the lower phase of a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water (65/35/10, v/v). The chromatograms were visualized at 254 and 366 nm or sprayed with anisaldehyde and then heated. FAB-MS were recorded in the negative and positive mode with a VG ZAB-2SE instrument; matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectra were measured on a Kratos KOMPACT instrument;1H, 13C, and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation NMR were obtained in CD3OD and CDCl3 on Bruker 400 AMX, 500 AMX, and 600 DRX spectrometers. The chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to that of tetramethylsilane (δ = 0) as an internal standard, and coupling constants are given in Hz. The structures of dimethylellagic acid, quercitrin, and ellagic acid-4-O-β-xyloside-3,3′-dimethyl ether were determined by comparison with known compounds (53Castenada P. Bahena A. Garcia E.

A portion of compound 2 (ellagic acid-4-O-β-xylopyranoside-3,3′-dimethyl ether-3“-O-gallate, 4 mg) was acetylated with acetic anhydride/pyridine (0.2 ml/0.5 ml, 24 h, room temperature) and the reaction mixture was worked up as usual. The product was purified by hexane/ethyl acetate (1:4, v/v) to a colorless white residue (3 mg); mass spectrum: m/z 889 (M + Na), m/z 867 (M + H) calculated for C40H34O22;13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3): δ 169.74, 169.37, 167.71, 166.39, 163.04, 158.0, 157.75, 155.0, 152.0, 144.9, 144.75, 143.6, 139.69, 126.93, 122.74, 120.29, 117.36, 116.08, 113.24, 112.28, 98.23, 69.42, 68.79, 67.23, 62.18, 62.00, 61.13, 21.00, 20.84, 20.73, 20.59, and 20.21. Approximately 1 × 104 pgsA-745 cells were seeded into 24-well plates in growth medium supplemented with plant extract or purified compound. After 2 days, 50 μCi/ml of 35SO4 (25–40 Ci/mg, NEN Life Science Products) was added. Sixteen hours later, the [35S]glycosaminoglycans were isolated from cells and spent medium by anion-exchange chromatography as described previously (56Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were precipitated from ethanol, and the final pellets were dried by lyophilization, resuspended, and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Portions were analyzed by anion exchange HPLC and by enzymatic digestion with chondroitinase ABC (56Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify novel compounds that modulate proteoglycan biosynthesis, we developed a rapid, high throughput assay to screen large collections of natural and synthetic compounds. Many methods for measuring proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans chemically and radiochemically have been described based on binding to anion exchange resins or on precipitation with cetylpyridinium chloride or ethanol (57Rodén L. Baker J.R. Cifonelli J.A. Mathews M.B. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 73-140Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These techniques depend on the high negative charge of the glycosaminoglycan chains (sulfate and carboxyl groups) or their relative insolubility in an organic solvent. In general, the application of these techniques to multiple samples is rather tedious. To simplify the processing of many samples, we took advantage of the binding properties of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans to cationic membranes routinely used for Southern and Northern blotting of nucleic acids (58Heimer R. Sampson P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 59Rapraeger A. Yeaman C. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, the screening method involves culturing Chinese hamster ovary cells in 96-well dishes, labeling newly made proteoglycans with 35SO4 in the presence of potential agonists or antagonists, and collection of35S-labeled proteoglycans on cationic membranes. A vacuum manifold set-up facilitated the collection process, and autoradiography allowed semiquantitative detection of 35SO4incorporated into the highly charged proteoglycans (see “Experimental Procedures”). Pilot experiments comparing a mutant CHO line defective in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis (pgsA-745) to the wild-type showed that over 90% of the bound radioactive material consisted of proteoglycans or glycosaminoglycans (compare samples in thebottom row of Fig. 1). To find compounds that modulate proteoglycan formation, wild-type CHO cells were grown in 96-well dishes in the presence of crude extracts from terrestrial plants. Our initial studies focused on plant-derived compounds, as plants are known to produce a variety of organic compounds as part of chemical defense against insects and herbivores. All of the plants were collected from flowering species in the Amazon rain forest near Iquitos, Peru. In general, several kilograms of roots, bark, stems, or leaves were collected, dried, and small samples (∼50 g) were sequentially extracted with solvents of varying polarity (see “Experimental Procedures”). The individual extracts were dried, dissolved in Me2SO and tested for activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). Some extracts caused a decrease in35SO4 incorporation, as measured by loss of signal on the autoradiogram compared with wild-type cells incubated in the absence of extract (compare extract 12.4 to the control in Fig. 1). A comparison of the autoradiogram and the staining intensity of a duplicate plate treated with Coomassie Blue showed that the loss of signal was generally associated with a decrease in cell number, indicating that the plant extract was cytotoxic. To date, all potential “inhibitors” discovered in this way exhibited cytotoxicity. 2Under normal conditions, CHO cells produce a mixture of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, but the cells do not depend on proteoglycans or glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis for cell division (45Sarkar A.K. Rostand K.S. Jain R.K. Matta K.L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25608-25616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibitors that affect enzymes involved in proteoglycan assembly should not alter the growth of the cells. Occasionally, we found extracts that appeared to stimulate the incorporation of 35SO4 (Fig. 1, sample 13.2). Interestingly, many of these extracts also restored35SO4 incorporation in a proteoglycan-deficient CHO cell mutant, designated pgsA-745 (50Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This mutant cannot transfer xylose from UDP-xylose to serines on proteoglycan core proteins due to a lesion in xylosyltransferase, the enzyme that initiates glycosaminoglycan chain synthesis. Thus, sample 13.2 bypasses the mutation and restores glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. To date, five plants have been discovered that contain bypassing activity (Psittacanthus cucullaris, M. guianensis, Alchornea triplinervia, Miconia myriantha, and Vismia angusta). The priming activity of four solvent fractions from three of these plants is shown in Fig. 2. In general, the ability of the extracts to restore sulfate incorporation in the mutant was dose-dependent. The ethyl acetate fractions gave the highest activity in all five active plant species, which indicated that the active compounds were rather polar. In P. cucullaris, priming activity was seen in the hexanes/ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and ethanol fractions, suggesting that a range of active compounds varying in polarity may exist. Extraction of fresh plant material yielded similar results to that shown in Fig. 2. A second collection of each plant, made at a different time of the year, yielded nearly identical results (data not shown). The first sample submitted for further fractionation and chemical analysis was the ethyl acetate fraction of M. guianensis. A large scale extraction of material was done (∼2.6 kg dry weight of stems, leaves, and roots), and bioassay-directed, gross fractionation over silica gel followed by reversed phase chromatography afforded two compounds, 1 and 2 (Fig.3). The structure of 1 was found to be dimethyl ellagic acid xyloside by comparison to previously published spectroscopic data (53Castenada P. Bahena A. Garcia E. Chávez O. Mata R.J. J. Nat. Prod. 1993; 56: 1575-1579Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 54Pakulski G. Budzianowski J. Phytochemistry. 1996; 41: 775-778Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 55Zhong X.-N. Otsuka H. Ide T. Hirata E. Takushi A. Takeda Y. Phytochemistry. 1997; 46: 943-946Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Compound 2 was the galloylated dimethyl ellagic acid xyloside on the basis of following analyses. Its molecular formula was C28H22O16 based on its molecular ion at m/z 613 (M − H)− in its negative FAB-MS spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum showed the presence of one galloyl group by two proton singlets at δ 6.98, an ellagic acid moiety by the signals at δ 7.74 and 7.45 (s, 1H each), and six hydrogens of the xylose at δ 5.10 (d, J = 5.8 Hz, 1H anomeric), 4.94 (t, J = 7.3 Hz, 1H), 3.98 (dd,J = 11 and 5 Hz, 1H) and 3.75–3.40 (m, 3H). The sugar was identified as β-d-xylose from the coupling constant of the anomeric hydrogen and by Dionex chromatography of the acid hydrolyzed product. The 1H NMR of 2 also revealed the presence of two aromatic methoxy group at δ 4.04 and 3.92 (s, 3H each) (Fig. 4).Figure 4. 1H NMR spectra for compounds 1 (dimethyl ellagic acid xyloside) and 2 (dimethyl ellagic acid) fromM. guianensis.
