https://openalex.org/W2084858807,"RECENTLY, Sohonie and Ambe1 have reported the preparation of crystalline inhibitors of trypsin from field-bean and double-bean. Unlike these inhibitors, which are comparatively stable to heat treatment, the acid extracts of potato (Solanum tuberosum) have been found to contain a thermolabile inhibitor2. We have now examined the possibility of preparing this inhibitor in quantity in a crystalline form."

https://openalex.org/W1972439827,"THE deoxyribonucleic acid content of nuclei of different species of animals has been listed1; there appears to be a fairly regular increase from the sponges to the mammals. In the sponges the amount is about 0.1 × 10−12 gm. per diploid nucleus, in mammals it is about 6.0 × 10−12 gm. In birds the amount is only a little more than a third of that found in mammals, being about 2.3 × 10−12 gm. As pointed out by White2, there is a distinct break in the distribution of chromosome numbers of the mammals, the Eutherian mammals with few exceptions having a haploid number of the order of 20–30, the marsupials of the order of 6–12. The birds and monotremes both have considerably larger numbers, and resemble the reptiles in this respect. There are, then, at least two major characters by which the higher vertebrates differ: first, the deoxyribonucleic acid content of the nucleus, and secondly, the number of chromosomes. The two do not necessarily parallel one another; but there seems to be a tendency for the groups with many chromosomes to have less deoxyribonucleic acid. The deoxyribonucleic acid content of marsupial nuclei has not heretofore been measured, and investigations of this group are reported here."

https://openalex.org/W1976482730,"THE high in vitro activity of 1-iso nicotinoyl-2-veratrylidene hydrazine (0.06 µgm. per ml.), henceforth referred to as verazide, has been previously reported by us1 and others2,3. Fox and Gibas4 report that 2 : 2-alkylidene derivatives of isoniazid (among which was included verazide) were markedly tuber-culostatic in mouse tuberculosis. There is no refer-ence, however, to the degree of activity of verazide or to its activity when given by intermittent dosage."
