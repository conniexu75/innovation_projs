https://openalex.org/W2055145190,"A simple mathematical model, based on the hypothesis that the psychological process underlying behavior is additive, was applied to the data of an experiment on the formation of personality impressions. Of 12 subjects, only three made responses which deviated by statistically significant amounts from responses predicted from the additive model, and these discrepancies were relatively small."

https://openalex.org/W2087222565,"Tritiated-polyuridylie acid was degraded rapidly in extracts of Escherichia coli and degradation was not dependent on concomitant polyphenylalanine synthesis. Since a large portion of the polymer was degraded before appreciable polyphenylalanine was synthesized, the catalytic activity of the undegraded polyuridylic acid in directing protein synthesis was suggested. The predominant breakdown products were 5'-mononucleotide phosphates. Possible enzymatic routes of polyuridylic acid breakdown are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2095586869,"Electrical stimulation of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus caused hungry rats to stop eating. However, control tests showed such stimulation to be potentially noxious and capable of stopping drinking in thirsty rats. Thus the stopping of eating caused by this stimulation may not have been indicative of a primary effect on hunger."
https://openalex.org/W1983186211,"Tritiated-poly U, when added to cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli, became associated with ribosomes. This association occurred at 3Â°C and did not require high-energy phosphate compounds. Small amounts of tritiated polyuridylic acid produced polydisperse ribosomal aggregates with sedimentation constants of approximately 100 to 130. C14-phenylalanine initially was incorporated into protein only on these particles, which suggests that they are the sites of polyphenylalanine synthesis."

Compared with control cells, the tetracycline-treated cells had no transvers septa, were larger, had a greater electron density, and had thicker cell walls."
https://openalex.org/W2030364869,"Correlations between the heights of children throughout their development and their parents's mature heights differ widely in different growth studies. The range of values, however, is shown to be within the limits of sampling error, making it possible to estimate correlations for each age from birth to maturity. Mother-child correlations are generally higher than father-child correlations, and for both comparisons the correlation increases when the child reaches early adolescence. There is no relation between the heights of the parents and the timing of the child's growth spurt, but there probably is a relation between the heights of the parents and the amount the child grows during early adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2012331857,"In an area in Brazil where schistosomiasis has long been endemic, examination of cattle which were slaughtered for food disclosed the presence of adult Schistosoma mansoni in the mesenteric veins of four animals. Eggs of S. mansoni were found in the feces and rectal mucosa of one animal."
https://openalex.org/W2143053114,"When the corneal epithelium of the Chinese hamster is irradiated with ionizing radiation in vivo, a rectilinear relationship is observed between the yield of chromosome aberrations and the dose of x-rays within a dose range of 10 to 150 r. There is no threshold effect for chromosome breakage down to the 10-r level. The mean breakage rate of 0.00352 breaks per cell per roentgen is in very close agreement with the data obtained on other mammalian tissues, both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1986989228,"Imidazole, at concentrations of 0.05M to 0.2M, has been found to increase the rate of deuterium-hydrogen exchange in a model amide by 40-fold or more. Since imidazole side-chains occur in proteins, deuterium exchange in these macromolecules may be strongly affected by the presence of these or similar activating groups."
https://openalex.org/W2033494562,"Although normal hydras resist the uptake of tritiated thymidine into thei tissues, regenerating forms contain a very heavy label in interstitial cells, epithelio- muscular cells, and digestive cells of the gastrodermis if the animals are allowed to regenerate in a medium containing the isotope. Preliminary results suggest that during early regeneration active wound repair is not effected by interstitial cells which divide and then begin to differentiate, but through differentiation of interstitial cells which are nondividing or which have partially begun to differentiate. Dividing interstitial cells probably function to restore the animal's original embryonic reserve."

https://openalex.org/W2051645712,"Geologic reconnaissance indicates that the Ellsworth Mountains consist mainly of thousands of feet of folded, slightly metamorphosed, clastic sedimentary rocks of unknown age. Three major stratigraphic units are recognized, but only fragmentary fossils have been found. The folding is asymmetric, overturned, or recumbent; fold axes strike north, 10 degrees to 20 degrees west. Basic igneous sills occur in the northern Heritage Range."
https://openalex.org/W1981164812,"Particle-free media in which pure cultures of the green alga Chlamydomonas moewusii have been growing are yellow. In its solubility, chromatographic behavior, fluorescence, response to changes of pH, and optical absorption, the coloring matter closely resembles mixtures of substances previously held responsible for the yellow color of some pond waters. Our findings suggest that the yellow materials of natural waters may originate from algal metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2048053631,"The inhibition by iodine of the atmosphere photochemical reaction of olefin with nitrogen dioxide has been confirmed. The presence of iodine in concentrations comparable to those of the reactants retards the formation of aldehyde, peroxyacetyl nitrate, and aerosol as well as the disappearance of olefin. The reaction of iodine with atomic oxygen may account for this inhibition. A number of other potential inhibitors were found to be ineffective."

This report describes a gamma-ray spectrometric study of fallout activity as a function of depth of soil. Total gamma activity deposited from recent tests was found to be over 1.5 curies per square mile at a site in eastern Indiana during July, 1962."

A Univac computer was used to demonstrate a functional attribute of ceramics, and sociological inferences were made from spatial distributions of pottery designs."
