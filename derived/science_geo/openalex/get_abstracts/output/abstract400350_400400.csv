The objective of this analysis was to examine trends in occupational physical activity during the past 5 decades and explore how these trends relate to concurrent changes in body weight in the U.S.Analysis of energy expenditure for occupations in U.S. private industry since 1960 using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mean body weight was derived from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). In the early 1960's almost half the jobs in private industry in the U.S. required at least moderate intensity physical activity whereas now less than 20% demand this level of energy expenditure. Since 1960 the estimated mean daily energy expenditure due to work related physical activity has dropped by more than 100 calories in both women and men. Energy balance model predicted weights based on change in occupation-related daily energy expenditure since 1960 for each NHANES examination period closely matched the actual change in weight for 40-50 year old men and women. For example from 1960-62 to 2003-06 we estimated that the occupation-related daily energy expenditure decreased by 142 calories in men. Given a baseline weight of 76.9 kg in 1960-02, we estimated that a 142 calories reduction would result in an increase in mean weight to 89.7 kg, which closely matched the mean NHANES weight of 91.8 kg in 2003-06. The results were similar for women.Over the last 50 years in the U.S. we estimate that daily occupation-related energy expenditure has decreased by more than 100 calories, and this reduction in energy expenditure accounts for a significant portion of the increase in mean U.S. body weights for women and men."
https://openalex.org/W2035838778,"Maintaining physical connections between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton is important for many cellular processes that require coordinated movement and positioning of the nucleus. Nucleo-cytoskeletal coupling is also necessary to transmit extracellular mechanical stimuli across the cytoskeleton to the nucleus, where they may initiate mechanotransduction events. The LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, formed by the interaction of nesprins and SUN proteins at the nuclear envelope, can bind to nuclear and cytoskeletal elements; however, its functional importance in transmitting intracellular forces has never been directly tested. This question is particularly relevant since recent findings have linked nesprin mutations to muscular dystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Using biophysical assays to assess intracellular force transmission and associated cellular functions, we identified the LINC complex as a critical component for nucleo-cytoskeletal force transmission. Disruption of the LINC complex caused impaired propagation of intracellular forces and disturbed organization of the perinuclear actin and intermediate filament networks. Although mechanically induced activation of mechanosensitive genes was normal (suggesting that nuclear deformation is not required for mechanotransduction signaling) cells exhibited other severe functional defects after LINC complex disruption; nuclear positioning and cell polarization were impaired in migrating cells and in cells plated on micropatterned substrates, and cell migration speed and persistence time were significantly reduced. Taken together, our findings suggest that the LINC complex is critical for nucleo-cytoskeletal force transmission and that LINC complex disruption can result in defects in cellular structure and function that may contribute to the development of muscular dystrophies and cardiomyopathies.

A stable connection between the nucleus and cytoskeleton is required for a wide range of physiological functions such as cell migration or nuclear positioning. Two recently discovered major molecular components involved in nucleo-cytoskeletal coupling are nesprin and SUN proteins, nuclear envelope transmembrane protein families that form a bridge across the nuclear envelope. SUN1 and SUN2 are retained at the inner nuclear membrane by their interaction with lamins, nuclear pore complex proteins, and the nuclear interior, whereas their conserved C-terminal SUN domain extends into the perinuclear space (1Crisp M.

Here, they interact with the highly conserved C-terminal KASH domain of nesprins located at the nuclear envelope. Four nesprin genes have been identified to date, many of them containing diverse isoforms as a result of alternate initiation and splicing sites. The largest isoforms of nesprins-1 and -2 contain an N-terminal actin-binding domain, enabling them to interact with cytoplasmic actin filaments (4Padmakumar V.C. Abraham S. Braune S. Noegel A.A.

Through spectrin-repeat-mediated interactions with kinesin and/or dynein subunits, nesprins-1 and -2 can also connect to microtubules (6Wilhelmsen K. Litjens S.H. Kuikman I. Tshimbalanga N.

Thus, SUN proteins and nesprins can form a physical connection between the nuclear interior and the cytoskeleton that is referred to as the LINC 2The abbreviations used are: LINClinker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complexMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastsDNdominant negativeERendoplasmic reticulum. complex (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton)(1Crisp M.

Previous studies suggest that the LINC complex could be well suited to transmit forces between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton; however, it remains to be determined if the interaction between SUN and nesprin proteins is essential for intracellular force transmission in mammalian cells or if other nuclear envelope proteins are sufficient to carry out this function. This question is particularly relevant in light of recent reports that nesprin mutations can give rise to a variety of diseases, including Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and some forms of dilated cardiomyopathy (7Zhang Q.

Therefore, we decided to explore whether LINC complex disruption by functional loss of nesprins (or SUN proteins) could also result in disturbed intracellular force transmission and modulate critical cellular functions. We applied custom-developed biophysical assays to assess intracellular force transmission and related cellular functions in cells after disruption of the LINC complex by dominant negative nesprin and SUN protein constructs. LINC complex disruption resulted in defects in cell polarization and migration, disturbed cytoskeletal organization, and impaired force transmission between the cytoskeleton and the nuclear interior. Our data provide direct evidence for a critical role of the LINC complex in nucleo-cytoskeletal force transmission and suggest that mutations that disrupt the LINC complex could have severe effects on intracellular force transmission and cytoskeleton-mediated cellular functions, thereby contributing to the development of muscular dystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Aleken Biologicals), and 5% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma); primary human skin fibroblasts (HG090; Progeria Research Foundation) were grown in Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium (Lonza) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Aleken Biologicals), 5% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), and 5% l-glutamine (Invitrogen). To generate DN KASH fluorescently labeled with an N-terminal mCherry domain, mCherry was amplified from pCDH-EF1-MCS1-puro-mCherry (kindly provided by Dr. P. Patwari (10Patwari P. Chutkow W.A.

The KASH domain from GFP-mouse nesprin-1α (11Zhang Q. Skepper J.N. Yang F. Davies J.D. Hegyi L. Roberts R.G. Weissberg P.L. Ellis J.A. Shanahan C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4485-4498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR (see supplemental data for primer sequences) and inserted downstream of the mCherry sequence into the mCherry- pcDNA4/His-Max plasmid. mCherry-Nesprin-1αKASH was subcloned from pcDNA4/His-Max mCherry-Nesprin-1αKASH, into pCDH-EF1-MCS1-puro vector (System Biosciences) to create pCDH-EF1-MCS1-puro-mCherry-Nesprin-1αKASH. The resulting plasmid is referred to as DN KASH in this work. As a mock control (mCherry alone), pCDH-EF1-MCS1-puro-mCherry was used and is referred to as mCherry control in this manuscript. As an additional control, EGFP-nesprin-2αext was used. This construct, based on wild-type nesprin-2α, has a modified KASH domain containing additional C-terminal amino acids from the expression vector. It correctly localizes to the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum but cannot interact with SUN proteins in the perinuclear space (12Stewart-Hutchinson P.J. Hale C.M. Wirtz D. Hodzic D. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1892-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We also performed experiments with a modified form of nesprin-2 giant (which is too large for ectopic expression), referred to as mini-nesprin-2G. This GFP-tagged chimeric construct, kindly provided by Dr. Gundersen's laboratory (13Ostlund C. Folker E.S. Choi J.C. Gomes E.R. Gundersen G.G. Worman H.J. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 4099-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), consists of the N-terminal actin-binding domain with two adjacent spectrin repeats fused to the C-terminal KASH domain with two spectrin repeats preceding it, and was recently shown to rescue nuclear positioning in nesprin-depleted cells (14Luxton G.W. Gomes E.R. Folker E.S. Vintinner E. Gundersen G.G. Science. 2010; 329: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The DN KASH construct was overexpressed in MEFs and HG090 primary human skin fibroblasts by transduction with a vector based on replication-deficient human immunodeficiency virus. Lentiviral particles were produced by cotransfecting the DN KASH or mCherry control plasmids with packaging gag-pol and VSVG-envelope plasmids 2.5:1:1 ratio into 293TN cells (ATCC) using Lipofectin transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Virus-containing medium was collected 2–7 days after transfection, spun at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, 0.45-μm filtered, and applied to ∼1 × 105 cells plated the previous day. Cells were transduced with the virus every 10 h, for 30 h to increase the percentage of gene-modified cells. Experiments were performed on cells identified by mCherry expression. Nesprin-2αext and mini-nesprin-2G were transiently transfected into MEFs using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. The 5′-end of SS-HA-Sun1L-KDEL was amplified from pcDNA3.1SS-HA-Sun1L-KDEL (1Crisp M. Liu Q. Roux K. Rattner J.B. Shanahan C. Burke B. Stahl P.D. Hodzic D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) by PCR (see supplemental data for primer sequences). The SS-HA-Sun1L-KDEL sequence was ligated into the pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP-T2A-puro vector (System Biosciences). The resulting plasmid was pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP-T2A-puroSS-HA-Sun1L-KDEL and is referred to as DN SUN1L throughout this work. As a mock control (GFP alone), pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP-T2A-puro was used. As an additional control, we used GFP modified with the SS-KDEL sequence (SS-GFP-KDEL) to recruit the protein to the perinuclear space and endoplasmic reticulum, just as in the DN SUN1L construct. Lastly, we used the expression of GFP-tagged wild-type SUN1 to assess the effect of increased SUN1 expression on nucleo-cytoskeletal coupling. Because stable expression of DN SUN1L for more than a week appeared cytotoxic, resulting in a selection bias toward cells with very low expression levels, we transiently transfected the plasmid into cells using Mirus TransIT-LT1 Transfection reagent MIR 2300 (Mirus Bio Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and conducted experiments 72 h after transfection. At this time point, all cells were viable and proliferated normally. SS-GFP-KDEL and GFP-tagged wild-type SUN1 were transiently transfected into MEFs using Mirus TransIT-LT1 Transfection reagent MIR 2300 (Mirus Bio Corp.) and Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen), respectively, following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown on glass coverslides coated with 0.5 μg/ml fibronectin (Millipore) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, followed by permeabilization for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and then blocked with 5% horse serum for 1 h. Cells were probed with primary rabbit polyclonal antibody against nesprin-3 (kindly provided by Dr. A. Sonnenberg, dilution 1:500), primary rabbit polyclonal antibody against nesprin-2G (kindly provided by Dr. D. Hodzic, dilution 1:1000), primary rabbit polyclonal antibody vimentin (kindly provided by Dr. T. Magin, dilution 1:500), primary mouse monoclonal antibody β-tubulin (E7, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, dilution 1:400), and primary mouse monoclonal antibody HA-tag (HA.11 Clone 16B12, Covance, dilution 1:1000). Cells were stained with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 (dilution 1:200) or Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (dilution 1:50) and Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (dilution 1:1000) (all Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were acquired with 20× (0.4 N.A., Plan-Achromat, Olympus) or 60× oil immersion (1.42 N.A., Plan-Achromat, Olympus) objectives using an Olympus IX-70 microscope with a digital charge-coupled device camera (CoolSNAP EZ, Roper Scientific) using IPLab version 4.0 (Scanalytics) software. Images were analyzed by an observer, blinded by treatment. Cytoskeletal structures were scored as either normal or abnormal. For actin organization, the presence of short actin fragments near the nucleus was considered abnormal. For vimentin organization, a well-defined intermediate filament cage surrounding the nucleus was considered normal while the absence or disruption of the perinuclear cage-like network was considered abnormal. Cells were grown on 0.5 μg/ml fibronectin-coated glass dishes. Thirty minutes prior to the experiments, cells were incubated with MitoTracker Green or Red mitochondrial stain and Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (both Invitrogen), washed and imaged in Hank's Buffered Salt Saline (Invitrogen). Microneedles with tip diameters of 1 to 3 μm were pulled with a pipette puller (Sutter Instrument Company). The microneedle, controlled by an InjectMan NI 2 micromanipulator (Eppendorf), was carefully inserted into the cell 5 μm away from the nuclear periphery and moved 10 μm toward the cell periphery at 1 μm/second while collecting fluorescence (Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 and 350) and phase contrast images every 10 s with a 60× objective (0.70 N.A., Plan-Achromat, Olympus). Displacement maps were computed by tracking fluorescently labeled features of the nucleus and cytoplasm using custom-written MATLAB (MathWorks) algorithms (see “Generation of Displacement Maps and Deformation Measurements” below). Induced nuclear strain was computed by measuring nuclear elongation before and during strain application. To validate fluorescently labeled mitochondria as valid fiducial markers for cytoskeletal displacements, we also conducted experiments on cells transiently expressing GFP- or mCherry-actin (kindly provided by Dr. F. Gertler) and GFP-vimentin (kindly provided by Dr. R. Goldman) and double labeled with MitoTracker Red or Green (Invitrogen) and then correlated the measured displacements. For the microneedle manipulation experiments, displacement maps of nuclear and cytoskeletal deformations were computed using previously developed MATLAB algorithms (15Lammerding J. Huang H. So P.T. Kamm R.D. Lee R.T. IEEE Eng. Med. Biol. Mag. 2003; 22: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The approach is based on normalized cross-correlation between small image regions (∼10 μm × 10 μm in size and spaced 5 μm) in subsequent image frames, which identifies corresponding regions within a larger search area in the two frames. For each region center, the displacement is then computed as the shift between the original location and the newly identified position. Regions with low image intensity or insufficient texture (e.g. regions outside the cell) are excluded from the analysis. A median filter was used to eliminate spurious results that can occur from incorrect matches. Subsequently, for each cell, average displacements within predefined regions corresponding to the strain application site, a region of the nucleus toward the strain application site, a nuclear region away from the application site, and a cytoplasmic region across the nucleus (see Fig. 3A, inset) were computed from the displacement maps. Uniaxial strain experiments were carried out as described previously (16Coffinier C. Jung H.J. Li Z. Nobumori C. Yun U.J. Farber E.A. Davies B.S. Weinstein M.M. Yang S.H. Lammerding J. Farahani J.N.

Briefly, cells were plated on fibronectin-coated silicone membranes in phenol red free DMEM, high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to the strain experiments, the cells were incubated with Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain in phenol red free DMEM for 15 min. Membranes were placed on a custom-made strain device mounted on an Olympus IX-70 microscope, with a 60× objective (0.70 N.A., Plan-Achromat, Olympus). Induced nuclear deformations are analyzed by tracking fluorescently labeled nuclei before, during, and after strain application and normalized to membrane strain to compensate for small variations in the applied membrane strain (∼20%) by using custom written image analysis algorithms. Strain-induced expression of mechanosensitive genes was carried out as described previously (17Lammerding J. Schulze P.C. Takahashi T. Kozlov S. Sullivan T. Kamm R.D. Stewart C.L. Lee R.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on fibronectin-coated silicone membranes. After 48 h of serum starvation, cells were subjected to bi-axial cyclic strain (5% at 1 Hz) for 30 min as previously described (17Lammerding J. Schulze P.C. Takahashi T. Kozlov S. Sullivan T.

Res. 1997; 80: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Chemical stimulation with PMA (200 ng/ml in DMEM for 30 min, Sigma) served as a positive control. RNA from strained and unstrained control cells was isolated using RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen). Gene expression was then quantified by real-time PCR using probes for mechanosensitive genes Egr-1, Iex-1, Pai-I, Tenascin C, Talin, and Vinculin (see supplemental data for primer sequences). Expression was normalized to an endogenous control, TATA binding protein (see supplemental data for primer sequence) and compared with unstrained controls and strained mCherry controls using the ΔΔCt method. A wound was created in serum-starved confluent cell monolayers using a 200 μl-micropipette tip. Subsequently, serum-free medium was replaced with medium containing 3% fetal bovine serum and phase contrast images were acquired at 0 and 3 h post-wound with a 4× objective (0.13 N.A., Plan-Achromat, Olympus). The open wound area was calculated by manually tracing the edge of the wound. Only wounds with an initial width between 53–58 μm were analyzed. For the cell polarization studies, cells were fixed 0 or 3 h post-wounding and probed with primary mouse monoclonal γ-tubulin (Clone GTU-88, Sigma-Aldrich, 2 μg/ml) and secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (dilution 1:200) and Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (dilution 1:1000) to assess centrosome orientation relative to the nucleus and the wound edge as described previously (19Lee J.S.

Cells were imaged with a 40× objective (1.15 N.A., Plan-Achromat, Olympus) as described for the wound healing experiment. Cells were plated on fibronectin-coated micropatterned surfaces with crossbow-shaped cell-adhesive areas (CYTOO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, 12 h after plating. Cells were probed with primary mouse monoclonal γ-tubulin (Clone GTU-88, Sigma-Aldrich, 2 μg/ml) and secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (dilution 1:200) and Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (dilution 1:1000). Cell polarization was evaluated as described previously (19Lee J.S. Hale C.M. Panorchan P. Khatau S.B. George J.P. Tseng Y. Stewart C.L. Hodzic D. Wirtz D.

Cells were imaged with 20× (0.40 N.A., Plan-Achromat, Olympus) or 40× (1.15 N.A., Plan-Achromat, Olympus) objectives. Cells were plated on 0.5 μg/ml fibronectin-coated glass dishes and allowed to adhere for 4 h in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Subsequently, cells maintained on a temperature (37 °C) controlled stage were imaged every 5 min for 6 h with a 20× objective (0.40 N.A., Plan-Achromat, Olympus). Cell speed and persistence were analyzed from traces of the cell nucleus as described previously (20Verstraeten V.L. Ji J.Y. Cummings K.S. Lee R.T. Lammerding J. Aging Cell. 2008; 7: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least three independent times. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with PRISM 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.). The data were analyzed by unpaired t test (for comparison between two groups) or one-way ANOVA. A two-tailed p value below 0.05 was considered significant. To disrupt the interaction between nesprins and SUN proteins at the nuclear envelope, we stably introduced dominant negative nesprin constructs, containing the C-terminal KASH domain fused to an amino-terminal mCherry, into mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human skin fibroblasts. Overexpression of the dominant negative KASH domain (DN KASH) saturates available binding sites at the nuclear envelope by promiscuously binding to endogenous SUN proteins (12Stewart-Hutchinson P.J. Hale C.M. Wirtz D. Hodzic D. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1892-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), resulting in the displacement of endogenous nesprins from the nuclear envelope into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Fig. 1, A, B, E). In a parallel approach, we disrupted the LINC complex by introducing a dominant negative SUN1 luminal domain construct (DN SUN1L) targeted to the perinuclear space, co-expressed with GFP and containing a HA tag, into MEFs (Fig. 1, C and D, S1). Overexpression of the DN SUN1L saturates the nesprin KASH domains in the luminal space and prevents binding to endogenous SUN proteins at the inner nuclear membrane (1Crisp M. Liu Q. Roux K.

Analysis of intracellular localization of nesprins-2 and -3 confirmed that expression of DN KASH and DN SUN1L resulted in the displacement of endogenous nesprins from the nuclear envelope to the ER (Fig. 1, F and G). To determine whether LINC complex disruption affects intracellular force transmission between the nucleus and cytoskeleton, we developed a microneedle manipulation assay that applies precisely controlled cytoskeletal strain at a defined distance from the nucleus with a computer-controlled microneedle while simultaneously imaging induced nuclear and cytoskeletal deformations across the cell (Fig. 2, A and B and supplemental Movie S1), thereby advancing an earlier approach pioneered by Maniotis et al.

Cytoskeletal and nuclear displacements were measured by tracking fluorescently labeled mitochondria and plotted as displacement vector maps (Fig. 2, C–E). Experiments on cells double-labeled with Mitotracker Red or Green and GFP- or mCherry-actin and GFP-vimentin confirmed that mitochondria can serve as reliable fiducial markers for deformations of the actin and vimentin cytoskeleton (Fig. 2, F and G, respectively). Cytoskeletal and nuclear displacements were quantified in selected areas at increasing distances from the strain application site (Fig. 3A, areas corresponding to the colored boxes in inset). Despite comparable cytoskeletal strain application at the microneedle insertion site (orange box), induced nuclear and cytoskeletal displacements (blue, yellow, and red boxes) at other regions were significantly smaller in the DN KASH expressing MEFs than in control cells expressing mCherry alone and in non-modified cells (Fig. 3A and supplemental Movies S2 and S3), indicating that the force transmission betw"

We sought to assess the orthology between C. elegans and human genes to understand better the relationship between their genomes and to generate a compelling list of candidates to streamline RNAi-based screens in this model. Results We performed a meta-analysis of results from four orthology prediction programs and generated a compendium, “OrthoList”, containing 7,663 C. elegans protein-coding genes. Various assessments indicate that OrthoList has extensive coverage with low false-positive and false-negative rates. Part of this evaluation examined the conservation of components of the receptor tyrosine kinase, Notch, Wnt, TGF-ß and insulin signaling pathways, and led us to update compendia of conserved C. elegans kinases, nuclear hormone receptors, F-box proteins, and transcription factors. Comparison with two published genome-wide RNAi screens indicated that virtually all of the conserved hits would have been obtained had just the OrthoList set (∼38% of the genome) been targeted. We compiled Ortholist by InterPro domains and Gene Ontology annotation, making it easy to identify C. elegans orthologs of human disease genes for potential functional analysis. Conclusions We anticipate that OrthoList will be of considerable utility to C. elegans researchers for streamlining RNAi screens, by focusing on genes with apparent human orthologs, thus reducing screening effort by ∼60%. Moreover, we find that OrthoList provides a useful basis for annotating orthology and reveals more C. elegans orthologs of human genes in various functional groups, such as transcription factors, than previously described."
https://openalex.org/W1985800268,"We evaluated the mechanism of capsaicin-mediated ROS generation in pancreatic cancer cells. The generation of ROS was about 4–6 fold more as compared to control and as early as 1 h after capsaicin treatment in BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells but not in normal HPDE-6 cells. The generation of ROS was inhibited by catalase and EUK-134. To delineate the mechanism of ROS generation, enzymatic activities of mitochondrial complex-I and complex-III were determined in the pure mitochondria. Our results shows that capsaicin inhibits about 2.5–9% and 5–20% of complex-I activity and 8–75% of complex-III activity in BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells respectively, which was attenuable by SOD, catalase and EUK-134. On the other hand, capsaicin treatment failed to inhibit complex-I or complex-III activities in normal HPDE-6 cells. The ATP levels were drastically suppressed by capsaicin treatment in both BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells and attenuated by catalase or EUK-134. Oxidation of mitochondria-specific cardiolipin was substantially higher in capsaicin treated cells. BxPC-3 derived ρ0 cells, which lack mitochondrial DNA, were completely resistant to capsaicin mediated ROS generation and apoptosis. Our results reveal that the release of cytochrome c and cleavage of both caspase-9 and caspase-3 due to disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential were significantly blocked by catalase and EUK-134 in BxPC-3 cells. Our results further demonstrate that capsaicin treatment not only inhibit the enzymatic activity and expression of SOD, catalase and glutathione peroxidase but also reduce glutathione level. Over-expression of catalase by transient transfection protected the cells from capsaicin-mediated ROS generation and apoptosis. Furthermore, tumors from mice orally fed with 2.5 mg/kg capsaicin show decreased SOD activity and an increase in GSSG/GSH levels as compared to controls. Taken together, our results suggest the involvement of mitochondrial complex-I and III in capsaicin-mediated ROS generation and decrease in antioxidant levels resulting in severe mitochondrial damage leading to apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1965734909,"Background The Radical-Pair-Model postulates that the reception of magnetic compass directions in birds is based on spin-chemical reactions in specialized photopigments in the eye, with cryptochromes discussed as candidate molecules. But so far, the exact subcellular characterization of these molecules in the retina remained unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We here describe the localization of cryptochrome 1a (Cry1a) in the retina of European robins, Erithacus rubecula, and domestic chickens, Gallus gallus, two species that have been shown to use the magnetic field for compass orientation. In both species, Cry1a is present exclusively in the ultraviolet/violet (UV/V) cones that are distributed across the entire retina. Electron microscopy shows Cry1a in ordered bands along the membrane discs of the outer segment, and cell fractionation reveals Cry1a in the membrane fraction, suggesting the possibility that Cry1a is anchored along membranes. Conclusions/Significance We provide first structural evidence that Cry1a occurs within a sensory structure arranged in a way that fulfils essential requirements of the Radical-Pair-Model. Our findings, identifying the UV/V-cones as probable magnetoreceptors, support the assumption that Cry1a is indeed the receptor molecule mediating information on magnetic directions, and thus provide the Radical-Pair-Model with a profound histological background."
https://openalex.org/W1986896721,"Exponential random graph models (ERGMs), also known as p* models, have been utilized extensively in the social science literature to study complex networks and how their global structure depends on underlying structural components. However, the literature on their use in biological networks (especially brain networks) has remained sparse. Descriptive models based on a specific feature of the graph (clustering coefficient, degree distribution, etc.) have dominated connectivity research in neuroscience. Corresponding generative models have been developed to reproduce one of these features. However, the complexity inherent in whole-brain network data necessitates the development and use of tools that allow the systematic exploration of several features simultaneously and how they interact to form the global network architecture. ERGMs provide a statistically principled approach to the assessment of how a set of interacting local brain network features gives rise to the global structure. We illustrate the utility of ERGMs for modeling, analyzing, and simulating complex whole-brain networks with network data from normal subjects. We also provide a foundation for the selection of important local features through the implementation and assessment of three selection approaches: a traditional p-value based backward selection approach, an information criterion approach (AIC), and a graphical goodness of fit (GOF) approach. The graphical GOF approach serves as the best method given the scientific interest in being able to capture and reproduce the structure of fitted brain networks."
https://openalex.org/W2084111533,"The degradation of collagens, the most abundant proteins of the extracellular matrix, is involved in numerous physiological and pathological conditions including cancer invasion. An important turnover pathway involves cellular internalization and degradation of large, soluble collagen fragments, generated by initial cleavage of the insoluble collagen fibers. We have previously observed that in primary mouse fibroblasts, this endocytosis of collagen fragments is dependent on the receptor urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein (uPARAP)/Endo180. Others have identified additional mechanisms of collagen uptake, with different associated receptors, in other cell types. These receptors include β1-integrins, being responsible for collagen phagocytosis, and the mannose receptor. We have now utilized a newly developed monoclonal antibody against uPARAP/Endo180, which down-regulates the receptor protein level on treated cells, to examine the role of uPARAP/Endo180 as a mediator of collagen internalization by a wide range of cultured cell types. With the exception of macrophages, all cells that proved capable of efficient collagen internalization were of mesenchymal origin and all of these utilized uPARAP/Endo180 for their collagen uptake process. Macrophages internalized collagen in a process mediated by the mannose receptor, a protein belonging to the same protein family as uPARAP/Endo180. β1-Integrins were found not to be involved in the endocytosis of soluble collagen, irrespectively of whether this was mediated by uPARAP/Endo180 or the mannose receptor. This further distinguishes these pathways from the phagocytic uptake of particulate collagen."

This study examined whether television viewing time is associated with these three outcomes, independently of physical activity energy expenditure and other confounding variables.A population-based cohort of 12,608 men and women (aged 61.4±9.0), free from stroke, myocardial infarction and cancer at baseline in 1998-2000 were followed up until 2007 (6.9±1.9 years). Participants self-reported education, smoking, alcohol use, antihypertensive, lipid lowering and antidepressant medication, disease history, total energy intake, sleep duration, physical activity and television viewing. BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) were measured by standardized procedures; a clustered metabolic risk score was constructed. Every one hour/day increase in television viewing was associated with an increased hazard for total (HR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.03-1.08; 2,620 cases), non-fatal CVD (HR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.03-1.09; 2,134 cases), and coronary heart disease (HR = 1.08, 95%CI = 1.03-1.13; 940 cases), independent of gender, age, education, smoking, alcohol, medication, diabetes status, CVD family history, sleep duration and physical activity energy expenditure. Energy intake, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, HbA(1c) and the clustered metabolic risk score only partially mediated these associations.These results indicate that the most prevalent leisure time (sedentary) behaviour, television viewing, independently contributes to increased CVD risk. Recommendations on reducing television viewing time should be considered."

Here, different subclasses of flavonoids were screened for their osteogenic properties by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity in cultured rat osteoblasts. The flavone baicalin derived mainly from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis showed the strongest induction of alkaline phosphatase activity. In cultured osteoblasts, application of baicalin increased significantly the osteoblastic mineralization and the levels of mRNAs encoding the bone differentiation markers, including osteonectin, osteocalcin, and collagen type 1α1. Interestingly, the osteogenic effect of baicalin was not mediated by its estrogenic activity. In contrast, baicalin promoted osteoblastic differentiation via the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway; the activation resulted in the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β and, subsequently, induced the nuclear accumulation of the β-catenin, leading to the transcription activation of Wnt-targeted genes for osteogenesis. The baicalin-induced osteogenic effects were fully abolished by DKK-1, a blocker of Wnt/β-catenin receptor. Moreover, baicalin also enhanced the mRNA expression of osteoprotegerin, which could regulate indirectly the activation of osteoclasts. Taken together, our results suggested that baicalin could act via Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote osteoblastic differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W1984867989,"Most organisms modulate their reproductive activity responding to day length by the nocturnal release of melatonin by the pineal gland. This hormone is also responsible for synchronizing reproduction with specific external environment stimuli in order to optimize reproductive success. The aim of this study was to establish the effect of melatonin on zebrafish reproduction. Adult females were daily exposed, via water, to two different doses (100 nM and 1 µM) of melatonin. Melatonin led to an increase of the Gonado Somatic Index (GSI) associated with the increase of eggs production, and the raise of gene and protein levels of vitellogenin (VTG) and estradiol receptor α (ERα) in the liver. The ability of melatonin to increase fecundity was consistent with a significant increase of gene transcription of kiss 1, kiss 2, gnrh3, in the brain, and lh in the pituitary, while in the ovary (in class IIIB follicles), with a significant decrease of two genes codifying for intra-ovarian regulators of premature oocyte maturation, the tgfβ1 and the bmp15. The reduction in the expression of these two genes was concomitant with the increase of lhr and a modulation of mprα and mprβ gene transcription, whose proteins are involved in oocyte maturation. Melatonin also exerted a direct action on follicles as shown by the increase of the oocytes undergoing to germinal vesicle break down (GVBD) and modulated mpr α and β gene expression in the in vitro exposure. These data highlight the effects of melatonin in promoting zebrafish reproduction exerting its effects either in the brain-pituitary and in the gonads."
https://openalex.org/W2031322356,"The developing zebrafish embryo has been the subject of many studies of regional patterning, stereotypical cell movements and changes in cell shape. To better study the morphological features of cells during gastrulation, we generated mosaic embryos expressing membrane attached Dendra2 to highlight cellular boundaries. We find that intercellular bridges join a significant fraction of epiblast cells in the zebrafish embryo, reaching several cell diameters in length and spanning across different regions of the developing embryos. These intercellular bridges are distinct from the cellular protrusions previously reported as extending from hypoblast cells (1-2 cellular diameters in length) or epiblast cells (which were shorter). Most of the intercellular bridges were formed at pre-gastrula stages by the daughters of a dividing cell maintaining a membrane tether as they move apart after mitosis. These intercellular bridges persist during gastrulation and can mediate the transfer of proteins between distant cells. These findings reveal a surprising feature of the cellular landscape in zebrafish embryos and open new possibilities for cell-cell communication during gastrulation, with implications for modeling, cellular mechanics, and morphogenetic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2092293417,"Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) is the amyloid component of senile plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. Recently a soluble oliomeric form of Aβ in Aβ precursor protein transgenic mouse brains and AD brains was identified as a potential causative molecule for memory impairment, suggesting that soluble Aβ oligomers cause neurodegeneration in AD. Further characterization of this species has been hampered, however, because the concentrations are quite small and it is difficult to monitor Aβ oligomers specifically. Here we developed a novel method for monitoring Aβ oligomers using a split-luciferase complementation assay. In this assay, the N- and C-terminal fragments of Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) are fused separately to Aβ. We found that conditioned media from both N- and C-terminal fragments of Gluc-tagged Aβ1-42 doubly transfected HEK293 cells showed strong luminescence. We used gel filtration analyses to analyze the size of oligomers formed by the luciferase complementation assay, and found that it matched closely with oligomers formed by endogenous Aβ in Tg2576 neurons. Large oligomers (24-36-mers), 8-mers, trimers, and dimers predominate. In both systems, Aβ formed oligomers intracellularly, which then appear to be secreted as oligomers. We then evaluated several factors that might impact oligomer formation. The level of oligomerization of Aβ1-40 was similar to that of Aβ1-42. Homodimers formed more readily than heterodimers. The level of oligomerization of murine Aβ1-42 was similar to that of human Aβ1-42. As expected, the familial AD-linked Arctic mutation (E22G) significantly enhanced oligomer formation. These data suggest that Gluc-tagged Aβ enables the analysis of Aβ oligomers."

Because fibronectin is a transcriptional target of β-catenin, this suggests the existence of a feedback loop between these two molecules that regulates dermal fibroblast cell behavior during wound repair. The healing process in response to cutaneous injury is characterized by regeneration of the cellular and extracellular components of the skin. This regeneration progresses through overlapping phases of inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling (1Singer A.J. Clark R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (4693) Google Scholar). The proliferative phase of healing involves the re-epithelialization of the superficial surface layer and the reconstitution of the underlying dermis by fibroblasts. The secretion of extracellular matrix components, such as fibronectin and collagen, by dermal fibroblasts during the proliferative phase is critical for successful wound repair, because these molecules are needed to re-establish the mechanical strength of the wound (2Clark R.A.

Peifer M. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1: a002881Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As a transcriptional co-activator, it is a crucial component of the canonical Wingless (Wnt) signaling pathway. Stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin can occur via Wnt-mediated regulation of a multiprotein complex, which includes glycogen-synthase kinase (GSK) 3β (7Cadigan K.M. Peifer M. Cold Spring Harb.

Elevation of the cytoplasmic β-catenin level enables its translocation to the nucleus where it associates with Tcf/Lef transcription co-factors to modulate gene expression. In the absence of an appropriate Wnt ligand, the multiprotein complex targets cytoplasmic β-catenin for proteasomal degradation via phosphorylation of N-terminal serine/threonine residues. The Wnt signaling inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) binds the Wnt co-receptor LRP6/Arrow to prevent Wnt-mediated signal transduction, thus inhibiting β-catenin-mediated Tcf-dependent transcription (8Bafico A.

Catnbtm2Kem mice used in wound healing studies possess loxP sites located in introns 1 and 6 of the Catnb gene, which when subjected to Cre-recombinase, results in a null allele (23Brault V. Moore R.

Tcf reporter mice express LacZ under the control of a c-fos minimal promoter and three Tcf-binding sites; β-catenin/Tcf-mediated transcriptional activity thus leads to the production of β-galactosidase (3Cheon S.S.

Although GD25 cells lack expression of the β1-integrin, they can adhere to substrates, such as fibronectin, via integrin αVβ3 (26Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S.

Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar) are immortalized cell lines originally established from wild type and GSK3β-null embryos. These cell lines were maintained in DMEM containing 3.7 g/liter of sodium bicarbonate, 10% FBS, and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture. For comparison of the effects of different extracellular matrix substrates on β-catenin levels and activity, fibroblasts were seeded (35,000–50,000 cells/10 cm2) at equal densities on tissue culture plastic and thin layer preparations of the following extracellular matrix molecules: collagen I (5 μg/cm2) from rat tail (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA); collagen IV (4 μg/cm2) from mouse (BD Biosciences); Matrigel (10 μg/cm2) (BD Biosciences); and human fibronectin (2 μg/cm2) (Sigma-Aldrich) and harvested after 48 h. For peptide treatments, Tcf reporter fibroblasts were treated with 1 mm RGDS peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle control and harvested 48 h later. Fibroblasts containing loxP sites flanking the β1 integrin gene (25Liu S. Xu S.W. Blumbach K. Eastwood M. Denton C.P. Eckes B. Krieg T. Abraham D.J. Leask A. J.

The cells were then cultured for an additional 4 days prior to lysis. Successful infection was verified by fluorescence microscopy, and recombination was assessed by Western blotting. Whole cell lysates were harvested from fibroblasts in reporter gene lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (28Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal.

The antibodies for phospho-GSK3β (serine 9) and phospho-STAT1 (Tyr-701) were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), whereas the total GSK3β (31Cheon S.S. Nadesan P. Poon R. Alman B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and Smad2/3 antibodies were from BD Biosciences. Western blots for phospho-GSK3β (serine 9) were stripped and reprobed with the antibody for the “total” form of the protein. Ad-DKK-1 was detected using an anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) (32Kuhnert F. Davis C.R. Wang H.T. Chu P. Lee M. Yuan J. Nusse R. Kuo C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), and antibodies for β1 integrin and GFP were also obtained from Santa Cruz. Protein expression levels were compared relative to the housekeeping proteins actin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) or GAPDH (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Densitometric analysis was performed using AlphaEaseFC 4.0 (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA) software. The immunoblots shown are representative of a minimum of three independent experiments. Cell pellets from primary dermal Tcf reporter fibroblasts grown on fibronectin and plastic were shipped to Kinexus Bioinformatics Corporation (Vancouver, Canada) where they were lysed and analyzed using the KinexTM antibody microarray (KAM 1.2), which contains 800 (500-pan-specific and 300-phosphorylation site-specific) antibodies. Ingenuity pathways analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) was used to identify the most highly up-regulated candidates, and the signaling pathways activated, from the log2(treated average/control average) expression data. Whole cell lysates were obtained from primary dermal fibroblasts derived from Tcf reporter mice (3Cheon S.S. Cheah A.Y. Turley S. Nadesan P. Poon R. Clevers H. Alman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 6973-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Samples were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by measuring the optical density at 570 nm, following hydrolysis of the enzyme substrate, chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C. The cells were seeded on 6-well 35-mm-diameter plates and transfected 24 h later with 0.7 μg of the Tcf-responsive pTOPFLASH reporter construct, which contains three Tcf-binding sites, or 0.7 μg of the corresponding pFOPFLASH construct, which contains three mutated Tcf sites (33Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar). A β-galactosidase expression vector (0.3 μg) served as a control for transfection efficiency. For each experiment, transfections were performed in triplicate using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions. Lysates were assayed for luciferase activity on a luminometer using luciferase assay substrate and buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Eda Fn+/+ and Eda Fn−/− mice used in experiments were between 8 and 12 weeks of age, and each study group contained five mice of the same genotype. For the studies involving the double-mutant Eda Fn−/−;Catnbtm1Tak and Eda Fn+/+;Catnbtm1Tak mice, each treatment group (Ad-GFP or Ad-CRE, with Ad-CRE conferring β-catenin protein stabilization) contained at least three mice between 8 and 16 weeks of age. These mice were homozygous for Eda Fn−/− or Eda Fn+/+ and contained at least one Catnbtm1Tak allele. Mice in the different groups were littermate controls. All of the experiments using mice were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada). Sterile skin biopsy punches (Miltex Inc., York, PA) with a diameter of 4 mm were used to create four full-thickness skin wounds on the dorsal surface (back) of the mouse. Circular wounds were harvested during the proliferative phase of healing at days 5–8 post-wounding or during the remodeling phase at days 12–14 postinjury. For mechanical testing of wound strength, 4-mm-long full thickness linear wounds were made on the dorsal surface of the mouse, using a scalpel. Seven days postwounding, 4-mm-wide linear sections were prepared as strips and tested for tensile mechanical properties on an Instron 4301 machine as previously described. A stress strain curve was generated, and loads were normalized to the cross-sectional area of the wound. The ultimate tensile strength and the work to failure were calculated (34Gurung A. Uddin F.

Treatment of mice with LiCl or NaCl as a control, was initiated 24 h prior to wounding and terminated at the time of wound harvest. NaCl or LiCl was added to the drinking water to a final concentration of 0.014 m. This dosage was previously shown to elevate β-catenin in mesenchymal cells in mice (6Cheon S.S. Wei Q. Gurung A.

The mice were injected subcutaneously with the adenovirus at a titer of 1 × 108 plaque-forming units at the future wound site, and also intraperitoneally, as previously reported (6Cheon S.S. Wei Q.

Wounds were harvested at either 5, 7, 12, or 14 days after injury, and the wounds were examined for size, cellularity, and β-catenin protein levels. Successful infection was determined by detecting the virus in the wound biopsy samples, and successful recombination was determined using DNA and/or protein analysis as previously reported (6Cheon S.S.

Poon R. Alman B.A. PLoS Med. 2007; 4: e249Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Because DKK-1 is a secreted protein, only small numbers of cells need to be infected for it to have an inhibitory effect on Wnt signaling (32Kuhnert F. Davis C.R. Wang H.T. Chu P. Lee M. Yuan J. Nusse R. Kuo C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Cutaneous wounds were dissected from the surrounding unwounded skin. Protein was isolated from tissue in lysis buffer, as described above, whereas mRNA was extracted from tissue using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Lysates from fracture repair were taken from those harvested from previously reported studies (38Chen Y. Whetstone H.C. Lin A.C. Nadesan P. Wei Q. Poon R. Alman B.A. PLoS Med. 2007; 4: e249Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). mRNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligod(T)15 primers (Invitrogen). Real time PCR analysis of the relative expression of collagen I and fibronectin in relation to GAPDH in mouse whole wounds, 7–8 days postinjury, was performed using TaqMan® gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). All of the reactions were run on an Applied Biosystems 7900 HT Fast real time PCR machine. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded wounds were used for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Sectioning of wounds was performed as previously described, with serial sections through the circular wound examined to identify the center (longest diameter) section of the wound (3Cheon S.S.

Invest. 2005; 85: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Wound size was examined using trichrome stained sections, whereas the general histologic appearance was examined in hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections. Heat-mediated antigen retrieval in sodium citrate buffer was performed for immunohistochemical analysis, with the exception of tissue sections stained with F4/80 and GFP, where antigen retrieval was performed using proteinase K. β-Catenin localization in wound sections was assessed using a polyclonal anti-rabbit β-catenin antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and a biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Labs Inc., Burlingame, CA). Fibroblasts (40Pilling D. Fan T. Huang D. Kaul B. Gomer R.H. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7475Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 41Kalluri R. Zeisberg M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar) in the wound sections were identified using an antibody that recognizes fibroblast activation protein (Abcam), myofibroblasts were detected using an antibody to α-smooth muscle actin (Abcam), macrophages were labeled using an antibody to F4/80 (42Austyn J.M. Gordon S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar) (AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK), and keratinocytes were localized using a keratin-14 (43Purkis P.E. Steel J.B. Mackenzie I.C. Nathrath W.B. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 39-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) antibody (Covance Inc., Princeton, NJ). GFP was detected using an antibody from Abcam. The appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody was used in combination with each primary antibody (Vector Labs Inc., Burlingame, CA). Strepdavidin-Dylight Conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Ltd., Rockford, IL) was used for fluorescent imaging of GFP. The mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval were calculated for each data set using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA). The data are presented as the means and 95% confidence intervals. Differences between groups of data were determined using the two-tailed Student's t test. Statistical significance is defined as p ≤ 0.05. During the proliferative phase of bone fracture repair, inhibition of Wnt signaling by overexpression of DKK-1 resulted in a complete abrogation of the elevation of the β-catenin protein level (38Chen Y. Whetstone H.C. Lin A.C. Nadesan P. Wei Q. Poon R. Alman B.A. PLoS Med. 2007; 4: e249Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To examine whether DKK-1 would inhibit the increase in β-catenin protein levels during cutaneous wound healing, we used an approach similar to that utilized in the studies of fracture repair. Mice subjected to a full thickness cutaneous wound were treated with either a DKK-1-expressing adenovirus or a control adenovirus (32Kuhnert F. Davis C.R. Wang H.T. Chu P. Lee M. Yuan J. Nusse R. Kuo C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 38Chen Y. Whetstone H.C. Lin A.C. Nadesan P. Wei Q. Poon R. Alman B.A. PLoS Med. 2007; 4: e249Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, we found only a modest decline in the level of β-catenin in wounds from DKK1-treated mice during the proliferative phase of cutaneous healing and no significant effect on the ultimate size or cellularity of the scar that developed (Fig. 1, A and B). Effective infection was verified by observation of viral protein production using Western analysis (Fig. 1C) and by observation of green fluorescent protein (GFP). The lack of a change in wound size or cellularity (with an average of 62 cells/high powered field in wild type mice and 58 cells in DKK-1-treated mice) contrasts starkly with data from mice expressing a conditional null allele of β-catenin activated using an identical adenovirus but that expresses Cre-recombinase instead of DKK-1 (average of 47 cells/high powered wound field), as previously reported (6Cheon S.S.

This suggests that an alternative pathway other than Wnt ligand activation plays a role in maintaining the β-catenin protein level during the proliferative phase of cutaneous wound repair.

We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in DSB repair genes may affect clinical outcomes among non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive radio(chemo)therapy. We genotyped six potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (i.e., RAD51 −135G>C/rs1801320 and −172G>T/rs1801321, XRCC2 4234G>C/rs3218384 and R188H/rs3218536 G>A, XRCC3 T241M/rs861539 and NBN E185Q/rs1805794) and estimated their associations with overall survival (OS) and radiation pneumonitis (RP) in 228 NSCLC patients. We found a predictive role of RAD51 −135G>C SNP in RP development (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.86, P = 0.010 for CG/CC vs. GG). We also found that RAD51 −135G>C and XRCC2 R188H SNPs were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (adjusted HR = 1.70, 95% CI, 1.14–2.62, P = 0.009 for CG/CC vs. GG; and adjusted HR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.02–2.85, P = 0.043 for AG vs. GG, respectively) and that the SNP-survival association was most pronounced in the presence of RP. Our study suggests that HR genetic polymorphisms, particularly RAD51 −135G>C, may influence overall survival and radiation pneumonitis in NSCLC patients treated with definitive radio(chemo)therapy. Large studies are needed to confirm our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2033350213,"The human 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) functions as a dimeric molecular chaperone. HSP90 identified on the cell surface has been found to play a crucial role in cancer invasion and metastasis, and has become a validated anti-cancer target for drug development. It has been shown to self-assemble into oligomers upon heat shock or divalent cations treatment, but the functional role of the oligomeric states in the chaperone cycle is not fully understood.Here we report the crystal structure of a truncated HSP90 that contains the middle segment and the carboxy-terminal domain, termed MC-HSP90. The structure reveals an architecture with triangular bipyramid geometry, in which the building block of the hexameric assembly is a dimer. In solution, MC-HSP90 exists in three major oligomer states, namely dimer, tetramer and hexamer, which were elucidated by size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. The newly discovered HSP90 isoform HSP90N that lacks the N-terminal ATPase domain also exhibited similar oligomerization states as did MC-HSP90.While lacking the ATPase domain, both MC-HSP90 and HSP90N can self-assemble into a hexameric structure, spontaneously. The crystal structure of MC-HSP90 reveals that, in addition to the C-terminal dimerization domain, the residue W320 in the M domain plays a critical role in its oligomerization. This study not only demonstrates how the human MC-HSP90 forms a hexamer, but also justifies the similar formation of HSP90N by using 3D modeling analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2066131230,"CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the main effectors of adaptive cellular immune responses, differentiate from immature, non-functional CD4+CD8+ double-positive T (DPT) cells in the thymus. Increased proportions of circulating DPT lymphocytes have been observed during acute viral infections; in chronic viral diseases, the role and repartition of extra-thymic DPT cells remain largely uncharacterized. We performed a phenotypic analysis of DPT cells in blood and liver from patients chronically infected by hepatitis C (HCV) or B (HBV) viruses. The highest percentages of DPT cells, predominantly CD4highCD8low, were observed in patients infected by HCV, while HBV-infected patients mostly displayed CD4lowCD8high and CD4highCD8high DPT cells. All proportions of DPT cells were higher in liver than in blood with, for each subpopulation referred to above, a correlation between their frequencies in these two compartments. In HCV patients, intra-hepatic DPT cells displayed more heterogeneous activation, differentiation and memory phenotypes than in the blood; most of them expressed CD1a, a marker of T cell development in the thymus. Ex vivo, the inoculation of liver slices with HCV produced in cell culture was accompanied by a disappearance of CD8high cells, suggesting a direct effect of the virus on the phenotype of DPT cells in the liver. Our results suggest that, in half of the patients, chronic HCV infection promotes the production of DPT cells, perhaps by their re-induction in the thymus and selection in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2075410251,"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a collagen-binding protein that is abundantly distributed in various tissues, including the eye. It exhibits various biological functions, such as anti-angiogenic, neurotrophic, and neuroprotective activities. PEDF also interacts with extracellular matrix components such as collagen, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), and hyaluronan. The collagen-binding property has been elucidated to be important for the anti-angiogenic activity in vivo (Hosomichi, J., Yasui, N., Koide, T., Soma, K., and Morita, I. (2005) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 335, 756-761). Here, we investigated the collagen recognition mechanism by PEDF. We first narrowed down candidate PEDF-binding sequences by taking advantage of previously reported structural requirements in collagen. Subsequent searches for PEDF-binding sequences employing synthetic collagen-like peptides resulted in the identification of one of the critical binding sites for PEDF, human α1(I)(929-938) (IKGHRGFSGL). Further analysis revealed that the collagen recognition by PEDF is sequence- and conformation-specific, and the high affinity binding motif is KGXRGFXGL in the triple helix. The PEDF-binding motif significantly overlapped with the heparin/HSPG-binding motif, KGHRG(F/Y). The interaction of PEDF with collagen I was specifically competed with by heparin but not by chondroitin sulfate-C or hyaluronan. The binding sequences for PEDF and heparin/HSPG also overlapped with the covalent cross-linking sites between collagen molecules. These findings imply a functional relationship between PEDF and HSPGs during angiogenesis, and the interaction of these molecules is regulated by collagen modifications."
https://openalex.org/W1995430527,"Background XMRV is the most recently described retrovirus to be found in Man, firstly in patients with prostate cancer (PC) and secondly in 67% of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and 3.7% of controls. Both disease associations remain contentious. Indeed, a recent publication has concluded that “XMRV is unlikely to be a human pathogen”. Subsequently related but different polytropic MLV (pMLV) sequences were also reported from the blood of 86.5% of patients with CFS. and 6.8% of controls. Consequently we decided to investigate blood donors for evidence of XMRV/pMLV. Methodology/Principal Findings Testing of cDNA prepared from the whole blood of 80 random blood donors, generated gag PCR signals from two samples (7C and 9C). These had previously tested negative for XMRV by two other PCR based techniques. To test whether the PCR mix was the source of these sequences 88 replicates of water were amplified using Invitrogen Platinum Taq (IPT) and Applied Biosystems Taq Gold LD (ABTG). Four gag sequences (2D, 3F, 7H, 12C) were generated with the IPT, a further sequence (12D) by ABTG re-amplification of an IPT first round product. Sequence comparisons revealed remarkable similarities between these sequences, endogeous MLVs and the pMLV sequences reported in patients with CFS. Conclusions/Significance Methodologies for the detection of viruses highly homologous to endogenous murine viruses require special caution as the very reagents used in the detection process can be a source of contamination and at a level where it is not immediately apparent. It is suggested that such contamination is likely to explain the apparent presence of pMLV in CFS."
https://openalex.org/W1972794694,"We have shown that cytokine-like 1 (Cytl1) is a novel autocrine regulatory factor that regulates chondrogenesis of mouse mesenchymal cells (Kim, J. S., Ryoo, Z. Y., and Chun, J. S. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 29359–29367). In this previous work, we found that Cytl1 expression was very low in mesenchymal cells, increased dramatically during chondrogenesis, and decreased during hypertrophic maturation, both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, exogenous addition or ectopic expression of Cytl1 caused chondrogenic differentiation of mouse limb bud mesenchymal cells. In the current study, we generated a Cytl1 knock-out (Cytl1−/−) mouse to investigate the in vivo role of Cytl1. Deletion of the Cytl1 gene did not affect chondrogenesis or cartilage development. Cytl1−/− mice also showed normal endochondral ossification and long bone development. Additionally, ultrastructural features of articular cartilage, such as matrix organization and chondrocyte morphology, were similar in wild-type and Cytl1−/− mice. However, Cytl1−/− mice were more sensitive to osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage destruction. Compared with wild-type littermates, Cytl1−/− mice showed more severe OA cartilage destruction upon destabilization of the medial meniscus of mouse knee joints. In addition, expression levels of Cytl1 were markedly decreased in OA cartilage of humans and experimental mice. Taken together, our results suggest that, rather than regulating cartilage and bone development, Cytl1 is required for the maintenance of cartilage homeostasis, and loss of Cytl1 function is associated with experimental OA cartilage destruction in mice.

Cartilage development is initiated by the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes (1Goldring M.B. Tsuchimochi K. Ijiri K. J. Cell.

Developed cartilage either remains as a permanent cartilage tissue, such as joint articular cartilage, or serves as a template for long bone development during endochondral ossification. Endochondral ossification requires hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes. The sequential events that occur during chondrogenesis and cartilage and bone development are precisely regulated by various regulatory factors released from cartilage elements and the perichondrium (1Goldring M.B.

In permanent cartilage tissue, cartilage homeostasis is maintained by chondrocytes, which are a cell type unique to cartilage tissue. Cartilage homeostasis is disrupted in osteoarthritis (OA), leading to eventual cartilage destruction. OA is a progressive and degenerative disorder of the joint primarily characterized by articular cartilage destruction. A variety of potential OA-causing mechanisms have been proposed (5Goldring M.B. Goldring S.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 213: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 6Martel-Pelletier J. Boileau C. Pelletier J.P. Roughley P.J. Best Pract. Res. Clin.

Biophysical and biochemical factors, such as mechanical stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively, are responsible for disruption of cartilage homeostasis and initiation of the catabolic pathway. This, in turn, activates intracellular pathways in chondrocytes that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammation, degradation of the ECM by matrix-degrading enzymes, and cessation of ECM synthesis via dedifferentiation and apoptosis of chondrocytes (5Goldring M.B. Goldring S.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 213: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 6Martel-Pelletier J. Boileau C. Pelletier J.P. Roughley P.J. Best Pract. Res. Clin.

We have previously shown that cytokine-like 1 (Cytl1) is a novel autocrine regulatory factor involved in chondrogenesis of mouse mesenchymal cells in vitro (8Kim J.S. Ryoo Z.Y. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29359-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CYTL1 was originally cloned as a functionally unknown cytokine candidate from human bone marrow and cord blood mononuclear cells bearing the CD34 surface marker (9Liu X. Rapp N. Deans R. Cheng L. Genomics. 2000; 65: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The CYTL1 protein contains four α-helices and six conserved cysteine residues, which may form intra-disulfide bonds to yield a globular structure, a common structural characteristic of cytokines. CYTL1 also contains an N-terminal secretory signal peptide, and its secretion is associated with post-translational modifications, although the nature of these modifications remains to be established (8Kim J.S. Ryoo Z.Y. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29359-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The CYTL1 gene is found in vertebrates, including humans, chickens, and Fugu rubripes, but has not been detected in invertebrates, such as Drosophila or Caenorhabditis elegans. Thus, CYTL1 appears to have originated early in vertebrate evolution, suggesting a possible functions in cartilage and bone development. Indeed, CYTL1 expression has been found in cartilaginous tissues, such as mouse inner ear and human articular cartilage (10Ficker M. Powles N. Warr N. Pirvola U. Maconochie M. Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 7-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Hermansson M. Sawaji Y. Bolton M. Alexander S. Wallace A. Begum S. Wait R. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43514-43521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In our previous study (8Kim J.S. Ryoo Z.Y. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29359-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we showed that mouse Cytl1 expression was chondrocyte-specific, and further demonstrated that Cytl1 expression was very low in mesenchymal cells, dramatically increased during chondrogenesis, and decreased during hypertrophic maturation, both in vivo and in vitro. Exogenous addition of Cytl1 protein or lentivirus-mediated overexpression of Cytl1 caused chondrogenic differentiation of mouse limb bud mesenchymal cells during micromass culture. However, Cytl1 did not affect the hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes. We have also demonstrated that mouse Cytl1 exerts its chondrogenic effect via stimulation of Sox9 transcriptional activity and induction of insulin-like growth factor (Igf) 1, which has the capacity to induce chondrogenesis (8Kim J.S. Ryoo Z.Y. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29359-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The chondrocyte-specific expression pattern of Cytl1 and its chondrogenic effects observed in vitro suggest a possible role of Cytl1 in cartilage and bone development and/or maintenance of cartilage homeostasis. To investigate the in vivo role of Cytl1, we generated Cytl1 knock-out (Cytl1−/−) mice. We report here that deletion of the Cytl1 gene did not affect cartilage or bone development, despite the in vitro chondrogenic effects of Cytl1. However, Cytl1−/− mice were more sensitive to OA cartilage destruction, suggesting a role in the maintenance of cartilage homeostasis. Male mice (C57BL/6, Cytl1−/−, STR/ort, and CBA/CaCrl) were used for cartilage and bone development and experimental OA studies. Cytl1−/− mice were generated as described below. STR/ort and CBA/CaCrl mice were obtained from Harlan Laboratories, Inc. (Borchen, Germany). Animals were maintained under pathogen-free conditions. All experiments were approved by the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology Animal Care and Use Committee. A targeting vector for deleting a segment containing a sequence of the Cytl1 gene from exon 1 to exon 2 (∼2.1 kb) was constructed using a 5′ short arm fragment (2.7 kb) and 3′ long arm fragment (7.3 kb) ligated into the pOsdupdel vector (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL). Short arm and long arm fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNA obtained from 129/SvJ mouse J1 embryonic stem cells. The 2.7-kb NheI-XhoI fragment (5′ short arm) was amplified using forward (5′-gctagcaaaggagccacagaaatat-3′) and reverse (5′-ctcgagtgggacactgaattcttt-3′) primers containing NheI and XhoI sites, respectively (underlined). The 7.3-kb BamHI-NotI fragment (3′ long arm) was amplified using forward (5′-ggatccagctcagtctctggccctct-3′) and reverse (5′-gcggccgccaccagtgaaaagaattaa-3′) primers containing BamHI and NotI sites, respectively (underlined). The targeting vector was designed to replace the ∼2.1 kb genomic fragment with a positive selection marker containing a polyoma enhancer/herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and neomycin resistance gene. A negative selection marker containing an HSV-1 promoter derived from the thymidine kinase gene was appended to the construct to select against nonhomologous recombination. The targeting vector was linearized with NotI and electroporated into 129/SvJ mouse J1 embryonic stem cells. Clones resistant to G418 and ganciclovir were selected, and homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern blotting. The clones containing the targeted mutation were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, which were subsequently transferred into pseudopregnant foster mothers. The resulting male chimeric mice were bred to C57BL/6 females to obtain heterozygous Cytl1+/− mice. Heterozygous mice were crossed to generate homozygous Cytl1−/− mice. For Southern blot analysis, mouse genomic DNA obtained from 129/SvJ mouse J1 embryonic stem cells was digested with BamHI and hybridized with a 314-bp probe amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the primers 5′-cctctacactctccacattcc-3′ (forward) and 5′-aagggcatcgaaggagtcctt-3′ (reverse). The probe detects 14.8-kb and 4.6-kb DNA fragment in WT and Cytl1−/− mice, respectively. Genotypes of WT and Cytl1−/− mice were determined by RT-PCR analysis from tail genomic DNA.

Open table in a new tab Micromass cultures of mesenchymal cells were performed as described previously (8Kim J.S. Ryoo Z.Y. Chun J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 36563-36571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, mesenchymal cells obtained from E11.5 embryos of WT and Cytl1−/− mice were digested with 1% trypsin and 0.2% type II collagenase (381 units/mg solid; Sigma) for 10 min. A total of 2 × 107 cells were suspended in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 medium (2:3; Invitrogen) containing 0.1% or 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The cells were spotted as 15 μl drops on culture dishes and maintained for 5 days to induce chondrogenesis. Chondrogenesis was determined by examining the expression of type II collagen (Col2a1) by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and by detecting accumulation of sulfate proteoglycans via Alcian blue staining. Rib chondrocytes were prepared from 2-day-old newborn wild-type (WT) and Cytl1−/− mice (8Kim J.S. Ryoo Z.Y. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29359-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The cartilage rib cages were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.2% trypsin and 0.2% collagenase type II in DMEM, and rinsed with PBS. The tissues were digested with 0.2% type II collagenase in DMEM for 90 min. The cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin, and were plated on culture dishes at a density of 5.0 × 104 cells/cm2. Sox9 reporter gene activity in chondrifying mesenchymal cells was determined as described previously (8Kim J.S. Ryoo Z.Y. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29359-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, a reporter gene containing the 48 bp Sox9 binding site in the first intron of Col2a1 was inserted into the pGL3-promoter luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). pGL3-control or Sox9 reporter gene (1 μg) was transfected into isolated mesenchymal cells 6 h after spotting using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were co-transfected with pCMV-β-galactosidase expression vector (0.2 μg) as an internal control to ensure transfection efficiency. The cells were maintained as micromass culture for 4 days in complete medium. Luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity. Human normal cartilage was obtained from individuals undergoing arthroscopic meniscectomy or meniscal repair. Human OA knee joint cartilage was obtained from individuals (age 51–72 years) undergoing arthroplasty (13Hwang S.G. Ryu J.H. Kim I.C. Jho E.H. Jung H.C. Kim K. Kim S.J. Chun J.S. J. Biol.

The Review Board of the Wonkwang University Hospital approved the use of these materials, and all individuals provided full written informed consent before the procedure. The International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grading system was used to score cartilage destruction (14Yang S. Kim J. Ryu J.H. Oh H. Chun C.H. Kim B.J. Min B.H. Chun J.S. Nat.

Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2005; 13: 958-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The classification ranges from healthy cartilage (grade 0) to the absence of cartilage with exposed subchondral bone (grade 4). The score criteria are the quantity and depth of lesions, either visually inspected by arthroscopy or non-invasively by magnetic resonance imaging (15Kleemann R.U. Krocker D. Cedraro A. Tuischer J. Duda G.N. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2005; 13: 958-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Spontaneous OA in STR/ort mice was examined at 28 weeks of age and compared with gender-matched CBA control mice (14Yang S. Kim J. Ryu J.H. Oh H. Chun C.H. Kim B.J. Min B.H. Chun J.S. Nat.

Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 85-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Experimental OA was induced by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) and a sham operation was used as a control, as described previously (17Glasson S.S. Blanchet T.J. Morris E.A. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2007; 15: 1061-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Cartilage destruction was examined by Safranin-O staining and scored by Mankin's method (14Yang S. Kim J. Ryu J.H. Oh H. Chun C.H. Kim B.J. Min B.H. Chun J.S. Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 18Mankin H.J. Dorfman H. Lippiello L. Zarins A. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 1971; 53: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). This score is the sum of cartilage structure (0–6), cellularity (0–3), and Safranin-O staining (0–4). For histological analyses, human normal and OA cartilage were frozen, sectioned (6 μm thick), and fixed in paraformaldehyde. Sulfate proteoglycan was detected by Alcian blue staining. Control and OA cartilage tissues from mice were fixed in paraformaldehyde, decalcified, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (6 μm), and stained with Safranin-O, as described previously (14Yang S. Kim J. Ryu J.H. Oh H. Chun C.H. Kim B.J. Min B.H. Chun J.S. Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Col2a1 and Prg4 (lubricin) proteins were detected by a standard immunohistochemical staining method using mouse anti-chicken Col2a1 antibody (Millipore) and rabbit anti-human Prg4 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Whole embryos and postnatal mice were skinned, eviscerated, and fixed with 95% ethanol for 4 days and treated with acetone for 3 days. Cartilage was stained with Alcian blue (1 volume of 0.3% Alcian blue 8GX in 70% ethanol, 1 volume of 100% acetic acid, and 18 volumes of 100% ethanol), as described previously (19Huh Y.H. Ryu J.H. Shin S. Lee D.U. Yang S. Oh K.S. Chun C.H. Choi J.K. Song W.K. Chun J.S. Gene. 2009; 448: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Skeletal staining was performed for 10 days with freshly prepared staining solution (1 volume of 0.1% Alizarin red S in 95% ethanol, 1 volume of 0.3% Alcian blue 8GX in 70% ethanol, 1 volume of 100% acetic acid, and 17 volumes of 100% ethanol). The samples were sequentially destained with 1% KOH for up to 48 h, and 20% glycerol containing 1% KOH for 7 days. Humerus, ulna, femur, and tibia longitudinal lengths were measured with the microscope image-analysis program, AxioVision (Carl Zeiss), using Alcian blue- and Alizarin red-stained samples. Histological analyses of cartilage and bones were performed as described previously (14Yang S. Kim J. Ryu J.H. Oh H. Chun C.H. Kim B.J. Min B.H. Chun J.S. Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 19Huh Y.H. Ryu J.H. Shin S. Lee D.U. Yang S. Oh K.S. Chun C.H. Choi J.K. Song W.K. Chun J.S. Gene. 2009; 448: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, limbs of embryos and postnatal bones were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and the tissues were embedded in paraffin. For postnatal tissue, bones were decalcified in 0.5 m EDTA (pH 7.4) for 7 days at 4 °C before paraffin embedding. The paraffin blocks were sectioned (5 μm), deparaffinized in xylene, and hydrated with a series of graded ethanol. The deparaffinized sections were stained with 1% Alcian blue in 0.1 n HCl for 10 min and then washed in 0.1 n HCl for 5 min. Serial sections were stained with 2% Alizarin red in water for 5 min, washed in acetone, and cleared in xylene. Von Kossa staining was performed by incubating sections with 5% silver nitrate for 1 h and then with 5% sodium thiosulfate for 3 min, followed by washing in water and clearing in xylene. For hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, the sections were incubated in Harry's hematoxylin for 1 min, washed in running tap water, soaked in 95% ethanol for 1 min, and then in eosin for 10 s. After hydrating in graded ethanol, the samples were cleared with xylene (14Yang S. Kim J. Ryu J.H. Oh H. Chun C.H. Kim B.J. Min B.H. Chun J.S. Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses, articular cartilage from 4-week-old WT and Cytl1−/− mice was gently removed using a scalpel and subjected to a double fixation procedure. Cartilage tissue was first fixed with Karnowsky fixative for 4 h at 4 °C, washed in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 1 h. The specimens were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, exchanged with propylene oxide, and embedded in a mixture of Epon 812 and Araldite (Polysciences Inc., Washington, PA). The embedded tissues were thin-sectioned on a Leica Em UC6 Ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl and lead citrate, and viewed in a FEL Tecnai G2 electron microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, Netherlands) operated at 80 kV. Total RNA was isolated from cartilage tissue and primary cultured chondrocytes. The RNA was reverse-transcribed, and the resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers and experimental conditions summarized in Table 1. Transcript levels were quantified by qRT-PCR as described previously (20Ryu J.H. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22039-22047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21Huh Y.H. Ryu J.H. Chun J.S. J. Biol.

Lainchbury J.G. Maeda N. Smithies O. Richards A.M. Cameron V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792: 1175-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts from 2-week-old mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded. Sections (6 μm) were stained with H&E solution, as described above. Lung sections were obtained from 2-week-old mice, as described previously (23Kurotani R. Tomita T. Yang Q. Carlson B.A. Chen C. Kimura S. Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 2008; 178: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After embedding in paraffin, lung paraffin blocks were sectioned (6 μm), deparaffinized in xylene, and stained with H&E. Statistical significance was evaluated using Student's t test. Significance was accepted at the 0.05 level of probability (p < 0.05). We have previously shown that chondrocyte-specific Cytl1, as a novel autocrine factor, regulates in vitro chondrogenesis during micromass culture of mouse mesenchymal cells without directly affecting hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes (8Kim J.S. Ryoo Z.Y. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29359-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To elucidate the in vivo function of Cytl1 in cartilage and bone development and maintenance of cartilage homeostasis, we generated Cytl1−/− mice by deleting a segment (∼2.1 kb) of the Cytl1 gene from exon 1 to exon 2, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1A). Cytl1−/− mice were viable and showed normal postnatal growth (Fig. 1B). Genotypes of offspring and knock-out of Cytl1 were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1C). We first examined phenotypic changes in chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells and cartilage development in Cytl1−/− mice. The role of Cytl1 in chondrogenesis was examined by micromass culture of mesenchymal cells isolated from WT and Cytl1−/− E11.5 embryos. Similar patterns of chondrogenesis were observed in WT and Cytl1−/− mesenchymal cells, as determined by Alcian blue staining of sulfate proteoglycan (Fig. 2A). Additionally, expression patterns of the chondrocyte markers Col2a1, aggrecan (Acan), chondromodulin 1 (Lect1), Sox9, and Igf1, and Sox9 transcriptional activity were similar between WT and Cytl1−/− cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, deletion of the Cytl1 gene did not affect chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells in vitro. Chondrogenesis and cartilage development in vivo was examined by Alcian blue staining of limb buds and whole embryos. Patterns of cartilage development in limb buds of E12.5 and E13.5 embryos and whole embryo at E14.5 were similar in WT and Cytl1−/− mice (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these results indicate that the patterns of in vitro chondrogenesis and in vivo cartilage development are normal in Cytl1−/− mice. Because cartilage serves as a template for long bone development during endochondral ossification (2Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar, 4Provot S. Schipani E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), we next examined endochondral ossification and long bone developmental patterns in Cytl1−/− mice. At E18.5, the skeletal structure of whole embryos (Fig. 3A), autopod developmental patterns (Fig. 3B), and lengths of long bones (i.e. ulna, humerus, tibia, and femur; Fig. 3C) were similar in Cytl1−/− and WT littermates. The lengths of mineralized zones, determined by Alcian blue or von Kossa staining, of radius and ulna at E16.5, and lengths of hypertrophic zones were also similar in WT and Cytl1−/− mice (Fig. 3D). Additionally, the overall patterns of growth plate, zones of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes, and secondary ossification center were also similar in 2-week-old WT and Cytl1−/− mice (Fig. 3E). Taken together, our results indicate that endochondral ossification and long bone development patterns are normal in Cytl1−/− mice. Next, we examined whether deletion of the Cytl1 gene affected ultrastructure and maintenance of articular cartilage. Alcian blue staining of articular cartilage from 4-week-old WT and Cytl1−/− mice showed no apparent differences in the overall structure of cartilage (Fig. 4A). Ultrastructural features of articular cartilage, such as ECM organization and morphology of chondrocytes, were examined by TEM using articular cartilage explants from 4-week-old WT and Cytl1−/− mice. The density of the matrix and the thickness of the collagen fibril network in articular cartilage were similar in WT and Cytl1−/− mice (Fig. 4B). Additionally, there were no evident differences in chondrocyte morphology between WT and Cytl1−/− mice (Fig. 4C). The role of Cytl1 in OA cartilage destruction was examined using an experimental OA model. We induced OA cartilage destruction in both WT and Cytl1−/− mice by DMM surgery. DMM surgical instability in the mice was caused by a 3 mm longitudinal incision over the distal patella to proximal tibial plateau. This model induced OA with a high reproducibility and slow progression of the disease (17Glasson S.S. Blanchet T.J. Morris E.A. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2007; 15: 1061-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed 7 weeks after surgery, and cartilage destruction was examined by Safranin-O staining and scored using a Mankin's methods (18Mankin H.J. Dorfman H. Lippiello L. Zarins A. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 1971; 53: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). DMM surgery caused OA cartilage destruction in both WT and Cytl1−/−, leading to the loss of Safranin-O stained proteoglycans in comparison to their respective sham controls. However, the degree of cartilage destruction was more remarkable in Cytl1−/− than in WT. We consistently observed a marked reduction in cartilage thickness and irregular cartilage surface in Cytl1−/−, both of which corresponded to the characteristics of more advanced OA (Fig. 5A). Indeed, scoring of cartilage destruction by Mankin's method indicated statistically significant augmentation of cartilage destruction in Cytl1−/− mice (Fig. 5B). In addition, immunostaining of Col2a1 and Prg4, whose down-regulations are associated with OA pathogenesis, indicated that DMM caused reduction in the expression levels of Col2a1 and Prg4 in degenerating cartilage, and this effect was more evident in Cytl1−/− mice (Fig. 5C). Finally, we examined whether Cytl1−/− mice exhibit spontaneous OA with age. Safranin-O staining and scoring by Mankin's method indicated enhanced cartilage destruction in 10-month-old Cytl1−/− mice compared with corresponding WT mice (Fig. 5D). However, the degree of spontaneous cartilage destruction was relatively weak at this age when compared with OA cartilage destruction by DMM surgery (Fig. 5, B and D). To confirm the association between Cytl1 expression and OA cartilage destruction, we examined CYTL1 mRNA levels in OA cartilage. CYTL1 mRNA levels in OA cartilage in DMM model animals were markedly decreased compared with those in sham-operated controls (Fig. 6A). To extend these observations, we also examined Cytl1 expression in the cartilage of STR/ort mice, which are genetically predisposed to develop OA-like lesions in the medial tibial cartilage. The majority (>85%) of male STR/ort mice have been shown to display signs of cartilage destruction at 6 months of age (16Mason R.M. Chambers M.G. Flannelly J. Gaffen J.D. Dudhia J. Bayliss M.T. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 85-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Compared with gender-matched CBA control mice, STR/ort mice showed severe cartilage destruction and down-regulation of Cytl1 expression (Fig. 6B). Finally, we examined CYTL1 expression in normal human cartilage obtained from individuals experiencing meniscus problems during arthroscopic meniscectomy or meniscal repair and OA-affected human cartilage obtained from individuals undergoing arthroplasty. CYTL1 mRNA levels were markedly reduced in human OA cartilage compared with those in undamaged normal cartilage (Fig. 6C). Cartilage damage in OA-affected individuals was confirmed by scoring of Alcian blue-stained samples according to the ICRS grading system (14Yang S. Kim J. Ryu J.H. Oh H. Chun C.H. Kim B.J. Min B.H. Chun J.S. Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 15Kleemann R.U. Krocker D. Cedraro A. Tuischer J. Duda G.N. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2005; 13: 958-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, all examined OA cartilage showed marked down-regulation of Cytl1, and deletion of Cytl1 enhanced OA cartilage destruction, suggesting the involvement of Cytl1 in the maintenance of cartilage homeostasis. Finally, we examined Cytl1 mRNA levels in OA cartilage at different time points after DMM surgery. Notably, decrease in Cytl1 expression levels, as determined by qRT-PCR analysis, preceded OA cartilage destruction, which was determined by Mankin score. The decrease in Cytl1 expression was detected as early as 1 day after DMM surgery, whereas cartilage destruction occurred 2 weeks after DMM surgery (Fig. 6D), suggesting a possible protective role of Cytl1 in OA cartilage destruction. We have previously shown that Cytl1 is also expressed in lung and heart, although at much lower levels than in cartilage (8Kim J.S. Ryoo Z.Y. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29359-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We therefore examined possible phenotypic changes in the lungs and hearts of Cytl1−/− mice (Fig. 7). The size and weight of lungs in 2-week- and 12-week-old mice were essentially the same in Cytl1−/− mice and WT littermates. Additionally, H&E staining of lung sections from Cytl1−/− mice showed an alveolar structure similar to that of WT littermates (Fig. 7A). Moreover, there were no apparent differences in the size or weight of hearts or histology of heart sections between WT and Cytl1−/− mice (Fig. 7B), indicating that lung and heart developmental patterns in Cytl1−/− mice are normal. We demonstrated in this study that deletion of the Cytl1 gene in mice does not affect cartilage development, endochondral ossification, or long bone development, despite the in vitro chondrogenic effects of Cytl1. However, Cytl1 appears to be required for the maintenance of cartilage homeostasis. This conclusion is suggested by the decreased expression of Cytl1 in OA cartilage and the more severe OA cartilage destruction in Cytl1−/− mice compared with WT mice. An examination of Cytl1 expression in a number of mouse tissues, including lung, heart, trachea, testis, eye, brain, kidney, muscle, spleen, and liver, has shown that Cytl1 is predominantly expressed in cartilage. Additionally, Cytl1 expression is detected only in primary cultured chondrocytes but not in HTB-94 chondrosarcoma or ATDC5 chondroprogenitor cells (8Kim J.S. Ryoo Z.Y. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29359-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, Cytl1 expression is specific to differentiated chondrocytes; its expression is not detected in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, hypertrophic chondrocytes, or de-differentiated chondrocytes generated by serial subculture as a monolayer. Cytl1 expression in vivo is also chondrocyte-specific; it is detected only in Col2a1-expressing chondrocytes but not in other cell types (e.g. hypertrophic chondrocytes) in developing cartilage and bone (8Kim J.S. Ryoo Z.Y. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29359-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially hypothesized that Cytl1 regulates chondrogenesis, maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of chondrocytes, and/or hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes. Indeed, in vitro experiments using micromass culture of mouse mesenchymal cells demonstrated that Cytl1 has the capacity to induce chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells by activating Sox9 transcriptional activity (8Kim J.S. Ryoo Z.Y. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29359-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, in this previous study, we were not able to assess the effects of Cytl1 silencing because we were inexplicably unable to knock down Cytl1 expression with any of the various siRNAs and shRNAs tested. In the current study, we examined the in vivo function of Cytl1 by generating Cytl1−/− mice. Unexpectedly, and contrary to the in vitro chondrogenic effects of Cytl1, we found that Cytl1−/− mice exhibited normal cartilage development and endochondral ossification. We also observed that chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells induced by micromass culture was normal in mesenchymal cells isolated from Cytl1−/− mice. Therefore, although exogenous Cytl1 or ectopic expression Cytl1 causes in vitro chondrogenesis, Cytl1 does not appear to be essential for the induction of chondrogenesis. However, this interpretation should be considered with care. Chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells by micromass culture is normally induced in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum. In our previous study, the chondrogenic effects of exogenous Cytl1 or ectopically expressed Cytl1 were not observed in 10% serum, but were evident under low serum (0.1%) conditions (8Kim J.S. Ryoo Z.Y. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29359-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the current study, we observed no differences in chondrogenesis of mesenchymal cells isolated from WT and Cytl1−/− mice in the presence of 10% serum, whereas chondrogenesis was not observed in 0.1% serum (Fig. 2A). Thus, it is possible that certain factors present in serum may overcome the effects of Cytl1 deletion. Nevertheless, the fact that cartilage development in Cytl1−/− mice is normal indicates that Cytl1 is not essential for chondrogenesis or subsequent cartilage development in vivo. Consequently, endochondral ossification and long bone development are also not affected by Cytl1 deletion in mice. Thus, our current results demonstrate that Cytl1 does not have a critical role in chondrogenesis, cartilage development, or endochondral ossification during long bone development in mice. Although Cytl1 is not involved in cartilage or bone development, we demonstrated in this study that it is associated with the maintenance of articular cartilage homeostasis. Expression of Cytl1 was markedly decreased in degenerating OA cartilage of humans and mice. Additionally, deletion of the Cytl1 gene enhanced OA cartilage destruction caused by DMM surgery. Although the stimulatory effects of Cytl1 deletion in OA cartilage destruction were not dramatic, they were statistically significant. Therefore, it is likely that the loss of Cytl1 function facilitates OA progression. Indeed, the decrease in Cytl1 expression preceded OA cartilage destruction, suggesting that Cytl1 exerts protective effects against cartilage degeneration. The current study did not elucidate the stimulatory mechanisms underlying OA cartilage destruction in Cytl1−/− mice. In conditions that predispose toward OA, such as aging and genetic defects, OA cartilage destruction is caused by mechanical stimuli, which activate intracellular signaling pathways in chondrocytes that lead to a variety of effects, including the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammation, degradation of the ECM by matrix metalloproteinases and ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinases with thrombospondin motifs), and cessation of ECM synthesis via dedifferentiation and apoptosis of chondrocytes (5Goldring M.B.

Because ultrastructural features of articular cartilage such as ECM organization and chondrocyte morphology are normal in Cytl1−/− mice, it is likely that other factors, such as biochemical pathways, are altered in Cytl1−/− mice during OA pathogenesis."

This role is particularly important, because keratinocyte differentiation is associated with cessation of proliferation, and it would make mechanistic sense to have a common kinase activate both processes. A limited number of studies have examined the mechanism of nPKC regulation of keratinocyte proliferation. For example, the nPKC isoform PKCϵ binds to and activates Fyn, a Src kinase, and this is associated with reduced keratinocyte proliferation (36Cabodi S. Calautti E. Talora C. Kuroki T. Stein P.L. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1121-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PKCϵ forms a complex with cyclin E-cdk2-p21Cip1 leading to phosphorylation of p21Cip1 and cdk2 inhibition to reduce proliferation (37Kashiwagi M. Ohba M. Watanabe H. Ishino K. Kasahara K. Sanai Y. Taya Y. Kuroki T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6334-6341Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, PKCα suppresses proliferation in raft cultures of human keratinocytes by a mechanism that involves increased expression of p21Cip1 (17Jerome-Morais A. Rahn H.R. Tibudan S.S. Denning M.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2009; 129: 2365-2375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This realization that PKC regulates cell proliferation points to the intriguing possibility that a single regulatory cascade may both increase differentiation and suppress proliferation, key processes that must proceed together during keratinocyte maturation. However, we have limited understanding regarding the mechanism of growth suppression. p21Cip1 is an important regulator of cell cycle progression, and increased p21Cip1 expression is associated with cessation of cell proliferation (38Gorospe M. Wang X. Holbrook N.J. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 377-385PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, p21Cip1 has been implicated as a key suppressor of proliferation progression in human keratinocytes (39Wong P.P.

Our studies indicate that PKCδ increases expression of the Kruppel-like factor KLF4, which interacts at GC-rich DNA elements in the proximal p21Cip1 promoter to activate p21Cip1 gene expression leading to cessation of cell proliferation.

The resulting virus is called tAd5-hKLF4. Expression of hKLF4 from this virus requires co-infection with Ad5-TA, which produces the tetracycline transactivator (51Sturniolo M.T. Chandraratna R.A. Eckert R.L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2963-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For experiments, the keratinocytes were incubated with 15 MOI of tAd5-EV or tAd5-hKLF4 in the presence of 2.5 MOI of Ad5-TA virus in keratinocyte serum-free medium containing 6 μg/ml of polybrene. Primary cultures of human epidermal keratinocytes were prepared from human foreskins and maintained in KSFM (29Efimova T. Deucher A. Kuroki T. Ohba M. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31753-31760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For p21Cip1 promoter activity analysis, 0.5 μg of p21Cip1 promoter reporter plasmid was mixed with 1 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent diluted with 99 μl of KSFM. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and then added to a 50% confluent culture of primary human epidermal keratinocyte maintained in 2 ml of KSFM in a 9.6-cm2 dish. For co-transfection experiments, with 0.5 μg of p21Cip1 promoter reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of PKCδ expression plasmid were mixed, treated with FuGENE 6, and added to cells as indicated above. After 24 h, the cells were harvested, and the extracts were prepared for assay of luciferase activity. Keratinocytes were electroporated with siRNA or plasmids using the Amaxa electroporator and the VPD-1002 nucleofection kit (Germany). For electroporation, keratinocytes were harvested with trypsin and replated 1 day prior to use. On the day of electroporation, 1 × 106 of the replated cells were harvested with trypsin and resuspended in KSFM. The cells are collected at 2000 rpm, washed with 1 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5), and suspended in 100 μl of keratinocyte nucleofection solution. The cell suspension, which included 3 μg of gene-specific siRNA, was mixed by gentle pipetting and electroporated using the T-018 settings. Warm KSFM (500 μl) was added, and the suspension was transferred to a 21.3-cm2 cell culture dish containing 3.5 ml of KSFM. When required, the cells were electroporated a second time with luciferase reporter or expression plasmid. This was accomplished by harvesting the cells with trypsin and resuspension in KSFM. The cells were collected, washed with PBS, and resuspended in nucleofection solution as above. The nucleofection suspension, which included 2 μg of plasmid, was electroporated using the T-018 settings. The cells were plated and maintained for various times before the extracts were prepared for assay. Our electroporation method delivers nucleic acid reagents with greater than 90% efficiency. Equivalent amounts of protein were electrophoresed on a 4–15% denaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked, incubated with a specific primary antibody, washed, and exposed to an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Chemiluminescent detection was used to visualize secondary antibody binding. To assess intracellular p21Cip1 distribution, total and nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent (Pierce). To monitor DNA synthesis, the cells were treated for 24 h with stimulus, and during the final 6 h prior to harvest, the cells were incubated with 10 μm BrdU. BrdU uptake was monitored in fixed cells by indirect immunofluorescence. Total RNA was isolated (Illustra RNAspin Mini kit; GE Healthcare) and reverse transcribed. Quantification was using the LightCycler 480 system (Roche Applied Science). PCR primers were designed to quantify the abundance p21Cip1 transcript using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I, and signals were normalized using cyclophilin A control primers. Primers for detection of mRNA levels are p21Cip1 (forward, 5′-AAGACCATGTGGACCTGTCACTGT-3′; reverse, 5′-AGGGCTTCCTCTTGGAGAAGATCA-3′), PKCδ (forward, 5′-GGCCACATCAAGATTGCCGACTTT-3′; reverse, 5′-ACTGGCCAATGAGCATCTCGTACA-3′), hKLF4 (forward, 5′-GAAATTCGCCCGCTCAGATGAACT-3′; reverse, 5′-TTCTCTTCTGGCAGTGTGGGTCAT-3′), and cyclophilin A (forward, 5′-CATCTGCACTGCCAAGACTGA-3′; reverse, 5′-TTCATGCCTTCTTTCACTTTGC-3′). To analyze p21Cip1 mRNA decay kinetics, keratinocytes were infected with 15 MOI of Ad5-EV or Ad5-PKCδ for 24 h prior to the addition of 5 μg/ml actinomycin D. At 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after actinomycin D addition, RNA was isolated and analyzed for p21Cip1 and cyclophilin A mRNA content by quantitative RT-PCR using primers described in the previous section. The values for each mRNA level at each time point are the means ± S.D. derived from triplicate quantitative RT-PCRs of independent samples. First order decay constants (k) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis (PRISM v3.03; GraphPad) of plots measuring the percent p21Cip1 mRNA remaining versus time of actinomycin D treatment. p21Cip1 mRNA decay constants were calculated based on the means ± S.D. of n of independent time course experiments where n = 3, permitting pair-wise statistical assessment using the Student's t test. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Human keratinocytes were infected Ad5-EV or Ad5-PKCδ adenovirus (15 MOI), and at 24 or 48 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and nuclear extract was prepared using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent (Pierce). Binding of transcription factors to p21Cip1 promoter sites was monitored by gel mobility shift assay. Five microgram of nuclear extract was incubated for 40 min at room temperature in a volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50,000 cpm radioactive, double-stranded, 32P-end labeled Sp1(1/2) site oligonucleotide (5′-GGAGGGCGGTCCCGGGCGGCGC-3′, which encodes the Sp1 and Sp2 binding sites. The Sp1-1 and Sp1-2 binding sites from the human p21Cip1 promoter region are indicated in bold and italic type (GenBank NG_009364). Although not shown, identical results were observed using a probe encoding p21Cip1 promoter Sp1 sites 3, 4, 5, and 6 (5′-GGTCCCGCCTCCTTGAGGCGGG CCCGGG CGGGGCGGTT-3′). For competition studies, a fixed molar excess of nonradioactive competitor oligonucleotide was added to the DNA binding reaction. For gel mobility supershift assay, 2 μg of Sp1, Sp3, or KLF4 factor-specific antibody was added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The 32P-labeled probe was then added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 40 min at 25 °C Protein-DNA complexes were resolved in 4% polyacrylamide gels under nondenaturing conditions. ChIP assays were conducted as described (52Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, human keratinocytes were cross-linked with 1.42% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min followed by quenching with 125 mm glycine. The cells were collected by centrifugation, and cell pellets were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing histone deacetylase inhibitors. Cross-linked cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF, 20 mm sodium butyrate, and protease inhibitors). The samples were chilled on ice, and DNA was sheared using a Branson Sonifier (three 30-s pulses on ice at 40% amplitude with 30 s between pulses) to produce fragments of 1,000 bp. Radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (400 μl) containing protease inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors was added, and the chromatin was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots were used for generating input DNA and for antibody immunoprecipitation. ChIP grade antibodies were added to Dynabeads protein A and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation at 40 rpm. Sheared chromatin was added, and mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight with rotation. The chromatin-antibody complex was washed twice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and 40 μl of Chelex 100 slurry (10% w/v) was added to the washed beads, and samples were boiled for 10 min. The samples were then treated with proteinase K for 30 min at 55 °C, and the samples were boiled for 10 min. Enrichment of KLF4-associated DNA sequences in immunoprecipitated samples and input samples was detected by quantitative RT-PCR using sequence specific primers and LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master mix. ChIP primers were as follows: p21Cip1 proximal promoter located at nucleotides −150/−4 (5′-GCTGGGCAGCCAGGAGCCTG-3′, 5′-CTGCTCACACCTCAGCTGGC-3′) and p21Cip1 distal promoter located at nucleotides −827/−673 (5′-CTGCTGCAACCACAGGGATTTCTT-3′, 5′-TGTTGATTGTCACATGCTTCCGGG-3′). Although overexpression of PKCδ in epidermis in vivo suppresses cell division (53Reddig P.J. Dreckschmidt N.E. Ahrens H. Simsiman R. Tseng C.P. Zou J. Oberley T.D. Verma A.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5710-5718PubMed Google Scholar), few studies have assessed the underlying mechanism. The present studies focus on p21Cip1 as a PKCδ target and potential mediator of growth suppression. Fig. 1A shows that PKCδ expression produces a concentration-dependent increase in p21Cip1 promoter activity. Rottlerin, a PKCδ inhibitor, inhibits this increase, but Go6976, an inhibitor of PKCα and β, does not (Fig. 1B). We next tested the impact of dominant-negative PKCδ and PKCδ-siRNA on p21Cip1 promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), expression of dominant-negative PKCδ or treatment with PKCδ-siRNA reduces p21Cip1 promoter basal activity. The immunoblot in Fig. 1E confirms a PKCδ-siRNA-dependent partial knockdown of PKCδ. We have previously shown that PKCδ-Tyr-311 phosphorylation is required for optimal PKCδ activity (31Zhu L. Brodie C. Balasubramanian S. Eckert R.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2008; 128: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of the PKCδ-Y311F mutant to increase p21Cip1 promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 1F, PKCδ-Y311F produces a reduced increase in promoter activity as compared with wild-type PKCδ. Taken together, these findings suggest that PKCδ regulates p21Cip1 expression. To assure that this regulation is biologically meaningful, we monitored the impact of PKCδ expression and knockdown on endogenous p21Cip1 mRNA and protein level. PKCδ expression increases (Fig. 2A) and PKCδ knockdown reduces p21Cip1 mRNA and protein level (Fig. 2B). To further make the case that this is transcriptional regulation and is not due to changes in mRNA stability, we monitored the impact of increased PKCδ expression on p21Cip1 mRNA turnover. Although PKCδ expression substantially increases p21Cip1 mRNA (Fig. 2A), p21Cip1 mRNA half-life is not changed in cells expressing basal versus elevated levels of PKCδ (t½ = 2.2 in Ad5-EV cells versus 1.94 in Ad5-PKCδ cells) (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these studies strongly argue that PKCδ controls p21Cip1 level via transcriptional mechanisms. It is interesting that PKCδ-siRNA reduces p21Cip1 protein level by more than 80%, indicating that tonic PKCδ activity is required to maintain endogenous p21Cip1 expression. The above studies indicate that PKCδ drives p21Cip1 expression; however, it is important to assess the impact on activity. Nuclear accumulation is an index of p21Cip1 activity (54Hwang C.Y. Lee C. Kwon K.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 3379-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A, shows that the total p21Cip1 level increases, and this is associated with increased nuclear levels. Although the increase in nuclear content is largely a response to the overall increase in p21Cip1 level, there is also an impact on subcellular distribution. This is apparent when cells are stained to assess p21Cip1 location. We detect cytoplasmic p21Cip1 in 96% of Ad5-EV-infected cells. This cytoplasmic staining is evident in the upper panels of Fig. 3B. In contrast, in Ad5-PKCδ infected cells, cytoplasmic staining is observed in only 1% of cells (lower panels). This consistent observation suggests that in addition to increasing p21Cip1 level, PKCδ promotes movement into the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 3C, these changes are associated with a reduction in BrdU incorporation from 45.2% in empty virus-infected to 1.3% in PKCδ-expressing cells, indicative of reduced cell proliferation in the presence of increased PKCδ. To study the mechanism of the PKCδ-dependent increase in p21Cip1 expression, we sought to identify PKCδ response elements in the p21Cip1 promoter. The p21Cip1 promoter upstream regulatory region encodes six GC-rich sites in the proximal promoter that are reported to bind Sp1 transcription factors (Sp1, Sp2, etc.), and two p53 binding sites in the distal promoter (Fig. 4A) (55Ocker M. Schneider-Stock R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 1367-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We constructed a p21Cip1 promoter truncation series and monitored the ability of PKCδ to activate expression of each construct. As shown in Fig. 4B, PKCδ produces a three-peak pattern of promoter activation. To"
https://openalex.org/W1964895264,"Fibronectin (FN) is an extracellular matrix protein that is assembled into fibrils by cells during tissue morphogenesis and wound healing. FN matrix fibrils are highly elastic, but the mechanism of elasticity has been debated: it may be achieved by mechanical unfolding of FN-III domains or by a conformational change of the molecule without domain unfolding. Here, we investigate the folded state of FN-III domains in FN fibrils by measuring the accessibility of buried cysteines. Four of the 15 FN-III domains (III-2, -3, -9, and -11) appear to unfold in both stretched fibrils and in solution, suggesting that these domains spontaneously open and close even in the absence of tension. Two FN-III domains (III-6 and -12) appear to unfold only in fibrils and not in solution. These results suggest that domain unfolding can at best contribute partially to the 4-fold extensibility of fibronectin fibrils.

IntroductionFibronectin (FN) 2The abbreviations used are: FNfibronectinCPM7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarinFN-Itype I domain of fibronectinNnewtons. is a dimer of a 250-kDa protein that forms insoluble fibrils that are a critical component of the extracellular matrix. It is made up of a series of three domain types connected end-to-end (see Fig. 1A) (1Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15 (discussion 321): 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The N terminus of FN consists of nine FN-I and two FN-II domains, each of which contains an internal disulfide bond. The C terminus of FN consists of three FN-I domains and contains intermolecular disulfides that link the two FN monomers to form the dimer. The central portion of the FN molecule is made up of 15 tandem FN-III domains; these domains each consist of seven β-strands folded into a β-sandwich structure and contain no internal disulfides (see Fig. 1B). FN in solution adopts a compact conformation in which the second to fourth FN-III domains (III-2–4) of one subunit interact with the 12th to 14th FN-III domains (III-12–14) of the other, causing the FN dimer to fold onto itself (see Fig. 1A) (2Johnson K.J. Sage H. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15473-15479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).FN interacts with both cells and other extracellular matrix proteins. The N-terminal domains contain binding sites for the extracellular matrix proteins collagen and fibrin, whereas the ninth and tenth FN-III domains bind to integrins at the cell surface (3Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3841) Google Scholar, 4Fogerty F.J. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Mosher D.F. J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Upon attachment to cells, FN is stretched and assembled into fibrils by cell contraction: matrix assembly is inhibited if cell contractility is inhibited (7Zhong C. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Brown J. Shaub A. Belkin A.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) or if tension within the matrix is released (8Halliday N.L. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of FN fibril formation is still unknown, studies have shown that FN fibrils are stretched to up to 4 times their resting length by cells and are highly elastic structures (9Ohashi T. Kiehart D.P. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2153-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 10Ohashi T. Kiehart D.P. Erickson H.P. J.

This elasticity requires cell contraction; disruption of cytoskeletal contraction relaxes stretched fibrils (10Ohashi T. Kiehart D.P. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Two different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the elasticity of FN matrix fibrils (see Fig. 1A) (13Erickson H.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2002; 23: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). One theory contends that the elasticity is a function of FN-III domains unfolding under tension (see Fig. 1A, mechanism 2) (14Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10114-10118Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 15Smith M.L. Gourdon D. Little W.C. Kubow K.E. Eguiluz R.A. Luna-Morris S. Vogel V. PLOS Biol. 2007; 5: e268Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). These domains contain no internal disulfides and can be mechanically unfolded by atomic force microscopy (16Oberhauser A.F. Badilla-Fernandez C. Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 17Abu-Lail N.I. Ohashi T. Clark R.L. Erickson H.P. Zauscher S. Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is unclear how relevant these atomic force microscopy pulling forces are to the in vivo assembly of fibrils; the unfolding by atomic force microscopy occurred at high forces on the order of 100 pN, due to high pulling rates. In cell-assembled fibrils, the pulling speed is nearly zero, so it is difficult to extrapolate the cell-applied force that would be needed to unfold these domains. In addition to mechanical unfolding of FN-III domains, transient opening of certain FN-III domains has been demonstrated in the absence of applied force during the assembly of in vitro assembled super-fibronectin (18Ohashi T. Augustus A. Erickson H. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4189-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39143-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The second theory to explain fibril elasticity contends that FN molecules are in a compact conformation in relaxed fibrils and are stretched to the extended conformation in elongated fibrils (see Fig. 1A, mechanism 1) (20Erickson H.P. Carrell N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14539-14544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two mechanisms are not exclusive; elasticity of fibrils may be a combination of the two.In the current study, we have investigated the folded state of FN-III domains by assaying exposure of buried free cysteines, as was done previously to examine the folded state of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin (21Johnson C.P. Tang H.Y. Carag C. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Science. 2007; 317: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In this assay, proteins containing free cysteines (i.e. not in a disulfide bond) buried within certain domains are probed with a thiol-reactive dye. If the domain has opened, then the cysteine will be exposed to the dye, but if the domain remains folded, the buried cysteine will be blocked from labeling. Here, we use thiol-reactive dyes to investigate the folded state of FN-III domains both in stretched fibrils, where FN is subjected to cellular forces, and in solution, where relaxed FN is subjected to no external stretch.DISCUSSIONWe investigated the unfolding of FN-III domains in FN by introducing buried free cysteines and measuring their exposure with thiol-reactive dyes in both FN matrix fibrils (assembled and stretched by cells) and in solution (in the absence of force). Successful labeling of buried cysteines indicated that domains were opened sufficiently to allow chemical attachment of the thiol reagent. In the original application of the buried thiol labeling approach, Johnson et al. (21Johnson C.P. Tang H.Y. Carag C. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Science. 2007; 317: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) labeled red blood cell ghosts with IAEDANS; the cells were either static in solution or subjected to shear. The sheared cells showed 50% more labeling of spectrin, whereas other cytoskeletal proteins showed no change. Six shear-sensitive cysteines were identified; two of these cysteines were tested in folded domains in solution, and their reactivity to IAEDANS closely followed their denaturation with increasing temperature. This suggested that a buried cysteine became susceptible to labeling only upon denaturation of the domain and that shear caused an equivalent force-induced unfolding.Our work reveals an additional nuance of the technique: in some FN-III domains, the apparently buried cysteine was exposed to labeling when the isolated domain was assayed in solution. One possibility is that the cysteine is not actually buried but instead remains surface exposed. This seems unlikely since the corresponding residue is buried in known FN-III domain structures. Additionally, with the exception of III-1, the labeling was 2–9-fold slower than for the exposed cysteine on BSA. We suggest that these domains are actually folded, as indicated by tryptophan fluorescence, but are transiently unfolding and refolding. We previously suggested that domains III-1, III-2, III-3, and III-11 transiently open and bind anastellin, a fragment of domain III-1, when forming the in vitro induced FN matrix known as superfibronectin (18Ohashi T. Augustus A. Erickson H. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4189-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39143-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We suggest that the labeling of the buried cysteine in these domains, and in III-9, occurs during this transient opening.In addition to the four domains that were labeled in both solution and stretched fibrils, three domains showed situation-specific labeling. Domain III-1 was significantly labeled in solution in the absence of tension; however, there was no apparent labeling in stretched fibrils. One possible explanation is that domain III-1 is opened in fibrils, but the cysteine becomes buried in an FN–FN bond. Previous work has implicated III-1 in FN fibril assembly (27Chernousov M.A. Faerman A.I. Frid M.G. Printseva OYu Koteliansky V.E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Sechler J.L. Rao H. Cumiskey A.M. Vega-Colón I. Smith M.S. Murata T. Schwarzbauer J.E. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19183-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, domains III-6 and III-12 showed no labeling in solution but showed significant labeling in stretched fibrils, suggesting that these domains are unfolded specifically in matrix fibrils. This unfolding could be induced by either the assembly of FN into fibrils or the mechanical stretching of fibrils.These results suggest that nine of the 15 FN-III domains do not unfold and thus do not contribute to the 4-fold extensibility of FN fibrils. The other six FN-III domains may contribute to this extensibility; however, this depends on two unanswered questions: 1) to what degree are these domains extended and 2) where do the FN-FN intermolecular bonds occur in fibrils. If one assumes that FN-FN bonds occur at the 70-kDa N-terminal region, which has been shown to be involved in FN fibrillogenesis (30McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 31Sottile J. Schwarzbauer J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12840-12843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that FN molecules are connected end-to-end, then the region containing the FN-III domains would make up roughly 50% of the FN contour length (Fig. 7A). Thus, a 4-fold stretch of FN would require an 8-fold stretch of the FN-III domain region. Because each domain is a seven-strand β-sandwich, this would mean that all FN-III domains would need to be stretched to their full contour length; in this scenario, the six domains that open could account for maximally 40% of the observed stretch, and only if each domain was completely unfolded and fully extended. However, if one assumes that FN-FN bonds occur immediately adjacent to the FN-III domain region, then this region would only need to stretch 4-fold (Fig. 7A). If each of the six domains that open were stretched to their full contour length, then the resulting fibril would have an ∼3-fold extensibility, which is on the order of magnitude of the observed fibril stretch. However, this would again require that these domains be stretched to their full contour length.FIGURE 7Estimating the potential contribution of FN-III domain unfolding to fibril elasticity. The contribution of FN-III domain unfolding to fibril elasticity depends on both the location of FN-FN bonds in fibrils as well as the degree of extension in the unfolded domains. A, effect of the location of FN-FN binding sites: if FN-FN interactions are at the extreme ends of the molecule, then all FN-III domains must completely unfold to their fully extended length. If binding is at the end of the FN-III region, then roughly half of the domains must unfold to their fully extended length. B, an unfolded domain can be modeled as a 90-amino acid unstructured polypeptide. The force required to extend this polypeptide can be predicted using the worm-like chain model.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The degree of unfolding in the opened domains is subject to two conditions. First, the tension needs to be sufficient to prevent domain refolding. Carrion-Vasquez et al. (32Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that an Ig domain unfolded by force will spontaneously refold even while subjected to a continuous tension. For the particular I27 domain they studied, Li et al. (33Li H. Linke W.A. Oberhauser A.F. Carrion-Vazquez M. Kerkvliet J.G. Lu H. Marszalek P.E. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) calculated that a force of 13.7 pN would cause 50% of the domains to be unfolded. This is a high force relative to the ∼5 pN generated by myosin motor molecules. The force for blocking domain refolding will likely depend on the parameters for each domain, which are not known for FN-III domains. It is worth keeping in mind, however, that domains will tend to refold even against a tensile force.Even for a domain that has been unfolded, extending it to a stretched conformation will require force, because the unstructured polypeptide will act as an entropic spring. This is usually modeled as a worm-like chain, where the entropic force is given as a function of the end-to-end distance (34Bustamante C. Marko J.F. Siggia E.D. Smith S. Science. 1994; 265: 1599-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar, 35Bouchiat C. Wang M.D. Allemand J. Strick T. Block S.M. Croquette V. Biophys.

Using a persistence length of 0.6 nm, we can predict the force needed to extend a 90-amino acid unstructured polypeptide, which is the length of a typical FN-III domain (Fig. 7B). The force of 15 pN, which is needed to prevent refolding, would stretch the polypeptide to 60% of its contour length. For a domain subjected to a 5 pN force, the peptide would only have an approximate 30% extension. These extensions are significantly less than the complete, 7-fold extension that would be necessary to explain 4-fold stretch that is observed in FN fibrils. Thus, we conclude that the unfolding of domains III-2, III-3, III-6, III-9, III-11, and III-12 can only account for a fraction of the observed extensibility of FN fibrils. The majority of fibril elongation would have to be produced by global conformational changes of the entire FN molecule. IntroductionFibronectin (FN) 2The abbreviations used are: FNfibronectinCPM7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarinFN-Itype I domain of fibronectinNnewtons. is a dimer of a 250-kDa protein that forms insoluble fibrils that are a critical component of the extracellular matrix. It is made up of a series of three domain types connected end-to-end (see Fig. 1A) (1Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15 (discussion 321): 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The N terminus of FN consists of nine FN-I and two FN-II domains, each of which contains an internal disulfide bond. The C terminus of FN consists of three FN-I domains and contains intermolecular disulfides that link the two FN monomers to form the dimer. The central portion of the FN molecule is made up of 15 tandem FN-III domains; these domains each consist of seven β-strands folded into a β-sandwich structure and contain no internal disulfides (see Fig. 1B). FN in solution adopts a compact conformation in which the second to fourth FN-III domains (III-2–4) of one subunit interact with the 12th to 14th FN-III domains (III-12–14) of the other, causing the FN dimer to fold onto itself (see Fig. 1A) (2Johnson K.J. Sage H. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15473-15479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).FN interacts with both cells and other extracellular matrix proteins. The N-terminal domains contain binding sites for the extracellular matrix proteins collagen and fibrin, whereas the ninth and tenth FN-III domains bind to integrins at the cell surface (3Ruoslahti E.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Upon attachment to cells, FN is stretched and assembled into fibrils by cell contraction: matrix assembly is inhibited if cell contractility is inhibited (7Zhong C. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Brown J. Shaub A. Belkin A.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) or if tension within the matrix is released (8Halliday N.L. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of FN fibril formation is still unknown, studies have shown that FN fibrils are stretched to up to 4 times their resting length by cells and are highly elastic structures (9Ohashi T. Kiehart D.P. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2153-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 10Ohashi T. Kiehart D.P. Erickson H.P. J.

This elasticity requires cell contraction; disruption of cytoskeletal contraction relaxes stretched fibrils (10Ohashi T. Kiehart D.P. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Two different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the elasticity of FN matrix fibrils (see Fig. 1A) (13Erickson H.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2002; 23: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). One theory contends that the elasticity is a function of FN-III domains unfolding under tension (see Fig. 1A, mechanism 2) (14Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10114-10118Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 15Smith M.L. Gourdon D. Little W.C. Kubow K.E. Eguiluz R.A. Luna-Morris S. Vogel V. PLOS Biol. 2007; 5: e268Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). These domains contain no internal disulfides and can be mechanically unfolded by atomic force microscopy (16Oberhauser A.F. Badilla-Fernandez C. Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 17Abu-Lail N.I. Ohashi T. Clark R.L. Erickson H.P. Zauscher S. Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is unclear how relevant these atomic force microscopy pulling forces are to the in vivo assembly of fibrils; the unfolding by atomic force microscopy occurred at high forces on the order of 100 pN, due to high pulling rates. In cell-assembled fibrils, the pulling speed is nearly zero, so it is difficult to extrapolate the cell-applied force that would be needed to unfold these domains. In addition to mechanical unfolding of FN-III domains, transient opening of certain FN-III domains has been demonstrated in the absence of applied force during the assembly of in vitro assembled super-fibronectin (18Ohashi T. Augustus A. Erickson H. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4189-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol.

Carrell N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14539-14544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two mechanisms are not exclusive; elasticity of fibrils may be a combination of the two.In the current study, we have investigated the folded state of FN-III domains by assaying exposure of buried free cysteines, as was done previously to examine the folded state of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin (21Johnson C.P. Tang H.Y. Carag C. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Science. 2007; 317: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In this assay, proteins containing free cysteines (i.e. not in a disulfide bond) buried within certain domains are probed with a thiol-reactive dye. If the domain has opened, then the cysteine will be exposed to the dye, but if the domain remains folded, the buried cysteine will be blocked from labeling. Here, we use thiol-reactive dyes to investigate the folded state of FN-III domains both in stretched fibrils, where FN is subjected to cellular forces, and in solution, where relaxed FN is subjected to no external stretch.

In the current study, we have investigated the folded state of FN-III domains by assaying exposure of buried free cysteines, as was done previously to examine the folded state of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin (21Johnson C.P.

In this assay, proteins containing free cysteines (i.e. not in a disulfide bond) buried within certain domains are probed with a thiol-reactive dye. If the domain has opened, then the cysteine will be exposed to the dye, but if the domain remains folded, the buried cysteine will be blocked from labeling. Here, we use thiol-reactive dyes to investigate the folded state of FN-III domains both in stretched fibrils, where FN is subjected to cellular forces, and in solution, where relaxed FN is subjected to no external stretch. DISCUSSIONWe investigated the unfolding of FN-III domains in FN by introducing buried free cysteines and measuring their exposure with thiol-reactive dyes in both FN matrix fibrils (assembled and stretched by cells) and in solution (in the absence of force). Successful labeling of buried cysteines indicated that domains were opened sufficiently to allow chemical attachment of the thiol reagent. In the original application of the buried thiol labeling approach, Johnson et al. (21Johnson C.P. Tang H.Y. Carag C. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Science. 2007; 317: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) labeled red blood cell ghosts with IAEDANS; the cells were either static in solution or subjected to shear. The sheared cells showed 50% more labeling of spectrin, whereas other cytoskeletal proteins showed no change. Six shear-sensitive cysteines were identified; two of these cysteines were tested in folded domains in solution, and their reactivity to IAEDANS closely followed their denaturation with increasing temperature. This suggested that a buried cysteine became susceptible to labeling only upon denaturation of the domain and that shear caused an equivalent force-induced unfolding.Our work reveals an additional nuance of the technique: in some FN-III domains, the apparently buried cysteine was exposed to labeling when the isolated domain was assayed in solution. One possibility is that the cysteine is not actually buried but instead remains surface exposed. This seems unlikely since the corresponding residue is buried in known FN-III domain structures. Additionally, with the exception of III-1, the labeling was 2–9-fold slower than for the exposed cysteine on BSA. We suggest that these domains are actually folded, as indicated by tryptophan fluorescence, but are transiently unfolding and refolding. We previously suggested that domains III-1, III-2, III-3, and III-11 transiently open and bind anastellin, a fragment of domain III-1, when forming the in vitro induced FN matrix known as superfibronectin (18Ohashi T. Augustus A. Erickson H. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4189-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39143-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We suggest that the labeling of the buried cysteine in these domains, and in III-9, occurs during this transient opening.In addition to the four domains that were labeled in both solution and stretched fibrils, three domains showed situation-specific labeling. Domain III-1 was significantly labeled in solution in the absence of tension; however, there was no apparent labeling in stretched fibrils. One possible explanation is that domain III-1 is opened in fibrils, but the cysteine becomes buried in an FN–FN bond. Previous work has implicated III-1 in FN fibril assembly (27Chernousov M.A. Faerman A.I. Frid M.G. Printseva OYu Koteliansky V.E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Sechler J.L. Rao H. Cumiskey A.M. Vega-Colón I. Smith M.S. Murata T. Schwarzbauer J.E. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19183-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, domains III-6 and III-12 showed no labeling in solution but showed significant labeling in stretched fibrils, suggesting that these domains are unfolded specifically in matrix fibrils. This unfolding could be induced by either the assembly of FN into fibrils or the mechanical stretching of fibrils.These results suggest that nine of the 15 FN-III domains do not unfold and thus do not contribute to the 4-fold extensibility of FN fibrils. The other six FN-III domains may contribute to this extensibility; however, this depends on two unanswered questions: 1) to what degree are these domains extended and 2) where do the FN-FN intermolecular bonds occur in fibrils. If one assumes that FN-FN bonds occur at the 70-kDa N-terminal region, which has been shown to be involved in FN fibrillogenesis (30McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 31Sottile J. Schwarzbauer J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12840-12843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that FN molecules are connected end-to-end, then the region containing the FN-III domains would make up roughly 50% of the FN contour length (Fig. 7A). Thus, a 4-fold stretch of FN would require an 8-fold stretch of the FN-III domain region. Because each domain is a seven-strand β-sandwich, this would mean that all FN-III domains would need to be stretched to their full contour length; in this scenario, the six domains that open could account for maximally 40% of the observed stretch, and only if each domain was completely unfolded and fully extended. However, if one assumes that FN-FN bonds occur immediately adjacent to the FN-III domain region, then this region would only need to stretch 4-fold (Fig. 7A). If each of the six domains that open were stretched to their full contour length, then the resulting fibril would have an ∼3-fold extensibility, which is on the order of magnitude of the observed fibril stretch. However, this would again require that these domains be stretched to their full contour length.The degree of unfolding in the opened domains is subject to two conditions. First, the tension needs to be sufficient to prevent domain refolding. Carrion-Vasquez et al. (32Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that an Ig domain unfolded by force will spontaneously refold even while subjected to a continuous tension. For the particular I27 domain they studied, Li et al. (33Li H. Linke W.A. Oberhauser A.F. Carrion-Vazquez M. Kerkvliet J.G. Lu H. Marszalek P.E. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) calculated that a force of 13.7 pN would cause 50% of the domains to be unfolded. This is a high force relative to the ∼5 pN generated by myosin motor molecules. The force for blocking domain refolding will likely depend on the parameters for each domain, which are not known for FN-III domains. It is worth keeping in mind, however, that domains will tend to refold even against a tensile force.Even for a domain that has been unfolded, extending it to a stretched conformation will require force, because the unstructured polypeptide will act as an entropic spring. This is usually modeled as a worm-like chain, where the entropic force is given as a function of the end-to-end distance (34Bustamante C. Marko J.F. Siggia E.D. Smith S.

Using a persistence length of 0.6 nm, we can predict the force needed to extend a 90-amino acid unstructured polypeptide, which is the length of a typical FN-III domain (Fig. 7B). The force of 15 pN, which is needed to prevent refolding, would stretch the polypeptide to 60% of its contour length. For a domain subjected to a 5 pN force, the peptide would only have an approximate 30% extension. These extensions are significantly less than the complete, 7-fold extension that would be necessary to explain 4-fold stretch that is observed in FN fibrils. Thus, we conclude that the unfolding of domains III-2, III-3, III-6, III-9, III-11, and III-12 can only account for a fraction of the observed extensibility of FN fibrils. The majority of fibril elongation would have to be produced by global conformational changes of the entire FN molecule. We investigated the unfolding of FN-III domains in FN by introducing buried free cysteines and measuring their exposure with thiol-reactive dyes in both FN matrix fibrils (assembled and stretched by cells) and in solution (in the absence of force). Successful labeling of buried cysteines indicated that domains were opened sufficiently to allow chemical attachment of the thiol reagent. In the original application of the buried thiol labeling approach, Johnson et al. (21Johnson C.P. Tang H.Y. Carag C. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Science. 2007; 317: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) labeled red blood cell ghosts with IAEDANS; the cells were either static in solution or subjected to shear. The sheared cells showed 50% more labeling of spectrin, whereas other cytoskeletal proteins showed no change. Six shear-sensitive cysteines were identified; two of these cysteines were tested in folded domains in solution, and their reactivity to IAEDANS closely followed their denaturation with increasing temperature. This suggested that a buried cysteine became susceptible to labeling only upon denaturation of the domain and that shear caused an equivalent force-induced unfolding. Our work reveals an additional nuance of the technique: in some FN-III domains, the apparently buried cysteine was exposed to labeling when the isolated domain was assayed in solution. One possibility is that the cysteine is not actually buried but instead remains surface exposed. This seems unlikely since the corresponding residue is buried in known FN-III domain structures. Additionally, with the exception of III-1, the labeling was 2–9-fold slower than for the exposed cysteine on BSA. We suggest that these domains are actually folded, as indicated by tryptophan fluorescence, but are transiently unfolding and refolding. We previously suggested that domains III-1, III-2, III-3, and III-11 transiently open and bind anastellin, a fragment of domain III-1, when forming the in vitro induced FN matrix known as superfibronectin (18Ohashi T. Augustus A. Erickson H. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4189-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39143-39151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We suggest that the labeling of the buried cysteine in these domains, and in III-9, occurs during this transient opening. In addition to the four domains that were labeled in both solution and stretched fibrils, three domains showed situation-specific labeling. Domain III-1 was significantly labeled in solution in the absence of tension; however, there was no apparent labeling in stretched fibrils. One possible explanation is that domain III-1 is opened in fibrils, but the cysteine becomes buried in an FN–FN bond. Previous work has implicated III-1 in FN fibril assembly (27Chernousov M.A. Faerman A.I. Frid M.G. Printseva OYu Koteliansky V.E. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Sechler J.L. Rao H. Cumiskey A.M. Vega-Colón I. Smith M.S. Murata T. Schwarzbauer J.E. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19183-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, domains III-6 and III-12 showed no labeling in solution but showed significant labeling in stretched fibrils, suggesting that these domains are unfolded specifically in matrix fibrils. This unfolding could be induced by either the assembly of FN into fibrils or the mechanical stretching of fibrils. These results suggest that nine of the 15 FN-III domains do not unfold and thus do not contribute to the 4-fold extensibility of FN fibrils. The other six FN-III domains may contribute to this extensibility; however, this depends on two unanswered questions: 1) to what degree are these domains extended and 2) where do the FN-FN intermolecular bonds occur in fibrils. If one assumes that FN-FN bonds occur at the 70-kDa N-terminal region, which has been shown to be involved in FN fibrillogenesis (30McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J.

In a Th2 cytokine-driven mouse asthma model, deficiency of mouse GX (mGX)-sPLA2 significantly impairs development of the asthma phenotype. In this study, we generated mGX-sPLA2−/− mice with knock-in of human GX (hGX)-sPLA2 (i.e. hGX-sPLA2+/+ knock-in mice) to understand more fully the role of GX-sPLA2 in these allergic pulmonary responses and to assess the effect of pharmacological blockade of the GX-sPLA2-mediated responses. Knock-in of hGX-sPLA2 in mGX-sPLA2−/− mice restored the allergen-induced airway infiltration by inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, goblet cell metaplasia, and hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in the mGX-sPLA2-deficient mice. This knock-in mouse model enabled the use of a highly potent indole-based inhibitor of hGX-sPLA2, RO061606 (which is ineffective against mGX-sPLA2), to assess the potential utility of GX-sPLA2 blockade as a therapeutic intervention in asthma.

The liberation of arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of cell membrane phospholipids by phospholipases A2 for the biosynthesis of eicosanoids (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and others) is a well established process. Studies with genetically altered mice and small molecular weight inhibitors have established that cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α 3The abbreviations used are: cPLA2αcytosolic phospholipase A2αsPLA2secreted PLA2GXgroup XmGXmouse GXhGXhuman GXOVAovalbuminBALbronchoalveolar lavage. ; group IVA PLA2) can mediate arachidonate release, leading to eicosanoids in a variety of mammalian cells stimulated with a diverse set of agonists (1Ghosh M. Tucker D.E. Burchett S.A. Leslie C.C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 487-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). There are five other isoforms of this enzyme, but the physiological functions of these isoforms have not been established. The mammalian genome also encodes a large number of secreted PLA2s (sPLA2s) (2Valentin E. Lambeau G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The functions of most of these enzymes are not yet known, but increasing evidence supports a role of the group X (GX) sPLA2 in arachidonate release, leading to eicosanoids. cytosolic phospholipase A2α secreted PLA2 group X mouse GX human GX ovalbumin bronchoalveolar lavage. In a mouse model of asthma that is driven by Th2 cytokines, we found a major effect of mouse GX (mGX)-sPLA2 deficiency (3Henderson Jr., W.R. Chi E.Y. Bollinger J.G. Tien Y.T. Ye X. Castelli L.

In this initial study of allergen (i.e. ovalbumin (OVA))-induced airway inflammation in the mGX-sPLA2-deficient mouse, OVA-treated mGX-sPLA2−/− mice compared with wild-type mice had a marked reduction in interstitial edema and the influx of eosinophils and other inflammatory cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, into the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue. Whereas mGX-sPLA2+/+ mice had significant airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine and remodeling, including goblet cell metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion after OVA challenge, these features of the asthma phenotype were not present in mGX-sPLA2−/− mice (3Henderson Jr., W.R. Chi E.Y. Bollinger J.G. Tien Y.T. Ye X. Castelli L. Rubtsov Y.P. Singer A.G. Chiang G.K. Nevalainen T. Rudensky A.Y. Gelb M.H. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 865-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Th2 cytokine expression is a molecular hallmark of asthma. Levels of Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in the lungs were decreased in mGX-sPLA2−/− mice compared with wild-type controls after OVA treatment. Furthermore, the cyclooxygenase products prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin D2 and the 5-lipoxygenase products leukotriene B4 and cysteinyl leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 of arachidonic acid metabolism were significantly reduced in mGX-sPLA2−/− mice after OVA treatment compared with wild-type controls (3Henderson Jr., W.R.

Med. 2007; 204: 865-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These data indicated that mGX-sPLA2 plays a key role in eicosanoid generation and that the decreased release of arachidonate metabolites secondary to mGX-sPLA2 deficiency impairs the Th2 responses in this asthma model. Thus, development of a selective GX-sPLA2 inhibitor may be a novel therapeutic intervention in asthma. We have begun to study inflammatory cells in culture to better understand how GX-sPLA2 is involved in eicosanoid biosynthesis, including an understanding of how it augments arachidonate release along with cPLA2α. Addition of human GX (hGX)-sPLA2 exogenously to primary human eosinophils leads to cysteinyl leukotriene production in a process that involves an increase in intracellular calcium and activation of MAPK and cPLA2α (4Lai Y. Oslund R.C. Bollinger J.G. Henderson Jr., W.R. Santana L.F. Altemeier W.A. Gelb M.H. Hallstrand T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41491-41500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms for this hGX-sPLA2/cPLA2α interaction remain to be elucidated, but these cellular studies support our mouse studies, which demonstrate a role of mGX-sPLA2 in eicosanoid formation and airway inflammation in a mouse model of allergic asthma. In this study, we wanted to take a pharmacological approach to block the action of GX-sPLA2 in a mouse asthma model. This requires an inhibitor that not only is selective among the full set of mammalian sPLA2s but also has sufficiently good pharmacokinetic properties to be used over several days in the mouse asthma model. In our previous work, we synthesized a large number of analogs of the indole-based sPLA2 inhibitors developed by workers at Eli Lilly and Co. (5Oslund R.C. Cermak N. Gelb M.H. J. Med. Chem. 2008; 51: 4708-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In that study, we discovered a highly potent inhibitor that is specific for hGX-sPLA2. This compound unfortunately does not inhibit mGX-sPLA2 for reasons that are apparent from the examination of the x-ray crystal structure of related inhibitors bound to hGX-sPLA2 (5Oslund R.C. Cermak N. Gelb M.H. J. Med. Chem. 2008; 51: 4708-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Smart B.P. Pan Y.H. Weeks A.K. Bollinger J.G. Bahnson B.J. Gelb M.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004; 12: 1737-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, in this study, we generated a mouse that expresses hGX-sPLA2 instead of mGX-sPLA2 under the control of the mGX-sPLA2 promoter. In a genetic knock-out, the level of GX-sPLA2 is reduced to zero, and this may be an unrealistic achievement using a small molecular weight inhibitor of the enzyme. Thus, it is interesting to compare results obtained by pharmacological blockade with those obtained in the knock-out. In addition to allowing us to test our hGX-sPLA2-selective inhibitor in a mouse model of allergic asthma, the hGX-sPLA2 knock-in mouse would allow us to test if the airway inflammation that is lost in mGX-sPLA2−/− mice is recovered after introduction of the human enzyme. Genetic knock-outs contain genome elements near the knock-out site from the mouse strain used to generate the gene disruption (129/SvEvBrd in this case), and it is always possible that the phenotype of the mGX-sPLA2−/− mouse is controlled, at least in part, by genome differences between inbred strains of mouse around the GX-sPLA2 locus. In this study, we found that hGX-sPLA2 can rescue the loss in airway inflammation seen in the mGX-sPLA2−/− mouse. In addition, our highly potent inhibitor of hGX-sPLA2, RO061606, significantly reduced allergen-induced airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in a mouse model of asthma. These results indicate that hGX-sPLA2 is an important target amenable for the development of novel anti-asthma drugs. The hGX-specific sPLA2 inhibitor RO061606 was prepared as described (compound 12b) by Oslund et al. (5Oslund R.C. Cermak N. Gelb M.H. J. Med. Chem. 2008; 51: 4708-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recombinant sPLA2s were prepared as described previously (5Oslund R.C. Cermak N. Gelb M.H. J. Med. Chem. 2008; 51: 4708-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Pharmacokinetic studies of RO061606 were carried out following the procedure described by Kraus et al. (7Kraus J.M.

The compound was dissolved in 5% Me2SO, 7% Tween 80, and 3% EtOH in sterile PBS at 5 mm. Wild-type mGX-sPLA2+/+ C57BL/6J mice (6–8 weeks old) were dosed intraperitoneally at 20 mg of drug/kg of mouse with a volume of 300 μl. At timed intervals of 30, 60, 120, and 360 min, 40 μl of tail blood was collected using a capillary tube. The plasma was isolated from the blood by centrifugation, collected, and stored at −80 °C until analysis by LC-MS as described below. To verify that the minipump drug delivery method would provide suitable for drug plasma concentrations, RO061606 plasma concentrations in wild-type C57BL/6J mice dosed via ALZET® Model 2001 mini-osmotic pumps (DURECT Corp., Cupertino, CA) were assessed over a 116-h period. Drug-filled pumps (45 mm RO061606 in 1:1 Me2SO/propylene glycol, with the compound dissolved first in Me2SO, followed by addition of propylene glycol) were inserted subcutaneously in mice at two pumps per mouse, and mouse tail blood (∼40 μl) was collected at timed intervals of 6, 24, 72, 96, and 116 h with a capillary tube. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Frozen plasma samples from drug-treated mice were thawed at room temperature and gently stirred on a Vortex mixer; 10 μl of plasma was removed and transferred to a 500-μl Eppendorf tube, followed by addition of 11 μl of acetonitrile containing 400 pmol of LY315920 (prepared as described previously (8Smart B.P. Oslund R.C. Walsh L.A. Gelb M.H. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 2858-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)) as the internal standard. The mixture was briefly vortexed, followed by addition of 30 μl of acetonitrile to the sample. The sample was again vortexed to mix all of the components and then centrifuged at 13,500 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and transferred to a new 500-μl Eppendorf tube and concentrated to dryness in a SpeedVac. The sample was then redissolved in 50 μl of 50% CH3CN and 50% H2O. The sample was vortexed and centrifuged at 13,500 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge for 5 min. Twenty-five microliters of the sample was transferred to an autosampler glass vial containing a 250-μl volume glass insert (Agilent 5183−2085), and 10 μl of this sample was analyzed by LC-MS. The LC-MS setup consisted of an Agilent HP 1100 chromatograph and a Bruker esquireLC electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer. Liquid chromatography was performed using an Agilent Zorbax SB-C18 column (3.5 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm) with a mobile phase consisting of water, 5% acetonitrile, and 1% acetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile and 1% acetic acid (solvent B). The mobile phase gradient consisted of 10% solvent B to 64% solvent B over 9 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min; the flow rate was then increased to 0.35 ml/min with a gradient from 64 to 100% solvent B over 5 min. Drug concentrations were calculated by comparing the integrated peak area of RO061606 with that of the internal standard. The response factor was corrected for by comparing the integrated peak area of a known amount of RO061606 with the integrated peak area of the internal standard. Integrations were performed using Bruker QUANT analysis software. Homozygous mGX-sPLA2-deficient mice on a C57BL/6J background were obtained by breeding mGX-sPLA2-deficient mice on a 129/SvEvBrd/C57BL/6J mixed background (9Hallstrand T.S. Chi E.Y. Singer A.G.

Finally, heterozygous mice were bred to obtain homozygous mGX-sPLA2-deficient mice. A transgenic hGX-sPLA2+/+ mouse on a C57BL/6J background in which the cDNA coding for hGX-sPLA2 is inserted into exon 1 of the mGX-sPLA2 gene was generated. This hGX-sPLA2+/+ mouse expresses hGX-sPLA2 under the control of the mGX-sPLA2 promoter. The genomic DNA sequence including the regions surrounding the hGX-sPLA2 cDNA is provided in the supplemental data. The primers used for genotyping are shown in the DNA sequence. The neomycin sequence (used for clonal selection) has been removed using Cre recombinase. After generation of the hGX-sPLA2+/+ knock-in mouse, it was bred for 10 generations with C57BL/6J mice. To explore the expression of hGX-sPLA2 in the knock-in mouse, we carried out time-resolved immunofluorescence for hGX-sPLA2 protein using a previously reported procedure (10Nevalainen T.J. Eerola L.I. Rintala E. Laine V.J. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1733: 210-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and mouse testis extracts. The amount of hGX-sPLA2 protein was measured to be 6.7 pg/mg of testis protein for the hGX-sPLA2+/+ mouse versus an assay signal corresponding to 0.9 pg/mg of testis protein in the mGX-sPLA2-deficient mouse. (The signal is slightly higher in the wild-type mouse, corresponding to 1.6 pg/mg of testis protein, presumably due to a small amount of cross-reactivity of the hGX-sPLA2-specific IgG with mGX-sPLA2 protein.) These picogram values were obtained from the observed fluorescence signals based on a standard curve prepared with known amounts of recombinant hGX-sPLA2. Wild-type mGX-sPLA2+/+ C57BL/6J mice, mGX-sPLA2-deficient C57BL/6J mice, and hGX-sPLA2+/+ mice also on a C57BL/6J background were immunized intraperitoneally with 100 μg of OVA (0.2 ml of 0.5 mg/ml) complexed with alum on days 0 and 14. Mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with 0.2–0.3 ml of ketamine (6.5 mg/ml)/xylazine (0.44 mg/ml) in normal saline before receiving an intranasal dose of 100 μg of OVA (0.05 ml of 2 mg/ml) on day 14 and 50 μg of OVA (0.05 ml of 1 mg/ml) on days 26–28. Control groups received 0.2 ml of normal saline with alum intraperitoneally on days 0 and 14 and 0.05 ml of saline without alum intranasally on days 14 and 26–28. To determine the effect of hGX inhibition in the OVA-treated hGX-sPLA2+/+ mice, RO061606 was dissolved at a concentration of 45 mm in 50% Me2SO and 50% propylene glycol by first dissolving the compound in Me2SO (ACS-grade, Fischer), followed by addition of propylene glycol (Sigma). The inhibitor solution was transferred into an ALZET® Model 2001 mini-osmotic pump following the manufacturer's instructions. The pumps were inserted subcutaneously at two pumps per hGX-sPLA2+/+ mouse on day 25 of the OVA challenge model described above. On day 29, mice from all study groups underwent pulmonary function testing for assessment of airway hyperresponsiveness to aerosolized methacholine and collection of BAL fluid and lung tissue for determination of airway inflammation, edema, and mucus hypersecretion. To verify that drug was present during the final OVA challenge phase in the hGX-sPLA2+/+ mice administered RO061606, blood from these mice was also collected on day 29 and used for LC-MS analysis as described above. On day 29 (24 h after the last intranasal challenge with OVA or saline), invasive pulmonary mechanics were measured in mice in response to methacholine as described previously (3Henderson Jr., W.R. Chi E.Y. Bollinger J.G. Tien Y.T. Ye X. Castelli L. Rubtsov Y.P. Singer A.G. Chiang G.K. Nevalainen T. Rudensky A.Y. Gelb M.H. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 865-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mice received aerosolized solutions of methacholine (0, 0.78125, 1.5625, 3.125, 6.25, and 12.5 mg/ml in normal saline), and lung resistance was determined from measures of pressure and flow and expressed as centimeters of H2O/ml/s using a commercial plethysmography system (resistance/compliance system with a Model PLY4111 plethysmograph and BioSystem XA software, Buxco Research Systems). After completion of plethysmography on day 29, the left lung was tied off at the mainstem bronchus, and the right lung was lavaged three times with 0.5 ml of normal saline. After centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, total BAL fluid cells were counted with eosinophils stained with 0.05% eosin (11Henderson Jr., W.R. Lewis D.B. Albert R.K. Zhang Y. Lamm W.J. Chiang G.K. Jones F. Eriksen P. Tien Y.T. Jonas M. Chi E.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1483-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In the OVA-treated hGX-sPLA2+/+ mouse group administered RO061606, blood was collected, and the plasma was isolated by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until analysis of drug levels. The upper and lower lobes of the left lung were fixed for 24 h in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution. The tissues were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-μm sections. For lung morphometry, 10 airways (0.4–0.7 mm in diameter and surrounded by smooth muscle cells) per mouse were randomly selected and examined by the histopathologist (Y. T. T.) blinded to the protocol design (11Henderson Jr., W.R. Lewis D.B. Albert R.K. Zhang Y. Lamm W.J. Chiang G.K. Jones F. Eriksen P. Tien Y.T. Jonas M. Chi E.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1483-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate airway total inflammatory cell infiltration (11Henderson Jr., W.R. Lewis D.B. Albert R.K. Zhang Y. Lamm W.J. Chiang G.K. Jones F. Eriksen P. Tien Y.T. Jonas M. Chi E.Y. J. Exp.

Banerjee E.R. Chi E.Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2005; 116: 332-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The sections were stained with Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff reaction to identify airway goblet cells and mucus (11Henderson Jr., W.R. Lewis D.B. Albert R.K. Zhang Y. Lamm W.J. Chiang G.K. Jones F. Eriksen P. Tien Y.T. Jonas M. Chi E.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1483-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The number of goblet cells was determined as the percent of total airway epithelial cells in each airway examined. Mucus occlusion of the airway diameter was assessed on a 0–4+ scale, with each airway section assigned a score for airway diameter occlusion by mucus as described previously (11Henderson Jr., W.R. Lewis D.B. Albert R.K. Zhang Y. Lamm W.J. Chiang G.K. Jones F. Eriksen P. Tien Y.T. Jonas M. Chi E.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1483-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We generated a transgenic mouse in which the cDNA coding for hGX-sPLA2 replaces exon 1 of the mGX-sPLA2 gene. This mouse expresses hGX-sPLA2 under the control of the mGX-sPLA2 promoter. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the expression of hGX-sPLA2 was verified in mouse testes by time-resolved immunofluorescence ELISA using an antiserum specific for this protein. The mRNA for hGX-sPLA2 was also detected by RT-PCR analysis of mouse spleen, thymus, and embryonic stem cells obtained from the hGX-sPLA2+/+ knock-in mouse (data not shown). On day 29, 24 h following the final intranasal OVA challenge in animals from each experimental group, the effect of hGX-sPLA2 knock-in on allergen-induced airway inflammation and hyperreactivity in the mGX-sPLA2-deficient mouse was determined. OVA-treated mGX-sPLA2+/+ mice had a large increase in total inflammatory cells recovered in BAL fluid compared with the saline control group (4.5 × 105/ml in OVA-treated mGX-sPLA2+/+ mice versus 0.2 × 105/ml in saline-treated controls; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1, upper panel); ∼27% of the BAL fluid cells were eosinophils in the OVA-treated mGX-sPLA2+/+ mice (Fig. 1, lower panel). As we have previously shown in mGX-sPLA2−/− mice on a mixed 129/SvEvBrd/C57BL/6J background (9Hallstrand T.S. Chi E.Y. Singer A.G. Gelb M.H. Henderson Jr., W.R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2007; 176: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the total number of inflammatory cells and eosinophils in the BAL fluid of OVA-treated mGX-sPLA2-deficient mice on a pure C57BL/6J background was significantly reduced compared with that in wild-type controls (Fig. 1). Compared with saline-treated controls (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 and supplemental Fig. 1, upper panels), a marked infiltration of inflammatory cells (eosinophils, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells) around the airways and blood vessels and interstitial edema (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 1, middle left panel) with goblet cell metaplasia and mucus occlusion of the airways (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 1, middle right panel) were observed in OVA-treated mGX-sPLA2+/+ mice. These features of allergen-driven airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion were substantially decreased in OVA-treated mGX-sPLA2−/− mice compared with wild-type mGX-sPLA2+/+ controls (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 and supplemental Fig. 1, lower panels). Knock-in of hGX-sPLA2 in the mGX-sPLA2−/− mouse restored the OVA-induced airway inflammatory responses. Compared with saline-treated controls (Fig. 4, upper left panel), the OVA-treated hGX-sPLA2+/+ mice had significantly increased total inflammatory cells and eosinophils in the BAL fluid (Fig. 1) and lung tissue (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 4) and airway edema (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 4). Airway goblet cell number and mucus release were significantly augmented in hGX-sPLA2+/+ mice after allergen treatment (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, middle right panel) compared with saline controls (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, upper right panel).FIGURE 2Restoration of allergen-induced airway inflammation and edema in mGX-sPLA2-deficient mice by hGX-sPLA2 knock-in and its blockade by RO061606.

The airways (AW) of saline-treated hGX-sPLA2+/+ mice were free of inflammatory cells (upper left panel) and mucus (upper right panel).

The sPLA2+/+ mice after OVA treatment exhibited hyperplasia of airway goblet cells (asterisks) and mucus hypersecretion (arrows), as shown in the middle right panel. The inflammatory cell infiltration (lower left panel) and mucus release (lower right panel) were markedly reduced in the OVA-treated hGX-sPLA2+/+ mice after RO061606 treatment. Scale bars = 100 μm.

Airway hyperreactivity was restored in the hGX-sPLA2+/+ mice (Fig. 5). Prior to evaluation of our hGX-sPLA2-specific inhibitor in the mouse model of allergic asthma, we needed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of the compound in mice. As shown in Fig. 6, a single intraperitoneal dose of RO061606 in C57BL/6J mice led to a peak plasma concentration of ∼40 μm, followed by a decline in inhibitor over several hours (inhibitor levels measured by LC-MS of plasma treated with acetonitrile to precipitate proteins). The mechanism of plasma clearance was not investigated. Because the allergic asthma model studied here requires multiday dosing with the allergen OVA and with the goal to maintain RO061606 in plasma at concentrations higher than ∼1 μm (well above the IC50 for inhibition of hGX-sPLA2 in vitro (5Oslund R.C. Cermak N. Gelb M.H. J. Med. Chem. 2008; 51: 4708-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)), we used implantable mini-osmotic pumps to provide continuous delivery of the inhibitor over several days. As shown in supplemental Fig. 2, when two C57BL/6J mice were dosed with RO061606 via mini-osmotic pumps, inhibitor concentrations near 10 μm were maintained in plasma for at least 5.5 days. This seems to be a reasonable dose for studies with OVA-induced airway inflammation. Approximately 90% of RO061606 was expected to be bound to serum albumin based on our observed shift in the in vitro IC50 of RO061606 for hGX-sPLA2 when albumin was present in the assay (data not shown). Thus, a dose of 10 μm represents ∼10-fold the in vitro IC50 of RO061606 for hGX-sPLA2, which should ensure that most of the enzyme is inhibited. On the basis of these data, we pursued studies of OVA-dependent airway inflammation in mice dosed over extended days with RO061606 via osmotic minipumps. To determine the effect of the hGX-sPLA2-specific inhibitor RO061606 on the asthma phenotype, RO061606 was administered to OVA-sensitized hGX-sPLA2+/+ mice beginning on day 25 prior to the intranasal OVA challenge period on days 26–28, with airway inflammation and pulmonary responsiveness assessed on day 29. The robust asthma phenotype seen in OVA-challenged hGX-sPLA2+/+ mice without RO061606 treatment as described above was markedly diminished by RO061606, with significant reductions observed in allergen-induced infiltration of the BAL fluid (Fig. 1) and lung tissue (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 4, lower left panel), airway edema (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 4, lower left panel), goblet cell metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, lower right panel), and airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (Fig. 5) by hGX-sPLA2+/+ inhibition. We also checked mice used in these experiments for the presence of RO061606 in plasma. As shown in supplemental Fig. 3, the hGX-sPLA2 inhibitor was present at 7–20 μm in plasma on day 29 in five mice. We did not test the hGX-sPLA2 inhibitor in wild-type mice, which express mGX-sPLA2. The inhibitor had some affinity for the mouse enzyme (IC50 = 2 μm) (data not shown), and thus, the presence of the inhibitor at ∼10 μm in plasma may result in some inhibition of the mouse enzyme. The use of the hGX-sPLA2+/+ mice ensured that most, if not all, of the human enzyme would be inhibited because the IC50 for the human enzyme is 50 nm. Higher sPLA2 activity is present in the BAL fluid of asthmatics compared with controls (13Triggiani M. Giannattasio G. Calabrese C. Loffredo S. Granata F. Fiorello A. Santini M. Gelb M.H. Marone G. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2009; 124 (565.e1–3): 558-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and sPLA2 activity increases in the nasal lavage fluid (14Stadel J.M.

Care Med. 1997; 155: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) of asthmatic patients after specific allergen challenge. In recent studies to identify the sPLA2s associated with asthma, we found that the sPLA2 activity in the BAL fluid of asthmatics was primarily either GX-sPLA2 or GIIA-sPLA2 (17Hallstrand T.S. Lai Y. Ni Z. Oslund R.C. Henderson Jr., W.R. Gelb M.H. Wenzel S.E. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of GX-sPLA2, but not GIIA-sPLA2, correlated with asthma severity, airway inflammation (sputum neutrophils), and eicosanoid release (BAL fluid prostaglandin E2); greater expression of GX-sPLA2 compared with other sPLA2s (GIIA-sPLA2 and GV-sPLA2) was also detected in the airway epithelia of the asthmatics (17Hallstrand T.S. Lai Y. Ni Z. Oslund R.C. Henderson Jr., W.R. Gelb M.H. Wenzel S.E. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We previously found that GX-sPLA2 was differentially overexpressed in the airway cells (airway epithelial cells and bronchial macrophages) of subjects with asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction compared with other human sPLA2s, with further increase in the airways of GX-sPLA2 in these subjects after exercise challenge (9Hallstrand T.S. Chi E.Y. Singer A.G. Gelb M.H. Henderson Jr., W.R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2007; 176: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Genome-wide expression profiling of this group of asthmatics with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction compared with asthmatic individuals without exercise-induced bronchoconstriction demonstrated that TGM2 (transglutaminase 2) was the gene most differentially expressed at base line between these two groups of asthmatics, with increased expression of TGM2 found in airway epithelial brushing from the asthmatics with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction compared with non-asthmatic control subjects (18Hallstrand T.S. Wurfel M.M. Lai Y. Ni Z. Gelb M.H. Altemeier W.A. Beyer R.P. Aitken M.L. Henderson Jr., W.R. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e8583Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that recombinant human TGM2 significantly augments the enzyme activity of GX-sPLA2 (18Hallstrand T.S. Wurfel M.M. Lai Y. Ni Z. Gelb M.H. Altemeier W.A.

Oslund R.C. Bollinger J.G. Henderson Jr., W.R. Santana L.F. Altemeier W.A. Gelb M.H. Hallstrand T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41491-41500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These studies suggest an important role for GX-sPLA2 in asthma pathogenesis by augmenting eicosanoid release, in particular, the proinflammatory cysteinyl leukotrienes involved in airway inflammation, remodeling, and hyperresponsiveness in this pulmonary disorder. The functional association of GX-sPLA2 and asthma was demonstrated in our previous study of allergen-induced airway inflammation in mice genetically deficient in mGX-sPLA2 (3Henderson Jr., W.R. Chi E.Y. Bollinger J.G. Tien Y.T. Ye X. Castelli L. Rubtsov Y.P. Singer A.G. Chiang G.K. Nevalainen T. Rudensky A.Y. Gelb M.H. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 865-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The results of this previous study are made stronger by the present results showing that expression of hGX-sPLA2 under the control of the mGX-sPLA2 promoter restores airway inflammation (mucus production, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and airway hyperresponsiveness) in mice lacking mGX-sPLA2. Furthermore, we have shown that this hGX-sPLA2-augmented airway inflammation can be blocked by a specific inhibitor of this enzyme when delivered continuously into the blood over the allergen challenge period. This result shows that it is possible to reduce asthma-like symptoms in a mouse model of asthma with a specific hGX-sPLA2 inhibitor, which in turn suggests that inhibitors of this sPLA2 may offer therapeutic benefit to humans suffering from asthma. Studies are under way to better understand the cellular basis of hGX-sPLA2 involvement in eicosanoid production and airway inflammation, which seems warranted given the dramatic phenotypes seen in mGX-sPLA2-deficient mice and the pharmacological results obtained in this study.

https://openalex.org/W2080583464,"As an essential structural protein required for tight compaction of the central nervous system myelin sheath, myelin basic protein (MBP) is one of the candidate autoantigens of the human inflammatory demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis, which is characterized by the active degradation of the myelin sheath. In this work, recombinant murine analogues of the natural C1 and C8 charge components (rmC1 and rmC8), two isoforms of the classic 18.5-kDa MBP, were used as model proteins to get insights into the structure and function of the charge isomers. Various biochemical and biophysical methods such as size exclusion chromatography, calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, small angle X-ray and neutron scattering, Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy, and conventional as well as synchrotron radiation circular dichroism were used to investigate differences between these two isoforms, both from the structural point of view, and regarding interactions with ligands, including calmodulin (CaM), various detergents, nucleotide analogues, and lipids. Overall, our results provide further proof that rmC8 is deficient both in structure and especially in function, when compared to rmC1. While the CaM binding properties of the two forms are very similar, their interactions with membrane mimics are different. CaM can be used to remove MBP from immobilized lipid monolayers made of synthetic lipids--a phenomenon, which may be of relevance for MBP function and its regulation. Furthermore, using fluorescently labelled nucleotides, we observed binding of ATP and GTP, but not AMP, by MBP; the binding of nucleoside triphosphates was inhibited by the presence of CaM. Together, our results provide important further data on the interactions between MBP and its ligands, and on the differences in the structure and function between MBP charge isomers."
https://openalex.org/W2097179090,"Hermaphroditism, associated with territoriality and dominance behavior, is common in the marine environment. While male sex-specific coloration patterns have been documented in groupers, particularly during the spawning season, few data regarding social structure and the context for these color displays are available. In the present study, we define the social structure and male typical behavior of rock hind (Epinephelus adscensionis) in the wild. In addition, we detail the captive conditions and time period necessary to induce the onset of the sex-specific coloration and sexual change. At six oil production platform locations in the Gulf of Mexico, rock hind social group size and typical male rock hind social behavior were documented. We observed a rapid temporary color display in rock hind that could be turned on and off within three seconds and was used for confronting territory intruders and displays of aggression towards females. The male-specific “tuxedo” pattern consists of a bright yellow tail, a body with alternating dark brown and white patches and a dark bar extending from the upper mandible to the operculum. Identification and size ranges of male, female and intersex fish collected from oil platforms were determined in conjunction with gonadal histology. Rock hind social order is haremic with one dominant male defending a territory and a linear dominance hierarchy among individuals. In five captive experiments, the largest remaining female rock hind displayed the male specific color pattern within 32d after dominant male removal from the social group. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence in a grouper species of color patterning used to display territoriality and dominance outside of spawning aggregations. The behavioral paradigm described here is a key advance that will enable mechanistic studies of this complex sex change process."
https://openalex.org/W1975252193,"Renal-specific oxidoreductase/myo-inositol oxygenase (RSOR/MIOX) catabolizes myo-inositol and is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. How high glucose (HG) ambience up-regulates its expression and enzyme activity was investigated. MIOX up-regulation was associated with an increase in enzyme activity, which was reduced to basal levels with phosphatase treatment. Using phosphothreonine, protein kinase A (PKA), and PKC substrate antibodies, analyses of kidney lysates of diabetic animals and LLC-PK1/HK-2 cells subjected to HG ambience indicated MIOX to be a phosphoprotein. Kinase phosphorylated recombinant RSOR/MIOX proteins had increased activity confined to exons 2-5. Mutants with substituted phosphorylation sites had a minimal increase in activity. Treatment of cells with PKC, PKA, and PDK1 kinase activators increased activity, whereas inhibitors reduced it. Inhibitors also reduced the phosphorylation and activity of MIOX induced by HG. Besides HG, exposure of cells to oxidants H(2)O(2) and methylglyoxal up-regulated MIOX expression and its phosphorylation and activity, whereas antioxidants N-acetylcysteine, β-naphthoflavone, and tertiary butyl hydroquinone reduced MIOX expression. Treatment with HG or oxidants or overexpression of MIOX induced nuclear translocation of redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2, which binds to antioxidant response elements of various promoters. Promoter analyses revealed an increase in luciferase activity with HG and oxidants. Analyses of antioxidant response elements and carbohydrate response elements revealed an accentuation of DNA-protein interactions with oxidants and under HG ambience. ChIP-PCR and immunofluorescence studies revealed nuclear translocation of carbohydrate response element-binding protein. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of RSOR/MIOX enhances its activity, which is augmented by HG via transcriptional/translational events that are also modulated by diabetes-related pathobiological stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2102114525,"Cellular receptors for collagens belong to the family of β(1) integrins. In the epidermis, integrin α(2)β(1) is the only collagen-binding integrin present. Its expression is restricted to basal keratinocytes with uniform distribution on the cell surface of those cells. Although α(2)β(1) receptors localized at the basal surface interact with basement membrane proteins collagen IV and laminin 111 and 332, no interaction partners have been reported for these integrin molecules at the lateral and apical membranes of basal keratinocytes. Solid phase binding and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy demonstrate that collagen XXIII, a member of the transmembrane collagens, directly interacts with integrin α(2)β(1) in an ion- and conformation-dependent manner. The two proteins co-localize on the surface of basal keratinocytes. Furthermore, collagen XXIII is sufficient to induce adhesion and spreading of keratinocytes, a process that is significantly reduced in the absence of functional integrin α(2)β(1)."
https://openalex.org/W2064171080,"Rapid mineralization of cultured osteoblasts could be a useful characteristic in stem cell-mediated therapies for fracture and other orthopedic problems. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a small amphipathic solvent molecule capable of stimulating cell differentiation. We report that, in primary human osteoblasts, DMSO dose-dependently enhanced the expression of osteoblast differentiation markers alkaline phosphatase activity and extracellular matrix mineralization. Furthermore, similar DMSO-mediated mineralization enhancement was observed in primary osteoblast-like cells differentiated from mouse mesenchymal cells derived from fat, a promising source of starter cells for cell-based therapy. Using a convenient mouse pre-osteoblast model cell line MC3T3-E1, we further investigated this phenomenon showing that numerous osteoblast-expressed genes were elevated in response to DMSO treatment and correlated with enhanced mineralization. Myocyte enhancer factor 2c (Mef2c) was identified as the transcription factor most induced by DMSO, among the numerous DMSO-induced genes, suggesting a role for Mef2c in osteoblast gene regulation. Immunohistochemistry confirmed expression of Mef2c in osteoblast-like cells in mouse mandible, cortical, and trabecular bone. shRNAi-mediated Mef2c gene silencing resulted in defective osteoblast differentiation, decreased alkaline phosphatase activity, and matrix mineralization and knockdown of osteoblast specific gene expression, including osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein. A flow on knockdown of bone-specific transcription factors, Runx2 and osterix by shRNAi knockdown of Mef2c, suggests that Mef2c lies upstream of these two important factors in the cascade of gene expression in osteoblasts.

Furthermore, similar DMSO-mediated mineralization enhancement was observed in primary osteoblast-like cells differentiated from mouse mesenchymal cells derived from fat, a promising source of starter cells for cell-based therapy. Using a convenient mouse pre-osteoblast model cell line MC3T3-E1, we further investigated this phenomenon showing that numerous osteoblast-expressed genes were elevated in response to DMSO treatment and correlated with enhanced mineralization. Myocyte enhancer factor 2c (Mef2c) was identified as the transcription factor most induced by DMSO, among the numerous DMSO-induced genes, suggesting a role for Mef2c in osteoblast gene regulation. Immunohistochemistry confirmed expression of Mef2c in osteoblast-like cells in mouse mandible, cortical, and trabecular bone. shRNAi-mediated Mef2c gene silencing resulted in defective osteoblast differentiation, decreased alkaline phosphatase activity, and matrix mineralization and knockdown of osteoblast specific gene expression, including osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein. A flow on knockdown of bone-specific transcription factors, Runx2 and osterix by shRNAi knockdown of Mef2c, suggests that Mef2c lies upstream of these two important factors in the cascade of gene expression in osteoblasts. Skeletal patterning and subsequent cellular differentiation during development is a complex process involving the activation and suppression of gene regulatory programs leading to bone formation (1Karsenty G. Nature. 2003; 423: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Once fully developed, bone remains a dynamic tissue by undergoing continual remodeling, which functions to repair microarchitectural defects and maintain skeletal integrity (2Hadjidakis D.J. Androulakis I.I. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1092: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Numerous cell types are involved in the formation and homeostasis of the skeleton. Among these are osteoblasts (bone-forming cells), which differentiate from committed mesenchymal osteoprogenitor cells (1Karsenty G. Nature. 2003; 423: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The differentiation of osteoblasts is a highly coordinated process involving a clearly defined temporal sequence of events characterized by the commitment, proliferation, and subsequent maturation of precursor cells into terminally differentiated osteoblasts (3Franceschi R.T. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 40-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 4Weiss A.J. Iqbal J. Zaidi N. Mechanick J.I. Curr. Osteoporos. Rep. 2010; 8: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). During this process, early differentiating cells undergo proliferation and secrete a collagen type 1-rich extracellular matrix. In the next phase, cellular proliferation decreases, and the cells express factors involved in matrix maturation such as alkaline phosphatase. In the final stage, osteoblasts initiate matrix mineralization and express factors such as integrin-binding sialoprotein and osteocalcin (3Franceschi R.T. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 40-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 4Weiss A.J. Iqbal J. Zaidi N. Mechanick J.I. Curr. Osteoporos.

Osteoblast differentiation is tightly coordinated by the activities of transcriptional regulators; these include the master transcription factors RUNX2 and osterix (OSX), 2The abbreviations used are: OSXosterixALPalkaline phosphataseOMosteogenic mediumα-MEMminimum essential mediumVD31,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3qPCRquantitative PCRECMextracellular matrix. which govern the expression of genes involved in the developmental process (6Marie P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 473: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). RUNX2 is indispensable for skeletal development and controls osteoblast differentiation by regulating the commitment of osteoprogenitors and activating major bone matrix genes (7Komori T. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 1233-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Osterix is also necessary for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation and functions downstream of RUNX2 (6Marie P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 473: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Other transcription factors with roles in osteoblasts include MSX2, DLX5, TWIST-1, AP1, ATF4, HOXA10, and ZFP521 (6Marie P.J. Arch. Biochem.

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; (CH3)2SO) is a small amphipathic molecule that is widely used as a solvent due to its abilities to dissolve both polar and nonpolar compounds (10Santos N.C. Figueira-Coelho J. Martins-Silva J. Saldanha C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Currently, DMSO is used as a cryo-preserving agent in cell banking (11Woods E.J. Perry B.C. Hockema J.J. Larson L. Zhou D. Goebel W.S. Cryobiology. 2009; 59: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) commonly at 10% concentrations that are then injected directly into the patient. Notably, DMSO is reported to stimulate osteoblast differentiation in MC3T3-E1, a mouse pre-osteoblast cell line, through ERK activation of transcription factors Runx2 and osterix (12Cheung W.M. Ng W.W. Kung A.W. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that DMSO acts as a potent enhancer of human and mouse osteoblast differentiation as demonstrated by the significant gains in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization observed throughout differentiation. Significantly, the effects of DMSO were anabolic in nature, such that the extent of matrix mineralization in DMSO-treated cells was greater than that of nontreated control cells, even when experiments were continued to the point where all cells were terminally differentiated. DMSO-enhanced osteoblast differentiation was used, in the model cell line MC3T3-E1, to identify novel genes involved in the developmental process. Unexpectedly, Mef2c was the transcription factor most potently induced by DMSO. Mef2c is a MADS-box transcription factor that is most commonly associated with the development and differentiation of the heart and skeletal muscle (13Potthoff M.J. Olson E.N. Development. 2007; 134: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Mef2c gene expression is dynamically regulated during osteoblast differentiation and that shRNA-mediated Mef2c gene silencing is associated with highly significant decreases in ALP activity, osteoblast gene expression, and matrix mineralization, demonstrating a critical role for Mef2c in osteoblast differentiation. MC3T3-E1 cells (subclone 14) were maintained in minimum essential medium (α-MEM) (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Invitrogen), and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen); this medium augmented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate was termed osteogenic medium (OM). For osteoblast differentiation, cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well in a total volume of 0.5 ml of medium, and then at 48 h, medium was replaced with OM with various concentrations of DMSO. Medium was changed every 72 h unless stated otherwise. For calvarial osteoblast differentiation, calvaria obtained from newborn mice were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and digested four times sequentially with 0.1% collagenase A and 0.2% dispase II (Roche Applied Science) in PBS to liberate embedded cells. The pooled digestion solution was passed through a 70-μm cell strainer, and cells were recovered via centrifugation. The cells were seeded into culture flasks containing α-MEM and grown for 3–4 days prior to osteoblast differentiation. Calvarial cells were prepared for osteoblast differentiation as per MC3T3-E1 cells. Human primary osteoblasts were obtained from biopsy material donated at orthopedic procedures; bone was minced and washed in PBS, removing marrow and adipocytes, and then treated with trypsin (Invitrogen) for 5 min. Pieces were then washed in PBS and osteoblasts permitted to grow out from explants in α-MEM with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). Mineralization and ALP assays were done as for MC3T3-E1 cells. Adipocyte-derived mesenchymal cells were obtained from 2-h collagenase digestion at 37 °C of excised and minced fat pads. Cells were washed in PBS and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 5% FBS. 293T cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Invitrogen). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. DMSO concentrations were presented as percent volume. Procedures involving human samples were approved by the institutional committee at Queensland University of Technology. Procedures involving mice were approved by the animal ethics committee of Griffith University. ALP activity was assessed via the spectrophotometric quantitation of p-nitrophenol generated through the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Briefly, cells were washed with 1 volume of PBS and lysed with the addition of 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5% Triton X-100 (per well, 24-well plate). 10 μl of cell lysate was incubated with 200 μl of 1 m diethanolamine, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.8, containing 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate for 15–30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 3 m NaOH, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Enzyme activity was standardized using purified calf intestinal ALP (New England Biolabs) and normalized to protein content as measured by the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). ALP activity was expressed as nanomoles of p-nitrophenyl phosphate converted per min per mg of protein (nanomoles/min/mg protein). Matrix mineralization was assessed using Alizarin Red S staining according to Gregory et al. (14Gregory C.A. Gunn W.G. Peister A. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). Units are absorbance of solubilized Alizarin Red S measured at 405 nm per culture well. One A405 unit represents 2.96 μmol of Alizarin Red S precipitated per culture. RNA was extracted from cells using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). For cDNA synthesis, ∼1 μg of total RNA was treated with DNase I (Sigma) to remove any residual DNA and converted to cDNA using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were carried out in 20-μl volumes, and all cDNA samples were diluted 1:5 in DNase-free water prior to real time PCR. PCR primers used in the study are listed in Table 1 and were designed from DNA sequences available through the Entrez Nucleotide database. Mouse gene nomenclature conventions were used (protein indicated by roman type and gene names in italic type). The specificities of candidate primer pairs were assessed by BLAST and BLAT analyses. Primer pairs were selected that gave single amplification products using in silico PCR. Specificity of amplification was verified by acrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealing a single fragment of the predicted size. qPCR amplifications were performed in an iCycler iQ real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) using the iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad). Reactions were carried out in total volumes of 20 μl and included 250 nm of each primer and 2 μl of diluted cDNA template containing 100 ng of cDNA. The thermal cycler conditions were as follows: step 1, 95 °C for 90 s; step 2, 95 °C for 10 s, 59 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 25 s (45 cycles); step 3, melt curve analysis from 59 to 95 °C in 0.5 °C increments. The specificity of the individual amplifications was assessed by the examination of the melt curves to confirm the presence of single gene-specific peaks of the characteristic melting temperature. Gene expression levels were normalized to the normalization factor generated by the average of Actb, B2m, Hmbs, and Hprt1 internal control genes as determined by the GeNorm algorithm of Vandesomple et al. (16Vandesompele J. De Preter K. Pattyn F. Poppe B. Van Roy N. De Paepe A. Speleman F. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0034)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Affymetrix and Illumina GeneChip microarray analysis was conducted at the Australian Genome Research Facility, Melbourne, Australia. For each sample, total RNA (10 μg) underwent quality assessment by running a sample through an Agilent BioAnalyzer prior to microarray processing and scanning. C57BL/6J mice were either day 15 fetal or week 12 adult. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, decalcified in 0.5 m EDTA for 2 weeks, and embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry. Slides were blocked with 1% FBS for 10 min, then incubated for 2 h at 21 °C with rabbit anti-MEF2C primary antibody (Abcam, 64644) diluted 1:100 in buffered saline at a final concentration of 9 μg/ml or with a nonimmune rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using the same final concentration, followed by rinses and addition of a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (DAKO) for 30 min at room temperature, slides were stained by exposure to β-diaminobenzidine-liquid chromogen (DAKO) followed by counterstaining with Mayer's hematoxylin and mounted in Cytoseal 60 (Richard Allan Scientific). Positive antibody staining was identified by the presence of brown color. Mef2c shRNA sequence 1 (Sh1) was described previously (17Zang M.X. Li Y. Wang H. Wang J.B. Jia H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54258-54263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Sh2 and Sh3 were designed using the Promega siRNA Target Designer (version 1.51) in the mouse Mef2c mRNA. Sequence specificities were assessed via BLAST analysis. Forward and reverse oligonucleotides encoding the shRNA sequences (Table 1) were annealed via thermal cycling and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pSIREN-RetroQ (Clontech). The pSIREN-RetroQ Luc vector (Clontech), which targets firefly luciferase, was used as a control. Retroviral particle production was performed by co-transfection of pSIREN-RetroQ vectors, the VSV-G envelope glycoprotein vector pCSIG, and the Friend murine leukemia virus-based Gag-Pol expression vector pC57GP (18Lassaux A. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in 293T cells using FuGENE HD transfection reagent. Fresh medium was added to cells 24 h post-transfection, and viral supernatants were harvested 48 h later. Viral supernatants were passed through a 0.45-μm pore size filter and used directly for infections. Infections were performed by seeding MC3T3-E1 cells at 2.5 × 105 cells in 25-cm2 culture vessels. 24 h later, the medium was replaced with viral supernatant containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene. 24 h later, infected cells were selected by replacing the viral supernatant with fresh medium containing 4 μg/ml puromycin. Infected cells were expanded in culture prior to use for subsequent analyses. Transient transfections were done using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mef2c expression vector was constructed in pBABE vector (Addgene) using mouse Mef2c coding region amplified from MC3T3-E1 cDNA. pOSLUC was made by inserting the 600 bp of human osteocalcin promoter upstream of firefly luciferase in the pGLBasic vector (Promega). This construct contains Runx2, osterix, and vitamin D receptor-binding sites. Renilla luciferase was used as a control for transfection efficiency according to the Dual-Glo procedure (Promega). Phosphorylation status of kinases was assayed using RayBio Phospho-ELISA kits exactly according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cellular proliferation was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells per well in 24-well culture plates and grown in osteogenic medium for 1–7 days. Cultures were gently washed once with warm PBS, and fresh medium containing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml was added to the wells. After an incubation period of 3 h, medium was removed, and the dye was solubilized via the addition of 200 μl of isopropyl alcohol containing 0.1% SDS and 0.04 n hydrochloric acid. The absorbance of the dye solution was measured at 570 nm. ALP activity, ECM mineralization, and cellular proliferation assays were assessed using Student's t test or analysis of variance with LSD post hoc tests. Analysis of variance of natural log-transformed gene expression data with LSD post hoc tests was used to assess the significance of differences between means. For time course analysis, the generalized linear model (SPSS) was used. Cycle threshold corrected for housekeeper genes was considered a normally distributed trait and used for statistical analysis. Significant differences were denoted by p < 0.01. Error bars in graphs represent a standard error. In some cases where effects are obvious and substantial, p values are not presented. Primary human osteoblasts were cultured in OM supplemented with increasing concentrations of DMSO, resulting in increased ALP activity (Fig. 1A) and enhanced mineral formation as detected using Alizarin Red staining (Fig. 1B). Similarly, mouse mesenchymal cells, derived from testicular fat pads cultured in OM, exhibited a similar dose response of increased ALP activity and enhanced mineralization to DMSO supplementation (Fig. 1, C and D, respectively). The response of the pre-osteoblast model cell line, MC3T3-E1, to DMSO was characterized in detail for the dose response of ALP activity and mineralization (at 12 days, Fig. 2, A and B, respectively) and time course of response at 0.55% DMSO (Fig. 2, C and D, respectively). Enzyme activity levels were maximally induced (2.9-fold) at 0.55% DMSO and gradually decreased at the two higher doses of 0.8 and 1.0%, while still significantly elevated compared with control. In parallel, a highly significant dose-dependent increase in ECM mineralization was also observed in response to DMSO treatment (Fig. 2B). The rise in mineralization paralleled ALP activity. As expected, mineralization was not detected over the first 5 days of differentiation for either treatment group. By 7 days, small amounts of mineralization were detectable in both groups with levels slightly greater in DMSO-treated cells. Beyond that time, DMSO-treated cells contained significantly more mineral than control cells at every time point and culminated in a 2.4-fold increase by day 21. These data indicated that DMSO exerted an anabolic effect on MC3T3-E1 osteoblast differentiation where cells contained significantly increased levels of ALP enzyme activity and deposited greater amounts of mineral in response to treatment. Exposure of cells in OM to DMSO for the first 3 days of culture was sufficient for the maximal enhanced mineralization effect, as delayed addition did not result in increased mineralization (Fig. 2E). These data suggest a critical early time window of effect of DMSO on MC3T3-E1 cells. In the first 2 days DMSO did not have a significant effect on cellular proliferation; however, a minor suppression became apparent at 3 days that persisted as cells differentiated under the effect of DMSO and OM (Fig. 2F). A critical early window of exposure to DMSO was observed, although the full mineralization effect in MC3T3-E1 cells developed over several days after this critical window. If DMSO had a direct inducing effect on bone-specific promoters, increased gene induction might be expected within that 72-h window. This was tested by transfecting a human osteocalcin promoter-luciferase construct into MC3T3-E1 cells and culturing in OM for 48 h. DMSO (2.5%) exposure was limited to the last 24 h prior to harvest (at 72 h after transfection) and assay to minimize effects on proliferation and focus on transcription effects. Two known inducers of human osteocalcin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3, 100 nm) treatment and Runx2 expression vector co-transfection, were used as positive controls. VD3 activation depends on endogenous vitamin D receptor. As expected, VD3 induced the human osteocalcin promoter. In the absence of DMSO, maximal expression was seen with VD3 and Runx2 treatment (6.8-fold). In the presence of DMSO, a significant boost to induction was seen, up to 18.5-fold (p < 10−9, see Fig. 2G). An increase in osteocalcin induction in MC3T3-E1 cells after 24 h of exposure to DMSO treatment (in OM) is consistent with additional transcription factors being available to enhance promoter activity. Quantitative assays for the phosphorylation status of protein kinases across the first 30 h in OM plus DMSO compared with OM found no convincing involvement of DMSO in ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK signaling pathways. Significant increases in phosphorylated signaling factors were seen after 30 h, with 2.8-fold (p = 4.8 × 10−7), for phospho-JNK, 1.8-fold (p = 7.8 × 10−5) for phospho-ERK, and only 1.4-fold (p = 8.6 × 10−6) for phospho-p38 MAPK. Significant effects of DMSO on phosphorylated kinases were observed for ERK (p = 0.009) and JNK (p = 0.014); however, these were only minor decreases in DMSO-treated cells (10 and 7% decreases for ERK and JNK, respectively). There were no significant effects on total kinase content between OM and OM plus DMSO treatments at any time point for ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, or JNK (data not shown), although total kinase increased over time. Finally, we considered if the pool of phosphorylated kinase over total kinase changed according to DMSO; once again there were no significant DMSO-related changes within 30 h. Furthermore, experiments with inhibitors of these pathways at appropriate concentrations did not suggest a role for the following inhibitors and pathways in the DMSO effect: U0126 for the ERK1/2 pathway, SB203580 for the p38 MAPK pathway, and Ly-294002 for the PI3K/AKT pathway. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 is reported to inhibit osteoblast gene activation through phosphorylation of osterix (19Ortuño M.J. Ruiz-Gaspà S. Rodríguez-Carballo E. Susperregui A.R. Bartrons R. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 31985-31994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, SB203580 decreased ALP activity in a dose-dependent manner in MC3T3-E1 cells grown in OM; however, the DMSO enhancement was still proportional to the reduced ALP activity (Fig. 2H). Taken together, these data suggest that the initial effects of DMSO action in osteoblasts occur in a critical 72-h window and may involve enhanced induction of osteocalcin at the transcriptional level (based on promoter transfection), but it seems unlikely to involve p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK, or PI3K/Akt at least within the first 30 h. Those effects observed were either in the reverse sense to a DMSO-mediated enhancement effect or were minor enough in magnitude as to be discounted. DMSO was clearly able to enhance osteoblast differentiation as revealed by elevated ALP activity and mineralization. We next set out to investigate the effects of DMSO on osteoblast gene expression. Accordingly, the expression of marker genes was assessed at multiple time points throughout osteoblast differentiation. Cells were grown in osteogenic conditions over a period of 19 days and were harvested for qPCR analysis of endogenous gene expression at numerous time points (Fig. 3). Gene expression was expressed as fold change in transcript levels, measured by qPCR, referenced to zero time. Transcript levels for endogenous mouse osteocalcin (mouse gene Bglap2) were approximately doubled by DMSO treatment, reaching a peak at day 7 (Fig. 3A). Similar changes were seen in integrin-binding sialoprotein (Ibsp, Fig. 3B), matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Fig. 3C), and the osteoclast differentiation factor, receptor activator of NFκB ligand (Rankl, Fig. 3D). Not all extracellular matrix protein genes were induced by DMSO; dermatopontin (Dpt) was potently repressed by DMSO (Fig. 3E). The expression of osteoblast transcription factor, osterix (Osx, Fig. 3F), was significantly increased by DMSO treatment at 3 days and sh"
https://openalex.org/W2071739144,"The discovery of the role of P2Y12 receptor in platelet aggregation leads to a new anti-thrombotic drug Plavix; however, little is known about non-platelet P2Y receptors in thrombosis. This study tested the hypothesis that endothelial P2Y receptor(s) mediates up-regulation of tissue factor (TF), the initiator of coagulation cascade. Stimulation of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) by UTP/ATP increased the mRNA level of TF but not of its counterpart-tissue factor pathway inhibitor, which was accompanied by up-regulation of TF protein and cell surface activity. RT-PCR revealed a selective expression of P2Y2 and P2Y11 receptors in HCAEC. Consistent with this, TF up-regulation was inhibited by suramin or by siRNA silencing of P2Y2 receptor, but not by NF-157, a P2Y11-selective antagonist, suggesting a role for the P2Y2 receptor. In addition, P2Y2 receptor activated ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways without affecting the positive NF-κB and negative AKT regulatory pathways of TF expression. Furthermore, TF up-regulation was abolished or partially suppressed by inhibition of p38 or JNK but not ERK1/2. Interestingly, blockade of the PLC/Ca2+ pathway did not affect P2Y2 receptor activation of p38, JNK, and TF induction. However, blockade of Src kinase reduced phosphorylation of p38 but not JNK, eliminating TF induction. In contrast, inhibition of Rho kinase reduced phosphorylation of JNK but not p38, decreasing TF expression. These findings demonstrate that P2Y2 receptor mediates TF expression in HCAEC through new mechanisms involving Src/p38 and Rho/JNK pathways, possibly contributing to a pro-thrombotic status after vascular injury. The discovery of the role of P2Y12 receptor in platelet aggregation leads to a new anti-thrombotic drug Plavix; however, little is known about non-platelet P2Y receptors in thrombosis. This study tested the hypothesis that endothelial P2Y receptor(s) mediates up-regulation of tissue factor (TF), the initiator of coagulation cascade. Stimulation of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) by UTP/ATP increased the mRNA level of TF but not of its counterpart-tissue factor pathway inhibitor, which was accompanied by up-regulation of TF protein and cell surface activity. RT-PCR revealed a selective expression of P2Y2 and P2Y11 receptors in HCAEC. Consistent with this, TF up-regulation was inhibited by suramin or by siRNA silencing of P2Y2 receptor, but not by NF-157, a P2Y11-selective antagonist, suggesting a role for the P2Y2 receptor. In addition, P2Y2 receptor activated ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways without affecting the positive NF-κB and negative AKT regulatory pathways of TF expression. Furthermore, TF up-regulation was abolished or partially suppressed by inhibition of p38 or JNK but not ERK1/2. Interestingly, blockade of the PLC/Ca2+ pathway did not affect P2Y2 receptor activation of p38, JNK, and TF induction. However, blockade of Src kinase reduced phosphorylation of p38 but not JNK, eliminating TF induction. In contrast, inhibition of Rho kinase reduced phosphorylation of JNK but not p38, decreasing TF expression. These findings demonstrate that P2Y2 receptor mediates TF expression in HCAEC through new mechanisms involving Src/p38 and Rho/JNK pathways, possibly contributing to a pro-thrombotic status after vascular injury. Nucleotides are well known for being the universal currency of intracellular energy transaction, but over the past few decades it has been established that nucleotides also serve as extracellular signaling molecules (1Burnstock G.

Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1127-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), playing important roles in cardiovascular regulation (3Burnstock G. Kennedy C. Circ.

Long term trophic and inflammatory signaling upon nucleotide activation of P2Y receptors are implicated in vascular cell proliferation, migration, and platelet aggregation, leading to vascular remodeling, restenosis, atherosclerosis, and thrombosis. Therefore, at least some subtypes of the P2Y receptor family (P2Y1, 2, 4, 6, 11–14) are potential therapeutic targets for cardiovascular diseases. Indeed, the discovery of the role of P2Y12 receptor in platelet biology (7Kunapuli S.P. Dorsam R.T. Kim S. Quinton T.M. Curr. Opin Pharmacol. 2003; 3: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 8Gachet C. Hechler B. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2005; 31: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) led to the design of clopidogrel (Plavix), which has become one of the most used drugs in treatment of atherothrombosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The mechanism for the anti-thrombotic effect of Plavix is the blockade of P2Y12 receptor on platelets, preventing platelets from being activated by ADP, thus limiting platelet aggregation and clot formation. Despite extensive study of the P2Y12 receptor in platelets, very little is known about the contribution of non-platelet P2Y receptors in thrombosis. Platelet activation and aggregation is the final stage of thrombosis, which is developed from a hypercoagulable status due to tissue factor (TF) 2The abbreviations used are: TFtissue factorTFPITF pathway inhibitorVCAMvascular cell adhesion moleculePLCphospholipase CHCAEChuman coronary artery endothelial cells. exposure to blood. An abundance of active TF in atherosclerotic lesions plays a key role in atherothrombosis by triggering a hypercoagulable status (9Steffel J. Lüscher T.F. Tanner F.C. Circulation. 2006; 113: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 10Mackman N. Nature. 2008; 451: 914-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). In normal conditions, TF is constitutively expressed at the subendothelial level by smooth muscle cells in the tunica media and by fibroblasts in the adventitia surrounding the vessels (11Wilcox J.N. Smith K.M. Schwartz S.M. Gordon D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 2839-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), whereas it is virtually undetectable in endothelium. Hence, the endothelial layer prevents TF from direct exposure to circulating blood. However, TF expression in endothelial cells can be induced in pathological conditions such as during inflammatory responses. The exposure of cell surface TF to plasma proteins leads to the binding of factor VIIa to TF, causing ultimate activation of the coagulation cascade, thrombin generation, and thrombi formation. Therefore, identification of novel factors in control of inducible TF expression in endothelial and blood cells will provide new insights into preventing the occurrence of pathological thrombosis in the early initiating stage. tissue factor TF pathway inhibitor vascular cell adhesion molecule phospholipase C human coronary artery endothelial cells. Several endogenous factors, such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor a (TNFα), thrombin, and VEGF, induce endothelial TF expression (12Breitenstein A. Tanner F.C. Lüscher T.F. Circ. J. 2010; 74: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because many, if not all, pathological conditions that cause TF expression are associated with nucleotide release, we propose that P2Y receptors may also be involved in regulating inducible TF expression. Although the intracellular regulatory signaling mechanisms responsible for TF induction are not completely elucidated, there is evidence showing that most of these known mediators share similar signal transduction pathways such as MAPKs pathways. Activation of P2Y receptors is commonly associated with the stimulation of these pathways, further raising the likelihood of P2Y receptor involvement in TF induction. Therefore, we hypothesize that activation of P2Y receptor(s) prompts endothelial TF expression, leading to a pro-thrombotic endothelial phenotype. The principle objective of this study was to determine whether activation of P2Y receptors can induce TF expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and, if so, which P2Y receptor(s) is responsible for this function. Second, we sought to determine the intracellular signaling pathways that are involved in TF induction. Our findings demonstrate that in HCAEC, both ATP and UTP induce TF expression, and the P2Y2 receptor is responsible for UTP-induced TF expression. Furthermore, the Src/p38 pathway is required for, and the Rho/JNK pathway contributes to, nucleotide-induced TF expression. HCAEC were cultured in EBM-2 supplemented with VEGF, FGF, EGF, IGF, ascorbic acid, GA 1000 (Lonza), and 10% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HCAEC were used between the third and eighth passages, seeded at 105 cells/well in a six-well plate and grown for 24 h, reaching ∼80–90% confluence. Then the cells were starved overnight and pretreated with inhibitors or antagonists for 1 h before stimulation with different agonists at the indicated times and concentrations. Total RNA and DNA were extracted from HCAEC using the RNeasy and DNeasy kits, respectively (Qiagen). For the synthesis of the first strand of cDNA, 1 μg of total RNA after DNase (Ambion) treatment was reverse-transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems). The cDNA samples were then amplified by PCR using 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The sequences of primers for P2Y receptors are listed in online supplemental Table 1. The PCR condition was for 40 cycles of the following: jump start for 2 min at 95 °C, denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min at 56 °C, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The resulting PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose ethidium bromide gel, and the bands were visualized with ultraviolet light. Real time RT-PCR was performed on an iCycler iQ5 detection system (Bio-Rad) with SYBR Green reagents (Applied Biosystems). The PCR mixture (25 μl) contained 0.6 μm concentrations of each primer, 8 μl of water, 12.5 μl of SYBR Green mixture, and 2.0 μl of cDNA. The samples were placed and sealed in 96-well plates with the following reaction condition: reverse transcription step (30 min at 50 °C), initial PCR activation step (15 min at 90 °C), and cycling steps (denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 58 °C, extension for 1 min at 72 °C, 40 cycles). An internal control, GAPDH, was amplified in separate tubes. We used the comparative cycle threshold ΔΔCt method for relative quantification of gene expression. HCAEC were cultured on 8-chamber glass slides (Nunc). After 1 day in culture, cells were starved and treated with UTP, ATP, or TNFα for 4 h, after which cells were fixed for 10 min in cold methanol. The fixed cells were washed with PBS and blocked with 3% horse serum for 1 h at room temperature. Then the cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-human TF antibody (1:100) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 60 min at room temperature. For negative controls, cells were incubated with non-immune IgG in place of the specific primary antibody. Cell surface TF was detected by a cell-based ELISA kit (Columbia Bio LLC) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, HCAEC were seeded into 96-well plates and stimulated by UTP for 4 h. Then, the cells were fixed by 50 μl of fixatives (without permeabilization) for 20 min and blocked for 20 min after incubation with the mouse anti-human TF antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes, 50 μl of tetramethyl benzidine substrate linked with a second antibody was added and maintained until color developed. The optical density absorbance was read on a Microplate Reader ELX800 (Bio-TEK Instruments Inc.) at 450 nm. Relative cell surface TF protein was presented as change of optical density values in UTP-stimulated cells over control cells. TF pro-coagulant activity in HCAEC surface was analyzed by a two-stage chromogenic assay (ACTICHROME®, American Diagnostica Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, HCAEC were grown in 6-well plates and stimulated with UTP, ATP, or TNFα for 4 h. After 2 washes, cells were incubated with assay buffer (300 μl), 25 μl of factor FVIIa, and 25 μl of factor X at 37 °C for 15 min. Then 25 μl of Spectrozyme factor Xa substrate was added and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Finally, 200 μl of the reaction mixture in each well were transferred into 96-well plates and read on a microplate reader as described above at 405 nm. A TF standard curve was constructed by following the kit instructions. After stimulation, cells were lysed, and standard Western blotting was performed as previously described (13Shen J. Halenda S.P. Sturek M. Wilden P.A. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 982-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The individual primary antibodies used were anti-TF (1:3000), anti-p-ERK, anti-p38, anti-p-JNK, anti-IκBa, anti-p-p65, anti-p-Src, and anti-p-FAK (1:1000). Equal protein loading was verified by stripping off the original antibodies and re-probing the membranes with the primary antibody β-actin, GAPDH, histone H3, total ERK1/2, p38, or JNK (1:1000). Measurement of intracellular [Ca2+]i concentration was performed using the FluoForteTM Calcium Assay kit (Enzo Life Sciences). Briefly, HCAEC were plated in growth medium in 96-well plates at 6 × 104 cells/100 μl/well. After 24 h, cells were pretreated with U73122 for 1 h, then the growth medium was removed, and 100 μl of Dye-loading solution was added in the presence of U73122. The cells were further incubated for 45 min at 37 °C and 15 min at room temperature before stimulation, after which the cells were challenged with UTP, and a time-response curve of intracellular [Ca2+]i signal was recorded via real-time monitoring of fluorescence intensity at excitation = 490 nm and emission = 525 nm in a Fluorometric Microplate Reader (FLUOstar Omega). To knock down the P2Y2 receptor, HCAEC were transfected with the four sequence pool (ON-TARGET plus SMART pool L-003688-00-0005, human P2RY2, NM_002564, Dharmacon) using DharmaFECT 4 Transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, HCAEC were seeded in 6-well plates at 80–90% confluence; the medium was replaced with complete EBM-2 without antibiotics before transfection. DharmaFECT 4 and siRNA products were incubated separately in EBM-2 at room temperature for 5 min. Mixtures were combined, incubated another 20 min, and added to cells at a final concentration of 2 μl/ml DharmaFECT 4 and 25 nm siRNAs. Real-time PCR assay was performed to confirm the decrease of P2Y2 receptor mRNA after 24 h post-transfection. For UTP stimulation, siRNA and transfection reagent were removed 24 h post-transfection, and complete culture medium was added. After overnight starvation, cells were stimulated by UTP as described above. HCAEC and endothelial cell basal medium-2 were purchased from Lonza. P2Y2-transfected 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. Gary A. Weisman (University of Missouri-Columbia). Purified UTP and ATP were obtained from Sigma. Actinomycin D, cycloheximide, U0126, SB203580, SP600125, VX745, TCS-JNK6o, LY294002, L-NIO, U73122, Y-27632, suramin, and NF-157 were purchased from Tocris Bioscience. BAY11-7082, SKI-1, and PP2 were from EMD. Anti-tissue factor mouse mAb (TF9–10H10) was obtained from Calbiochem. Other antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The means of two groups were compared using Student's t test (unpaired, two tailed), and one-way analysis of variance was used for comparison of more than 2 groups with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were repeated at least three times. We first analyzed the expression profile of P2Y receptors in HCAEC, as it has not been determined in human coronary artery endothelium or cultured cells. Our RT-PCR analysis showed that HCAEC expressed P2Y2 and P2Y11 receptor mRNAs, with virtually no detectable mRNAs for the other six subtype receptors (Fig. 1). No significant change was observed in receptor expression pattern when the cells were starved overnight in comparison to normal cultures (Fig. 1). This result indicates that HCAEC predominantly express UTP/ATP-sensitive P2Y2 receptor and ATP/ADP-sensitive P2Y11 receptor. To determine whether activation of P2Y receptors can induce TF expression, cells were stimulated with agonists for various time intervals. TF protein expression was increased within 2 h, reached a maximum level at 4 h, and declined to the basal level at 8 h after the serum-starved HCAEC were challenged with 100 μm UTP or ATP (Fig. 2A). A dose-dependent increase of TF protein expression was observed after HCAEC were stimulated with different concentrations of UTP or ATP (Fig. 2B). Of note, the level of TF induction by UTP/ATP was even comparable with that of TNFα (Fig. 2A), a known inducer of TF expression in various cells. Because TF can be stored in some intracellular compartments in addition to cell surface localization, a cell-based ELISA was employed to detect the cell surface TF expression in response to UTP. In line with total TF expression, the cell surface TF expression was significantly up-regulated by UTP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Consistent with this, immunofluorescence study showed that TF antigen was barely detectable in quiescent untreated control HCAEC (Fig. 2D). However, in cells treated with UTP or ATP, there was diffused TF staining over the entire cell surface and intracellular space as well. A similar result was obtained when cells were stimulated with TNFα (Fig. 2D). To confirm whether enhanced cell surface TF protein translates to increased TF activity, TF pro-coagulant activity was determined by a two-step colorimetric assay based on the ability of TF to promote generation of coagulation factor Xa. Fig. 2E shows that UTP or ATP stimulation significantly increased cell surface TF activity over untreated control cells. Together, these results indicate that UTP/ATP stimulation of P2Y receptor(s) can induce TF expression and activity in HCAEC. To determine whether the effect of ATP/UTP on TF protein expression is related to TF mRNA expression, real-time PCR assay was performed. A peak elevation of TF mRNA level was detected as early as 1 h, and expression returned to the basal level after 3 h (Fig. 3A). Similar to TF protein induction, TF mRNA level was also up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner by ATP or UTP (Fig. 3B). This result indicates that activation of UTP/ATP-sensitive P2Y receptor(s) induces TF expression both at the protein and mRNA levels. To confirm whether increased expression of TF mRNA involves transcriptional mechanism(s) and needs de novo synthesis of protein(s), cells were pretreated with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D or the translation inhibitor cycloheximide for 1 h before UTP stimulation. Fig. 3C shows that actinomycin D pretreatment suppressed UTP-induced TF expression both at mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, cycloheximide pretreatment almost eliminated the induction of TF protein as expected but induced significant TF mRNA up-regulation and further enhanced UTP-induced TF mRNA expression (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that the up-regulation of TF mRNA by UTP may involve a transcriptional mechanism(s) but does not need synthesis of new proteins. This result also implies that there is a cycloheximide-regulated mechanism for TF mRNA expression. To assess the specificity of nucleotide induction of TF expression, we examined the effect of UTP on the mRNA expression of TFPI, a direct physiological inhibitor of the TF-FVIIa complex. Interestingly, stimulation of the cells with UTP did not affect TFPI expression in HCAEC (Fig. 3D), suggesting that activation of the P2Y receptor(s) in HCAEC selectively up-regulates TF but not its counterpart TFPI. To determine whether the nucleotide action is through P2Y receptor(s), suramin, a broad-spectrum antagonist of P2Y receptors was employed. Fig. 4A shows that suramin dose-dependently reduced UTP-induced TF mRNA and protein expression, suggesting an involvement of the P2Y receptor(s). To further clarify which P2Y receptor subtype(s) is responsible for TF induction, the P2Y11 receptor-selective antagonist NF-157 was used because no P2Y2 receptor-selective antagonist is currently available. Fig. 4B shows that UTP-stimulated TF induction was not affected by NF-157, suggesting that P2Y11 receptor does not contribute to UTP-induced TF expression. Furthermore, UTP was able to induce TF expression in 1321N1 cells stably transfected with P2Y2 receptor cDNA but not in the wild type 1321N1 cells that lack any endogenous P2Y receptors (Fig. 4C), further supporting the involvement of the P2Y2 receptor. To further confirm a role for P2Y2 receptor, we knocked down the P2Y2 receptor by a siRNA approach. P2Y2 receptor mRNA decreased 24 h after transfection of a pool of P2Y2 siRNAs as determined by real-time PCR (Fig. 4D). Silencing P2Y2 receptor abrogated UTP- and ATP-induced TF expression, whereas the scramble siRNA did not affect UTP- or ATP-induced TF expression (Fig. 4, E and F). In addition, ADP, agonist of P2Y11 receptor, did not up-regulate TF expression (Fig. 4F). Collectively, these data indicate that the P2Y2 receptor mediates UTP- and ATP-induced TF expression in HCAEC. It is well established that NF-κB is the major positive pathway in control of TF induction. To investigate whether this pathway is involved in P2Y2 receptor induction of TF expression, the IκBa and p-p65 levels were analyzed when the cells were treated with different concentrations of UTP. Fig. 5A shows that UTP did not induce IκBa degradation or increase of p65 phosphorylation; however, TNFα as a positive control greatly reduced total IκBa and increased p65 phosphorylation. In addition, BAY11-7082, a well known selective inhibitor of NF-κB pathway, abolished TNFα-induced, but not UTP-induced, TF expression (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that the NF-κB pathway is not involved in P2Y2 receptor-mediated TF induction in HCAEC. The PI3K/AKT pathway negatively regulates TF induction (14Blum S. Issbrüker K. Willuweit A. Hehlgans S. Lucerna M. Mechtcheriakova D. Walsh K. von der Ahe D. Hofer E. Clauss M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33428-33434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine whether this pathway has such a role, we analyzed the effect of UTP on AKT phosphorylation. A basal level of p-AKT was detected that was not affected by UTP (Fig. 5C). In addition, both the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor L-NIO did not have significant effect on UTP-induced TF expression (Fig. 5D). These data indicate that P2Y2 receptor-mediated TF up-regulation in HCAEC does not involve an AKT-related mechanism. To determine the roles of MAPK kinases, we first assessed the effect of P2Y2 receptor activation on MAPK pathways. Fig. 6 shows that UTP caused rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK in a dose-dependent manner. However, UTP-induced TF expression was not affected despite the complete inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (Fig. 6C). In contrast, SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 kinase, dose-dependently inhibited UTP-induced p38 phosphorylation and TF expression (Fig. 6D). Phosphorylation of JNK was greatly reduced by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 at 10 μm, whereas UTP-induced TF expression was not affected, which may be due to slight activation of p38 by this inhibitor at this particular dose (Fig. 6E). To support this notion, we increased SP600125 concentration to 30 μm, which further decreased JNK phosphorylation and caused a significant reduction of TF expression as well without affecting p38 activation (Fig. 6E). We further confirmed this result using structurally different chemical inhibitors targeting on either p38 (VX745, 10 μm) or JNK (TCS-JNK6o, 10 μm, Fig. 6H). Fig. 6, F and G, further shows that UTP-induced p38 activation was suppressed by suramin, but not by NF-157, which effectively blocked ADP-induced p38 activation, suggesting a role of P2Y2, not P2Y11, in UTP signaling. These data indicate that p38 and JNK, but not ERK1/2, are involved in P2Y2 receptor-mediated TF expression in HCAEC. Because P2Y2 receptor activates PLC via the Gq protein, leading to an increase of intracellular Ca2+, we postulated that PLC might be the potential upstream regulator of p38 and JNK in P2Y2 receptor signaling and TF induction. As expected, U73122, a specific inhibitor of PLC, dose-dependently suppressed intracellular Ca2+ elevation caused by UTP (Fig. 7A). However, neither the phosphorylation of p38 nor the phosphorylation of JNK was affected by U73122 (Fig. 7B). Similarly, UTP-induced TF expression was also not affected by U73122, even at its highest concentration (Fig. 7C), suggesting that PLC plays no role in P2Y2 receptor signaling to p38 or JNK or TF induction in HCAEC. To assess whether the canonical PI-PLC pathway is dispensable for other G-protein-coupled receptor-induced TF expression, HCAEC were pretreated with U73122 and then stimulated with either thrombin or histamine. Fig. 7D clearly shows that U73122 had no significant effect on thrombin- and histamine-induced TF up-regulation. To further explore a potential role of Gi/o protein, we employed pertussis toxin. Fig. 7E shows that pertussis toxin treatment (overnight, 100 ng/ml) abolished UTP-induced TF expression, with no significant impact on TNFα-induced TF up-regulation. Because P2Y2 receptor directly interacts with and activates Src kinase (15Liu J. Liao Z. Camden J. Griffin K.D. Garrad R.C. Santiago-Pérez L.I. González F.A. Seye C.I. Weisman G.A. Erb L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8212-8218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we sought to determine a potential role of Src kinase. It is recommended that a combination of Src-I and PP2, two structurally different Src kinase inhibitors, be used to evaluate a biological function of Src kinase (16Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). Fig. 8A shows that both Src-I and PP2 reduced phosphorylation of p38, but not JNK, implying Src might be the upstream regulator of p38. In addition, Src kinase was activated by UTP as evidenced by rapid phosphorylation of Src and its substrate FAK (Fig. 8B). In parallel, UTP-induced TF expression was abolished by Src-I and was greatly reduced by PP2 (Fig. 8C). Furthermore, we confirmed the effective inhibition of Src and FAK by PP2 (Fig. 8D). Taken together, these data indicate Src is the upstream regulator of p38 in mediating P2Y2 receptor induction of TF expression. Because the Rho pathway is implicated in thrombin-induced TF expression (17Eto M. Kozai T. Cosentino F. Joch H. Lüscher T.F. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1756-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and the P2Y2 receptor has been shown to activate the small GTPase RhoA (18Seye C.I. Yu N. Jain R. Kong Q. Minor T. Newton J. Erb L. González F.A. Weisman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24960-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we therefore examined whether Rho kinase might be the upstream regulator of p38 or JNK in response to P2Y2 receptor activation. Pretreatment of HCAEC with a selective Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 partially inhibited phosphorylation of JNK but not of p38 (Fig. 8E). In addition, UTP-induced TF expression was significantly reduced by Y27632 (Fig. 8F), suggesting that Rho A kinase is the upstream regulator of JNK, contributing to P2Y2 receptor induction of TF expression in HCAEC. In the present study we show for the first time that UTP or ATP stimulates TF expression both in protein and mRNA levels in HCAEC. We also show that Src/p38 and Rho/JNK pathways are involved in nucleotide induction of TF expression. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the P2Y2 receptor is responsible for UTP/ATP signaling and TF induction in HCAEC. These findings provide a new link between non-platelet P2Y receptor and the induction of TF, a master initiator of coagulation cascade, leading to thrombosis. Although extensive prior studies have focused on platelet P2Y12 receptor and thrombosis, virtually nothing is known about the roles of non-platelet P2Y receptors in the initiation and/or propagation of thrombosis. However, accumulating evidence indicates pathological roles of non-platelet P2Y receptors in other vascular diseases. This is particularly true for the P2Y2 receptor, which is up-regulated in smooth muscle cells of injured rat aorta (19Seye C.I. Gadeau A.P. Daret D. Dupuch F. Alzieu P. Capron L. Desgranges C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3602-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), rabbit carotid artery (20Seye C.I. Kong Q. Erb L. Garrad R.C. Krugh B. Wang M. Turner J.T. Sturek M.

Studies in these different animal models consistently showed that activation of the up-regulated P2Y2 receptor promotes smooth muscle cell proliferation, contributing to neointima formation. In addition, it has also been proposed that the endothelial P2Y2 receptor exerts a proinflammatory effe"
https://openalex.org/W1983867761,"Most seabirds are diurnal foragers, but some species may also feed at night. In Peruvian pelicans (Pelecanus thagus), the evidence for nocturnal foraging is sparse and anecdotal. We used GPS-dataloggers on five incubating Peruvian pelicans from Isla Lobos de Tierra, Perú, to examine their nocturnality, foraging movements and activities patterns at sea. All instrumented pelicans undertook nocturnal trips during a 5-7 day tracking period. Eighty-seven percent of these trips (n = 13) were strictly nocturnal, whereas the remaining occurred during the day and night. Most birds departed from the island after sunset and returned a few hours after sunrise. Birds traveled south of the island for single-day trips at a maximum range of 82.8 km. Overall, 22% of the tracking period was spent at sea, whereas the remaining time was spent on the island. In the intermediate section of the trip (between inbound and outbound commutes), birds spent 77% of the trip time in floating bouts interspersed by short flying bouts, the former being on average three times longer than the latter. Taken together, the high sinuosity of the bird's tracks during floating bouts, the exclusively nocturnal trips of most individuals, and the fact that all birds returned to the island within a few hours after sunrise suggest that pelicans were actively feeding at night. The nocturnal foraging strategy of Peruvian pelicans may reduce food competition with the sympatric and strictly diurnal Guanay cormorants (Phalacrocorax bougainvillii), Peruvian boobies (Sula variegata) and Blue-footed boobies (S. nebouxii), which were present on the island in large numbers. Likewise, plankton bioluminescence might be used by pelicans as indirect cues to locate anchovies during their upward migration at night. The foraging success of pelicans at night may be enhanced by seizing prey close to the sea surface using a sit-and-wait strategy."
https://openalex.org/W1978849759,"In newborn mice, PLRP2 is essential for fat digestion. In human infants, the role of PLRP2 in fat digestion is unclear, as it has poor activity against long-chain triglycerides in vitro. Also, many infants carry a genetic polymorphism resulting in a truncated protein, PLRP2 W340X, which may impact function significantly. We re-examined the properties of recombinant human PLRP2 and studied the impact of W340X mutation on its function. In the presence of bile salt micelles and colipase, human PLRP2 hydrolyzed long-chain tri-, di-, and monoglycerides. It hydrolyzed triolein at a level much lower than that of pancreatic triglyceride lipase, but close to that of carboxyl ester lipase, after a long lag phase, which could be eliminated by the addition of oleic acids. Human PLRP2 W340X was poorly secreted and largely retained inside the cell. The retention of the mutant protein triggered endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein responses. Our results show that earlier studies underestimated human PLRP2 activity against triolein by employing suboptimal assay conditions. In vivo, dietary fat emulsions contain fatty acids as a result of the action of gastric lipase. Consequently, PLRP2 can contribute to fat digestion during early infancy. Furthermore, infants with homozygous W340X alleles will not secrete functional PLRP2 and may have inefficient dietary fat digestion, particularly when breastfeeding is unavailable. Additionally, the aberrant folding of W340X mutant may cause chronic cellular stress and increase susceptibility of pancreatic exocrine cells to other metabolic stressors.

IntroductionPancreatic lipases are critical for efficient dietary fat digestion. Of the multiple pancreatic lipases, PTL 2The abbreviations used are: PTLpancreatic triglyceride lipaseCELcarboxyl ester lipaseERADER-associated degradationNaTDCsodium taurodeoxycholateUPRunfolded protein responseERendoplasmic reticulum. is the predominant lipase secreted by the exocrine pancreas. PTL is the archetype of a lipase gene family that includes PTL and PLRP2 (1Cygler M. Schrag J.D. Sussman J.L. Harel M. Silman I. Gentry M.K. Doctor B.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 366-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Although the genes encoding PTL and PLRP2 reside in the same chromosomal location and likely diverged recently by gene duplication, they differ in their pattern of temporal expression during development in rodents and humans (2D'Agostino D. Lowe M.E. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 3Payne R.M. Sims H.F. Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G914-G921PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yang Y. Sanchez D. Figarella C. Lowe M.E. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 47: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In each species, mRNA encoding PLRP2 is expressed before birth and into adulthood, whereas the mRNA encoding PTL is not expressed in the fetal pancreas or at birth. The pattern of temporal expression led to the hypothesis that PLRP2 is critical for efficient dietary fat digestion in the newborn. Subsequently, it was shown that PLRP2-deficient mouse pups have significant fat maldigestion that disappears coincident with the expression of PTL thereby confirming the important role of PLRP2 in fat digestion in the newborn mouse (2D'Agostino D. Lowe M.E. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, efficient fat digestion was dependent on colipase, indicating that PLRP2 requires colipase in vivo (2D'Agostino D. Lowe M.E. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5Lowe M.E. Kaplan M.H. Jackson-Grusby L. D'Agostino D. Grusby M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31215-31221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).By analogy, PLRP2 should have an important role in dietary fat digestion in humans, but in vitro studies suggest that human PLRP2 may not function as a triglyceride lipase. Like PTL from all species, human PLRP2 activity against the major dietary long-chain triglycerides is inhibited by micellar bile salts (6Eydoux C. De Caro J. Ferrato F. Boullanger P. Lafont D. Laugier R. Carrière F. De Caro A. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1539-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Unlike PTL, the activity of human PLRP2 is not restored by the addition of another pancreatic protein, colipase. The poor activity of human PLRP2 against long-chain triglycerides raises questions about its ability to hydrolyze dietary fats, which are mostly long-chain triglycerides, in the duodenum where bile salt micelles reside. It has been suggested that triglycerides are not a physiological substrate for human PLRP2 and that the major role of human PLRP2 is as a galactolipase (7Amara S. Lafont D. Fiorentino B. Boullanger P. Carrière F. De Caro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Sias B. Ferrato F. Grandval P. Lafont D. Boullanger P. De Caro A. Leboeuf B. Verger R. Carrière F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10138-10148Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). If correct, the in vitro findings have important implications for the molecular details of in vivo dietary fat digestion in human newborns.Additionally, a nonsense polymorphism in the gene encoding human PLRP2 has previously been found in different ethnic populations, with the allele frequencies of 0.55, 0.53, and 0.33 for Africans, Caucasians, and Chinese, respectively (9Cao H. Hegele R.A. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 48: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The polymorphism results in the premature truncation of human PLRP2, W340X. The predicted protein lacks nearly the entire C-terminal domain of human PLRP2. Our earlier work has shown that the C-terminal domain of human PTL is required for its stability, efficient secretion, and full activity (10Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1029-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although human PLRP2 W340X may behave similarly to the truncated human PTL, it is unclear how the truncation impacts the biochemical function of human PLRP2. If human PLRP2 W340X has decreased secretion and activity, the role of PLRP2 in efficient fat digestion in newborns would be limited in subjects with the polymorphism.To reconcile the apparent contradictions among the rodent data, the human expression data, and the in vitro enzymatic properties of human PLRP2, we reexamined the in vitro properties of human PLRP2 to determine whether it can hydrolyze bile salt emulsions of long-chain triglycerides and if colipase increases activity under appropriate conditions. As a measure of the likelihood that any activity we detected with human PLRP2 was likely to be physiologically important, we compared the activity of human PLRP2 with that of human CEL, another lipase that contributes to fat digestion in the newborn (11Andersson Y. Sävman K. Bläckberg L. Hernell O. Acta Paediatr. 2007; 96: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Fredrikzon B. Hernell O. Bläckberg L. Olivecrona T. Pediatr.

We also determined the impact of the W340X mutation on the cell biology and activity of human PLRP2. We expressed the truncated protein in both yeast and cultured mammalian cells and measured the ability of the cells to secrete an active mutant. Because the majority of the mutant protein remained within the cells, we determined whether the UPR was activated in the transfected cells. Our findings provide new insights into the role of PLRP2 in dietary fat digestion in human newborns.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we reinvestigated the kinetic properties of human PLRP2 against long-chain substrates. Our results provide a plausible explanation for the differences between the reported in vitro properties of PLRP2 and the in vivo studies that show PLRP2 is essential for dietary fat digestion in newborn mice (5Lowe M.E. Kaplan M.H. Jackson-Grusby L. D'Agostino D. Grusby M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31215-31221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We found that human PLRP2 can effectively hydrolyze triolein emulsified in bile salt micelles in contrast to previous reports (6Eydoux C. De Caro J. Ferrato F. Boullanger P. Lafont D. Laugier R. Carrière F. De Caro A. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1539-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Sias B. Ferrato F. Grandval P. Lafont D. Boullanger P. De Caro A. Leboeuf B. Verger R. Carrière F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10138-10148Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activity of human PLRP2 was comparable with the activity of CEL, another lipase that contributes to dietary fat digestion in newborns. The apparent discrepancy between our results and prior studies is explained by a long lag time for maximum activity that exceeded the assay time in the previous studies. More importantly, the addition of oleic acids to the assay mixture eliminated the lag phase. In the duodenum, naturally occurring substrate emulsions contain digestion products like oleic acids, which result from digestion by gastric lipase in humans (21Carriere F. Barrowman J.A. Verger R. Laugier R. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 876-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Thus, the partially digested dietary fats are suitable substrates for human PLRP2.Lag phases have been commonly observed for lipolytic enzymes in the hydrolysis of substrates in emulsions, liposomes, and monolayers (22Borgström B. Gastroenterology. 1980; 78: 954-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23Verger R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 340-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 24Verger R. Borgstrom B. Brockman H.L. Lipases. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1984: 84-150Google Scholar, 25Brockman H.L. Law J.H. Kézdy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4965-4970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Larsson A. Erlanson-Albertsson C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 876: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The increased activity following the lag phase is probably due to increased absorption of PTL and colipase to the substrate interface induced by fatty acids released during the lag phase (22Borgström B. Gastroenterology. 1980; 78: 954-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27Wieloch T. Borgström B. Piéroni G. Pattus F. Verger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11523-11528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the elimination of the lag phase by fatty acids is well established, the mechanism remains uncertain. Initially, investigators speculated that fatty acids may change the properties of the lipid interface and increase absorption of colipase and PTL to the substrate (22Borgström B. Gastroenterology. 1980; 78: 954-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27Wieloch T. Borgström B. Piéroni G. Pattus F. Verger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11523-11528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, several lines of evidence suggest that mixed micelles of fatty acid and bile salt can form a high affinity complex with PTL and colipase. This tertiary complex may then absorb efficiently to the lipid interface (26Larsson A. Erlanson-Albertsson C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 876: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Freie A.B. Ferrato F. Carrière F. Lowe M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7793-7800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Patton J.S. Donnér J. Borgström B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 529: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5531-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Pignol D. Ayvazian L. Kerfelec B. Timmins P. Crenon I. Hermoso J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Chapus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4220-4224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).In the case of human PLRP2, we could not demonstrate increased absorption of human PLRP2 to an emulsion of bile salt and triolein in the presence of oleic acids. The effect of oleic acids on the lag phase likely occurs through another mechanism. One possibility is that oleic acid modifies the physical properties of the interface in a way that facilitates hydrolysis rather than absorption of the colipase-PLRP2 complex. Several models seem plausible. First, the fatty acids may alter the orientation of the colipase-PLRP2 complex on the interface. Second, they may aid diffusion of substrate into the active site. Alternatively, the presence of fatty acids may mediate the transition of human PLRP2 into an active conformation by stabilizing the lid domain in an open position.A second observation is also consistent with a model of oleic acid activation of human PLRP2 by a mechanism apart from increased absorption of the colipase-PLRP2 complex to substrate. The addition of oleic acids did not increase the effect of colipase on the absorption of human PLRP2 to substrate. In the presence and absence of oleic acids, colipase had a significantly lower apparent affinity for human PLRP2 than for human PTL. Several factors may contribute to the weak human PLRP2 interaction with colipase. Four residues in the human PTL lid domain, Arg-256, Asp-257, Tyr-267, and Lys-268, stabilize the open conformation of the lid domain in human PTL and are essential for a stable lipase-colipase interaction to occur (18Yang Y. Lowe M.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 48-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). None are conserved in human PLRP2, and substitution mutagenesis of the PTL residues to those of PLRP2 severely impairs the interaction with colipase (8Sias B. Ferrato F. Grandval P. Lafont D. Boullanger P. De Caro A. Leboeuf B. Verger R. Carrière F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10138-10148Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Yang Y. Lowe M.E. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 48-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the open conformation of the lid domain adopted by human PLRP2 likely differs considerably from that of PTL, and it may not be optimally situated to contribute to colipase binding (33Eydoux C. Spinelli S. Davis T.L. Walker J.R. Seitova A. Dhe-Paganon S. De Caro A. Cambillau C. Carrière F. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9553-9564Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Third, binding of colipase to the C-terminal domain of human PLRP2 may be decreased. Human PTL and PLRP2 share only 55% amino acid identity in the C-terminal domain, and some of these differences may affect colipase absorption to a lipid interface. Although the residues contributing to colipase binding as identified in the crystal structure of the colipase-PTL complex are conserved, other regions may be important (34van Tilbeurgh H. Bezzine S. Cambillau C. Verger R. Carrière F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For instance, the β5′-loop of human PTL likely influences the interaction of colipase and PTL (28Freie A.B. Ferrato F. Carrière F. Lowe M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7793-7800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 35Chahinian H. Bezzine S. Ferrato F. Ivanova M.G. Perez B. Lowe M.E. Carrière F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13725-13735Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Six of nine residues differ in this loop between human PTL and PLRP2.Even though human PLRP2 has decreased affinity for colipase, the presence of colipase is clearly required for activity against trioctanoin and triolein in the presence of 4 mm NaTDC. The effect of colipase on human PLRP2 activity against triolein was most apparent when oleic acids were included in the assay. The colipase dependence correlates with mouse studies showing that colipase is essential for dietary fat digestion in newborn mice and that PLRP2 accounts for the colipase-dependent lipase activity in the newborn mouse pancreas (2D'Agostino D. Lowe M.E. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36D'Agostino D. Cordle R.A. Kullman J. Erlanson-Albertsson C. Muglia L.J. Lowe M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7170-7177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).The human PLRP2 requirement for colipase to effectively hydrolyze trioctanoin and triolein is in distinct contrast to the lack of a colipase requirement for the hydrolysis of tributyrin, phospholipid, galactolipid, and retinyl-palmitate (6Eydoux C. De Caro J. Ferrato F. Boullanger P. Lafont D. Laugier R. Carrière F. De Caro A. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1539-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Andersson L. Carriére F. Lowe M.E. Nilsson A. Verger R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 38Reboul E. Berton A. Moussa M. Kreuzer C. Crenon I. Borel P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these substrates form mixed micelles with bile salts thereby presenting small aggregates in solution compared with the larger emulsion particles formed by trioctanoin and triolein (6Eydoux C. De Caro J. Ferrato F. Boullanger P. Lafont D. Laugier R. Carrière F. De Caro A. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1539-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the case of retinyl-palmitate, PLRP2 only hydrolyzes this substrate when it is in mixed micelles (38Reboul E. Berton A. Moussa M. Kreuzer C. Crenon I. Borel P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Clearly, human PLRP2 can interact effectively with substrate presented in a mixed micelle, but like PTL requires colipase to absorb onto substrate emulsions. We provided support for this possibility by directly measuring absorption of human PLRP2 to trioctanoin or triolein emulsions. Little to no human PLRP2 absorbed onto the emulsion unless colipase was present. It has been suggested that the increased mobility of the lid domain in PLRP2 compared with PTL contributes to the increased activity of PLRP2 against substrates that form small aggregates in solution (6Eydoux C. De Caro J. Ferrato F. Boullanger P. Lafont D. Laugier R. Carrière F. De Caro A. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1539-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Eydoux C.

Still, the molecular details of the differences in the interaction of human PLRP2 with mixed micelles and with emulsion particles remain unclear.We also noted one important difference in the properties of human PLRP2 expressed for this study and that previously reported. In our hands, human PLRP2 hydrolyzed diolein, and the activity depended on colipase in the presence of bile salt micelles. In the previous study, human PLRP2 had poor activity against diglycerides (6Eydoux C. De Caro J. Ferrato F. Boullanger P. Lafont D. Laugier R. Carrière F. De Caro A. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1539-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The explanation for the difference is not obvious. The diglycerides were from different sources, but the assay conditions were similar. Regardless, the ability of human PLRP2 to hydrolyze diglycerides in a complex with colipase is consistent with in vivo results of procolipase-deficient mice and PLRP2-deficient mice. In both cases, the feces of the deficient newborns contained abundant amounts of diglycerides (5Lowe M.E. Kaplan M.H. Jackson-Grusby L. D'Agostino D. Grusby M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31215-31221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36D'Agostino D. Cordle R.A. Kullman J. Erlanson-Albertsson C. Muglia L.J. Lowe M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7170-7177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Diglycerides were not detectable in the feces of wild-type newborns indicating that both colipase and PLRP2 are required for the in vivo digestion of diglycerides.Finally, we are the first research group to report the enzymatic properties and cell biology of a commonly occurring mutant of human PLRP2, W340X. Interestingly, in transformed yeast and transfected mammalian cells, the W340X mutant protein was largely retained inside the cells and only a minor fraction appeared in the medium. Although we were unable to purify W340X from the medium of yeast or mammalian cells to accurately characterize its enzymatic kinetics, assays of fresh or concentrated culture media consistently had low to undetectable levels of lipase activity suggesting PLRP2 W340X has little or no activity. The intracellular accumulation of W340X mutant protein further caused ER stress and triggered the UPR activation, as evidenced by elevated BiP protein levels in the cell lysate and XBP1 mRNA splicing. This provides evidence that PLRP2 W340X mutation may contribute to aberrant folding of the protein and may have other cellular effects along with the general loss of lipolytic activity. The ER stress induced by the synthesis of W340X might be partially relieved through degradation by proteosomes, as we showed that MG132 was capable of inhibiting the degradation of the mutant protein W340X but not wild-type human PLRP2.The W340X polymorphism in human PLRP2 may have important physiological implications. First, the secretory defect of PLRP2 W340X would cause a “loss of function” in dietary fat digestion in humans particularly in the newborn. Compared with other major lipases, PTL and CEL, PLRP2 is suitable to make a substantive contribution to dietary fat digestion during early infancy when PTL is absent and CEL is likely the major lipase. Human PLRP2 may play an even larger role in dietary fat digestion in newborns who consume formula, which does not contain CEL. Formula-fed newborn homozygous carriers of the W340X polymorphism would lack both breast milk CEL and PLRP2 and have less efficient dietary fat digestion. Importantly, the W340X mutation may account for the wide range of fat absorption seen in infants compared with older children and adults (39Fomon S.J. Ziegler E.E. Thomas L.N. Jensen R.L. Filer Jr., L.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1970; 23: 1299-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Second, the intracellular retention of PLRP2 W340X could place pancreatic acinar cells at greater risk for injury because of prolonged and chronic ER. The cellular consequence of the expression of human PLRP2 W340X needs to be further examined in pancreatic acinar cell lines, which are highly specialized in secretory protein synthesis and folding. Ultimately, for human PLRP2 W340X, both the putative loss of function as a lipase and gain of function as a toxic cellular stressor remain to be verified in vivo.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that human PLRP2 has sufficient activity against long-chain triglycerides to make a significant contribution to dietary fat digestion in human newborns. The higher activity and larger amounts of PTL secreted from the adult pancreas make it less likely that PLRP2 makes a significant contribution to triglyceride digestion in adults. In fact, PLRP2-deficient adult mice do not have detectable maldigestion of dietary triglycerides (5Lowe M.E. Kaplan M.H. Jackson-Grusby L. D'Agostino D. Grusby M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31215-31221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). More likely, PLRP2 functions to hydrolyze minor dietary fats like galactolipids or vitamin esters in the adult (6Eydoux C. De Caro J. Ferrato F. Boullanger P. Lafont D. Laugier R. Carrière F. De Caro A. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1539-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 38Reboul E. Berton A. Moussa M. Kreuzer C. Crenon I. Borel P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this regard, a recent report raises a question about the importance of PLRP2 as a galactolipase (40Hancock A.M. Witonsky D.B. Ehler E. Alkorta-Aranburu G. Beall C. Gebremedhin A. Sukernik R. Utermann G. Pritchard J. Coop G. Di Rienzo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 8924-8930Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The investigators found a strong correlation between the gene encoding PLRP2 W340X and populations where cereals are the main dietary component. They speculated that the truncated PLRP2 W340X was more active against plant lipids. Although our data do not address the activity of PLRP2 W340X on plant lipids, the near absence of secreted PLRP2 W340X from transfected cells makes it likely that PLRP2 W340X does not contribute to plant lipid digestion in humans. IntroductionPancreatic lipases are critical for efficient dietary fat digestion. Of the multiple pancreatic lipases, PTL 2The abbreviations used are: PTLpancreatic triglyceride lipaseCELcarboxyl ester lipaseERADER-associated degradationNaTDCsodium taurodeoxycholateUPRunfolded protein responseERendoplasmic reticulum. is the predominant lipase secreted by the exocrine pancreas. PTL is the archetype of a lipase gene family that includes PTL and PLRP2 (1Cygler M. Schrag J.D. Sussman J.L. Harel M. Silman I. Gentry M.K. Doctor B.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 366-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Although the genes encoding PTL and PLRP2 reside in the same chromosomal location and likely diverged recently by gene duplication, they differ in their pattern of temporal expression during development in rodents and humans (2D'Agostino D. Lowe M.E. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 3Payne R.M. Sims H.F. Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G914-G921PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yang Y. Sanchez D. Figarella C. Lowe M.E. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 47: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In each species, mRNA encoding PLRP2 is expressed before birth and into adulthood, whereas the mRNA encoding PTL is not expressed in the fetal pancreas or at birth. The pattern of temporal expression led to the hypothesis that PLRP2 is critical for efficient dietary fat digestion in the newborn. Subsequently, it was shown that PLRP2-deficient mouse pups have significant fat maldigestion that disappears coincident with the expression of PTL thereby confirming the important role of PLRP2 in fat digestion in the newborn mouse (2D'Agostino D. Lowe M.E. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, efficient fat digestion was dependent on colipase, indicating that PLRP2 requires colipase in vivo (2D'Agostino D. Lowe M.E. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5Lowe M.E. Kaplan M.H. Jackson-Grusby L. D'Agostino D. Grusby M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31215-31221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).By analogy, PLRP2 should have an important role in dietary fat digestion in humans, but in vitro studies suggest that human PLRP2 may not function as a triglyceride lipase. Like PTL from all species, human PLRP2 activity against the major dietary long-chain triglycerides is inhibited by micellar bile salts (6Eydoux C. De Caro J. Ferrato F. Boullanger P. Lafont D. Laugier R. Carrière F. De Caro A. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1539-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Unlike PTL, the activity of human PLRP2 is not restored by the addition of another pancreatic protein, colipase. The poor activity of human PLRP2 against long-chain triglycerides raises questions about its ability to hydrolyze dietary fats, which are mostly long-chain triglycerides, in the duodenum where bile salt micelles reside. It has been suggested that triglycerides are not a physiological substrate for human PLRP2 and that the major role of human PLRP2 is as a galactolipase (7Amara S. Lafont D. Fiorentino B. Boullanger P. Carrière F. De Caro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Sias B. Ferrato F. Grandval P. Lafont D. Boullanger P. De Caro A. Leboeuf B. Verger R. Carrière F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10138-10148Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). If correct, the in vitro findings have important implications for the molecular details of in vivo dietary fat digestion in human newborns.Additionally, a nonsense polymorphism in the gene encoding human PLRP2 has previously been found in different ethnic populations, with the allele frequencies of 0.55, 0.53, and 0.33 for Africans, Caucasians, and Chinese, respectively (9Cao H. Hegele R.A. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 48: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The polymorphism results in the premature truncation of human PLRP2, W340X. The predicted protein lacks nearly the entire C-terminal domain of human PLRP2. Our earlier work has shown that the C-terminal domain of human PTL is required for its stability, efficient secretion, and full activity (10Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1029-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although human PLRP2 W340X may behave similarly to the truncated human PTL, it is unclear how the truncation impacts the biochemical function of human PLRP2. If human PLRP2 W340X has decreased secretion and activity, the role of PLRP2 in efficient fat digestion in newborns would be limited in subjects with the polymorphism.To reconcile the apparent contradictions among the rodent data, the human expression data, and the in vitro enzymatic properties of human PLRP2, we reexamined the in vitro properties of human PLRP2 to determine whether it can hydrolyze bile salt emulsions of long-chain triglycerides and if colipase increases activity under appropriate conditions. As a measure of the likelihood that any activity we detected with human PLRP2 was likely to be physiologically important, we compared the activity of human PLRP2 with that of human CEL, another lipase that contributes to fat digestion in the newborn (11Andersson Y. Sävman K. Bläckberg L. Hernell O. Acta Paediatr. 2007; 96: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Fredrikzon B. Hernell O. Bläckberg L. Olivecrona T. Pediatr.

We also determined the impact of the W340X mutation on the cell biology and activity of human PLRP2. We expressed the truncated protein in both yeast and cultured mammalian cells and measured the ability of the cells to secrete an active mutant. Because the majority of the mutant protein remained within the cells, we determined whether the UPR was activated in the transfected cells. Our findings provide new insights into the role of PLRP2 in dietary fat digestion in human newborns."

In this work, we have employed steady-state and transient kinetics, together with equilibrium binding measurements to define the number of cation-binding sites and characterize their roles in the enzyme. Our results show that sodium and lithium ions stimulate enzyme activity, and that Na(+)-NQR enables pumping of Li(+), as well as Na(+) across the membrane. We also confirm that the enzyme is not able to translocate other monovalent cations, such as potassium or rubidium. Although potassium is not used as a substrate, Na(+)-NQR contains a regulatory site for this ion, which acts as a nonessential activator, increasing the activity and affinity for sodium. Rubidium can bind to the same site as potassium, but instead of being activated, enzyme turnover is inhibited. Activity measurements in the presence of both sodium and lithium indicate that the enzyme contains at least two functional sodium-binding sites. We also show that the binding sites are not exclusively responsible for ion selectivity, and other steps downstream in the mechanism also play a role. Finally, equilibrium-binding measurements with (22)Na(+) show that, in both its oxidized and reduced states, Na(+)-NQR binds three sodium ions, and that the affinity for sodium is the same for both of these states."
https://openalex.org/W2053344394,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a widely spread cutaneous chronic disease characterised by sensitive reactions (eg. eczema) to normally innocuous elements. Although relatively little is understood about its underlying mechanisms due to its complexity, skin barrier dysfunction has been recognised as a key factor in the development of AD. Skin barrier homeostasis requires tight control of the activity of proteases, called kallikreins (KLKs), whose activity is regulated by a complex network of protein interactions that remains poorly understood despite its pathological importance. Characteristic symptoms of AD include the outbreak of inflammation triggered by external (eg. mechanical and chemical) stimulus and the persistence and aggravation of inflammation even if the initial stimulus disappears. These characteristic symptoms, together with some experimental data, suggest the presence of positive feedback regulation for KLK activity by inflammatory signals. We developed simple mathematical models for the KLK activation system to study the effects of feedback loops and carried out bifurcation analysis to investigate the model behaviours corresponding to inflammation caused by external stimulus. The model analysis confirmed that the hypothesised core model mechanisms capture the essence of inflammation outbreak by a defective skin barrier. Our models predicted the outbreaks of inflammation at weaker stimulus and its longer persistence in AD patients compared to healthy control. We also proposed a novel quantitative indicator for inflammation level by applying principal component analysis to microarray data. The model analysis reproduced qualitative AD characteristics revealed by this indicator. Our results strongly implicate the presence and importance of feedback mechanisms in KLK activity regulation. We further proposed future experiments that may provide informative data to enhance the system-level understanding on the regulatory mechanisms of skin barrier in AD and healthy individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2123632263,"Bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) feed and breed in dead or severely weakened host trees. When their population densities are high, some species aggregate on healthy host trees so that their defences may be exhausted and the inner bark successfully colonized, killing the tree in the process. Here we investigate under what conditions participating with unrelated conspecifics in risky mass attacks on living trees is an adaptive strategy, and what this can tell us about bark beetle outbreak dynamics. We find that the outcome of individual host selection may deviate from the ideal free distribution in a way that facilitates the emergence of tree-killing (aggressive) behavior, and that any heritability on traits governing aggressiveness seems likely to exist in a state of flux or cycles consistent with variability observed in natural populations. This may have implications for how economically and ecologically important species respond to environmental changes in climate and landscape (forest) structure. The population dynamics emerging from individual behavior are complex, capable of switching between ""endemic"" and ""epidemic"" regimes spontaneously or following changes in host availability or resistance. Model predictions are compared to empirical observations, and we identify some factors determining the occurrence and self-limitation of epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W1968838650,"This study tests whether the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), combines favorably with ionizing radiation (IR) in controlling squamous carcinoma tumor growth. Animals bearing FaDu and A431 xenografts were treated with L-NNA in the drinking water. IR exposure was 10 Gy for tumor growth and survival studies and 4 Gy for ex vivo clonogenic assays. Cryosections were examined immunohistochemically for markers of apoptosis and hypoxia. Blood flow was assayed by fluorescent microscopy of tissue cryosections after i.v. injection of fluorospheres. Orally administered L-NNA for 24 hrs reduces tumor blood flow by 80% (p<0.01). Within 24 hrs L-NNA treatment stopped tumor growth for at least 10 days before tumor growth again ensued. The growth arrest was in part due to increased cell killing since a combination of L-NNA and a single 4 Gy IR caused 82% tumor cell killing measured by an ex vivo clonogenic assay compared to 49% by L-NNA or 29% by IR alone. A Kaplan-Meyer analysis of animal survival revealed a distinct survival advantage for the combined treatment. Combining L-NNA and IR was also found to be at least as effective as a single i.p. dose of cisplatin plus IR. In contrast to the in vivo studies, exposure of cells to L-NNA in vitro was without effect on clonogenicity with or without IR. Western and immunochemical analysis of expression of a number of proteins involved in NO signaling indicated that L-NNA treatment enhanced arginase-2 expression and that this may represent vasculature remodeling and escape from NOS inhibition. For tumors such as head and neck squamous carcinomas that show only modest responses to inhibitors of specific angiogenic pathways, targeting NO-dependent pro-survival and angiogenic mechanisms in both tumor and supporting stromal cells may present a potential new strategy for tumor control."
https://openalex.org/W1971726916,"Transglutaminase type 2 (TG2) catalyzes the formation of an ε-(γ-glutamyl)-lysine isopeptide bond between adjacent peptides or proteins including those of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Elevated extracellular TG2 leads to accelerated ECM deposition and reduced clearance that underlie tissue scarring and fibrosis. The extracellular trafficking of TG2 is crucial to its role in ECM homeostasis; however, the mechanism by which TG2 escapes the cell is unknown as it has no signal leader peptide and therefore cannot be transported classically. Understanding TG2 transport may highlight novel mechanisms to interfere with the extracellular function of TG2 as isoform-specific TG2 inhibitors remain elusive. Mammalian expression vectors were constructed containing domain deletions of TG2. These were transfected into three kidney tubular epithelial cell lines, and TG2 export was assessed to identify critical domains. Point mutation was then used to highlight specific sequences within the domain required for TG2 export. The removal of β-sandwich domain prevented all TG2 export. Mutations of Asp(94) and Asp(97) within the N-terminal β-sandwich domain were identified as crucial for TG2 externalization. These form part of a previously identified fibronectin binding domain ((88)WTATVVDQQDCTLSLQLTT(106)). However, siRNA knockdown of fibronectin failed to affect TG2 export. The sequence (88)WTATVVDQQDCTLSLQLTT(106) within the β-sandwich domain of TG2 is critical to its export in tubular epithelial cell lines. The extracellular trafficking of TG2 is independent of fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W2045155859,"As a consequence of their bacterial origin, mitochondria contain β-barrel proteins in their outer membrane (OMM). These proteins require the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex and the conserved sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) complex for transport and integration into the OMM. The SAM complex and the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) required for biogenesis of β-barrel proteins in bacteria are evolutionarily related. Despite this homology, we show that bacterial β-barrel proteins are not universally recognized and integrated into the OMM of human mitochondria. Selectivity exists both at the level of the TOM and the SAM complex. Of all of the proteins we tested, human mitochondria imported only β-barrel proteins originating from Neisseria sp., and only Omp85, the central component of the neisserial BAM complex, integrated into the OMM. PorB proteins from different Neisseria, although imported by the TOM, were not recognized by the SAM complex and formed membrane complexes only when functional Omp85 was present at the same time in mitochondria. Omp85 alone was capable of integrating other bacterial β-barrel proteins in human mitochondria, but could not substitute for the function of its mitochondrial homolog Sam50. Thus, signals and machineries for transport and assembly of β-barrel proteins in bacteria and human mitochondria differ enough to allow only a certain type of β-barrel proteins to be targeted and integrated in mitochondrial membranes in human cells."

Here we show that in AKAP150 (AKAP5) knock-out (KO) mice frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSC) and inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSC) are elevated at 2 weeks and, more modestly, 4 weeks of age in the hippocampal CA1 area versus litter mate WT mice. Linear spine density and ratio of AMPAR to NMDAR EPSC amplitudes were also increased. Amplitude and decay time of mEPSCs, decay time of mIPSCs, and spine size were unaltered. Mice in which the PKA anchoring C-terminal 36 residues of AKAP150 are deleted (D36) showed similar changes. Furthermore, whereas acute stimulation of PKA (2-4 h) increases spine density, prolonged PKA stimulation (48 h) reduces spine density in apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic slice cultures. The data from the AKAP150 mutant mice show that AKAP150-anchored PKA chronically limits the number of spines with functional AMPARs at 2-4 weeks of age. However, synaptic transmission and spine density was normal at 8 weeks in KO and D36 mice. Thus AKAP150-independent mechanisms correct the aberrantly high number of active spines in juvenile AKAP150 KO and D36 mice during development."

In contrast to other proteases, the understanding of Taspase1's (patho)biological relevance and function is limited, since neither small molecule inhibitors nor cell based functional assays for Taspase1 are currently available.Efficient cell-based assays to probe Taspase1 function in vivo are presented here. These are composed of glutathione S-transferase, autofluorescent protein variants, Taspase1 cleavage sites and rational combinations of nuclear import and export signals. The biosensors localize predominantly to the cytoplasm, whereas expression of biologically active Taspase1 but not of inactive Taspase1 mutants or of the protease Caspase3 triggers their proteolytic cleavage and nuclear accumulation. Compared to in vitro assays using recombinant components the in vivo assay was highly efficient. Employing an optimized nuclear translocation algorithm, the triple-color assay could be adapted to a high-throughput microscopy platform (Z'factor = 0.63). Automated high-content data analysis was used to screen a focused compound library, selected by an in silico pharmacophor screening approach, as well as a collection of fungal extracts. Screening identified two compounds, N-[2-[(4-amino-6-oxo-3H-pyrimidin-2-yl)sulfanyl]ethyl]benzenesulfonamide and 2-benzyltriazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid, which partially inhibited Taspase1 cleavage in living cells. Additionally, the assay was exploited to probe endogenous Taspase1 in solid tumor cell models and to identify an improved consensus sequence for efficient Taspase1 cleavage. This allowed the in silico identification of novel putative Taspase1 targets. Those include the FERM Domain-Containing Protein 4B, the Tyrosine-Protein Phosphatase Zeta, and DNA Polymerase Zeta. Cleavage site recognition and proteolytic processing of these substrates were verified in the context of the biosensor.The assay not only allows to genetically probe Taspase1 structure function in vivo, but is also applicable for high-content screening to identify Taspase1 inhibitors. Such tools will provide novel insights into Taspase1's function and its potential therapeutic relevance."

Method B cell epitopes of ADH were predicted by sequence and structure based methods and protein-protein interaction tools while T cell epitopes by inhibitory concentration and binding score methods. The epitopes were superimposed on a three dimensional model of ADH generated by homology modeling and analyzed for antigenic characteristics. Peptides corresponding to predicted epitopes were synthesized and immunoreactivity assessed by ELISA using individual and pooled patients' sera. Result The homology model showed GroES like catalytic domain joined to Rossmann superfamily domain by an alpha helix. Stereochemical quality was confirmed by Procheck which showed 90% residues in most favorable region of Ramachandran plot while Errat gave a quality score of 92.733%. Six B cell (P1–P6) and four T cell (P7–P10) epitopes were predicted by a combination of methods. Peptide P2 (epitope P2) showed E(X)2GGP(X)3KKI conserved pattern among allergens of pathogenesis related family. It was predicted as high affinity binder based on electronegativity and low hydrophobicity. The computational methods employed were validated using Bet v 1 and Der p 2 allergens where 67% and 60% of the epitope residues were predicted correctly. Among B cell epitopes, Peptide P2 showed maximum IgE binding with individual and pooled patients' sera (mean OD 0.604±0.059 and 0.506±0.0035, respectively) followed by P1, P4 and P3 epitopes. All T cell epitopes showed lower IgE binding. Conclusion Four B cell epitopes of C. lunata ADH were identified. Peptide P2 can serve as a potential candidate for diagnosis of allergic diseases."

Previous studies with Westerners have found that both the eyes and the mouth are crucial in identifying and interpreting smiles, yet less is known about Easterners. Here we reported that when asking the Chinese to judge the Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiles as either real or fake, their accuracy and sensitivity were negatively correlated with their individualism scores but positively correlated with their collectivism scores. However, such correlations were found only for participants who stated the eyes to be the most useful references, but not for those who favored the mouth. Moreover, participants who favored the eyes were more accurate and sensitive than those who favored the mouth. Our results thus indicate that Chinese who follow the typical Eastern decoding process of using the eyes as diagnostic cues to identify and interpret others' facial expressions and social intentions, are particularly accurate and sensitive, the more they self-report greater collectivistic and lower individualistic values."

The process by which a catalytic moiety is transferred across a membrane to enter the cytosol is not understood for any such toxin. BoNT is known to form pH-dependent pores important for the translocation of the catalytic domain into the cytosol. As a first step toward understanding this process, we investigated the mechanism by which the translocation domain of BoNT associates with a model liposome membrane. We report conditions that allow pH-dependent proteoliposome formation and identify a sequence at the translocation domain C terminus that is protected from proteolytic degradation in the context of the proteoliposome. Fluorescence quenching experiments suggest that residues within this sequence move to a hydrophobic environment upon association with liposomes. EPR analyses of spin-labeled mutants reveal major conformational changes in a distinct region of the structure upon association and indicate the formation of an oligomeric membrane-associated intermediate.

https://openalex.org/W2022465375,"Background The need for efficient algorithms to uncover biologically relevant phosphorylation motifs has become very important with rapid expansion of the proteomic sequence database along with a plethora of new information on phosphorylation sites. Here we present a novel unsupervised method, called Motif Finder (in short, F-Motif) for identification of phosphorylation motifs. F-Motif uses clustering of sequence information represented by numerical features that exploit the statistical information hidden in some foreground data. Furthermore, these identified motifs are then filtered to find “actual” motifs with statistically significant motif scores. Results and Discussion We have applied F-Motif to several new and existing data sets and compared its performance with two well known state-of-the-art methods. In almost all cases F-Motif could identify all statistically significant motifs extracted by the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, in addition to this, F-Motif uncovers several novel motifs. We have demonstrated using clues from the literature that most of these new motifs discovered by F-Motif are indeed novel. We have also found some interesting phenomena. For example, for CK2 kinase, the conserved sites appear only on the right side of S. However, for CDK kinase, the adjacent site on the right of S is conserved with residue P. In addition, three different encoding methods, including a novel position contrast matrix (PCM) and the simplest binary coding, are used and the ability of F-motif to discover motifs remains quite robust with respect to encoding schemes. Conclusions An iterative algorithm proposed here uses exploratory data analysis to discover motifs from phosphorylated data. The effectiveness of F-Motif has been demonstrated using several real data sets as well as using a synthetic data set. The method is quite general in nature and can be used to find other types of motifs also. We have also provided a server for F-Motif at http://f-motif.classcloud.org/, http://bio.classcloud.org/f-motif/ or http://ymu.classcloud.org/f-motif/."

https://openalex.org/W2153879827,"The protein kinase GSK-3 is constitutively active in quiescent cells in the absence of growth factor signaling. Previously, we identified a set of genes that required GSK-3 to maintain their repression during quiescence. Computational analysis of the upstream sequences of these genes predicted transcription factor binding sites for CREB, NFκB and AP-1. In our previous work, contributions of CREB and NFκB were examined. In the current study, the AP-1 component of the signaling network in quiescent cells was explored.Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, two AP-1 family members, c-Jun and JunD, bound to predicted upstream regulatory sequences in 8 of the 12 GSK-3-regulated genes. c-Jun was phosphorylated on threonine 239 by GSK-3 in quiescent cells, consistent with previous studies demonstrating inhibition of c-Jun by GSK-3. Inhibition of GSK-3 attenuated this phosphorylation, resulting in the stabilization of c-Jun. The association of c-Jun with its target sequences was increased by growth factor stimulation as well as by direct GSK-3 inhibition. The physiological role for c-Jun was also confirmed by siRNA inhibition of gene induction.These results indicate that inhibition of c-Jun by GSK-3 contributes to the repression of growth factor-inducible genes in quiescent cells. Together, AP-1, CREB and NFκB form an integrated transcriptional network that is largely responsible for maintaining repression of target genes downstream of GSK-3 signaling."

As proof-of-principle, we demonstrated the utility of the method for simultaneous detection of phosphorylated PDGFRβ and DUSP6/MKP-3 mRNA molecules in individual human fibroblasts upon PDGF-BB stimulation. Further we applied drugs disrupting the PDGFRβ signaling pathway at various sites to show that this combined method can concurrently monitor the molecular effect of the drugs, i.e. inhibition of downstream signaling from the targeted node in the signaling pathway. Due to its ability to detect different types of molecules in single cells in situ the method presented here can contribute to a deeper understanding of cell-to-cell variations and can be applied to e.g. pinpoint effector sites of drugs in a signaling pathway."

To identify the molecular mechanism responsible for this effect, the mouse Pdx-1 gene promoter (2.7 kb) was analyzed in β cell and non-β cell lines. Despite no apparent sterol regulatory element-binding protein-binding sites, the Pdx-1 promoter was suppressed by SREBP-1c in β cells in a dose-dependent manner. PDX-1 activated its own promoter. The E-box (-104/-99 bp) in the proximal region, occupied by ubiquitously expressed upstream stimulatory factors (USFs), was crucial for the PDX-1-positive autoregulatory loop through direct PDX-1·USF binding. This positive feedback activation was a prerequisite for SREBP-1c suppression of the promoter in non-β cells. SREBP-1c and PDX-1 directly interact through basic helix-loop-helix and homeobox domains, respectively. This robust SREBP-1c·PDX-1 complex interferes with PDX-1·USF formation and inhibits the recruitment of PDX-1 coactivators. SREBP-1c also inhibits PDX-1 binding to the previously described PDX-1-binding site (-2721/-2646 bp) in the distal enhancer region of the Pdx-1 promoter. Endogenous up-regulation of SREBP-1c in INS-1 cells through the activation of liver X receptor and retinoid X receptor by 9-cis-retinoic acid and 22-hydroxycholesterol inhibited PDX-1 mRNA and protein expression. Conversely, SREBP-1c RNAi restored Pdx-1 mRNA and protein levels. Through these multiple mechanisms, SREBP-1c, when induced in a lipotoxic state, repressed PDX-1 expression contributing to the inhibition of insulin expression and β cell dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W2018097104,"Humans can categorize objects in complex natural scenes within 100–150 ms. This amazing ability of rapid categorization has motivated many computational models. Most of these models require extensive training to obtain a decision boundary in a very high dimensional (e.g., ∼6,000 in a leading model) feature space and often categorize objects in natural scenes by categorizing the context that co-occurs with objects when objects do not occupy large portions of the scenes. It is thus unclear how humans achieve rapid scene categorization. To address this issue, we developed a hierarchical probabilistic model for rapid object categorization in natural scenes. In this model, a natural object category is represented by a coarse hierarchical probability distribution (PD), which includes PDs of object geometry and spatial configuration of object parts. Object parts are encoded by PDs of a set of natural object structures, each of which is a concatenation of local object features. Rapid categorization is performed as statistical inference. Since the model uses a very small number (∼100) of structures for even complex object categories such as animals and cars, it requires little training and is robust in the presence of large variations within object categories and in their occurrences in natural scenes. Remarkably, we found that the model categorized animals in natural scenes and cars in street scenes with a near human-level performance. We also found that the model located animals and cars in natural scenes, thus overcoming a flaw in many other models which is to categorize objects in natural context by categorizing contextual features. These results suggest that coarse PDs of object categories based on natural object structures and statistical operations on these PDs may underlie the human ability to rapidly categorize scenes."

Design A propaganda index consisting of 32 items was developed drawing on related literature. Seventeen subjects who review manuscripts for possible publication were requested to read five recent published reports of randomized controlled trials concerning social anxiety and to identify indicators of propaganda (defined as encouraging beliefs and actions with the least thought possible). They then re-read the same five articles using a propaganda index to note instances of propaganda. Data source Convenience sample of individuals who review manuscripts for possible publication and sample of recent published reports of randomized controlled trials regarding social anxiety in five different journals by different authors, blinded by author and journal. Results Data showed that there was a high rate of propagandistic problem framing in reports of RCTs regarding social anxiety such as hiding well argued alternative views and vagueness. This occurred in 117 out of 160 opportunities over five research reports. A convenience sample of 17 academics spotted only 4.5 percent of propaganda indicators. This increased to 64 percent with use of the 32 item propaganda index. Use of a propaganda index increased recognition of related indicators. However many instances remained undetected. Conclusion This propaganda index warrants further exploration as a complement to reporting guidelines such as CONSORT and PRISMA."
