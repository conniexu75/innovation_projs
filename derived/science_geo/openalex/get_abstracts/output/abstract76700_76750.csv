https://openalex.org/W2090429199,"FOR many years comparisons of moulting cycles in the Arthropoda have suffered from lack of a generally accepted terminology. The most ambiguous word, especially for Insecta, has been “moult”, which has been used to denote two completely different events in the cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1969955148,"IT is known that adrenaline accelerates glycogenolysis in liver and in muscles, which leads to an elevation of the concentration of blood sugar and blood lactate1. During work (and especially with high work loads) there is a substantial increase in the concentration of blood lactate, which is mainly produced in the working muscles2. This can in part arise from increased adrenergic activity during work. The purpose of the present investigation was to test this assumption by means of an adrenergic beta-blocking agent."

https://openalex.org/W2017406847,"THE stimulating action of insulin on the metabolism of heart and striated muscle is well known, but the extent of its influence on smooth muscle is less clear and is variously assessed1–8. Preparations so far studied—such as aortic muscle5—7 and intestinal segments4—suffer from the disadvantage that they are damaged during preparation or, like uterine muscle1–3, have a highly individual endocrine response. Because of its ease of dissection and less specialized function, guinea-pig taenia coli muscle seemed an obvious tissue preparation with which to investigate the possible in vitro effects of insulin."

In order to provide more information concerning the usefulness of this labelled compound for the localization and diagnosis of malignant tumours, we investigated its uptake by Ehrlich ascites tumours and sarcoma S-180 BALB."

https://openalex.org/W1991572117,"INFORMATION on the serum protein patterns of normal mice is necessary if these animals are to be used for studies in cellular immunity. However, except for Albritton's report1, in which no indication was made of the animal's age, sex and strain, such published data are not available. This communication, therefore, provides some of this essential information; we have found that there are differences in serum protein patterns in different groups of mice, and that these patterns are related to age and sex."
https://openalex.org/W2035376852,"MORPHOLOGICAL variations in the human eosinophil granule under electron microscopic examination have been recently recorded1. Furthermore, other variations in the eosinophil granule have been described before1. In fact, it seems probable that there are two or more different populations of granules."
