https://openalex.org/W2173818354,"During the course of a lifetime, somatic cells acquire mutations. Different mutational processes may contribute to the mutations accumulated in a cell, with each imprinting a mutational signature on the cell's genome. Some processes generate mutations throughout life at a constant rate in all individuals, and the number of mutations in a cell attributable to these processes will be proportional to the chronological age of the person. Using mutations from 10,250 cancer genomes across 36 cancer types, we investigated clock-like mutational processes that have been operating in normal human cells. Two mutational signatures show clock-like properties. Both exhibit different mutation rates in different tissues. However, their mutation rates are not correlated, indicating that the underlying processes are subject to different biological influences. For one signature, the rate of cell division may influence its mutation rate. This study provides the first survey of clock-like mutational processes operating in human somatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2195009776,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV underscores the threat of cross-species transmission events leading to outbreaks in humans. Here we examine the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations."

https://openalex.org/W2212967118,"A cortical parcellation technique accurately maps functional organization in individual brains. Functional networks mapped by this approach are highly reproducible and effectively capture individual variability. The algorithm performs well across different populations and data types and is validated by invasive cortical stimulation mapping in surgical patients. The capacity to identify the unique functional architecture of an individual's brain is a crucial step toward personalized medicine and understanding the neural basis of variation in human cognition and behavior. Here we developed a cortical parcellation approach to accurately map functional organization at the individual level using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A population-based functional atlas and a map of inter-individual variability were employed to guide the iterative search for functional networks in individual subjects. Functional networks mapped by this approach were highly reproducible within subjects and effectively captured the variability across subjects, including individual differences in brain lateralization. The algorithm performed well across different subject populations and data types, including task fMRI data. The approach was then validated by invasive cortical stimulation mapping in surgical patients, suggesting potential for use in clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2184968222,"Proprioception, the perception of body and limb position, is mediated by proprioceptors, specialized mechanosensory neurons that convey information about the stretch and tension experienced by muscles, tendons, skin and joints. In mammals, the molecular identity of the stretch-sensitive channel that mediates proprioception is unknown. We found that the mechanically activated nonselective cation channel Piezo2 was expressed in sensory endings of proprioceptors innervating muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs in mice. Two independent mouse lines that lack Piezo2 in proprioceptive neurons showed severely uncoordinated body movements and abnormal limb positions. Moreover, the mechanosensitivity of parvalbumin-expressing neurons that predominantly mark proprioceptors was dependent on Piezo2 expression in vitro, and the stretch-induced firing of proprioceptors in muscle-nerve recordings was markedly reduced in Piezo2-deficient mice. Together, our results indicate that Piezo2 is the major mechanotransducer of mammalian proprioceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2209731801,"Inflammasomes are high molecular weight protein complexes that assemble in the cytosol upon pathogen encounter. This results in caspase-1-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine maturation, as well as a special type of cell death, known as pyroptosis. The Nlrp3 inflammasome plays a pivotal role in pathogen defense, but at the same time, its activity has also been implicated in many common sterile inflammatory conditions. To this effect, several studies have identified Nlrp3 inflammasome engagement in a number of common human diseases such as atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer disease, or gout. Although it has been shown that known Nlrp3 stimuli converge on potassium ion efflux upstream of Nlrp3 activation, the exact molecular mechanism of Nlrp3 activation remains elusive. Here, we describe a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in immortalized mouse macrophages aiming at the unbiased identification of gene products involved in Nlrp3 inflammasome activation. We employed a FACS-based screen for Nlrp3-dependent cell death, using the ionophoric compound nigericin as a potassium efflux-inducing stimulus. Using a genome-wide guide RNA (gRNA) library, we found that targeting Nek7 rescued macrophages from nigericin-induced lethality. Subsequent studies revealed that murine macrophages deficient in Nek7 displayed a largely blunted Nlrp3 inflammasome response, whereas Aim2-mediated inflammasome activation proved to be fully intact. Although the mechanism of Nek7 functioning upstream of Nlrp3 yet remains elusive, these studies provide a first genetic handle of a component that specifically functions upstream of Nlrp3."
https://openalex.org/W2190015925,"Human cancer genome sequencing has recently revealed that genes that encode subunits of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are frequently mutated across a wide variety of cancers, and several subunits of the complex have been shown to have bona fide tumor suppressor activity. However, whether mutations in SWI/SNF subunits result in shared dependencies is unknown. Here we show that EZH2, a catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is essential in all tested cancer cell lines and xenografts harboring mutations of the SWI/SNF subunits ARID1A, PBRM1, and SMARCA4, which are several of the most frequently mutated SWI/SNF subunits in human cancer, but that co-occurrence of a Ras pathway mutation is correlated with abrogation of this dependence. Notably, we demonstrate that SWI/SNF-mutant cancer cells are primarily dependent on a non-catalytic role of EZH2 in the stabilization of the PRC2 complex, and that they are only partially dependent on EZH2 histone methyltransferase activity. These results not only reveal a shared dependency of cancers with genetic alterations in SWI/SNF subunits, but also suggest that EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors now in clinical development may not fully suppress the oncogenic activity of EZH2."
https://openalex.org/W2199129392,"Climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells are thought to be involved in generating the instructive signals that drive cerebellar learning. To investigate how these instructive signals are encoded, we recorded the activity of individual climbing fibers during cerebellum-dependent eyeblink conditioning in mice. We found that climbing fibers signaled both the unexpected delivery and the unexpected omission of the periocular airpuff that served as the instructive signal for eyeblink conditioning. In addition, we observed that climbing fibers activated by periocular airpuffs also responded to stimuli from other sensory modalities if those stimuli were novel or if they predicted that the periocular airpuff was about to be presented. This pattern of climbing fiber activity is markedly similar to the responses of dopamine neurons during reinforcement learning, which have been shown to encode a particular type of instructive signal known as a temporal difference prediction error."
https://openalex.org/W2237018933,"HIV-1 infection results in a chronic illness because long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy can lower viral titers to an undetectable level. However, discontinuation of therapy rapidly increases virus burden. Moreover, patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy frequently develop various metabolic disorders, neurocognitive abnormalities, and cardiovascular diseases. We have previously shown that exosomes containing trans-activating response (TAR) element RNA enhance susceptibility of undifferentiated naive cells to HIV-1 infection. This study indicates that exosomes from HIV-1-infected primary cells are highly abundant with TAR RNA as detected by RT-real time PCR. Interestingly, up to a million copies of TAR RNA/Î¼l were also detected in the serum from HIV-1-infected humanized mice suggesting that TAR RNA may be stable in vivo. Incubation of exosomes from HIV-1-infected cells with primary macrophages resulted in a dramatic increase of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-Î², indicating that exosomes containing TAR RNA could play a direct role in control of cytokine gene expression. The intact TAR molecule was able to bind to PKR and TLR3 effectively, whereas the 5â² and 3â² stems (TAR microRNAs) bound best to TLR7 and -8 and none to PKR. Binding of TAR to PKR did not result in its phosphorylation, and therefore, TAR may be a dominant negative decoy molecule in cells. The TLR binding through either TAR RNA or TAR microRNA potentially can activate the NF-ÎºB pathway and regulate cytokine expression. Collectively, these results imply that exosomes containing TAR RNA could directly affect the proinflammatory cytokine gene expression and may explain a possible mechanism of inflammation observed in HIV-1-infected patients under cART."
https://openalex.org/W2140862281,"We screened a panel of mouse and human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against chikungunya virus and identified several with inhibitory activity against multiple alphaviruses. Passive transfer of broadly neutralizing MAbs protected mice against infection by chikungunya, Mayaro, and O'nyong'nyong alphaviruses. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, loss-of-function recombinant proteins and viruses, and multiple functional assays, we determined that broadly neutralizing MAbs block multiple steps in the viral lifecycle, including entry and egress, and bind to a conserved epitope on the B domain of the E2 glycoprotein. A 16 Ã resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of a Fab fragment bound to CHIKV E2 B domain provided an explanation for its neutralizing activity. Binding to the B domain was associated with repositioning of the A domain of E2 that enabled cross-linking of neighboring spikes. Our results suggest that B domain antigenic determinants could be targeted for vaccine or antibody therapeutic development against multiple alphaviruses of global concern."
https://openalex.org/W2194931157,"Neuropathic pain is a debilitating clinical problem and difficult to treat. Nerve injury causes a long-lasting reduction in K(+) channel expression in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), but little is known about the epigenetic mechanisms involved. We found that nerve injury increased dimethylation of Lys9 on histone H3 (H3K9me2) at Kcna4, Kcnd2, Kcnq2 and Kcnma1 promoters but did not affect levels of DNA methylation on these genes in DRGs. Nerve injury increased activity of euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase-2 (G9a), histone deacetylases and enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2), but only G9a inhibition consistently restored K(+) channel expression. Selective knockout of the gene encoding G9a in DRG neurons completely blocked K(+) channel silencing and chronic pain development after nerve injury. Remarkably, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that G9a inhibition not only reactivated 40 of 42 silenced genes associated with K(+) channels but also normalized 638 genes down- or upregulated by nerve injury. Thus G9a has a dominant function in transcriptional repression of K(+) channels and in acute-to-chronic pain transition after nerve injury."
https://openalex.org/W2149697128,"Introduction Although psychotherapies for depression produce equivalent outcomes, individual patients respond differently to different therapies. Predictors of outcome have been identified in the context of randomized trials, but this information has not been used to predict which treatment works best for the depressed individual. In this paper, we aim to replicate a recently developed treatment selection method, using data from an RCT comparing the effects of cognitive therapy (CT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Methods 134 depressed patients completed the pre- and post-treatment BDI-II assessment. First, we identified baseline predictors and moderators. Second, individual treatment recommendations were generated by combining the identified predictors and moderators in an algorithm that produces the Personalized Advantage Index (PAI), a measure of the predicted advantage in one therapy compared to the other, using standard regression analyses and the leave-one-out cross-validation approach. Results We found five predictors (gender, employment status, anxiety, personality disorder and quality of life) and six moderators (somatic complaints, cognitive problems, paranoid symptoms, interpersonal self-sacrificing, attributional style and number of life events) of treatment outcome. The mean average PAI value was 8.9 BDI points, and 63% of the sample was predicted to have a clinically meaningful advantage in one of the therapies. Those who were randomized to their predicted optimal treatment (either CT or IPT) had an observed mean end-BDI of 11.8, while those who received their predicted non-optimal treatment had an end-BDI of 17.8 (effect size for the difference = 0.51). Discussion Depressed patients who were randomized to their predicted optimal treatment fared much better than those randomized to their predicted non-optimal treatment. The PAI provides a great opportunity for formal decision-making to improve individual patient outcomes in depression. Although the utility of the PAI approach will need to be evaluated in prospective research, this study promotes the development of a treatment selection approach that can be used in regular mental health care, advancing the goals of personalized medicine."

https://openalex.org/W2178323098,"Acidification is required for the function of many intracellular organelles, but methods to acutely manipulate their intraluminal pH have not been available. Here we present a targeting strategy to selectively express the light-driven proton pump Arch3 on synaptic vesicles. Our new tool, pHoenix, can functionally replace endogenous proton pumps, enabling optogenetic control of vesicular acidification and neurotransmitter accumulation. Under physiological conditions, glutamatergic vesicles are nearly full, as additional vesicle acidification with pHoenix only slightly increased the quantal size. By contrast, we found that incompletely filled vesicles exhibited a lower release probability than full vesicles, suggesting preferential exocytosis of vesicles with high transmitter content. Our subcellular targeting approach can be transferred to other organelles, as demonstrated for a pHoenix variant that allows light-activated acidification of lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2110319273,"The DISC1 protein is implicated in major mental illnesses including schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, and autism. Aberrant mitochondrial dynamics are also associated with major mental illness. DISC1 plays a role in mitochondrial transport in neuronal axons, but its effects in dendrites have yet to be studied. Further, the mechanisms of this regulation and its role in neuronal development and brain function are poorly understood. Here we have demonstrated that DISC1 couples to the mitochondrial transport and fusion machinery via interaction with the outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase proteins Miro1 and Miro2, the TRAK1 and TRAK2 mitochondrial trafficking adaptors, and the mitochondrial fusion proteins (mitofusins). Using live cell imaging, we show that disruption of the DISC1-Miro-TRAK complex inhibits mitochondrial transport in neurons. We also show that the fusion protein generated from the originally described DISC1 translocation (DISC1-Boymaw) localizes to the mitochondria, where it similarly disrupts mitochondrial dynamics. We also show by super resolution microscopy that DISC1 is localized to endoplasmic reticulum contact sites and that the DISC1-Boymaw fusion protein decreases the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact area. Moreover, disruption of mitochondrial dynamics by targeting the DISC1-Miro-TRAK complex or upon expression of the DISC1-Boymaw fusion protein impairs the correct development of neuronal dendrites. Thus, DISC1 acts as an important regulator of mitochondrial dynamics in both axons and dendrites to mediate the transport, fusion, and cross-talk of these organelles, and pathological DISC1 isoforms disrupt this critical function leading to abnormal neuronal development."
https://openalex.org/W2165388780,"Polypharmacy is a problem of growing interest in geriatrics with the increase in drug consumption in recent years, is defined according to the WHO criteria as the, ''concurrent use of five or more different prescription medication"". We investigated the clinical characteristics of polypharmacy and identified the effects of polypharmacy on clinical outcome among patients aged 80+ admitted to Chinese PLA general hospital.Older men aged â¥80 years (n = 1562) were included in this study. The included participants attended a structured clinical examination and an interview carried out by a geriatrician and trained nurses. A follow-up survey in 2014 was carried out on survivors in the same way as in 2009. The clinical outcome measured were adverse drug reactions, falls, frailty, disability, cognitive impairment, mortality. The association between polypharmacy and clinical outcome was assessed by logistic regression.The mean (range) age of the included participants was 85.2 (80-104) years. Medication exposure was reported by 100% of the population. Mean number of medications reported in this population was 9.56Â±5.68. The prevalence of polypharmacy (â¥6 medications) in the present study was 70%. At the time of the follow-up survey, an increase in the number of taken medicines had occurred among half of the survivors. The risk of different outcomes in relation to number of medications rises significantly, the odds ratios were 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI]1.17-1.28) for adverse drug reactions, 1.18 (95% CI 1.10-1.26) for falls, 1.16 (95% CI 1.09-1.24) for disability, and 1.19 (95% CI 1.12-1.23) for mortality. There was no association between increasing number of medications and cognitive impairment.Our study demonstrates that polypharmacy is very common in the very old patients, and observed that number of medications was a factor associated with difference clinical outcome independently of the age, type of medications prescribed and accompanied comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2121303526,"Emerging evidence demonstrates how inadequate access to water and sanitation is linked to psychosocial stress, especially among women, forcing them to navigate social and physical barriers during their daily sanitation routines. We examine sanitation-related psychosocial stress (SRPS) across women's reproductive lives in three distinct geographic sites (urban slums, rural villages, and rural tribal villages) in Odisha, India. We explored daily sanitation practices of adolescent, newly married, pregnant, and established adult women (n = 60) and identified stressors encountered during sanitation. Responding to structured data collection methods, women ranked seven sanitation activities (defecation, urination, menstruation, bathing, post-defecation cleaning, carrying water, and changing clothes) based on stress (high to low) and level of freedom (associated with greatest freedom to having the most restrictions). Women then identified common stressors they encountered when practicing sanitation and sorted stressors in constrained piles based on frequency and severity of each issue. The constellation of factors influencing SRPS varies by life stage and location. Overall, sanitation behaviors that were most restricted (i.e., menstruation) were the most stressful. Women in different sites encountered different stressors, and the level of perceived severity varied based on site and life stage. Understanding the influence of place and life stage on SRPS provides a nuanced understanding of sanitation, and may help identify areas for intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2145662953,"Acid ceramidase (AC) is a lysosomal cysteine amidase that controls sphingolipid signaling by lowering the levels of ceramides and concomitantly increasing those of sphingosine and its bioactive metabolite, sphingosine 1-phosphate. In the present study, we evaluated the role of AC-regulated sphingolipid signaling in melanoma. We found that AC expression is markedly elevated in normal human melanocytes and proliferative melanoma cell lines, compared with other skin cells (keratinocytes and fibroblasts) and non-melanoma cancer cells. High AC expression was also observed in biopsies from human subjects with Stage II melanoma. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that the subcellular localization of AC differs between melanocytes (where it is found in both cytosol and nucleus) and melanoma cells (where it is primarily localized to cytosol). In addition to having high AC levels, melanoma cells generate lower amounts of ceramides than normal melanocytes do. This down-regulation in ceramide production appears to result from suppression of the de novo biosynthesis pathway. To test whether AC might contribute to melanoma cell proliferation, we blocked AC activity using a new potent (IC50 = 12 nM) and stable inhibitor. AC inhibition increased cellular ceramide levels, decreased sphingosine 1-phosphate levels, and acted synergistically with several, albeit not all, antitumoral agents. The results suggest that AC-controlled sphingolipid metabolism may play an important role in the control of melanoma proliferation."

The molybdenum-containing, NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenases from bacteria such as Ralstonia eutropha catalyze the oxidation of formate to CO2, reducing NAD+ to NADH, and are members of the NADH dehydrogenase superfamily of enzymes. These cytosolic formate dehydrogenases are expressed under aerobic conditions and are distinct from the predominant bacterial formate dehydrogenases expressed under anaerobic conditions, which are typically membrane-associated and extremely O2-sensitive; they are also distinct from the cofactorless formate dehydrogenases from many eukaryotes, including humans, that catalyze the direct hydride transfer from formate to NAD+ (1Hille R. Hall J. Basu P. The mononuclear molybdenum enzymes.Chem. Rev. 2014; 114: 3963-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In R. eutropha, the trimeric FdsABG (soluble, NAD+-dependent, molybdenum-containing formate dehydrogenase, product of the fdsABG gene cluster) enzyme is encoded by the fdsGBACD operon and is predicted to contain seven iron/sulfur clusters, FMN, and a molybdenum center; each subunit bears significant sequence similarity (â¼21% identity) and expected strong structural homology to a corresponding subunit of the matrix- or cytosol-exposed portion of NADH dehydrogenase, and the spatial layout of the several redox-active centers is particularly highly conserved.

The close structural homology predicted between FdsA and Nqo3 extends to the presence of a histidine ligand to one of the [4Fe-4S] clusters near the N terminus of the FdsA/Nqo3 subunit.

Frozen cells, typically 48â52 g of wet weight, were thawed, suspended in 2â2.5 volumes of enzyme buffer, and disrupted by 1â2 passages through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 200,000 Ã g. The supernatant was made 29% saturated in ammonium sulfate and centrifuged for an additional 45 min at 200,000 Ã g. The 29% fraction was then brought to 46% ammonium sulfate saturation. After centrifugation, the pellet containing FdsABG was dissolved in 80 mm K-PO4, 20 mm KNO3, pH 8.0 (saturated with 15% ammonium sulfate), at 0.4 ml/g cells to maintain a relatively small loading volume to minimize peak spreading. Supernatant treated in this fashion was loaded onto a 2.6 Ã 16-cm butyl 4-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), the column was washed with 0.5 column volume of 40 mm K-PO4, 10 mm KNO3, 0.7 m ammonium sulfate, pH 7.3 (HIC-A), and the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.7â0 m ammonium sulfate over 4 column volumes. Active fractions (see assay conditions below) were pooled, and the protein was precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation the pellet was redissolved in 80 mm K-PO4, 20 mm KNO3, pH 8.0, and loaded onto a 2.6 Ã 20-cm G-50 desalting column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm KNO3, pH 7.4. Fractions from the desalting column were loaded onto a 2.6 Ã 14 cm Cibacron Blue-agarose 3GA, Type 3000-CL column (Sigma-Aldrich). Under these conditions, FdsABG did not bind to the gel matrix and eluted in the flowthrough. The resulting fractions were applied to a 2.6 Ã 14-cm Fractogel TMAE 650 (S) column (EMD-Millipore), washed with 2 column volumes of 40 mm K-PO4, 10 mm KNO3, pH 7.0, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0â0.6 m NaCl over 5 column volumes. Active fractions were pooled and divided into two halves, and the protein was precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation, one pellet was redissolved in 0.5 ml of HIC-A buffer, loaded onto a 5 ml butyl-Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare), washed with 0.5 column volume HIC-A buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.5â0 m ammonium sulfate over 4 column volumes. The process was repeated with the second pellet. Both HIC steps were complicated by significant peak spreading; thus total column volumes were minimized to obtain optimal resolution. The active fractions were precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate, redissolved, and loaded unto 1.6 Ã 60-cm Superdex 200 PG column (GE Healthcare) in buffer containing 300 mm KCl. Fractions containing only the dimer of the heterotrimer (with a molecular mass of â¼358 kDa) were precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate, redissolved, and buffer-exchanged into storage buffer: 75 mm K-PO4, 10 mm KNO3, pH 7.5 via Amicon Ultra 4 (Millipore). Concentrated protein was flash frozen and stored in liquid N2. Activity assays were performed at 30 Â°C in 75 mm K-PO4, pH 7.7, with 2 mm NAD+ and 40 mm sodium formate; formation of NADH was monitored at 340 nm (Ïµ = 6,220 mâ1 cmâ1). One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the reduction of 1 Î¼mol of NAD+ per min. Typically, 10 s were used to calculate the initial slope. Enzyme concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient of E410 nm = 51,500 mâ1 cmâ1 estimated from the oxidized enzyme spectrum published by Friedebold et al. (10Friedebold J. Bowien B. Physiological and biochemical characterization of the soluble formate dehydrogenase, a molybdoenzyme from Alcaligenes eutrophus.J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4719-4728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); activities were calculated with respect to one trimer with a molecular mass of 178,800 Da. Purified protein exhibited 70 units of activity per mg of protein, in good agreement with 80 units per mg obtained by Friedebold et al. (10Friedebold J. Bowien B. Physiological and biochemical characterization of the soluble formate dehydrogenase, a molybdoenzyme from Alcaligenes eutrophus.J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4719-4728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activity measurements and absorbance spectra were performed using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted cell holder. Steady-state measurements collected at a range of pH values yielded a bell-shaped curve that was fitted to the equation for a double-ionization mechanism, Lobs=Lmax/[1+([H+]/10(âpka1))+(10(âpka2)/[H+])](Eq. 1) with the maximum theoretical value for L (Lmax), and the two pKa values (pKa1 and pKa2) obtained using PeakFit ver. 4 (Jandel Scientific). Reductive titrations were performed with 20 mm buffered sodium dithionite and 20 Î¼m enzyme in 75 mm K-PO4, pH 7.7, under anaerobic conditions at RT. Prior to titrations the enzyme was exchanged into anaerobic 75 mm K-PO4, pH 7.7, to remove nitrate via Amicon Ultra 4 (Millipore). The reaction of oxidized FdsABG with formate was followed using a SX-20 stopped flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, Inc.) equipped with photodiode array and photomultiplier tube detection and running ProData SX 2.2.5.6 acquisition software. The enzyme was exchanged into anaerobic 75 mm K-PO4, pH 7.7, to remove nitrate via Amicon Ultra 4 (Millipore) prior to use. As long as the enzyme was kept under anaerobic conditions, it could be maintained for 3â4 h without significant loss of activity. Friedebold et al. (10Friedebold J. Bowien B. Physiological and biochemical characterization of the soluble formate dehydrogenase, a molybdoenzyme from Alcaligenes eutrophus.J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4719-4728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that nitrate binding followed a mixed competitive-noncompetitive type inhibition. It is possible that nitrate binding at the molybdenum site blocks O2 from affecting the removal of the catalytically essential apical sulfur ligand (9Schrapers P. Hartmann T. Kositzki R. Dau H. Reschke S. Schulzke C. LeimkÃ¼hler S. Haumann M. Sulfido and cysteine ligation changes at the molybdenum cofactor during substrate conversion by formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Rhodobacter capsulatus.Inorg. Chem. 2015; 54: 3260-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) by some as yet unknown mechanism. Time courses for the reaction were monitored at 450 nm at 10 Â°C and fitted to a sum of three exponentials by nonlinear least squares regression analysis to the following equation, At=AâÂ±âAnexp(ât/Kn)(Eq. 2) where n refers to the number of kinetic phases observed. Analysis of time courses was performed using the software ProData Viewer 4.2.0 (Applied Photophysics, Inc). The observed rate constants, kobs, were plotted against substrate concentrations to obtain the limiting rate constant for reduction, kred, and the dissociation constant, Kd, using the following equation. kobs=kred[S]/(Kd+[S])(Eq. 3) MoV-containing EPR samples were prepared in 75 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, in the presence of 10 mm KNO3 unless otherwise stated. MoV-containing spectra could be obtained upon reduction of the enzyme with either sodium dithionite or sodium formate, although the relative signal intensities of the MoV and several iron/sulfur signals depended to some degree on both the extent of reduction and the reductant used. Maximum accumulation of MoV EPR signal was obtained when the enzyme was â¼50% reduced (by addition of â¼5e equivalents), although additional reduction did not significantly affect MoV yield as long as the sample was frozen promptly. Nitrate had no effect on the shape of the EPR signals, although the yield of MoV EPR signal was typically reduced in the absence of nitrate, even when nitrate was removed under anaerobic conditions (likely because of a loss of activity during nitrate removal). No MoV EPR signal was observed when samples were prepared from protein that had been incubated aerobically in the absence of nitrate for at least 6 h at 4 Â°C (at which point virtually all of the enzymatic activity was lost). When necessary, buffer exchange was accomplished by concentrating protein samples, diluting with appropriate buffer, and reconcentrating via Amicon Ultra 4 (Millipore). Samples were made anaerobic at 4 Â°C (5â7 Â°C for deuterated samples) and transferred to argon-flushed, septum-sealed EPR tubes. Samples prepared in this way were subsequently frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath and transferred to liquid nitrogen. Further details of sample preparation are included in figure captions. EPR spectra were recorded using a BrÃ¼ker EMX spectrometer equipped with a BrÃ¼ker ER 4119HS high sensitivity X-band cavity and gaussmeter, operating WinEPR version 4.33 acquisition software. Temperature was controlled using a BrÃ¼ker variable temperature unit and liquid nitrogen or liquid helium cryostat. For purposes of comparison, all spectra were adjusted to the same microwave frequency by converting the magnetic field values for each individual spectrum to g values using the equation, g=71.4484Ãv/B(Eq. 4) where v is in GHz, and B is in mT, and then back to mT using a microwave frequency of 9.475 GHz. Detailed instrument settings are included in figure captions. Simulations were performed using the EasySpin 4.5.5 software package (12Stoll S. Schweiger A. EasySpin, a comprehensive software package for spectral simulation and analysis in EPR.J. Magn. Reson. 2006; 178: 42-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4174) Google Scholar). For MoV-containing spectra, Euler angles relating the g and A tensor frames were empirically obtained and fixed during final simulations. During simulations of MoV-containing spectra, g values for the iron/sulfur clusters were allowed to vary by no more than Â± 0.001, whereas anisotropic line broadening (simulated as HStrain in the EasySpin software package) varied by no more than Â± 10 MHz. Iron/sulfur linewidths used in the molybdenum-containing spectra were initially estimated from experimental spectra that contained the various iron/sulfur components at the temperatures where the molybdenum-containing spectra were obtained. These estimates were then used as starting points for simulation of the molybdenum-containing spectra. Neither the g nor the A tensors were generally affected by the way in which the linewidths were treated; only the relative contribution of each component to the composite spectra was sometimes affected. Because of the complexity of the composite spectra, no attempts were made to quantify the effects of temperature on the linewidths of the various signals. Every multicomponent simulation included a âweightâ term, which could be used to estimate the relative contribution of each component to the composite spectrum. Electron-electron interactions between MoV and Fe/S3 were simulated using an S = 1/2 spin system. The electron-electron spin-spin interaction module in EasySpin does not allow variable linewidths for the interacting sites, and at 20 K the linewidth of the g2 tensor of Fe/S3 is 1.5Ã greater than of the corresponding MoV. Initially, only the anisotropic splitting at g2 of the MoV (no interactions were apparent at g1 or g3) was simulated. After the initial simulation, the resulting value for the MoV could be fixed for the interacting Fe/S3 as well. Because of the broad nature of the iron/sulfur centers, the exclusion of electron-electron coupling for the Fe/S3 did not have a discernible effect on either the accuracy of the simulation or the resultant parameters. FdsABG, isolated as described under âExperimental Procedures,â has the absorption spectrum shown in Fig. 1A, in good agreement with previous reports (4Oh J.I. Bowien B.

The oxidized, as-isolated enzyme absorbs throughout the visible region, as expected given the large number of chromophores present, and has a broad shoulder at â¼450 nm that is attributable to the FMN cofactor. A reductive titration with sodium dithionite results in a systematic bleaching of this absorbance throughout the UV-visible region (Fig. 1B). A plot of the fractional absorbance change at 550 nm, where reduction of the iron/sulfur clusters is expected to predominate, versus that at 450 nm, where reduction of the FMN predominates, provides information regarding the relative order of reduction (because of the relative reduction potentials) of the FMN relative to the iron/sulfur clusters. As has been shown previously in related systems (13Olson J.S. Ballou D.P. Palmer G. Massey V. Mechanism of action of xanthine oxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4363-4382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a deflection from the diagonal (reflecting strict proportionality in the absorbance changes at the two wavelengths) up and to the left reflects earlier reduction of Fe/S clusters relative to FMN and a deflection down and to the right the reverse. As indicated in the inset to Fig. 1B, the plot shows a deflection up and to the left from the diagonal, indicating that the FMN becomes fully reduced later rather than earlier in the course of the titration relative to the iron/sulfur clusters. This suggests that the FMN has a relatively low reduction potential relative to the iron/sulfur clusters. Also consistent with previous reports (4Oh J.I. Bowien B.

https://openalex.org/W2113032366,"Pre-eclampsia (PE) complicates around 3% of all pregnancies and is one of the most common causes of maternal mortality worldwide. The pathophysiology of PE remains unclear however its underlying cause originates from the placenta and manifests as raised blood pressure, proteinuria, vascular or systemic inflammation and hypercoagulation in the mother. Women who develop PE are also at significantly higher risk of subsequently developing cardiovascular (CV) disease. In PE, the failing endoplasmic reticulum, oxidative and inflammatory stressed syncytiotrophoblast layer of the placenta sheds increased numbers of syncytiotrophoblast extracellular vesicles (STBEV) into the maternal circulation. Platelet reactivity, size and concentration are also known to be altered in some women who develop PE, although the underlying reasons for this have not been determined. In this study we show that STBEV from disease free placenta isolated ex vivo by dual placental perfusion associate rapidly with platelets. We provide evidence that STBEV isolated from normal placentas cause platelet activation and that this is increased with STBEV from PE pregnancies. Furthermore, treatment of platelets with aspirin, currently prescribed for women at high risk of PE to reduce platelet aggregation, also inhibits STBEV-induced reversible aggregation of washed platelets. Increased platelet reactivity as a result of exposure to PE placenta derived STBEVs correlates with increased thrombotic risk associated with PE. These observations establish a possible direct link between the clotting disturbances of PE and dysfunction of the placenta, as well as the known increased risk of thromboembolism associated with this condition."
https://openalex.org/W2114967662,"Fibrosis is characterized by extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and stiffening. However, the functional contribution of tissue stiffening to noncancer pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Fibronectin (Fn) is an ECM glycoprotein substantially expressed during tissue repair. Here we show in advanced chronic liver fibrogenesis using a mouse model lacking Fn that, unexpectedly, Fn-null livers lead to more extensive liver cirrhosis, which is accompanied by increased liver matrix stiffness and deteriorated hepatic functions. Furthermore, Fn-null livers exhibit more myofibroblast phenotypes and accumulate highly disorganized/diffuse collagenous ECM networks composed of thinner and significantly increased number of collagen fibrils during advanced chronic liver damage. Mechanistically, mutant livers show elevated local TGF-Î² activity and lysyl oxidase expressions. A significant amount of active lysyl oxidase is released in Fn-null hepatic stellate cells in response to TGF-Î²1 through canonical and noncanonical Smad such as PI3 kinase-mediated pathways. TGF-Î²1-induced collagen fibril stiffness in Fn-null hepatic stellate cells is significantly higher compared with wild-type cells. Inhibition of lysyl oxidase significantly reduces collagen fibril stiffness, and treatment of Fn recovers collagen fibril stiffness to wild-type levels. Thus, our findings indicate an indispensable role for Fn in chronic liver fibrosis/cirrhosis in negatively regulating TGF-Î² bioavailability, which in turn modulates ECM remodeling and stiffening and consequently preserves adult organ functions. Furthermore, this regulatory mechanism by Fn could be translated for a potential therapeutic target in a broader variety of chronic fibrotic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2143416311,"Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder are often said to present a global pragmatic impairment. However, there is some observational evidence that context-based comprehension of indirect requests may be preserved in autism. In order to provide experimental confirmation to this hypothesis, indirect speech act comprehension was tested in a group of 15 children with autism between 7 and 12 years and a group of 20 typically developing children between 2:7 and 3:6 years. The aim of the study was to determine whether children with autism can display genuinely contextual understanding of indirect requests. The experiment consisted of a three-pronged semi-structured task involving Mr Potato Head. In the first phase a declarative sentence was uttered by one adult as an instruction to put a garment on a Mr Potato Head toy; in the second the same sentence was uttered as a comment on a picture by another speaker; in the third phase the same sentence was uttered as a comment on a picture by the first speaker. Children with autism complied with the indirect request in the first phase and demonstrated the capacity to inhibit the directive interpretation in phases 2 and 3. TD children had some difficulty in understanding the indirect instruction in phase 1. These results call for a more nuanced view of pragmatic dysfunction in autism."

Cu NPs may presumably be more effective against wood-destroying fungi than bulk or ionic Cu compounds. In particular, Cu- tolerant wood-destroying fungi may not recognize NPs, which may penetrate into fungal cell walls and membranes and exert their impact. The objective of this study was to assess if MC wood preservative formulations have a superior efficacy against Cu-tolerant wood-destroying fungi due to nano effects than conventional Cu biocides. After screening a range of wood-destroying fungi for their resistance to Cu, we investigated fungal growth of the Cu-tolerant fungus Rhodonia placenta in solid and liquid media and on wood treated with MC azole (MCA). In liquid cultures we evaluated the fungal response to ion, nano and bulk Cu distinguishing the ionic and particle effects by means of the Cu2+ chelator ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) and measuring fungal biomass, oxalic acid production and laccase activity of R. placenta. Our results do not support the presence of particular nano effects of MCA against R. placenta that would account for an increased antifungal efficacy, but provide evidence that attribute the main effectiveness of MCA to azoles."
https://openalex.org/W2337785183,"Background Nucleolar and spindle-associated protein 1 (NUSAP1) is an important mitotic regulator. In addition to its crucial function in mitosis, NUSAP1 has recently received attention due to the interesting roles in carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to reveal functional mechanisms of NUSAP1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Methods mRNA and protein expression levels of NUSAP1 in 9 OSCC-derived cells were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting analyses. The correlation between the NUSAP1 expression profile and the clinicopathological factors was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in clinical OSCC samples (n = 70). The NUSAP1 knockdown cells were established with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in OSCC cells, and functional assays were performed using these cells. In addition to the evaluation of cellular proliferation and cell cycle, we also investigated the potential role of NUSAP1 in paclitaxel (PTX)-induced cellular responses. Results mRNA and protein expression of NUSAP1 were significantly up-regulated in OSCC-derived cells compared with human normal oral keratinocytes (P < 0.05). IHC revealed that NUSAP-1 expression is closely associated with primary advanced T stage (P<0.05). Suppression of NUSAP1 expression levels led to significant (P < 0.05) inhibition of cellular proliferation. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by PTX was enhanced in NUSAP1 knockdown OSCC cells. Conclusions NUSAP1 may be a crucial biomarker for OSCC. Moreover, down-regulated NUSAP1 expression suppresses tumor proliferation and also enhances anti-tumor effect of PTX by activating apoptotic pathways. Thus, the present study strongly suggests that regulating NUSAP1 expression should contribute to the therapy for OSCC."

In this study, the role of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor attached to PrPC in prion formation was examined using a cell painting technique. PrPSc formation in two prion-infected neuronal cell lines (ScGT1 and ScN2a cells) and in scrapie-infected primary cortical neurons was increased following the introduction of PrPC. In contrast, PrPC containing a GPI anchor from which the sialic acid had been removed (desialylated PrPC) was not converted to PrPSc. Furthermore, the presence of desialylated PrPC inhibited the production of PrPSc within prion-infected cortical neurons and ScGT1 and ScN2a cells. The membrane rafts surrounding desialylated PrPC contained greater amounts of sialylated gangliosides and cholesterol than membrane rafts surrounding PrPC. Desialylated PrPC was less sensitive to cholesterol depletion than PrPC and was not released from cells by treatment with glimepiride. The presence of desialylated PrPC in neurons caused the dissociation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 from PrP-containing membrane rafts and reduced the activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2.

The prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in man. A key event in these diseases is the conversion of a normal host protein designated PrPC into disease-associated isoforms (PrPSc). In this conversion process, a portion of PrPC that is mostly Î±-helix and random coil becomes refolded into a Î²-pleated sheet in the PrPSc molecule (1Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) indicate that factors that affect the cellular targeting and intracellular trafficking of PrPC are critical in determining PrPSc replication. The majority of PrPC molecules are linked to membranes via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 2The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; cPLA2, cytoplasmic phospholipase A2; PLAP, phospholipase A2-activating peptide; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; HPTLC, high performance thin layer chromatography. anchor (5Stahl N.

GPI anchors play a complex role in the regulation of cell membrane composition, cell signaling and protein trafficking (6Chatterjee S. Mayor S. The GPI-anchor and protein sorting.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1969-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For example, the presence of a GPI anchor targets PrPC to specific membrane microdomains called rafts that are required for efficient PrPSc formation (3Taylor D.R. Hooper N.M. The prion protein and lipid rafts.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 4Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The role of the GPI anchor in prion diseases is controversial because transgenic mice that produce anchorless PrPC produce large amounts of soluble PrPSc (7Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E. Oldstone M. Anchorless prion protein results in infectious amyloid disease without clinical scrapie.Science. 2005; 308: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), suggesting that the GPI anchor was not essential for PrPSc formation. In contrast, observations that neuronal cells producing anchorless PrPC were resistant to scrapie infection (8McNally K.L. Ward A.E. Priola S.A. Cells expressing anchorless prion protein are resistant to scrapie infection.J. Virol. 2009; 83: 4469-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and that monoacylated PrPC was not converted to PrPSc within neuronal cells (9Bate C. Williams A. Monoacylated cellular prion protein modifies cell membranes, inhibits cell signaling and reduces prion formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8752-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) indicate that the GPI is a critical factor in facilitating membrane-associated PrPSc formation. GPI-anchored molecules, including PrPC, are rapidly incorporated into living cells (10Legler D.F. Doucey M.A. Schneider P. Chapatte L. Bender F.C. Bron C.

Williams A. Monoacylated cellular prion protein modifies cell membranes, inhibits cell signaling and reduces prion formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8752-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This technique was used to examine the role of specific GPI structures on PrPC and PrPSc formation. The GPI anchor attached to PrPC is unusual among mammalian GPIs in that it contains sialic acid (12Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Hecker R. Pan K.M. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Glycosylinositol phospholipid anchors of the scrapie and cellular prion proteins contain sialic acid.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5043-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Neuraminidase digestion was used to produce a PrPC with a GPI anchor lacking sialic acid (desialylated PrPC), a modification that could not be achieved by genetic manipulation methods (13Bate C. Williams A. Neurodegeneration induced by the clustering of sialylated glycosylphosphatidylinositols of prion proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 7935-7944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We report three major observations: first, that desialylated PrPC behaves differently from PrPC with regards to its effects on membrane composition and cell signaling; second, that desialylated PrPC is not converted to PrPSc; and third, that desialylated PrPC inhibits the conversion of endogenous PrPC to PrPSc. Prion-infected ScN2a and ScGT1 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 2 mm glutamine and 2% fetal calf serum. To determine the effect of test preparations on PrPSc formation, ScN2a or ScGT1 cells were added to 6-well plates, allowed to adhere overnight, and then cultured in the presence or absence of test PrPC preparations. The cells were grown with daily changes of media (Â± PrPC preparations), and the amounts of PrPSc were evaluated after 7 days. In other experiments, ScGT1 and ScN2a cells were pretreated for 1 h with control medium or desialylated PrPC and then incubated with phospholipase A2-activating peptide (PLAP) (Bachem) for a further 1 h. Cortical neurons were prepared from the brains of mouse embryos (day 15.5) derived from Prnp wild type(+/+) and Prnp knock-out(0/0) mice after mechanical dissociation. Neurons (106) were added to 6-well plates that had been coated with poly-l-lysine and incubated in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum for 2 h. Cultures were shaken (600 rpm for 5 min), and nonadherent cells were removed by two washes in PBS. Neurons were grown in neurobasal medium containing B27 components and 5 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Sigma) for 10 days. Immunostaining showed that the cells were greater than 95% neurofilament-positive. In some experiments, neurons were pretreated for 24 h with squalestatin (GlaxoSmithKline). The fate of PrPC preparations was determined by incubating neurons with 10 ng of PrPC or desialylated PrPC. Cells were washed to remove unbound PrPC and incubated in fresh culture medium for different time periods. For infection studies, neurons from either Prnp(0/0) or Prnp(+/+) mice were pulsed with 1 ng of PrPSc (derived from ScGT1 cells (14Bate C. Tayebi M. Williams A. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor is a major determinant of prion binding and replication.Biochem. J. 2010; 428: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)) and then incubated with 10 ng of PrPC or 10 ng of desialylated PrPC. Media containing PrPC preparations were replaced daily for 10 days, and the amount of PrPSc in neurons was measured by ELISA. All experiments were performed in accordance with European regulations (European Community Council Directive, 1986, 56/609/EEC) and approved by the local authority veterinary service/ethical committee. Treated cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and homogenized in an extraction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.2% SDS at 106 cells/ml, and nuclei and large fragments were removed by centrifugation (1000 Ã g for 5 min). Mixed protease inhibitors (4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, aprotinin, leupeptin, bestatin, pepstatin A, and E-46) (Sigma) and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture including PP1, PP2A, microcystin LR, cantharidin, and p-bromotetramisole (Sigma) were added to some membrane extracts. To determine the amount of PrPSc in cells extracts were digested with 1 Î¼g/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 37 Â°C, heated to 95 Â°C for 5 min, and tested in a PrP ELISA as described (9Bate C. Williams A. Monoacylated cellular prion protein modifies cell membranes, inhibits cell signaling and reduces prion formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8752-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The cells were homogenized in an ice-cold buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and mixed protease inhibitors (106 cells/ml), and nuclei and large fragments were removed by centrifugation (1000 Ã g for 5 min). The supernatant was incubated on ice for 60 min prior to further centrifugation (16,000 Ã g for 30 min at 4 Â°C). The detergent-soluble material was reserved as the normal cell membrane. The insoluble DRMs were homogenized in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.2% SDS and mixed protease inhibitors. After further centrifugation (10 min at 16,000 Ã g), the supernatant was collected as the raft fraction. Cells were harvested with a Teflon scraper and homogenized in a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 1 mm EDTA, mixed protease inhibitors, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Nuclei and cell fragments were removed by centrifugation (1000 Ã g for 5 min). Membranes were washed by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã g for 20 min at 4 Â°C and solubilized in an ice-cold buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm EDTA. 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40% sucrose solutions were prepared and layered to produce a gradient at 4 Â°C. Solubilized membranes were layered on top and centrifuged at 50,000 Ã g for 18 h at 4 Â°C. Serial 0.8- or 0.25-ml volumes were collected from the bottom of gradients. PrPC molecules were isolated from murine GT1 neuronal cell membranes using a combination of immunoaffinity columns, size exclusion chromatography (Superdex), and reverse phase chromatography on C18 columns (Waters) as described (9Bate C. Williams A. Monoacylated cellular prion protein modifies cell membranes, inhibits cell signaling and reduces prion formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8752-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PrPC was digested with 2 units/ml endoglycosidase F (Sigma) and/or 0.2 units/ml neuraminidase (Clostridium perfringens; Sigma) for 2 h at 37 Â°C. TFA was added (final concentration, 0.1%), and digested PrPC was loaded onto C18 columns. The samples were eluted under a gradient of acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% TFA. 1-ml samples were collected, split into two, and lyophilized. One sample was solubilized in an extraction buffer (as above) and tested in a PrP ELISA. PrP-containing fractions were solubilized in culture medium by sonication prior to use. PrPSc preparations consisted of supernatants collected from ScGT1 cells that were centrifuged (500 Ã g for 5 min) to remove cell debris and concentrated using a 10-kDa filter (Sartorius Vivaspin). Preparations were digested with 1 Î¼g/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 37 Â°C to remove PrPC, and the remaining protease-resistant PrP was measured by ELISA (see below). The samples were frozen at â20 Â°C for storage. On the day of use, PrPSc preparations were diluted to 1 ng/ml in culture medium and sonicated before addition to cells. Maxisorb immunoplates (Nunc) were coated with mAb ICSM18 and blocked with 5% milk powder. Samples were applied and detected with biotinylated mAb ICSM35, followed by extravidin-alkaline phosphatase and 1 mg/ml 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). Absorbance was measured on a microplate reader at 405 nm, and the amount of PrP in samples was calculated by reference to serial dilutions of recombinant murine PrP (Prionics). Maxisorb immunoplates were coated with 0.5 Î¼g/ml of mouse mAb anti-cPLA2, clone CH-7 (Upstate), and blocked. Samples were incubated for 1 h, and the amount of cPLA2 was detected using a goat polyclonal anti-cPLA2 (Santa Cruz Biotech) followed by biotinylated anti-goat IgG, extravidin-alkaline phosphatase, and 1 mg/ml 4-nitrophenyl phosphate. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm, and the amount of cPLA2 protein is expressed in units: 100 units = amount of cPLA2 in extracts or immunoprecipitates from 106 untreated cells. The activation of cPLA2 is accompanied by phosphorylation of the 505 serine residue, which creates a unique epitope that was measured in an ELISA using an anti-cPLA2 mAb (clone CH-7) combined with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-cPLA2 (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Dako), extravidin-alkaline phosphatase, and 1 mg/ml 4-nitrophenyl phosphate). Absorbance was measured on a microplate reader at 405 nm. The results were expressed as âunits activated cPLA2â with 100 units defined as the amount of activated cPLA2 in extracts derived from 106 untreated cells. GPIs were isolated and analyzed as described (13Bate C. Williams A. Neurodegeneration induced by the clustering of sialylated glycosylphosphatidylinositols of prion proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 7935-7944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, PrPC preparations were digested with proteinase K (100 Î¼g/ml) overnight at 37 Â°C. Digested products were mixed with water-saturated butanol. The butanol phase was collected and washed with water a further three times before being loaded onto C18 columns. GPIs were eluted from C18 columns under a gradient of propanol and water. The presence of phosphatidylinositol in GPIs was determined using mAb (5AB3-11), and specific glycans were detected with biotinylated lectins. Isolated GPIs bound to nitrocellulose membranes by dot blot and were blocked with 5% milk powder. Samples were probed with mAb 5AB3-11, biotinylated Sambucus nigra lectin (detects terminal sialic acid residues bound Î±-2,6 or Î±-2,3 to galactose), biotinylated concanavalin A (detects mannose), or biotinylated Ricinus communis agglutinin I (detects terminal galactose) (Vector Laboratories). Bound lectins were visualized using extravidin peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence. The mAb was visualized by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-murine IgM and chemiluminescence. In other studies, GPIs were separated on silica gel 60 high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) plates in a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water (10/10/3 v/v/v) and detected by mAb 5AB3-11. The concentrations of GPIs were measured by ELISA. Maxisorb immunoplates were coated with 0.5 Î¼g/ml concanavalin A (binds mannose) and blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS-Tween. Samples were added, and any bound GPI was detected by the addition of mAb 5AB3-11 (15Bate C.A. Kwiatkowski D. A monoclonal antibody that recognizes phosphatidylinositol inhibits induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha by different strains of Plasmodium falciparum.Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by a biotinylated anti-mouse IgM (Sigma), extravidin-alkaline phosphatase and 1 mg/ml 4-nitrophenyl phosphate. Absorbance was measured on a microplate reader at 405 nm. Treated cells were homogenized in ice cold 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA at 106 cells/ml. Cell debris was removed from by centrifugation (1000 Ã g for 5 min), and the supernatant was incubated with a mAb to PrP (4F2) for 30 min at 4 Â°C on rollers. Magnetic microbeads containing protein G (Miltenyi Biotech) were added (10 Î¼l/ml) for 30 min, and protein G-bound antibody complexes were isolated using a Î¼MACS magnetic system (Miltenyi Biotech) at 4 Â°C. The amounts of sialylated gangliosides in precipitates were determined by diluting precipitates from 106 cells in 1 ml of carbonate buffer and plating in Maxisorb immunoplates overnight. The plates were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS-Tween, and sialylated gangliosides were detected by the addition of biotinylated S. nigra lectin followed by extravidin-alkaline phosphatase and 1 mg/ml 4-nitrophenyl phosphate. Absorbance was measured on a microplate reader at 405 nm. Gangliosides within immunoprecipitates were separated by HPTLC in a solvent containing chloroform/methanol/water (6/4/1 v/v/v). Plates were blocked, and sialic acid containing gangliosides were detected by incubation with biotinylated S. nigra lectin, extravidin-peroxidase, and chemiluminesence. Samples were dissolved in 50 Î¼l of Laemmli buffer, boiled, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-P PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by semidry blotting. Membranes were blocked using 10% milk powder in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. PrP was detected by incubation with mAb ICSM18, Î²-actin by mAb AC-74 (Sigma), and cPLA2 with mAb CH-7, followed by a secondary anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase. Bound antibody was visualized by chemiluminescence. Cholesterol and protein content were determined in cell membrane extracts. Protein concentrations were measured using a micro-BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The concentrations of cholesterol were measured using the Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit (Invitrogen). Cholesterol is oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to yield hydrogen peroxide, which reacts with 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red reagent) to produce highly fluorescent resorufin. Fluorescence was measured by excitation at 550 nm and emission detection at 590 nm. The concentration of cholesterol was calculated by reference to cholesterol standards. Comparison of treatment effects was carried out using Student's paired t-tests, one-way and two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post hoc tests (IBM SPSS statistics 20). Error values are S.D., and significance was determined, where p < 0.01. Correlations between data sets were analyzed using Pearson's bivariate coefficient (IBM SPSS statistics 20). Initial studies were performed to determine whether the N-linked glycans that are attached to PrPC affect PrPSc formation in ScGT1 cells. N-Linked glycans were removed from PrPC by digestion with endoglycosidase F (16Haraguchi T. Fisher S. Olofsson S. Endo T. Groth D. Tarentino A. Borchelt D.R. Teplow D. Hood L. Burlingame A. Asparagine-linked glycosylation of the scrapie and cellular prion proteins.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), and deglycosylated PrPC was isolated on C18 columns (Fig. 1B). The addition of PrPC or endoglycosidase F-digested PrPC (deglycosylated PrPC) increased the PrPSc content of ScGT1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C); there were no significant differences in the amounts of PrPSc in cells incubated with PrPC or with deglycosylated PrPC. Similarly, the addition of 10 ng deglycosylated PrPC increased the amount of PrPSc in ScN2a cells (4.7 ng PrPSc/106 cells Â± 1.1 compared with 1.5 ng PrPSc Â± 0.7, n = 15, p < 0.05). Because the absence of N-linked glycans did not significantly affect PrPSc formation in these cells, all the following experiments were performed with deglycosylated PrPC preparations. The GPI anchor attached to PrPC is unusual for mammalian GPIs in that it contains sialic acid as first described by Stahl et al. (12Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Hecker R. Pan K.M. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Glycosylinositol phospholipid anchors of the scrapie and cellular prion proteins contain sialic acid.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5043-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and illustrated in Fig. 2A. To confirm the presence of sialic acid in our PrPC preparations, GPIs were isolated from PrPC and desialylated PrPC (neuraminidase-digested) by reverse phase chromatography (Fig. 2B). GPIs derived from PrPC and desialylated PrPC eluted at different concentrations of propanol. HPTLC analysis confirmed that neuraminidase digestion altered the migration of the GPI isolated from PrPC consistent with the loss of sialic acid (Fig. 2C). Isolated GPIs were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with mAb 5AB3-11 and biotinylated lectins. The digestion of PrPC with neuraminidase did not affect the binding of mAb 5AB3-11 (binds to phosphatidylinositol) or concanavalin A (binds to mannose) to the GPIs, showing that similar amounts of GPIs were added to blots. S. nigra lectin (which reacts with terminal sialic acid bound either Î±-2,6 or Î±-2,3 to galactose) bound to GPIs isolated from PrPC, but not to GPIs derived from neuraminidase-digested PrPC, indicating that sialic acid had been removed (Fig. 2D). The lectin R. communis agglutinin I bound to neuraminidase-digested GPIs, indicating that terminal galactose had been exposed. The observation that PrPSc does not replicate in Prnp(0/0) neurons (14Bate C. Tayebi M. Williams A. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor is a major determinant of prion binding and replication.Biochem. J. 2010; 428: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) allowed us to examine whether desialylated PrPC was converted to PrPSc. Both PrPC and desialylated PrPC bound readily to recipient Prnp(0/0) neurons; following the addition of 10-ng PrPC preparations for 2 h, there was no significant difference in the amounts of PrPC and desialylated PrPC bound (9.4 ng of PrPC Â± 0.9 compared with 9.7 ng Â± 0.9, n = 9, p = 0.7). Neurons from Prnp(0/0) mice were pulsed with 1 ng of PrPSc for 2 h and incubated with culture media containing control medium, 10 ng of PrPC, or 10 ng of desialylated PrPC. Media containing the PrPC/desialylated PrPC was replaced daily for 10 days when the amounts of PrPSc in neurons were measured. We did not detect any PrPSc in neurons that had been pulsed with 1 ng of PrPSc and incubated with control medium, suggesting that original inoculum was degraded by these neurons. However, PrPSc pulsed neurons incubated daily with 10 ng PrPC contained 25.7 ng of PrPSc Â± 4.2, n = 12, indicating that some of the added PrPC was converted to PrPSc. In contrast, no PrPSc was detected in neurons pulsed with 1 ng of PrPSc and incubated daily with 10 ng of desialylated PrPC, indicating that it was not converted to PrPSc (Fig. 3A). Immunoblots confirmed the ELISA data and showed that PrPSc was formed in Prnp(0/0) neurons pulsed with PrPSc and incubated daily with PrPC but not in neurons pulsed with PrPSc and incubated daily with control medium or with desialylated PrPC (Fig. 3B). Next, the effects of desialylated PrPC on the conversion of endogenous PrPC to PrPSc were determined. For this study, neurons derived from Prnp(+/+) mice were pulsed with 1 ng of PrPSc for 2 h and incubated for a further 10 days with 10 ng of PrPC or 10 ng of desialylated PrPC. Neurons pulsed with PrPSc and incubated in control medium contained 40.2 ng of PrPSc Â± 5.2, n = 12. The addition of PrPC increased the amount of PrPSc in neurons to 68.5 ng of PrPSc Â± 7.1, n = 12, whereas the addition of desialylated PrPC reduced the amount of PrPSc to 5.2 ng/ml (Fig. 4, A and B), indicating that desialylated PrPC suppressed the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. Furthermore, when neurons from Prnp(0/0) mice were pulsed with 1 ng of PrPSc and incubated with 10 ng of PrPC or a mixture of 10 ng of PrPC and 10 ng of desialylated PrPC for 10 days the presence of desialylated PrPC reduced PrPSc production (Fig. 4C). Similarly, the daily addition of desialylated PrPC reduced the PrPSc content of recipient ScN2a cells (Fig. 4D) and ScGT1 cells (Fig. 4E). To determine the mechanism(s) involved in desialylated PrPC-induced suppression of PrPSc formation, its properties in noninfected cells were examined. Both PrPC and desialylated PrPC bound readily to recipient Prnp(0/0) neurons. The targeting of PrPC to DRMs is necessary for efficient prion formation (4Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. Cholesterol depletion and modification of COOH-terminal targeting sequence of the prion protein inhibit formation of the scrapie isoform.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), and following the addition of 10-ng PrPC preparations, similar amounts of PrPC and desialylated PrPC were found within DRMs (8.2 ng of PrPC Â± 0.9 compared with 8.1 ng of desialylated PrPC Â± 1.2, n = 9, p = 0.7). PrPC and desialylated PrPC were found within different membrane rafts; after Prnp(0/0) neurons pulsed with 10 ng of PrPC or 10 ng of desialylated PrPC were homogenized in ice-cold Triton X-100 (which maintains the integrity of membrane rafts) and subjected to sucrose density gradient analysis; the desialylated PrPC was found in lower density rafts than those containing PrPC (Fig. 5A). These rafts were examined in detail after immunoprecipitation. Similar amounts of PrPC and desialylated PrPC were obtained in each precipitate (Fig. 5B). However, the rafts isolated with PrPC contained significantly less cholesterol than rafts surrounding desialylated PrPC (Fig. 5C). HPTLC analysis of immunoprecipitates demonstrated that rafts containing desialylated PrPC contained more sialylated gangliosides than did membranes surrounding PrPC (Fig. 5D). ELISA studies confirmed that rafts co-precipitated with desialylated PrPC contained significantly more sialylated gangliosides than rafts co-precipitated with PrPC (Fig. 5E). Reducing cellular cholesterol concentrations destabilized some rafts, result"
https://openalex.org/W2105696926,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides non-invasive, repetitive measures in the same individual, allowing the study of a physio-pathological event over time. In this study, we tested the performance of 7 Tesla multi-parametric MRI to monitor the dynamic changes of mouse skeletal muscle injury and regeneration upon acute ischemia induced by femoral artery dissection. T2-mapping (T2 relaxation time), diffusion-tensor imaging (Fractional Anisotropy) and perfusion by Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (K-trans) were measured and imaging results were correlated with histological morphometric analysis in both Gastrocnemius and Tibialis anterior muscles. We found that tissue damage positively correlated with T2-relaxation time, while myofiber regeneration and capillary density positively correlated with Fractional Anisotropy. Interestingly, K-trans positively correlated with capillary density. Accordingly, repeated MRI measurements between day 1 and day 28 after surgery in ischemic muscles showed that: 1) T2-relaxation time rapidly increased upon ischemia and then gradually declined, returning almost to basal level in the last phases of the regeneration process; 2) Fractional Anisotropy dropped upon ischemic damage induction and then recovered along with muscle regeneration and neoangiogenesis; 3) K-trans reached a minimum upon ischemia, then progressively recovered. Overall, Gastrocnemius and Tibialis anterior muscles displayed similar patterns of MRI parameters dynamic, with more marked responses and less variability in Tibialis anterior. We conclude that MRI provides quantitative information about both tissue damage after ischemia and the subsequent vascular and muscle regeneration, accounting for the differences between subjects and, within the same individual, between different muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2199872543,"Background Structured Professional Judgement (SPJ) is routinely administered in mental health and criminal justice settings but cannot identify violence risk above moderate accuracy. There is no current evidence that violence can be prevented using SPJ. This may be explained by routine application of predictive instead of causal statistical models when standardising SPJ instruments. Methods We carried out a prospective cohort study of 409 male and female patients discharged from medium secure services in England and Wales to the community. Measures were taken at baseline (pre-discharge), 6 and 12 months post-discharge using the Historical, Clinical and Risk-20 items version 3 (HCR-20v3) and Structural Assessment of Protective Factors (SAPROF). Information on violence was obtained via the McArthur community violence instrument and the Police National Computer. Results In a lagged model, HCR-20v3 and SAPROF items were poor predictors of violence. Eight items of the HCR-20v3 and 4 SAPROF items did not predict violent behaviour better than chance. In re-analyses considering temporal proximity of risk/ protective factors (exposure) on violence (outcome), risk was elevated due to violent ideation (OR 6.98, 95% CI 13.85â12.65, P<0.001), instability (OR 5.41, 95% CI 3.44â8.50, P<0.001), and poor coping/ stress (OR 8.35, 95% CI 4.21â16.57, P<0.001). All 3 risk factors were explanatory variables which drove the association with violent outcome. Self-control (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.08â0.24, P<0.001) conveyed protective effects and explained the association of other protective factors with violence. Conclusions Using two standardised SPJ instruments, predictive (lagged) methods could not identify risk and protective factors which must be targeted in interventions for discharged patients with severe mental illness. Predictive methods should be abandoned if the aim is to progress from risk assessment to effective risk management and replaced by methods which identify factors causally associated with violence."

LRH-1 plays an important role in controlling lipid and cholesterol homeostasis and is a potential target for the treatment of metabolic and neoplastic diseases. Although the prospect of modulating LRH-1 via small molecules is exciting, the molecular mechanism linking PL structure to transcriptional co-regulator preference is unknown. Previous studies showed that binding to an activating PL ligand, such as dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, favors LRH-1's interaction with transcriptional co-activators to up-regulate gene expression. Both crystallographic and solution-based structural studies showed that dilauroylphosphatidylcholine binding drives unanticipated structural fluctuations outside of the canonical activation surface in an alternate activation function (AF) region, encompassing the Î²-sheet-H6 region of the protein. However, the mechanism by which dynamics in the alternate AF influences co-regulator selectivity remains elusive. Here, we pair x-ray crystallography with molecular modeling to identify an unexpected allosteric network that traverses the protein ligand binding pocket and links these two elements to dictate selectivity. We show that communication between the alternate AF region and classical AF2 is correlated with the strength of the co-regulator interaction. This work offers the first glimpse into the conformational dynamics that drive this unusual PL-mediated nuclear hormone receptor activation.

Binging D. Targeting nuclear receptors to treat type 2 diabetes.Endocr. J. 2010; 57: 75Google Scholar). Although the endogenous ligand for hLRH-1 is currently unknown, oral treatment with the exogenous PL agonist dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (PC 12:0â12:0; DLPC) lowers serum lipid levels, reduces liver fat accumulation, and improves glucose tolerance in an LRH-1-dependent manner in a diabetic mouse model (13Lee J.M. Lee Y.K. Mamrosh J.L. Busby S.A. Griffin P.R. Pathak M.C. Ortlund E.A. Moore D.D. A nuclear-receptor-dependent phosphatidylcholine pathway with antidiabetic effects.Nature. 2011; 474: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Activation of LRH-1 by DLPC drives increased glucose uptake by muscle and increases the rate of both glycolysis and glycogen synthesis with a concomitant reduction in fatty acid metabolism (14Bolado-Carrancio A. Riancho J.A. Sainz J. RodrÃ­guez-Rey J.C. Activation of nuclear receptor NR5A2 increases Glut4 expression and glucose metabolism in muscle cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

New evidence suggests that LRH-1 may also be targeted to relieve chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress. Activation of LRH-1 by synthetic DLPC or the small molecule RJW100 induces Plk3, which is required for the activation of ATF2 and the induction of its target genes, which play a key role in resolving ER stress (15Mamrosh J.L.

Given its potential therapeutic value, LRH-1 has been the subject of multiple attempts to identify small molecule modulators (16Whitby R.J. Dixon S. Maloney P.R. Delerive P. Goodwin B.J. Parks D.J.

These attempts have been met with mixed success due in part to our limited understanding of LRH-1's mechanism of activation. We have shown that DLPC is able to bind directly to the LRH-1 ligand binding domain (LBD) and activate the receptor by affecting receptor dynamics in an alternate activation function (AF) region, encompassing the Î²-sheet-H6 region of the protein, to alter co-regulator binding preference (20Musille P.M.

Biol. 2012; 19: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Importantly, it seems that DLPC may promote activation by relieving LRH-1 from repression by the non-canonical co-repressor NR SHP, which mimics a co-activator using the canonical Leu-Xaa-Xaa-Leu-Leu (where Xaa is any amino acid) nuclear co-activator interaction motif (21Goodwin B.

In the absence of ligand, the alternate AF is highly dynamic and mutations that restrict motion in this region ablate transactivation (20Musille P.M. Pathak M.C. Lauer J.L. Hudson W.H. Griffin P.R.

SHP is a robust co-repressor of LRH-1-mediated transactivation in the liver and can recognize both apo-LRH-1 and LRH-1 when bound to a non-ideal ligand such as bacterial PLs in vitro (21Goodwin B.

It is unclear how LRH-1 discriminates between SHP and co-activators such as TIF2 that bind using a similar LXXLL motif to recognize the active NR orientation. Furthermore, how does human LRH-1 recognize co-activators in the absence of ligand? How do PLs varying only in their acyl tail composition show differing abilities to drive transactivation? Which ligand/co-regulator states are appropriate for in silico ligand design? This incomplete understanding of what dictates LRH-1's PL and co-regulator selectivity limits our ability to guide the design of robust small molecule modulators for this intriguing pharmacological target. To address these questions, we have generated a novel crystal structure of the LRH-1Â·TIF2 complex in an apo-state, as well as a higher resolution structure of LRH-1 bound to Escherichia coli PLs. These crystal structures, in combination with novel lipid binding assays, molecular dynamics simulations, and principal component analysis (PCA) have allowed us to identify an unexpected allosteric network that may contribute to PL-mediated NR signaling and co-regulator selectivity.

Both the apo-LRH-1 LBDÂ·TIF2 complex and the LRH-1 LBDÂ·E. coli PLÂ·TIF2 complex crystals were generated by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 20 Â°C from solutions containing 1 Î¼l of protein at 6.5 mg mlâ1 in complex with a peptide-derived human TIF2 NR box 3 (+H3N-KENALLRYLLDKDD-CO2â) at a 1:4 molar ratio and 1 Î¼l of the following crystal mixture: 0.7â1 m di-sodium malonate, 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5% Jeffamine ED-2001.

Open table in a new tab ProSMART is an alignment tool that provides a conformation-independent structural comparison of two proteins based upon the alignment of corresponding overlapping fragments of the protein chains (29Nicholls R.A. Fischer M. McNicholas S. Murshudov G.N. Conformation-independent structural comparison of macromolecules with ProSMART.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2014; 70: 2487-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We performed ProSMART analyses among five LRH-1 structures with different bound ligands and co-regulator peptides, representing different activation states as follows: apo-SHP (fully repressed; PDB code 4DOR); apo-TIF2, E. coli PLÂ·SHP (PDB code 1YUC); E. coli PLâTIF2, and DLPCÂ·TIF2 (fully activated; PDB code 4DOS). This allowed for a detailed analysis of the local structural dissimilarities between two proteins independently of their global conformations. The local backbone conformation of available LRH-1 crystal structures was compared to generate the Procrustes score, which is the r.m.s.d. of the central residue of two corresponding structural fragments of length n, where n is an odd number of amino acids. Dilauroylphosphatidylethanolamine (DLPE; 50 mg, 90 Î¼mol), 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofuran (NBD-Cl; 50 mg, 250 Î¼mol), and triethylamine (17.5 Î¼l) were dissolved in 5 ml of 1:1 CHCl3/MeOH and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was dried, reconstituted in a minimal volume of CHCl3, and purified by TLC on silica in 9:1 CHCl3/MeOH (Rf = 0.36). The product was extracted with CHCl3, filtered, and evaporated to yield 37 mg (50 Î¼mol, 56% yield) of NBD-DLPE. Product identity and purity were verified by mass spectrometry, with a single peak corresponding to NBD-DLPE at m/z 741.38671. To characterize PL binding, we developed an equilibrium-based FRET assay using DCIA-labeled LRH-1 LBD as the donor and NBD-DLPE as the acceptor. Recombinant LRH-1 from E. coli was fluorescently labeled with DCIA (7-diethylamino-3-((4â²-(iodoacetyl)amino)phenyl)-4-methylcoumarin; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), according to manufacturer instructions, and further purified by gel filtration chromatography to remove excess dye. All experiments were performed in assay buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5% glycerol, and 0.1% N-octyl Î²-d-glucopyranoside. All PL stocks were prepared as small unilamellar vesicles via sonication from evaporated chloroform stocks reconstituted in assay buffer. The binding affinity of NBD-DLPE to LRH-1 was measured using a constant concentration of 150 nm unlabeled or DCIA-LRH-1 and 0â100 Î¼m NBD-DLPE. Competition assays were performed with constant concentrations of 150 nm DCIA-LRH-1 and 5 Î¼m NBD-DLPE, with 0â100 Î¼m competing PL. Fluorescence intensity was measured on a Synergy 4 plate reader (Biotek; Winooski, VT) equipped with 380/20 nm excitation and 460/40 nm emission filters. All assays were performed in triplicate on black 384-well plates in a total volume of 50 Î¼l. Data for unlabeled LRH-1 were subtracted from corresponding DCIA-LRH-1 data to remove background fluorescence, and all background-corrected data were expressed as percent fluorescence intensity of fully unbound DCIA-LRH-1 (i.e. 0 m NBD-DLPE). Data were processed with GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Transactivation of wild type and mutant LRH-1 was measured via luciferase-based reporter gene assay. HEK 293T cells were seeded into 24-well plates and incubated at 37 Â°C in complete media (DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) until â¼90% confluent. Each well was then transiently transfected in OptiMEM using Lipofectamine 3000 with plasmids encoding firefly luciferase under control of the shp promoter (SHP-luc; 500 ng/well), Renilla luciferase under constitutive activation via the CMV reporter (pRLCMV; 10 ng/well), and wild type or mutant LRH-1 in the pCI mammalian expression vector (100 ng/well). Transfection was ended after 4 h of incubation at 37 Â°C via the replacement of transfection mixture with complete media, and cells were incubated overnight. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega; Madison, WI). Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA), via one-factor analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test using wild type LRH-1 as a control. Data are the results of five independent experiments. All mutations were introduced into the wild type LRH-1/pCI construct using the QuikChange II Lightning multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Five models were constructed to examine the structural and allosteric impacts of ligand/co-regulator agreement as follows: 1) apo-LRH-1Â·TIF2 NRBox3; 2) LRH-1Â·DLPCÂ·TIF2 NRBox3, 3) LRH-1Â·E. coli PLsÂ·TIF2 NRBox3; 4) apo-LRH-Â·SHP NRBox2; 5) LRH-1Â·E. coli PLsÂ·SHP NRBox2. Agreement is defined here by simultaneous binding of an activating lipid and co-activator or by the binding of a co-repressor in the absence of ligand. In every case, residues 297â540 from the LRH-1 LBD form the core of the complex, with additions of 2â3 residues at either terminus as necessary to maintain consistent sequences between models, using the program Xleap, part of the AmberTools11 suite (30Wang J.

All five systems were solvated with TIP3P water in a rectangular box with equilibrated dimensions of 67 Ã 70 Ã 72 â« and neutralized with sodium and chloride ions to a salt concentration of 0.15 m. Briefly, the first model containing the LRH-1 LBD, in the apo-state, bound to a TIF2 co-activator peptide was modeled directly from the novel apoLRH-1Â·TIF2 NRBox3 crystal structure. The second model, containing DLPC in the binding pocket, bound to a TIF2 co-activator peptide was modeled directly from PDB code 4DOS (20Musille P.M. Pathak M.C. Lauer J.L. Hudson W.H. Griffin P.R.

The third system, comprised of the LRH-1 LBD with the E. coli PL in the binding pocket, bound to a TIF2 peptide was modeled from the novel LRH-1Â·E. coli PLsÂ·TIF2 NRBox3 crystal structure. Although electron density in the crystal structure is insufficient to identify the headgroup of the bound lipid, mass spectrometry results suggest phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine to be the predominant PL isoforms (20Musille P.M.

Thus, we modeled a bacterial phosphatidylethanolamine with 16 and 18 carbons on the sn1 and sn2 position, respectively, derived from the PDB ligand EPH, which is herein referred to as E. coli PL. The fourth model consists of the LRH-1 LBD, in the apo-state, bound to a SHP co-repressor peptide, constructed from the LRH-1 LBD (derived from the apoLRH-1 LBD-TIF2 NRBox3 structure), with the SHP peptide (PDB code 4DOR) (20Musille P.M.

The charge clamp-specific contacts between LRH-1 residues Arg-361 and Glu-534 and the SHP peptide were enforced with harmonic restraints during the equilibration phase of the molecular dynamics simulation and released before the production runs.

All systems were subjected to 10,000 steps of steepest-descent minimization, heated to 300 K under the canonical ensemble for 100 ps. Finally, positional restraints were incrementally released first on the protein side chains, followed by the backbone, under the isobaric-isothermal ensemble.

https://openalex.org/W2250417719,"The study of community attitudes toward welfare and welfare recipients is an area of increasing interest. This is not only because negative attitudes can lead to stigmatization and discrimination, but because of the relevance of social attitudes to policy decisions. We quantify the attitudes toward welfare in the Australian population using attitude data from a nationally representative survey (N = 3243). Although there was broad support for the social welfare system, negative attitudes are held toward those who receive welfare benefits. Using canonical correlation analysis we identify multivariate associations between welfare attitudes and respondent demographic characteristics. A primary attitudinal dimension of welfare positivity was found amongst those with higher levels of education, life instability, and personal exposure to the welfare system. Other patterns of negative welfare attitudes appeared to be motivated by beliefs that the respondent's personal circumstances indicate their deservingness. Moreover, a previously unidentified and unconsidered subset of respondents was identified. This group had positive attitudes toward receiving government benefits despite having no recent experience of welfare. They did, however, possess many of the characteristics that frequently lead to welfare receipt. These results provide insights into not only how attitudinal patterns segment across the population, but are of relevance to policy makers considering how to align welfare reform with community attitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2303298430,"Prediction of human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) binding affinities of small ligands, i.e., substrates and inhibitors, represents an important task for predicting drug-drug interactions. A quantitative assessment of the ligand binding affinity towards different CYPs can provide an estimate of inhibitory activity or an indication of isoforms prone to interact with the substrate of inhibitors. However, the accuracy of global quantitative models for CYP substrate binding or inhibition based on traditional molecular descriptors can be limited, because of the lack of information on the structure and flexibility of the catalytic site of CYPs. Here we describe the application of a method that combines protein-ligand docking, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) theory, to allow for quantitative CYP affinity prediction. Using this combined approach, a LIE model for human CYP 1A2 was developed and evaluated, based on a structurally diverse dataset for which the estimated experimental uncertainty was 3.3 kJ mol-1. For the computed CYP 1A2 binding affinities, the model showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.1 kJ mol-1 and a standard error in prediction (SDEP) in cross-validation of 4.3 kJ mol-1. A novel approach that includes information on both structural ligand description and protein-ligand interaction was developed for estimating the reliability of predictions, and was able to identify compounds from an external test set with a SDEP for the predicted affinities of 4.6 kJ mol-1 (corresponding to 0.8 pKi units)."

We aimed to compare accuracy of the XpertÂ® MTB/RIF assay, an automated nucleic acid amplification test, between induced sputum and gastric lavage samples from young children in a tuberculosis endemic setting.We analyzed standardized diagnostic data from HIV negative children younger than four years of age who were investigated for tuberculosis disease near Cape Town, South Africa [2009-2012]. Two paired, consecutive induced sputa and early morning gastric lavage samples were obtained from children with suspected tuberculosis. Samples underwent Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube [MGIT] culture and Xpert MTB/RIF assay. We compared diagnostic yield across samples using the two-sample test of proportions and McNemar's Ï2 test; and Wilson's score method to calculate sensitivity and specificity.1,020 children were evaluated for tuberculosis during 1,214 admission episodes. Not all children had 4 samples collected. 57 of 4,463[1.3%] and 26 of 4,606[0.6%] samples tested positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis on MGIT culture and Xpert MTB/RIF assay respectively. 27 of 2,198[1.2%] and 40 of 2,183[1.8%] samples tested positive [on either Xpert MTB/RIF assay or MGIT culture] on induced sputum and gastric lavage samples, respectively. 19/1,028[1.8%] and 33/1,017[3.2%] admission episodes yielded a positive MGIT culture or Xpert MTB/RIF assay from induced sputum and gastric lavage, respectively. Sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF assay was 8/30[26.7%; 95% CI: 14.2-44.4] for two induced sputum samples and 7/31[22.6%; 11.4-39.8] [p = 0.711] for two gastric lavage samples. Corresponding specificity was 893/893[100%;99.6-100] and 885/890[99.4%;98.7-99.8] respectively [p = 0.025].Sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF assay was low, compared to MGIT culture, but diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF did not differ sufficiently between induced sputum and gastric lavage to justify selection of one sampling method over the other, in young children with suspected pulmonary TB.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00953927."
https://openalex.org/W2269040512,"The blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) is an important freshwater aquaculture species, but it is sensitive to hypoxia. No transcriptome data related to growth and hypoxia response are available for this species. In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing for the liver and gills of the fast-growth family and slow-growth family derived from âPujiang No.1â F10 blunt snout bream that were under hypoxic stress and normoxia, respectively. The fish were divided into the following 4 groups: fast-growth family under hypoxic stress, FH; slow-growth family under hypoxic stress, SH; fast-growth family under normoxia, FN; and slow-growth family under normoxia, SN. A total of 185 million high-quality reads were obtained from the normalized cDNA of the pooled samples, which were assembled into 465,582 contigs and 237,172 transcripts. A total of 31,338 transcripts from the same locus (unigenes) were annotated and assigned to 104 functional groups, and 23,103 unigenes were classified into seven main categories, including 45 secondary KEGG pathways. A total of 22,255 (71%) known putative unigenes were found to be shared across the genomes of five model fish species and mammals, and a substantial number (9.4%) of potentially novel genes were identified. When 6,639 unigenes were used in the analysis of differential expression (DE) genes, the number of putative DE genes related to growth pathways in FH, SH, SN and FN was 159, 118, 92 and 65 in both the liver and gills, respectively, and the number of DE genes related to hypoxic response was 57, 33, 23 and 21 in FH, FN, SH and SN, respectively. Our results suggest that growth performance of the fast-growth family should be due to complex mutual gene regulatory mechanisms of these putative DE genes between growth and hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2102083390,"Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein. As a VEGF co-receptor, NRP1 significantly enhances VEGFR2 signaling and promotes vascular permeability and migration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of an NRP-1 inhibitor, ATWLPPR peptide, on the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: a Normal group, a Diabetes (DB) ATWLPPR treatment group and a DB saline group. Electroretinography (ERG), fundus fluorescence angiography (FFA) and leukostasis were examined to evaluate the retinal injury induced by diabetes at the end of the fifth week after STZ injection. Occludin expression and extravasation of albumin were measured to determine the extent of vascular injury. The oxidative stress level and the levels of inflammation-associated proteins were also assayed. The results indicated that treatment with ATWLPPR prevents the abnormal condition of ERG (amplitudes of b-wave decreased and implicit time increased) and vascular injury (occludin degradation and increase in extravasated albumin). These effects were associated with a reduction in the oxidase stress level and the expression of VEGF, GFAP, and ICAM-1. We conclude that ATWLPPR, an NRP-1 inhibitor, may reduce the early retinal damage induced by diabetes by preserving vascular integrity and decreasing the oxidative stress level. Blockade of NRP-1 may be a new therapeutic strategy for the early stages of DR."
https://openalex.org/W2177272990,"Earlier antiretroviral treatment initiation prevents new HIV infections. A key problem in HIV prevention and care is the high number of patients diagnosed late, as these undiagnosed patients can continue forward HIV transmission. We modeled the impact on the Dutch men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) HIV epidemic and cost-effectiveness of an existing partner notification process for earlier identification of HIV-infected individuals to reduce HIV transmission.Reduction in new infections and cost-effectiveness ratios were obtained for the use of partner notification to identify 5% of all new diagnoses (Scenario 1) and 20% of all new diagnoses (Scenario 2), versus no partner notification. Costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were assigned to each disease state and calculated over 5 year increments for a 20 year period.Partner notification is predicted to avert 18-69 infections (interquartile range [IQR] 13-24; 51-93) over the course of 5 years countrywide to 221-830 (IQR 140-299; 530-1,127) over 20 years for Scenario 1 and 2 respectively. Partner notification was considered cost-effective in the short term, with increasing cost-effectiveness over time: from â¬41,476 -â¬41, 736 (IQR â¬40,529-â¬42,147; â¬40,791-â¬42,397) to â¬5,773 -â¬5,887 (â¬5,134-â¬7,196; â¬5,411-â¬6,552) per QALY gained over a 5 and 20 year period, respectively.

Some drug candidates are in clinical trials to substitute current therapies, which are facing emerging drug-resistance accompanied with serious side effects. Here, two cinnamic acid bornyl ester derivatives (1 and 2) were assessed for their antileishmanial activity. Good selectivity and antileishmanial activity of bornyl 3-phenylpropanoate (2) in vitro prompted the antileishmanial assessment in vivo. For this purpose, BALB/c mice were infected with Leishmania major promastigotes and treated with three doses of 50 mg/kg/day of compound 2. The treatment prevented the characteristic swelling at the site of infection and correlated with reduced parasite burden. Transmitted light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy of Leishmania major promastigotes revealed that compounds 1 and 2 induce mitochondrial swelling. Subsequent studies on Leishmania major promastigotes showed the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ÎÎ¨m) as a putative mode of action. As the cinnamic acid bornyl ester derivatives 1 and 2 had exhibited antileishmanial activity in vitro, and compound 2 in Leishmania major-infected BALB/c mice in vivo, they can be regarded as possible lead structures for the development of new antileishmanial therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2125722551,"Synchronous tumors can be independent primary tumors or a primary-metastatic (clonal) pair, which may have clinical implications. Mutational profiling of tumor DNA is increasingly common in the clinic. We investigated whether mutational profiling can distinguish independent from clonal tumors in breast and other cancers, using a carefully defined test based on the Clonal Likelihood Score (CLS = 100 x # shared high confidence (HC) mutations/ # total HC mutations).Statistical properties of a formal test using the CLS were investigated. A high CLS is evidence in favor of clonality; the test is implemented as a one-sided binomial test of proportions. Test parameters were empirically determined using 16,422 independent breast tumor pairs and 15 primary-metastatic tumor pairs from 10 cancer types using The Cancer Genome Atlas.We validated performance of the test with its established parameters, using five published data sets comprising 15,758 known independent tumor pairs (maximum CLS = 4.1%, minimum p-value = 0.48) and 283 known tumor clonal pairs (minimum CLS 13%, maximum p-value <0.01), across renal cell, testicular, and colorectal cancer. The CLS test correctly classified all validation samples but one, which it appears may have been incorrectly classified in the published data. As proof-of-concept we then applied the CLS test to two new cases of invasive synchronous bilateral breast cancer at our institution, each with one hormone receptor positive (ER+/PR+/HER2-) lobular and one triple negative ductal carcinoma. High confidence mutations were identified by exome sequencing and results were validated using deep targeted sequencing. The first tumor pair had CLS of 81% (p-value < 10-15), supporting clonality. In the second pair, no common mutations of 184 variants were validated (p-value >0.99), supporting independence. A plausible molecular mechanism for the shift from hormone receptor positive to triple negative was identified in the clonal pair.We have developed the statistical properties of a carefully defined Clonal Likelihood Score test from mutational profiling of tumor DNA. Under identified conditions, the test appears to reliably distinguish between synchronous tumors of clonal and of independent origin in several cancer types. This approach may have scientific and clinical utility."
https://openalex.org/W2243347490,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs of ~22 nucleotides in length that regulate gene expression by interfering with the stability and translation of mRNAs. Their expression is regulated during development, under a wide variety of stress conditions and in several pathological processes. In nature, animals often face feast or famine conditions. We observed that subjecting early L4 larvae from Caenorhabditis elegans to a 12-hr starvation period produced worms that are thinner and shorter than well-fed animals, with a decreased lipid accumulation, diminished progeny, reduced gonad size, and an increased lifespan. Our objective was to identify which of the 302 known miRNAs of C. elegans changed their expression under starvation conditions as compared to well-fed worms by means of deep sequencing in early L4 larvae. Our results indicate that 13 miRNAs (miR-34-3p, the family of miR-35-3p to miR-41-3p, miR-39-5p, miR-41-5p, miR-240-5p, miR-246-3p and miR-4813-5p) were upregulated, while 2 miRNAs (let-7-3p and miR-85-5p) were downregulated in 12-hr starved vs. well-fed early L4 larvae. Some of the predicted targets of the miRNAs that changed their expression in starvation conditions are involved in metabolic or developmental process. In particular, miRNAs of the miR-35 family were upregulated 6â20 fold upon starvation. Additionally, we showed that the expression of gld-1, important in oogenesis, a validated target of miR-35-3p, was downregulated when the expression of miR-35-3p was upregulated. The expression of another reported target, the cell cycle regulator lin-23, was unchanged during starvation. This study represents a starting point for a more comprehensive understanding of the role of miRNAs during starvation in C. elegans."

https://openalex.org/W2146429656,"Objective We aimed to describe the heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of acute mountain sickness (AMS) and to identify its primary risk factors. Methods The participants (n = 163) received case report form questionnaires, and their heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), echocardiographic and transcranial Doppler variables, ability to perform mental and physical work, mood and psychological factors were assessed within 18 to 22 hours after arriving at 3700 m from sea level (500 m) by plane. First, we examined the differences in all variables between the AMS-positive and the AMS-negative groups. Second, an adjusted regression analysis was performed after correlation and principal component analyses. Results The AMS patients had a higher diastolic vertebral artery velocity (Vd; p = 0.018), a higher HR (p = 0.006) and a lower SpO2. The AMS subjects also experienced poorer sleep quality, as quantified using the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Moreover, the AMS population exhibited more negative mood states, including anxiety, depression, hostility, fatigue and confusion. Five principal components focused on diverse aspects were also found to be significant. Additionally, more advanced age (p = 0.007), a higher HR (p = 0.034), a higher Vd (p = 0.014), a higher AIS score (p = 0.030), a decreased pursuit aiming capacity (p = 0.035) and decreased vigor (p = 0.015) were risk factors for AMS. Conclusions Mood states play critical roles in the development of AMS. Furthermore, an elevated HR and Vd, advanced age, elevated AIS sores, insufficient vigor and decreased mental work capacity are independent risk factors for AMS."

Epidemiological studies on Asian and South American populations have linked arsenic exposure with an increased incidence of lung disease, including pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, both of which are associated with bacterial infection. However, little is known about the effects of low dose arsenic exposure, or the contributions of organic arsenic to the innate immune response to bacterial infection. This study examined the effects on Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) induced cytokine secretion by human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) by inorganic sodium arsenite (iAsIII) and two major metabolites, monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMAV), at concentrations relevant to the U.S. population. Neither iAsIII nor DMAV altered P. aeruginosa induced cytokine secretion. By contrast, MMAIII increased P. aeruginosa induced secretion of IL-8, IL-6 and CXCL2. A combination of iAsIII, MMAIII and DMAV (10 pbb total) reduced IL-8 and CXCL1 secretion. These data demonstrate for the first time that exposure to MMAIII alone, and a combination of iAsIII, MMAIII and DMAV at levels relevant to the U.S. may have negative effects on the innate immune response of human bronchial epithelial cells to P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2269371333,"A central issue in the field of community genetics is the expectation that trait variation among genotypes play a defining role in structuring associated species and in forming community phenotypes. Quantifying the existence of such community phenotypes in two common garden environments also has important consequences for our understanding of gene-by-environment interactions at the community level. The existence of community phenotypes has not been evaluated in the crowns of boreal forest trees. In this study we address the influence of tree genetics on needle chemistry and genetic x environment interactions on two gall-inducing adelgid aphids (Adelges spp. and Sacchiphantes spp.) that share the same elongating bud/shoot niche. We examine the hypothesis that the canopies of different genotypes of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) support different community phenotypes. Three patterns emerged. First, the two gallers show clear differences in their response to host genetics and environment. Whereas genetics significantly affected the abundance of Adelges spp. galls, Sacchiphantes spp. was predominately affected by the environment suggesting that the genetic influence is stronger in Adelges spp. Second, the among family variation in genetically controlled resistance was large, i.e. fullsib families differed as much as 10 fold in susceptibility towards Adelges spp. (0.57 to 6.2 galls/branch). Also, the distribution of chemical profiles was continuous, showing both overlap as well as examples of significant differences among fullsib families. Third, despite the predicted effects of host chemistry on galls, principal component analyses using 31 different phenolic substances showed only limited association with galls and a similarity test showed that trees with similar phenolic chemical characteristics, did not host more similar communities of gallers. Nonetheless, the large genetic variation in trait expression and clear differences in how community members respond to host genetics supports our hypothesis that the canopies of Norway spruce differ in their community phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2134071133,"The execution of reach-to-grasp movements in order to interact with our environment is an important subset of the human movement repertoire. To coordinate such goal-directed movements, information about the relative spatial position of target and effector (in this case the hand) has to be continuously integrated and processed. Recently, we reported the existence of spatial representations in spiking-activity of the cortical fronto-parietal grasp network (Lehmann & Scherberger 2013), and in particular in the anterior intraparietal cortex (AIP). To further investigate the nature of these spatial representations, we explored in two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) how different frequency bands of the local field potential (LFP) in AIP are modulated by grip type, target position, and gaze position, during the planning and execution of reach-to-grasp movements. We systematically varied grasp type, spatial target, and gaze position and found that both spatial and grasp information were encoded in a variety of frequency bands (1-13Hz, 13-30Hz, 30-60Hz, and 60-100Hz, respectively). Whereas the representation of grasp type strongly increased towards and during movement execution, spatial information was represented throughout the task. Both spatial and grasp type representations could be readily decoded from all frequency bands. The fact that grasp type and spatial (reach) information was found not only in spiking activity, but also in various LFP frequency bands of AIP, might significantly contribute to the development of LFP-based neural interfaces for the control of upper limb prostheses."

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) function in the degradation of extracellular matrix and the activities of MMPs are modulated by their endogenous inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). This study aimed to discuss relationship of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 to spontaneous deep ICH (SDICH) susceptibility and hematoma size.Associations were tested by logistic regression and general linear models (GLM) where appropriate, adjusting with covariables of age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Association analyses were performed first by stratification of genders and then by the age of 65 years old (y/o). Elder population was defined as subjects who were older than 65 y/o.There were 396 SDICH patients and 376 control subjects in this study.

Hemorrhage size increased by 9.7 (95% CI 2.1 to 43, P = 0.004) cm3 per minor allele (A) of the rs7503607 variant in the elder female patients and increased by 4.3 (95% CI 1.4 to 12.9, P = 0.009) cm3 per minor allele (A) in all elder patients. In younger patients, the hemorrhage size decreased by 3.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 9.5, P = 0.03) cm3 per minor allele of the s7503726 variant in the female patients.This study showed a significant association between the variants of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 promoters and SDICH susceptibility with significant age and gender differences. Hemorrhage location and size might be affected by TIMP-2 promoter variants in the SDICH patients."
https://openalex.org/W2113936871,"In this paper, stochastic leader gravitational search algorithm (SL-GSA) based on randomized k is proposed. Standard GSA (SGSA) utilizes the best agents without any randomization, thus it is more prone to converge at suboptimal results. Initially, the new approach randomly choses k agents from the set of all agents to improve the global search ability. Gradually, the set of agents is reduced by eliminating the agents with the poorest performances to allow rapid convergence. The performance of the SL-GSA was analyzed for six well-known benchmark functions, and the results are compared with SGSA and some of its variants. Furthermore, the SL-GSA is applied to minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming technique to ensure compatibility with real world optimization problems. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior convergence rate and quality of solution for both real world problems and benchmark functions compared to original algorithm and other recent variants of SGSA."

Similar to Escherichia coli cells, the polar flagellar motor has two states; when the motor is counter-clockwise, the cell swims forward and when the motor is clockwise, the cell swims backward. V. alginolyticus also incorporates a direction randomization step at the start of the forward swimming interval by flicking its flagellum. To gain an understanding on how the polar flagellar motor switch is regulated, distributions of the forward $\Delta_{f}$ and backward $\Delta_{b}$ intervals are investigated herein. We found that the steady-state probability density functions, $P(\Delta_{f})$ and $P(\Delta_{b})$, of freely swimming bacteria are strongly peaked at a finite time, suggesting that the motor switch is not Poissonian. The short-time inhibition is sufficiently strong and long lasting, i.e., several hundred milliseconds for both intervals, which is readily observed and characterized. Treating motor reversal dynamics as a first-passage problem, which results from conformation fluctuations of the motor switch, we calculated $P(\Delta_{f})$ and $P(\Delta_{b})$ and found good agreement with the measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2172133377,"Because of the perpetual development of resistance to current therapies for malaria, the Medicines for Malaria Venture developed the Malaria Box to facilitate the drug development process. We tested the 80 most potent compounds from the box for bilayer-mediated effects on membrane protein conformational changes (a measure of likely toxicity) in a gramicidin-based stopped flow fluorescence assay. Among the Malaria Box compounds tested, four compounds altered membrane properties (p< 0.05); MMV007384 stood out as a potent bilayer-perturbing compound that is toxic in many cell-based assays, suggesting that testing for membrane perturbation could help identify toxic compounds. In any case, MMV007384 should be approached with caution, if at all."
https://openalex.org/W2263958059,"Background 
Pandemic strains of HIV-1 (group M) encode a total of nine structural (gag, pol, env), regulatory (rev, tat) and accessory (vif, vpr, vpu, nef) genes. However, some subtype A and C viruses exhibit an unusual gene arrangement in which the first exon of rev (rev1) and the vpu gene are placed in the same open reading frame. Although this rev1-vpu gene fusion is present in a considerable fraction of HIV-1 strains, its functional significance is unknown.


Results 
Examining infectious molecular clones (IMCs) of HIV-1 that encode the rev1-vpu polymorphism, we show that a fusion protein is expressed in infected cells. Due to the splicing pattern of viral mRNA, however, these same IMCs also express a regular Vpu protein, which is produced at much higher levels. To investigate the function of the fusion gene, we characterized isogenic IMC pairs differing only in their ability to express a Rev1-Vpu protein. Analysis in transfected HEK293T and infected CD4+ T cells showed that all of these viruses were equally active in known Vpu functions, such as down-modulation of CD4 or counteraction of tetherin. Furthermore, the polymorphism did not affect Vpu-mediated inhibition of NF-ÐºB activation or Rev-dependent nuclear export of incompletely spliced viral mRNAs. There was also no evidence for enhanced replication of Rev1-Vpu expressing viruses in primary PBMCs or ex vivo infected human lymphoid tissues. Finally, the frequency of HIV-1 quasispecies members that encoded a rev1-vpu fusion gene did not change in HIV-1 infected individuals over time.


Conclusions 
Expression of a rev1-vpu fusion gene does not affect regular Rev and Vpu functions or alter HIV-1 replication in primary target cells. Since there is no evidence for increased replication fitness of rev1-vpu encoding viruses, this polymorphism likely emerged in the context of other mutations within and/or outside the rev1-vpu intergenic region, and may have a neutral phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2224960014,"The visual cortex analyzes motion information along hierarchically arranged visual areas that interact through bidirectional interconnections. This work suggests a bio-inspired visual model focusing on the interactions of the cortical areas in which a new mechanism of feedforward and feedback processing are introduced. The model uses a neuromorphic vision sensor (silicon retina) that simulates the spike-generation functionality of the biological retina. Our model takes into account two main model visual areas, namely V1 and MT, with different feature selectivities. The initial motion is estimated in model area V1 using spatiotemporal filters to locally detect the direction of motion. Here, we adapt the filtering scheme originally suggested by Adelson and Bergen to make it consistent with the spike representation of the DVS. The responses of area V1 are weighted and pooled by area MT cells which are selective to different velocities, i.e. direction and speed. Such feature selectivity is here derived from compositions of activities in the spatio-temporal domain and integrating over larger space-time regions (receptive fields). In order to account for the bidirectional coupling of cortical areas we match properties of the feature selectivity in both areas for feedback processing. For such linkage we integrate the responses over different speeds along a particular preferred direction. Normalization of activities is carried out over the spatial as well as the feature domains to balance the activities of individual neurons in model areas V1 and MT. Our model was tested using different stimuli that moved in different directions. The results reveal that the error margin between the estimated motion and synthetic ground truth is decreased in area MT comparing with the initial estimation of area V1. In addition, the modulated V1 cell activations shows an enhancement of the initial motion estimation that is steered by feedback signals from MT cells."
