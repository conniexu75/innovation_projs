https://openalex.org/W2107898791,"The Zeeman effect, which is usually detrimental to superconductivity, can be strongly protective when an effective Zeeman field from intrinsic spin-orbit coupling locks the spins of Cooper pairs in a direction orthogonal to an external magnetic field. We performed magnetotransport experiments with ionic-gated molybdenum disulfide transistors, in which gating prepared individual superconducting states with different carrier dopings, and measured an in-plane critical field B(c2) far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit, consistent with Zeeman-protected superconductivity. The gating-enhanced B(c2) is more than an order of magnitude larger than it is in the bulk superconducting phases, where the effective Zeeman field is weakened by interlayer coupling. Our study provides experimental evidence of an Ising superconductor, in which spins of the pairing electrons are strongly pinned by an effective Zeeman field."

Spadoni et al. describe a “gut-vascular barrier” that prevents intestinal microbes from accessing the liver and the bloodstream in mice (see the Perspective by Bouziat and Jabri). Studies with human samples and in mice revealed that the cell biology of the gut-vascular barrier shares similarities with the blood-brain barrier of the central nervous system. Pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella typhimurium could penetrate the gut-vascular barrier in mice, gaining access to the liver and bloodstream, in a manner dependent on the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2–type III secretion system.

Cas9-guide RNA complexes recognize and cleave double-stranded DNA sequences on the basis of 20-nucleotide RNA-DNA complementarity, but the mechanism of target searching in mammalian cells is unknown. Here, we use single-particle tracking to visualize diffusion and chromatin binding of Cas9 in living cells. We show that three-dimensional diffusion dominates Cas9 searching in vivo, and off-target binding events are, on average, short-lived (<1 second). Searching is dependent on the local chromatin environment, with less sampling and slower movement within heterochromatin. These results reveal how the bacterial Cas9 protein interrogates mammalian genomes and navigates eukaryotic chromatin structure."

Lavas erupting on Baffin Island, Canada, tap a part of Earth's mantle isolated from convective mixing. Hallis et al. studied hydrogen isotopes in the lavas that help to “fingerprint” the origin of water from what could be a primordial reservoir. The isotope ratios for the Baffin Island basalt lavas suggest a pre-solar origin of water in Earth, probably delivered by adsorption onto dust grains. Science , this issue p. 795"
https://openalex.org/W2175115291,"After 8 years of decay of its ice shelf, Zachariæ Isstrøm, a major glacier of northeast Greenland that holds a 0.5-meter sea-level rise equivalent, entered a phase of accelerated retreat in fall 2012. The acceleration rate of its ice velocity tripled, melting of its residual ice shelf and thinning of its grounded portion doubled, and calving is now occurring at its grounding line. Warmer air and ocean temperatures have caused the glacier to detach from a stabilizing sill and retreat rapidly along a downward-sloping, marine-based bed. Its equal-ice-volume neighbor, Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden, is also melting rapidly but retreating slowly along an upward-sloping bed. The destabilization of this marine-based sector will increase sea-level rise from the Greenland Ice Sheet for decades to come."
https://openalex.org/W2150422463,"In molecular collisions, resonances occur at specific energies at which the colliding particles temporarily form quasibound complexes, resulting in rapid variations in the energy dependence of scattering cross sections. Experimentally, it has proven challenging to observe such scattering resonances, especially in differential cross sections. We report the observation of resonance fingerprints in the state-to-state differential cross sections for inelastic NO-He collisions in the 13 to 19 centimeter(-1) energy range with 0.3 centimeter(-1) resolution. The observed structures were in excellent agreement with quantum scattering calculations. They were analyzed by separating the resonance contributions to the differential cross sections from the background through a partitioning of the multichannel scattering matrix. This revealed the partial-wave composition of the resonances and their evolution during the collision."
https://openalex.org/W2180554031,"Following the end-Devonian mass extinction (359 million years ago), vertebrates experienced persistent reductions in body size for at least 36 million years. Global shrinkage was not related to oxygen or temperature, which suggests that ecological drivers played a key role in determining the length and direction of size trends. Small, fast-breeding ray-finned fishes, sharks, and tetrapods, most under 1 meter in length from snout to tail, radiated to dominate postextinction ecosystems and vertebrae biodiversity. The few large-bodied, slow-breeding survivors failed to diversify, facing extinction despite earlier evolutionary success. Thus, the recovery interval resembled modern ecological successions in terms of active selection on size and related life histories. Disruption of global vertebrate, and particularly fish, biotas may commonly lead to widespread, long-term reduction in body size, structuring future biodiversity."

https://openalex.org/W2178145614,"Monoglyceride lipase (MGL) is required for efficient hydrolysis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglyerol (2-AG) in the brain generating arachidonic acid (AA) and glycerol. This metabolic function makes MGL an interesting target for the treatment of neuroinflammation, since 2-AG exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and AA is a precursor for pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Astrocytes are an important source of AA and 2-AG, and highly express MGL. In the present study, we dissected the distinct contribution of MGL in astrocytes on brain 2-AG and AA metabolism by generating a mouse model with genetic deletion of MGL specifically in astrocytes (MKO(GFAP)). MKO(GFAP) mice exhibit moderately increased 2-AG and reduced AA levels in brain. Minor accumulation of 2-AG in the brain of MKO(GFAP) mice does not cause cannabinoid receptor desensitization as previously observed in mice globally lacking MGL. Importantly, MKO(GFAP) mice exhibit reduced brain prostaglandin E2 and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels upon peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. These observations indicate that MGL-mediated degradation of 2-AG in astrocytes provides AA for prostaglandin synthesis promoting LPS-induced neuroinflammation. The beneficial effect of astrocyte-specific MGL-deficiency is not fully abrogated by the inverse cannabinoid receptor 1 agonist SR141716 (Rimonabant) suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effects are rather caused by reduced prostaglandin synthesis than by activation of cannabinoid receptors. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that MGL in astrocytes is an important regulator of 2-AG levels, AA availability, and neuroinflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2226193377,"Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a chromatin-remodeling enzyme that has been reported to regulate DNA-damage responses through its N-terminal region in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-dependent manner. We have identified and determined the structure of a stable domain (CHD4-N) in this N-terminal region. The-fold consists of a four-α-helix bundle with structural similarity to the high mobility group box, a domain that is well known as a DNA binding module. We show that the CHD4-N domain binds with higher affinity to poly(ADP-ribose) than to DNA. We also show that the N-terminal region of CHD4, although not CHD4-N alone, is essential for full nucleosome remodeling activity and is important for localizing CHD4 to sites of DNA damage. Overall, these data build on our understanding of how CHD4-NuRD acts to regulate gene expression and participates in the DNA-damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2344188888,"Background Patients with pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS) are initially referred for hypoglycemia during the neonatal period or growth retardation during childhood. PSIS is either isolated (nonsyndromic) or associated with extra-pituitary malformations (syndromic). Objective To compare baseline characteristics and long-term evolution in patients with PSIS according to the initial presentation. Study Design Sixty-seven patients with PSIS were included. Data from subgroups were compared: neonates (n = 10) versus growth retardation patients (n = 47), and syndromic (n = 32) versus nonsyndromic patients (n = 35). Results Neonates displayed a more severe hormonal and radiological phenotype than children referred for growth retardation, with a higher incidence of multiple hormonal deficiencies (100% versus 34%; P = 0.0005) and a nonvisible anterior pituitary lobe (33% versus 2%; P = 0.0017). Regular follow-up of growth might have allowed earlier diagnosis in the children with growth retardation, as decreased growth velocity and growth retardation were present respectively 3 and 2 years before referral. We documented a progressive worsening of endocrine impairment throughout childhood in these patients. Presence of extra-pituitary malformations (found in 48%) was not associated with more severe hormonal and radiological characteristics. Growth under GH treatment was similar in the patient groups and did not vary according to the pituitary MRI findings. Conclusions PSIS diagnosed in the neonatal period has a particularly severe hormonal and radiological phenotype. The progressive worsening of endocrine impairment throughout childhood justifies periodic follow-up to check for additional hormonal deficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W2166646687,"Tryptophan metabolites in the kynurenine pathway are up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines or glucocorticoids, and are linked to anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities. In addition, they are up-regulated in pathologies such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and psychiatric disorders. The molecular mechanisms of how kynurenine pathway metabolites cause these effects are incompletely understood. On the other hand, pro-inflammatory cytokines also up-regulate the amounts of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an enzyme cofactor essential for the synthesis of several neurotransmitter and nitric oxide species. Here we show that xanthurenic acid is a potent inhibitor of sepiapterin reductase (SPR), the final enzyme in de novo BH4 synthesis. The crystal structure of xanthurenic acid bound to the active site of SPR reveals why among all kynurenine pathway metabolites xanthurenic acid is the most potent SPR inhibitor. Our findings suggest that increased xanthurenic acid levels resulting from up-regulation of the kynurenine pathway could attenuate BH4 biosynthesis and BH4-dependent enzymatic reactions, linking two major metabolic pathways known to be highly up-regulated in inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2176033889,"Species’ functional traits are an important part of the ecological complexity that determines the provisioning of ecosystem services. In biological pest control, predator response to pest density variation is a dynamic trait that impacts the provision of this service in agroecosystems. When pest populations fluctuate, farmers relying on biocontrol services need to know how natural enemies respond to these changes. Here we test the effect of variation in coffee berry borer (CBB) density on the biocontrol efficiency of a keystone ant species (Azteca sericeasur) in a coffee agroecosystem. We performed exclosure experiments to measure the infestation rate of CBB released on coffee branches in the presence and absence of ants at four different CBB density levels. We measured infestation rate as the number of CBB bored into fruits after 24 hours, quantified biocontrol efficiency (BCE) as the proportion of infesting CBB removed by ants, and estimated functional response from ant attack rates, measured as the difference in CBB infestation between branches. Infestation rates of CBB on branches with ants were significantly lower (71%-82%) than on those without ants across all density levels. Additionally, biocontrol efficiency was generally high and did not significantly vary across pest density treatments. Furthermore, ant attack rates increased linearly with increasing CBB density, suggesting a Type I functional response. These results demonstrate that ants can provide robust biological control of CBB, despite variation in pest density, and that the response of predators to pest density variation is an important factor in the provision of biocontrol services. Considering how natural enemies respond to changes in pest densities will allow for more accurate biocontrol predictions and better-informed management of this ecosystem service in agroecosystems."

In analogy to resonance detection by magnetic induction, the transverse component of a precessing dipole moment can be measured in sensitive broadband spectroscopy, here using a resonant mechanical torque sensor. Unlike induction, the torque amplitude allows equilibrium magnetic properties to be monitored simultaneously with the spin dynamics. Comprehensive electron spin resonance spectra of a single-crystal, mesoscopic yttrium iron garnet disk at room temperature reveal assisted switching between magnetization states and mode-dependent spin resonance interactions with nanoscale surface imperfections. The rich detail allows analysis of even complex three-dimensional spin textures. The flexibility of microelectromechanical and optomechanical devices combined with broad generality and capabilities of torque-mixing magnetic resonance spectroscopy offers great opportunities for development of integrated devices."
https://openalex.org/W2198528500,"TGF-β is a pleiotropic cytokine that accumulates during kidney injuries, resulting in various renal diseases. We have reported previously that TGF-β1 induces the selective up-regulation of mitochondrial Nox4, playing critical roles in podocyte apoptosis. Here we investigated the regulatory mechanism of Nox4 up-regulation by mTORC1 activation on TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in immortalized podocytes. TGF-β1 treatment markedly increased the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream targets p70S6K and 4EBP1. Blocking TGF-β receptor I with SB431542 completely blunted the phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and 4EBP1. Transient adenoviral overexpression of mTOR-WT and constitutively active mTORΔ augmented TGF-β1-treated Nox4 expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and apoptosis, whereas mTOR kinase-dead suppressed the above changes. In addition, knockdown of mTOR mimicked the effect of mTOR-KD. Inhibition of mTORC1 by low-dose rapamycin or knockdown of p70S6K protected podocytes through attenuation of Nox4 expression and subsequent oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by TGF-β1. Pharmacological inhibition of the MEK-ERK cascade, but not the PI3K-Akt-TSC2 pathway, abolished TGF-β1-induced mTOR activation. Inhibition of either ERK1/2 or mTORC1 did not reduce the TGF-β1-stimulated increase in Nox4 mRNA level but significantly inhibited total Nox4 expression, ROS generation, and apoptosis induced by TGF-β1. Moreover, double knockdown of Smad2 and 3 or only Smad4 completely suppressed TGF-β1-induced ERK1/2-mTORactivation. Our data suggest that TGF-β1 increases translation of Nox4 through the Smad-ERK1/2-mTORC1 axis, which is independent of transcriptional regulation. Activation of this pathway plays a crucial role in ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to podocyte apoptosis. Therefore, inhibition of the ERK1/2-mTORC1 pathway could be a potential therapeutic and preventive target in proteinuric and chronic kidney diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2178993367,"This study aimed to investigate the association of facial proportion and its relation to the golden ratio with the evaluation of facial appearance among Malaysian population. This was a cross-sectional study with 286 randomly selected from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) Health Campus students (150 females and 136 males; 100 Malaysian Chinese, 100 Malaysian Malay and 86 Malaysian Indian), with the mean age of 21.54 ± 1.56 (Age range, 18-25). Facial indices obtained from direct facial measurements were used for the classification of facial shape into short, ideal and long. A validated structured questionnaire was used to assess subjects' evaluation of their own facial appearance. The mean facial indices of Malaysian Indian (MI), Malaysian Chinese (MC) and Malaysian Malay (MM) were 1.59 ± 0.19, 1.57 ± 0.25 and 1.54 ± 0.23 respectively. Only MC showed significant sexual dimorphism in facial index (P = 0.047; P<0.05) but no significant difference was found between races. Out of the 286 subjects, 49 (17.1%) were of ideal facial shape, 156 (54.5%) short and 81 (28.3%) long. The facial evaluation questionnaire showed that MC had the lowest satisfaction with mean score of 2.18 ± 0.97 for overall impression and 2.15 ± 1.04 for facial parts, compared to MM and MI, with mean score of 1.80 ± 0.97 and 1.64 ± 0.74 respectively for overall impression; 1.75 ± 0.95 and 1.70 ± 0.83 respectively for facial parts.1) Only 17.1% of Malaysian facial proportion conformed to the golden ratio, with majority of the population having short face (54.5%); 2) Facial index did not depend significantly on races; 3) Significant sexual dimorphism was shown among Malaysian Chinese; 4) All three races are generally satisfied with their own facial appearance; 5) No significant association was found between golden ratio and facial evaluation score among Malaysian population."

To determine the role of connexin43 in salivary gland development, we analyzed its expression in developing submandibular glands (SMGs). Connexin43 (Cx43) was found to be expressed in salivary gland epithelium. In ex vivo organ cultures of SMGs, addition of the gap junctional inhibitors 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid (18α-GA) and oleamide inhibited SMG branching morphogenesis, suggesting that gap junctional communication contributes to salivary gland development. In Cx43−/− salivary glands, submandibular and sublingual gland size was reduced as compared with those from heterozygotes. The expression of Pdgfa, Pdgfb, Fgf7, and Fgf10, which induced branching of SMGs in Cx43−/− samples, were not changed as compared with those from heterozygotes. Furthermore, the blocking peptide for the hemichannel and gap junction channel showed inhibition of terminal bud branching. FGF10 induced branching morphogenesis, while it did not rescue the Cx43−/− phenotype, thus Cx43 may regulate FGF10 signaling during salivary gland development.

A connexon exists either as a single unit within the plasma membrane, known as a hemichannel, or is associated with a connexon from an opposing cell to form a gap junction channel (2Goodenough D.A.

A mutation in the gene encoding the nearly ubiquitously expressed connexin43 results in development of oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD), a predominantly autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by several common clinical phenotypes, such as syndactyly of the digits, microdontia, enamel hypoplasia, ophthalmic defects, and craniofacial abnormalities (3Paznekas W.A.

Civitelli R. Gap junctions in skeletal development and function.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1719: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In particular, germline ablation of Gja1, the gene encoding Cx43, results in delayed endochondral and intramembranous ossification, osteoblast dysfunction, and craniofacial abnormalities (6Lecanda F.

Because of the perinatal lethality of the germline mutation, which results in heart and lung abnormalities, a method for tissue-specific Gja1 ablation has been developed. Conditional ablation of the Gja1 gene regulated by the Col1A1 promoter, which is expressed in committed osteoblasts, results in accrual of a low peak bone mass and attenuates response to the anabolic effects of parathyroid hormone, the consequence of an osteoblast defect (7Chung D.J.

This evidence suggests that Cx43 is important for development of hard tissues, including bone and tooth. Epithelial and mesenchymal interactions are important for development of a variety of organs, including teeth, salivary glands, mammary glands, lungs, and kidneys.

The expression and distribution of connexins have been investigated in salivary glands of mature rats, with high levels of Cx32 and Cx26 expression, but none of Cx43, observed in rat salivary glands (15Meda P. Pepper M.S. Traub O. Willecke K. Gros D. Beyer E. Nicholson B. Paul D. Orci L. Differential expression of gap junction connexins in endocrine and exocrine glands.Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2371-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In contrast, Cx32 was found to be located exclusively between acinar cells (16Muramatsu T. Hashimoto S. Shimono M. Differential expression of gap junction proteins connexin32 and 43 in rat submandibular and sublingual glands.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, Cx43 expression in the early embryonic stage has not been clearly identified. The role of gap junctions in salivary gland morphogenesis has also not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of Cx43 in salivary gland branching morphogenesis, and our findings showed that Cx43 is necessary for branching morphogenesis and salivary epithelium proliferation via FGF10-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in salivary gland epithelium. ICR mouse heads were dissected on E13.5, E16, or postnatal day 1 (P1) and fixed with 4% PFA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C. The tissues were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co.) for frozen sectioning, then cut into 8-μm sections with a cryostat (2800 FRIGOCUT; Leica). Submandibular and sublingual salivary gland rudiments (referred to as SMGs in this study) were dissected from E16.5 connexin 43 heterozygote (Cx43+/−) and homozygote (Cx43−/−) specimens, and fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 4% PFA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fixed submandibular glands were washed three times in PBS, then dehydrated using alcohol and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at a thickness of 10 μm and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. For immunostaining, sections were incubated in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h before incubation with the primary antibody. Primary antibodies specific for connexin 43 (SC-9059: Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were detected using Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). A fluorescence microscope (BZ-8000, KEYENCE Co, Osaka, Japan) was used for imaging analysis. Images were prepared using a BZ analyzer (KEYENCE) and Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc.). SMGs were dissected from E13 ICR mice, then Cx43+/− and Cx43−/− specimens were cultured on PET track-etched membranes (BD Falcon) with a pore size of 0.4 μm at the air/medium interface. The filters were floated on 2 ml of DMEM/F12 in 6-well culture plates (BD Falcon). The medium was supplemented with 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 mg/ml of streptomycin, and 150 mg/ml of vitamin C, with or without 5 μg/ml 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid (18α-GA: Sigma-Aldrich) or oleamide (Sigma-Aldrich). Five SMGs were cultured on each filter at 37 °C in an atmosphere of humidified 5% CO2/95% air. When an exogenous platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was used, either 10 ng/ml of PDGF-AA (Upstate), 1 ng/ml of PDGF-BB (R&D Systems), 100 ng/ml of FGF7 (R&D Systems), 500 ng/ml of FGF10 (R&D Systems), or Cx43 peptide (Cx2605-P-5: Alpha Diagnostic International) (17Desplantez T.

Each experiment was repeated at least five times. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) from E13.5, E16, and P1 submandibular glands, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized at 50 °C for 60 min using oligo(dT) or random primers with the SuperScript III First-strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with Takara Ex Taq (Takara) for semi-quantitative RT-PCR or using SYBR green PCR reagent (Applied Biosystems) for real-time PCR. Primers for PDGF-A (Pdgfa), PDGF-B (Pdgfb), PGF receptor α (pdgfrα), PDGF receptor β (Pdgfrβ), FGF7, FGF10, FGF receptor 1b (Fgfr1b), FGF receptor 2b (Fgfr2b), and Hprt were prepared as previously described (18Yamamoto S.

Primers forconnexin 43 (forward 5′-GAGTCAGCTTGGGGTGATGAACAG-3′, reverse 5′-AGCAGGAAGGCCACCTCGAAGACAGAC-3′), Bmp2 (forward 5′-GGGACCCGCTGTCTTCTAGT-3′, reverse 5′-TCAACTCAAATTCGCTGAGGAC-3′), and Bmp4 (forward 5′-ACTGCCGCAGCTTCTCTGAG-3′, reverse 5′-TTCTCCAGATGTTCTTCGTG-3′) were used for real-time PCR. PCR amplicons were separated and visualized on 1.5% agarose gels after staining with SYBR Green using the ImageQuant LAS 4000 Mini image analysis system (GE Healthcare Life Science). Statistical analysis of gene expression was performed using Student's t test. After treatment with FGF10 with or without 18α-GA or MEK inhibitor U0126 (Cell Signaling), BrdU was added to the plates (10 μm) for 30 min, then HSY cells from a human salivary cell line were fixed with cold methanol for 10 min, rehydrated in PBS, and incubated for 30 min in 1.5 m HCl. After washing three times in PBS, the organs were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (Roche, Manheim, Germany) for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the cells were washed 3 times in PBS and the nuclei stained with propidium iodide (Vector laboratories). BrdU-positive cells were examined under a microscope (Biozero-8000; Keyence, Japan), as previously described. HSY cells or primary cultured E14.5 SMG mesenchymal cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS with or without 5 μm 18α-GA, 1 μm Cx43 peptide, and siRNA for Cx43, after stimulation with 500 ng/ml FGF10 at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were washed twice with 1 mm ice-cold sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) in PBS, lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer supplemented with a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and centrifuged, then the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Lysates were separated using 4–12% SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE: Invitrogen) and analyzed by Western blotting. The blotted membranes were incubated with antibodies for ERK1/2 or phosho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), then detected with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized using the ImageQuant LAS 4000 Mini image analysis system (GE Healthcare Life Science). HSY cells were grown in 96-well plates for 3 days and loaded with 5 μm Fura-2AM (Invitrogen) prepared in HBSS for 45 min at 37 °C. The Ca2+ transients were recorded as the 340/380 nm ratio (R) of the resulting 510-nm emissions using a plate reader (Mithras LB 940; Berthold Technologies). For stimulation, 500 ng/ml FGF10 was automatically injected into the cells using the Mithras 940. For inhibition experiments, cells were incubated for 30 min before analysis with 1 μm Cx43 peptide for blocking the hemichannel and gap junction channel, or 100 μm 2-APB for blocking IP3R. [Ca2+]i levels were calculated as previously described (19Ishikawa M. Iwamoto T. Fukumoto S. Yamada Y. Pannexin 3 inhibits proliferation of osteoprogenitor cells by regulating Wnt and p21 signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 2839-2851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Connexin 43 (Cx43) is a gap junctional protein, though its expression in salivary glands has not been identified. To examine the expression of Cx43 in salivary gland development, we performed immunostaining using an antibody for mouse Cx43 and found that it was expressed in salivary gland epithelium, but not in neural crest-derived mesenchyme tissues obtained on E13.5 (Fig. 1A). In E16 tissues, Cx43 was shown to be expressed in salivary gland epithelium with nonspecific staining in blood cells, though the level of expression was reduced as compared with that on E13.5. In P1 tissues, Cx43 was weakly expressed (Fig. 1, A and C). Real-time PCR assays of micro-dissected samples revealed that Cx43 was highly expressed in salivary gland epithelium, but not in mesenchyme on E13.5 (Fig. 1B). Thus, Cx43 may regulate the proliferation and differentiation of salivary gland epithelium. To examine the role of Cx43 in salivary gland development, especially branching morphogenesis, we performed SMG organ cultures with or without the gap junctional inhibitors 18α-GA and oleamide. Both inhibited branching morphogenesis in SMG organ cultures at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 2, A and B). Previously, we showed that exogenously added PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB in organ cultures induced the expression of FGF-7 and FGF-10 in salivary gland mesenchyme (18Yamamoto S. Fukumoto E. Yoshizaki K. Iwamoto T. Yamada A. Tanaka K. Suzuki H. Aizawa S. Arakaki M. Yuasa K. Oka K. Chai Y. Nonaka K. Fukumoto S. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor regulates salivary gland morphogenesis via fibroblast growth factor expression.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23139-23149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), while FGF7 and FGF10 have been shown to induce epithelial proliferation and branching morphogenesis of SMGs (14Hoffman M.P. Kidder B.L. Steinberg Z.L. Lakhani S. Ho S. Kleinman H.K. Larsen M. Gene expression profiles of mouse submandibular gland development: FGFR1 regulates branching morphogenesis in vitro through BMP- and FGF-dependent mechanisms.Development. 2002; 129: 5767-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In the presence of 2 and 5 μm of 18α-GA, the numbers of terminal buds in SMG organ cultures were dramatically decreased, while PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, FGF7, and FGF10 partially rescued the branching of SMGs inhibited by 2 μm, but not that inhibited by 5 μm of 18α-GA (Fig. 2C). These findings indicate that gap junctional communication may regulate branching morphogenesis induced by PDGF or FGF signaling. Since 18α-GA and oleamide are general gap junctional inhibitors, they inhibit not only Cx43 but also other gap junctional proteins. To identify the role of Cx43 in salivary gland development, we examined the phenotype of Cx43-disrupted mice. Cx43−/− mice on P1 showed smaller sized SMGs as compared with those from Cx43+/− mice, while the SMG weight in Cx43−/− mice was reduced by ∼50% (Fig. 3A). Also, atrophic terminal buds with mesenchymal tissues were observed in the Cx43−/− tissues (Fig. 3B), while the numbers and size of terminal buds were reduced in both mucous and serous glands of Cx43−/− mice (Fig. 3, C and D). Together, these results indicate that Cx43 is necessary for salivary gland development. Our previous study revealed that PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB induce FGF7 and FGF10 in salivary gland mesenchymal cells, while FGF7 and FGF10 induce epithelial cell proliferation, indicating that both PDGF and FGF signaling are important for salivary gland branching morphogenesis. In Cx43−/− salivary glands, the expression of Pdgfa, Pdgfb, Pdgfrα, Pdgfrβ, Fgf7, and Fgf10 mRNA were not different as compared with those from the heterozygotes (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, the expression of Fgfr1b and Fgfr2b in Cx43−/− salivary gland epithelium was decreased as compared with the heterozygotes (Fig. 4C). Reduced expression of Fgfr1b and Fgfr2b may affect branching morphogenesis in Cx43−/− salivary glands. In addition, BMP2 and BMP4 are known to be inhibitory factors for salivary gland branching morphogenesis (14Hoffman M.P. Kidder B.L. Steinberg Z.L. Lakhani S. Ho S. Kleinman H.K. Larsen M.

Martin G.R. FGF-4 and BMP-2 have opposite effects on limb growth.Nature. 1993; 361: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In the Cx43−/− specimens, Bmp2 expression was not changed. However, Bmp4 was reduced as compared with the heterozygotes (Fig. 5), indicating that BMP signaling in salivary glands may not affect the phenotype of SMG in Cx43−/−.FIGURE 5Expression of Cx43, Bmp2, and Bmp4 in SMGs from C43+/− and Cx43−/− mice. A, mRNA expression of Cx43, Bmp2, and Bmp4 were analyzed by RT-PCR.

Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA (n = 3 per group; *, p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the branching morphogenesis of Cx43−/− salivary gland, we performed ex vivo organ cultures. Branching of terminal buds was dramatically inhibited in the cultures of Cx43−/− salivary glands at 48 h, similar to the histology of Cx43−/− (Fig. 6). FGF10-enhanced branching in control samples has been reported (21Steinberg Z. Myers C. Heim V.M. Lathrop C.A. Rebustini I.T. Stewart J.S. Larsen M. Hoffman M.P. FGFR2b signaling regulates ex vivo submandibular gland epithelial cell proliferation and branching morphogenesis.Development. 2005; 132: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, addition of FGF10 did not affect the Cx43−/− salivary gland organ cultures in our study, suggesting that FGF10 signaling in salivary gland epithelium is disturbed in Cx43−/− mice (Fig. 6). To confirm the role of Cx43 in salivary gland morphogenesis, a Cx43 peptide that inhibits gap junction function was added to the organ cultures. Peptides homologous to the first extracellular loop motifs of Cx43 reversibly abolish rhythmic contractile activity in arteries (22Chaytor A.T. Evans W.H. Griffith T.M. Peptides homologous to extracellular loop motifs of connexin 43 reversibly abolish rhythmic contractile activity in rabbit arteries.J. Physiol. 1997; 503: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In our experiment, addition of a Cx43 peptide inhibited salivary gland branching. On the other hand, the control peptide did not have an effect on branching morphogenesis (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Cx43 peptide inhibited SMG branching morphogenesis.

To evaluate the role of Cx43 in salivary gland epithelium development, we examined FGF10 signaling using HSY cells from human salivary epithelium. FGF10 induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in HSY cells after 5 min, while the gap junction inhibitor 18α-GA inhibited FGF10-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 8, A and B). Furthermore, a Cx43 peptide and siRNA for Cx43 inhibited FGF10-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a manner similar to 18α-GA (Fig. 8C). FGF10 also induced HSY cell proliferation, whereas 18α-GA and the MEK inhibitor U0126 inhibited FGF10-induced cell proliferation (Fig. 8D). Cx43 functions not only in cell-to-cell gap junctional communication but also as a hemichannel-regulating signaling molecule to moderate intracellular calcium level. To examine the role of Cx43 in intracellular calcium level regulation, we performed a [Ca2+]i measurement assay using Fura-2AM. FGF10 increased the level of [Ca2+]i in salivary gland epithelial cells, while 2-APB, an IP3R inhibitor, inhibited Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum and the increase of [Ca2+]i induced by FGF10 (Fig. 8E). Furthermore, the Cx43 peptide partially inhibited increased [Ca2+]i, indicating that Cx43 may be important for the initial increase of [Ca2+]i following stimulation by FGF10 via the hemichannel. PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB were previously found to induce FGF7 and FGF10 expression in salivary gland epithelium, and then promote epithelial cell proliferation (18Yamamoto S. Fukumoto E. Yoshizaki K.

To examine the role of Cx43 in salivary gland mesenchymal cells, we examined PDGF signaling using primary cultures of E14 mouse salivary gland epithelium specimens. PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB were separately added to cultures of salivary gland mesenchymal cells, and both induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In contrast, 18α-GA did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 9A) or proliferation of salivary gland mesenchymal cells (Fig. 9B), indicating that Cx43 regulates growth factor signaling in salivary gland epithelial cells, but not in mesenchymal cells.FIGURE 9PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB each induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in primary cultures of mouse salivary gland mesenchymal cells.

https://openalex.org/W2263154217,"Malaria still remains a major health issue in Ghana despite the introduction of Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) coupled with other preventative measures such as the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs). The global quest for eradication of malaria has heightened the interest of identifying drugs that target the sexual stage of the parasite, referred to as transmission-blocking drugs. This study aimed at assessing the efficacy and gametocydal effects of some commonly used herbal malaria products in Ghana.After identifying herbal anti-malarial products frequently purchased on the Ghanaian market, ten of them were selected and lyophilized. In vitro drug sensitivity testing of different concentrations of the herbal products was carried out on asexual and in vitro generated gametocytes of the 3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. The efficacies of the products were assessed by microscopy. Cultures containing low dose of RT also produced the least number of late stage gametocytes. Two of the herbal products CM and RT inhibited the growth of late stage gametocytes by > 80% at 100 μg/ml whilst KG was the most inhibitory to early stage gametocytes at that same concentration. However at 1 μg/ml, only YF significantly inhibited the survival of late stage gametocytes although at that same concentration YF barely inhibited the survival of early stage gametocytes.Herbal product RT (Aloe schweinfurthii, Khaya senegalensis, Piliostigma thonningii and Cassia siamea) demonstrated properties of a highly efficacious gametocydal product. Low dose of herbal product RT exhibited the highest gametocydal activity and at 100 μg/ml, RT exhibited >80% inhibition of late stage gametocytes. However inhibition of asexual stage parasite by RT was not optimal. Improving the asexual inhibition of RT could convert RT into an ideal antimalarial herbal product. We also found that generally C. sanguinolenta containing herbal products exhibited gametocydal activity in addition to high asexual efficacy. Herbal products with high gametocydal activity can help in the fight to reduce malaria transmission."

Ras proteins are mutated in 30% of all human tumors, contributing to several malignant phenotypes, including abnormal cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis (1Pylayeva-Gupta Y. Grabocka E.

The major Ras isoforms, H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras, are closely related, bearing 85% amino acid sequence identity; however, 85% of clinically observed Ras mutations occur in K-Ras (4Downward J. Targeting RAS signalling pathways in cancer therapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Point mutations at codon 12 impair the GTPase activity of Ras isoforms both by preventing productive binding of GTPase-activating proteins that accelerate GTP hydrolysis and by suppressing intrinsic (basal) GTP hydrolase activity.

Sos contains two domains that are essential for Ras nucleotide exchange, namely the Ras exchanger motif domain and the Cdc25 domain.

One current model is that weak binding of Ras·GDP at the distal (allosteric) site causes basal activation of Sos for further catalytic site binding (11Sondermann H. Soisson S.M. Boykevisch S.

Additionally, the binding at the allosteric site (and hence the activation of Sos) is regulated and autoinhibited by interactions with neighboring histone, Dbl homology (DH), and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of Sos (11Sondermann H.

Currently, nucleotide exchange at the catalytic site is presumed to be passive: GDP is exchanged for GTP driven through the higher cytosolic concentration of GTP (3Buday L. Downward J. Many faces of Ras activation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1786: 178-187PubMed Google Scholar).

However, it is unclear whether or how rebinding of GDP or GTP to nucleotide-free Ras (a presumed transition state) at the catalytic site of Sos occurs and how this triggers the dissociation of Ras upon completion of nucleotide exchange, allowing Sos to engage in further cycles of guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity. Binding of Ras·GTP at the allosteric site and thus activation of Sos increases affinity of Ras·GDP binding at the catalytic site with a measured Kd of 1.9 μm (11Sondermann H. Soisson S.M.

The model of Sos activation by binding of Ras to the allosteric site is based on static snap shots from x-ray crystal structures (10Margarit S.M. Sondermann H. Hall B.E. Nagar B. Hoelz A.

Indeed, recent single molecule studies have suggested a critical role for dynamic fluctuations in the allosteric activation of Sos by Ras·GTP and hinted at the possibility that Ras·GDP can also activate Sos (13Iversen L. Tu H.-L. Lin W.-C. Christensen S.M. Abel S.M. Iwig J. Wu H.-J. Gureasko J. Rhodes C. Petit R.S. Hansen S.D. Thill P. Yu C.-H. Stamou D. Chakraborty A.K. Kuriyan J. Groves J.T.

How these fluctuations are modulated at a detailed structural level and whether Ras·GDP can bind with sufficient affinity to the allosteric site to activate Sos remain to be established. Previous solution NMR studies, which can capture the dynamic behavior of proteins, have explored the process of GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange in H-Ras (15Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Prinz H.

To our knowledge, no detailed solution studies of the Ras-Sos interactions using NMR spectroscopy have yet been reported. Here, we used NMR to dissect Ras-Sos interactions. Signal perturbations were used to monitor changes in Ras and Sos upon binding, depending on their stoichiometry and type of nucleotide present. Moreover, we introduced a number of non-perturbing probes (13C-labeled methyls of methionines (26Sprangers R. Kay L.E. Quantitative dynamics and binding studies of the 20S proteasome by NMR.Nature. 2007; 445: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar)) into Sos and used them to monitor Ras binding separately to the allosteric and catalytic sites. Using intrinsic fluorescence, we also measured the binding affinity to Sos of wild-type (WT) as well as functional mutants of Ras in various nucleotide-loaded forms. Our data have enabled us to disentangle the binding preferences of GTP- and GDP-loaded forms of Ras in solution at the specific sites on Sos. H-Ras (residues 1-166), K-Ras (residues 1–166), SosCat (residues 563–1049), and SosHD-DH-PH-Cat (residues 1–1049) gene sequences were synthesized by Geneart (Life Technologies) and cloned into a pET28b vector with an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site prior to the protein sequence. Proteins were expressed in BL21-GOLD(DE3) competent cells, and the seeder cultures were grown in Luria broth (LB) medium. All samples were grown using a similar protocol (27Vo U. Embrey K.J. Breeze A.L. Golovanov A.P. 1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignment for the human K-Ras at physiological pH.Biomol. NMR Assign. 2013; 7: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) for unlabeled and uniformly 15N-labeled H-Ras samples. WT and mutant Sos constructs (SosCat and SosHD-DH-PH-Cat) were grown in minimal M9 medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline antibiotics supplemented with micronutrients and vitamins. Cells were then induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside followed by the addition of 2 g/liter d-glucose. Uniformly recombinant SosCat 13C-labeled at the Met (ϵ-) and Ile (δ1-)methyl positions ([13C-methyl-Met,Ile]SosCat) was produced under a similar protocol in D2O but with an additional feed of 200 mg/liter [13C]methyl-Met, 120 mg/liter [13C]methyl-α-ketobutyrate, and 2 g/liter d7-d-glucose administered at the point of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside induction. Protein purification was carried out as described previously (27Vo U. Embrey K.J. Breeze A.L. Golovanov A.P. 1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignment for the human K-Ras at physiological pH.Biomol. NMR Assign. 2013; 7: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, all proteins were cleaved from their N-terminal His6 tags using tobacco etch virus protease. Purified H-Ras samples were incubated with a 20-fold excess of GTPγS, GppNp, or GppCp and 1100-fold His-tagged Sos in 50 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 at pH 7.4. The samples were left overnight at 4 °C to allow nucleotide exchange. The mixture was then passed through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with 30 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 at pH 7.0 to remove the His6-tagged Sos and free nucleotide. The samples were concentrated using 0.5-ml VivaSpin concentrators (Sartorius; 10,000 molecular weight cutoff). Protein concentration was determined by standard Bradford assays. Nucleotide exchange was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. For the preparation of the nucleotide-free form of Ras (hereafter referred to as H-RasNF), H-Ras·GDP (200 μm) sample was incubated with 20 mm EDTA to strip the Mg2+ and nucleotide from Ras. After 2 h, the sample was passed down a pre-equilibrated Nap-5 column (GE Healthcare) to exchange the sample into Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm l-Arg and l-Glu to improve sample stability for the duration of NMR measurements (28Golovanov A.P. Hautbergue G.M. Wilson S.A. Lian L.Y. A simple method for improving protein solubility and long-term stability.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8933-8939Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). H-RasNF was then concentrated down as required using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore) with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff. All NMR spectra were collected at 298 K (unless stated otherwise) on Bruker 600- and 800-MHz (Avance I and III, respectively) spectrometers equipped with 5-mm TCI CryoProbes with z-axis gradients using standard experiments and parameters from the Bruker library. Uniformly 15N-labeled H-Ras was used at a concentration of 100 μm, and [13C-methyl-Met,Ile]SosCat was used at 60 μm with concentrations of added non-labeled protein variants as indicated. NMR samples containing proteins or their mixtures were prepared in either phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 or Hepes buffer at pH 7.4 supplemented with 5% D2O and placed in a Shigemi tube. All spectra were processed in Topspin 2.1 or 3.1 and analyzed in NMRViewJ (29Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. NMR View: a computer program for the visualization and analysis of NMR data.J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar). Fluorescence binding assays were performed using a luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with emission and excitation slits set to 3 and 10 nm, respectively. Samples were measured in 1-ml quartz cuvettes with path lengths of 1 and 0.4 cm used for excitation (295 nm) and emission (336 nm), respectively. Data points were taken in quadruplicate with a scan speed of 300 ns/min. WT SosCat or SosHD-DH-PH-Cat samples (10 μm) were incubated with increasing amounts of Ras (1–50 μm) in Hepes buffer. To obtain the dissociation constant of binding (Kd), the quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of the Trp residues in Sos upon addition of the non-fluorescent Ras protein was monitored. The weak contribution of intrinsic fluorescence of Ras as well as the change in fluorescence due to dilution effects were taken into account and compensated for. Fluorescence experiments were repeated three times. Data points were fitted (change in fluorescence versus Ras concentration) using non-linear regression to a standard quadratic binding equation using GraFit (30Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 3.0. Data Analysis and Graphics program for the IBM PC. Erithacus Software, Surrey, UK1992Google Scholar). The overall apparent binding affinities of Ras to Sos were determined by monitoring the change (i.e. quenching) in Sos fluorescence upon the formation of the Ras/Sos complex (Fig. 1). This approach relied on the strong intrinsic fluorescence signal of the multiple Trp residues within the SosCat and SosHD-DH-PH-Cat. Ras is devoid of Trp residues, and therefore its intrinsic fluorescence signal at 295 nm is negligible. To determine the affinities accurately, the minor dilution effect and the background fluorescence of Ras (without Sos) were further subtracted from the overall fluorescence. First, we explored the differences in binding of the isoforms H-Ras and K-Ras as well as K-RasG12V, a common cancer-associated mutant, to Sos when Ras was loaded with different stable analogs of GTP. Traditionally, nucleotide exchange has been studied using fluorescently labeled analogs such as mantGTP (11Sondermann H. Soisson S.M. Boykevisch S. Yang S.S. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J.

For these reasons, we used unlabeled slowly or non-hydrolyzable GTP mimics (GTPγS, GppNp, and GppCp) in our study coupled with measurement of intrinsic protein fluorescence. Dissociation constants (Kd) for interactions of H-Ras·GTPγS, H-Ras·GppNp, and H-Ras·GppCp with SosCat are generally very similar to each other (∼5–8 μm) (Table 1). Conversely, the affinity of H-Ras·GDP for SosCat is ∼10-fold weaker (Kd ∼ 54 μm) (Table 1). These results are in agreement with the affinities previously measured for Ras·GDP binding at the allosteric site of non-activated Sos (11Sondermann H. Soisson S.M. Boykevisch S. Yang S.S.

In addition, the binding of K-Ras·GTPγS to SosCat (Kd = 10 ± 1 μm) is stronger than the binding of K-RasG12V·GTPγS (Kd = 31 ± 2 μm) but comparable with binding affinities of H-Ras loaded with GTP analogs (Table 1). This suggests that WT K-Ras and H-Ras have fairly similar Sos binding properties, whereas the oncogenic mutation K-RasG12V has reduced binding aff"

Synthetic ACTH may be advantageous with reported remission rates up to 85% and few side effects. We conducted a prospective open label cohort study from 2008 till 2010 (NCT00694863). We prospectively selected patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy and high risk for progression (defined as βeta-2-microglobulin (β2m) excretion of >500 ng/min). For comparison, we selected matched historical controls treated with cyclophosphamide. The prospectively selected patients received intramuscular injections of synthetic ACTH during 9 months (maximal dose 1 mg twice a week). The primary endpoints concerned the feasibility and incidence of remissions as a primary event. Secondary endpoints included side effects of treatment and the incidence of remissions and relapses at long-term follow-up. Twenty patients (15 men) were included (age 54±14 years, serum creatinine 104 μmol/l [IQR 90–113], urine protein:creatinine ratio 8.7 g/10 mmol creatinine [IQR 4.3–11.1]). Seventeen patients (85%) completed treatment. 97% of injections were administered correctly. Cumulative remission rate was 55% (complete remission in 4 patients, partial remission 7 patients). In a group of historical controls treated with cyclophosphamide and steroids, 19 of 20 patients (95%) developed a remission (complete remission in 13 patients, partial remission in 6 patients) (p<0.01). The main limitation of our study is its small size and the use of a historical control group. We show that treatment with intramuscular injections of synthetic ACTH is feasible. Our data suggest that synthetic ACTH is less effective than cyclophosphamide in inducing a remission in high risk patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy. The use of synthetic ACTH was also associated with many adverse events. Therefore, we advise against synthetic ACTH as standard treatment in membranous nephropathy."

https://openalex.org/W2286853714,"Background It is well-recognized that diabetes represents a powerful independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, very few studies have investigated the relationship between diabetes and risk of aortic dissection (AD). Aim The aim of this case-control study was to evaluate the association between diabetes and risk of AD in Chinese population. Methods A hospital-based case-control study, consisting of 2160 AD patients and 4320 controls, was conducted in a Chinese population. Demographic, clinical characteristics and risk factors were collected. Diabetes rate of patients with overall AD, Stanford type A AD and type B AD group was compared with that of corresponding matched control groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for relationship between diabetes and AD risk. Results The prevalence of diabetes was lower in AD cases than that of control subjects, whether it is the overall AD, type A AD or type B AD group (4.7% vs. 10.0%, 2.9% vs. 8.8%, 5.9% vs. 10.9%, all P<0.001). Furthermore, in multivariate model, diabetes was found to be associated with lower AD risk, which not only applies to the overall AD (OR = 0.2, 95%CI: 0.15–0.26), but also type A AD (OR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.07–0.20) and type B AD (OR = 0.25, 95%CI: 0.18–0.33). Conclusions We observed the paradoxical inverse relationship between DM and risk of AD in the Chinese population. These results suggest diabetes may play a protective role in the development of AD. However, further studies are needed to enrich related evidence, especially with regard to underlying mechanisms for these trends."

Pakistan has one of the highest burdens of tuberculosis in the world, yet there have been no qualitative studies in Pakistan that have specifically examined why default occurs. We conducted a mixed methods study at a tuberculosis clinic in Karachi to understand why patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis default from treatment, and to identify factors associated with default. Patients attending this clinic pick up medications weekly and undergo family-supported directly observed therapy. Methods In-depth interviews were administered to 21 patients who had defaulted. We also compared patients who defaulted with those who were cured, had completed, or had failed treatment in 2013. Results Qualitative analyses showed the most common reasons for default were the financial burden of treatment, and medication side effects and beliefs. The influence of finances on other causes of default was also prominent, as was concern about the effect of treatment on family members. In quantitative analysis, of 2120 patients, 301 (14.2%) defaulted. Univariate analysis found that male gender (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.04–1.71), being 35–59 years of age (OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.14–2.08), or being 60 years of age or older (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.17–2.88) were associated with default. After adjusting for gender, disease site, and patient category, being 35–59 years of age (aOR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.10–2.03) or 60 years of age or older (aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.12–2.77) were associated with default. Conclusions In multivariate analysis age was the only variable associated with default. This lack of identifiable risk factors and our qualitative findings imply that default is complex and often due to extrinsic and medication-related factors. More tolerable medications, improved side effect management, and innovative cost-reduction measures are needed to reduce default from tuberculosis treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2206736989,"Prior to age four, children succeed in non-elicited-response false-belief tasks but fail elicited-response false-belief tasks. To explain this discrepancy, the processing-load account argues that the capacity to represent beliefs emerges in infancy, as indicated by early success on non-elicited-response tasks, but that children’s ability to demonstrate this capacity depends on the processing demands of the task and children’s processing skills. When processing demands exceed young children’s processing abilities, such as in standard elicited-response tasks, children fail despite their capacity to represent beliefs. Support for this account comes from recent evidence that reducing processing demands improves young children’s performance: when demands are sufficiently reduced, 2.5-year-olds succeed in elicited-response tasks. Here we sought complementary evidence for the processing-load account by examining whether increasing processing demands impeded children’s performance in a non-elicited-response task. 3-year-olds were tested in a preferential-looking task in which they heard a change-of-location false-belief story accompanied by a picture book; across children, we manipulated the amount of linguistic ambiguity in the story. The final page of the book showed two images: one that was consistent with the main character’s false belief and one that was consistent with reality. When the story was relatively unambiguous, children looked reliably longer at the false-belief-consistent image, successfully demonstrating their false-belief understanding. When the story was ambiguous, however, this undermined children’s performance: looking times to the belief-consistent image were correlated with verbal ability, and only children with verbal skills in the upper quartile of the sample demonstrated a significant preference for the belief-consistent image. These results support the processing-load account by demonstrating that regardless of whether a task involves an elicited response, children’s performance depends on the processing demands of the task and their processing skills. These findings also have implications for alternative, deflationary accounts of early false-belief understanding."

Imaging examinations ([18F]-FDG PET/CT and diffusion-weighted MRI) were performed on the same day, up to one day prior to the beginning of the first treatment cycle, and on the 14th day of the first chemotherapy cycle. Treatment response was evaluated based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and World Health Organization (WHO) morphological criteria, as well as PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) metabolic criteria.Seventy-five lesions were examined in 23 patients. Pre- and post-treatment comparisons of data pertaining to all target lesions revealed reductions in tumor size and SUV, as well as increases in ADC values, all of which were statistically significant. The increase in ADC following treatment was significantly higher in patients classified as complete responders by both morphological criteria than that observed in any of the other patient groups of response. Patients with a complete metabolic response also showed greater increases in ADC values as compared to the remaining groups.The assessment of tumor response based on diffusion-weighted MRI showed an increase in the ADC of cervical lesions following treatment, which was corroborated by morphological and metabolic findings. Associations between changes in ADC values and treatment response categories using morphologic criteria and [18F]-FDG PET/CT were only identified in complete responders."

We demonstrate inhibition by a dipeptidyl nitrile inhibitor (compound 1) of cathepsin B activity and also of pericellular degradation of dye-quenched collagen IV by living breast cancer cells. To image, localize and quantify collagen IV degradation in real-time we used 3D pathomimetic breast cancer models designed to mimic the in vivo microenvironment of breast cancers. We further report the synthesis and characterization of a caged version of compound 1, [Ru(bpy)2(1)2](BF4)2 (compound 2), which can be photoactivated with visible light. Upon light activation, compound 2, like compound 1, inhibited cathepsin B activity and pericellular collagen IV degradation by the 3D pathomimetic models of living breast cancer cells, without causing toxicity. We suggest that caged inhibitor 2 is a prototype for cathepsin B inhibitors that can control both the site and timing of inhibition in cancer."

In this study, we transformed pprI into Lactococcus lactis strain MG1363 using the lactococcal shuttle vector pMG36e and investigated its effects on the tolerance and lactic acid production of L. lactis while under stress. PprI was stably expressed in L. lactis as confirmed by western blot assays. L. lactis expressing PprI exhibited significantly improved resistance to oxidative stress and high osmotic pressure. This enhanced cellular tolerance to stressors might be due to the regulation of resistance-related genes (e.g., recA, recO, sodA, and nah) by pprI. Moreover, transformed L. lactis demonstrated increased lactic acid production, attributed to enhanced lactate dehydrogenase activity. These results suggest that pprI can improve the tolerance of L. lactis to environmental stresses, and this transformed bacterial strain is a promising candidate for industrial applications of lactic acid production."
https://openalex.org/W2178190191,"In clinical settings, rapid and accurate characterization of pathogens is essential for effective treatment of patients; however, subtle genetic changes in pathogens which elude traditional phenotypic typing may confer dangerous pathogenic properties such as toxicity, antibiotic resistance, or virulence. Existing options for molecular typing techniques characterize the critical genomic changes that distinguish harmful and benign strains, yet the well-established approaches, in particular those that rely on electrophoretic separation of nucleic acid fragments on a gel, have room for only incremental future improvements in speed, cost, and complexity. Solid-state nanopores are an emerging class of single-molecule sensors that can electrophoretically characterize charged biopolymers, and which offer significant advantages in terms of sample and reagent requirements, readout speed, parallelization, and automation. We present here the first application of nanopores for single-molecule molecular typing using length based ""fingerprints"" of critical sites in bacterial genomes. This technique is highly adaptable for detection of different types of genetic variation; as we illustrate using prototypical examples including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and methicillin-resistant Streptococcus aureus, the solid-state nanopore diagnostic platform may be used to detect large insertions or deletions, small insertions or deletions, and even single-nucleotide variations in bacterial DNA. We further show that Bayesian classification of test samples can provide highly confident pathogen typing results based on only a few tens of independent single-molecule events, making this method extremely sensitive and statistically robust."
https://openalex.org/W2249589758,"Several pathogens have been described to enter host cells via cholesterol-enriched membrane lipid raft microdomains. We found that disruption of lipid rafts by the cholesterol-extracting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin or by the cholesterol-binding antifungal drug Amphotericin B strongly impairs the uptake of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans by human monocytes, suggesting a role of raft microdomains in the phagocytosis of the fungus. Time lapse confocal imaging indicated that Dectin-1, the C-type lectin receptor that recognizes Candida albicans cell wall-associated β-glucan, is recruited to lipid rafts upon Candida albicans uptake by monocytes, supporting the notion that lipid rafts act as an entry platform. Interestingly disruption of lipid raft integrity and interference with fungus uptake do not alter cytokine production by monocytes in response to Candida albicans but drastically dampen fungus specific T cell response. In conclusion, these data suggest that monocyte lipid rafts play a crucial role in the innate and adaptive immune responses to Candida albicans in humans and highlight a new and unexpected immunomodulatory function of the antifungal drug Amphotericin B."
https://openalex.org/W2261214572,"Previously, we compared the efficacy of nanoparticle (NP)-mediated intron-containing rhodopsin (sgRho) vs. intronless cDNA in ameliorating retinal disease phenotypes in a rhodopsin knockout (RKO) mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa. We showed that NP-mediated sgRho delivery achieved long-term expression and phenotypic improvement in RKO mice, but not NP housing cDNA. However, the protein level of the NP-sgRho construct was only 5–10% of wild-type at 8 mo postinjection. To have a better understanding of the reduced levels of long-term expression of the vectors, in the present study, we evaluated the epigenetic changes of subretinal delivering NP-cDNA vs. NP-sgRho in the RKO mouse eyes. Following the administration, DNA methylation and histone status of specific regions (bacteria plasmid backbone, promoter, rhodopsin gene, and scaffold/matrix attachment region) of the vectors were evaluated at various time points. We documented that epigenetic transgene silencing occurred in vector-mediated gene transfer, which were caused by the plasmid backbone and the cDNA of the transgene, but not the intron-containing transgene. No toxicity or inflammation was found in the treated eyes. Our results suggest that cDNA of the rhodopsin transgene and bacteria backbone interfered with the host defense mechanism of DNA methylation-mediated transgene silencing through heterochromatin-associated modifications.—Zheng, M., Mitra, R.

https://openalex.org/W2414179507,"Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is the end stage metabolite of tryptophan produced mainly by astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). It has neuroprotective activities but can be elevated in the neuropsychiatric disorders. Toxic effects of KYNA in the CNS are unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the subdural KYNA infusion on the spinal cord in adult rats.A total of 42 healthy adult rats were randomly assigned into six groups and were infused for 7 days with PBS (control) or 0.0002 pmol/min, 0.01 nmol/min, 0.1 nmol/min, 1 nmol/min, and 10 nmol/min of KYNA per 7 days. The effect of KYNA on spinal cord was determined using histological and electron microscopy examination. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) was measured in the blood serum to assess a degree of myelin damage.In all rats continuous long-lasting subdural KYNA infusion was associated with myelin damage and myelin loss that was increasingly widespread in a dose-depended fashion in peripheral, sub-pial areas. Damage to myelin sheaths was uniquely related to the separation of lamellae at the intraperiod line. The damaged myelin sheaths and areas with complete loss of myelin were associated with limited loss of scattered axons while vast majority of axons in affected areas were morphologically intact. The myelin loss-causing effect of KYNA occurred with no necrosis of oligodendrocytes, with locally severe astrogliosis and no cellular inflammatory response. Additionally, subdural KYNA infusion increased blood MOG concentration. Moreover, the rats infused with the highest doses of KYNA (1 and 10 nmol/min) demonstrated adverse neurological signs including weakness and quadriplegia.We suggest, that subdural infusion of high dose of KYNA can be used as an experimental tool for the study of mechanisms of myelin damage and regeneration. On the other hand, the administration of low, physiologically relevant doses of KYNA may help to discover the role of KYNA in control of physiological myelination process."

Also known as prostaglandin H synthases, these structurally homologous enzymes are expressed by distinct genes, resulting in differences in cellular localization and regulation. COX-1 and COX-2 use O2 to oxidize arachidonic acid (AA) as well as linoleic acid (LA), its dietary precursor, by Equations 1 and 2. COX-1 has a smaller active site, resulting in greater specificity for AA over LA than seen in the larger, more promiscuous COX-2 (4Tsai A.L. Kulmacz R.J. Prostaglandin H synthase: resolved and unresolved mechanistic issues.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 493: 103-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Each dioxygenase reaction starts with initial hydrogen abstraction (from AA or LA) by a catalytic tyrosyl radical. Antarafacial O2 trapping (of AA• or LA•) leads to a peroxyl radical that reoxidizes the catalytic tyrosine in a second hydrogen transfer step, thus propagating catalysis. The prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and acyclic hydroperoxide compounds (HPETEs and HPODEs) formed are processed by the enzyme's peroxidase activity, which consumes two reducing equivalents to generate prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) and acyclic hydroxylated compounds (hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs)) together with H2O. In vitro studies commonly use phenol as the reductant. Earlier work demonstrated simple, saturating behavior when phenol reacts with COX-2 (5Danish H.H. Doncheva I.S. Roth J.P.

AA and LA bind to COX-2 in similar L-shaped conformations (Fig. 1). The reactive bisallylic C–H bond is thereby positioned close to the catalytic tyrosyl radical (Tyr-371•) (7Vecchio A.J.

Prior to findings outlined here, small substrate kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) were reported to characterize dioxygenase catalysis by COX-1 and COX-2 (13Wu G. Lü J.M. van der Donk W.A. Kulmacz R.J.

Single turnover experiments with COX-1 indicated a deuterium KIE of ∼2 upon AA consumption that was indistinguishable from the deuterium KIE upon the steady-state bimolecular rate constant, Dkcat/Km(AA). This KIE is determined by steps beginning with AA association proceeding up to and including the first irreversible step. The results above, suggesting that initial hydrogen abstraction is the first irreversible step in COX-1, have been extended to COX-2 because of a similar Dkcat/Km(AA) of ∼2 extracted from state-state rate constants (4Tsai A.L.

Kinetic isotope effect of prostaglandin H synthase exhibits inverted temperature dependence.Catalysts. 2014; 4: 174-185Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This interpretation of the KIE makes it a challenge to explain the regio- and stereospecific reactivity of O2 during dioxygenase catalysis, leading to the hypothesis that distortion of the substrate radical causes accumulation of unpaired spin at a position accessible to O2 via a channel in the protein (16Smith W.L. Song I. The enzymology of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases-1 and -2.Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Since the works cited above, COX-1 and COX-2 have been reported to exhibit inverse deuterium KIEs and anomalous activation energies associated with Dkcat/Km(AA) as well as Dkcat. The latter has been proposed to reflect an inverse temperature dependence of the deuterium KIEs upon enzyme turnover at saturating concentrations of O2 (15Wu G. Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A.L. Kinetic isotope effect of prostaglandin H synthase exhibits inverted temperature dependence.Catalysts. 2014; 4: 174-185Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Such behavior might also arise from kinetic complexity due to competing steps with different temperature dependences instead of the reportedly lower thermal activation barrier to deuterium transfer than protium transfer (17Ludlow M.K. Soudackov A.V. Hammes-Schiffer S. Theoretical analysis of the unusual temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effect in quinol oxidation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 7094-7102Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present work, new data collected under physiologic conditions argue that a second hydrogen transfer, downstream of AA• or LA• formation and O2 trapping of the substrate radical, is the first irreversible step. In this reaction, the terminal peroxyl radical is reduced to the hydroperoxide product, and Tyr-371 is reoxidized to Tyr-371•. In the proposed mechanism, kinetic factors dictate regio- and stereospecific product formation during dioxygenase catalysis, a finding with implications for designing mechanism-based COX-2-specific inhibitors (18Marnett L.J.

Importantly, no differences were discernible with different preparations of the substrates containing variable levels of HPETE or HPODE impurities.

The following procedure was used to purify COX-2 proteins with all manipulations conducted at 4 °C unless noted. Cell pellets were suspended (1 g/4 ml) in a pH 7.4 buffer consisting of 25 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 1 mm PMSF prior to lysis. Next, sonication was performed using 50% amplitude and cycles of 10 s on and 60 s off. The lysate was isolated and centrifuged for 1 h at 43,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded, and the membrane fraction resuspended in the above lysis buffer supplemented with a 0.1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and Tween 20. The suspension was homogenized (Dounce), stirred on ice for 1.5 h, and then centrifuged for 1 h at 36,000 × g. The cell pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin pretreated with the lysis buffer for 90 min before loading onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (2-cm diameter, 10-ml bed volume). Chromatography utilized a pH 7.4 buffer containing 25 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, and 100 mm NaCl at a flow rate of approximately 0.65 ml/min. The ionic strength (μ) was raised using 300 mm NaCl prior to eluting the protein with 25 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, and 200 mm imidazole. Aliquots were removed and assayed for peroxidase activity. This procedure involved adding hematin, H2O2, and 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt to samples followed by colorimetric analysis of COX-2 peroxidase activity. Fractions with peroxidase activity were pooled, loaded onto a PD-10 desalting column (Bio-Rad), and eluted with 100 mm NaH2PO4 at pH 7.0 or 16 mm Na2H2P2O7 at pH 8.0 in the presence of 10% (v/v) glycerol and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, allowed isolation of imidazole-free solutions of COX-2 apoproteins lacking the Fe(III)(Por). Alternatively, apoproteins were purified by dialysis for >12 h against the pH 8.0 buffer above. COX-2 apoproteins were reconstituted at 20 °C. Two equivalents of hematin or Mn(III)(Por)Cl were incubated with solutions of homodimeric forms of COX-2 for 15–20 min. Hydrated DE53 resin was then added, and after 5 min, the mixture was loaded onto a second PD-10 column to remove any unbound metalloporphyrin. The holoprotein was eluted with 100 mm NaH2PO4 buffered to pH 7.0 or 16 mm Na2H2P2O7 buffered to pH 8.0, each containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20. Solutions of holoprotein were concentrated to ≤5 ml using an Amicon stirred cell equipped with a 30-kDa ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore), apportioned into 50–100-μl aliquots, and stored at −80 or −30 °C inside the freezer of the N2-filled glove box described above. Protein samples were characterized by amino acid analysis (Texas A&M), polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electronic absorption using a diode array spectrophotometer (HP8453a). The extinction coefficient for apo COX-2 (ϵ278 nm = 116,000 m−1 cm−1) (21Goodwin D.C. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. Substitution of tyrosine for the proximal histidine ligand to the heme of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2: implications for the mechanism of cyclooxygenase activation and catalysis.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5422-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was used to compute extinction coefficients associated with the Soret bands of Fe(III)(Por)- and Mn(III)(Por)-bound COX-2 proteins, which ranged from ϵ407 nm = 129,000 m−1 cm− to ϵ375 nm = 66,000 m−1 cm− and ϵ470 nm = 42,000 m−1 cm−, respectively. The concentration of active COX-2 was analyzed using extinction coefficients calculated as outlined above and a standard assay conducted at 30.0 ± 0.2 °C. Standard assay buffers contained kinetically saturating concentrations (>6 Km) of the following dioxygenase and peroxidase substrates: [AA] or [LA] = 50–100 μm, [O2] = 237 μm (from air), and [phenol] = >1.5 mm. Hematin or Mn(III)(Por) was added (1 μm) to prevent significant dissociation of the prosthetic group from the holoprotein. Initial rates were measured with an O2 electrode (YSI model 5300A) and compared with predetermined kcat values. As expected, Y371F COX-2 showed no activity due to the absence of Tyr-371•, whereas WT and Y334F COX-2 showed comparable kcat values (22Rogge C.E. Ho B. Liu W. Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A.L. Role of Tyr348 in Tyr385 radical dynamics and cyclooxygenase inhibitor interactions in prostaglandin H synthase-2.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Ascertaining the concentration of active enzyme is critical to the investigation of rate constants and deuterium KIEs at variable temperatures. In such experiments, changes in protein structure might result in loss of activity. Therefore, enzyme concentrations were checked by preincubating aliquots of stock solution at reaction temperatures between 5.0 and 50.0 °C for 3 min before performing standard assays. Under these conditions, no decrease in enzyme activity was detectable, and no correction for enzyme concentration was applied. Initial rates were measured at 30.0 ± 0.2 °C unless noted using the O2 electrode (above). All experiments were conducted at pH 8.0 in 0.016 mm sodium pyrophosphate (μ = 0.1 m) using known concentrations of AA or LA and O2 along with optimized concentrations of phenol, hydroperoxide initiator, and 1 μm hematin or Mn(III)(Por)Cl. Kinetic measurements were initiated by injecting 1–10 μl of enzyme stock solution into 1.0–1.5 ml of stirring reaction solution contained inside a chamber with no headspace. Standard assays were used to check for changes in enzyme concentration over the course of experiments. Diminution in dioxygenase activity is clearly detected as COX-2 undergoes turnover. However, initial rates extracted from the most linear portion of the reaction progress curve after allowing ∼5 s for mixing varied in proportion to the enzyme concentration. This behavior is consistent with no significant loss of enzyme activity on the experimental time scale. In some cases, correction to the O2 uptake rate for background drift of the YSI electrode was required. In no instance was this correction >30% of the measured rate. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting data to the hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten equation: V/[E] = kcat[S]/(Km + [S]) using Kaleidagraph 4.0 (Synergy Software). The concentration of fatty acid or O2, [S], was varied, whereas the co-substrate concentration was held fixed at kinetic saturation; i.e. >6 Km. The apparent maximal rate (Vmax) divided by the active enzyme concentration, [E], plotted versus [S] gave a hyperbolic trend that was fitted to obtain the unimolecular rate constant kcat and bimolecular rate constants kcat/Km(LA) or kcat/Km(AA) and kcat/Km(O2). Bimolecular rate constants were also extracted by linear fitting of data at concentrations below ½Km(S). Studies of temperature-dependent kinetics at high and low [O2] were performed using protiated and deuterated substrates. The resulting substrate deuterium KIEs upon kcat and kcat/Km(O2) were determined over a 5.0 or 10.0 to 50.0 °C range. Data were analyzed by linear regression of natural log versus inverse temperature plots assuming the phenomenological Arrhenius expression: kcat or kcat/Km(O2) = A exp(−Ea/RT). Experiments were carried out to probe for diffusion-limited contributions to kcat/Km(O2) in accord with the Stokes-Einstein relation (23Edward J.T. Molecular volumes and the Stokes-Einstein equation.J. Chem. Educ. 1970; 47: 261Crossref Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). Initial rates were examined at varying [O2] while [AA] or [LA] was held constant at 50–100 μm (>6 Km) in the presence of sucrose or polyethylene glycol, which served as micro- and macroviscosogens, respectively. An Ostwald viscometer allowed the relative viscosity, η/η0, to be measured and correlated to kcat/Km(O2) as a means of probing for diffusion-controlled steps (24Hasinoff B.B. Chishti S.B. Viscosity dependence of the kinetics of the diffusion-controlled reaction of carbon monoxide and myoglobin.Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4275-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Brouwer A.C. Kirsch J.F. Investigation of diffusion-limited rates of chymotrypsin reactions by viscosity variation.Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1302-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The effect of added micro- or macroviscosogen was examined up to η/η0 = 4 to test whether O2-trapping of AA• or LA• and hydroperoxide product release steps contribute to kcat/Km(O2). Products of AA and LA oxidation were quantified in relation to the O2 consumed to confirm the reaction stoichiometries of Equations 1 and 2. Experiments were carried out by adding enzymes to 3–10-ml reaction solutions. After monitoring O2 uptake, 1 ml of acetic acid was added to quench the reaction. Acidification also neutralized the fatty acid oxidation products, allowing for extraction into CH2Cl2. Although COX-2 possesses peroxidase activity, 5% (v/v) trimethyl phosphite was added to ensure reduction of hydroperoxide products; i.e. PGG2 was converted to PGH2, HPETEs were converted to HETEs, and HPODEs were converted to HODEs (26Lewis E.R. Johansen E. Holman T.R. Large competitive kinetic isotope effects in human 15-lipoxygenase catalysis measured by a novel HPLC method.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1395-1396Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Solutions of these compounds were evaporated to a residue under a stream of N2 and then redissolved in a known volume of methanol. Samples were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) on a Waters Acquity/Xevo-G2 system equipped with a reverse phase C18 column (HSS T3 1.8 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm) and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer operating in negative ion mode. The mobile phase (60% acetonitrile and 40% water), flowing at a rate of 0.5 ml/min, allowed separation of products, which were identified based on comparisons with authentic samples. Apparent deuterium KIE upon LA oxidation, ap Dkcat/Km(LA), was measured competitively in 100 μm solutions of perprotiated (h31-LA) and perdeuterated (d31-LA) fatty acid combined in a 1:3 ratio. Experiments were performed with WT and Y334F COX-2 over a range of O2 concentrations by analyzing the ratio of deuterated to protiated products at low conversion (≤10%) relative to 100% conversion. The latter measurements used excess COX-2 or soybean lipoxygenase (26Lewis E.R. Johansen E. Holman T.R. Large competitive kinetic isotope effects in human 15-lipoxygenase catalysis measured by a novel HPLC method.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1395-1396Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Following the protocol above, UPLC-MS exposed two baseline resolved signals corresponding to the monodeprotonated isomers of h31-HODE and d31-HODE. This ratio was corroborated by analysis of electronic absorption at 235 nm, the wavelength of maximum absorption associated with the conjugated diene in the product. Experiments were undertaken to test whether the reactive hydrogen of the substrate undergoes exchange with the solvent in the presence and absence of Tyr-371•-containing COX-2. WT, Y334F, and Y371F proteins were incubated anaerobically in 3–10 ml of N2-saturated pH 8 buffered H2O containing 50 μm d31-LA. HPODEs in this substrate were present at trace levels sufficient to ensure full enzyme activation. 2 mm phenol was also added to protect enzymes from overoxidation by HPODEs. Samples were incubated at 4 °C under N2 for 12 h before reisolation of unreacted d31-LA. The procedure used was analogous to that described in under “Product Analysis.” Acid-quenched samples were extracted with CH2Cl2, evaporated to a residue, redissolved in methanol, and then analyzed by UPLC-MS. A sample containing all components but no protein was analyzed as a second type of control for detecting spurious isotope exchange. Recently, Danish et al. (5Danish H.H. Doncheva I.S. Roth J.P. Hydrogen tunneling steps in cyclooxygenase-2 catalysis.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 15846-15849Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the dioxygenase activity of COX-2 could be analyzed independently of the peroxidase activity of the enzyme at sufficiently high concentrations of phenol. Such investigations are not possible with COX-1 where rate acceleration is followed by inhibition upon adding phenol (6Mukherjee A. Brinkley D.W. Chang K.M. Roth J.P. Molecular oxygen dependent steps in fatty acid oxidation by cyclooxygenase-1.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3975-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, rates of dioxygenase catalysis were found to saturate hyperbolically upon increasing the phenol concentration to 1.0–3.0 mm with Fe(III)(Por)-containing WT COX-2 and Y334F COX-2. With these enzymes, trace hydroperoxide impurities present in AA or LA were sufficient to observe optimal rates of turnover. The lower peroxidase activity of Mn(III)(Por)-WT COX-2 eliminates the requirement of added phenol. Even in the presence of 3–10 μm HPODE or HPETE needed to optimize initial rates, no phenol dependence was detected. Furthermore, the inhibition of dioxygenase activity by phenol was undetected in all forms of COX-2 examined in this study. Steady-state rate constants for LA oxidation were determined for WT COX-2 and the Y334F variant, which lacks a conserved hydrogen bond to Tyr-371• or Tyr-371 (7Vecchio A.J. Simmons D.M.

Methods A sentence-picture matching task with canonical and non-canonical spoken sentences was performed using concurrent eye tracking. Accuracy, reaction time, and eye tracking data (fixations) of 50 healthy subjects and 12 aphasic patients were analysed. Results Patients showed increased error rates and reaction times, as well as delayed fixation preferences for target pictures in non-canonical sentences. Patients’ fixation patterns differed from healthy controls and revealed deficits in recognizing and immediately integrating morphosyntactic cues. Conclusion Our study corroborates the notion that difficulties in understanding syntactically complex sentences are attributable to a processing deficit encompassing delayed and therefore impaired recognition and integration of cues, as well as increased competition between interpretations."
https://openalex.org/W2103350404,This report is the first characterization of the histology and ultrastructure of the barred owl conjunctiva. The inferior eyelid was dominated by a large disk-shaped plate covered by a non-keratinized stratified squamous or cuboidal epithelium of variable thickness. The apical surface of the plate epithelium varied from flat to long microvilli or even short cytoplasmic extensions similar to those seen in the third eyelid. All specimens had a few goblet cells filled with mucous secretory granules in the plate region. The underlying connective tissue was a dense fibroelastic stroma. Eosinophils were surprisingly common in the epithelial layer and underlying connective tissue in the plate and more distal orbital mucosal region. The orbital mucosa contained goblet cells with heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The leading edge and marginal plait of the third eyelid are designed to collect fluid and particulate matter as they sweep across the surface of the eye. The palpebral conjunctival surface of the third eyelid was covered by an approximately five-cell-deep stratified squamous epithelium without goblet cells. The bulbar surface of the third eyelid was a bilayer of epithelial cells whose superficial cells have elaborate cytoplasmic tapering extensions reaching out 25 μm. Narrow cytofilia radiated outwards up to an additional 15-20 μm from the cytoplasmic extensions. Lectin labeling demonstrated heterogeneous glycosylation of the apical membrane specializations but only small amounts of glycoprotein-filled secretory granules in the third eyelid.
https://openalex.org/W2176868636,"The international response to Haiti's ongoing cholera outbreak has been multifaceted, including health education efforts by community health workers and the distribution of free water treatment products. Artibonite Department was the first region affected by the outbreak. Numerous organizations have been involved in cholera response efforts in Haiti with many focusing on efforts to improve water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Multiple types of water treatment products have been distributed, creating the potential for confusion over correct dosage and water treatment methods. We utilized qualitative methods in Artibonite to determine the population's response to WASH messages, use and acceptability of water treatment products, and water treatment and sanitation knowledge, attitudes and practices at the household level. We conducted eighteen focus group discussions (FGDs): 17 FGDs were held with community members (nine among females, eight among males); one FGD was held with community health workers. Health messages related to WASH were well-retained, with reported improvements in hand-washing. Community health workers were identified as valued sources of health information. Most participants noted a paucity of water-treatment products. Sanitation, specifically the construction of latrines, was the most commonly identified need. Lack of funds was the primary reason given for not constructing a latrine. The construction and maintenance of potable water and sanitation services is needed to ensure a sustainable change."
https://openalex.org/W2177166454,"Background We have previously reported that high glucose impairs coronary vasodilation by reducing voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel activity. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are potent factors that contribute to the development of diabetic vasculopathy. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of AGEs in high glucose-induced impairment of Kv channels-mediated coronary vasodilation. Methods Patch-clamp recording and molecular biological techniques were used to assess the function and expression of Kv channels. Vasodilation of isolated rat small coronary arteries was measured using a pressurized myograph. Treatment of isolated coronary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats with aminoguanidine, the chemical inhibitor of AGEs formation, was performed to determine the contribution of AGEs. Results Incubation of VSMCs with high glucose reduced Kv current density by 60.4 ± 4.8%, and decreased expression of Kv1.2 and Kv1.5 both at the gene and protein level, whereas inhibiting AGEs formation or blocking AGEs interacting with their receptors prevented high glucose-induced impairment of Kv channels. In addition, diabetic rats manifested reduced Kv channels-mediated coronary dilation (9.3 ± 1.4% vs. 36.9 ± 1.4%, P < 0.05), which was partly corrected by the treatment with aminoguanidine (24.4 ± 2.2% vs. 9.3 ± 1.4%, P < 0.05). Conclusions Excessive formation of AGEs impairs Kv channels in VSMCs, then leading to attenuation of Kv channels-mediated coronary vasodilation."
https://openalex.org/W2285779071,"Introduction Social network analysis has emerged as a promising tool in modern social psychology. This method can be used to examine friend-based social relationships in terms of network theory, with nodes representing individual students and ties representing relationships between students (e.g., friendships and kinships). Using social network analysis, we investigated whether greater severity of ADHD symptoms is correlated with weaker peer relationships among elementary school students. Methods A total of 562 sixth-graders from two elementary schools (300 males) provided the names of their best friends (maximum 10 names). Their teachers rated each student’s ADHD symptoms using an ADHD rating scale. Results The results showed that 10.2% of the students were at high risk for ADHD. Significant group differences were observed between the high-risk students and other students in two of the three network parameters (degree, centrality and closeness) used to assess friendship quality, with the high-risk group showing significantly lower values of degree and closeness compared to the other students. Moreover, negative correlations were found between the ADHD rating and two social network analysis parameters. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the severity of ADHD symptoms is strongly correlated with the quality of social and interpersonal relationships in students with ADHD symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2176328584,"Aims There seems to be two distinct patterns in the presentation of acute heart failure (AHF) patients; early- vs. gradual-onset. However, whether time-dependent relationship exists in outcomes of patients with AHF remains unclear. Methods The Tokyo Cardiac Care Unit Network Database prospectively collects information of emergency admissions via EMS service to acute cardiac care facilities from 67 participating hospitals in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Between 2009 and 2011, a total of 3811 AHF patients were registered. The documentation of symptom onset time was mandated by the on-site ambulance team. We divided the patients into two groups according to the median onset-to-hospitalization (OH) time for those patients (2h); early- (presenting ≤2h after symptom onset) vs. gradual-onset (late) group (>2h). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results The early OH group had more urgent presentation, as demonstrated by a higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate, and higher incidence of pulmonary congestion (48.6% vs. 41.6%; P<0.001); whereas medical comorbidities such as stroke (10.8% vs. 7.9%; P<0.001) and atrial fibrillation (30.0% vs. 26.0%; P<0.001) were more frequently seen in the late OH group. Overall, 242 (6.5%) patients died during hospitalization. Notably, a shorter OH time was associated with a better in-hospital mortality rate (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.51−0.99; P = 0.043). Conclusions Early-onset patients had rather typical AHF presentations (e.g., higher SBP or pulmonary congestion) but had a better in-hospital outcome compared to gradual-onset patients."

https://openalex.org/W2173519990,"Many human infectious diseases are caused by pathogens that have multiple strains and show oscillation in infection incidence and alternation of dominant strains which together are referred to as epidemic cycling. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of epidemic cycling is essential for forecasting outbreaks of epidemics and therefore important for public health planning. Current theoretical effort is mainly focused on the factors that are extrinsic to the pathogens themselves (""extrinsic factors"") such as environmental variation and seasonal change in human behaviours and susceptibility. Nevertheless, co-circulation of different strains of a pathogen was usually observed and thus strains interact with one another within concurrent infection and during sequential infection. The existence of these intrinsic factors is common and may be involved in the generation of epidemic cycling of multi-strain pathogens.To explore the mechanisms that are intrinsic to the pathogens themselves (""intrinsic factors"") for epidemic cycling, we consider a multi-strain SIRS model including cross-immunity and infectivity enhancement and use seasonal influenza as an example to parameterize the model. The Kullback-Leibler information distance was calculated to measure the match between the model outputs and the typical features of seasonal flu (an outbreak duration of 11 weeks and an annual attack rate of 15%). Results show that interactions among strains can generate seasonal influenza with these characteristic features, provided that: the infectivity of a single strain within concurrent infection is enhanced 2-7 times that within a single infection; cross-immunity as a result of past infection is 0.5-0.8 and lasts 2-9 years; while other parameters are within their widely accepted ranges (such as a 2-3 day infectious period and the basic reproductive number of 1.8-3.0). Moreover, the observed alternation of the dominant strain among epidemics emerges naturally from the best fit model. Alternative modelling that also includes seasonal forcing in transmissibility shows that both external mechanisms (i.e. seasonal forcing) and the intrinsic mechanisms (i.e., strain interactions) are equally able to generate the observed time-series in seasonal flu.The intrinsic mechanism of strain interactions alone can generate the observed patterns of seasonal flu epidemics, but according to Kullback-Leibler information distance the importance of extrinsic mechanisms cannot be excluded. The intrinsic mechanism illustrated here to explain seasonal flu may also apply to other infectious diseases caused by polymorphic pathogens."

We previously observed nuclear accumulation of Ser-552 phosphorylated β-catenin (pβ-Cat(Ser-552)) in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) during colitis and colitis-associated cancer. Data here delineate a novel multiprotein cytosolic complex (MCC) involved in β-catenin signaling in the intestine. The MCC contains p85α, the class IA subunit of PI3K, along with β-catenin, 14-3-3ζ, Akt, and p110α. MCC levels in IEC increase in colitis and colitis-associated cancer patients. IEC-specific p85α-deficient (p85(ΔIEC)) mice develop more severe dextran sodium sulfate colitis due to delayed ulcer healing and reduced epithelial β-catenin activation. In colonic IEC, p85α deficiency did not alter PI3K signaling. In vitro shRNA depletion of individual complex members disrupts the MCC and reduces β-catenin signaling. Despite worse colitis, p85(ΔIEC) mice have reduced tumor burden after azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate treatment. Together the data indicate that the β-catenin MCC is needed for mucosal repair and carcinogenesis. This novel MCC may be an attractive therapeutic target in preventing cancer in colitis patients."

This study investigated the prognostic role of adjuvant chemotherapy in Korean patients with node-negative (N0), triple-negative (TN) MBC patients. Methods We included data from 252 patients with N0 TN MBC, obtained from the Korean Breast Cancer Registry database. Patients were categorized as those who did not undergo adjuvant chemotherapy (group I) or those who did (group II). Clinicopathological characteristics, breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), and overall survival (OS) were compared between the groups. In addition, a subgroup analysis for survival based on tumor size was conducted. Results A total of 252 N0 TN MBC patients with tumor sizes >1 cm who were diagnosed between April 1997 and March 2011 were enrolled. The median age was 44.95 years (range, 25–72 years), and the median follow-up period was 93.94 months (range, 23–195 months). Overall, the BCSS and OS in group II (97.3% and 97.3%, respectively) were significantly better compared with those in group I (89.2% and 86.2%, respectively). In the subgroup analysis, in patients with tumors >2 cm in size, those in group II had significant better BCSS and OS (97.5% and 97.5%, respectively) compared with those in group I (78.3% and 73.9%, respectively). In contrast in those with tumors 1–2 cm in size, there were no significant differences in BCSS and OS between the groups (both 97.1% for group I, and 95.2% and 92.9%, respectively for group II). Multivariate analysis revealed that adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved BCSS (P = 0.009) and OS (P = 0.007), but only for patients with larger tumors (>2 cm). Conclusions In patients with N0 TN MBC, adjuvant chemotherapy had a significant clinical survival benefit, but only in those with tumors >2 cm."
https://openalex.org/W2173675283,"Fragmentary post-cranial remains (femora, tibia, vertebrae) of ornithischian dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous of the Sultanate of Oman are described and referred to hadrosauroids. The specimens come from the Al-Khod Conglomerate, of latest Campanian to Maastrichtian age, in the north-eastern part of the country. Although the fragmentary condition of the fossils precludes a precise identification, various characters, including the shape of the fourth trochanter of the femur and the morphology of its distal end, support an attribution to hadrosauroids. With the possible exception of a possible phalanx from Angola, this group of ornithopod dinosaurs, which apparently originated in Laurasia, was hitherto unreported from the Afro-Arabian plate. From a paleobiogeographical point of view, the presence of hadrosauroids in Oman in all likelihood is a result of trans-Tethys dispersal from Asia or Europe, probably by way of islands in the Tethys shown on all recent paleogeographical maps of that area. Whether hadrosauroids were widespread on the Afro-Arabian landmass in the latest Cretaceous, or where restricted to the « Oman island » shown on some paleogeographical maps, remains to be determined."

People with high levels of chronic ego depletion were less successful in goal adherence than those with less chronic ego depletion. Although daily effort devoted to goal adherence increased with chronic ego depletion, motivation to adhere to goals was not affected. Participants with high levels of chronic ego depletion showed a stronger positive association between mental effort and performance, but chronic ego depletion did not play a regulatory role in the effect of motivation on performance. Chronic ego depletion increased the likelihood of behavior regulation failure, suggesting that it is difficult for people in an ego-depletion state to adhere to goals. We integrate our results with the findings of previous studies and discuss possible theoretical implications."

To assess the structure and function of Hsp90α and its potential regulation by post-translational modification, we developed a combined knockdown and rescue assay in zebrafish embryos to systematically analyze the effects of various mutations on Hsp90α function in myosin thick filament organization. DNA constructs expressing the Hsp90α1 mutants with altered putative ATP binding, phosphorylation, acetylation or methylation sites were co-injected with Hsp90α1 specific morpholino into zebrafish embryos. Myosin thick filament organization was analyzed in skeletal muscles of the injected embryos by immunostaining. The results showed that mutating the conserved D90 residue in the Hsp90α1 ATP binding domain abolished its function in thick filament organization. In addition, phosphorylation mimicking mutations of T33D, T33E and T87E compromised Hsp90α1 function in myosin thick filament organization. Similarly, K287Q acetylation mimicking mutation repressed Hsp90α1 function in myosin thick filament organization. In contrast, K206R and K608R hypomethylation mimicking mutations had not effect on Hsp90α1 function in thick filament organization. Given that T33 and T87 are highly conserved residues involved post-translational modification (PTM) in yeast, mouse and human Hsp90 proteins, data from this study could indicate that Hsp90α1 function in myosin thick filament organization is potentially regulated by PTMs involving phosphorylation and acetylation."
