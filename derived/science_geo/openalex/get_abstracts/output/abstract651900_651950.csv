https://openalex.org/W3023742764,"We examined the association between the consumption of ultra-processed foods and adiposity in a nationally representative sample of the UK adult population. We studied 6,143 participants (19 to 96 years, 51.6% female) sampled by the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2008-16). Food items reported in four-day food diary were classified according to the NOVA system. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations between the dietary contribution of ultra-processed foods (sex-specific quartile and continuous) and Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference (WC) and obesity (BMI>30kg/m2) and abdominal obesity (men: WC≥102cm, women: WC≥88cm) status. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. In multivariable analyses, the highest consumption of ultra-processed food was associated with 1.66 kg/m2 higher BMI (95%CI 0.96-2.36), 3.56 cm greater WC (95%CI 1.79-5.33) and 90% higher odds for being obese (OR = 1.90, 95%CI 1.39-2.61), compared with the lowest consumption. A 10% increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with an increase of 0.38 kg/m2 in BMI (95%CI 0.20-0.55), 0.87 cm in WC (95%CI 0.40-1.33) and 18% higher odds of being obese (OR = 1.18, 95%CI 1.08-1.28). The consumption of ultra-processed food was associated with an increase in BMI, WC and prevalence of obesity in both sexes. A dose response relationship was observed in both sexes, with a 10% increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods being associated with a 18% increase in the prevalence of obesity in men and a 17% increase in women. Higher consumption of ultra-processed food is associated with greater adiposity in the UK adult population. Policy makers should consider actions that promote consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods and reduce consumption of ultra-processed foods."

Here the drought-induced response of maize was modulated by applications of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salicylic acid (SA) to seeds prior to sowing and to leaves prior to stress treatment. Pot experiments were conducted to ascertain the effects of exogenous applications of these hormones on maize growth, physiology and biochemistry under drought stress and well-watered (control) conditions. Maize plants were subjected to single as well as combined pre-treatments of MeJA and SA. Drought stress severely affected maize morphology and reduced relative water content, above and below-ground biomass, rates of photosynthesis, and protein content. The prolonged water deficit also led to increased relative membrane permeability and oxidative stress induced by the production of malondialdehyde (from lipid peroxidation), lipoxygenase activity (LOX) and the production of H2O2. The single applications of MeJA and SA were not found to be effective in maize for drought tolerance while the combined pre-treatments with exogenous MeJA+SA mitigated the adverse effects of drought-induced oxidative stress, as reflected in lower levels of lipid peroxidation, LOX activity and H2O2. The same pre-treatment also maintained adequate water status of the plants under drought stress by increasing osmolytes including proline, total carbohydrate content and total soluble sugars. Furthermore, exogenous applications of MeJA+SA approximately doubled the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. Pre-treatment with MeJA alone gave the highest increase in drought-induced production of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA). Pre-treatment with MeJA+SA partially prevented drought-induced oxidative stress by modulating levels of osmolytes and endogenous ABA, as well as the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Taken together, the results show that seed and foliar pre-treatments with exogenous MeJA and/or SA can have positive effects on the responses of maize seedlings to drought."
https://openalex.org/W3021743785,"Text classification (TC) is the task of automatically assigning documents to a fixed number of categories. TC is an important component in many text applications. Many of these applications perform preprocessing. There are different types of text preprocessing, e.g., conversion of uppercase letters into lowercase letters, HTML tag removal, stopword removal, punctuation mark removal, lemmatization, correction of common misspelled words, and reduction of replicated characters. We hypothesize that the application of different combinations of preprocessing methods can improve TC results. Therefore, we performed an extensive and systematic set of TC experiments (and this is our main research contribution) to explore the impact of all possible combinations of five/six basic preprocessing methods on four benchmark text corpora (and not samples of them) using three ML methods and training and test sets. The general conclusion (at least for the datasets verified) is that it is always advisable to perform an extensive and systematic variety of preprocessing methods combined with TC experiments because it contributes to improve TC accuracy. For all the tested datasets, there was always at least one combination of basic preprocessing methods that could be recommended to significantly improve the TC using a BOW representation. For three datasets, stopword removal was the only single preprocessing method that enabled a significant improvement compared to the baseline result using a bag of 1,000-word unigrams. For some of the datasets, there was minimal improvement when we removed HTML tags, performed spelling correction or removed punctuation marks, and reduced replicated characters. However, for the fourth dataset, the stopword removal was not beneficial. Instead, the conversion of uppercase letters into lowercase letters was the only single preprocessing method that demonstrated a significant improvement compared to the baseline result. The best result for this dataset was obtained when we performed spelling correction and conversion into lowercase letters. In general, for all the datasets processed, there was always at least one combination of basic preprocessing methods that could be recommended to improve the accuracy results when using a bag-of-words representation."
https://openalex.org/W3021326959,"Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is a key component of NO–cGMP signaling in mammals. Although heme must bind in the sGC β1 subunit (sGCβ) for sGC to function, how heme is delivered to sGCβ remains unknown. Given that GAPDH displays properties of a heme chaperone for inducible NO synthase, here we investigated whether heme delivery to apo-sGCβ involves GAPDH. We utilized an sGCβ reporter construct, tetra-Cys sGCβ, whose heme insertion can be followed by fluorescence quenching in live cells, assessed how lowering cell GAPDH expression impacts heme delivery, and examined whether expressing WT GAPDH or a GAPDH variant defective in heme binding recovers heme delivery. We also studied interaction between GAPDH and sGCβ in cells and their complex formation and potential heme transfer using purified proteins. We found that heme delivery to apo-sGCβ correlates with cellular GAPDH expression levels and depends on the ability of GAPDH to bind intracellular heme, that apo-sGCβ associates with GAPDH in cells and dissociates when heme binds sGCβ, and that the purified GAPDH–heme complex binds to apo-sGCβ and transfers its heme to sGCβ. On the basis of these results, we propose a model where GAPDH obtains mitochondrial heme and then forms a complex with apo-sGCβ to accomplish heme delivery to sGCβ. Our findings illuminate a critical step in sGC maturation and uncover an additional mechanism that regulates its activity in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3022360785,"Inflammation plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Chinese medicinal herbs, has been widely used to treat various diseases, including liver diseases for hundreds of years. The previous studies have shown that BBR inhibits high fat-diet-induced steatosis and inflammation in rodent models of NAFLD. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study is aimed to identify the potential mechanisms by which BBR inhibits free fatty acid (FFA) and LPS-induced inflammatory response in mouse macrophages and hepatocytes. Mouse RAW264.7 macrophages and primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with palmitic acid (PA) or LPS or both with or without BBR (0-10 μM) for different periods (0-24 h). The mRNA and protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, MCP-1) and ER stress genes (CHOP, ATF4, XBP-1) were detected by real-time RT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA, respectively. The results indicated that BBR significantly inhibited PA and LPS-induced activation of ER stress and expression of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages and hepatocytes. PA/LPS-mediated activation of ERK1/2 was inhibited by BBR in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, BBR inhibits PA/LPS-induced inflammatory responses through modulating ER stress-mediated ERK1/2 activation in macrophages and hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3021137054,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a therapeutic challenge because of its intrinsic and extrinsic chemoresistance mechanisms. Here, we report that C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and hedgehog pathways cooperate in PC chemoresistance via bidirectional tumor-stromal crosstalk. We show that when PC cells are co-cultured with pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) they are significantly more resistant to gemcitabine toxicity than those grown in monoculture. We also demonstrate that this co-culture-induced chemoresistance is abrogated by inhibition of the CXCR4 and hedgehog pathways. Similarly, the co-culture-induced altered expression of genes in PC cells associated with gemcitabine metabolism, antioxidant defense, and cancer stemness is also reversed upon CXCR4 and hedgehog inhibition. We have confirmed the functional impact of these genetic alterations by measuring gemcitabine metabolites, reactive oxygen species production, and sphere formation in vehicle- or gemcitabine-treated monocultures and co-cultured PC cells. Treatment of orthotopic pancreatic tumor-bearing mice with gemcitabine alone or in combination with a CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100) or hedgehog inhibitor (GDC-0449) displays reduced tumor growth. Notably, we show that the triple combination treatment is the most effective, resulting in nearly complete suppression of tumor growth. Immunohistochemical analysis of Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 confirm these findings from in vivo imaging and tumor measurements. Our findings provide preclinical and mechanistic evidence that a combination of gemcitabine treatment with targeted inhibition of both the CXCR4 and hedgehog pathways improves outcomes in a PC mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W3021407893,"Lymphatic systems play important roles in the maintenance of fluid homeostasis and undergo anatomical and physiological changes during inflammation and aging. While lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) undergo mesenchymal transition in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) of LECs remain largely unknown. In this study, we examined the effect of TGF-β2 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), an inflammatory cytokine, on EndMT using human skin-derived lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs). TGF-β2-treated HDLECs showed increased expression of SM22α, a mesenchymal cell marker accompanied by increased cell motility and vascular permeability, suggesting HDLECs to undergo EndMT. Our data also revealed that TNF-α could enhance TGF-β2-induced EndMT of HDLECs. Furthermore, both cytokines induced the production of Activin A while decreasing the expression of its inhibitory molecule Follistatin, and thus enhancing EndMT. Finally, we demonstrated that human dermal lymphatic vessels underwent EndMT during aging, characterized by double immunostaining for LYVE1 and SM22α. These results suggest that both TGF-β and TNF-α signals play a central role in EndMT of LECs and could be potential targets for senile edema."
https://openalex.org/W3022181360,"Vesicles that are coated by coat protein complex II (COPII) are the primary mediators of vesicular traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Secretion-associated Ras-related GTPase 1 (SAR1) is a small GTPase that is part of COPII and, upon GTP binding, recruits the other COPII proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Mammals have two SAR1 paralogs that genetic data suggest may have distinct physiological roles, e.g. in lipoprotein secretion in the case of SAR1B. Here we identified two amino acid clusters that have conserved SAR1 paralog–specific sequences. We observed that one cluster is adjacent to the SAR1 GTP-binding pocket and alters the kinetics of GTP exchange. The other cluster is adjacent to the binding site for two COPII components, SEC31 homolog A COPII coat complex component (SEC31) and SEC23. We found that the latter cluster confers to SAR1B a binding preference for SEC23A that is stronger than that of SAR1A for SEC23A. Unlike SAR1B, SAR1A was prone to oligomerize on a membrane surface. SAR1B knockdown caused loss of lipoprotein secretion, overexpression of SAR1B but not of SAR1A could restore secretion, and a divergent cluster adjacent to the SEC31/SEC23-binding site was critical for this SAR1B function. These results highlight that small primary sequence differences between the two mammalian SAR1 paralogs lead to pronounced biochemical differences that significantly affect COPII assembly and identify a specific function for SAR1B in lipoprotein secretion, providing insights into the mechanisms of large cargo secretion that may be relevant for COPII-related diseases.

ER-to-Golgi protein trafficking is a key checkpoint in sorting of proteins for secretion. Approximately one-third of all proteins are first assembled in the ER and then sorted to other destinations by COPII. Of the five core COPII proteins, the first to arrive at the ER membrane is SAR1. SAR1 is a small GTPase with an amphipathic helix that inserts into the membrane when SAR1 is in the GTP-bound state. SAR1 then recruits the remainder of the COPII complex, SEC23/24 and SEC13/31 heterodimers, to the ER membrane (1Hicke L. Schekman R.

It is thought that regulation of the GTPase activity of SAR1 is important for large cargo selection (6Saito K. Maeda M. Katada T. Regulation of the Sar1 GTPase cycle is necessary for large cargo secretion from the endoplasmic reticulum.Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 5 (28879181): 7510.3389/fcell.2017.00075Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, SAR1 has two important roles: recruitment of the other COPII proteins and controlling the timing of COPII budding with its GTPase cycle. Given its essential nature, it is perhaps not surprising that SAR1 is extremely well conserved throughout evolution. The protein sequence of yeast and human SAR1 is either identical or strongly similar for ∼80% of the amino acid sequence, despite the fact that humans have greatly different secretory requirements from yeast. One area of divergence is that many invertebrates have only one paralog of SAR1, whereas mammals and most vertebrates have two. It is possible that these two paralogs have evolved unique functions to compensate for the diverse secretory needs of different cell types. Genetic data provide some evidence that the two SAR1 paralogs, SAR1A and SAR1B, have divergent roles. For example, loss of SAR1B leads to chylomicron retention disease/Anderson's disease, which results in inability to transport newly synthesized chylomicrons out of intestinal epithelial cells (7Charcosset M.

Both SAR1 paralogs are highly expressed in the intestine, and SAR1A expression increases in chylomicron retention disease/Anderson's disease patients, but this increase is insufficient to compensate for loss of SAR1B (8Georges A. Bonneau J. Bonnefont-Rousselot D. Champigneulle J. Rabès J.P. Abifadel M. Aparicio T. Guenedet J.C. Bruckert E. Boileau C. Morali A. Varret M. Aggerbeck L.P. Samson-Bouma M.E.

Taken together, these data suggest that the SAR1 paralogs have overlapping and unique functions in cells and likely differ biochemically; however, little is known about the biochemical differences between SAR1A and SAR1B. Here we identify two divergent clusters of conserved sequence differences between the two SAR1 paralogs. We find that a GTP-adjacent cluster alters GTP loading activity and direct interactions with SEC31A. We find that a second cluster in an apical α-helix causes SAR1B to bind more efficiently to SEC23 and SAR1A to homodimerize. We find that the apical α-helix is necessary and sufficient for more efficient rescue of lipoprotein secretion by SAR1B than SAR1A. These data present clear biochemical differences between the two paralogs that provide a possible explanation for the differences seen in genetic data. There are only 20 of 198 divergent amino acids that distinguish human SAR1A and SAR1B. Because highly conserved amino acid residues tend to be functionally important (17Capra J.A. Singh M. Predicting functionally important residues from sequence conservation.Bioinformatics. 2007; 23 (17519246): 1875-188210.1093/bioinformatics/btm270Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), we first wanted to compare how the SAR1A/B divergence appears in evolutionary history and determine which divergent amino acids are most conserved. We retrieved the amino acid sequences from the Ensembl database (18Zerbino D.R. Achuthan P. Akanni W. Amode M.R. Barrell D. Bhai J. Billis K. Cummins C. Gall A. Girón C.G. Gil L. Gordon L.

Fast, scalable generation of high-quality protein multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7 (539 21988835): 53910.1038/msb.2011.75Crossref PubMed Scopus (9093) Google Scholar). We found that in reptiles, birds, and mammals, there were conserved distinct SAR1A and SAR1B paralogs, whereas in some fish, such as zebrafish, there was a distinct SAR1B allele and a more intermediate SAR1AB allele closer to the invertebrate ancestral gene (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that comparing mammalian, reptile, and bird alleles would provide a broad consistent background for determining which paralog-specific amino acid differences are conserved. We next looked for candidate amino acids that might lead to divergent functions. Primary sequence alignment of human SAR1A and SAR1B found three clusters where three or more amino acids diverged in close proximity. Of those three clusters, two were highly conserved among mammals, reptiles, and birds (106–117 and 139–146) (Fig. 1B), whereas one (162–164) was less conserved. SAR1 residues 139–146 are adjacent to the GTP-binding pocket, and residues 106–117 are on an α-helix near the known binding site of SEC31 on SEC23 (Fig. 1, C and D). Notably, the divergent amino acids on the α-helix all appear on the exposed surface of the protein, suggesting that they may have a role in protein–protein interactions. The importance of the interaction between SEC31 and the SAR1 GTPase cycle for large cargo secretion has been well documented (6Saito K. Maeda M. Katada T. Regulation of the Sar1 GTPase cycle is necessary for large cargo secretion from the endoplasmic reticulum.Front. Cell Dev.

In this assay, the nucleotide-bound state of Sar1 is monitored by relative fluorescence measurements. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of SAR1-GTP is significantly higher than that of SAR1-GDP. We first analyzed the kinetics of GTP exchange upon addition of GTP to the reaction. We found that, with full-length SAR1 in the presence of liposomes, SAR1A loaded significantly faster than SAR1B (Fig. 2A). This difference applied to soluble forms of SAR1 that lack the N-terminal amphipathic helix and, as a result, do not require liposomes (Fig. 2B). Addition of the SAR1 guanine exchange factor SEC12 proportionally increased the loading speed of both paralogs (Fig. 2C). We confirmed that this effect was unrelated to hydrolysis by substitution of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog 5′-Guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GMP-PNP) (Fig. 2D). We hypothesized that this difference may be due to the GTP-adjacent divergent residues. To test this, we purified SAR1 proteins with the divergent amino acids swapped between paralogs (SAR1A>B-GTPa and SAR1B>A-GTPa). We found that changing these three amino acids reversed the kinetic differences between SAR1A and SAR1B (Fig. 2E). Conversely, we found that constructs in which the amino acids of the divergent apical α-helix (SAR1A>B-helix and SAR1B>A-helix) were swapped did not reverse the kinetics (Fig. 2F). These data suggest that the GTP-adjacent divergent residues are necessary and sufficient for the increased kinetics of SAR1 GTP exchange. Having observed differences in GTP loading, we probed the SAR1 paralogs for GTP hydrolysis using the tryptophan fluorescence assay. We did not find a strong consistent difference between the two paralogs in the presence of different sizes of liposomes (Fig. S1A) or SEC23A or SEC23B (Fig. S1B). This evidence suggests that, although SAR1A exchanges nucleotide more quickly that SAR1B, GTP hydrolysis may be unaffected, at least in vitro. One of the two divergent clusters between SAR1A and SAR1B is adjacent to the known SEC31/SEC23 binding site. We therefore hypothesized that this cluster may be important for direct binding of SEC31 to SAR1. To test the extent of direct binding between SAR1 and SEC31, we utilized a liposome flotation assay. Purified recombinant human SAR1 and the GTPase-activating fragment of SEC31A (SEC31A-af) were incubated with synthetic liposomes and GMP-PNP. The reaction was applied to the bottom of a sucrose density gradient. After a high-speed centrifugation step, liposomes carried bound SAR1 and any SEC31 bound to that SAR1 with them as they floated to the top of the sucrose gradient (Fig. 3A). We then evaluated the levels of SAR1 and SEC31A-af present on the liposomes by SDS-PAGE followed by SYPRO-Ruby staining. We found that SAR1A recruited SEC31A-af ∼2-fold more efficiently than SAR1B (Fig. 3, B and C). When we performed the same assay with SAR1A>B-helix and SAR1B>A-helix, however, the difference became negligible, suggesting that the divergent α-helix played a role in SEC31 binding but was not the sole reason for differences between SAR1A and SAR1B. Here we made a secondary observation. Despite having similar molecular weights, SAR1B migrated more slowly in SDS-PAGE gels than SAR1. However, SAR1A>B-helix migrated similarly as SAR1B and SAR1B>A-helix similarly as SAR1A (Fig. 3B). Therefore, whatever causes this different migration of the two paralogs is contained in the α-helix. We then compared SAR1A>B-GTPa and SAR1BA-GTPa. Unexpectedly, swapping the GTP-adjacent divergent residues had a more significant effect than swapping the α-helix (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that the GTP-adjacent residues have as much of a role, if not more, than the divergent α-helix in SEC31 binding. Because the portion of SEC31A that has been resolved by crystallography is relatively small, the extent of the binding between SEC31 and SAR1 is unknown. To confirm whether the GTP-adjacent residues directly bind SEC31A-af, we used photo-cross-linking to an unnatural amino acid in recombinant SAR1 protein. We verified that the assay detected SEC31A-af binding by inserting an unnatural amino acid at position 80, directly adjacent to the known SEC23A/SEC31A-af binding site. Cross-linking was stimulated by incubation with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS and either SAR1 paralog (Fig. 3D). We then repeated this by inserting the unnatural amino acid at residue 139 (threonine in SAR1A and proline in SAR1B). We chose this residue because it is the part of the GTP-adjacent cluster that is most distant from the known SEC23A/SEC31A binding site, and, therefore, background binding is likely to be low. Cross-linking was stimulated by GTPγS primarily in SAR1A (Fig. 3E), consistent with our liposome flotation data. These data suggest that both divergent clusters play a role in SAR1–SEC31 binding and that SAR1A has a higher affinity for direct binding of SEC31. Although our data show that SAR1 can directly bind SEC31, SAR1 normally binds SEC31 in conjunction with SEC23. Using the liposome flotation assay, we compared recruitment of SEC23 and SEC31 by the two SAR1 paralogs. Because SEC23A and SEC23B also have paralog-specific roles in large cargo secretion, we also tested whether SAR1 had a different affinity for SEC23A or SEC23B by adding both in competition to the reaction. We found a strong divergence between SAR1A and SAR1B in their recruitment of either paralog of SEC23. SAR1B recruits SEC23 at an ∼5-fold higher level than SAR1A (Fig. 4, A and C). Addition of SEC31A-af increased the binding of both SAR1 paralogs for both SEC23 paralogs, but the binding of SAR1B to SEC23 remained ∼5-fold higher than SAR1A. To determine which amino acids in SAR1 were responsible for the divergence in SEC23 recruitment, we repeated the flotation assay with the GTP-adjacent and helix SAR1 variants. We found that swapping the divergent α-helix reversed affinity for SEC23, reducing SAR1B>A-helix binding to SEC23 by ∼2-fold instead of a 5-fold increase (Fig. 4, B and C). These data suggest that the divergent α-helix leads to SAR1B having a higher affinity for SEC23. We hypothesized that SAR1B's greater affinity for SEC23 may interfere with SAR1A's ability to recruit SEC23 and the remaining elements of the COPII coat if it were present in excess over SAR1A. To test this, we performed the liposome flotation assay using the soluble N-terminally deleted SAR1. We hypothesized that addition of soluble SAR1B may decrease the amount of SEC23 recruited by SAR1A by sequestering the available pool of protein. However, we found the opposite: addition of either soluble SAR1 paralog enhanced SEC23 recruitment (Fig. 4D). Enhanced recruitment of SEC23 may be due to formation of SAR1 dimers on the membrane (26Hariri H. Bhattacharya N. Johnson K. Noble A.J. Stagg S.M. Insights into the mechanisms of membrane curvature and vesicle scission by the small GTPase Sar1 in the early secretory pathway.J. Mol.

In fact, we found a significant amount of soluble SAR1 recruited to the membrane, although we were unable to distinguish soluble SAR1B from SAR1A, as the shortened SAR1B and the full-length SAR1A have the same SDS-PAGE mobility. SAR1A appeared to be prone to recruiting soluble SAR1 more than SAR1B (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that SAR1A may have a higher affinity for homodimerization than SAR1B. To evaluate oligomerization of SAR1 on a membrane surface, we developed a liposome aggregation assay. We hypothesized that SAR1 dimerization could cause small liposomes to aggregate, decreasing the number of particles and increasing their size. We prepared small 100-nm synthetic liposomes and incubated them with SAR1 and GTP-PNP. After overnight incubation, SAR1A-containing liposomes formed aggregates easily visible by light microscopy (Fig. 5A), whereas SAR1B-containing liposomes were indistinguishable from liposomes alone. The size and number of particles in the suspension were then evaluated with a Nanosight particle analyzer. To detect smaller particles that could be reliably quantified by Nanosight, we used lower protein concentrations and shorter incubation times. Under these conditions, nanoparticle tracking allowed us to see a difference between liposomes alone and liposomes with SAR1B. SAR1B-containing liposomes were larger on average and fewer in number than liposomes alone, suggesting that SAR1B does undergo some homodimerization. The change in particle number and size is more substantial with SAR1A (Fig. 5B). Addition of SEC23/24 heterodimer greatly increased the size of particles and reduced their number (Fig. 5B), as expected, because SEC23 binds directly to SAR1A and SAR1B, and the heterodimers bind each other. To test whether this effect was due to either of the divergent peptide clusters, we repeated this assay with the WT (Fig. 5C), helix (Fig. 5D), and GTP-adjacent cluster (Fig. 5E) SAR1 constructs. We found that swapping the divergent α-helix caused SAR1BA-helix to promote liposome aggregation more than SAR1AB-helix (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the divergent α-helix is the primary driver of SAR1A oligomerization/aggregation. We found that swapping the GPTa cluster also resulted in increased aggregation by SAR1BA-GTPa (Fig. 5E). This effect is milder than that seen with SAR1BA-helix, suggesting that the GTP-adjacent cluster may also play a role in oligomerization but a relatively minor one compared with the apical α-helix. These data suggest that SAR1A oligomerizes on a membrane surface and the divergent α-helix has a more prominent role in this association than the GTP-adjacent cluster. To test the functionally significant differences of the SAR1 paralogs in cells, we measured apolipoprotein secretion in transfected cells. For this purpose, we developed CRISPR-Cas9–mediated SAR1B knockdown with the lipoprotein-secreting rat hepatoma cell line McArdle RH7777. Cells were incubated in oleic acid–containing medium from which samples were withdrawn every 1–3 h. Aliquots of medium were subjected to density sedimentation on an OptiPrep gradient to collect the buoyant lipoproteins. Secreted APO1B was detected and quantified by immunoblot. As has been found previously (29Fryer L.G. Jones B. Duncan E.J. Hutchison C.E. Ozkan T. Williams P.A. Alder O. Nieuwdorp M. Townley A.K. Mensenkamp A.R. Stephens D.J. Dallinga-Thie G.M.

Using lipoprotein secretion–deficient SAR1B−/− cells, we generated inducible cell lines using a lentivirus and a tetracycline repressor system to control the expression of SAR1 by addition of doxycycline. We found that overexpression of SAR1B increased the amount of APOB100 secreted into the medium whereas overexpression of SAR1A did not (Fig. 6B). Overexpression of the GTP-adjacent swap SAR1B>A produced an ∼2-fold increase in ApoB secretion, similar to the effect of WT SAR1B, suggesting that the GTP-adjacent amino acid cluster is not relevant to the SAR1B-specific function. Overexpression of the α-helix swap SAR1B>A failed to increase APOB100 secretion, whereas SAR1A>B increased ApoB secretion ∼2-fold, suggesting that the α-helix is most important for the paralog-specific function of SAR1B in lipoprotein secretion. Taken together, these data suggest that SAR1A and SAR1B differ biochemically. The paralogs have two divergent clusters of amino acids, one adjacent to the GTP binding pocket and one in an α-helix on the apical side of the protein, that have conserved paralog–specific sequences and functions. The GTP-adjacent cluster causes SAR1A to exchange GTP more rapidly than SAR1B. The apical α-helix cluster causes SAR1B to have a higher affinity for SEC23A and has an important role in lipoprotein secretion. Vertebrate cells have a wide variety of distinct secretory requirements in the types of cargo and the overall cargo load. Evolution of different paralogs of the basic machinery gives cells specialized tools to deal with the particular needs of a given cell at a given time. We found how small changes in the primary sequence of SAR1 paralogs lead to different biochemical characteristics that have significant effects on cellular function. It is easy to think of SAR1 as just a small part of a bigger COPII machinery rather than focusing on the important roles of SAR1 itself. Hanna et al. (27Hanna 4th, M.G. Mela I. Wang L. Henderson R.M.

Despite intensive investigations, biogenesis of endosomes, boundaries between early and late endosomes, and process of cargo transition though them remain obscure. Here, using EGF/EGFR endocytosis as a model and confocal microscopy of fixed and live cells, we provide evidence favoring EEA1-vesicles being pre-existed vesicular compartment, that maintains its resident proteins’ level and is sensitive to biosynthetic, but not endocytic pathway disturbance. EEA1-vesicles directly fuse with incoming EGF/EGFR-vesicles into hybrid endosomes with separated EEA1- and EGFR-domains, thus providing a platform for rapid achievement of an excess of surface-derived membrane that is used to form intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). Thus, multivesicular structures colocalized with EEA1 are still early endosomes. “EEA1-cycle” ends by exclusion of EGFR-containing domains with ILVs inside that turns into MVE and restoration of initial EEA1-vesicles population."

In June-July 2017, we carried out a national cross-sectional survey of physicians working in randomly selected primary healthcare practices, and interviewed them by telephone. We assessed support for vaccinations using an ordinal scale (0–6) comprised of three equally weighted questions on the respondent support of the programme and vaccination of self and family. We also created a scale (0–3) based on correct answers to vaccination myths. We used ordered logistic regression to investigate factors independently influencing support for vaccinations, reporting the proportional odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for one unit increase in the support score. Of 2,609 respondents contacted, we interviewed 500 (19%). The median vaccination support score (0–6) was 5 (IQR 2). After adjusting for other variables, we did not find significant effects of sex, medical specialty, adhering to recommendations, attending a conference in previous year, using non-scientific sources of information and self-assessed knowledge on vaccination support score. Age over 60 years, correctly addressing vaccination myths and use of one or more than one scientific sources of knowledge, significantly improved support for vaccinations (aOR = 1.97, 1.57, 3.09 and 2.68, respectively).

Higher levels of HDL have been associated with protection in other diseases, however, its role in prostate cancer is not definitive. SR-B1 is up-regulated in prostate cancer tissue, suggesting a possible role of this receptor in tumor progression. Here, we report that knockout (KO) of SR-B1 in both human and mouse prostate cancer cell lines through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing reduces HDL uptake into the prostate cancer cells and reduces their proliferation in response to HDL. In vivo studies using syngeneic SR-B1 WT (SR-B1+/+) and SR-B1 KO (SR-B1−/−) prostate cancer cells in WT and apolipoprotein-AI KO (apoA1-KO) C57BL/6J mice revealed that WT hosts, containing higher levels of total and HDL-cholesterol, grew larger tumors than apoA1-KO hosts with lower levels of total and HDL-cholesterol. Furthermore, SR-B1−/− prostate cancer cells formed smaller tumors in WT hosts than SR-B1+/+ cells in the same host model. Increased tumor volume was overall associated with reduced survival. We conclude that knocking out SR-B1 in prostate cancer tumors reduces HDL-associated increases in prostate cancer cell proliferation and disease progression."

Within the last years, the status of high disease activity (HDA) has become increasingly important for clinical decisions. Nevertheless, little is known about the incidence, the characteristics, and the current treatment of patients with RRMS and HDA in Germany. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the incidence of HDA in a German RRMS patient population, to characterize this population and to describe current drug treatment routines and further healthcare utilization of these patients.A claims data analyses has been conducted, using a sample of the InGef Research Database that comprises data of approximately four million insured persons from around 70 German statutory health insurances (SHI). The study was conducted in a retrospective cohort design, including the years 2012-2016. Identification of RRMS population based on ICD-10 code (ICD-10-GM: G35.1). For identification of HDA, criteria from other studies as well as expert opinions have been used. Information on incidence, characteristics and current treatment of patients with RRMS and HDA was considered.The overall HDA incidence within the RRMS population was 8.5% for 2016. It was highest for the age group of 0-19 years (29.4% women, 33.3% men) and lowest for the age group of ≥ 50 years (4.3% women, 5.6% men). Mean age of patients with RRMS and incident HDA was 38.4 years (SD: 11.8) and women accounted for 67.8%. Analyses of drug utilization showed that 82.4% received at least one disease-modifying drug (DMD) in 2016. A percentage of 49.8% of patients received drugs for relapse therapy. A share of 55% of RRMS patients with HDA had at least one hospitalization with a mean length of stay of 13.9 days (SD: 18.3 days) in 2016. The average number of outpatient physician contacts was 28.1 (SD: 14.0).This study based on representative Germany-wide claims data from the SHI showed a high incidence of HDA especially within the young RRMS population. Future research should consider HDA as an important criterion for the quality of care for MS patients."

In this article, we propose to use the cumulative prospect theory to design weather insurance products for situations in which farmers frame insurance narrowly as a stand-alone investment. To this end, we introduce what we call “behavioral weather insurance” whereby insurance contract parameters are adjusted to correspond more closely with farmers’ preferences. Depending on farmers’ preferences, we find that a stochastic multiyear premium increases the prospect value of weather insurance, while a zero deductible design does not. We suggest that insurance contracts should be tailored precisely to serve farmers’ needs. This offers potential benefits for both the insurer and the insured."

https://openalex.org/W3021602409,"Background Nurses are a critical part of healthcare delivery systems, especially in under-resourced environments. Compared to other female-dominated professions in South Africa, nurses are securely employed and relatively well-paid. However, they are often drawn from complex, poor communities where they are responsible for many dependents and must accommodate community and family expectations of financial, health, and other forms of support. Aim The aim of the study was to explore public hospital-employed, black women nurses’ lived experiences to better understand their stressors and consider interventions that may reduce psychological distress. Methods In 2015, we conducted semi-structured life history interviews with 71 nurses in Johannesburg. Using grounded theory and social network mapping, we trace complex, interrelated stressors and networks of familial dependency. Results Every participant experienced high levels of stress. Nurses described daily lives of chronic distress, with extreme pressures on their incomes, time, and resources. Much of the pressure on nurses comes from familial and partner dependency, both in absolute number of dependents and intensity, and related financial obligations and debt. Dependency is a function of social and cultural norms which assign women primary responsibility for unpaid work, yet nurses characterized their efforts as unsustainable and anxiety-inducing; their pay and paid work schedules made meeting that responsibility virtually impossible. Conclusions The structure of the nursing occupation contributes to stress outside the workplace, while the structure of nurses’ households contributes to stress and emotional exhaustion. The integrated nature of their chronic stress suggests that occupationally-oriented interventions are unlikely to adequately address it. To fully alleviate chronic stress, the gender norms that place responsibility for unpaid work on nurses with already full-time employment need to shift. A better understanding of the extensive networks dependent on nurses should inform interventions designed to improve their wellbeing.

This study aimed to analyze the chemical composition of C. tiglium essential oil (CTEO) extracted from the seeds of C. tiglium and its cytotoxicity and antitumor effect in vitro. Supercritical CO2 fluid extraction technology was used to extract CTEO and the chemical constituents of the essential oil were identified by comparing the retention indices and mass spectra data taken from the NIST library with those calculated based on the C7-C40 n-alkanes standard. In vitro cytotoxicity of the CTEO was assessed against cancer cell lines (A549) and the human normal bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) using the CCK-8 assay. Proliferation was detected by colony formation experiments. Wound scratch and cell invasion assays were used to detect cell migration and invasion. Levels of apoptotic markers, signaling molecules, and cell cycle regulators expression were characterized by Western blot analysis. As the results, twenty-eight compounds representing 92.39% of the total oil were identified in CTEO. The CTEO has significant antitumor activity on A549 cancer cells (IC50 48.38 μg/mL). In vitro antitumor experiments showed that CTEO treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of A549 cells, disrupted the cell cycle process, and reduced the expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin B and CDK1. CTEO can also reduce mitochondrial membrane potential, activate caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway, and finally induce apoptosis. CTEO may become an effective anti-cancer drug and will be further developed for cancer treatment."

This capacity depends on the integration of extracellular signaling through multiple receptors, including the T-cell receptor (TCR), co-receptors, and cytokine receptors. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signals through its cognate receptor, TGFβR, to SMAD family member proteins and contributes to the generation of a transcriptional program that promotes regulatory T-cell differentiation. In addition to transcription, here we identified specific signaling networks that are regulated by TGFβR. Using an array of biochemical approaches, including immunoblotting, kinase assays, immunoprecipitation, and flow cytometry, we found that TGFβR signaling promotes the formation of a SMAD3/4-protein kinase A (PKA) complex that activates C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) and thereby down-regulates kinases involved in proximal TCR activation. Additionally, TGFβR signaling potentiated CSK phosphorylation of the P85 subunit in the P85–P110 phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) heterodimer, which reduced PI3K activity and down-regulated the activation of proteins that require phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) for their activation. Moreover, TGFβR-mediated disruption of the P85–P110 interaction enabled P85 binding to a lipid phosphatase, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), aiding in the maintenance of PTEN abundance and thereby promoting elevated PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels in response to TGFβR signaling. Taken together, these results highlight that TGF-β influences the trajectory of early T-cell activation by altering PI3K activity and PtdIns levels.

These reporter strains contain the necessary genetically encoded parts for studying human GPCR signaling in yeast, as well as four CRISPR-addressable expression cassettes, i.e. landing pads, installed at known safe-harbor sites in the yeast genome. We showcase the utility of these strains in two applications. First, we demonstrate that increasing GPCR expression by incrementally increasing GPCR gene copy number potentiates Gα coupling of the pharmacologically dark receptor GPR68. Second, we used two CRISPR-addressable landing pads for autocrine activation of a GPCR (the somatostatin receptor SSTR5) with its peptide agonist SRIF-14. The utility of these reporter strains can be extended far beyond these select examples to include applications such as nanobody development, mutational analysis, drug discovery, and studies of GPCR chaperoning. Additionally, we present a BY4741 yeast strain created for broad applications in the yeast and synthetic biology communities that contains only the four CRISPR-addressable landing pads.

https://openalex.org/W3023336853,"The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) is a non-native invasive species that rapidly spread northward in the United States after its introduction from South America in the 1930s. Researchers predicted that the northward spread of this invasive ant would be limited by cold temperatures with increased latitude and greater elevation in the Blue Ridge Escarpment region of the United States. The presence of S. invicta at relatively high elevations north of their projected limits suggests greater cold tolerance than previously predicted; however, these populations might be ephemeral indications of strong dispersal abilities. In this study, we investigated potential physiological adaptations of S. invicta that would indicate acclimation to high elevation environments. We hypothesized that if S. invicta colonies can persist in colder climates than where they originated, we would find gradients in S. invicta worker cold tolerance along a montane elevational gradient. We also predicted that higher elevation S. invicta ants might incur greater physiological costs to persist in the colder climate, so we measured colony lipid content to assess health status. For comparison, we also collected physiological temperature tolerance data for the co-occurring dominant native woodland ant Aphaenogaster picea. We found that S. invicta occurring at higher elevations exhibited greater physiological tolerance for cold temperatures as compared to lower-elevation conspecifics–a cold tolerance pattern that paralleled of the native A. picea ants along the same gradient. Both S. invicta and A. picea similarly exhibited lower thermal tolerances for colder temperatures when moving up the elevational gradient, with A. picea consistently exhibiting a lower thermal tolerance overall. There was no change in S. invicta colony lipid content with elevation, suggesting that greater metabolic rates were not needed to sustain these ants at high elevations."
https://openalex.org/W3023987421,"Inducibility of defences in response to biotic stimuli is considered an important trait in plant resistance. In conifers, previous research has mostly focused on the inducibility of the volatile fraction of the oleoresin (mono- and sesquiterpenes), leaving the inducibility of the non-volatile resin acids largely unexplored, particularly in response to real herbivory. Here we investigated the differences in the inducibility of resin acids in two pine species, one native from Europe (Pinus pinaster Ait.) and another from North America (Pinus radiata D. Don), in response to wounding by two European insects: a bark chewer, the pine weevil (Hylobius abietis L.), and a defoliator, the pine processionary caterpillar (Thaumetopoea pityocampa Schiff.). We quantified the constitutive (control) and induced concentrations of resin acids in the stem and needles of both pine species by gas chromatography techniques. Both pine species strongly increased the concentration of resin acids in the stem after pine weevil feeding, although the response was greater in P. pinaster than in P. radiata. However, systemic defensive responses in the needles were negligible in both pine species after pine weevil feeding in the stem. On the other hand, P. radiata locally reduced the resin acid concentration in the needles after pine caterpillar feeding, whereas in P. pinaster resin acid concentration was apparently unaffected. Nevertheless, systemic induction of resin acids was only observed in the stem of P. pinaster in response to pine caterpillar feeding. In summary, pine induced responses were found highly compartmentalized, and specific to herbivore identity. Particularly, plant defence suppression mechanisms by the pine caterpillar, and ontogenetic factors might be potentially affecting the induced response of resin acids in both pine species."
https://openalex.org/W3021136060,"TSPO2 (translocator protein 2) is a transmembrane protein specifically expressed in late erythroblasts and has been postulated to mediate intracellular redistribution of cholesterol. We identified TSPO2 as the causative gene for the HK (high-K+) trait with immature red cell phenotypes in dogs and investigated the effects of the TSPO2 defects on erythropoiesis in HK dogs with the TSPO2 mutation and Tspo2 knockout (Tspo2−/−) mouse models. Bone marrow–derived erythroblasts from HK dogs showed increased binucleated and apoptotic cells at various stages of maturation and shed large nuclei with incomplete condensation when cultured in the presence of erythropoietin, indicating impaired maturation and cytokinesis. The canine TSPO2 induces cholesterol accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum and could thereby regulate cholesterol availability by changing intracellular cholesterol distribution in erythroblasts. Tspo2−/− mice consistently showed impaired cytokinesis with increased binucleated erythroblasts, resulting in compensated anemia, and their red cell membranes had increased Na,K-ATPase, resembling the HK phenotype in dogs. Tspo2-deficient mouse embryonic stem cell–derived erythroid progenitor (MEDEP) cells exhibited similar morphological defects associated with a cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and had a depletion in intracellular unesterified and esterified cholesterol. When the terminal maturation was induced, Tspo2−/− MEDEP cells showed delays in hemoglobinization; maturation-associated phenotypic changes in CD44, CD71, and TER119 expression; and cell-cycle progression. Taken together, these findings imply that TSPO2 is essential for coordination of maturation and proliferation of erythroblasts during normal erythropoiesis."

Self-monitoring needs to be individualized and should assist people with diabetes. This study aimed to assess the predictors of self-management practices among diabetic patients attending hospitals in western Oromia, Ethiopia.A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2017 to February 2018 in hospitals located in western Oromia, Ethiopia. An interview was made with a total of 400 diabetic patients attending the diabetes center and admitted to ward in the study hospitals. The data were entered into Epi Info software version 3.5.4. Data analysis was made using a statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 20. Odds ratio (OR) was used to show the association. The statistical significance was considered at P<0.05, and potential confounding variables were controlled using logistic regression. The analyzed data were presented in texts and tables.From a total of 398 interviewed patients, 129 (32.4%) practiced diabetes self-management. About 63.6% of the study participants' self-management practice was good. Most 103 (79.84%) of those who practiced self-management were presented with one of diabetes mellitus-related complications. Logistic regression analysis results showed that merchants were about six times higher in self-management practice [AOR of 5.945 (1.177-30.027 at 95% CI)] and those having family support in diabetes practiced self-management 2.87 times than others [AOR of 2.835 (1.386-5.801 at 95% CI)].Compared to the findings of previous studies, diabetes self-management practices of the participants was good. The study participants regular physical activity, food intake, medication adherence, and foot self-examination were moderate. Two variables, being a merchant and having family support were found to be the predictors of self-management practices. Predictors of self-management should be considered to boost self-management practice."

Resazurin microtitre plate assay (Checker board) was performed to analyze the activity of plant extracts against M. smegmatis. Synergistic behaviour of plant extracts / D-Pinitol with Isoniazid (INH) and Rifampicin (RIF) were determined by time-kill and checker board assays. Elongation of M. smegmatis cells due to this treatment was determined by light microscopy. The effect of Hexane methanol extract (HXM) plant extracts on cell viability was determined using PI/SYTO9 dual dye reporter Live/Dead assay. Action of HXM plant extracts / D-Pinitol on inhibition of FtsZ protein was done using Guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) light scattering assay and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). The Hexane-methanolic plant extract of Acacia nilotica, Aegle marmelos and Glycyrrhiza glabra showed antimycobacterial activity at 1.56 ± 0.03, 1.32 ± 0.02 and 1.25 ± 0.03 mg/mL respectively and that of INH and RIF were 4.00 ± 0.06 μg/mL and 2.00 ± 0.04 μg/mL respectively. These plant extracts and major phytochemical exudate D-Pinitol was found to act synergistically with antimycobacterial drugs INH and RIF with an FIC index ~ 0.20. Time-Kill kinetics studies indicate that, these plant extracts were bacteriostatic in nature. D-Pinitol in conjunction with INH and RIF exhibited a 2 Log reduction in the growth of viable cells compared to untreated. Attempt to elucidate their mode of action through phenotypic analysis indicated that these plant extracts and D-Pinitol was found to interfere in cell division there by leading to an abnormal elongated cellular morphology. HXM extracts and D-Pinitol synergistically combined with the first line tuberculosis drugs, INH and RIF, to act on M. smegmatis. The increase in the length of M. smegmatis cells on treatment with D-Pinitol and HXM extract of the plants indicated that they hinder the cell division mechanism thereby leading to a filamentous phenotype, and finally leading to cell death. In addition, the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane is also altered causing cell death. Further gene expression analysis showed that these plant extracts and D-Pinitol hampers with function of FtsZ protein which was confirmed through in vitro inhibition of FtsZ-GTPase enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W3021780662,"Optimization of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostics requires the careful selection of molecular targets that are both highly repetitive and pathogen-specific. Advances in both next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and bioinformatics-based analysis tools are facilitating this selection process, informing target choices and reducing labor. Once developed, such assays provide disease control and elimination programs with an additional set of tools capable of evaluating and monitoring intervention successes. The importance of such tools is heightened as intervention efforts approach their endpoints, as accurate and complete information is an essential component of the informed decision-making process. As global efforts for the control and elimination of both lymphatic filariasis and malaria continue to make significant gains, the benefits of diagnostics with improved analytical and clinical/field-based sensitivities and specificities will become increasingly apparent.Coupling Illumina-based NGS with informatics approaches, we have successfully identified the tandemly repeated elements in both the Wuchereria bancrofti and Plasmodium falciparum genomes of putatively greatest copy number. Utilizing these sequences as quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)-based targets, we have developed assays capable of exploiting the most abundant tandem repeats for both organisms. For the detection of P. falciparum, analysis and development resulted in an assay with improved analytical and field-based sensitivity vs. an established ribosomal sequence-targeting assay. Surprisingly, analysis of the W. bancrofti genome predicted a ribosomal sequence to be the genome's most abundant tandem repeat. While resulting cycle quantification values comparing a qPCR assay targeting this ribosomal sequence and a commonly targeted repetitive DNA sequence from the literature supported our finding that this ribosomal sequence was the most prevalent tandemly repeated target in the W. bancrofti genome, the resulting assay did not significantly improve detection sensitivity in conjunction with field sample testing.Examination of pathogen genomes facilitates the development of PCR-based diagnostics targeting the most abundant and specific genomic elements. While in some instances currently available tools may deliver equal or superior performance, systematic analysis of potential targets provides confidence that the selected assays represent the most advantageous options available and that informed assay selection is occurring in the context of a particular study's objectives."
https://openalex.org/W3022288594,"Background Two-drug regimens (2DR) to treat HIV infection have the potential to reduce long-term toxicity and increase therapeutic options for people living with HIV (PLHIV). Prior phase III trials, SWORD-1 and SWORD-2, as well as GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2, have demonstrated that a dolutegravir-based 2DR is as effective as three- or four-drug regimens among virologically suppressed patients. Limited information exists, however, on patient and provider experiences with 2DR to inform roll-out and integration into routine clinical care. Methods We conducted 39 in-depth interviews with PLHIV currently on 2DR in the context of routine care and 8 of their clinical care providers in the United States (U.S.) and Spain. Participants included 33 male and 6 female PLHIV and 8 providers. Interview topics explored perceptions of and experiences with 2DR compared to prior anti-retroviral regimens (ARVs), side effects, patient satisfaction, and clinical performance. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results Participants viewed 2DR as a significant and positive advance, in terms of its ability to effectively treat HIV with reduced toxicity and essentially no reported side effects. Patients noted the central role providers played in the decision to switch to a 2DR regimen and, among U.S. participants, the importance of insurance coverage making this preferred option feasible. Patients and providers agreed that a 2DR regimen would be appropriate for any PLHIV regardless of whether they were treatment naïve or had significant experience with ARVs. Conclusions Participants’ experiences with a 2DR regimen were positive with no participants, reporting side effects and all reporting continued viral suppression. Providers valued the reduced toxicity offered by 2DR and served as the primary gateway to a transition to 2DR for patients in both settings. This study provides a foundation for further research on the transition to 2DR regimens in other populations and contexts including low- and middle-income settings."
https://openalex.org/W3022120376,"Identifying the factors that determine the spatial distribution of biodiversity is a major focus of ecological research. These factors vary with scale from interspecific interactions to global climatic cycles. Wetlands are important biodiversity hotspots and contributors of ecosystem services, but the association between proportional wetland cover and species richness has shown mixed results. It is not well known as to what extent there is a relationship between proportional wetland cover and species richness, especially at the sub-continental scale. We used the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) to model wetland cover for the conterminous United States and the National Land Cover Database to estimate wetland change between 2001 and 2011. We used a Bayesian spatial Poisson model to estimate a spatially varying coefficient surface describing the effect of proportional wetland cover on the distribution of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles and the cumulative distribution of terrestrial endemic species. Species richness and wetland cover were significantly correlated, and this relationship varied both spatially and by taxonomic group. Rather than a continental-scale association, however, we found that this relationship changed more closely among ecoregions. The species richness of each of the five groups was positively associated with wetland cover in some or all of the Great Plains; additionally, a positive association was found for mammals in the Southeastern Plains and Piedmont of the eastern U.S. Model results indicated negative association especially in the Cold Deserts and Northern Lakes & Forests of Minnesota and Wisconsin, though these varied greatly between groups. Our results highlight the need for wetland conservation initiatives that focus efforts at the level II and III ecoregional scale rather than along political boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W3022223965,"Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, has been cloned from various species. However, little research has been conducted on this enzyme in ferns, which occupy a unique evolutionary position. In this study, we isolated two novel DFR genes from the fern Dryopteris erythrosora. In vitro enzymatic analysis revealed that DeDFR1 and DeDFR2 enzymes can catalyze dihydrokaempferol and dihydroquercetin but cannot catalyze dihydromyricetin. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that DeDFR1 and DeDFR2 have an arginine at the same substrate-specificity-determining site as that in the ferns Salvinia cucullata and Azolla filiculoides. Thus, we speculate that the Arg-type DFR is a new DFR functional type. To further verify the substrate preferences of the Arg-type DFR, an amino acid substitution assay was conducted. When N133 was mutated to R133, Arabidopsis DFR protein completely lost its catalytic activity for dihydromyricetin, as observed for DeDFR1 and DeDFR2. Additionally, heterologous expression of DeDFR2 in the Arabidopsis tt3-1 mutant resulted in increasing anthocyanin accumulation. In summary, DeDFR1 and DeDFR2 are considered to be a new type of DFR with unique structures and functions. The discovery of the Arg-type DFR provides new insights into the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in ferns."

Methods Single institution, retrospective, interventional case series of 14 retinoblastoma patients managed with IAC from December 2014 to June 2018. Demographics were described. Outcomes measures were tumor response, treatment complications and globe salvage. Results Subjects’ mean age at the first administration of IAC was 31.4 months. 57.1% of the eyes were Group D and E retinoblastoma, while 79% were bilateral disease. 93% of the eyes were as secondary treatment. Of 32 IAC cannulations performed, 23 (71.8%) were successful and received chemotherapy drug melphalan. Each eye received a mean of 1.8 (range 1–4) IAC injections. 53% of the eyes showed regression post treatment. After a mean follow up period of 19 months, globe salvage rate was 38%. Most of the adverse effects experienced were localized and transient. Conclusion IAC has provided an added recourse in the armamentarium of retinoblastoma treatment in our center. IAC treatment is a viable alternative in the treatment of retinoblastoma to salvage globe, for eyes that would conventionally require enucleation especially in bilateral disease."

The genus Blumenavia belongs to the family Clathraceae and, based on morphological features, only two species are currently recognized: B. rhacodes and B. angolensis. However, the morphological characters adopted in species delimitations within this genus are inconsistent, and molecular data are scarce. The present study aimed to review and identify informative characters that contribute to the delimitation of Blumenavia species. Exsiccates from America and Africa were analyzed morphologically, and molecularly, using ITS, LSU, ATP6, RPB2 and TEF-1α markers for Maximum Parsimony, Bayesian and Maximum likelihood analyses, and also for coalescent based species delimitations (BP&P), as well as for bPTP, PhyloMap, Topo-phylogenetic and Geophylogenetic reconstructions. According to our studies, seven species can be considered in the genus: B. rhacodes and B. angolensis are maintained, B. usambarensis and B. toribiotalpaensis are reassessed, and three new species are proposed, B. baturitensis Melanda, M.P. Martín & Baseia, sp. nov., B. crucis-hellenicae G. Coelho, Sulzbacher, Grebenc & Cortez, sp. nov., and B. heroica Melanda, Baseia & M.P. Martín, sp. nov. Blumenavia rhacodes is typified by selecting a lectotype and an epitype. Macromorphological characters considered informative to segregate and delimit the species through integrative taxonomy include length of the basidiomata, color, width and presence of grooves on each arm as well as the glebifer position and shape. These must be clearly observed while the basidiomata are still fresh. Since most materials are usually analyzed after dehydration and deposit in collections, field techniques and protocols to describe fugacious characters from fresh specimen are demanded, as well as the use of molecular analysis, in order to better assess recognition and delimitation of species in Blumenavia."

Here we report the results of 19F NMR measurements that reveal the conformational properties of a protease and its zymogen precursor in the free form. Using the trypsin-like, clotting protease thrombin as a relevant model system, we show that its conformation is quite different from that of its direct zymogen precursor prethrombin-2 and more similar to that of its fully active Na+-bound form. The results cast doubts on recent hypotheses that free thrombin is zymogen-like and transitions to protease-like forms upon ligand binding. Rather, they validate the scenario emerged from previous findings of X-ray crystallography and rapid kinetics supporting a pre-existing equilibrium between open (E) and closed (E*) forms of the active site. In this scenario, prethrombin-2 is more dynamic and exists predominantly in the E* form, whereas thrombin is more rigid and exists predominantly in the E form. Ligand binding to thrombin takes place exclusively in the E form without significant changes in the overall conformation.

https://openalex.org/W3021751507,"Purpose A study was made of the changes in gene expression in elite handball athletes, comparing gene modulation before, after and in the absence of an 8-week nutritional intervention with multivitamin/mineral supplements. Methods Thirteen elite handball athletes (aged 22.9 ± 2.7 years) and 13 sedentary controls (aged 20.9 ± 2.8 years) were included. Three timepoints were established: T0 (baseline conditions); T8 (after 8 weeks of supplementation with a multivitamin/mineral complex); and T16 (after 8 weeks in the absence of supplementation). The expressions of a total 112 of genes were evaluated by RT-qPCR analysis with the QuantStudioTM 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System. Results The analysis revealed different gene regulation profiles of genes implicated in cell communication, cell energy metabolism, inflammation and the immune system, oxidative stress and muscle function in athletes compared to sedentary controls under resting conditions (upregulated genes: effect size = large, ƞ2 = 1.011 to 1.398, p < 0.05; downregulated genes: effect size = large, ƞ2 = 0.846 and 1.070, p < 0.05, respectively). The nutritional intervention encouraged gene upregulation in elite athletes (p < 0.05). In a follow-up investigation, the IRAK1, CD81, ITGB1, ACADS PDHA2 and GPX1 genes were downregulated in athletes, with a moderate main effect for time-by-group interaction (ηP2 = 0.099 to 0.133; p < 0.05). Additionally, nutritional genes such as MTHFR and THTPA revealed a moderate effect over all the timepoints and group interaction in the study (ηP2 = 0.070 to 0.092; p < 0.05). Conclusions Elite handball athletes showed a different expression profile in reference to key genes implicated in several sports performance-related functions compared to the sedentary controls, in addition to modulation of gene expression after multivitamin/mineral supplementation."

However, plants produce triterpenoids in low abundance, and their complex structures make their chemical synthesis prohibitively expensive and often impossible. As such, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been explored as an alternative means of production. An important triterpenoid is oleanolic acid because it is the precursor to many bioactive triterpenoids of commercial interest, such as QS-21 which is being evaluated as a vaccine adjuvant in clinical trials against HIV and malaria. Oleanolic acid is derived from 2,3-oxidosqualene (natively produced by yeast) via a cyclisation and a multi-step oxidation reaction, catalysed by a β-amyrin synthase and a cytochrome P450 of the CYP716A subfamily, respectively. Although many homologues have been characterised, previous studies have used arbitrarily chosen β-amyrin synthases and CYP716As to produce oleanolic acid and its derivatives in yeast. This study presents the first comprehensive comparison of β-amyrin synthase and CYP716A enzyme activities in yeast. Strains expressing different homologues are compared for production, revealing 6.3- and 4.5-fold differences in β-amyrin and oleanolic acid productivities and varying CYP716A product profiles, which are important to consider when engineering strains for the production of bioactive oleanolic acid derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W3022993983,"Background The increasing incidence of thyroid cancer has been described worldwide. Overdiagnosis, improved imaging, and increased environmental risk factors have contributed to the rising incidence. The objective of this study was to analyze the population incidence rate and trends during the period of 2000–2013 in children, adolescents and young adults (AYAs) in Brazil. Methods Data were extracted from 11 population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) encompassing the five geographic regions of Brazil. Incidence rates per million in children (0–14) and AYAs (15–39) according to world population were analyzed according to sex, age, and type of carcinoma. Incidence trends were evaluated using joinpoint regression. Results During 2000 to 2013, we identified 11,081 children and AYAs (0–39 years) with thyroid carcinoma in 11 PBCRs, with an age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) of 42 cases per million. Females had a higher AAIR of 66 cases per million versus 14 cases per million in males. Age-specific incidence rate (ASR) increased with age. Geographic variation was also observed; the Midwest and Southeast regions had the highest ASR in all age groups. The lowest ASR in all age groups was seen in the North region. Papillary subtype was the most common. Overall, the incidence rates in children and AYAs significantly increased from 0.2 in 2000 to 2.8 in 2013 and from 47.1 to 115.3, respectively, with an annual average percent change of 18.8 [8.1; 30.6] for children and 7.9 [CI 5.6; 10.3] for AYAs. Conclusions Rates of thyroid cancer, particularly the papillary subtype, are steadily increasing in children and AYAs, especially among females. There are variations among geographic areas. This increased incidence is unlikely to be explained by screening, as children less than 14 years of age do not typically undergo medical surveillance. Environmental risk factors must be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W3023990631,"Atherosclerosis is a progressive inflammation in systemic vessels, and pesticide exposure has been emerging as its risk factor. This cross-sectional study investigated the association between pesticide exposure and the risk of atherosclerosis in a rural population in Korea using carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). This study used dataset from the baseline survey of the Korea Farmers Cohort Study between November 2005 and January 2008, and the final analysis included 477 participants. Well-structured questionnaires were used to estimate pesticide exposure. CIMT ≥ 0.9 mm was established for carotid atherosclerosis. Multiple logistic regression analyses were undertaken to evaluate the association between pesticide exposure and atherosclerosis, adjusting demographic and health-related confounders. Even after adjustments, the increased risk of atherosclerosis was significantly associated with pesticide exposure, such as a lifetime history of farming (odds ratio [OR] 3.25 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51–6.98), a history of using pesticide (OR 3.42 95% CI 1.63–7.16), using pesticide 10 times or more annually (OR 2.55 95% CI 1.21–5.39), and higher cumulative exposure index level (OR 3.63 95% CI 1.65–7.97). Further prospective studies are required to elucidate effects of pesticide exposure on the risk of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W3020832465,"To examine the efficacy of motile sperm organelle morphology examination (MSOME) and intracytoplasmic morphologically-selected sperm injection (IMSI) for unexplained infertility.This historical study, included 271 couples with primary, unexplained infertility/male subfertility, treated at an outpatient, IVF clinic, 2015-2018. These couples underwent MSOME after ≥3 failed intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles and ≥1 failed IVF-ICSI cycle. They proceeded to intracytoplasmic morphologically-selected sperm injection (IMSI) within 6 months of MSOME. IMSI is conducted on the day of oocyte pick-up with a fresh semen sample. Pregnancy and delivery rates were analyzed.The cohort was divided based on percentage of normal cells at MSOME: Group A included 55 with no normal cells, Group B, 184 with 0.5%≤ normal cells ≤1.5% and Group C, 32 with ≥2% normal cells. Normal spermatozoa were found in 49 (89%) of Group A after extensive search. Group A had higher pregnancy rate (62.7%) compared to B (47.2%, P = 0.05) and C (28.1%, P = 0.002). Group B had higher pregnancy rate than C (p = 0.045). Delivery rate was higher in Group A (52.1%) compared to B (34.1%, p = 0.023) and C (21.9%, p = 0.007). Pregnancy and delivery rates were higher in A compared to B+C (p = 0.018, p = 0.01, respectively).MSOME may be useful for evaluating unexplained infertility. IMSI can be recommended for men with <2% normal spermatozoa at MSOME."
https://openalex.org/W3021230761,"Various produce including cantaloupe, caramel-coated apples, and packaged salads, have been recognized in recent years as vehicles for listeriosis, a human foodborne disease caused by intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Our knowledge regarding the role of these foods in L. monocytogenes virulence, however, is limited. Understanding their role in modulating L. monocytogenes virulence can be useful in risk assessments and for developing control measures. In this study, we employed the Galleria mellonella larvae model to evaluate virulence potential of fifteen clinical, environmental and food isolates of L. monocytogenes, related to three major outbreaks, after growth on different foods. The non-human pathogen Listeria innocua was also included in the panel. Strains were inoculated in parallel in 5ml of brain heart infusion (BHI) broth, and on the surfaces of cantaloupe and apple fragments (5g each) at about 105 colony forming units (CFU)/ml/fragment. One set of inoculated broth and food fragments was incubated at 10°C for 5 days while the second set was kept at 25°C for 3 days. L. monocytogenes cells were recovered from the fruits and BHI, washed twice, re-suspended in saline, and used to inoculate G. mellonella larvae at final concentrations of 106 and 105 CFU/larva. The larvae were incubated at 37°C and monitored for mortality (LT50-time taken to kill 50% of the larvae) and phenotypic changes over seven days. L. monocytogenes grown on cantaloupe and apple flesh surfaces resulted in higher virulence than when grown in BHI. L. monocytogenes infection at 106 CFU/larvae resulted in an average LT50 of ≤ 30, 36 and 47 hours on cantaloupe, apples and BHI, respectively. These results represent a 2.5-4-fold increased mortality compared with an LT50 ≥120 hours in larvae infected with the same doses of L. innocua grown in corresponding matrices. Similar trends were also recorded with doses of about 105 CFU /larvae."
https://openalex.org/W3021847905,"Cleavage of aromatic carbon-chlorine bonds is critical for the degradation of toxic industrial compounds. Here, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of chlorothalonil dehalogenase (Chd) from Pseudomonas sp. CTN-3, with 15 of its N-terminal residues truncated (ChdT), using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion refined to 1.96 A resolution. Chd has low sequence identity (<15%) compared with all other proteins whose structures are currently available, and to the best of our knowledge, we present the first structure of a Zn(II)-dependent aromatic dehalogenase that does not require a coenzyme. ChdT forms a head-to-tail homodimer, formed between two α-helices from each monomer, with three Zn(II)-binding sites, two of which occupy the active sites, whereas the third anchors a structural site at the homodimer interface. The catalytic Zn(II) ions are solvent-accessible via a large hydrophobic (8.5 × 17.8 A) opening to bulk solvent and two hydrophilic branched channels. Each active-site Zn(II) ion resides in a distorted trigonal bipyramid geometry with His117, His257, Asp116, Asn216, and a water/hydroxide as ligands. A conserved His residue, His114, is hydrogen-bonded to the Zn(II)-bound water/hydroxide and likely functions as the general acid-base. We examined substrate binding by docking chlorothalonil (2,4,5,6-tetrachloroisophtalonitrile, TPN) into the hydrophobic channel and observed that the most energetically favorable pose includes a TPN orientation that coordinates to the active-site Zn(II) ions via a CN and that maximizes a π-π interaction with Trp227 On the basis of these results, along with previously reported kinetics data, we propose a refined catalytic mechanism for Chd-mediated TPN dehalogenation."
https://openalex.org/W3022977580,"The goal of this study was to determine the co-occurrence between acetochlor use on crops and potentially vulnerable soils in the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel region of Western Africa. Acetochlor, a pre-emergence herbicide, is used primarily on row crops and has the potential to reach groundwater or surface water following a rain event shortly after application. Off-field transport is often determined by soil properties; therefore, soils within potential use areas were assessed and mapped to establish areas with soils vulnerable to leaching and/or runoff. Corn and cotton production areas were used as surrogate crops for high potential use areas of acetochlor within areas identified using GlobCover land use data and the Spatial Production Allocation Model agricultural statistics data. The geospatial analysis identified approximately 462 million ha of potentially vulnerable soils in the Sahel region of which 65.7 million ha are within agricultural areas. An adjustment for corn and cotton production areas showed that 2.2 million ha or 3.3% of agricultural fields could have potential restrictions for acetochlor use. Approximately 0.159 million ha of soils or 0.24% of agricultural fields are in the presence of shallow groundwater, defined by depth < 9 m. In addition, 0.0128 million ha or 0.02% were determined to be adjacent to surface water bodies. To understand the uncertainty associated with the use of specific land cover datasets, an overlay assessment was conducted using alternative data sources. Overlap between selected land cover datasets in the Sahel region varies and ranges from 24.7% to 75.5% based on a merged 2009 GlobCover and CCI LC datasets. In comparison with the merged 2005 and 2009 GlobCover dataset, the cropland overlaps range from 38.9% to 85.0%. This demonstrates that the choice of land cover dataset can have a significant impact on a spatial assessment. Results from this assessment demonstrate that only a small fraction of vulnerable agricultural soils across the region may be a risk for contamination by acetochlor of groundwater or surface resources, based on product label recommendations. Given the availability of spatial data in a region, the methods contained herein may additionally be used in other localities to provide similar information that can be helpful for water quality management."
https://openalex.org/W3023411929,"The sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of bacteriophages infecting mycobacteria has yielded a large amount of information on their evolution, including that on their environmental propagation on other genera such as Gordonia, closely related to Mycobacterium. However, little is known on mycobacteriophages cell biology such as the nature of their receptor(s) or their replication cycle. As part of our on-going screening for novel mycobacteriophages, we herein report the isolation and genome bioinformatics analysis of Weirdo19ES, a singleton Siphoviridae temperate mycobacteriophage with a 70.19% GC content. Nucleotide and protein sequence comparison to actinobacteriophage databases revealed that Weirdo19ES shows low homology to Gordonia phage Ruthy and mycobacteriophages falling in clusters Q and G and to singleton DS6A.Weirdo19ES also displays uncommon features such as a very short Lysin A gene (with only one enzymatic domain) and two putative HNH endonucleases. Mycobacterium smegmatis mutants resistant to Weirdo19ES are cross- resistant to I3. In agreement with that phenotype, analysis of cell envelope of those mutants showed that Weirdo19ES shares receptors with the transducing mycobacteriophage I3.This singleton mycobacteriophage adds up to the uncommonness of local mycobacteriophages previously isolated by our group and helps understanding the nature of mycobacteriophage receptors."
https://openalex.org/W3021365163,"Background Cortisol has been used to capture psychophysiological stress during childbirth and postpartum wellbeing. We explored the effect of a brief antenatal training course in self-hypnosis on salivary cortisol during childbirth and 6 weeks postpartum. Methods In a randomized, controlled trial conducted at Aarhus University Hospital Skejby Denmark during the period January 2010 until October 2010, a total of 349 healthy nulliparous women were included. They were randomly allocated to a hypnosis group (n = 136) receiving three one-hour lessons in self-hypnosis with additional audio-recordings, a relaxation group (n = 134) receiving three one-hour lessons in various relaxation methods with audio-recordings for additional training, and a usual care group (n = 79) receiving ordinary antenatal care only. Salivary cortisol samples were collected during childbirth (at the beginning of the pushing state, 30 minutes, and 2 hours after childbirth), and 6 weeks postpartum (at wake up, 30 minutes after wake up, and evening). Cortisol concentrations were compared using a linear mixed-effects model. Correlations between cortisol concentrations and length of birth, experienced pain and calmness during birth were examined by a Spearman rank correlation test. Findings During childbirth, week correlations were found between cortisol concentrations 30 minutes after childbirth and length of birth. In the beginning of the pushing state and 2 hours after childbirth, we found a tendency towards higher cortisol concentrations in the hypnosis group compared to the other two groups (hypnosis versus relaxation p = 0.02 and 0.03, hypnosis versus usual care p = 0.08 and 0.05). No differences were observed in cortisol concentrations between the groups 30 minutes after childbirth (hypnosis versus relaxation p = 0.08, hypnosis versus usual care 0.10) or 6 weeks postpartum (hypnosis versus relaxation: p = 0.85, 0.51, and 0.68, hypnosis versus usual care: p = 0.85, 0.93, and 0.96). Conclusion Antenatal hypnosis training may increase the release of cortisol during childbirth with no long-term consequences. Further research is needed to help interpret these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3022014709,"Most of South Africa’s energy is derived from the combustion of coal in pulverized coal-fired power plants (CFPP). However, when compared with the rest of the world, limited information regarding the main radioactive elements (U and Th) and specific radionuclides of interest (K40, Ra226 and Th232) from South African CFPP is available in the public domain. This paper aims to quantify the U, Th and specific radionuclides found in the coal used in selected South African CFPP in comparison to world averages found in literature. The U and Th concentrations were obtained by ICP-MS. The main radionuclides, K40, Ra226 and Th238, were quantified using gamma spectrometry. The U concentration and Th concentrations for the coal used in all the power plants was above the world average of 1.9 mg/kg and 3.2 mg/kg respectively. The coals with the highest Th content originated from the Mpumalanga power plant, while the U content in the Freestate power plant samples was the highest of the three. The concentrations of the K40 were between 88.43±10.75–110.76±8.92 Bq/kg, which are in-line with world averages of 4–785 Bq/kg. Similarly, the Ra226 and Th232 values were between 21.69±2.83–52.63±4.04 Bq/kg and 19.91±1.24–22.97±1.75 Bq/kg respectively, which are also in line with the world averages of 1–206 Bq/kg and 1–170 Bq/kg respectively. Radiological hazard indices such as radium equivalent (Raeq); external hazard index (Hex) and internal hazard index (Hin), that were estimated from these average radionuclide concentrations were less than the prescribed values found in literature. This indicated that no significant health risk was posed by the coal being used from these coal fields."
https://openalex.org/W3023714164,"We sought to evaluate the relationship between adult body height and risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) among healthy Koreans using nationwide population-based data. We analyzed data derived from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008–2011. Participants over 40 years of age were included in the sample after excluding individuals with systemic comorbidities or missing relevant data. The presence and severity of AMD were graded using fundus photographs. The relationship between body height and risk of AMD was determined using multiple logistic regression analyses. Among a total of 8,435 participants, 544 (6.45%) had AMD: 502 (5.95%) with early AMD and 42 (0.5%) with late AMD. In multivariate-adjusted analyses, taller body height was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of AMD (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81–0.99), while body mass index (BMI) was not associated with AMD. An inverse association between body height and risk of AMD was observed most frequently in participants under 65 years of age (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70–0.94). Furthermore, body height showed an inverse association with risk of AMD among obese participants (BMI ≥25.0 kg/m2) (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60–0.93). Subgroup analysis by AMD type disclosed a significant inverse association between body height and early AMD (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79–0.97) but not late AMD. Our results suggest that shorter body height is independently associated with increased risk of AMD, especially early AMD, in a dose-response manner in people who are obese or under 65 years of age."
https://openalex.org/W3023483737,Electrical defibrillation is a well-established treatment for cardiac dysrhythmias. Studies have suggested that shock-induced spatial sawtooth patterns and virtual electrodes are responsible for defibrillation efficacy. We hypothesize that high-frequency shocks enhance defibrillation efficacy by generating temporal sawtooth patterns and using rapid virtual electrodes synchronized with shock frequency. High-speed optical mapping was performed on isolated rat hearts at 2000 frames/s. Two defibrillation electrodes were placed on opposite sides of the ventricles. An S1-S2 pacing protocol was used to induce ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VTA). High-frequency shocks of equal energy but varying frequencies of 125-1000 Hz were used to evaluate VTA vulnerability and defibrillation success rate. The 1000-Hz shock had the highest VTA induction rate in the shorter S1-S2 intervals (50 and 100 ms) and the highest VTA defibrillation rate (70%) among all frequencies. Temporal sawtooth patterns and synchronous shock-induced virtual electrode responses could be observed with frequencies of up to 1000 Hz. The improved defibrillation outcome with high-frequency shocks suggests a lower energy requirement than that of low-frequency shocks for successful ventricular defibrillation.
https://openalex.org/W3021468410,"Though digital images and real objects are represented differently at a neural level and can evoke different behaviours, little work has directly compared the magnitude of social effects on real and digitally represented stimuli. Object-directed reaches are modified in the near space of others, while image-directed reaches are not, but the exact role of the presence versus location of the other person is unknown (Dosso and Kingstone, 2018). The present work probed the unique contribution of social presence (a passive observer) in shaping object- and image-directed reaching behaviour. In a shape-matching game, movements were performed more slowly and less efficiently when participants were observed by the experimenter, regardless of whether participants handled real objects or digital images. Our finding that social presence affects real- and image-directed reaches similarly supports the continued use of computer-generated objects to approximate human behaviour towards real objects when social effects on object-directed actions are studied."
https://openalex.org/W3021583682,"Cellular identity and behavior is controlled by complex gene regulatory networks. Transcription factors (TFs) bind to specific DNA sequences to regulate the transcription of their target genes. On the basis of these TF motifs in cis-regulatory elements we can model the influence of TFs on gene expression. In such models of TF motif activity the data is usually modeled assuming a linear relationship between the motif activity and the gene expression level. A commonly used method to model motif influence is based on Ridge Regression. One important assumption of linear regression is the independence between samples. However, if samples are generated from the same cell line, tissue, or other biological source, this assumption may be invalid. This same assumption of independence is also applied to different yet similar experimental conditions, which may also be inappropriate. In theory, the independence assumption between samples could lead to loss in signal detection. Here we investigate whether a Bayesian model that allows for correlations results in more accurate inference of motif activities.We extend the Ridge Regression to a Bayesian Linear Mixed Model, which allows us to model dependence between different samples. In a simulation study, we investigate the differences between the two model assumptions. We show that our Bayesian Linear Mixed Model implementation outperforms Ridge Regression in a simulation scenario where the noise, which is the signal that can not be explained by TF motifs, is uncorrelated. However, we demonstrate that there is no such gain in performance if the noise has a similar covariance structure over samples as the signal that can be explained by motifs. We give a mathematical explanation to why this is the case. Using four representative real datasets we show that at most ∼â€‹40% of the signal is explained by motifs using the linear model. With these data there is no advantage to using the Bayesian Linear Mixed Model, due to the similarity of the covariance structure.The project implementation is available at https://github.com/Sim19/SimGEXPwMotifs."
