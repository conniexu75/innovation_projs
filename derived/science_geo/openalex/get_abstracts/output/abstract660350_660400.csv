https://openalex.org/W3048775784,"SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells will likely prove critical for long-term immune protection against COVID-19. Here, we systematically mapped the functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in unexposed individuals, exposed family members, and individuals with acute or convalescent COVID-19. Acute-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative exposed family members and convalescent individuals with a history of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits broadly directed and functionally replete memory T cell responses, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3083130172,"SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite recent advances in the structural elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, the detailed architecture of the intact virus remains to be unveiled. Here we report the molecular assembly of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus using cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA). Native structures of the S proteins in pre- and postfusion conformations were determined to average resolutions of 8.7–11 Å. Compositions of the N-linked glycans from the native spikes were analyzed by mass spectrometry, which revealed overall processing states of the native glycans highly similar to that of the recombinant glycoprotein glycans. The native conformation of the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and their higher-order assemblies were revealed. Overall, these characterizations revealed the architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in exceptional detail and shed light on how the virus packs its ∼30-kb-long single-segmented RNA in the ∼80-nm-diameter lumen."

Analysis of ∼212,000 cells representing human fetal, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and mouse liver revealed remarkable fetal-like reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, the HCC ecosystem displayed features reminiscent of fetal development, including re-emergence of fetal-associated endothelial cells (PLVAP/VEGFR2) and fetal-like (FOLR2) tumor-associated macrophages. In a cross-species comparative analysis, we discovered remarkable similarity between mouse embryonic, fetal-liver, and tumor macrophages. Spatial transcriptomics further revealed a shared onco-fetal ecosystem between fetal liver and HCC. Furthermore, gene regulatory analysis, spatial transcriptomics, and in vitro functional assays implicated VEGF and NOTCH signaling in maintaining onco-fetal ecosystem. Taken together, we report a shared immunosuppressive onco-fetal ecosystem in fetal liver and HCC. Our results unravel a previously unexplored onco-fetal reprogramming of the tumor ecosystem, provide novel targets for therapeutic interventions in HCC, and open avenues for identifying similar paradigms in other cancers and disease.

Liver plays an essential role in human physiology, from serving as the predominant site of early fetal hematopoiesis (Christensen et al., 2004Christensen J.L. Wright D.E. Wagers A.J. Weissman I.L. Circulation and chemotaxis of fetal hematopoietic stem cells.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E75Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) to being a key metabolic regulator of dietary nutrients, including lipids, sugars, and proteins through adult homeostasis (Rui, 2014Rui L. Comprehensive Physiology.Compr. Physiol. 2014; 4: 177-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Therefore, liver dysfunctions can result in several life-threatening conditions, including NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which altogether account for ∼2 million deaths per year (Williams et al., 2014Williams R. Aspinall R. Bellis M. Camps-Walsh G. Cramp M. Dhawan A. Ferguson J. Forton D. Foster G. Gilmore I. et al.Addressing liver disease in the UK: a blueprint for attaining excellence in health care and reducing premature mortality from lifestyle issues of excess consumption of alcohol, obesity, and viral hepatitis.Lancet. 2014; 384: 1953-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Liver is unique for its remarkable regenerative potential, which helps in overcoming acute injury and in maintaining the integrity of the hepatobiliary system. Liver injury and subsequent inflammatory responses serves as a signal for regeneration (Forbes and Newsome, 2016Forbes S.J. Newsome P.N. Liver regeneration - mechanisms and models to clinical application.Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2016; 13: 473-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, severe liver injury or loss of regenerative potential could lead to irreparable damage. Liver diseases are mainly induced by dietary (drugs/alcohol) or viral (hepatitis A/B/C) factors resulting in fatty liver, cirrhosis, and eventually carcinomas (Williams et al., 2014Williams R. Aspinall R. Bellis M. Camps-Walsh G. Cramp M. Dhawan A. Ferguson J. Forton D. Foster G. Gilmore I. et al.Addressing liver disease in the UK: a blueprint for attaining excellence in health care and reducing premature mortality from lifestyle issues of excess consumption of alcohol, obesity, and viral hepatitis.Lancet. 2014; 384: 1953-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Among these, HCC is the second most prevalent cause of cancer-associated mortalities worldwide (Yang et al., 2019Yang J.D. Hainaut P. Gores G.J. Amadou A. Plymoth A. Roberts L.R. A global view of hepatocellular carcinoma: trends, risk, prevention and management.Nat. Rev. Gastroentero. Hepatol. 2019; 16: 589-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Early-stage HCC may be treated with surgical resection or organ transplantation and advanced disease by systemic therapy; however, treatment is associated with high overall relapse rates (Bruix and Sherman, 2011Bruix J. Sherman M. Management of hepatocellular carcinoma: an update.Hepatology. 2011; 53: 1020-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar). Tumors comprise diverse cell types, and there exists a constant “arms race” between the immune system and transformed cells (Tabassum and Polyak, 2015Tabassum D.P. Polyak K. Tumorigenesis: it takes a village.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). These interactions lead to either the elimination or successful colonization of tumor cells. A favorable tumor ecosystem allows malignant cells to survive nutrient deprivation and immunological selection pressures. Notably, different regions of tumor could represent heterogeneity in the tumor ecosystem constituting distinct tumor, stromal, and immune cell types (McGranahan and Swanton, 2017McGranahan N. Swanton C. Clonal Heterogeneity and Tumor Evolution: Past, Present, and the Future.Cell. 2017; 168: 613-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar; Smith and Hodges, 2019Smith E.A. Hodges H.C. The Spatial and Genomic Hierarchy of Tumor Ecosystems Revealed by Single-Cell Technologies.Trends Cancer. 2019; 5: 411-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This regional intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) could foster variability in cell-cell interactions. Moreover, heterogeneity of tumor ecosystem cells such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), endothelial cells (ECs), and immune cells could further impact the therapeutic responses in the clinic. However, a systematic study defining the transcriptomic, spatial, and functional landscape of ITH and the resultant unique cell-cell interactions in the HCC ecosystem has remained elusive. Tumor cells are known to exhibit phenotypic plasticity, which facilitates the cellular diversity and tumor evolution (Cassetta et al., 2019Cassetta L. Fragkogianni S. Sims A.H. Swierczak A. Forrester L.M. Zhang H. Soong D.Y.H. Cotechini T. Anur P.

Chong F.T. et al.Longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing of patient-derived primary cells reveals drug-induced infidelity in stem cell hierarchy.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Documented similarities between embryonic development and tumorigenesis have given credence to the notion that tumor cells can reprogram and/or transdifferentiate into cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) (Clevers, 2011Clevers H. The cancer stem cell: premises, promises and challenges.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Additionally, some malignant cells are known to express antigens specific to fetal development, a classic example being the expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in HCC (Behne and Copur, 2012Behne T. Copur M.S. Biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma.Int. J. Hepatol. 2012; 2012: 859076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies link phenotypic characteristics of malignant cells with early developmental programs. However, the ability of the tumor ecosystem to recapitulate early developmental hallmarks remains to be investigated. In this study, we set out to generate a comprehensive atlas of human liver encompassing fetal development, adult homeostasis, and carcinoma. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand liver biology and its implications in human disease. Here, we comprehensively profiled ∼212,000 single cells across human fetal liver (∼60,000), HCC (adjacent normal ∼16,500; tumor ∼57,200), and mouse models (∼79,000). We report ∼30 major clusters from fetal, adjacent normal, and tumor tissues, representing diverse cell types in human liver. Importantly, through systematic interrogations of transcriptional profiles, cellular interactions, gene regulatory networks, and spatial transcriptomics, we present a comparative analyses of liver development and cancer. This lead to identification of a novel immune-suppressive “onco-fetal ecosystem” in HCC, comprising shared stromal and immune cell types as well as signaling components in fetal liver and HCC. Furthermore, we employed a state-of-the-art genetic lineage tracing mouse model to establish the ontogeny of various TAM sub-populations in HCC. Our in vitro cell-cell interaction and spatial transcriptomics analysis provided further insights into cellular communications that facilitate the immunosuppressive onco-fetal reprogramming of the tumor ecosystem. Taken together, our work provides a new paradigm of immunosuppressive onco-fetal tumor microenvironment (TME) via VEGF/NOTCH signaling in HCC. To understand the complexity of tumor ecosystem and dynamic reciprocal interactions between malignant, stromal, and immune cells in HCC, we employed a droplet-based single-cell transcriptomics approach (10× chromium). HCC is mainly driven by viral or metabolic factors (Villanueva, 2019Villanueva A. Hepatocellular Carcinoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 2019; 380: 1450-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar); we included both viral positive (chronic hepatitis B) and negative tumors in our study. Additionally, in order to generate a comprehensive single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas of spatial ITH, we sampled tumor tissues from multiple sectors of surgically resected HCC with clearly demarcated core and peripheral regions (Zhai et al., 2017Zhai W. Lim T.K.-H. Zhang T. Phang S.-T. Tiang Z. Guan P. Ng M.-H. Lim J.Q. Yao F. Li Z. et al.The spatial organization of intra-tumour heterogeneity and evolutionary trajectories of metastases in hepatocellular carcinoma.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As reference, we profiled both tumor adjacent “normal” tissues as well as one “healthy normal” obtained from a liver transplant donor. Since most tissue dissociation protocols adversely affect the recovery of non-immune cells (Aizarani et al., 2019Aizarani N. Saviano A. Sagar Mailly L. Durand S. Herman J.S. Pessaux P. Baumert T.F. Grün D. A human liver cell atlas reveals heterogeneity and epithelial progenitors.Nature. 2019; 572: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar; MacParland et al., 2018MacParland S.A. Liu J.C. Ma X.-Z. Innes B.T. Bartczak A.M. Gage B.K. Manuel J. Khuu N. Echeverri J. Linares I. et al.Single cell RNA sequencing of human liver reveals distinct intrahepatic macrophage populations.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), we enriched these cells by magnetic sorting of CD45+ and CD45– cells followed by 1:1 mixing before single-cell droplet generation (Figure 1A). First, we analyzed ∼74,000 cells (∼2,600 genes/cell) obtained from 57 sectors, from 14 HCC patients (5 HepB– and 9 HepB+) as well as one healthy donor (Figures 1A–1F, S1A, and S1B; Table S1). Louvain clustering of these cells identified 29 distinct major clusters representing epithelial, immune, endothelial, and fibroblast populations (Figures 1B and 1F). Next, we employed lineage-specific markers to annotate Louvain clusters into major cell types of the liver, including B cells (MZB1; CD79A), T cells (CD3E; IL7R; CD8), NK (natural killer; GNLY; NKG7), myeloid (LYZ; CD14), fibroblast (ACTA2; THY1), endothelial (PECAM1; Von Willebrand factor [VWF]), and hepatocyte (ALB+; KRT8+) cells (Figure 1B). In total, we identified one cluster (cl.) each of fibroblasts (cl. 13), bi-potent progenitors (cl. 24), B (cl. 18), mast cells (cl. 28), and Tregs (cl. 12); two of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (cl. 3, 4); three of CD4+ T-helper cells (cl. 0, 5, 23) and myeloid cells (cl. 8, 10, 19); four of NK/NKT (cl. 1, 9, 15, 22); five of ECs (cl. 2, 6, 17, 26, 27); and seven of hepatocytes (cl. 7, 11, 14, 16, 20, 21, 25) (Figure 1B; Table S2).Figure S1A Multi-sector Single-Cell Atlas of HCC, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) UMAP colored by individual sector ID,(B) bar graph represents number of cells from each sector (HN- healthy normal; P- patient) and(C) Proportion bar graph represent cluster frequency in Viral Positive versus Viral Negative patients.

Interestingly, we observed tumor and adjacent normal-specific clustering of certain cell types indicating potential remodeling of TME in HCC. We also discovered distinct endothelial and lymphoid cells as well as macrophages in the tumor core, periphery, and adjacent normal tissue (Figure 1C). Notably, we found fetal-liver-associated PLVAP+ ECs (Rantakari et al., 2016Rantakari P. Jäppinen N. Lokka E. Mokkala E. Gerke H. Peuhu E. Ivaska J. Elima K. Auvinen K. Salmi M. Fetal liver endothelium regulates the seeding of tissue-resident macrophages.Nature. 2016; 538: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), CD163+ macrophages, and TIGIT+ Treg cells were specifically enriched in tumor tissues, while cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NKT cells were predominantly present in the adjacent normal tissue (Figures 1C and S1D–S1H). In concordance with Zhang et al., 2019Zhang Q. He Y. Luo N. Patel S.J. Han Y. Gao R. Modak M. Carotta S. Haslinger C. Kind D. et al.Landscape and Dynamics of Single Immune Cells in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Cell. 2019; 179: 829-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, we also observed a lack of any specific immune cell population in viral positive and negative tumors, indicating convergence of a “tumor phenotype” in both types of HCCs (Figures 1E and S1C). Based on top differentially expressed genes, we identified unique markers for each of the 29 major clusters (Figure 1G; Table S3) and employed machine-learning algorithm “Garnett” (Pliner et al., 2019Pliner H.A. Shendure J. Trapnell C. Supervised classification enables rapid annotation of cell atlases.Nat. Methods. 2019; 16: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to assign signatures to each cluster. This allowed us to develop a cluster-agnostic approach for cell-type annotation (Figures 1H and S1I). Overall, our comprehensive analysis of ∼74,000 single cells from normal and tumor tissue of the human liver provides an unprecedented opportunity to compare this atlas with other liver datasets (Aizarani et al., 2019Aizarani N. Saviano A. Sagar Mailly L. Durand S. Herman J.S. Pessaux P. Baumert T.F. Grün D.

Since we observed remarkable divergence between normal and tumor ecosystems, we set out to identify disease-specific cell types in further depth. We subdivided major clusters into T cells, NK/NKT cells, B cells, myeloid cells, ECs, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes followed by re-clustering of these cells types. Sub-clustering of T cells led to the identification of 20 clusters (Figure S2A). Interestingly, while there was a distinct enrichment of naive and regulatory CD4+ cells within the tumor, they noticeably lacked cytotoxic CD8+ cells, a classic hallmark of “non-inflamed” or “cold” (Lambrechts et al., 2018Lambrechts D. Wauters E. Boeckx B. Aibar S. Nittner D. Burton O. Bassez A. Decaluwé H. Pircher A. Van den Eynde K. et al.Phenotype molding of stromal cells in the lung tumor microenvironment.Nat.

Van den Eynde K. et al.Phenotype molding of stromal cells in the lung tumor microenvironment.Nat. Med. 2018; 24: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) (Figure S2A). We further analyzed the frequencies of individual patient samples in each of the clusters, and tumor specificity followed by identification of cluster-specific markers (Figures S2B and S2C). Sub-clustering of NK cells led to identification of 10 clusters dividing NK cells into CD56Bright, KLRC2+ (adaptive), and KLRC1+ (educated) populations (Figures S2D–S2I). In addition, we also identified a cluster of NKT cells. The CD56Bright NK and NKT cells were specifically enriched in adjacent normal tissue, while tumor-infiltrating NK cells expressed KLRC1 and KLRC2, markers associated with memory-like NK cell (Ram et al., 2018Ram D.R. Manickam C. Hueber B. Itell H.L. Permar S.R. Varner V. Reeves R.K. Tracking KLRC2 (NKG2C)+ memory-like NK cells in SIV+ and rhCMV+ rhesus macaques.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14: e1007104Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Figures S2E and S2F). Intriguingly, we identified previously unknown KRT81, KRT86, and MYOM2 positive NK cell populations (Figures S2E–S2I). Further investigations are warranted to understand the function of these new NK cell populations in the liver. Sub-clustering of fibroblasts identified 9 clusters clearly delineating normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The CAFs in HCC expressed MYH11, ACTA2, THY1, and TAGLN, markers typically associated with activated fibroblasts (Figures S2J–S2M). Clustering of epithelial cells identified 13 hepatocyte (ALB+) and one bi-potent (KRT8+/KRT19+) clusters (Figure S2N). Interestingly, bi-potent cells were specific to normal tissue and were present in all individuals (Figures S2N–S2Q). In concordance with the recently published head and neck (Puram et al., 2017Puram S.V. Tirosh I. Parikh A.S. Patel A.P. Yizhak K. Gillespie S. Rodman C. Luo C.L. Mroz E.A.

Nonetheless, the hepatocytes from multiple patients could be broadly clustered into four major populations of SOX4+, SPINK1+, MALAT1+, and MALAT1+/NEAT1+ cells (Figures S2O–S2Q). These subpopulations were present in more than one patient, indicating shared molecular signatures in the tumor epithelium. Among the major clusters obtained from single-cell liver atlas, the two cell types that were found to be strikingly different between tumor and adjacent normal tissues are ECs and macrophages. Therefore, we re-analyzed ECs and myeloid subpopulations by sub-clustering. A total of 11,672 ECs formed 11 clusters (Figure 2A), and, apart from the TFF3+ lymphatic ECs, all other cell types were specific to either normal or tumor tissues (Figures 2B and S3A–S3C). Specifically, PLPP3+, IGFBP3+, and PLVAP+ ECs were enriched in the tumor tissue. Among these, plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP) is known to play an important role in liver development and disease (Ramachandran et al., 2019Ramachandran P. Dobie R. Wilson-Kanamori J.R. Dora E.F. Henderson B.E.P. Luu N.T. Portman J.R. Matchett K.P. Brice M.

Interestingly, based on expression of VEGFR2, NRP1 (cl. 3), ACKR1 (cl. 9), and HLA-DR (cl. 4), we observed three HCC-specific clusters of PLVAP+ ECs (Figures 2C). Further, to identify the possible origin of tumor-specific PLVAP+ ECs, we performed RNA velocity analysis (La Manno et al., 2018La Manno G. Soldatov R. Zeisel A. Braun E. Hochgerner H. Petukhov V. Lidschreiber K. Kastriti M.E. Lönnerberg P. Furlan A. et al.RNA velocity of single cells.Nature. 2018; 560: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W3087249954,"A hallmark of severe COVID-19 pneumonia is SARS-CoV-2 infection of the facultative progenitors of lung alveoli, the alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT2s). However, inability to access these cells from patients, particularly at early stages of disease, limits an understanding of disease inception. Here, we present an in vitro human model that simulates the initial apical infection of alveolar epithelium with SARS-CoV-2 by using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived AT2s that have been adapted to air-liquid interface culture. We find a rapid transcriptomic change in infected cells, characterized by a shift to an inflammatory phenotype with upregulation of NF-κB signaling and loss of the mature alveolar program. Drug testing confirms the efficacy of remdesivir as well as TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating a putative mechanism used for viral entry in alveolar cells. Our model system reveals cell-intrinsic responses of a key lung target cell to SARS-CoV-2 infection and should facilitate drug development."

Memory formation in the brain is associated with synaptic remodeling, but how this affects PAPs and therefore extrasynaptic glutamate actions is poorly understood. Here, we used advanced imaging methods, in situ and in vivo, to find that a classical synaptic memory mechanism, long-term potentiation (LTP), triggers withdrawal of PAPs from potentiated synapses. Optical glutamate sensors combined with patch-clamp and 3D molecular localization reveal that LTP induction thus prompts spatial retreat of astroglial glutamate transporters, boosting glutamate spillover and NMDA-receptor-mediated inter-synaptic cross-talk. The LTP-triggered PAP withdrawal involves NKCC1 transporters and the actin-controlling protein cofilin but does not depend on major Ca2+-dependent cascades in astrocytes. We have therefore uncovered a mechanism by which a memory trace at one synapse could alter signal handling by multiple neighboring connections.

The surface of brain astroglia is packed with high-affinity GLT1 transporters that rapidly take up glutamate released by excitatory synapses (Danbolt, 2001Danbolt N.C. Glutamate uptake.Prog.

However, extrasynaptic glutamate escape, or “spillover,” can have a significant physiological impact. In the hippocampus, glutamate spillover has been causally related to a co-operative action of dendritic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) (Chalifoux and Carter, 2011Chalifoux J.R. Carter A.G.

However, whether the PAP-controlled glutamate spillover can be adaptively regulated by neural activity has remained unknown. Astrocytes can generate molecular signals that regulate excitatory transmission (Araque et al., 2014Araque A. Carmignoto G. Haydon P.G. Oliet S.H. Robitaille R. Volterra A.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 10143-10153Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Whether PAPs can also undergo activity-dependent remodeling has therefore been a long-standing question. Electron microscopy (EM) studies have reported increased astroglial coverage of synaptic samples that underwent induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) (Bernardinelli et al., 2014Bernardinelli Y.

Greenough W.T. Ultrastructural evidence for increased contact between astrocytes and synapses in rats reared in a complex environment.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 1996; 65: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In contrast, synaptic coverage by PAPs decreased following memory consolidation (Ostroff et al., 2014Ostroff L.E. Manzur M.K. Cain C.K. Ledoux J.E. Synapses lacking astrocyte appear in the amygdala during consolidation of Pavlovian threat conditioning.J. Comp. Neurol. 2014; 522: 2152-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or during lactation (Oliet et al., 2001Oliet S.H.R. Piet R. Poulain D.A. Control of glutamate clearance and synaptic efficacy by glial coverage of neurons.Science. 2001; 292: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, EM cannot follow morphogenic events in time and might be prone to distortions of PAP morphology during tissue fixation (Korogod et al., 2015Korogod N. Petersen C.C.H. Knott G.W. Ultrastructural analysis of adult mouse neocortex comparing aldehyde perfusion with cryo fixation.eLife. 2015; 4: e05793Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These factors necessitate evidence in live cells, which has been a challenge because of the nanoscopic size of PAPs. Several studies have elegantly used confocal or two-photon excitation (2PE) fluorescence microscopy to monitor fine changes in PAPs (Bernardinelli et al., 2014Bernardinelli Y. Randall J. Janett E. Nikonenko I. König S. Jones E.V. Flores C.E. Murai K.K. Bochet C.G. Holtmaat A. Muller D.

Structural and functional plasticity of astrocyte processes and dendritic spine interactions.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 12738-12744Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, dynamic fluorescent shapes seen in a light microscope are subject to interpretation. First, PAPs and inter-PAP distances are beyond the light diffraction limit, potentially giving rise to spurious shapes (Rusakov, 2015Rusakov D.A. Disentangling calcium-driven astrocyte physiology.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 16: 226-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, cell-permeable fluorescent tracers appear to underreport astroglial structure (Reeves et al., 2011Reeves A.M. Shigetomi E. Khakh B.S. Bulk loading of calcium indicator dyes to study astrocyte physiology: key limitations and improvements using morphological maps.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 9353-9358Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Finally, subtle re-distribution of the fluorescent label could be mistaken for changes in PAP shape or motility. To avoid such uncertainties, we set out to monitor PAPs with microscopy methods that are not limited by diffraction of light, under several LTP induction protocols, in hippocampal slices and in the barrel cortex in vivo. We employed optical glutamate sensors to relate LTP-associated changes in PAPs to extrasynaptic glutamate escape. We identified key players in cell signaling cascades that could underpin such changes. The results thus unveil how a plasticity-inducing pattern of neural activity could trigger local PAP remodeling thus altering local rules of synaptic signal integration. First, we visualized astrocytes loaded whole-cell with Alexa Fluor 594 (AF 594), in CA1 s. radiatum of acute hippocampal slices, using 2PE. Here, fluorescence intensity FROI inside an ∼1 μm focal plane over an x-y region of interest (ROI), scales with the tissue volume fraction (VF) occupied by the dye-filled PAPs (Figure 1A, left). Because astrocyte territories do not overlap (Bushong et al., 2002Bushong E.A. Martone M.E. Jones Y.Z. Ellisman M.H. Protoplasmic astrocytes in CA1 stratum radiatum occupy separate anatomical domains.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), FROI represents all astroglia within the ROI. Thus, relating FROI to the fluorescence intensity FS over the somatic region representing 100% VF (Figures 1A, right, S1A, and S1B) provides the local PAP VF readout, as detailed previously (Medvedev et al., 2014Medvedev N. Popov V. Henneberger C. Kraev I. Rusakov D.A. Stewart M.G. Glia selectively approach synapses on thin dendritic spines.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Rusakov D.A. Disentangling astroglial physiology with a realistic cell model in silico.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This readout gave average PAP VF of 6%–7% (cell bodies excluded), with or without gap junctions blocked (Figures S1B and S1C). A similar value was reported previously in area CA1 (Savtchenko et al., 2018Savtchenko L.P. Bard L. Jensen T.P. Reynolds J.P. Kraev I. Medvedev N. Stewart M.G. Henneberger C. Rusakov D.A. Disentangling astroglial physiology with a realistic cell model in silico.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or dentate gyrus (Medvedev et al., 2014Medvedev N. Popov V. Henneberger C. Kraev I. Rusakov D.A. Stewart M.G. Glia selectively approach synapses on thin dendritic spines.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2014; 369: 20140047Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and was in line with earlier EM data (Lehre and Rusakov, 2002Lehre K.P. Rusakov D.A. Asymmetry of glia near central synapses favors presynaptically directed glutamate escape.Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Patrushev et al., 2013Patrushev I. Gavrilov N. Turlapov V. Semyanov A. Subcellular location of astrocytic calcium stores favors extrasynaptic neuron-astrocyte communication.Cell Calcium. 2013; 54: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Next, we induced LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses, with the classical protocol of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) applied to Schaffer collaterals, while monitoring PAP VF and local fEPSPs (Henneberger et al., 2010Henneberger C. Papouin T. Oliet S.H. Rusakov D.A. Long-term potentiation depends on release of D-serine from astrocytes.Nature. 2010; 463: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar) (Figures 1B and 1C; STAR Methods). LTP induction prompted a gradual PAP VF decrease, with a time constant of ∼14 min and a projected steady-state value of ∼23% (Figure 1D; Video S1). No VF change occurred in control conditions (Figure 1D), ruling out confounding effects, such as dye photobleaching. Interestingly, ROIs with smaller initial PAP VF showed a stronger VF reduction (Figure 1E). Similar tests using EGFP-expressing astroglia showed a smaller effect, most likely due to restricted diffusion of EGFP compared to small AF 594 molecules, and no VF changes were detected after the induction of long-term depression (Figures S1D and S1E). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/03619945-e784-4533-8c68-e28349b368bc/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

Monitoring Volume Fraction of Astrocyte Processes during LTP Induction in Bulk, Related to Figure 1Time-lapse series, example of an astrocyte in area CA1 loaded whole-cell with Alexa Fluor 594 (single optical section, λx2p = 810 nm, original recording at 16 bit gray-level). Two intensity ranges of the same time series are shown (left and right) to illustrate fluorescence time course at the soma (left) and within an example ROI (right, orange rectangle); orange rectangle, example ROI for PAP VF monitoring. The VF decrease was blocked when LTP was suppressed, either by the NMDAR antagonist APV, or by clamping Ca2+ in the recorded astrocyte (Figure 1F) that inhibits astroglia-dependent release of the NMDAR co-agonist D-serine (Henneberger et al., 2010Henneberger C. Papouin T. Oliet S.H. Rusakov D.A. Long-term potentiation depends on release of D-serine from astrocytes.Nature. 2010; 463: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). In the latter test, LTP and VF reduction could be rescued by washing in 10 μM D-serine (Figure 1F), consistent with earlier reports (Adamsky et al., 2018Adamsky A. Kol A. Kreisel T. Doron A. Ozeri-Engelhard N. Melcer T. Refaeli R. Horn H. Regev L.

These results related VF reduction specifically to LTP induction rather than to HFS per se. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of AF 594 can report diffusion coupling among astrocyte processes when the bleaching line-scan is applied in their midst (Figure 1G), as shown earlier (Anders et al., 2014Anders S. Minge D. Griemsmann S. Herde M.K. Steinhäuser C. Henneberger C. Spatial properties of astrocyte gap junction coupling in the rat hippocampus.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Rusakov D.A. Disentangling astroglial physiology with a realistic cell model in silico.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In these tests, LTP induction slowed down FRAP kinetics, with no changes in control conditions (Figures 1H and 1I), suggesting reduced coupling among PAPs, possibly due to their partial shrinkage. At the same time, LTP induction had no effect on extracellular diffusion (Figure 1I) assessed with a fluorescence point-source method (Figures S1F–S1H) (Zheng et al., 2008Zheng K. Scimemi A.

J. 2008; 95: 4584-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This was not surprising because CA1 astroglia occupy, soma excluded, only 6%–7% of the tissue volume (Figure S1C) (Savtchenko et al., 2018Savtchenko L.P. Bard L. Jensen T.P. Reynolds J.P. Kraev I.

Diffusion in brain extracellular space.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 1277-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Thus, a 20%–30% decrease in PAP VF would increase local extracellular space by only 5%–10%. STED microscopy enables monitoring live astroglia beyond the optical diffraction limit (Arizono et al., 2020Arizono M. Inavalli V.V.G.K. Panatier A. Pfeiffer T. Angibaud J. Levet F. Ter Veer M.J.T.

Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2014; 369: 20130597Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We therefore turned to two-color STED (Tønnesen et al., 2018Tønnesen J. Inavalli V.V.G.K. Nägerl U.V. Super-resolution imaging of the extracellular space in living brain tissue.Cell. 2018; 172: 1108-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) combined with patch-clamp (Figures 2A and S2A) in organotypic slices. We used the Thy1-YFP transgenic mice and whole-cell AF 488 dialysis to image, respectively, CA1 pyramidal neurons and PAPs, in separate channels before and ∼20 min after LTP induction, with ∼70 nm x-y resolution (Figure 2A). Again, to avoid subjective judgement, we recorded the volumetric ratio of green-to-red pixels (G/R) within 1.5 μm ROIs centered at individual spine heads (Figure 2A). After LTP induction, G/R decreased by 31% ± 10% (n = 22, p < 0.001) (Figure 2B), thus corroborating results in acute slices (Figures 1A–1F). Stable red-pixel count (Figure 2B) ruled out Thy1-YFP photobleaching whereas AF 488 bleaching was prevented by dialysis. STED images revealed subtle changes in some dendritic spines during LTP (Figure S2B). To explore this further while minimizing STED-induced photodamage, we compared randomized groups of spines. The LTP group had a much smaller fraction of the PAP-contacting spines (Figure 2C), larger heads in the no-PAP-contact spines, and a greater fraction of distinctly large spine heads (>500 nm wide, 12/54) overall, compared to control (3/29, Figures S2C and S2D). To understand further changes on the nanoscale, we turned to correlational 3D EM. We loaded an astrocyte with AF 594 and biocytin (Figure 2D), either in baseline conditions or 15–20 min after LTP induction, followed by rapid slice submersion into fixative and DAB conversion for EM (Figures 2D and 2E; STAR Methods). The embedded slices were cut into 60–70 nm serial sections, the patched astrocyte was located (Figures 2D and 2E), and its fragment with the adjacent synapses were 3D-reconstructed from 200–300 sections (Figures 2F and S2E), as detailed earlier (Medvedev et al., 2014Medvedev N. Popov V. Henneberger C. Kraev I. Rusakov D.A. Stewart M.G. Glia selectively approach synapses on thin dendritic spines.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Rusakov D.A. Disentangling astroglial physiology with a realistic cell model in silico.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To evaluate synaptic PAP coverage volumetrically, we calculated PAP VF inside 100 nm thick concentric spherical shells centered at individual postsynaptic densities (PSDs) (Figure 2G; STAR Methods), up to ∼0.5 μm, the average nearest-neighbor distance between CA3-CA1 synapses. Although “thin” and “mushroom” spines have distinct identities (Matsuzaki et al., 2001Matsuzaki M. Ellis-Davies G.C. Nemoto T. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H.

Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1086-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar), we found that LTP induction reduced local PAP VF for both types (Figure 2H). Here, VF values agreed with the earlier EM data (Lehre and Rusakov, 2002Lehre K.P. Rusakov D.A. Asymmetry of glia near central synapses favors presynaptically directed glutamate escape.Biophys.

To explore cellular mechanisms underlying PAP withdrawal, we first examined major astroglial Ca2+-signaling cascades that engage mGluRs and IP3 receptors (Porter and McCarthy, 1997Porter J.T.

We spot-uncaged IP3 inside cell branches: this evoked local Ca2+ rises (Figures 3A and 3B ) but had no effect on PAP VF (Figure 3C). Puff application of the group I mGluR agonist DHPG had a similar outcome (Figure 3C), and PAP VF remained unaffected by WIN55, an agonist of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor that is active in astroglia (Navarrete and Araque, 2010Navarrete M.

https://openalex.org/W3088289001,"Abstract RNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification. Recent studies on RNA methylation mainly focus on the m 6 A modification of mRNA, but very little is known about the m 5 C modification. NSUN2 is an RNA methyltransferase responsible for the m 5 C modification of multiple RNAs. In this study, we knocked down the NSUN2 gene in HepG2 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and performed high-throughput RNA-BisSeq. An important tumor-related lncRNA H19 was identified to be targeted by NSUN2. Studies have shown that the expression of H19 lncRNA is abnormally elevated and has a carcinogenic effect in many types of tumors. Our results demonstrated that m 5 C modification of H19 lncRNA can increase its stability. Interestingly, m 5 C-modified H19 lncRNA can be specifically bound by G3BP1, a well-known oncoprotein which further leads to MYC accumulation. This may be a novel mechanism by which lncRNA H19 exerts its oncogenic effect. Besides, both the m 5 C methylation level and the expression level of H19 lncRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues were significantly higher than those in adjacent non-cancer tissues, which were closely associated with poor differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In conclusion, we found that H19 RNA is a specific target for the NSUN2 modifier. The m 5 C-modified H19 lncRNA may promote the occurrence and development of tumors by recruiting the G3BP1 oncoprotein. Our findings may provide a potential target and biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W3087912656,"The blood vessels in the central nervous system (CNS) have a series of unique properties, termed the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which stringently regulate the entry of molecules into the brain, thus maintaining proper brain homeostasis. We sought to understand whether neuronal activity could regulate BBB properties. Using both chemogenetics and a volitional behavior paradigm, we identified a core set of brain endothelial genes whose expression is regulated by neuronal activity. In particular, neuronal activity regulates BBB efflux transporter expression and function, which is critical for excluding many small lipophilic molecules from the brain parenchyma. Furthermore, we found that neuronal activity regulates the expression of circadian clock genes within brain endothelial cells, which in turn mediate the activity-dependent control of BBB efflux transport. These results have important clinical implications for CNS drug delivery and clearance of CNS waste products, including Aβ, and for understanding how neuronal activity can modulate diurnal processes."

The present finding may open up new treatment options in severe Covid-19, aiming at reducing the presence and production of hyaluronan in the lungs. The ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has hitherto caused more than 730,000 reported deaths globally (by August 10, 2020, according to Johns Hopkins University). In severe Covid-19, there is a pronounced inflammatory response in the lungs resulting in respiratory failure and potential death, especially among individuals with predisposing chronic diseases or advanced age. The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) has recently been suggested to be a potential cause of fatalities in Covid-19 lung infection (1Shi Y. Wang Y. Shao C. Huang J. Gan J. Huang X. Bucci E. Piacentini M. Ippolito G. Melino G.

Although the nature of this liquid jelly has not yet been determined, HA has been proposed, as it is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1Shi Y. Wang Y. Shao C. Huang J.

Hyaluronan is an important component of all extracellular matrices, and its levels are generally elevated in tissue in response to inflammation and injury (4Nagy N. Kuipers H.F. Frymoyer A.R. Ishak H.D. Bollyky J.B. Wight T.N. Bollyky P.L. 4-Methylumbelliferone treatment and hyaluronan inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer.Front. Immunol. 2015; 6 (25852691): 12310.3389/fimmu.2015.00123Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The HA molecule is highly hygroscopic and has the ability to absorb water up to 1,000 times its molecular weight, which can promote edema (5Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. Fraser J.R. The structure and function of hyaluronan: an overview.Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74 (8724014): A1-A710.1038/icb.1996.32Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Due to its high molecular weight and semiflexible polymer chain, it forms a gel-like fluid with high viscosity causing exclusion properties and barrier functions in tissues (5Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. Fraser J.R. The structure and function of hyaluronan: an overview.Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74 (8724014): A1-A710.1038/icb.1996.32Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). There are also a large number of HA-binding proteins that can involve HA in diverse biological processes (6Day A.J. Prestwich G.D. Hyaluronan-binding proteins: tying up the giant.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (11717315): 4585-458810.1074/jbc.R100036200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). High-molecular weight HA predominates in most tissues under healthy conditions, whereas fragmented low-molecular weight HA polymers predominate at sites of active inflammation (4Nagy N. Kuipers H.F. Frymoyer A.R. Ishak H.D. Bollyky J.B. Wight T.N. Bollyky P.L. 4-Methylumbelliferone treatment and hyaluronan inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer.Front. Immunol. 2015; 6 (25852691): 12310.3389/fimmu.2015.00123Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that HA could be responsible for some of the disease manifestations and mortality in the most severe form of Covid-19 (1Shi Y. Wang Y. Shao C. Huang J. Gan J. Huang X. Bucci E. Piacentini M. Ippolito G. Melino G. COVID-19 infection: the perspectives on immune responses.Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27 (32205856): 1451-145410.1038/s41418-020-0530-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). However, arguments that HA is involved in the pathogenesis of Covid-19 must be verified before new treatment options against the formation of HA can be discussed. Accordingly, the aim of our study was to demonstrate that hyaluronan is present in alveolar spaces in lungs of deceased patients with severe Covid-19. Autopsy lung tissue from the three Covid-19 cases is shown in Fig. 1 (magnification ×20). In two patients, histochemical staining revealed intra-alveolar and interstitial HA localization in the exudative phase (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas the third patient showed the proliferative phase of the Covid-19–associated diffuse alveolar damage (Fig. 1C). The alveolar spaces were filled with exudate and alveolar plugs exhibiting pronounced HA staining. The alveolar walls were hyperplastic and damaged, and HA staining was evident in the thickened perialveolar interstitium (Fig. 2, B–D). In contrast, HA staining was only visible in the alveolar walls and in perivascular tissue in normal lung tissue (Figs. 2A and 3A). The specificity of the staining method for HA is shown in Fig. 3 (B and C). Treatment of the section with hyaluronidase from bovine testes (in Fig. 3C) effectively abolished the HA staining. The pathogenesis of Covid-19 is not fully understood, and there is an urgent need for effective treatments to alleviate the respiratory failure and decrease the case fatality rate in severe disease. This is the first report verifying the presence of HA in the alveolar spaces in lung tissue from three lethal Covid-19 cases. In recent publications of post-mortem findings in Covid-19 lungs (2Xu Z.

Furthermore, it has been shown that the increase in IL-6 in Covid-19–infected patients is associated with the need for mechanical ventilation due to primary respiratory failure and, eventually, with mortality in the disease (12McElvaney O.J.

A recent study has suggested that levels of HA in serum at admission could distinguish critically ill patients with Covid-19 infection (15Ding M. Zhang Q. Li Q. Wu T. Huang Y.Z. Correlation analysis of the severity and clinical prognosis of 32 cases of patients with COVID-19.Respir.

However, increased serum HA levels in Covid-19 patients do not necessarily mean that lung alveoli are filled with HA. Also, previous reports have suggested that a decline in peripheral blood lymphocytes, as well as an increase in peripheral inflammatory factors, such as CRP and IL-6, may be early warning indicators of a poor prognosis for Covid-19 patients (16Yang X. Yu Y. Xu J. Shu H. Xia J. Liu H. Wu Y. Zhang L. Yu Z. Fang M. Yu T. Wang Y. Pan S. Zou X.

The “cytokine storm,” with high levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 β, IL-6, and TNFα) in the lungs of patients with severe Covid-19, implies a close relation to HA, as these cytokines are strong inducers of HA synthase 2 (HAS2) in endothelium, lung alveolar epithelial cells, and fibroblasts (17Wilkinson T.S. Potter-Perigo S. Tsoi C. Altman L.C. Wight T.N. Pro- and anti-inflammatory factors cooperate to control hyaluronan synthesis in lung fibroblasts.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

This fits well with the notion that the state of “hyperinflammation” induces the production and accumulation of HA within the alveolar spaces of patients with severe Covid-19. It has also been shown that HA accumulates in the airways during influenza infection in mice and that HA may be a target for treatment (18Bell T.J. Brand O.J. Morgan D.J. Salek-Ardakani S. Jagger C.

In a recently published study, it was reported that in patients hospitalized due to severe Covid-19 and receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen, anti-inflammatory treatment with dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality (19Horby P.

Whereas corticosteroids in high doses may be more harmful than helpful, beneficial effects of corticosteroid treatment in Covid-19 are suggested to depend on the right dose, at the right time, and in the right patient (19Horby P. Lim W.S. Emberson J.R. Mafham M. Bell J.L. Linsell L. Staplin N. Brightling C. Ustianowski A. Elmahi E. Prudon B. Green C. Felton T. Chadwick D.

In connection with this, it is also interesting to note that corticosteroids are known to be effective in reducing HA levels in bronchoalveolar lavage and circulation (20Ernst G. Lompardía S. Cordo Russo R. Gentilini V. Venturiello S. Galíndez F. Grynblat P. Hajos S.E. Corticosteroid administration reduces the concentration of hyaluronan in bronchoalveolar lavage in a murine model of eosinophilic airway inflammation.Inflamm.

Circulating hyaluronate in rheumatoid arthritis: relationship to inflammatory activity and the effect of corticosteroid therapy.Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1985; 44 (2579613): 83-8810.1136/ard.44.2.83Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The verification of abundant HA in the lungs and, specifically, in alveolar spaces of individuals deceased with the most severe form of Covid-19 thus indicates a possible pathogenetic mechanism behind the hypoxemia and respiratory failure seen in these critically ill patients. A recent synopsis proposed some new possible approaches to the treatment of critically ill Covid-19 patients, among them reducing the presence, or inhibiting the production, of HA in the lungs (1Shi Y. Wang Y. Shao C. Huang J. Gan J. Huang X. Bucci E. Piacentini M. Ippolito G. Melino G. COVID-19 infection: the perspectives on immune responses.Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27 (32205856): 1451-145410.1038/s41418-020-0530-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). However, the article presented no proof at all that HA was present in Covid-19 lungs. Nevertheless, it was suggested that airway inhalation of hyaluronidase would degrade and reduce HA. It is possible that early in the disease, when hypoxemia is developing, inhalation of hyaluronidase could possibly clear the hygroscopic macromolecule from the lungs and facilitate respiration and oxygenation. Experimentally, it has been shown that intranasal administration of exogenous hyaluronidase can reduce lung HA content and restore lung function following influenza infection (18Bell T.J. Brand O.J. Morgan D.J. Salek-Ardakani S. Jagger C. Fujimori T. Cholewa L. Tilakaratna V. Östling J. Thomas M. Day A.J. Snelgrove R.J. Hussell T. Defective lung function following influenza virus is due to prolonged, reversible hyaluronan synthesis.Matrix Biol. 2019; 80 (29933044): 14-2810.1016/j.matbio.2018.06.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan shows a molecular weight–dependent role in regulating inflammation, and HA fragments generated in the course of inflammation might influence the release of inflammatory cytokines (22Petrey A.C. de la Motte C.A. Hyaluronan, a crucial regulator of inflammation.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5 (24653726): 10110.3389/fimmu.2014.00101Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In inflammatory diseases, high-molecular weight HA can also be found in cross-linked complexes (e.g. with inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain and versican) (22Petrey A.C. de la Motte C.A. Hyaluronan, a crucial regulator of inflammation.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5 (24653726): 10110.3389/fimmu.2014.00101Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 23Wight T.N. Kang I. Evanko S.P.

Immunol. 2020; 11 (32265939): 51210.3389/fimmu.2020.00512Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Regardless of size, a degradation of HA by hyaluronidase to smaller oligosaccharide polymers could therefore possibly reduce the ongoing inflammatory reaction in Covid-19. Another suggested option is the clinical use of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) (1Shi Y. Wang Y. Shao C. Huang J. Gan J. Huang X. Bucci E. Piacentini M. Ippolito G. Melino G. COVID-19 infection: the perspectives on immune responses.Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27 (32205856): 1451-145410.1038/s41418-020-0530-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), which can inhibit the production of HA in inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer (4Nagy N. Kuipers H.F. Frymoyer A.R. Ishak H.D. Bollyky J.B. Wight T.N. Bollyky P.L. 4-Methylumbelliferone treatment and hyaluronan inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer.Front. Immunol. 2015; 6 (25852691): 12310.3389/fimmu.2015.00123Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). 4-MU both inhibits the gene expression of two HA synthases (HAS2 and HAS3) and blocks the last stage in the formation of HA from glucose metabolites (24Kultti A. Pasonen-Seppanen S. Jauhiainen M. Rilla K.J. Karna R. Pyoria E. Tammi R.H.

This substance or its chemical derivatives is already used in Chinese medicine, which may explain the observed positive effects of combined herbal therapies in some Covid-19 patients (1Shi Y. Wang Y. Shao C. Huang J. Gan J. Huang X. Bucci E. Piacentini M. Ippolito G. Melino G. COVID-19 infection: the perspectives on immune responses.Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27 (32205856): 1451-145410.1038/s41418-020-0530-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In clinical trials, however, not including Covid-19 patients, 4-MU has been demonstrated safe during short-term administration in approved doses (4Nagy N. Kuipers H.F. Frymoyer A.R. Ishak H.D. Bollyky J.B. Wight T.N. Bollyky P.L. 4-Methylumbelliferone treatment and hyaluronan inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer.Front.

In conclusion, we have for the first time demonstrated a striking presence of hyaluronan in alveolar spaces of the lungs in lethal cases of Covid-19. Based on this novel finding, adjuvant treatment targeting hyaluronan may be a promising approach to reduce mortality in critically ill Covid-19 patients. However, clinical randomized trials are warranted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these substances in the case of severe Covid-19. Lung tissue was obtained at autopsy from three adult Covid-19 positive patients, two males aged 47 and 48 years and one female aged 73 years. Two of the patients had been treated in the intensive care unit, and both of them showed signs of hyperinflammation. For comparison, normal lung tissue was obtained from four patients undergoing thoracic surgery, and the samples were processed in an identical way as the pathological Covid-19 lung tissue. Formaldehyde-fixed (4%) and paraffin-embedded specimens of lung tissue were further processed for HA histochemistry using a direct and specific HA staining method (25Hellstrøm M. Johansson B. Engstrøm-Laurent A. Hyaluronan and its receptor CD44 in the heart of newborn and adult rats.Anat. Rec. A Discov. Mol. Cell Evol. Biol. 2006; 288 (16700028): 587-59210.1002/ar.a.20332Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Sections of lung tissue were incubated with a hyaluronan-binding protein probe, donated by Corgenix (Broomfield, CO, USA). After incubation with Vectastain-Elite Avidin-Biotin complex reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), the HA stainings were developed in a solution of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories). The sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Control slides were preincubated with hyaluronidase from bovine testes (Sigma), a selective HA-digesting enzyme, showing the specificity of the method. All slides were stained simultaneously in the same batch. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority, Dnr. 2020-02204 and 2014/395-31. The ethical approval only allowed for limited clinical information at the time.

Spaceflight-induced potential adverse neurovascular damage and late neurodegeneration are a chief concern. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight on oxidative damage in the mouse brain and its impact on blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Ten-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) for 35 days as part of Space-X 12 mission. Ground control (GC) mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware cages. Within 38 ± 4 hours after returning from the ISS, mice were euthanized and brain tissues were collected for analysis. Quantitative assessment of brain tissue demonstrated that spaceflight caused an up to 2.2-fold increase in apoptosis in the hippocampus compared to the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis of the mouse brain revealed an increased expression of aquaporin4 (AQP4) in the flight hippocampus compared to the controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BBB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). These results indicate a disturbance of BBB integrity. Quantitative proteomic analysis showed significant alterations in pathways responsible for neurovascular integrity, mitochondrial function, neuronal structure, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism in the brain after spaceflight. Changes in pathways associated with adhesion and molecular remodeling were also documented. These data indicate that long-term spaceflight may have pathological and functional consequences associated with neurovascular damage and late neurodegeneration."

The AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca) serves as a paradigm of conformational enzyme repair (Bhat et al., 2017bBhat J.Y. Thieulin-Pardo G.

The diverse AAA+ machines that repair inhibited Rubisco active sites.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4: 31Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The exclusive client of Rca is the photosynthetic key enzyme Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), which is directly or indirectly responsible for all biomass production (Bar-On and Milo, 2019Bar-On Y.M.

Ort D.R. Carbon assimilation in crops at high temperatures.Plant Cell Environ. 2019; 42: 2750-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Rubisco catalyzes the carboxylation of the 5-carbon sugar ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle of photosynthesis. This multistep catalytic reaction produces two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate as fuel for the synthesis of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids. The most prevalent form of Rubisco (form I) in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria is a hexadecamer of eight large (RbcL; ∼50–55 kDa) and eight small (RbcS, ∼12–18 kDa) subunits. The RbcL subunits form a cube-shaped core, consisting of four antiparallel dimers, capped by four RbcS subunits at the top and bottom. Two catalytic sites per RbcL dimer unit are located at the interface between the N-terminal domain of one RbcL and the C-terminal domain of the other subunit. In order to become functionally competent, the RuBP binding site must be activated by carboxylation of the active-site lysine, which results in formation of a carbamate, and is followed by the binding of a Mg2+ ion. This process is commonly referred to as carbamylation (Hartman et al., 1987Hartman F.C. Soper T.S. Niyogi S.K. Mural R.J. Foote R.S. Mitra S. Lee E.H. Machanoff R. Larimer F.W. Function of Lys-166 of Rhodospirillum rubrum ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase as examined by site-directed mutagenesis.J. Biol.

Biochem. 1983; 52: 507-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding of RuBP, the active site is sealed by the so-called “60s loop” from the N-terminal domain of one RbcL subunit and “loop 6” of the C-terminal domain of the adjacent subunit. The N-terminal sequence pins down the 60s loop and the C terminus stretches over loop 6. This arrangement generates the physical environment required for electrophilic attack of RuBP by CO2. The requirement of Rca arises from the fact that the complex catalytic reaction of Rubisco is error prone, leading to the generation of tight-binding sugar phosphates that inactivate the enzyme. These “misfire” products include xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate (XuBP) and 2,3-pentodiulose-1,5-bisphosphate (PDBP) (Parry et al., 2008Parry M.A.J. Keys A.J. Madgwick P.J. Carmo-Silva A.E. Andralojc P.J. Rubisco regulation: a role for inhibitors.J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, some plants under low light produce the inhibitory 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol-1-phosphate (CA1P) (referred to as “night-time” inhibitor). Binding of RuBP to non-carbamylated Rubisco can also lead to inactive enzyme (Bracher et al., 2017Bracher A. Whitney S.M. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Biogenesis and metabolic maintenance of Rubisco.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2017; 68: 29-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar; Parry et al., 2008Parry M.A.J. Keys A.J. Madgwick P.J.

In all these conditions, the release of the inhibitory sugar is mediated by Rca, which couples ATP hydrolysis to structural remodeling of the Rubisco catalytic site. Rca proteins have evolved independently in photosynthetic organisms and are associated with the red and green lineages of Rubisco (Bhat et al., 2017bBhat J.Y. Thieulin-Pardo G. Hartl F.U.

While divergent in sequence, they all share the canonical AAA+ core consisting of an N-terminal α/β-nucleotide binding subdomain and a C-terminal α-helical subdomain (Figure 1A) and function as six-membered ring complexes. The AAA+ chaperones are typically substrate promiscuous and act by threading flexible terminal sequences or loop segments of their target proteins into the hexamer pore (Olivares et al., 2016Olivares A.O.

A low-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Rca from the proteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Rs) in complex with red-type Rubisco (form 1C) showed that the RsRca hexamer docks onto Rubisco over one catalytic site at a time (Bhat et al., 2017aBhat J.Y.

Moreover, Rca of plants and green algae have a domain N-terminal to the AAA+ core that is required for Rubisco recognition (Figure 1A), and the so-called specificity helix H9 in the α-helical subdomain confers specificity for Rubisco proteins from solanaceous (nightshade) and non-solanaceous species (Li et al., 2005Li C.

Rca-like lacks the flexible N-terminal domain, but its AAA+ core is highly homologous to eukaryotic Rca, with ∼38% sequence identity and ∼70% similarity (Data S1). Consistent with Rca function, the Rca-like protein of Anabaena sp. strain CA was shown to be required for elevated Rubisco activity and growth under high light conditions (Li et al., 1999Li L.A. Zianni M.R. Tabita F.R. Inactivation of the monocistronic rca gene in Anabaena variabilis suggests a physiological ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase-like function in heterocystous cyanobacteria.Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, a recent study could not detect Rca activity for the Rca-like protein from Fremyella diplosiphon (Lechno-Yossef et al., 2020Lechno-Yossef S. Rohnke B.A. Belza A.C.O. Melnicki M.R. Montgomery B.L. Kerfeld C.A. Cyanobacterial carboxysomes contain an unique rubisco-activase-like protein.New Phytol. 2020; 225: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A distinguishing feature of Rca-like is the presence of a Rubisco small subunit-like (SSUL) domain, connected to the C terminus of the AAA+ core via a flexible linker (Figure 1A). The homologous SSUL modules of the scaffolding protein CcmM have been shown to bind to Rubisco, inducing condensate formation for packaging into carboxysomes (Ryan et al., 2019Ryan P. Forrester T.J.B. Wroblewski C. Kenney T.M.G. Kitova E.N. Klassen J.S. Kimber M.S.

Lett. 2017; 364Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Rca-like protein of F. diplosiphon interacts with Rubisco via its SSUL domains, and its deletion resulted in impaired regulation of carboxysome biogenesis (Lechno-Yossef et al., 2020Lechno-Yossef S. Rohnke B.A. Belza A.C.O. Melnicki M.R. Montgomery B.L. Kerfeld C.A. Cyanobacterial carboxysomes contain an unique rubisco-activase-like protein.New Phytol. 2020; 225: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To obtain insight into the basic mechanism of plant Rca, here we analyzed the structure and function of the Rca-like protein of the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (NosRca). We find that NosRca functions as a bona fide Rubisco activase, independent of the SSUL domain (NosRcaΔC). We solved the crystal structure of the NosRcaΔC hexamer and obtained its high-resolution cryo-EM structure in complex with inhibited Rubisco. A key finding is the well-resolved N-terminal amino acid sequence of RbcL inserted into the central pore of the Rca hexamer. Mutational analysis confirmed that plant Rca also engages the N-terminal RbcL sequence of its cognate Rubisco, establishing binding of the N terminus rather than the C terminus as the basic mechanism for activation of form IB Rubisco. We further show that the SSUL domains cooperate with the AAA+ core to ensure that Rca is packaged with Rubisco into carboxysomes. The cyanobacterial Rca thus combines functions in Rubisco remodeling and carboxysome organization. The purified recombinant NosRca protein, with and without nucleotide, behaved as a ∼260 kDa complex by size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS), consistent with a hexamer (Figures S1A and S1B; Table S1). NosRca had a constitutive ATPase activity of ∼6.5 min−1 per protomer (Figure 1B), which is lower than the ATPase rates reported for plant Rca (∼17–45 min−1) (Hazra et al., 2015Hazra S. Henderson J.N. Liles K. Hilton M.T. Wachter R.M. Regulation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) activase: product inhibition, cooperativity, and magnesium activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 24222-24236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We next tested whether NosRca functions as a Rubisco activase, considering that the AAA+ modules of NosRca and the Rca proteins of Nicotiana tabacum (NtRca) and Arabidopsis thaliana (AtRca) share ∼59% sequence identity (Data S2). Because activases are adapted to their cognate Rubisco (Bhat et al., 2017bBhat J.Y. Thieulin-Pardo G. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Rubisco Activases: AAA+ Chaperones Adapted to Enzyme Repair.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4: 20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Mueller-Cajar, 2017Mueller-Cajar O. The diverse AAA+ machines that repair inhibited Rubisco active sites.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4: 31Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we recombinantly expressed and purified the Rubisco from Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (NosRubisco) (Figure S1A) using coexpression of Nostoc chaperonin (NosGroES/EL; see STAR Methods). The purified NosRubisco, activated with CO2 and Mg2+ (ECM), catalyzed the carboxylation of RuBP at a rate of ∼4 molecules of CO2 per active site s−1 (Figures 1C and 1D). However, as shown previously (Li et al., 1999Li L.A. Zianni M.R. Tabita F.R. Inactivation of the monocistronic rca gene in Anabaena variabilis suggests a physiological ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase-like function in heterocystous cyanobacteria.Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), binding of RuBP to the non-activated enzyme did not result in inhibition (Figure S1C), in contrast to plant Rubisco (Parry et al., 2008Parry M.A.J. Keys A.J. Madgwick P.J. Carmo-Silva A.E. Andralojc P.J. Rubisco regulation: a role for inhibitors.J. Exp.

We therefore tested the effect of the misfire sugar phosphate XuBP as a competitive inhibitor (Bracher et al., 2015Bracher A. Sharma A. Starling-Windhof A. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Degradation of potent Rubisco inhibitor by selective sugar phosphatase.Nat. Plants. 2015; 1: 14002Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A ∼60%–80% inhibition of the carboxylation rate was observed at 50 to 150 µM XuBP in the presence of low RuBP (400 µM) (Figure 1C). Note that NosRubisco has a lower affinity for XuBP than plant Rubisco (Bracher et al., 2015Bracher A. Sharma A. Starling-Windhof A. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Degradation of potent Rubisco inhibitor by selective sugar phosphatase.Nat. Plants. 2015; 1: 14002Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar; Pearce, 2006Pearce F.G. Catalytic by-product formation and ligand binding by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylases from different phylogenies.Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Addition of NosRca partially relieved the inhibition in an ATP-dependent manner (Figure 1C), suggesting that NosRca facilitated the release of XuBP from the Rubisco catalytic sites. The effect was only partial because the XuBP remained in the reaction as a competitive inhibitor. However, XuBP is unlikely to be a physiological inhibitor of NosRubisco, consistent with the absence in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 of XuBP phosphatase, which serves to hydrolyze the XuBP upon release (Bracher et al., 2015Bracher A. Sharma A. Starling-Windhof A. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Degradation of potent Rubisco inhibitor by selective sugar phosphatase.Nat. Plants. 2015; 1: 14002Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Complete and highly efficient inhibition of Rubisco was obtained with 2-carboxyarabinitol-1,5-diphosphate (CABP), a mimic of the carboxyketone intermediate of the carboxylation reaction, at a concentration equivalent to Rubisco active sites (0.25 µM) (Figure 1D). Strikingly, NosRca efficiently reactivated the inhibited Rubisco in the presence of ATP (Figures 1D). Thus, NosRca is a bona fide Rubisco activase, although the endogenous inhibitory sugar phosphate(s) of NosRubisco remains to be identified. Deletion of the C-terminal 123 residues (linker and the SSUL domain) in NosRca (NosRcaΔC), resulted in a faster ATPase rate (∼9.5 min−1) and slightly more efficient Rubisco reactivation (Figures 1B and 1D), indicating that the SSUL domain is not required for activase function. The rate of reactivation was dependent on the concentration of NosRca (Figure S1D). Similar ATPase rates were measured in the presence of activated or inhibited Rubisco (Figure 1B), a property similar to plant Rca (Robinson and Portis, 1989Robinson S.P. Portis Jr., A.R. Adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis by purified rubisco activase.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 93-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To allow a structural comparison of NosRca with plant Rca, we solved the crystal structure of NosRcaΔC (residues 2–291) at ∼2.7 Å by Gd-multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (Gd-MAD) (Figure S1A; Table S2). The resolution of the isomorphic native structure was 2.45 Å (Table S2). The asymmetric unit contained two subunits of NosRcaΔC, with chain A (residues 2–275) having no nucleotide bound and chain B (residues 2–278) having ADP bound (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A).

https://openalex.org/W3091027175,"In the past few decades, there has been a rapid growth in the concentration of nitrogenous compounds such as nitrate-nitrogen and ammonia-nitrogen in rivers, primarily due to increasing agricultural and industrial activities. These nitrogenous compounds are mainly responsible for eutrophication when present in river water, and for 'blue baby syndrome' when present in drinking water. High concentrations of these compounds in rivers may eventually lead to the closure of treatment plants. This study presents a training and a selection approach to develop an optimum artificial neural network model for predicting monthly average nitrate-N and monthly average ammonia-N. Several studies have predicted these compounds, but most of the proposed procedures do not involve testing various model architectures in order to achieve the optimum predicting model. Additionally, none of the models have been trained for hydrological conditions such as the case of Malaysia. This study presents models trained on the hydrological data from 1981 to 2017 for the Langat River in Selangor, Malaysia. The model architectures used for training are General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Multilayer Neural Network and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). These models were trained for various combinations of internal parameters, input variables and model architectures. Post-training, the optimum performing model was selected based on the regression and error values and plot of predicted versus observed values. Optimum models provide promising results with a minimum overall regression value of 0.92."
https://openalex.org/W3088567775,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a widespread inflammatory bowel disease that causes long-lasting inflammation and ulcers in the colon and rectum. In the inflamed tissue of patients with UC, the tight junctions are disrupted and large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced, resulting in immune dysregulation. The expression of Nur77 is significantly reduced in the colon of inflammatory bowel disease, while Nur77 deficiency increases the susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis. Here, we report that Gly-Pro-Ala (GPA) peptide isolated from fish skin gelatin hydrolysate can significantly alleviate intestinal inflammation and damage caused by DSS-induced mice colitis. Besides maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier, GPA alleviates intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress by inhibiting NF-κB activation. Interestingly, GPA binds to the ligand-binding domain of Nur77 and stimulates its autotranscriptional activity to enhance its expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, GPA activates the promoter of IκBα to increase its expression, resulting in the abolishment of the NF-κB pathway. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of GPA on colitis are abolished in Nur77-/- mice. Our results suggest that as a Nur77 modulator, GPA may be applied to the prevention of intestinal inflammation."

In this paper, China's coastal urban agglomeration is taken as the research area, aiming at the serious air pollution problem of coastal urban agglomeration, geographic information system (ArcGIS10.2) spatial analysis and the spatial Dubin model were applied to National Aeronautics and Space Administration atmospheric remote sensing image inversion fine particulate matter (PM2.5) data from 2010-2016 to reveal the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics and Influence mechanism of PM2.5 in China's coastal urban agglomerations, with a view to providing a reference value for coordinating air pollution in the coastal cities of the world. From 2010-2016, the PM2.5 concentration in China's coastal urban agglomerations decreased as a whole, and large spatial differences in PM2.5 concentration were observed in China's coastal urban agglomerations; the core high-pollution areas were the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Shandong Peninsula, and Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations. Large spatial differences in PM2.5 concentration were also observed within individual urban agglomerations, with higher PM2.5 concentrations found in the northern parts of the urban agglomerations. Significant spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity were observed among PM2.5-polluted cities in China's coastal urban agglomerations. The northern coastal urban agglomerations formed a relatively stable and continuous high-pollution zone. The spatial Dubin model was used to analyze the driving factors of PM2.5 pollution in coastal urban agglomerations. Together, meteorological, socioeconomic, pollution source, and ecological factors affected the spatial characteristics of PM2.5 pollution during the study period, and the overall effect was a mixed effect with significant spatial variation. Among them, meteorological factors were the greatest driver of PM2.5 pollution. In the short term, the rapid increase in population density, industrial emissions, industrial energy consumption, and total traffic emissions were the important driving factors of PM2.5 pollution in the coastal urban agglomerations of China."
https://openalex.org/W3091089154,"The genetic risk for prostate cancer has been governed by a few rare variants with high penetrance and over 150 commonly occurring variants with lower impact on risk; however, most of these variants have been identified in studies containing exclusively European individuals. People of non-European ancestries make up less than 15% of prostate cancer GWAS subjects. Across the globe, incidence of prostate cancer varies with population due to environmental and genetic factors. The discrepancy between disease incidence and representation in genetics highlights the need for more studies of the genetic risk for prostate cancer across diverse populations. To better understand the genetic risk for prostate cancer across diverse populations, we performed PrediXcan and GWAS in a case-control study of 4,769 self-identified African American (2,463 cases and 2,306 controls), 2,199 Japanese American (1,106 cases and 1,093 controls), and 2,147 Latin American (1,081 cases and 1,066 controls) individuals from the Multiethnic Genome-wide Scan of Prostate Cancer. We used prediction models from 46 tissues in GTEx version 8 and five models from monocyte transcriptomes in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Across the three populations, we predicted 19 gene-tissue pairs, including five unique genes, to be significantly (lfsr < 0.05) associated with prostate cancer. One of these genes, NKX3-1, replicated in a larger European study. At the SNP level, 110 SNPs met genome-wide significance in the African American study while 123 SNPs met significance in the Japanese American study. Fine mapping revealed three significant independent loci in the African American study and two significant independent loci in the Japanese American study. These identified loci confirm findings from previous GWAS of prostate cancer in diverse populations while PrediXcan-identified genes suggest potential new directions for prostate cancer research in populations across the globe."

We aimed to clarify the roles of PGF2α in the regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation. At 24 hours after LPS administration, neutrophil infiltration in peritoneal cavity, the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and tissue damages in lung, liver, and kidney were all increased. Inhibition of FP receptors significantly decreased LPS-induced neutrophil infiltration and lowered the mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. At 6 hour after LPS administration, the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 in peritoneal lavage fluid was higher than that in naive mice. Inhibition of FP receptors in these mice increased IL-10 level further. Stimulation of isolated peritoneal neutrophils by LPS increased the gene expression of IL-10, which was further increased by AL8810 treatment. Administration of an anti-IL-10 antibody antagonized the AL8810-decreased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and tissue damages. These results indicate that inhibition of FP receptors by AL8810 attenuated LPS-induced systemic inflammation in mice via enhanced IL-10 production."
https://openalex.org/W3088101403,"Preeclampsia, a major human pregnancy-specific disorder, leads to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Here we reported that 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2), an enzyme that degrades active glucocorticoids, is one of the key factors that contributes to preeclampsia development. In the pregnant rat model, we firstly confirmed that administration of 11β-HSD2 inhibitor carbenoxolone (CBX) subcutaneously or by placenta-targeted delivery system could lead to a decrease in placental 11β-HSD2 expression and activity and an increase in corticosterone level in placenta and maternal circulation. Then, we showed that subcutaneous administration and placenta-targeted delivery of CBX resulted in the hallmark of preeclampsia-like features including hypertension, proteinuria, renal damages as well as elevated circulatory soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) and increased sFlt1/placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio in pregnant rats. These animals displayed decreased trophoblast invasion in uterus, impaired spiral artery remodeling, and reduced placental blood flow. Preeclampsia-like features could also be induced by administration of dexamethasone in pregnant rats. In the cultured human trophoblast models, we found that cortisol only inhibited migration and invasion of the extravillous trophoblasts with 11β-HSD2 knockdown, and promoted sFlt1 release in the cultured syncytiotrophoblasts with 11β-HSD2 knockdown. Furthermore, we elucidated that cortisol stimulated a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)17 expression in placentas, thereby promoting sFlt1 release in placenta. Collectively, our study provided the evidence that placental 11β-HSD2 dysfunction plays a key role in the development of preeclampsia and immediately identified innovative target to counteract preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W3088270791,"RNA polymerase II is one of the most vital macromolecular complexes in eukaryotes and the assembly of such complete enzyme requires many factors. Three members of GPN-loop GTPase family Npa3/Gpn1, Gpn2, and Gpn3 participate in the biogenesis of RNA polymerase II with nonredundant roles. We show here that rapid degradation of each GPN protein in yeast leads to cytoplasmic accumulation of Rpb1 and defects in the assembly of RNA polymerase II, suggesting conserved functions of GPN paralogs for RNA polymerase II biogenesis as in humans. Taking advantage of a multicopy genetic screening, we identified GPN3 and assembly factor RBA50 among others as strong suppressors of npa3ts mutants. We further demonstrated that Npa3 interacts with Gpn3 and Rba50, similarly human Gpn1 physically interacts with Gpn3 and RPAP1 (human analog of Rba50). Moreover, a mutual dependency of protein levels of Npa3 and Gpn3 was also clearly presented in yeast using an auxin-inducible degron (AID) system. Interestingly, Rpb2, the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II was determined to be the subunit that interacts with both Gpn1 and Rba50, indicating a close association of Npa3 and Rba50 in Rpb2 subcomplex assembly. Based on these results, we conclude that Npa3 interacts with Gpn3 and Rba50, for RNA polymerase II biogenesis. We therefore propose that multiple factors may coordinate through conserved regulatory mechanisms in the assembly of RNA polymerase complex."
https://openalex.org/W3087809066,"Abstract Progression through mitosis is balanced by the timely regulation of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events ensuring the correct segregation of chromosomes before cytokinesis. This balance is regulated by the opposing actions of CDK1 and PP2A, as well as the Greatwall kinase/MASTL. MASTL is commonly overexpressed in cancer, which makes it a potential therapeutic anticancer target. Loss of Mastl induces multiple chromosomal errors that lead to the accumulation of micronuclei and multilobulated cells in mitosis. Our analyses revealed that loss of Mastl leads to chromosome breaks and abnormalities impairing correct segregation. Phospho-proteomic data for Mastl knockout cells revealed alterations in proteins implicated in multiple processes during mitosis including double-strand DNA damage repair. In silico prediction of the kinases with affected activity unveiled NEK2 to be regulated in the absence of Mastl . We uncovered that, RAD51AP1, involved in regulation of homologous recombination, is phosphorylated by NEK2 and CDK1 but also efficiently dephosphorylated by PP2A/B55. Our results suggest that MastlKO disturbs the equilibrium of the mitotic phosphoproteome that leads to the disruption of DNA damage repair and triggers an accumulation of chromosome breaks even in noncancerous cells."

Methods This retrospective, longitudinal cohort study included consecutive patients with primary SS evaluated at a tertiary referral center. An electronic chart review was performed and all available data were extracted from clinic visits between October 1999 and March 2019. The primary outcome measures included occurrence of extraglandular ocular manifestations of SS, serological markers, prevalence of malignancy, and incidence of death. Results One hundred and twenty-six SS patients with minimum 3 years of follow-up (median 9.6, range 3.0–15.9 years, total of 1,235 patient-years) were included. Of those, 10 patients with inflammatory keratolysis or scleritis had 2.3 times greater likelihood of death compared to the rest of the cohort (OR = 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5 to 4.0, p = 0.01) due to SS related complications. The lifetime prevalence of any malignancy in the entire cohort was 15.5%. The most common hematologic malignancy was non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (4.8%) and the most common solid malignancy was breast cancer (6.0%). Men SS patients were more likely to have a history of or concurrent malignancy compared to women (30.0% versus 13.7%, p = 0.16) and double the mortality (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.4, p = 0.04), independent of malignancy. Conclusions SS patients with serious ocular manifestations, particularly men, may be at greater risk for mortality due to SS complications. The eye seems to be the barometer of systemic disease activity."

We investigated the clinical characteristics and prognosis of MCL with GI tract involvement. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 64 patients diagnosed with MCL from January 2009 to April 2017. At the time of MCL diagnosis, patients who were identified to have GI involvement by endoscopic or radiologic examination were assigned to the GI-MCL group. The other patients were assigned to the non GI-MCL group. Results The GI-MCL group included 28 patients (43.8%). The most common endoscopic finding of MCL was lymphomatous polyposis (20/28, 71.4%). The GI-MCL group had higher stage and International Prognostic Index status (P = 0.012 and P = 0.003, respectively). Among the total 51 GI lesions in the GI-MCL group, 31.4% (16/51) were detected only by endoscopic examinations and were not detected on CT or PET-CT. The cumulative incidence of recurrence was higher in the GI-MCL group compared with the non GI-MCL group but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.082). Stage (HR 1.994, 95% CI 1.007–3.948) and auto PBSCT (HR 0.133, 95% CI 0.041–0.437) were identified as independent predictive factors for recurrence.

Among 15 GI tract recurrences, five recurrences were detected only with endoscopic examinations. Conclusions Endoscopy can reveal the GI involvement of MCL that is not visualized by radiological imaging. Endoscopic examinations are recommended during staging workup and the follow-up period of MCL patients."
https://openalex.org/W3090104784,"Emergence of HIV drug resistance poses a serious risk of inactivity to all currently approved antiretroviral drugs. Profiles of HIV drug resistance mutations (HIVDRM) and virological failure (VF) are not extensively studied in Tanzania. This study aimed to determine HIVDRM and predictors of VF in HIV-infected individuals failing first-line HIV drugs in Moshi, Northern Tanzania. A case-control study was conducted at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Mawenzi, Pasua and Majengo health facilities with HIV-care and treatment clinics from October, 2017 to August, 2018. Cases and controls were HIV-infected individuals with VF and viral suppression (VS) respectively. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease genes were amplified and sequenced. Stanford University’s HIV drug resistance database and REGA subtyping tool 3.0 determined HIVDRM and HIV-1 subtypes respectively. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) investigated predictors of VF. P-value < 5% was considered statistically significant. A total of 124 participants were recruited, of whom 63 (50.8%) had VF, 61 (49.2%) had VS and 82 (66.1%) were females. Median [IQR] age and duration on ART were 45 [35–52] years and 72 [48–104] months respectively. Twenty-five out of 26 selected samples from cases were successfully sequenced. Twenty-four samples (96%) had at least one major mutation conferring resistance to HIV drugs, with non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-resistance associated mutations as the majority (92%). Frequent NNRTI-resistance associated mutations were K103N (n = 11), V106M (n = 5) and G190A (n = 5). Prevalent nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors-resistance associated mutations were M184V (n = 17), K70R (n = 7) and D67N (n = 6). Dual-class resistance was observed in 16 (64%) samples. Thirteen samples (52%) had at least one thymidine analogue-resistance associated mutation (TAM). Three samples (12%) had T69D mutation with at least 1 TAM. Two samples (8%) had at least one mutation associated with protease inhibitor resistance. Age [aOR = 0.94, 95% CI (0.90–0.97), p < 0.001] and occupation [aOR = 0.35, 95% CI (0.12–1.04), p = 0.059] associated with VF. In conclusion, HIV drug resistance is common among people failing antiretroviral therapy. Resistance testing will help to guide switching of HIV drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3088528825,"The LPBN (lateral parabrachial nucleus) plays an important role in feeding control. CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) LPBN neurons activation mediates the anorectic effects of different gut-derived peptides, including amylin. Amylin and its long acting analog sCT (salmon calcitonin) exert their anorectic actions primarily by directly activating neurons located in the area postrema (AP). A large proportion of projections from the AP and the adjacent nucleus of the solitary tractNTS to the LPBN, are noradrenergic (NA), and amylin-activated NAAP neurons are critical in mediating amylin's hypophagic effects. Here, we determine the functional role of NAAP amylin activated neurons to activate CGRP and non-CGRP LPBN neurons. To this end, NA was specifically depleted in the rat LPBN through a stereotaxic microinfusion of 6-OHDA, a neurotoxic agent that destroys NA terminals. While amylin (50 μg/kg) and sCT (5 μg/kg) reduced eating in sham-lesioned rats, no reduction in feeding occurred in NA-depleted animals. Further, the amylin-induced c-Fos response in the LPBN and c-Fos/CGRP colocalization were reduced in NA-depleted animals compared to controls. We conclude that AP → LPBN NA signaling, through the activation of LPBN CGRP neurons, mediates part of amylin's hypophagic effect."
https://openalex.org/W3088961390,"Background Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal bands (OCB) occur in chronic or post-acute phase of inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system. Objective To determine whether CSF OCB in patients with neuroborreliosis (NB) are specific for borrelia burgdorferi senso lato. Methods We performed isoelectric focusing followed by immunoblotting in CSF of 10 NB patients and 11 controls (7 patients with multiple sclerosis, 2 patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease, 1 patient with dementia and 1 patient with monoclonal gammopathy). Immunoblotting was performed using an uncoated as well as a borrelia antigen pre-coated nitrocellulose membrane (NCM). OCB were counted by visual inspection and photometric analysis. OCB were compared between uncoated und pre-coated NCM both in the NB and control group. For validation purposes inter-assay precision was determined by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) Results Borrelia-specific OCB were found in the CSF of 9 NB patients and in none of the control subjects resulting in a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 100%. Number of NB specific OCB were 11±7 bands by photometric analyses compared to 9±5 bands by visual inspection. Validation experiments revealed an inconsistent inter-assay precision between visual and photometric analyses (NB uncoated: visual 28% versus photometric 14%, control subject uncoated: visual 16% versus photometric 24%). Conclusions In CSF samples with positive OCB, Borrelia-specific bands were detected in almost all NB patients and in none of the control subjects. Inconsistent inter-assay precision may be explained by a poor comparability of visual and photometric approach."
https://openalex.org/W3089923043,"The popularity of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has made people's driving environment more comfortable and convenient. However, with the integration of external networks and the vehicle networks, the vulnerabilities of the Controller Area Network (CAN) are exposed, allowing attackers to remotely invade vehicle networks through external devices. Based on the remote attack model for vulnerabilities of the in-vehicle CAN, we designed an efficient and safe identity authentication scheme based on Feige-Fiat-Shamir (FFS) zero-knowledge identification scheme with extremely high soundness. We used the method of zero-one reversal and two-to-one verification to solve the problem that FFS cannot effectively resist guessing attacks. Then, we carried out a theoretical analysis of the scheme’s security and evaluated it on the software and hardware platform. Finally, regarding time overhead, under the same parameters, compared with the existing scheme, the scheme can complete the authentication within 6.1ms without having to go through multiple rounds of interaction, which reduces the additional authentication delay and enables all private keys to participate in one round of authentication, thereby eliminating the possibility that a private key may not be involved in the original protocol. Regarding security and soundness, as long as private keys are not cracked, the scheme can resist guessing attacks, which is more secure than the existing scheme."
https://openalex.org/W3090711169,"Objective The objective of this study was to develop a measurement tool to capture local public health department (LHD) organizational characteristics that align with implementation of equity-oriented practice, which may be used to gauge progress in building public health structures and functions that address the needs of vulnerable populations and reduce health inequities. Methods We developed and tested a measurement tool, with practitioner input, based on an implementation science framework and informed by previous work defining public health essential services and practice recommendations for health equity. Measures assessed types of vulnerable populations served by the LHD, organizational climate, and four equity-oriented practice areas, including: assessment and planning, monitoring and analysis, leadership support, and obesity prevention. We also assessed opportunities for capacity building by identifying training needs of practitioners. Primary data were collected from Missouri local health department practitioners (n = 92, 80% response rate) via an online questionnaire, with a subset of the sample providing data for test-retest reliability. Results Measures of equity-oriented implementation climate indicated areas of variability with respect to strengths and gaps across LHDs. While implementation climate was strong with respect to perceived importance (86%), a substantial proportion of LHDs cited concern over other priorities conflicting with equity-oriented implementation (32%). Likewise, a strong internal push (67%) was often accompanied by limited external political (25%) and community support (40%). Implementation climate measures generally had good to excellent reliability and were significantly associated with areas of equity-oriented practice. Frequently identified (>70%) training needs included improving skills in applying frameworks, assessment methods, and evaluating collaborations around equity. Conclusion We developed a theory-based, practitioner-informed questionnaire to assess capacity for equity-oriented practice and identify opportunities for capacity building in local public health departments to engage in effective change toward health equity."
https://openalex.org/W3088375862,"Previously, we demonstrated the in vitro anti-tumor effects of desethylamiodarone (DEA) in bladder and cervix cancer cell lines. In the present study, we intended to establish its potentiality in B16-F10 metastatic melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. We assessed cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle by using sulforhodamine B assay, Muse™ Annexin V & Dead Cell and Muse® Cell Cycle assays, respectively. We determined colony formation after crystal violet staining. For studying mechanistic aspects, immunoblotting analysis was performed. We used a C57BL/6 experimental lung metastasis model for demonstrating in vivo anti-metastatic potential of DEA. DEA inhibited in vitro proliferation and colony formation, and in vivo lung metastasizing properties of B16-F10 cells. It arrested the cells in G0/G1 phase of their cycle likely via p21 in a p53-dependent fashion, and induced caspase mediated apoptosis likely via inversely regulating Bcl-2 and Bax levels, and reducing Akt and ERK1/2 activation. In this study, we provided in vitro and in vivo experimental evidences for DEA's potentiality in the therapy of metastatic melanomas. Since DEA is the major metabolite of amiodarone, a worldwide used antiarrhythmic drug, safety concerns could be resolved more easily for it than for a novel pharmacological agent."
https://openalex.org/W3088737173,"Kv1.3 potassium channel is considered as a target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), since Kv1.3 blockade suppresses memory T cell activation including cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. However, the underlying signaling pathway related to autoimmune CD8+ T cell inhibition by Kv1.3 channel in neuroinflammatory diseases remains unclear. We found that ImK, a selective Kv1.3 blocker, reduced auto-reactive CD8+ T cell infiltration in the spinal cords of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rats, an animal model of MS. ImK suppressed transcriptional factor Blimp-1 expression and reduced the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells on neuronal cells. Furthermore, ImK upregulated co-inhibitory molecule PD-1 to inhibit B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein (Blimp-1) in an IL-2 independent way. In addition, PD-1 inhibitor impaired the suppression of ImK on CD8+ T cells and accelerated EAE progression. Our study demonstrated a novel regulatory mechanism of Kv1.3 blockade on modulating CD8+ T cell differentiation through PD-1/Blimp-1 signaling. This work expands the understanding of Kv1.3 channel for modulating neuroinflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3088952771,"All neurodegenerative diseases involve a relatively long period of timeframe from the onset of the disease to complete loss of functions. Extending this timeframe, even at a reduced level of function, would improve the quality of life of patients with these devastating diseases. The retina, as the part of the central nervous system and a frequent site of many distressing neurodegenerative disease, provides an ideal model to investigate the feasibility of extending the functional timeframe through pharmacologic intervention. Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a group of blinding diseases. Although the rate of progression and degree of visual loss varies, there is usually a prolonged time before patients totally lose their photoreceptors and vision. It is believed that inhibitory mechanisms are still intact and may become relatively strong after the gradual loss of photoreceptors in RP patients. Therefore, it is possible that light-evoked responses of retinal ganglion cells and visual information processes in retinal circuits could be by blocking these inhibitory mechanisms restoring some level of visual function. Our results indicate that if the inhibition in the inner retina was unmasked in the retina of the rd10 mouse (the well-characterized RP mimicking, clinically relevant mouse model), the light-evoked responses of many retinal ganglion cells can be induced and restore their normal light sensitivity. GABA A receptor plays a major role in this masking inhibition. ERG b-wave and behavioral tests of spatial vision partly recovered after the application of PTX. Hence, removing retinal inhibition unmasks signalling mediated by surviving cones, thereby restoring some degree of visual function. These results may offer a novel strategy to restore the visual function with the surviving cones in RP patients and other gradual and progressive neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3091530595,"Here we have improved an existing mouse model of prostate cancer based on prostate-specific deletion of Pten and Trp53 by incorporating a Cre-activatable luciferase reporter. By coupling the deletion of those genes to the activation of a luciferase reporter, we were able to monitor tumor burden non-invasively over time. We show that, consistent with previous reports, deletion of both Pten and Trp53 on a C57BL/6 background accelerates tumor growth and results in both the loss of androgen receptor expression and castrate resistant tumors as compared with loss of Pten alone. Loss of Trp53 results in the development of sarcomatoid histology and the expression of markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition Zeb1 and vimentin, with kinetics and penetrance dependent on whether one or both alleles of Trp53 were deleted. Homozygous deletion of Trp53 and Pten resulted in uniformly lethal disease by 25 weeks. While we were able to detect locally invasive disease in the peritoneal cavity in aggressive tumors from the double knockout mice, we were unable to detect lymphatic or hematogenous metastatic disease in lymph nodes or at distant sites."
https://openalex.org/W3091636661,"Tsetse eradication continues to be a top priority for African governments including that of Senegal, which embarked on a project to eliminate Glossina palpalis gambiensis from the Niayes area, following an area-wide integrated pest management approach with an SIT component. A successful SIT programme requires competitive sterile males of high biological quality. This may be hampered by handling processes including irradiation and the release mechanisms, necessitating continued improvement of these processes, to maintain the quality of flies. A new prototype of an automated chilled adult release system (Bruno Spreader Innovation, (BSI™)) for tsetse flies was tested for its accuracy (in counting) and release rate consistency. Also, its impact on the quality of the released sterile males was evaluated on performance indicators, including flight propensity, mating competitiveness, premating and mating duration, insemination rate of mated females and survival of male flies. The BSITM release system accurately counted and homogenously released flies at the lowest motor speed set (0.6 rpm), at a consistent rate of 60±9.58 males/min. Also, the release process, chilling (6 ± 1°C) and passing of flies through the machine) had no significant negative impact on the male flight propensity, mating competitiveness, premating and mating durations and the insemination rates. Only the survival of flies was negatively affected whether under feeding or starvation. The positive results of this study show that the BSI™ release system is promising for use in future tsetse SIT programmes. However, the negative impact of the release process on survival of flies needs to be addressed in future studies and results of this study confirmed under operational field conditions in West Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3089502862,"Subsurface microbial communities mediate the transformation and fate of redox sensitive materials including organic matter, metals and radionuclides. Few studies have explored how changing geochemical conditions influence the composition of groundwater microbial communities over time. We temporally monitored alterations in abiotic forces on microbial community structure using 1L in-field bioreactors receiving background and contaminated groundwater at the Oak Ridge Reservation, TN. Planktonic and biofilm microbial communities were initialized with background water for 4 days to establish communities in triplicate control reactors and triplicate test reactors and then fed filtered water for 14 days. On day 18, three reactors were switched to receive filtered groundwater from a contaminated well, enriched in total dissolved solids relative to the background site, particularly chloride, nitrate, uranium, and sulfate. Biological and geochemical data were collected throughout the experiment, including planktonic and biofilm DNA for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, cell counts, total protein, anions, cations, trace metals, organic acids, bicarbonate, pH, Eh, DO, and conductivity. We observed significant shifts in both planktonic and biofilm microbial communities receiving contaminated water. This included a loss of rare taxa, especially amongst members of the Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Betaproteobacteria, but enrichment in the Fe- and nitrate- reducing Ferribacterium and parasitic Bdellovibrio. These shifted communities were more similar to the contaminated well community, suggesting that geochemical forces substantially influence microbial community diversity and structure. These influences can only be captured through such comprehensive temporal studies, which also enable more robust and accurate predictive models to be developed."
https://openalex.org/W3088998699,"Objectives We examined how caregivers who had cared for a relative at end of life (EoL) wished to be cared for in the event that they experienced advanced dementia or physical disability in the future, and what factors influenced their preferences for EoL care. Methods In this mixed-methods study, 83 participants, recruited from multiple sources in Israel, were interviewed concerning socio-demographic factors, health status, past experience with EoL, preference for extension of life vs. quality of life (QoL), willingness to be dependent on others, and preferences for EoL care. Results In case of advanced dementia, 58% preferred euthanasia or suicide; around a third chose those for physical disability. Care by family members was the least desired form of care in the advanced dementia scenario, although more desirable than institutional care in the physical disability scenario. QoL was rated as the highest factor impacting preferences for EoL care. Men demonstrated a higher preference than women for extension of life over QoL. Conclusion Our study points to the need for society to consider solutions to the request of participants to reject the type of EoL experienced by their relatives. Those solutions include investing in improving the quality of life at the end of life, and offering alternatives such as euthanasia, which a large proportion of our participants found ethically and medically appropriate within the current system of care in the event of severe physical disability, and more so in the event of advanced dementia."
https://openalex.org/W3090652673,"Reliably predicting sustainable exploitation levels for many tropical species subject to hunting remains a difficult task, largely because of the inherent uncertainty associated with estimating parameters related to both population dynamics and hunting pressure. Here, we investigate a modelling approach to support decisions in bushmeat management which explicitly considers parameter uncertainty. We apply the approach to duiker Cephalophus spp., assuming either a constant quota-based, or a constant proportional harvesting, strategy. Within each strategy, we evaluate different hunting levels in terms of both average yield and survival probability, over different time horizons. Under quota-based harvesting, considering uncertainty revealed a trade-off between yield and extinction probability that was not evident when ignoring uncertainty. The highest yield was returned by a quota that implied a 40% extinction risk, whereas limiting extinction risk to 10% reduced yield by 50%-70%. By contrast, under proportional harvesting, there was no trade-off between yield and extinction probability. The maximum proportion returned a yield comparable with the maximum possible under quota-based harvesting, but with extinction risk below 10%. However, proportional harvesting can be harder to implement in practice because it depends on an estimate of population size. In both harvesting approaches, predicted yields were highly right-skewed with median yields differing from mean yields, implying that decision outcomes depend on attitude to risk. The analysis shows how an explicit consideration of all available information, including uncertainty, can, as part of a wider process involving multiple stakeholders, help inform harvesting policies."

Fifteen rats were constructed into chronic kidney disease models (the model group). The remaining seven rats only received renal capsule stripping instead of nephrectomy (the sham-operated group). Ten weeks after model construction, the bodyweight, blood biochemical indicators, and metabolic parameters of rats in groups were measured. Meanwhile, the expression of the M1 phenotype marker protein in peritoneal macrophages was determined.Ten weeks after model construction, the bodyweight of rats in the model group was significantly lower than that in the sham-operated group. The values of urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were significantly higher than those in the sham-operated group (P<0.01). The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) of rats in the model group were significantly higher than those in the sham-operated group (P <0.01). After the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, the expressions of M1 phenotype marker mRNA in the model group was significantly increased. The expression of mitochondrial structural protein mRNA in the peritoneal macrophages of rats in the model group was significantly lower than that in the sham-operated group. The expression of M1 phenotype marker mRNA was significantly decreased in the uremic serum group after AMPK agonist (P<0.01).In rats with chronic renal insufficiency, mitochondrial regeneration was dysfunctional in macrophages. By activating AMPK, the inhibitory effect of uremia serum on mitochondrial regeneration of macrophages was improved. Therefore, AMPK was a critical factor that could regulate mitochondrial regeneration of macrophages."
