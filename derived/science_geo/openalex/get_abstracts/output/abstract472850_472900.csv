https://openalex.org/W2073726416,"Organic-inorganic perovskites have shown promise as high-performance absorbers in solar cells, first as a coating on a mesoporous metal oxide scaffold and more recently as a solid layer in planar heterojunction architectures. Here, we report transient absorption and photoluminescence-quenching measurements to determine the electron-hole diffusion lengths, diffusion constants, and lifetimes in mixed halide (CH3NH3PbI(3-x)Cl(x)) and triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite absorbers. We found that the diffusion lengths are greater than 1 micrometer in the mixed halide perovskite, which is an order of magnitude greater than the absorption depth. In contrast, the triiodide absorber has electron-hole diffusion lengths of ~100 nanometers. These results justify the high efficiency of planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells and identify a critical parameter to optimize for future perovskite absorber development."
https://openalex.org/W2129970907,"Low-temperature solution-processed photovoltaics suffer from low efficiencies because of poor exciton or electron-hole diffusion lengths (typically about 10 nanometers). Recent reports of highly efficient CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells in a broad range of configurations raise a compelling case for understanding the fundamental photophysical mechanisms in these materials. By applying femtosecond transient optical spectroscopy to bilayers that interface this perovskite with either selective-electron or selective-hole extraction materials, we have uncovered concrete evidence of balanced long-range electron-hole diffusion lengths of at least 100 nanometers in solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3. The high photoconversion efficiencies of these systems stem from the comparable optical absorption length and charge-carrier diffusion lengths, transcending the traditional constraints of solution-processed semiconductors."

Using state-of-the-art in vivo two-photon imaging to directly compare two arousal states in the same mouse, Xie et al. (p. 373 ; see the Perspective by Herculano-Houzel ) found that metabolic waste products of neural activity were cleared out of the sleeping brain at a faster rate than during the awake state. This finding suggests a mechanistic explanation for how sleep serves a restorative function, in addition to its well-described effects on memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2134105845,"Introduction Recent decades have seen a major international effort to inventory tree communities in the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield (Amazonia), but the vast extent and record diversity of these forests have hampered an understanding of basinwide patterns. To overcome this obstacle, we compiled and standardized species-level data on more than half a million trees in 1170 plots sampling all major lowland forest types to explore patterns of commonness, rarity, and richness. Methods The ~6-million-km 2 Amazonian lowlands were divided into 1° cells, and mean tree density was estimated for each cell by using a loess regression model that included no environmental data but had its basis exclusively in the geographic location of tree plots. A similar model, allied with a bootstrapping exercise to quantify sampling error, was used to generate estimated Amazon-wide abundances of the 4962 valid species in the data set. We estimated the total number of tree species in the Amazon by fitting the mean rank-abundance data to Fisher’s log-series distribution. Results Our analyses suggest that lowland Amazonia harbors 3.9 × 10 11 trees and ~16,000 tree species. We found 227 “hyperdominant” species (1.4% of the total) to be so common that together they account for half of all trees in Amazonia, whereas the rarest 11,000 species account for just 0.12% of trees. Most hyperdominants are habitat specialists that have large geographic ranges but are only dominant in one or two regions of the basin, and a median of 41% of trees in individual plots belong to hyperdominants. A disproportionate number of hyperdominants are palms, Myristicaceae, and Lecythidaceae. Discussion The finding that Amazonia is dominated by just 227 tree species implies that most biogeochemical cycling in the world’s largest tropical forest is performed by a tiny sliver of its diversity. The causes underlying hyperdominance in these species remain unknown. Both competitive superiority and widespread pre-1492 cultivation by humans are compelling hypotheses that deserve testing. Although the data suggest that spatial models can effectively forecast tree community composition and structure of unstudied sites in Amazonia, incorporating environmental data may yield substantial improvements. An appreciation of how thoroughly common species dominate the basin has the potential to simplify research in Amazonian biogeochemistry, ecology, and vegetation mapping. Such advances are urgently needed in light of the &gt;10,000 rare, poorly known, and potentially threatened tree species in the Amazon."

The function of the C9ORF72 protein is unknown, as is the mechanism by which the repeat expansion could cause disease. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-differentiated neurons from C9ORF72 ALS patients revealed disease-specific (1) intranuclear GGGGCCexp RNA foci, (2) dysregulated gene expression, (3) sequestration of GGGGCCexp RNA binding protein ADARB2, and (4) susceptibility to excitotoxicity. These pathological and pathogenic characteristics were confirmed in ALS brain and were mitigated with antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics to the C9ORF72 transcript or repeat expansion despite the presence of repeat-associated non-ATG translation (RAN) products. These data indicate a toxic RNA gain-of-function mechanism as a cause of C9ORF72 ALS and provide candidate antisense therapeutics and candidate human pharmacodynamic markers for therapy."

However, these materials experience substantial volume change during electrochemical operation, which causes mechanical fracture of the material and structural disintegration of the electrode, leading to capacity loss. In this work, we use x-ray tomography during battery operation to visualize and quantify the origins and evolution of electrochemical and mechanical degradation. Tomography provides the time-resolved, three-dimensional chemical composition and morphology within individual particles and throughout the electrode.

Here, we describe activated PI3K-δ syndrome (APDS), a PID associated with a dominant gain-of-function mutation in which lysine replaced glutamic acid at residue 1021 (E1021K) in the p110δ protein, the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ), encoded by the PIK3CD gene. We found E1021K in 17 patients from seven unrelated families, but not among 3346 healthy subjects. APDS was characterized by recurrent respiratory infections, progressive airway damage, lymphopenia, increased circulating transitional B cells, increased immunoglobulin M, and reduced immunoglobulin G2 levels in serum and impaired vaccine responses. The E1021K mutation enhanced membrane association and kinase activity of p110δ. Patient-derived lymphocytes had increased levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphorylated AKT protein and were prone to activation-induced cell death. Selective p110δ inhibitors IC87114 and GS-1101 reduced the activity of the mutant enzyme in vitro, which suggested a therapeutic approach for patients with APDS."

However, at some stage, the fine-grained structure that forms saturates. Liu et al. (p. 337 ; see the Perspective by Ramtani ), show that combining the application of a very-high-rate shear deformation with high strain gradients to the surface layer of a pure sample of nickel can overcome this saturation. Instead of a three-dimensional fine-grained structure, a top layer with a two-dimensional layered structure occupied the first 80 micrometers.

In many cases, the same variant is associated with quantitative changes in multiple histone marks and Pol II, as well as in deoxyribonuclease I sensitivity and nucleosome positioning. Transcription factor binding site polymorphisms are correlated overall with differences in local histone modification, and we identify specific transcription factors whose binding leads to histone modification in LCLs.

To understand the interplay between chromatin and genetic control of gene regulation, we quantified allelic variability in transcription factor binding, histone modifications, and gene expression within humans. We found abundant allelic specificity in chromatin and extensive local, short-range, and long-range allelic coordination among the studied molecular phenotypes. We observed genetic influence on most of these phenotypes, with histone modifications exhibiting strong context-dependent behavior.

https://openalex.org/W2091116794,"Homeostatic plasticity is important to maintain a set level of activity in neuronal circuits and has been most extensively studied in cell cultures following activity blockade. It is still unclear, however, whether activity changes associated with mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity occur in vivo, for example after changes in sensory input. Here, we show that activity levels in the visual cortex are significantly decreased after sensory deprivation by retinal lesions, followed by a gradual increase in activity levels in the 48 hr after deprivation. These activity changes are associated with synaptic scaling, manifested in vitro by an increase in mEPSC amplitude and in vivo by an increase in spine size. Together, these data show that homeostatic activity changes occur in vivo in parallel with synaptic scaling."

However, little is known about how behavioral states modulate the intracellular activity of cortical neurons to effect changes in sensory responses. Here, we performed whole-cell recordings from neurons in upper-layer primary visual cortex of awake mice during locomotion and quiet wakefulness. We found that the signal-to-noise ratio for sensory responses was improved during locomotion by two mechanisms: (1) a decrease in membrane potential variability leading to a reduction in background firing rates and (2) an enhancement in the amplitude and reliability of visually evoked subthreshold responses mediated by an increase in total conductance and a depolarization of the stimulus-evoked reversal potential. Consistent with the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio for visual responses during locomotion, we demonstrate that performance is improved in a visual detection task during this behavioral state. The processing of sensory information varies widely across behavioral states.

Consistent with the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio for visual responses during locomotion, we demonstrate that performance is improved in a visual detection task during this behavioral state. Nearly a century ago it was first observed that global brain activity, measured by electroencephalography (EEG), exhibits distinct electrical patterns corresponding to overt behavioral states (e.g., sleep, relaxation, alertness) (Berger, 1929Berger H. Über das elektrenkephalogramm des menschen.Eur. Arch. Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1929; 87: 527-570Crossref Scopus (2377) Google Scholar, Loomis et al., 1935Loomis A.L. Harvey E.N. Hobart G. Potential rhythms of the cerebral cortex during sleep.Science. 1935; 81: 597-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that subthreshold activity can be tightly correlated with specific behavioral states. For example, intracellular recordings during slow-wave sleep have shown that the membrane potential of cortical neurons exhibits slow (<1 Hz, “up/down”) fluctuations that are suppressed during wakefulness (Steriade et al., 2001Steriade M. Timofeev I. Grenier F. Natural waking and sleep states: a view from inside neocortical neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 1969-1985PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, recent findings suggest that wakefulness itself may comprise multiple states characterized by distinct membrane potential dynamics (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C.

In mouse barrel cortex, periods of quiet wakefulness are associated with large-amplitude, correlated fluctuations in membrane potential that are attenuated during active whisking (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C. Correlating whisker behavior with membrane potential in barrel cortex of awake mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 608-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, Poulet and Petersen, 2008Poulet J.F. Petersen C.C. Internal brain state regulates membrane potential synchrony in barrel cortex of behaving mice.Nature. 2008; 454: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). These studies raise the possibility that distinct membrane potential dynamics may mediate state-dependent modes of sensory processing. Recent studies in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) have demonstrated that a particular behavioral state, locomotion, is correlated with increased responses to visual stimuli (Ayaz et al., 2013Ayaz A.

Biol. 2013; 23: 890-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Keller et al., 2012Keller G.B. Bonhoeffer T. Hübener M.

Stryker M.P. Modulation of visual responses by behavioral state in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). However, although these studies show a clear impact of behavioral state on spiking responses, the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. To identify the processes that affect neuronal responses during different behavioral states, it is important to study the membrane potential dynamics preceding the generation of action potentials in individual neurons (Petersen and Crochet, 2013Petersen C.C. Crochet S. Synaptic computation and sensory processing in neocortical layer 2/3.Neuron. 2013; 78: 28-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, Steriade et al., 2001Steriade M. Timofeev I. Grenier F. Natural waking and sleep states: a view from inside neocortical neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 1969-1985PubMed Google Scholar). To accomplish this, we performed whole-cell recordings from visual cortex in head-fixed mice allowed to run freely on a spherical treadmill (Dombeck et al., 2007Dombeck D.A. Khabbaz A.N. Collman F. Adelman T.L. Tank D.W. Imaging large-scale neural activity with cellular resolution in awake, mobile mice.Neuron. 2007; 56: 43-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). This approach allowed us to compare subthreshold cortical activity during two behavioral states: quiet wakefulness and locomotion. We found that locomotion was correlated with decreased membrane potential variability and an increase in the subthreshold response to visual stimulation. Together, these changes enhanced the neuronal signal-to-noise ratio during locomotion. Importantly, locomotion was also correlated with improved performance on a visual detection task, suggesting that the intracellular dynamics during quiet wakefulness and locomotion may impact visual perception. To determine whether locomotion and quiet wakefulness are associated with distinct membrane potential dynamics in V1 cortical neurons, we performed whole-cell recordings from upper-layer cortical cells in head-fixed mice during presentation of a uniform gray screen (Figure 1A). We defined quiet wakefulness as epochs for which the mean speed was <0.5 cm/s, and locomotion as epochs for which the mean speed was >1 cm/s, similar to thresholds used previously (Ayaz et al., 2013Ayaz A. Saleem A.B. Scholvinck M.L. Carandini M. Locomotion controls spatial integration in mouse visual cortex.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 890-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Niell and Stryker, 2010Niell C.M. Stryker M.P. Modulation of visual responses by behavioral state in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Eye movements were more frequent during locomotion and typically along the horizontal axis; however, the distributions of eye positions for the two states were highly overlapping and centered on a common default position (Figure S1 available online). During quiet wakefulness, cortical neurons displayed large-amplitude (∼20 mV), low-frequency (2–10 Hz) fluctuations that were attenuated during locomotion (Figures 1B–1E; Movie S1). To quantify this effect, we computed the variance in the membrane potential and the power in the 2–10 Hz frequency band for stationary and moving epochs (Figures 1D and 1F–1H). During locomotion, the membrane potential was less variable and power in the 2–10 Hz band was diminished by a factor of two (Figures 1G and 1H; Table 1). Interestingly, the membrane potential dynamics of V1 neurons during stationary and moving periods were qualitatively similar to those observed during quiet wakefulness and active whisking in the barrel cortex (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S.

However, despite this depolarization, spontaneous firing rates were suppressed during locomotion (Figure 1J; Table 1). We next investigated the mechanisms that underlie this decrease in spontaneous spiking. It has been shown that spike threshold is sensitive to both the mean and the derivative of the membrane potential preceding spike generation (Azouz and Gray, 2000Azouz R. Gray C.M. Dynamic spike threshold reveals a mechanism for synaptic coincidence detection in cortical neurons in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 8110-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, Azouz and Gray, 2003Azouz R. Gray C.M. Adaptive coincidence detection and dynamic gain control in visual cortical neurons in vivo.Neuron. 2003; 37: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Given the large-amplitude membrane potential fluctuations during quiet wakefulness, we hypothesized that the increase in spiking during stationary periods may reflect a hyperpolarization of the spike threshold. To compare the membrane potential dynamics preceding spike generation during stationary and moving epochs, we computed average spike waveforms for the two conditions (Figure 2A). As reported previously in anesthetized animals (Azouz and Gray, 2000Azouz R. Gray C.M. Dynamic spike threshold reveals a mechanism for synaptic coincidence detection in cortical neurons in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 8110-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, Azouz and Gray, 2003Azouz R. Gray C.M. Adaptive coincidence detection and dynamic gain control in visual cortical neurons in vivo.Neuron. 2003; 37: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we found that spike threshold was negatively correlated with the derivative of the membrane potential (dVm/dt) over the 10 ms preceding the spike (Figure 2B; rstat = −0.56, pstat < 0.005; rmov = −0.39, pmov < 0.005). However, although the membrane potential 100 ms before spike generation was significantly more hyperpolarized during stationary epochs (Figure 2C), dVm/dt was similar (Figure 2D), leading to nearly identical spike thresholds for the two conditions (Figure 2E). Furthermore, the maximum rate of rise during the action potential, a measure of the number of available voltage-gated sodium channels (Azouz and Gray, 2000Azouz R. Gray C.M. Dynamic spike threshold reveals a mechanism for synaptic coincidence detection in cortical neurons in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 8110-8115Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), was not different for stationary and moving epochs (Table 1). These results suggest that the increased spiking during stationary epochs does not reflect a difference in intrinsic excitability between the two states. We next tested whether the high-variance membrane potential dynamics during stationary epochs could produce more frequent spike-threshold crossings without reducing the threshold itself. Indeed, we found that the probability of both hyperpolarized and depolarized membrane potentials was higher for the stationary state (Figure 2F). To quantify this observation, we measured the probability that the membrane potential was within 5 mV of spike threshold (probability near threshold [PNT]) for stationary and moving epochs. For all cells tested, PNT was reduced during locomotion (Figure 2G; Figure S2; Table 1). Moreover, PNT was well correlated with the change in spike rate between the two conditions (Figure 2H; r = 0.87, p < 0.05). Together, these findings suggest that the large-amplitude membrane potential fluctuations during stationary epochs increase spiking, not by modulating intrinsic excitability but by increasing the fraction of time during which the membrane potential is near spike threshold. Several recent studies using extracellular recordings (Ayaz et al., 2013Ayaz A. Saleem A.B. Scholvinck M.L. Carandini M. Locomotion controls spatial integration in mouse visual cortex.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 890-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Niell and Stryker, 2010Niell C.M. Stryker M.P. Modulation of visual responses by behavioral state in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) and calcium imaging (Keller et al., 2012Keller G.B. Bonhoeffer T. Hübener M. Sensorimotor mismatch signals in primary visual cortex of the behaving mouse.Neuron. 2012; 74: 809-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that locomotion increases visually evoked spiking in mouse V1. To verify that visually evoked firing rates were similarly enhanced during locomotion for our experimental set-up, we performed juxtacellular recordings and measured the response of each cell to a brief (83 ms) flash of optimally oriented gratings (Figure S3A). Maximum responses to flashed gratings were consistently higher for moving than for stationary periods (Figures S3B and S3C; Table 1). We calculated the number of SDs that the maximum visual response rose above baseline for both behavioral states (Z score). The increase in response firing during locomotion, together with a decrease in background firing (Figure 1J, SU symbols), led to significantly higher Z scores for the visual response during locomotion (Figure S3D; Table 1). What intracellular mechanisms mediate the increase in stimulus-evoked spiking during locomotion? In principle, the mean depolarization during locomotion (Figure 1I) could produce higher stimulus-evoked firing with or without a concomitant change in the response amplitude. To test these possibilities, we recorded subthreshold responses to optimally oriented drifting sinusoidal gratings (16% contrast, ∼1.2 s) during stationary and moving epochs (Figure 3A). To better isolate subthreshold responses to visual stimulation, we suppressed the generation of action potentials by injecting hyperpolarizing current (resulting Vm: −82.7 ± 4.1 mV). We found that the amplitude of the response, averaged over the entire stimulus window, was significantly larger during locomotion (Figures 3B and 3E; Table 1). Indeed, in several cases (3/8), the visual response was only measurable during locomotion. To examine whether behavioral state modulates response variability, we calculated trial-to-trial correlations in the visual response for stationary and moving epochs. We observed a striking reduction in response variability during locomotion (Figure 3C), manifested as an increase in the mean correlation coefficient between trials (Figures 3D and 3E; Table 1). Additionally, the coefficient of variation (CV), computed for the peak response after the initial visual transient, was significantly reduced during moving epochs (Figure 3E; Table 1). Together, these metrics indicate that both the waveform and the amplitude of the visual response were more reliable during locomotion. The response to visual stimulation consists of excitatory and inhibitory inputs (Borg-Graham et al., 1998Borg-Graham L.J. Monier C. Frégnac Y.

To investigate the changes in excitatory (ge) and inhibitory (gi) conductances measured at the soma, we recorded intracellular responses to drifting sinusoidal gratings (100% contrast) under voltage clamp. Using a Cs+-based internal solution, we recorded visually evoked currents while maintaining the cell’s membrane at two holding potentials, +20 and −70 mV, to calculate ge and gi (see Experimental Procedures). Under these conditions, locomotion was correlated with an increase in both ge and gi for all cells tested (Figures 3F and 3G; Table 1). Interestingly, the balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) was also modulated by behavioral state, reflected by a depolarization in the reversal potential of the visually evoked conductances (Figure 3H; Table 1). Together, both an increase in total conductance and a shift in the E/I balance toward excitation would be expected to produce larger subthreshold depolarizations, consistent with our current-clamp data and the increased spiking during locomotion reported here and in previous studies (Figure S2; Ayaz et al., 2013Ayaz A. Saleem A.B. Scholvinck M.L. Carandini M. Locomotion controls spatial integration in mouse visual cortex.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 890-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Niell and Stryker, 2010Niell C.M. Stryker M.P. Modulation of visual responses by behavioral state in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). To examine whether the stationary and moving states are relevant for visual behavior, we trained mice to perform a visual detection task and analyzed their performance during the two conditions. Mice learned to lick for a water reward during the presentation of drifting gratings of varying contrasts (low: 9%/16%; medium: 27%/50%; high: 81%/100%) and to withhold licking for the presentation of a gray screen (Figures 4A and 4B ; Figures S4A and S4B). Injection of the GABAA-receptor agonist muscimol into V1 (n = 4) significantly impaired behavioral performance compared to saline controls (n = 4; Figure 4C; Figure S4C), indicating that the visual cortex was necessary for this task. Interestingly, locomotion was correlated with a significant increase in the hit rates for both low- and medium-contrast gratings. False alarm rates also increased during locomotion, though this effect was driven primarily by one animal and did not reach significance (Figure 4D; Table 2). An increase in hit rates could reflect an overall increase in licking and not improved perception. To distinguish between these possibilities, we computed the discriminability (d′) for each contrast (Figure 4E; Table 2), a metric that is invariant to the behavioral criterion (Wickens, 2002Wickens T.D. Elementary Signal Detection Theory. Oxford University Press, New York2002Google Scholar). For each mouse tested, d′ was enhanced during locomotion for the low-contrast condition; however, no significant effect was observed for the medium- and high-contrast conditions, likely reflecting a saturation of performance (Figure 4F; Table 2). Notably, moving trials were evenly distributed across the entire behavioral session (Figure S4D), and performance during the first and second halves of the sessions did not differ (p > 0.1, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Thus, the improvement in d′ during movement did not reflect a correlation between locomotion and motivation.Table 2Summary of Behavioral DataStationaryMovingnpFigureBehaviorFalse alarm rate0.28 ± 0.050.38 ± 0.0970.19Figure 4High-contrast hit rate0.91 ± 0.030.93 ± 0.0470.31Figure 4Medium-contrast hit rate0.83 ± 0.060.91 ± 0.0470.047Figure 4Low-contrast hit rate0.71 ± 0.070.83 ± 0.0770.031Figure 4High-contrast d′2.1 ± 0.192.1 ± 0.2871Figure 4Medium-contrast d′1.7 ± 0.241.9 ± 0.2670.297Figure 4Low-contrast d′1.2 ± 0.231.5 ± 0.2570.0156Figure 4 Open table in a new tab Here we present three main findings. First, we show large-amplitude, low-frequency membrane potential fluctuations in V1 during quiet wakefulness that are abolished during locomotion. This decrease in membrane potential variability results in reduced spontaneous firing rates during locomotion. Second, we demonstrate that locomotion was correlated with an increase in both the amplitude and reliability of the subthreshold response to visual stimuli. This enhanced response was mediated by an increase in visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory conductance and a shift in the E/I balance toward excitation. Finally, we show that locomotion is correlated with improved performance in a visual detection task, as might be predicted from our physiological results. Together, these findings provide intracellular mechanisms for state-dependent improvement in sensory coding in the awake animal. Synchronous, low-frequency activity during quiescence and sleep have long been observed by EEG and local field potential (LFP) recordings. However, the connection between these measurements of brain activity and intracellular dynamics has only recently been explored (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C.

Timofeev I. Grenier F. Natural waking and sleep states: a view from inside neocortical neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 1969-1985PubMed Google Scholar). To date, high-variance membrane potential fluctuations during wakefulness have only been reported in the barrel cortex, where they emerge during periods of quiet wakefulness, i.e., when the animal is not actively whisking. Given the established role of the barrel cortex in not only sensing but also generating whisker movements (Matyas et al., 2010Matyas F. Sreenivasan V. Marbach F. Wacongne C. Barsy B. Mateo C. Aronoff R. Petersen C.C. Motor control by sensory cortex.Science. 2010; 330: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), it was unclear whether these dynamics were a unique feature of the rodent whisker system. However, by extending these findings to another sensory cortex, our data suggest that high- and low-variance membrane potential dynamics may represent distinct sensory processing modes, conserved across diverse brain areas. A recent study has shown that locomotion is correlated with both a reduction in low-frequency power in the LFP and enhanced visual responses (Niell and Stryker, 2010Niell C.M. Stryker M.P. Modulation of visual responses by behavioral state in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Here we report a similar enhancement in spiking responses during locomotion and uncover the cellular mechanisms that underlie this effect. Specifically, we demonstrate that subthreshold visual responses are larger and more reliable during locomotion due to an increase in excitatory and inhibitory conductance and a depolarization in the visually evoked reversal potential. It has been suggested that the brain state observed during locomotion and other active behaviors in the rodent (Crochet and Petersen, 2006Crochet S. Petersen C.C. Correlating whisker behavior with membrane potential in barrel cortex of awake mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 608-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, Niell and Stryker, 2010Niell C.M.

Naim A. Lampl I. The subthreshold relation between cortical local field potential and neuronal firing unveiled by intracellular recordings in awake rats.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4440-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) may be analogous to the brain state observed in primates during selective attention (Harris and Thiele, 2011Harris K.D. Thiele A. Cortical state and attention.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). While the increase in firing rate and reduction in trial-to-trial reliability during attention are well established (Noudoost et al., 2010Noudoost B. Chang M.H. Steinmetz N.A. Moore T. Top-down control of visual attention.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects are not known. We propose that an increase in synaptic conductance, a shift in the E/I balance, and a reduction in spontaneous membrane potential variability may represent general principles that contribute to enhanced sensory coding, not only during locomotion but in a wide variety of behavioral states including attention. We argue that the signal-to-noise ratio for sensory responses during locomotion is improved in part by a decrease in spontaneous firing. A number of other studies using extracellular recordings have reported a similar reduction in spontaneous firing during desynchronized brain states (Livingstone and Hubel, 1981Livingstone M.S. Hubel D.H. Effects of sleep and arousal on the processing of visual information in the cat.Nature. 1981; 291: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, Sakata and Harris, 2012Sakata S. Harris K.D. Laminar-dependent effects of cortical state on auditory cortical spontaneous activity.Front. Neural Circuits. 2012; 6: 109Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here, we extend these findings by showing that this decrease in spiking results from a reduction in membrane potential variance and not a state-dependent modulation of intrinsic excitability. Given that the effect of desynchronized states on spiking activity may depend on laminar position and cell-type identity (de Kock and Sakmann, 2009de Kock C.P. Sakmann B.

Laminar-dependent effects of cortical state on auditory cortical spontaneous activity.Front. Neural Circuits. 2012; 6: 109Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to investigate how the subthreshold dynamics we report here vary across different classes of neurons. Notably, the decrease in spontaneous spiking during locomotion that we report here was not observed in three recent studies in mouse visual cortex, likely reflecting differences in experimental design (Ayaz et al., 2013Ayaz A. Saleem A.B. Scholvinck M.L. Carandini M. Locomotion controls spatial integration in mouse visual cortex.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: 890-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Keller et al., 2012Keller G.B. Bonhoeffer T. Hübener M.

Stryker M.P. Modulation of visual responses by behavioral state in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 65: 472-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Niell and Stryker report no change in spontaneous spiking during locomotion; however, they measure spontaneous activity during relatively brief intervals between visual stimuli, and thus their estimates may be influenced by previous visual responses. Keller et al. report increased Ca2+ signals during locomotion; however, as the authors note, their data is probably biased toward cells with high firing rates and strong Ca2+ signals, a class of cells that we may not sample at the same rate. Finally, Ayaz et al. report an increase in spontaneous firing during locomotion. However, they record primarily from the lower layers (L4 and L5), where state-dependent modulation of spontaneous activity may differ. Importantly, we demonstrate that both the balance of excitation and inhibition and the total conductance for sensory responses depend on behavioral state. This finding represents a divergence from the canonical view that excitation and inhibition are recruited proportionally (Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011Isaacson J.S. Scanziani M. How inhibition shapes cortical activity.Neuron. 2011; 72: 231-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Though we used a Cs+-based internal solution and analyzed only time-averaged conductances, the visually evoked conductances we report here are undoubtedly underestimates of the true conductances due to poor dendritic space clamp (Williams and Mitchell, 2008Williams S.R. Mitchell S.J. Direct measurement of somatic voltage clamp errors in central neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, though the absolute magnitudes of excitatory and inhibitory conductances are sensitive to poor space clamp, the relative shift in the balance of excitation and inhibition between behavioral states is less likely to reflect this error. How might behavioral state uncouple excitatory and inhibitory conductances? It has been shown that neuromodulators such as noradrenaline and acetylcholine may impact cortical processing by targeting specific cell types and synapses (Kawaguchi and Shindou, 1998Kawaguchi Y. Shindou T. Noradrenergic excitation and inhibition of GABAergic cell types in rat frontal cortex.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6963-6976PubMed Google Scholar, Picciotto et al., 2012Picciotto M.R.

Acetylcholine as a neuromodulator: cholinergic signaling shapes nervous system function and behavior.Neuron. 2012; 76: 116-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). For example, by activating inhibitory interneurons, noradrenaline might shift inhibitory synapses into a state of synaptic depression, limiting feedforward inhibition in response to sensory stimuli (Kawaguchi and Shindou, 1998Kawaguchi Y. Shindou T. Noradrenergic excitation and inhibition of GABAergic cell types in rat frontal cortex.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6963-6976PubMed Google Scholar, Kuo and Trussell, 2011Kuo S.P. Trussell L.O. Spontaneous spiking and synaptic depression underlie noradrenergic control of feed-forward inhibition.Neuron. 2011; 71: 306-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additionally, acetylcholine has been shown to enhance the efficacy of thalamocortical synapses onto excitatory cells while suppressing local inhibitory synapses (Disney et al., 2007Disney A.A. Aoki C. Hawken M.J. Gain modulation by nicotine in macaque v1.Neuron. 2007; 56: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, Gil et al., 1999Gil Z. Connors B.W.

Perisomatic GABA release and thalamocortical integration onto neocortical excitatory cells are regulated by neuromodulators.Neuron. 2008; 58: 911-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Given that putative cholinergic and noradrenergic projection neurons exhibit increased firing rates during movement (Buzsaki et al., 1988Buzsaki G. Bickford R.G. Ponomareff G. Thal L.J. Mandel R. Gage F.H. Nucleus basalis and thalamic control of neocortical activity in the freely moving rat.J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4007-4026PubMed Google Scholar) and behavioral state transitions (Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981Aston-Jones G. Bloom F.E. Activity of norepinephrine-containing locus coeruleus neurons in behaving rats anticipates fluctuations in the sleep-waking cycle.J. Neurosci. 1981; 1: 876-886PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, it is possible that these ascending neuromodulatory systems may contribute to the state-dependent modulation of visually evoked conductances shown here. What is the function of high- and low-variance brain states? The prevalence of slow, synchronous activity in EEG recordings during contemplative or internally directed mental states (Schacter, 1977Schacter D.L. EEG theta waves and psychological phenomena: a review and analysis.Biol. Psychol. 1977; 5: 47-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) suggests that low-frequency fluctuations may facilitate intracortical interactions. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that cortical replay of a learned sensory sequence was enhanced during periods of quiet wakefulness, when the LFP power was concentrated in the low-frequency band (Xu et al., 2012Xu S. Jiang W. Poo M.M. Dan Y. Activity recall in a visual cortical ensemble.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). By coordinating spiking in discrete temporal windows, low-frequency fluctuations could magnify postsynaptic responses and facilitate spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Conversely, by suppressing fluctuations that are not synchronized with sensory-evoked activity, the low-variance state could improve the fidelity of sensory representations. Indeed, we found that both the amplitude and the waveform of visual responses were more reliable during the low-variance state. Such an improvement in sensory coding might be important during sensory-guided behaviors that depend on an efficient and reliable response to environmental stimuli. All procedures were approved by the Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care at Stanford University. Headplates were centered over V1 on the left hemisphere, and mice were given at least 2 days to recover before habituation to the spherical treadmill (∼3 days). A <200 μm craniotomy was made over monocular V1, and recordings were obtained using standard blind patching techniques. Only recordings at a depth of less than 400 μm were included in this study. All recordings were corrected for a junction potential of −10 mV. Visual stimuli were presented on gamma-corrected LED monitors (60 Hz refresh rate, ∼75 cd/m2) placed 30 cm from the mouse and subtending ∼90° of visual space. Stimuli were full-screen sinusoidal gratings (0.05 cycles/degree, 40°/s). Moving and stationary epochs were identified as periods during which the speed was greater than 1 cm/s and less than 0.5 cm/s, respectively. Membrane potential power spectra, resting potential, spike rate, and membrane potential variance were calculated for 500 ms segments and averaged to obtain stationary and moving values. For current-clamp experiments in Figure 3, response amplitude and trial-to-trial correlations were calculated over the entire stimulus window (∼1.2 s duration). The coefficient of variation was calculated for a 100 ms window centered on the mean response peak after the initial visual transient. For voltage-clamp experiments in Figure 3, visual responses were recorded at +20 mV and −70 mV, and ge and gi were calculated over the stimulus window (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). All paired statistical comparisons were performed with the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Nonpaired comparisons were performed with the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All analysis was performed in MATLAB. To categorize behavioral trials as stationary or moving, we analyzed the 500 ms before stimulus onset. Data from six behavioral sessions were combined and analyzed. The cortical inactivation experiment was performed over 4 days. Baseline performance was measured over the first 2 days, a craniotomy was performed on the third day, and either muscimol (4.4 mM; ∼400 nl) or saline was injected on the fourth day (saline cohort: n = 4; muscimol cohort: n = 4). Performance was normalized to the mean performance on days 1 and 2. We would like to thank Xiaoting Wang for helping to train mice on the visual detection task.

https://openalex.org/W2008218423,"We analyzed four families that presented with a similar condition characterized by congenital microcephaly, intellectual disability, progressive cerebral atrophy, and intractable seizures. We show that recessive mutations in the ASNS gene are responsible for this syndrome. Two of the identified missense mutations dramatically reduce ASNS protein abundance, suggesting that the mutations cause loss of function. Hypomorphic Asns mutant mice have structural brain abnormalities, including enlarged ventricles and reduced cortical thickness, and show deficits in learning and memory mimicking aspects of the patient phenotype. ASNS encodes asparagine synthetase, which catalyzes the synthesis of asparagine from glutamine and aspartate. The neurological impairment resulting from ASNS deficiency may be explained by asparagine depletion in the brain or by accumulation of aspartate/glutamate leading to enhanced excitability and neuronal damage. Our study thus indicates that asparagine synthesis is essential for the development and function of the brain but not for that of other organs."

Here, we describe the genetic incorporation of a photoreactive Uaa into the pore of an inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1. The Uaa occluded the pore, rendering the channel nonconducting, and, on brief light illumination, was released to permit outward K+ current. Expression of this photoinducible inwardly rectifying potassium (PIRK) channel in rat hippocampal neurons created a light-activatable PIRK switch for suppressing neuronal firing. We also expanded the genetic code of mammals to express PIRK channels in embryonic mouse neocortex in vivo and demonstrated a light-activated PIRK current in cortical neurons.

Expression of this photoinducible inwardly rectifying potassium (PIRK) channel in rat hippocampal neurons created a light-activatable PIRK switch for suppressing neuronal firing. We also expanded the genetic code of mammals to express PIRK channels in embryonic mouse neocortex in vivo and demonstrated a light-activated PIRK current in cortical neurons. These principles could be generally expanded to other proteins expressed in the brain to enable optical regulation. The ability to control protein function with light provides excellent temporal and spatial resolution for precise investigation in vitro and in vivo and, thus, is having significant impact on neuroscience. For example, naturally light-sensitive opsin channels and pumps have been exploited to excite or inhibit neurons, enabling specific modulation of selected cells and circuits in diverse model organisms (Bernstein and Boyden, 2011Bernstein J.G.

However, since this approach relies on the ectopic expression of an exogenous or chimera protein requiring retinal as the chromophore, it cannot be applied to control a particular endogenous protein. Another elegant method engineers light responsiveness into endogenous receptors and channels by chemically tethering a photoswitchable azobenzene-coupled ligand (Szobota and Isacoff, 2010Szobota S. Isacoff E.Y. Optical control of neuronal activity.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 39: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ligand is presented or withdrawn from the binding site of the protein through the photoisomerization of the azobenzene moiety. This approach cannot address proteins that are expressed but failed to conjugate with the azobenzene-coupled ligand, and ligand tethering has been limited to the extracellular side of membrane proteins, excluding the intracellular side and intracellular proteins. Photoresponsive unnatural amino acids (Uaas) provide another flexible avenue for optical control of protein activities. Microinjection of tRNAs chemically acylated with Uaas allows the incorporation of photocaging groups into receptors and ion channels in Xenopus oocytes, which have revealed novel insights on their structure and function (England et al., 1997England P.M.

Genetically encoding Uaas with orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pairs enables the Uaa to be incorporated into proteins with high protein yields in mammalian cells and organisms (Liu and Schultz, 2010Liu C.C.

Xiang Z. Miller B. Louie G. Wang W. Noel J.P. Gage F.H. Wang L.

Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A challenge in the neuroscience field, however, has been the application of Uaa technology in mammalian neurons in vitro and, ultimately, in the mouse brain in vivo. Here, we demonstrate the optical control of a neuronal protein in vitro and in vivo using a genetically encoded photoreactive Uaa. Kir2.1 is a strong inwardly rectifying potassium channel that is crucial in regulating neuronal excitability, action potential cessation, hormone secretion, heart rate, and salt balance (Bichet et al., 2003Bichet D. Haass F.A. Jan L.Y. Merging functional studies with structures of inward-rectifier K(+) channels.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We incorporated 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl-cysteine (Cmn) into the pore of Kir2.1, generating a photoactivatable inwardly rectifying potassium (which we refer to as PIRK) channel. Light activation of PIRK channels expressed in rat hippocampal neurons suppressed neuronal firing. In addition, we expressed PIRK channels in embryonic mouse neocortex, measured light-activated PIRK current in cortical neurons, and showed the potential for its use in other brain regions such as diencephalon, demonstrating the successful implementation of the Uaa technology in vivo in the mammalian brain. Genetically encoding Uaas has no limitations on protein type and location (Wang and Schultz, 2004Wang L. Schultz P.G. Expanding the genetic code.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 44: 34-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), and photocaging is compatible with modulating various proteins (Adams and Tsien, 1993Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Controlling cell chemistry with caged compounds.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 755-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, Fehrentz et al., 2011Fehrentz T. Schönberger M. Trauner D. Optochemical genetics.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2011; 50: 12156-12182Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We therefore expect that our method can be generally applied to other brain proteins, enabling optical investigation of a range of channels, receptors, and signaling proteins in the brain. Potassium ions flow through the central pore of Kir2.1 channels (Ishii et al., 1994Ishii K. Yamagishi T. Taira N. Cloning and functional expression of a cardiac inward rectifier K+ channel.FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Kubo et al., 1993Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Primary structure and functional expression of a mouse inward rectifier potassium channel.Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). We reasoned that incorporation of a Uaa with a bulky side chain might occlude the channel pore and restrict current flow. Photolysis of the Uaa would enable release of the bulky side chain moiety and restore current flow through the channel, thus creating a PIRK channel (Figure 1A). Ideally, a natural amino acid residue can be regenerated from the Uaa after photolysis, minimizing potential perturbation to protein structure and function. Cmn is a perfect Uaa for constructing a PIRK channel. The dimethoxynitrobenzyl group of Cmn is readily hydrolyzed by UV light, releasing the cage group and becoming Cys (Figure 1B; Figure S2A available online) (Rhee et al., 2008Rhee H. Lee J.S. Lee J. Joo C. Han H. Cho M. Photolytic control and infrared probing of amide I mode in the dipeptide backbone-caged with the 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl group.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2008; 112: 2128-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Compared to the conventional photocaging o-nitrobenzyl group, the dimethoxynitrobenzyl group is bulkier and has a higher quantum yield to facilitate photolysis. Previously, 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl serine was incorporated into the transcription factor Pho4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to control phosphorylation with light (Lemke et al., 2007Lemke E.A. Summerer D. Geierstanger B.H. Brittain S.M. Schultz P.G. Control of protein phosphorylation with a genetically encoded photocaged amino acid.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Based on the similar structure and characteristics between serine and cysteine, we hypothesized that the orthogonal tRNACUALeu /synthetase pair evolved in yeast to incorporate 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl serine might also selectively incorporate Cmn. Indeed, Cmn was efficiently incorporated into proteins in mammalian cells by this pair, which we refer to as tRNACUALeu /CmnRS for clarity. Cmn was chosen for incorporation because multiple sites of Kir2.1 are found permissive for Cys mutation, and the sulfhydryl group of Cys also provides a chemically reactive functionality for possible secondary modifications if required. To achieve photoactivation of Kir2.1 using Cmn, we considered the following criteria for identifying a target site for incorporation into the channel protein: (1) the site should reside in the channel pore where the side chain of Cmn would face the pore lumen and be easily removed following photocleavage; (2) the pore should be large enough to accommodate four Cmn molecules in a Kir2.1 tetramer without disrupting protein folding but become small enough after Cmn incorporation to efficiently inhibit ion current flow; and (3) a site where a Cys mutation would not likely interfere with Kir2.1 function. Using published data on Kir2.1 pore topology and function (Kubo et al., 1993Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Previous studies indicated that Cys substitution at T142, I143, D172, I176, A184, or E224 did not interfere with Kir2.1 function (Dart et al., 1998Dart C. Leyland M.L. Spencer P.J. Stanfield P.R.

Therefore, these six amino acids plus C149 and C169 were selected for Cmn incorporation (Figure 2A; Figures S1A and S1B). The codon for these candidate sites was first mutated to the amber stop codon TAG to generate eight different mutant Kir2.1 (Kir2.1TAG) genes. The Kir2.1TAG cDNA was individually coexpressed with the orthogonal tRNACUALeu/CmnRS pair in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells. On exogenous addition of the Uaa Cmn to growth media, the CmnRS aminoacylates Cmn on to the tRNACUALeu, which, in turn, recognizes the amber stop codon (UAG) in Kir2.1 mRNA and incorporates Cmn into Kir2.1 protein during translation (Wang et al., 2001Wang L. Brock A. Herberich B. Schultz P.G. Expanding the genetic code of Escherichia coli.Science. 2001; 292: 498-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar, Wang and Schultz, 2004Wang L. Schultz P.G. Expanding the genetic code.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 44: 34-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Each candidate site was initially tested whether it was permissive for UAG suppression by the orthogonal tRNACUALeu/leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) pair, which incorporates the natural amino acid leucine (Leu). Each Kir2.1TAG gene was transfected into HEK293T cells along with the tRNACUALeu/LeuRS (Figure 2B). The gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) engineered with an amber stop codon at Tyr182 (GFP_Y182TAG) was cotransfected (Wang et al., 2007Wang W. Takimoto J.K. Louie G.V. Baiga T.J. Noel J.P. Lee K.F. Slesinger P.A. Wang L. Genetically encoding unnatural amino acids for cellular and neuronal studies.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). GFP fluorescence would indicate the successful suppression of the UAG stop codon by the orthogonal tRNA/synthetase. The function of individual Kir2.1TAG channels was then determined by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from GFP-positive cells. For example, a green-positive HEK293T cell transfected with Kir2.1_C169TAG and the tRNACUALeu/LeuRS produced a basally active inwardly rectifying current that was inhibited by extracellular Ba2+ (IKir), similar to wild-type Kir2.1 channels (Figure 2C). Of the eight candidate sites, IKir currents measured at −100 mV from HEK293T cells expressing Kir2.1_I143TAG, Kir2.1_C149TAG, Kir2.1_C169TAG, or Kir2.1_I176TAG were significantly larger than those from untransfected cells (Figure 2D), indicating successful suppression and incorporation of Leu. If a functional Kir2.1 channel could be generated through Leu incorporation at the TAG site, then it seemed likely that the same site would be compatible for the larger Uaa Cmn. We therefore tested Kir2.1_I143TAG, Kir2.1_C149TAG, Kir2.1_C169TAG, and Kir2.1_I176TAG for functional incorporation of Cmn (Figures 2E–2H; Figure S1C). HEK293T cells were transfected with cDNAs for the Kir2.1TAG channel, tRNACUALeu/CmnRS and the GFP_Y182TAG reporter (Figure 2B), and incubated in Cmn (1 mM) for 12–24 hr. Functional incorporation of Cmn was expected to lead to either a basally active IKir or an IKir that is revealed upon brief (1 s) light illumination (385 nm at 40 mW/cm2). For HEK293T cells expressing Kir2.1_I143TAG or Kir2.1_I176TAG, we could detect no IKir before or after light illumination, indicating either no amber suppression or a nonfunctional channel after Cmn incorporation (Figure 2E; Figure S1C). By contrast, HEK293T cells expressing Kir2.1_C149TAG displayed a large IKir that was unchanged by light illumination (Figure 2F), suggesting that incorporation of Cmn at C149 did not significantly occlude the pore. It is striking that HEK293T cells expressing Kir2.1_C169TAG displayed little IKir at negative membrane potentials that increased significantly upon light illumination (Figures 2G and 2H). These results suggested that incorporation of Cmn at C169 largely occludes the channel pore and that the blocking particle is released following brief light stimulation, indicating the successful construction of a photoactivatable Kir2.1 channel. We next examined the light sensitivity features of Kir2.1_C169TAGCmn (referred to as PIRK) channels expressed in HEK293T cells. To enhance channel expression, we fused the fluorescent protein mCitrine (mCit) to the C terminus of Kir2.1_C169TAG (Figure 3A), which reduced the number of plasmids needed for transfection and allowed tracking the location of PIRK channels. Fusion of GFP to the C terminus of Kir2.1 was shown previously to not affect Kir2.1 channel physiology (Sekar et al., 2007Sekar R.B. Kizana E. Smith R.R. Barth A.S. Zhang Y. Marbán E. Tung L. Lentiviral vector-mediated expression of GFP or Kir2.1 alters the electrophysiology of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes without inducing cytotoxicity.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 293: H2757-H2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Addition of Cmn to the bath resulted in fluorescently labeled HEK293T cells (Figure 3B; Figure S2A) and the expression of full-length Kir2.1-GFP fusion protein (Figure S2B). A brief (1 s) pulse of UV light (385 nm LED, 40 mW/cm2) led to activation of an inwardly rectifying current that was blocked by Ba2+ (Figures 3C and 3D). The activation kinetics had fast and slow components with time constants (τ) of 298 ± 134 ms and 15.0 ± 4.3 s, respectively (n = 7). Note that the amplitude of light-activated current is larger than that in Figure 2H, indicating that PIRK expression level increased with the two plasmid system. When incorporated with Leu, Kir2.1_C169TAGLeu channels showed large IKir (8.30 ± 1.48 nA, n = 7), which was not affected by light illumination (data not shown). On the other hand, HEK293T cells expressing PIRK (Kir2.1_C169TAGCmn) channels produced no or negligible IKir before UV light (0.14 ± 0.07 nA, n = 10 versus 0.05 ± 0.02 nA, n = 9 for untransfected; p > 0.05, unpaired t test) and a marked increase in IKir after UV light (1.65 ± 0.41 nA, n = 10) (Figure 3E). The smaller IKir for PIRK compared to Kir2.1_C169TAGLeu was likely due to the less efficient aminoacylation with CmnRS and, therefore, less Cmn incorporation. To investigate the relationship between the light dosage and current activation, we varied the duration and frequency of UV light pulses. Single light pulses with different lengths were applied to cells expressing PIRK channels. Using a 40 mW/cm2 LED light source, 1 s and 500 ms light pulses evoked similar amounts of current at −100 mV (2.27 ± 0.51 nA, n = 5 for 1 s; 2.04 ± 0.39 nA, n = 5 for 500 ms). Shorter UV pulses (200 ms, 100 ms, and 50 ms) led to progressively smaller currents (Figure 3F). No significant change in current amplitude was measured with a single 20 ms light pulse (n = 6; data not shown). We next investigated the effect of sequential UV light pulses. Sequentially delivered light pulses of 200 ms duration each led to stepwise activation of PIRK channels (Figure 3G). Fewer UV pulses were required to maximally activate PIRK channels with UV light pulses of longer duration (Figure 3H). Together, these results illustrate that modulating the duration and number of light pulses can be used to fine-tune the extent of PIRK current activation. A significant obstacle in using Uaa technology has been the implementation of Uaa in vertebrate neurons. We therefore investigated the expression of PIRK channels in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. Transfection of rat hippocampal primary neurons with the cDNA for PIRK-mCit and tRNACUALeu/CmnRS (Figure 3A) led to fluorescence in cultures exposed to Cmn for 12–48 hr (Figure 4A), indicating the successful incorporation of Cmn into PIRK channels. The expression of PIRK in neurons appeared similar to the pattern of endogenous Kir2.1 channels (Figure S3). Moreover, PIRK expression did not appear to change the basic membrane properties of the neurons (Figures S4A–S4C). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from mCit-positive neurons revealed no significant increase in basal inward current at negative potentials (−0.21 ± 0.06 nA, n = 6 versus −0.43 ± 0.09 nA, n = 6; p > 0.05, unpaired t test). However, UV light stimulation (1 s, 40 mW/cm2) induced a large inwardly rectifying current in PIRK (+Cmn) cells (Figure 4B). By contrast, control neurons without PIRK showed little or no response to UV light (Figures 4B and 4C; Figure S4D). In PIRK-expressing neurons incubated with Cmn, UV light induced a mean inward current of −0.46 ± 0.18 nA (at −100 mV), consistent with unblock of constitutively open Kir2.1 channels (Figure 4C, Supplemental Information). We next examined the effect of PIRK activation on the excitability of hippocampal neurons. Activation of an inwardly rectifying K+ current would be expected to significantly reduce neuronal excitability by the outward flow of K+ current through Kir channels (Burrone et al., 2002Burrone J. O’Byrne M. Murthy V.N. Multiple forms of synaptic plasticity triggered by selective suppression of activity in individual neurons.Nature. 2002; 420: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2004Yu C.R. Power J. Barnea G. O’Donnell S. Brown H.E. Osborne J. Axel R. Gogos J.A. Spontaneous neural activity is required for the establishment and maintenance of the olfactory sensory map.Neuron. 2004; 42: 553-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In whole-cell current-clamp recordings, a range of current injections (range = 10–190 pA, mean ± SEM, 45 ± 4 pA, n = 56) were used to induce continuous firing of action potentials (5–15 Hz) in both control neurons and PIRK-expressing neurons (Figures 4D and 4E). The induced membrane potential was relatively consistent from cell to cell (Figure 4G). In PIRK-expressing neurons, action potential firing stopped abruptly upon brief UV light stimulation (1 s, 40 mW/cm2). Of note, addition of Ba2+ to the bath restored action potential firing (Figure 4D), confirming that the observed suppression of activity was due to activation of Kir2.1 channels. Neither light illumination nor Ba2+ addition altered the excitability of control neurons (Figure 4E; Figures S4E and S4F). In multiple recordings from different preparations of hippocampal neuronal cultures, we consistently observed a significant decrease in firing frequency in PIRK-expressing neurons (+Cmn) following UV light, which was restored to normal levels of firing in the presence of extracellular Ba2+ (Figure 4F). In control neurons, we observed no significant change in firing frequency after light activation or Ba2+ addition (Figure 4F). Plotting the membrane potential induced by the current step before and after UV light stimulation showed a clear hyperpolarization in PIRK-expressing (+Cmn) neurons following UV light (Figure 4G; Figure S4H). Furthermore, subsequent extracellular Ba2+ reproducibly depolarized the membrane potential. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that UV light activation of PIRK channels provides a technique for spatially inhibiting neuronal activity through membrane hyperpolarization. To explore the dynamic range of PIRK’s effect on neuronal firing, we measured the firing frequency from each neuron over a range of current injections (0–70 pA). Cells that did not fire throughout the current range were excluded. With small current injections (<40 pA), the firing frequency decreased significantly upon UV light activation of PIRK channels (Figure 5A). With larger current injections (40–70 pA) and higher firing frequencies, however, there was no significant change in firing frequency following UV light illumination of PIRK-expressing neurons. This ceiling effect can be explained by the native properties of strong inwardly rectifying Kir2.1 channels, which conduct little outward current at positive membrane potentials (Ishii et al., 1994Ishii K.

Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Primary structure and functional expression of a mouse inward rectifier potassium channel.Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Kir channels are well known for their ability to hyperpolarize membranes and increase the threshold for firing an action potential. To examine this, we measured the minimum amount of current required to evoke an action potential (referred to as rheobase). The rheobase increased in PIRK-expressing neurons following UV light exposure (Figure 5C). UV light activation of PIRK also hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential of PIRK-expressing neurons by −17 mV, whereas UV light had no effect on the resting potential of control neurons (Figure 5D; Figure S4G). Having successfully expressed PIRK channels in dissociated hippocampal neurons, we next attempted to express PIRK channels in vivo. Genetically encoding Uaas using orthogonal tRNA/synthetase has great potential to address challenging biological questions in vivo, but this technology has yet to be applied in mammals. There were two main challenges for in vivo incorporation of Uaas in mammals: (1) efficient delivery and expression of the genes for the orthogonal tRNA/synthetase and the target protein into specific tissue or cells; and (2) sufficient bioavailability of the Uaa at the target tissue and cells. We chose mouse embryos for genetically incorporating Uaas into the brain because of the ability to introduce cDNA and chemicals in utero and then to prepare brain slices pre- and postnatally (Mulder et al., 2008Mulder J.

Here, we show by analyzing synaptopHluorin fluorescence that 200 action potentials evoke the same cumulative amount of vesicle fusion, irrespective of the frequency of stimulation (5-40 Hz), implying the absence of vesicle reuse, since the method used (alkaline-trapping) measures only first-round exocytosis. After blocking all slow or specifically clathrin-mediated endocytosis, however, the same stimulation patterns cause a rapid stimulation-frequency-dependent release depression. This form of depression does not reflect insufficient vesicle supply, but appears to be the result of slow clearance of vesicular components from the release site. Our findings uncover an important yet overlooked role of endocytic proteins for release site clearance in addition to their well-characterized role in endocytosis itself."

They are related by sequence and structural homology to mammalian lipid transport and plant abscisic acid receptor proteins and are predicted to have cavities for ligand binding. Recently, three new members of the PR-10 family, the Fra a proteins, have been identified in strawberry, where they are required for the activity of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, which is essential for the development of color and flavor in fruits. Here, we show that Fra a proteins bind natural flavonoids with different selectivity and affinities in the low μm range. The structural analysis of Fra a 1 E and a Fra a 3-catechin complex indicates that loops L3, L5, and L7 surrounding the ligand-binding cavity show significant flexibility in the apo forms but close over the ligand in the Fra a 3-catechin complex. Our findings provide mechanistic insight on the function of Fra a proteins and suggest that PR-10 proteins, which are widespread in plants, may play a role in the control of secondary metabolic pathways by binding to metabolic intermediates.

However, the functional relevance of these interactions remains unclear. Recently, three new members of the PR-10 family, Fra a 1E, Fra a 2, and Fra a 3, have been identified and shown to play an important role in the control of phenylpropanoids and flavonoids biosynthesis in strawberry fruits (26Karlsson A.L.

Thus, injury by pathogens or pests induces the accumulation of flavonoids and other phenolic compounds with antimicrobial activity (34Ahuja I. Kissen R. Bones A.M. Phytoalexins in defense against pathogens.Trends Plant Sci. 2012; 17: 73-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Flavonoids are also exuded by plant roots and act as signals that modify the transcriptional activity of nodulation genes in nitrogen-fixing bacteria, thereby promoting symbiotic association (35Kobayashi H. Naciri-Graven Y. Broughton W.J. Perret X. Flavonoids induce temporal shifts in gene-expression of nod-box controlled loci in Rhizobium sp. NGR234.Mol.

Post-transcriptional silencing of flavonol synthase mRNA in tobacco leads to fruits with arrested seed set.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e28315Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The effect of dietary flavonoids in human health is also a subject of study due to their antioxidative and anticarcinogenic activities (38Ghasemzadeh A. Ghasemzadeh N. Flavonoids and phenolic acids: role and biochemical activity in plants and human.J. Med. Plants Res. 2011; 5: 6697-6703Google Scholar). Flavonoids are synthesized via the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways (see Fig. 1) (30Fraser C.M. Chapple C. The phenylpropanoid pathway in Arabidopsis.Arabidopsis Book. 2011; 9: e0152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Vogt T. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.Mol. Plant. 2010; 3: 2-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). The first step in the phenylpropanoid pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and leads to the production of cinnamic acid from l-phenylalanine. PAL is the gateway enzyme to the synthesis of phenolic and flavonoid compounds as well as many other secondary metabolites (32Vogt T. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.Mol. Plant. 2010; 3: 2-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis and other species, PAL gene expression is responsive to developmental and environmental clues such as wounding, pathogen infection, or UV radiation, among others (39Huang J. Gu M. Lai Z. Fan B. Shi K. Zhou Y.H. Yu J.Q. Chen Z.

Plant Physiol. 2008; 165: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Another important step in the synthesis of flavonoids is the production of naringenin, which is the first product in the pathway with a flavan structure and from which many other flavonoids are derived (see Fig. 1). This step is catalyzed by the enzyme chalcone synthase. Many of the final products of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway accumulate as O-glycosyl derivatives at the position 3 of the C ring of the flavan nucleus and are accumulated in the vacuole or secreted through the plasma membrane into the apoplastic space (44Zhao J. Dixon R.A. The “ins” and “outs” of flavonoid transport.Trends Plant Sci. 2010; 15: 72-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). A number of flavonoids that account for color of the fruit and contribute significantly to its taste are produced in the strawberry fruit in a developmental-specific pattern (29Fait A. Hanhineva K. Beleggia R. Dai N. Rogachev I. Nikiforova V.J. Fernie A.R. Aharoni A.

Food Chem. 2011; 59: 12598-12604Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) are mostly produced in the young fruits that make them bitter, whereas anthocyanins, mostly pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (see Fig. 1), which confer color, are abundant in the later stages of fruit maturation. The strawberry Fra a transcripts are present in most plant organs; however, they show maximal expression levels in open flowers, fruits, and roots, depending on the member of the family (28Muñoz C. Hoffmann T. Escobar N.M. Ludemann F. Botella M.A. Valpuesta V. Schwab W. The strawberry fruit Fra a allergen functions in flavonoid biosynthesis.Mol Plant. 2010; 3: 113-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The first evidence of the involvement of Fra a proteins in the control of the synthesis of flavonoids was provided by Emanuelsson and co-workers (27Hjernø K. Alm R. Canbäck B. Matthiesen R. Trajkovski K. Björk L. Roepstorff P. Emanuelsson C. Down-regulation of the strawberry Bet v 1-homologous allergen in concert with the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway in colorless strawberry mutant.Proteomics. 2006; 6: 1574-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), who reported that fruits of colorless cultivars showed very low levels of Fra a 1 protein expression in contrast to red-colored fruits. Later, Fra a RNAi silencing experiments showed that suppression of the expression of Fra a proteins in strawberry fruits led to decreased accumulation of the main flavonoids responsible for the red color of fruits, including cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside (see Fig. 1), whereas other aspects of fruit maturation were unaffected (28Muñoz C. Hoffmann T. Escobar N.M. Ludemann F. Botella M.A. Valpuesta V. Schwab W. The strawberry fruit Fra a allergen functions in flavonoid biosynthesis.Mol Plant. 2010; 3: 113-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Other flavonoids such as kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and pelargonidin 3-malonyl-glucoside also showed decreased levels in silenced fruits, whereas other intermediate metabolites of the flavonoid pathway such as catechin and proanthocyanidins accumulated at higher levels (see Fig. 1). Interestingly, silencing of Fra a proteins in strawberry also produced a decrease in the expression levels of genes encoding for PAL and chalcone synthase in the fruits, showing that Fra a proteins are required for the expression of structural genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and suggesting that their function may be regulatory (28Muñoz C. Hoffmann T. Escobar N.M. Ludemann F. Botella M.A. Valpuesta V. Schwab W. The strawberry fruit Fra a allergen functions in flavonoid biosynthesis.Mol Plant. 2010; 3: 113-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that the Fra a proteins participate in the control of flavonoid biosynthesis in strawberry fruits. Recently, a solution structure of the Fra a1 protein has been described (46Seutter von Loetzen C. Schweimer K. Schwab W. Rösch P. Hartl-Spiegelhauer O. Solution structure of the strawberry allergen Fra a 1.Biosci. Rep. 2012; 32: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for the function of the Fra proteins remains unknown. In this work, we show that strawberry Fra a proteins bind natural flavonoids, providing a basis for their function in the control of flavonoid metabolisms. Moreover, we present crystallographic structures of Fra a 1E and Fra a 3 in complex with catechin. The analysis of these structures shows that flavonoid binding is associated with conformational changes in critical loop regions providing for the first time a molecular basis for the function of Fra a proteins in the control of flavonoid biosynthesis. Isolation of Fra a 1E, Fra a 2, and Fra a 3 cDNAs ORFs from strawberry has been described previously (28Muñoz C. Hoffmann T. Escobar N.M. Ludemann F. Botella M.A. Valpuesta V. Schwab W. The strawberry fruit Fra a allergen functions in flavonoid biosynthesis.Mol Plant. 2010; 3: 113-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fra a 1E, Fra a 2, and Fra a 3 ORFs were PCR-amplified and cloned into pETM11 (47Dümmler A. Lawrence A.M. de Marco A. Simplified screening for the detection of soluble fusion constructs expressed in E. coli using a modular set of vectors.Microb. Cell Fact. 2005; 4: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) to produce expression constructs F1-pETM11, F2-pETM11, and F3-pETM11, respectively. These constructs include an N-terminal His6 tag followed by the TEV cleavage sequence. After TEV cleavage, only three amino acids (Ala-Met-Ala) remain at the N-terminal end of the proteins. Purification of Fra a proteins was carried out as described by Casañal et al. (48Casañal A. Zander U. Dupeux F. Valpuesta V. Marquez J.A. Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the strawberry allergens Fra a 1E and Fra a 3 in the presence of catechin.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2013; 69: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with either of the Fra a constructs and grown in 2 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin to an OD at 600 nm of 0.6–0.8. At this point, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the cells were harvested after overnight induction at 20 °C and stored at −80 °C before purification. The cells were resuspended in 180 ml of lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease mixture inhibitor) and lysed with a microfluidizer (Microfluidics). A cleared lysate was obtained after centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 45 min. The protein extract was incubated in 25 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose and washed with 125 ml of lysis buffer. The bound protein was eluted with a buffer containing 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The His6 tag of the purified proteins was removed by digestion with the His6-tagged version of the TEV protease. The cleaved samples were incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid to remove the undigested proteins the TEV protease and other contaminants. The correct size of the recombinant proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE. Purified Fra a proteins were extensively dialyzed against sample buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), concentrated to 60 mg/ml, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80 °C. ITC experiments were performed using an ITC200 micro-calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.). Prior to the experiments protein solutions were dialyzed against sample buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Ligands were dissolved in the dialysis buffer, and the pH was carefully adjusted to pH 7.5. All solutions were filtered and degassed. ITC measurements were performed with the three Fra a isoforms and the following flavonoid compounds: (+)-catechin, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, myricetin, and pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside. A number of other phenolic compounds were tested with individual Fra a isoforms according to their specific spatial and developmental expression profiles during fruit ripening (28Muñoz C. Hoffmann T.

This included quercetin-sophoroside with Fra a 1E, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and naringenin with Fra a 2 and procyanidin-B2 and quercetin-3-O-glucoside with Fra a 1E and Fra a 3, respectively. Early precursors of the phenylpropanoid pathway (l-phenylalanine, coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, and caffeic acid) were tested with Fra a 2. Thermograms were recorded at 25 °C and typically involved 26 injections of 1.5 μl, with 3-s intervals between injections with flavonoid compounds as injectants and proteins loaded in the calorimeter cell. Initial protein concentrations varied from 20 to 100 μm, whereas injectant concentrations were between 0.4 and 3 mm. Higher injectant concentrations were not possible due to limited solubility of the ligands in aqueous solutions. The heat associated with the binding process was calculated as the difference between the heat of reaction and the corresponding heat of dilution, as obtained from independent titrations of the ligand into buffer. The resulting binding isotherms were analyzed and fitted through non-linear least-squares to an appropriate thermodynamic model with the MicroCal Origin software (MicroCal, Inc.).

Thus, it is imperative to investigate mechanisms by which influenza virus manipulates the function of host factors and cellular signal pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that influenza virus increases the expression and activation of sphingosine kinase (SK) 1, which in turn regulates diverse cellular signaling pathways. Inhibition of SK suppressed virus-induced NF-κB activation and markedly reduced the synthesis of viral RNAs and proteins. Further, SK blockade interfered with activation of Ran-binding protein 3 (RanBP3), a cofactor of chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1), to inhibit CRM1-mediated nuclear export of the influenza viral ribonucleoprotein complex. In support of this observation, SK inhibition altered the phosphorylation of ERK, p90RSK, and AKT, which is the upstream signal of RanBP3/CRM1 activation. Collectively, these results indicate that SK is a key pro-viral factor regulating multiple cellular signal pathways triggered by influenza virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W1986115996,"The PI3K/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is often aberrantly activated in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and represents a promising therapeutic target. Recent evaluation of AZD8055, an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, by the Preclinical Pediatric Testing Program showed in vivo antitumor activity against childhood solid tumors, including RMS. Therefore, in the present study, we searched for AZD8055-based combination therapies. Here, we identify a new synergistic lethality of AZD8055 together with ABT-737, a BH3 mimetic that antagonizes Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w but not Mcl-1. AZD8055 and ABT-737 cooperate to induce apoptosis in alveolar and embryonal RMS cells in a highly synergistic fashion (combination index < 0.2). Synergistic induction of apoptosis by AZD8055 and ABT-737 is confirmed on the molecular level, as AZD8055 and ABT-737 cooperate to trigger loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspases, and caspase-dependent apoptosis that is blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Similar to AZD8055, the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, the PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120 and Akt inhibitor synergize with ABT-737 to trigger apoptosis, whereas no cooperativity is found for the mTOR complex 1 inhibitor RAD001. Interestingly, molecular studies reveal a correlation between the ability of different PI3K/mTOR inhibitors to potentiate ABT-737-induced apoptosis and to suppress Mcl-1 protein levels. Importantly, knockdown of Mcl-1 increases ABT-737-induced apoptosis similar to AZD8055/ABT-737 cotreatment. This indicates that AZD8055-mediated suppression of Mcl-1 protein plays an important role in the synergistic drug interaction. By identifying a novel synergistic interaction of AZD8055 and ABT-737, our findings have important implications for the development of molecular targeted therapies for RMS."

Several plant-based natural products/dietary supplements, including extracts from Emblica officinalis (Amla), have demonstrated potent anti-neoplastic properties. In this study we determined that Amla extract (AE) has anti-proliferative effects on OC cells under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. We also determined the anti-proliferative effects one of the components of AE, quercetin, on OC cells under in vitro conditions. AE did not induce apoptotic cell death, but did significantly increase the expression of the autophagic proteins beclin1 and LC3B-II under in vitro conditions. Quercetin also increased the expression of the autophagic proteins beclin1 and LC3B-II under in vitro conditions. AE also significantly reduced the expression of several angiogenic genes, including hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) in OVCAR3 cells. AE acted synergistically with cisplatin to reduce cell proliferation and increase expression of the autophagic proteins beclin1 and LC3B-II under in vitro conditions. AE also had anti-proliferative effects and induced the expression of the autophagic proteins beclin1 and LC3B-II in mouse xenograft tumors. Additionally, AE reduced endothelial cell antigen – CD31 positive blood vessels and HIF-1α expression in mouse xenograft tumors. Together, these studies indicate that AE inhibits OC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo possibly via inhibition of angiogenesis and activation of autophagy in OC. Thus AE may prove useful as an alternative or adjunct therapeutic approach in helping to fight OC."

Predictors of cognitive impairment at year 5 were identified using multivariate analysis.Of 331 patients who completed the 3-year COGIMUS study, 265 participated in the 2-year extension study, 201 of whom (75.8%; sc IFN β-1a three times weekly: 44 µg, n = 108; 22 µg, n = 93) completed 5 years' follow-up. The proportion of patients with cognitive impairment in the study population overall remained stable between baseline (18.0%) and year 5 (22.6%). The proportion of patients with cognitive impairment also remained stable in both treatment groups between baseline and year 5, and between year 3 and year 5. However, a significantly higher proportion of men than women had cognitive impairment at year 5 (26.5% vs 14.4%, p = 0.046). Treatment with the 22 versus 44 µg dose was predictive of cognitive impairment at year 5 (hazard ratio 0.68; 95% confidence interval 0.48-0.97).This study suggests that sc IFN β-1a dose-dependently stabilizes or delays cognitive impairment over a 5-year period in most patients with mild RRMS. Women seem to be more protected against developing cognitive impairment, which may indicate greater response to therapy or the inherently better prognosis associated with female sex in MS."

Prenylation is the covalent attachment of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) to a cysteine residue of proteins harboring a carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif (where C is cysteine, AA are usually aliphatic amino acids, and X is a variable). The isoprenoids FPP and GGPP are cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates, and their levels in cells can be reduced by statin therapy. Prenylation of CAAX proteins is catalyzed by protein farnesyltransferase (FT) and protein geranylgeranyltransferase-1 (GGT), and sequences within the CAAX motif determine whether a protein is farnesylated or geranylgeranylated.

These findings indicate that protein prenylation may play an important role in the development of AD. However, some important issues remain to be addressed. First, little is known about the relative importance of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation in the development of AD. Second, the majority of previous studies was conducted in vitro. Appropriate animal models had not been available to study the role of protein prenylation in AD. It is not known whether findings from in vitro studies can be replicated in animal models. To define the role of the two protein prenylation pathways in the pathogenesis of AD in vivo, we used a genetic approach to directly manipulate the levels of FT and GGT activities in the APPPS1 mouse model of AD. Our results demonstrate for the first time that haplodeficiency in farnesyltransferase but not geranylgeranyltransferase rescues cognitive function as well as attenuates Aβ-associated neuropathology in APPPS1 mice. APPPS1 double transgenic mice (B6C3-Tg (APPswe, PSEN1dE9) 85Dbo/J; stock number 004462) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). FT or GGT β subunits heterozygous deletion (+/−) mice were generated as described previously (31Liu M. Sjogren A.K. Karlsson C. Ibrahim M.X. Andersson K.M. Olofsson F.J. Wahlstrom A.M. Dalin M. Yu H.

All transgenes are in the heterozygous state; therefore, breeding of APPPS1 mice with either FT+/− or GGT+/− mice produced four genotypes of mice, respectively, APPPS1/FT+/−, APPPS1, FT+/−, and wild-type (WT) mice or APPPS1/GGT+/−, APPPS1, GGT+/−, and WT mice. Genotypes of the mice were determined by PCR analysis of genomic DNA from tail biopsies with gene-specific primers. All animal procedures used for this study were prospectively reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Minnesota. The mice were deeply anesthetized, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture with heparin as an anticoagulant. Following perfusion via the heart with ice-cold PBS, brains were cut sagittally into left and right hemispheres. The left hemisphere was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histological analysis. The right hemisphere (devoid of cerebellum and brain stem) was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for biochemical analysis. Brain homogenates were prepared as we described previously (32Cao D. Lu H. Lewis T.L. Li L.

Commercial ELISA kits (Invitrogen) were used to measure Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in carbonate-soluble and -insoluble (guanidine-soluble) fractions according to the manufacturer's protocol. For immunoblot analysis, aliquots of brain homogenate were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with specific primary antibodies against the following: human Aβ (6E10, Signet, Dedham, MA); the carboxyl terminus of APP (CT695, Invitrogen); the soluble amino-terminal fragments of APP (sAPPα and sAPPβ) (2B3 (11088B) and 6A1 (10321B), Clontech), GGT-1β (sc-18996), and FT-β (sc-137) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX); mouse apolipoprotein E (apoE) (sc-6384, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) (kindly provided by Dr. Guojun Bu, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL); insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) (PC730, EMD Biosciences/Millipore, Billerica, MA); neprilysin (sc-9149, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); IBA-1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1) (Wako, Richmond, VA), and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) (Millipore) followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Signal was detected by the ECL Plus Western Blotting System (GE Healthcare) and quantified by the ImageJ software. For a loading control when appropriate, the blots were stripped and reprobed with mouse anti-actin or anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or goat anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) polyclonal antibody (sc-20357, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Briefly, fixed brain tissues were sectioned at 50 μm using a Vibratome (Leica Microsystems Inc). Tissue sections were stored at 4 °C in PBS with 0.01% sodium azide and subjected to free-floating immunostaining using the ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to detect Aβ, activated microglia, and astrocytes. The primary antibody 6E10 (Signet) was used for assessing Aβ deposition, IBA-1 antibody (Wako) for assessing activated microglia, and GFAP antibody (Millipore) for assessing activated astrocytes. Immunoreactivity of Aβ, GFAP, and IBA-1 in the cortex and hippocampus of mouse brain was quantified using a histomorphometry system (Image-Pro Plus, MediaCybernetics, Rockville, MD). For double immunofluorescence analyses, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a mixture of IBA-1 or GFAP antibody (rabbit) with 6E10 antibody (mouse). After the incubation, a combination of secondary antibodies, Alexa 488-tagged donkey anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 594-tagged donkey anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR), were applied for 60 min at room temperature. The sections were examined with an Olympus FluoView FV1000 BX2 upright confocal microscopic system. Three AD-related behavioral functions (spatial learning and memory, exploration of environmental stimuli, and anxiety) were assessed. The testing schedule included exploration of the T-maze (days 1–5), the open field (days 1–3), the elevated plus-maze test for anxiety levels (days 4 and 5), and spatial learning in the Morris water maze (days 6–11). All equipment and software were purchased from SD Instruments (San Diego). All testing procedures have been described in detail previously (26Li L. Cao D. Kim H. Lester R. Fukuchi K.

The room contained abundant extra-maze visual cues for orientation. The acquisition of the spatial task consists of placing the mice next to and facing the wall successively in north, east, south, and west positions, with the escape platform hidden 1 cm below the water level in the middle of the northeast quadrant. In each trial, the mouse was allowed to swim until it finds the hidden platform or until 60 s had elapsed, at which point the mouse was guided to the platform, where it remained for 10 s before being returned to a cage containing paper towels to dry. The escape latency and swim path length were recorded by the ANYMAZE System (San Diego Instruments, San Diego) for four trials daily for 5 days. The day after the acquisition phase, a probe trial was conducted by removing the platform and placing the mouse next to and facing the north side. The time spent in the previously correct (target) quadrant was measured in a single 60-s trial. Two hours later, the visible platform version of the test was performed with the escape platform lifted 1 cm above water level and shifted to the southeast quadrant. A spire was added to the top of the escape platform as a viewing aid. This was used to evaluate the visual acuity of the mice. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Comparison of different genotype groups was performed by Student's t test and repeated measures of analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Breeding of APPPS1 mice with FT+/− or GGT+/− mice produced mice that carry the APPPS1 double transgenes and heterozygous deletion of the FT or GGT β subunit. To verify the haplodeficiency of FT and GGT in the brain, we assessed protein levels of FT and GGT in lysates of the cortex. As expected, Western blot analysis indicated that the protein level of FT and GGT was decreased by ∼50% in APPPS1/FT+/− and APPPS1/GGT+/− mice, respectively, compared with that in APPPS1 mice (Fig. 1). To define the impact of FT and GGT haplodeficiency on cerebral β-amyloidogenesis in APPPS1 mice, we quantified the levels of Aβ in the carbonate-soluble and -insoluble (guanidine-soluble) fractions in brain lysates by ELISA. In the carbonate-soluble fraction, there was no difference in Aβ42 levels between the different groups, but the level of soluble Aβ40 was decreased in APPPS1/GGT+/− mice (Fig. 2A). In the guanidine-soluble fraction, the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were reduced in both APPPS1/FT+/− and APPPS1/GGT+/− mice, compared with APPPS1 mice (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these findings, Aβ deposition in the hippocampal area was lower in APPPS1/FT+/− and APPPS1/GGT+/− mice than in APPPS1 mice (Fig. 3, A and B). However, the reduction was more pronounced in APPPS1/FT+/− mice than in APPPS1/GGT+/− mice (Fig. 3B). Aβ deposition in the cortex area was reduced in APPPS1/FT+/− compared with APPPS1 mice, but there was only a trend for a decrease in APPPS1/GGT+/− mice (Fig. 3, C and D).FIGURE 3Aβ deposition is reduced to different degrees in the hippocampal and cortical areas of FT- and GGT-haplodeficient mice. A and C, representative brain sections of hippocampal (A) and cortical (C) areas from 6- and 9-month-old mice immunostained with anti-Aβ antibody (6E10). B and D, relative Aβ load in the hippocampal (B) and cortical (D) areas determined by immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses with the levels in the age- and sex-matched APPPS1 control group set as 100%. In the hippocampal area, Aβ deposition is reduced in both APPPS1/FT+/− and APPPS1/GGT+/− mice. In the cortical area, the Aβ deposition is reduced significantly in APPPS1/FT+/− mice but not in APPPS1/GGT+/− mice. n = 7–10 mice/genotype; age = 6–9 months; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01. Scale bars, 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether the decrease of Aβ levels in the brain of APPPS1/FT+/− and APPPS1/GGT+/− mice was caused by a decrease in the generation of Aβ from APP, we determined the steady-state levels of full-length APP, and carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTF) and soluble amino-terminal fragments (sAPP) of APP produced by α- and β-secretase cleavages by immunoblot analyses. There were no differences in the amount of full-length APP, but the ratios of β-CTF to α-CTF and sAPPβ to sAPPα in APPPS1/FT+/− mice were reduced (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting a shift to nonamyloidogenic processing of APP by FT haplodeficiency. Next, we examined factors that are involved in Aβ clearance and degradation. ApoE and LRP1 are major proteins involved in the clearance of Aβ in the brain (35Holtzman D.M. Herz J. Bu G. Apolipoprotein E and apolipoprotein E receptors: normal biology and roles in Alzheimer disease.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2: a006312Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis indicated that the steady-state levels of apoE and LRP1 were unchanged. IDE, originally recognized for its ability to degrade insulin, can also degrade Aβ (36Selkoe D.J. Clearing the brain's amyloid cobwebs.Neuron. 2001; 32: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2005296233,"CXXC5 is a member of a small subset of proteins containing CXXC-type zinc-finger domain. Here, we show that CXXC5 is a transcription factor activating Flk-1, a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor. CXXC5 and Flk-1 were accmulated in nucli and membrane of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), respectively, during their endothelial differentiation. CXXC5 overexpression induced Flk-1 transcription in both endothelium-differentiated mESCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In vitro DNA binding assay showed direct interaction of CXXC5 on the Flk-1 promoter region, and mutation on its DNA-binding motif abolished transcriptional activity. We showed that bone morphorgeneic protein 4 (BMP4) induced CXXC5 transcription in the cells, and inhibitors of BMP signaling suppressed the CXXC5 induction and the consequent Flk-1 induction by BMP4 treatment. CXXC5 knockdown resulted in suppression of BMP4-induced stress fiber formation (56.8±1.3% decrease, P<0.05) and migration (54.6±1.9% decrease, P<0.05) in HUVECs. The in vivo roles of CXXC5 in BMP-signaling-specific vascular development and angiogenesis were shown by specific defect of caudal vein plex vessel formation (57.9±11.8% decrease, P<0.05) in cxxc5 morpholino-injected zebrafish embryos and by supression of BMP4-induced angigogensis in subcutaneously injected Matrigel plugs in CXXC5-/- mice. Overall, CXXC5 is a transcriptional activator for Flk-1, mediating BMP signaling for differentiation and migration of endothelial cell and vessel formation.—Kim, H.-Y., Yang, D.-H., Shin, S.-W., Kim, M.-Y., Yoon, J.-H., Kim, S., Park, H.-C., Kang, D.

The human GLRX2 gene gives rise to three transcript variants encoding the mitochondrial Grx2a and the cytosolic Grx2b and Grx2c.

The zebrafish genome contains a single gene (glrx2) that encodes the equivalent to human and mouse Grx2c. Recently, we demonstrated that embryonic brain development depends on the enzymatic activity of this cytosolic Grx2 (11Bräutigam L. Schütte L.D. Godoy J.R. Prozorovski T. Gellert M. Hauptmann G. Holmgren A. Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Vertebrate-specific glutaredoxin is essential for brain development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 20532-20537Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Zebrafish with morpholino-silenced expression of the cytosolic Grx2 lost virtually all types of neurons by apoptotic cell death and the ability to develop an axonal scaffold. As early as 18 h post fertilization, the axon scaffold was severely reduced. At 24 h post fertilization, essentially all embryos depleted of cytosolic Grx2 lost HuC-positive (an early neuronal marker) cells in the central nervous system. These severe defects could be rescued by co-injection of morpholino-resistant glrx2 mRNA but not by co-injection of mRNA encoding redox-inactive mutants. Notably, even a mutant that was still capable of catalyzing the Grx-specific monothiol reaction mechanism, which is sufficient for the catalysis of protein de/glutathionylation, did not rescue the phenotype to any degree. In a cellular model of neuronal differentiation, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells overexpressing Grx2c during differentiation displayed 1.5- to 2-fold longer axons with almost twice as many branching points. Thus, Grx2c is essential for neuronal differentiation through the control of axonal outgrowth in a process that requires the dithiol reaction mechanism, implying the reduction of at least one specific protein disulfide (11Bräutigam L. Schütte L.D. Godoy J.R. Prozorovski T. Gellert M. Hauptmann G. Holmgren A. Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Vertebrate-specific glutaredoxin is essential for brain development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 20532-20537Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To uncover the mechanism through which Grx2c acts in axon guidance, we deployed a proteomic approach: enzymatic intermediate trapping. This strategy allowed us to identify proteins that can undergo dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions catalyzed by Grx2 in a dithiol reaction mechanism (12Schütte L.D. Baumeister S. Weis B. Hudemann C.

Acta. 2013; 1830: 4999-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Among the potential targets, the association of Grx2c with the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2/DPYSL2/ULIP2), could be confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. CRMP2 is a part of the semaphorin-3A-plexin signaling cascade whose critical functions in axon guidance are well documented (13Arimura N. Menager C. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K.

Altogether, these results strongly suggest the regulation of CRMP2 through a specific protein dithiol-disulfide switch. Here, we aimed at the identification of this dithiol-disulfide switch, how it controls the function of CRMP2, and whether it could play a role during neuronal differentiation. Chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated and were of analytical grade or better. The antibodies used in this work were as follows: CRMP2 (Sigma-Aldrich, C2993), CRMP2 P-T514 (Cell Signaling Technologies, catalog no. 9397), neurofilament m (Cell Signaling Technologies, catalog no. 2838), glial fibrillary acidic protein (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA; PA3-16727), and GAPDH (Sigma-Aldrich, G9545). Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent from Bio-Rad. SDS-PAGE and Western blots were run using precasted Precise gels (4–20% (w/v), Thermo Scientific) or mini-Protean TGX Stain-free gels (4–20% (w/v), Bio-Rad), and PVDF membranes (Macherey & Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs were obtained from Bio-Rad. Blue native electrophoresis was performed using precasted NativeBlueNovex gels and buffers as suggested by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). Western blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence staining and documented using a Chemidoc XRS+ documentation system (Bio-Rad).

RNA isolation was performed according to the manual provided for the NucleoSpin® RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). RNA concentration was measured photometrically using the NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). First strand cDNA was prepared using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA synthesis kit according to the protocol provided using 1 μg of RNA as template and oligo dT18 primer (Thermo Scientific). 1 μl of the cDNA was used as template for quantitative PCR. The SensiMix SYBR HI-ROX contained SYBR Green I dye, dNTPs, stabilizers, and a hot start DNA polymerase was provided as 2× Master Mix (Bioline, London, UK). The primer concentration used for the quantitative PCR was 0.5 μm each (5′-GGAGAGAGATGTCTTATCAGG and 3′-CTGCATAGAACGACTGGTCATC), and the volume was adjusted to 20 μl with double distilled H2O. All quantitative PCRs were performed using the CFX96 Real Time System from Bio-Rad. For optimization, a gradient quantitative PCR from 55 to 65 °C was performed, and samples were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. At 60 °C annealing temperature, the reaction resulted in a specific product at the expected size. GAPDH was used as a reference (primer pair: 5′-CAAGGTCATCCATGACAACTTTG and 3′-GTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG) in the ΔΔCq mode. For recombinant protein expression, E. coli cells were propagated in a 5 liters of Bioreactor (R'ALF; Bioengineering, Wald, Switzerland). The LB medium (5 liters), containing the selective antibiotics, was inoculated at 37 °C with 1% (v/v) of an overnight culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon-plus (Life technologies) harboring the pET15b-CRMP2 or pET24a-CRMP2. At OD 0.6, expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and by lowering the temperature to 14 °C. The cells were harvested after 16–20 h by centrifugation. Bacteria were lysed by incubation with 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.05 mg/ml Dnase I for 20 min at room temperature and subsequent ultrasonic treatment for 3 min, 80% intensity, 0.5s cycle time (50% cycling) using a UP200S ultrasonic processor (Hielscher; Teltow, Germany). Recombinant His-tagged CRMP2 proteins were purified by the immobilized metal affinity chromatography technique using an Äkta FPLC System as suggested by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column and an Äkta System (both GE healthcare) equilibrated with PBS. 85 μm purified CRMP2 were reduced with 5 mm DTT, 5 mm pH-neutralized Tris(2-chlorethyl)phosphate (TCEP), and 0.8 μm human Grx2c and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. To remove all reductants, the protein solution was re-buffered using either NAP-5 or PD10 Sephadex G25 prepacked columns (GE Healthcare). After desalting, 16 nmol of the reduced protein in 200–500 μl were loaded on the column and separated at a flow rate of 1 ml/minute. The remaining protein was oxidized by 200 μm H2O2 for 30 min at room temperature. H2O2 was removed by rebuffering as described previously, and 16 nmol of oxidized protein were loaded on the column and separated. The remaining protein was rereduced as before and also separated by gel filtration. The Superdex 200 column was equilibrated with PBS between the runs. Fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. A calibration curve for apparent molecular masses was produced using the manufacturer's calibration standards. Recombinant CRMP2 (85 μm) was reduced with 5 mm DTT and 5 mm pH-neutralized TCEP or oxidized with 200 μm H2O2 for 30 min at room temperature each. Subsequently, the proteins were denatured, and all thiols were blocked by specific alkylation with 10 mm NEM. A standard SDS-PAGE was performed with the samples considered for mass spectrometry, and the gel was stained with Coomassie staining solution (Thermo Scientific). Excised gel fragments were destained in 100 mm NH4HCO3 in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. Following drying, proteins were digested in 20 μl trypsin (10 ng/μl in 10 mm NH4HCO3 solution) at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were collected in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid. Next, samples were mixed with 0.7 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix in 50% acetonitrile/0.5% TFA on the target and measured by MS using a 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF analyzer (Thermo Scientific). Spectra were aligned manually with data of an in silico analysis of the theoretical amino acid sequence, with and without modifications, to confirm the presence of the peptides of interest. Peptide mass fingerprint peak lists were compared with the SwissProt database rel. 57, restricted to human taxonomy, using the Mascot search engine (version 1.9, Matrix Science Ltd, London, UK). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded in a Jasco instrument. Freshly purified CRMP2 (80 μm) was reduced with 5 mm DTT, 5 mm pH-neutralized TCEP, and 0.8 μm human Grx2c for 30 min at room temperature. To remove all reductants, the protein solution was rebuffered using NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare). Next, the protein was oxidized by 200 μm H2O2 for 30 min at room temperature. H2O2 was removed by rebuffering in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, containing 20 mm MgCl2 as described previously. The oxidized sample (6 μm) was analyzed in a 1-mm cuvette, scanning 0.2-nm steps, averaging 10 iterations. Subsequently, the protein was reduced by addition of 1 mm DTT, 1 mm TCEP, and 0.06 μm Grx2c, incubated for 30 min, and analyzed again. All spectra were corrected by subtraction of the associated baselines. The thermal stability of reduced and oxidized CRMP2 was assayed using the thermofluor assay as outlined in Ref. 22Ericsson U.B. Hallberg B.M. Detitta G.T. Dekker N. Nordlund P. Thermofluor-based high-throughput stability optimization of proteins for structural studies.Anal. Biochem. 2006; 357: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar. In brief, 10 μm protein, reduced and oxidized as outlined above and rebuffered in PBS containing 20 mm MgCl2, were mixed with SYPRO Orange (1:100 diluted, Sigma-Aldrich) and heated in a CFX96 Real Time System from Bio-Rad in 0.5 K increments from 20 to 95 °C in 1 h. The increase in fluorescence due to binding of the dye to hydrophobic regions exposed during denaturation was recorded using the FRET settings of the instrument. The curves presented represent the average of five experiments. All media, FCS, antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin), trypsin, and PBS were purchased from PAA (Cölbe, Germany), disposable plastics from Sarstedt (Nümbrecht, Germany). SH-SY5Y cells were propagated in MEM, low glucose, supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), 10% (v/v) FCS, and 2 mm l-glutamine. For differentiation into a neuron-like phenotype, cells were treated with 10 μm retinoic acid (solved in dimethyl sulfoxide) up to 7 days (23Påhlman S. Ruusala A.I. Abrahamsson L. Mattsson M.E. Esscher T. Retinoic acid-induced differentiation of cultured human neuroblastoma cells: a comparison with phorbolester-induced differentiation.Cell Differ. 1984; 14: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide served as control. At 6, 24, 48, 72, 120, and 168 h, cells were detached by trypsin treatment, washed with PBS, and lysed by adding 40 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 1-fold protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1-fold phosphatase inhibitor mixture 3 (Sigma) at pH 7.4 and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (21,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Cells were seeded on fibronectin-covered glass slides, cultivated as indicated, washed with PBS, fixated with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min, washed with PBS, permeabilized for 30 min at room temperature in 0.4% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS for another 30 min. The primary antibody (CRMP2, 1:1000) was incubated overnight at 4 °C, the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488; Life Technologies, 1:400) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with 1 μg/ml DAPI. Slides were mounted with Mowiol (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) and analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS SP5 instrument with a 63-fold/1.4 oil lens. Two isoforms of human CRMP2 have been described, the canonical isoform CRMP2B and CRMP2A with an alternative N-terminal section. Here, we always refer to CRMP2B when addressing CRMP2. Human CRMP2 consists of 572 amino acid residues, it contains eight cysteinyl residues, from which six are conserved from zebrafish to man (see supplemental Fig. 1). The cDNA of human CRMP2 was cloned by PCR from a commercial cDNA library and ligated into the expression vectors pET15b and pET24a for expression as N- and C-terminal His6 fusion protein, respectively. Expression was optimized in a 5-liter bioreactor; propagation was performed at 14 °C for ∼18 h following the induction of expression at an OD of 0.6 typically yielded 5 (pET24a) to 15 mg (pET15b) soluble protein per liter of culture without the appearance of insoluble portions. We could not observe any significant differences between the behavior of the N- and C-terminally tagged proteins in initial gel filtration chromatography and blue native electrophoresis (see below). We have thus chosen the N-terminally tagged protein for in-depth analysis because of the higher yield in expression. CRMP2 was reported to form homotetramers (24Wang L.H. Strittmatter S.M. Brain CRMP forms heterotetramers similar to liver dihydropyrimidinase.J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2261-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We first hypothesized that redox regulation, i.e. oxidation and reduction of CRMP2, could alter this quaternary structure. Freshly purified CRMP2 was reduced by DTT, TCEP, and a catalytic amount of purified human Grx2c (1/100th molar ratio). CRMP2 was efficiently reduced by DTT and TCEP alone; however, the addition of Grx2c significantly increased the velocity of this reaction when followed by CD spectroscopy (see below). Reducing agents were quickly removed by size exclusion chromatography (Sephadex G25), and the quaternary structures of the reduced and oxidized proteins were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200, Fig. 1A). In parallel, the reduced and rebuffered protein was oxidized by H2O2 (5-fold molecular excess) and subsequently analyzed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1A). To confirm the reversibility, oxidized CRMP2 was also rebuffered, rereduced as done previously and analyzed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1A). As depicted in Fig. 1 and Table 1, reduced, oxidized, and re-reduced CRMP2 fractions with the proteins in their native, folded states were primarily detected in the homotetrameric form, despite a minor fraction of dodecameric protein and the transient appearance of a minor fraction of monomeric CRMP2 in the oxidized form. In conclusion, oxidation and reduction did not change the tetrameric structure of CRMP2 when present in the native state. When analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B), denatured oxidized CRMP2 migrated in two bands corresponding to dimers, i.e. two disulfide-linked monomers and monomeric proteins at a ratio of 1:2. Denatured reduced CRMP2 migrated in a single band at the expected size of monomeric CRMP2. In conclusion, oxidation of CRMP2 did not change the tetrameric quaternary structure of the folded protein, but it led to the formation of up to one intermolecular disulfide in the tetrameric complex.TABLE 1Apparent molecular weight and quaternary structure of reduced, oxidized, and re-reduced CRMP2 determined by gel filtration chromatography (see Fig. 1) (n = 3)FractionMW± S.D.SubunitsMW/subunitkDakDa1812.94.81267.72256.33.3464.1366.03.5166.0439.92.1CRMP264.2 Open table in a new tab To confirm that the reduction of the CRMP2 disulfide by Grx2c is catalyzed in a dithiol reaction mechanism, i.e. that it requires both thiols in the CXXC active site of Grx2c, oxidized CRMP2 was incubated with reduced wild-type and the CXXS active site mutant (C40S) Grx2c and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As predicted for the dithiol reaction mechanism, CRMP2 did not form a complex with wild-type Grx2c, but with the mutant lacking the resolving cysteinyl residue (Fig. 2, see arrowhead). Thus, Grx2c reduces CRMP2 by attack of the N-terminal cysteinyl active site thiol on the CRMP2 disulfide; this intermediate mixed disulfide is immediately reduced by the second active site thiol. Noteworthy, also wild-type Trx1 was able to reduce the CRMP2 disulfide in vitro and did not form a stable complex with CRMP2. First information for a switch between two distinct conformations of the CRMP2 tetramer in consequence of oxidation and reduction came from the analysis of zebrafish CRMP2 by CD spectroscopy (11Bräutigam L. Schütte L.D. Godoy J.R. Prozorovski T. Gellert M. Hauptmann G. Holmgren A. Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Vertebrate-specific glutaredoxin is essential for brain development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 20532-20537Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For human CRMP2, we recorded a reversible decrease in ellipticity upon reduction of CRMP2 at 210–220 nm (Fig. 3A), indicative for a reversible decrease in α-helical content of the reduced protein. To confirm and further characterize this switch in conformations, we analyzed the changes induced by reduction and oxidation of tetrameric CRMP2 (in parallel to gel filtration chromatography, see above) in blue native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3B). The mobility of proteins in blue native electrophoresis is determined by the binding of the Coomassie dye to hydrophobic regions of the protein. As shown in Fig. 3, reduced CRMP2 migrates significantly faster in blue native electrophoresis, indicating conformational changes in the reduced tetramer that lead to the exposition of hydrophobic regions. We also tested the influence of the redox switch on the thermal stability of the protein applying differential scanning fluorimetry (Fig. 3C) but did not record significant differences between the two species (Tm, 56 versus 57 °C). To identify the cysteinyl residues forming the dithiol-disulfide switch, we labeled the thiol groups of oxidized and reduced CRMP2 with NEM to prevent further redox modifications. Tryptic fragments were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Among the peptides containing some of the eight cysteinyl residues, we identified only one difference between the reduced and oxidized protein (see also supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Reduced and NEM-labeled CRMP2 contained two peptides corresponding to the masses of a fragment in which Cys-504 was labeled with NEM or NEM/H2O (Fig. 4, A.1, I and II), which are absent from oxidized CRMP2 (Fig. 4, A.2). Oxidized CRMP2 contains one peptide (Fig. 4, B.2, III) corresponding to the mass of two disulfide-linked Cys-504-containing peptides that was not present in the reduced protein (Fig. 4, B.1). Interestingly, we were not able to induce glutathionylation of the protein by treatment with excess GSSG (data not shown). Thus, oxidation specifically induced intermolecular disulfides between the Cys-504 residues of two CRMP2 molecules in the homotetrameric complex. To confirm the relevance of the redox-induced conformational switch in vivo, we have analyzed CRMP2 in a cellular model of neuronal differentiati"

Here a robust set of CRC markers is selected by an ensemble method. By using a dataset of 232 gene expression profiles, gSFA discovers 16 highly significant small gene signatures. Analysis of dichotomies generated by the signatures results in a set of 133 samples stably classified in good prognosis group and 56 samples in poor prognosis group, whereas 43 remain unreliably classified. AKAP12, DCBLD2, NT5E and SPON1 are particularly represented in the signatures and selected for validation in vivo on two independent patients cohorts comprising 140 tumor tissues and 60 matched normal tissues. Their expression and regulatory programs are investigated in vitro. We show that the coupled expression of NT5E and DCBLD2 robustly stratifies our patients in two groups (one of which with 100% survival at five years). We show that NT5E is a target of the TNF-α signaling in vitro; the tumor suppressor PPARγ acts as a novel NT5E antagonist that positively and concomitantly regulates DCBLD2 in a cancer cell context-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2065471120,"The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein is the founding member and namesake of the Bcl-2-protein family. It has recently been demonstrated that Bcl-2, apart from its anti-apoptotic role at mitochondrial membranes, can also directly interact with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), the primary Ca2+-release channel in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Bcl-2 can thereby reduce pro-apoptotic IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER. Moreover, the Bcl-2 homology domain 4 (Bcl-2-BH4) has been identified as essential and sufficient for this IP3R-mediated anti-apoptotic activity. In the present study, we investigated whether the reported inhibitory effect of a Bcl-2-BH4 peptide on the IP 3R1 was related to the distinctive α-helical conformation of the BH4 domain peptide. We therefore designed a peptide with two glycine “hinges” replacing residues I14 and V15, of the wild-type Bcl-2-BH4 domain (Bcl-2-BH4-IV/GG). By comparing the structural and functional properties of the Bcl-2-BH4-IV/GG peptide with its native counterpart, we found that the variant contained reduced α-helicity, neither bound nor inhibited the IP 3R1 channel, and in turn lost its anti-apoptotic effect. Similar results were obtained with other substitutions in Bcl-2-BH4 that destabilized the α-helix with concomitant loss of IP3R inhibition. These results provide new insights for the further development of Bcl-2-BH4-derived peptides as specific inhibitors of the IP3R with significant pharmacological implications."

Metabolism of dopamine involves three enzymes: monoamine oxidase, catechol O-methyltransferase, and sulfotransferase. In primates but not lower order animals, a sulfotransferase (SULT1A3) is present that can rapidly metabolize dopamine to dopamine sulfate. Here, we show that SULT1A3 and a closely related protein SULT1A1 are highly inducible by dopamine. This involves activation of the D1 and NMDA receptors. Both ERK1/2 phosphorylation and calcineurin activation are required for induction. Pharmacological agents that inhibited induction or siRNA targeting SULT1A3 significantly increased the susceptibility of cells to dopamine toxicity. Taken together, these results show that dopamine can induce its own metabolism and protect neuron-like cells from damage, suggesting that SULT1A3 activity may be a risk factor for dopamine-dependent neurodegenerative diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2005400746,"Cape vulture Gyps coprotheres populations have declined across their range due to multiple anthropogenic threats. Their susceptibility to fatal collisions with the expanding power line network and the prevalence of carcasses contaminated with illegal poisons and other threats outside protected areas are thought to be the primary drivers of declines in southern Africa. We used GPS-GSM units to track the movements and delineate the home ranges of five adult (mean ±SD minimum convex polygon area = 121,655±90,845 km2) and four immature (mean ±SD minimum convex polygon area = 492,300±259,427 km2) Cape vultures to investigate the influence of power lines and their use of protected areas. The vultures travelled more than 1,000 km from the capture site and collectively entered five different countries in southern Africa. Their movement patterns and core foraging ranges were closely associated with the spatial distribution of transmission power lines and we present evidence that the construction of power lines has allowed the species to extend its range to areas previously devoid of suitable perches. The distribution of locations of known Cape vulture mortalities caused by interactions with power lines corresponded to the core ranges of the tracked vultures. Although some of the vultures regularly roosted at breeding colonies located inside protected areas the majority of foraging activity took place on unprotected farmland. Their ability to travel vast distances very quickly and the high proportion of time they spend in the vicinity of power lines and outside protected areas make Cape vultures especially vulnerable to negative interactions with the expanding power line network and the full range of threats across the region. Co-ordinated cross-border conservation strategies beyond the protected area network will therefore be necessary to ensure the future survival of threatened vultures in Africa."

https://openalex.org/W2041786095,"Syntaxin-1A is a t-SNARE that is involved in vesicle docking and vesicle fusion; it is important in presynaptic exocytosis in neurons because it interacts with many regulatory proteins. Previously, we found the following: 1) that autophosphorylated Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), an important modulator of neural plasticity, interacts with syntaxin-1A to regulate exocytosis, and 2) that a syntaxin missense mutation (R151G) attenuated this interaction. To determine more precisely the physiological importance of this interaction between CaMKII and syntaxin, we generated mice with a knock-in (KI) syntaxin-1A (R151G) mutation. Complexin is a molecular clamp involved in exocytosis, and in the KI mice, recruitment of complexin to the SNARE complex was reduced because of an abnormal CaMKII/syntaxin interaction. Nevertheless, SNARE complex formation was not inhibited, and consequently, basal neurotransmission was normal. However, the KI mice did exhibit more enhanced presynaptic plasticity than wild-type littermates; this enhanced plasticity could be associated with synaptic response than did wild-type littermates; this pronounced response included several behavioral abnormalities. Notably, the R151G phenotypes were generally similar to previously reported CaMKII mutant phenotypes. Additionally, synaptic recycling in these KI mice was delayed, and the density of synaptic vesicles was reduced. Taken together, our results indicated that this single point mutation in syntaxin-1A causes abnormal regulation of neuronal plasticity and vesicle recycling and that the affected syntaxin-1A/CaMKII interaction is essential for normal brain and synaptic functions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2011066610,"Early embryos of vertebrates undergo remarkable dynamic molecular events, such as embryonic gradient, cellular polarity, and asymmetry necessary for cell fate decisions. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) is a powerful tool to investigate rare or dynamic molecular events and has been developed for relatively small cells in culture and tissues but is not yet available for large cells of early development stage embryos. Here we report the capability of CLEM in blastomeres of medaka fish by using the mitochondria detection system. A short N-terminal signal peptide of the mitochondrial protein Tom20 was linked to green fluorescent protein (GFP), resulting in a fusion protein termed Tom20:GFP. The subcellular location of Tom20:GFP in medaka blastomeres reveals the lack of mitochondrial distribution in pseudopodia as well as inconspicuous redistribution during divisions. Blastomeres, after sample preparation procedures including high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution, are able to preserve fluorescence, antigenicity, and fine structures, which allows for precise correlation between the Tom20:GFP fluorescence and mitochondria on merged light and electron micrographs. Furthermore, nanogold immunostaining for Tom20:GFP and endogenous Tom20 revealed their specific localization on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Our results extend the CLEM approach to early development stage embryos of a vertebrate.—Yuan, Y., Li, M., Hong, N., Hong, Y.

We investigated the role of ASL transcript variants in the clinical and biochemical variability of ASA. Recombinant proteins for ASL wild type, mutant p.E189G, and the frequently occurring transcript variants with exon 2 or 7 deletions were (co-)expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. We found that exon 2-deleted ASL forms a stable truncated protein with no relevant activity but a dose-dependent dominant negative effect on enzymatic activity after co-expression with wild type or mutant ASL, whereas exon 7-deleted ASL is unstable but seems to have, nevertheless, a dominant negative effect on mutant ASL. These findings were supported by structural modeling predictions for ASL heterotetramer/homotetramer formation. Illustrating the physiological relevance, the predominant occurrence of exon 7-deleted ASL was found in two patients who were both heterozygous for the ASL mutant p.E189G. Our results suggest that ASL transcripts can contribute to the highly variable phenotype in ASA patients if expressed at high levels. Especially, the exon 2-deleted ASL variant may form a heterotetramer with wild type or mutant ASL, causing markedly reduced ASL activity."
