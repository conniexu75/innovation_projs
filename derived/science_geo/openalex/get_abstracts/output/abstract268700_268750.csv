https://openalex.org/W1971566586,"A laboratory experiment shows that ridge-ridge transform faults, inactive fracture zones, and other features characteristic of spreading oceanic ridges can be produced in a variety of paraffins. Although the resultant pattern depends upon the temperature of the wax and the ratio of spreading rate to surface cooling, the characteristic orthogonal ridge transform fault system is a preferred mode of separation. Symmetric spreading occurs under conditions of no tensile strength across the ridge, and the stability of transform faults is a consequence of their lack of shear strength. The experiment also shows that properties characteristic of oceanic ridges occur under conditions of passive convection where upwelling of material at the ridge crest is a result only of hydrostatic forces in the fluid; that is, the plate separation is caused not by large convective forces beneath the ridge but rather by tensile forces in the plate."

I think it is fair to say, however, that FES, UPS, and INS do make it possible for us to determine energy level spectra which can with some confidence be ascribed to the resonances of electrons in surface orbitals. It is true that INS is the more surface-selective of the two electron spectroscopies capable of producing data over at least a 10-ev energy range. We have seen intriguing differences between INS and UPS which, when we come to understand them, will most certainly reveal important characteristics of surface electronic structure and greatly expand our ability to distinguish electronic states in the surface from those in the selvedge. Possibly it is not too much to hope that the combined use of INS and UPS with incidence angle as an independent variable will give us information on the geometrical extent of surface orbitals, as well as the net electrical charge and the electric potential gradient in the region of the surface in which the orbitals lie."

https://openalex.org/W1999843870,"A geophysical survey of the southeastern Atlantic Ocean has been made as one of the programs of the International Decade of Ocean Exploration. A large ancient delta of the Orange River and a diapiric field off Angola were mapped. Both features were initiated during early stages of the separation of Africa and South America, and both may be potential sources of oil."
