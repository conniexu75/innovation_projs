https://openalex.org/W2787234767,"Human ALS/FTD patient iPSC-derived neurons are used to uncover mechanisms by which C9ORF72 mutations cause neurodegeneration. An intronic GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but the pathogenic mechanism of this repeat remains unclear. Using human induced motor neurons (iMNs), we found that repeat-expanded C9ORF72 was haploinsufficient in ALS. We found that C9ORF72 interacted with endosomes and was required for normal vesicle trafficking and lysosomal biogenesis in motor neurons. Repeat expansion reduced C9ORF72 expression, triggering neurodegeneration through two mechanisms: accumulation of glutamate receptors, leading to excitotoxicity, and impaired clearance of neurotoxic dipeptide repeat proteins derived from the repeat expansion. Thus, cooperativity between gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms led to neurodegeneration. Restoring C9ORF72 levels or augmenting its function with constitutively active RAB5 or chemical modulators of RAB5 effectors rescued patient neuron survival and ameliorated neurodegenerative processes in both gain- and loss-of-function C9ORF72 mouse models. Thus, modulating vesicle trafficking was able to rescue neurodegeneration caused by the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. Coupled with rare mutations in ALS2, FIG4, CHMP2B, OPTN and SQSTM1, our results reveal mechanistic convergence on vesicle trafficking in ALS and FTD."
https://openalex.org/W2787419526,"The hippocampus is traditionally thought to transmit contextual information to limbic structures where it acquires valence. Using freely moving calcium imaging and optogenetics, we show that while the dorsal CA1 subregion of the hippocampus is enriched in place cells, ventral CA1 (vCA1) is enriched in anxiety cells that are activated by anxiogenic environments and required for avoidance behavior. Imaging cells defined by their projection target revealed that anxiety cells were enriched in the vCA1 population projecting to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) but not to the basal amygdala (BA). Consistent with this selectivity, optogenetic activation of vCA1 terminals in LHA but not BA increased anxiety and avoidance, while activation of terminals in BA but not LHA impaired contextual fear memory. Thus, the hippocampus encodes not only neutral but also valence-related contextual information, and the vCA1-LHA pathway is a direct route by which the hippocampus can rapidly influence innate anxiety behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2787578932,"The adoptive transfer of T cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) (hereafter referred to as CAR-T cells) specific for the B lymphocyte antigen CD19 has shown impressive clinical responses in patients with refractory B cell malignancies. However, the therapeutic effects of CAR-T cells that target other malignancies have not yet resulted in significant clinical benefit. Although inefficient tumor trafficking and various immunosuppressive mechanisms can impede CAR-T cell effector responses, the signals delivered by the current CAR constructs may still be insufficient to fully activate antitumor T cell functions. Optimal T cell activation and proliferation requires multiple signals, including T cell receptor (TCR) engagement (signal 1), co-stimulation (signal 2) and cytokine engagement (signal 3). However, CAR constructs currently being tested in the clinic contain a CD3z (TCR signaling) domain and co-stimulatory domain(s) but not a domain that transmits signal 3 (refs. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18). Here we have developed a novel CAR construct capable of inducing cytokine signaling after antigen stimulation. This new-generation CD19 CAR encodes a truncated cytoplasmic domain from the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor β-chain (IL-2Rβ) and a STAT3-binding tyrosine-X-X-glutamine (YXXQ) motif, together with the TCR signaling (CD3z) and co-stimulatory (CD28) domains (hereafter referred to as 28-ΔIL2RB-z(YXXQ)). The 28-ΔIL2RB-z(YXXQ) CAR-T cells showed antigen-dependent activation of the JAK kinase and of the STAT3 and STAT5 transcription factors signaling pathways, which promoted their proliferation and prevented terminal differentiation in vitro. The 28-ΔIL2RB-z(YXXQ) CAR-T cells demonstrated superior in vivo persistence and antitumor effects in models of liquid and solid tumors as compared with CAR-T cells expressing a CD28 or 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain alone. Taken together, these results suggest that our new-generation CAR has the potential to demonstrate superior antitumor effects with minimal toxicity in the clinic and that clinical translation of this novel CAR is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2793124274,"Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is characterized by widespread and rapid metastasis in the peritoneal cavity. Visceral adipocytes promote this process by providing fatty acids (FAs) for tumour growth. However, the exact mechanism of FA transfer from adipocytes to cancer cells remains unknown. This study shows that OvCa cells co-cultured with primary human omental adipocytes express high levels of the FA receptor, CD36, in the plasma membrane, thereby facilitating exogenous FA uptake. Depriving OvCa cells of adipocyte-derived FAs using CD36 inhibitors and short hairpin RNA knockdown prevented development of the adipocyte-induced malignant phenotype. Specifically, inhibition of CD36 attenuated adipocyte-induced cholesterol and lipid droplet accumulation and reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content. Metabolic analysis suggested that CD36 plays an essential role in the bioenergetic adaptation of OvCa cells in the adipocyte-rich microenvironment and governs their metabolic plasticity. Furthermore, the absence of CD36 affected cellular processes that play a causal role in peritoneal dissemination, including adhesion, invasion, migration and anchorage independent growth. Intraperitoneal injection of CD36-deficient cells or treatment with an anti-CD36 monoclonal antibody reduced tumour burden in mouse xenografts. Moreover, a matched cohort of primary and metastatic human ovarian tumours showed upregulation of CD36 in the metastatic tissues, a finding confirmed in three public gene expression data sets. These results suggest that omental adipocytes reprogram tumour metabolism through the upregulation of CD36 in OvCa cells. Targeting the stromal-tumour metabolic interface via CD36 inhibition may prove to be an effective treatment strategy against OvCa metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2787027993,"Protein aggregation and dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system are hallmarks of many neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we address the elusive link between these phenomena by employing cryo-electron tomography to dissect the molecular architecture of protein aggregates within intact neurons at high resolution. We focus on the poly-Gly-Ala (poly-GA) aggregates resulting from aberrant translation of an expanded GGGGCC repeat in C9orf72, the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. We find that poly-GA aggregates consist of densely packed twisted ribbons that recruit numerous 26S proteasome complexes, while other macromolecules are largely excluded. Proximity to poly-GA ribbons stabilizes a transient substrate-processing conformation of the 26S proteasome, suggesting stalled degradation. Thus, poly-GA aggregates may compromise neuronal proteostasis by driving the accumulation and functional impairment of a large fraction of cellular proteasomes."
https://openalex.org/W2785999368,"Diffuse white-matter disease associated with small-vessel disease and dementia is prevalent in the elderly. The biological mechanisms, however, remain elusive. Using pericyte-deficient mice, magnetic resonance imaging, viral-based tract-tracing, and behavior and tissue analysis, we found that pericyte degeneration disrupted white-matter microcirculation, resulting in an accumulation of toxic blood-derived fibrin(ogen) deposits and blood-flow reductions, which triggered a loss of myelin, axons and oligodendrocytes. This disrupted brain circuits, leading to white-matter functional deficits before neuronal loss occurs. Fibrinogen and fibrin fibrils initiated autophagy-dependent cell death in oligodendrocyte and pericyte cultures, whereas pharmacological and genetic manipulations of systemic fibrinogen levels in pericyte-deficient, but not control mice, influenced the degree of white-matter fibrin(ogen) deposition, pericyte degeneration, vascular pathology and white-matter changes. Thus, our data indicate that pericytes control white-matter structure and function, which has implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of human white-matter disease associated with small-vessel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2785854718,"Cell communication within tissues is mediated by multiple paracrine signals including growth factors, which control cell survival and proliferation. Cells and the growth factors they produce and receive constitute a circuit with specific properties that ensure homeostasis. Here, we used computational and experimental approaches to characterize the features of cell circuits based on growth factor exchange between macrophages and fibroblasts, two cell types found in most mammalian tissues. We found that the macrophage-fibroblast cell circuit is stable and robust to perturbations. Analytical screening of all possible two-cell circuit topologies revealed the circuit features sufficient for stability, including environmental constraint and negative-feedback regulation. Moreover, we found that cell-cell contact is essential for the stability of the macrophage-fibroblast circuit. These findings illustrate principles of cell circuit design and provide a quantitative perspective on cell interactions."

Finally, analysis of chimeric ligands suggests that ligand-receptor clustering underlies dynamic encoding of ligand identity. The ability of the pathway to utilize ligands as distinct communication channels has implications for diverse Notch-dependent processes. In metazoans, the Notch signaling pathway enables communication between neighboring cells. It plays critical roles in the development and maintenance of most tissues (Bray, 2016Bray S.J. Notch signalling in context.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 722-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, Guruharsha et al., 2012Guruharsha K.G. Kankel M.W. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. The Notch signalling system: recent insights into the complexity of a conserved pathway.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), and its dysregulation has been implicated in a variety of diseases, making it an important therapeutic target (Andersson and Lendahl, 2014Andersson E.R. Lendahl U. Therapeutic modulation of Notch signalling--are we there yet?.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2014; 13: 357-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In mammals, Notch signaling can be activated by four different transmembrane ligands: Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2. When these ligands interact with Notch receptors expressed on the surface of neighboring receiver cells, they induce cleavage of the receptor. This releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus and, in complex with CSL/RBPjκ, activates Notch target genes (Figure 1A). In principle, different ligands could be used to activate distinct target programs, and thus could constitute distinct “communication channels.” Indeed, ligand-specific effects of Notch signaling have been observed in multiple contexts and occur even with close paralogs like Dll1 and Dll4 (Figure 1A). For example, Dll4 is unable to replace Dll1 function in many tissues, leading to embryonic lethality in mice when knocked into the Dll1 locus (Preuße et al., 2015Preuße K. Tveriakhina L. Schuster-Gossler K. Gaspar C. Rosa A.I. Henrique D. Gossler A. Stauber M. Context-dependent functional divergence of the Notch ligands DLL1 and DLL4 in vivo.PLoS Genet. 2015; 11: e1005328Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Dll1 and Dll4 also have opposing effects on muscle differentiation: Dll1 expressed in the neural crest induces differentiation of muscle progenitors in somites (Rios et al., 2011Rios A.C. Serralbo O. Salgado D. Marcelle C. Neural crest regulates myogenesis through the transient activation of NOTCH.Nature. 2011; 473: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), while Dll4 expressed in endothelial cells can revert this fate in committed skeletal myoblasts, diverting them to form pericytes instead (Cappellari et al., 2013Cappellari O. Benedetti S. Innocenzi A. Tedesco F.S. Moreno-Fortuny A. Ugarte G. Lampugnani M.G. Messina G. Cossu G. Dll4 and PDGF-BB convert committed skeletal myoblasts to pericytes without erasing their myogenic memory.Dev. Cell. 2013; 24: 586-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Puzzlingly, although Dll1 and Dll4 can behave differently under certain conditions, they appear to function interchangeably in others. For example, when overexpressed, both ligands promote T cell differentiation of primary hematopoietic stem cells in culture, but appear to do so with different efficiencies (Mohtashami et al., 2010Mohtashami M. Shah D.K. Nakase H. Kianizad K. Petrie H.T. Zúñiga-Pflücker J.C. Direct comparison of Dll1- and Dll4-mediated Notch activation levels shows differential lymphomyeloid lineage commitment outcomes.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). How could different ligands induce different responses in signal-receiving cells? Due to the proteolytic mechanism by which all ligands activate Notch, information regarding ligand identity must be represented in the levels or dynamics of NICD in signal-receiving cells. In fact, the Dll1 and Dll4 extracellular domains differ by more than 10-fold in their affinity for Notch (Andrawes et al., 2013Andrawes M.B. Xu X. Liu H. Ficarro S.B. Marto J.A. Aster J.C.

Chem. 2013; 288: 25477-25489Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which could lead to differences in their signaling strength (NICD levels). However, several aspects of the Notch pathway also suggest a potential sensitivity to dynamics. Cleaved NICD has a short half-life, enabling its concentration to respond rapidly to changes in Notch activation (Fryer et al., 2004Fryer C.J. White J.B. Jones K.A.

Lim S. Fulbright M. Piwnica-Worms D. Kopan R. Real-time imaging of notch activation with a luciferase complementation-based reporter.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: rs7Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similarly, the canonical Notch target genes Hes1 and Hes5 have short mRNA and protein half-lives and their levels oscillate in many contexts (Kobayashi and Kageyama, 2014Kobayashi T. Kageyama R. Expression dynamics and functions of Hes factors in development and diseases.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2014; 110: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). While dynamics has been shown to play critical roles in other signaling contexts (Purvis and Lahav, 2013Purvis J.E. Lahav G. Encoding and decoding cellular information through signaling dynamics.Cell. 2013; 152: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), it has not been systematically investigated in the Notch pathway. Here, by quantitatively analyzing Notch1 activation in individual cells, we show that Dll1 and Dll4 generate distinct patterns of direct target gene expression by encoding ligand identity in Notch1 activation dynamics. Specifically, Dll1 induces pulses of Notch activation, while Dll4 induces sustained activity. These dynamics are in turn decoded to control relative levels of Hes1 and Hey1/L target gene expression. Notch activity in receiving cells is thus inherently multi-dimensional, possessing both an activation type (pulsatile or sustained) and an activation level. This ability to respond in a ligand-specific fashion enables signal sending cells to use different ligands to activate distinct Notch target programs in receiving cells, effectively expanding the number of communication channels in the Notch pathway. In order to directly compare Notch1 signaling by Dll1 and Dll4 at the single cell level, we constructed “sender” and “receiver” cell lines in CHO-K1 cells (Figure 1B). Sender cells expressed either Dll1 or Dll4 along with a co-translational H2B-mCherry readout, under control of a 4epi-tetracycline (4epi-Tc)-induced promoter (LeBon et al., 2014LeBon L. Lee T.V.

We engineered receiver cells to express chimeric Notch1 receptors whose intracellular domain is replaced by the transcription factor Gal4 (Lecourtois and Schweisguth, 1998Lecourtois M. Schweisguth F.

Nuclear access and action of notch in vivo.Cell. 1998; 93: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), along with an H2B-3xCitrine fluorescent protein reporter that can be activated by Gal4 (Figure 1B). This “diverted” reporter system enables readout of Notch activity without activation of endogenous Notch targets, avoiding potential complications due to downstream feedback interactions. To compare dynamics of signaling by Dll1 and Dll4, we used time-lapse microscopy of sender-receiver co-cultures. In these experiments, a minority of receiver cells were co-cultured with an excess of either Dll1 or Dll4 sender cells so that each receiver cell was in continuous contact with one or more sender cells (Figure 1C). Increases in the level of stable H2B-3xCitrine fluorescence in receiver cells reflect the activity of Gal4 released from activated receptors. Specifically, the rate of increase in total fluorescence (dCitrine/dt, “promoter activity”) is controlled by the concentration of released Gal4 (Figures S1A and S1B). We therefore estimated the Notch activity from the time derivative of each fluorescent protein trace, computed by calculating the change in total nuclear fluorescence from one time point to the next (30 min apart, see STAR Methods). Under these experimental conditions, Dll4-expressing sender cells activated receivers in a sustained fashion. After plating, individual receiver cells activated Citrine production and continued to actively produce Citrine for the duration of the experiment (Figures 1C and 1D; Movie S1). The sustained nature of Dll4 signaling was also reflected in the average response of these cells (Figure S1C). To extract stereotyped features of the average response shape, independent of cell-cell variation in signaling amplitude and timing of activation, we normalized each trace by its maximal level and temporally aligned the resulting traces at the point of activation (Figure S1D; STAR Methods). This procedure sharpened the sustained nature of response to Dll4 (Figure 1D). In contrast, in co-culture with Dll1-expressing senders the same receiver cells activated in discrete, transient pulses (Figures 1C and 1E; Movie S2). In each pulse, the rate of Citrine production increased transiently, and then returned to baseline, displaying a characteristic shape (Figures 1E, S1C, and S1D). Pulses occurred in an unsynchronized fashion, initiating at different times in different receiver cells and could occur throughout the experiment (Figure S1E). Most cells under these conditions displayed a single pulse during the experiment (60% of traces), while two pulses could be detected in other traces (35%) (Figure S1F; Movie S3). Dll1 pulses displayed peak amplitudes comparable to the amplitude observed during the corresponding period of Dll4 signaling (Figure 1F). These results indicate that Dll1 activates Notch1 through stochastic stereotyped pulses. In order to better understand pulsatile Dll1 signaling dynamics, we sought to estimate the duration of the underlying pulse of Notch activation, accounting for the half-lives of Gal4 protein and H2B-Citrine mRNA, which extend the duration of the observed reporter pulse. We used a mathematical model of reporter activation (STAR Methods) to analyze the decay of Citrine production rate following inhibition of Notch signaling (Figures S1G and S1H) and computed values for the half-lives of Gal4 protein (∼4 hr, 95% confidence interval [CI] [3.8 hr, 4 hr]) and H2B-3xCitrine mRNA (∼3.4 hr, 95% CI [3.4 hr, 3.5 hr]). Together with the measured duration (∼12 hr full-width at half-maximum [FWHM]) and rise-time (∼6 hr, “trise”) of the Dll1-induced reporter activity pulses (Figure S1I), this enabled us to estimate an upper bound of ∼1 hr on the duration of the underlying signaling events (Figure S1J). Simulations showed that pulses briefer than this would produce indistinguishable reporter dynamics (Figure S1K). As discussed more below, these brief pulses likely represent events in which multiple Notch receptors are activated (cleaved) simultaneously. We next asked whether the apparently sustained Dll4 signaling could be explained as a series of Dll1-like pulses, occurring at an elevated rate (Figure S2A). We computationally generated pulse trains composed of pulses with the same shape and amplitude distribution observed for Dll1 pulses (Figure S2B; STAR Methods). We varied both the regularity of the pulses, using dynamic models ranging from periodic to Poisson distributed, as well as the pulse frequency (or mean interval between pulses) within each model, and analyzed the amplitude and temporal (“intra-trace”) variability of the simulated pulse trains (Figures S2C and S2D). Higher pulse frequencies lead to greater pulse overlap, increasing signaling amplitude, while reducing the temporal variability of signaling (Figure S2E). Critically, tuning pulse frequency low enough to match the observed mean Dll4 signaling amplitude generated significantly greater temporal variability than observed experimentally (Figures S2E, inset, and S2F), suggesting that the observed sustained Dll4 signaling cannot be explained as a series of Dll1-like pulses. Furthermore, the difference in experimentally observed Dll1 and Dll4 dynamics was preserved even when the time resolution of the reporter was improved from 6–12 hr (trise–FWHM, Figure S1G) to 2.5–6 hr by destabilizing the Citrine mRNA (Figures S2G–S2I). Taken together, these data and analysis strongly suggest that Dll1 and Dll4 activate Notch1 with distinct dynamics, Dll1 through brief pulses, and Dll4 in a sustained fashion. We note, however, that this does not rule out the possibility that Dll4 signaling originates from a series of smaller pulses (in the extreme limit, individual ligand-receptor activation events can be thought of as small, discrete “pulses”). We next asked how the expression level of each ligand in the sender cell modulated signaling dynamics. To isolate signaling events produced by individual sender cells, we reversed the conditions of the assay, co-culturing an excess of receiver cells with a minority of sender cells (STAR Methods). We analyzed Dll1 senders across a >10-fold range of Dll1 expression levels (Figure S2J). Over this range, most receiver cells activated in pulses (Figure 2A, bottom panels; Movie S4), which maintained the same stereotyped shape and duration (Figure 2B, right panels) and showed a 1.6-fold increase in amplitude (Figure 2C, right panels). At the same time, we observed a stronger increase in the number of activated receiver cells with increasing Dll1 expression, reflecting an increase in pulse frequency (Figure 2D). Together, these results indicate that Dll1 expression levels modulate signaling predominantly through the frequency of stereotyped signaling pulses (Figure 2E, left panel). Unlike Dll1, Dll4 showed sustained activation in the excess receiver assay across all levels of Dll4 expression analyzed (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2K; Movie S5). We observed a systematic increase in peak (Figure 2C, left panels) and median (Figure S2L) signaling amplitude with increasing Dll4 expression level over a 10-fold range (Figure S2K). Together, these results indicate that Dll1 and Dll4 produce qualitatively different signaling dynamics across a broad range of expression and signaling levels and modulate those dynamics in distinct ways, with Dll1 mainly controlling the frequency of stereotyped pulses and Dll4 controlling the amplitude of sustained signaling (Figure 2E). We next asked whether the different dynamics produced by Dll1 and Dll4 activation could regulate distinct sets of target genes and thereby allow cells to discriminate between the ligands. To directly test the effect of NICD dynamics on target gene expression, we took advantage of the fact that truncated Notch1 receptors lacking most of their extracellular domain (N1ΔECD) are constitutively active, but can be inhibited by DAPT (Fortini et al., 1993Fortini M.E. Rebay I. Caron L.A. Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

USA. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). Cells expressing N1ΔECD can therefore be activated for different durations and to varying levels by controlling DAPT concentration in the media for corresponding time intervals (STAR Methods). We stably expressed N1ΔECD in C2C12 cells, where the binding of the NICD-CSL complex to target gene promoters has been previously characterized using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) (Castel et al., 2013Castel D. Mourikis P. Bartels S.J.J. Brinkman A.B. Tajbakhsh S. Stunnenberg H.G. Dynamic binding of RBPJ is determined by Notch signaling status.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (STAR Methods), we identified genes that were upregulated at early time points (1 hr or 6 hr) following Notch activation by DAPT removal (Figures S3A and S3B; Table S1). We focused specifically on putative direct Notch targets previously shown to bind the CSL-NICD complex in this cell line (Castel et al., 2013Castel D. Mourikis P. Bartels S.J.J. Brinkman A.B. Tajbakhsh S. Stunnenberg H.G. Dynamic binding of RBPJ is determined by Notch signaling status.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Other genes that were activated were not considered for further analysis because they are not known Notch targets; several of these genes have been shown to be induced by growth factor signaling, suggesting that they could have induced by media change during DAPT removal (Allan et al., 2001Allan A.L. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. LaMarre J. Activating transcription factor 3 induces DNA synthesis and expression of cyclin D1 in hepatocytes.J. Biol.

Med. 2017; 23: 472-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, even direct Notch target genes responded to activation of the pathway at different times (Figure 3B). Hes1, but not the other target genes, was rapidly activated, showing strong (∼10-fold) upregulation by 1 hr (Figures 3B and S3A; Table S1). Other Notch targets such as Hey1, HeyL, Jag1, and Nrarp responded later, showing little change at 1 hr, but strong upregulation by 6 hr (Figures 3B and S3B; Table S1). In order to follow the early and later phases of response in finer detail, we carried out a real-time qPCR time course measurement of Hes1, Hey1, and HeyL mRNA levels following DAPT removal (Figure 3C). Hes1 expression increased rapidly, within 30 min, and its levels peaked at 1 hr. By contrast, Hey1/L levels did not significantly increase until the end of the Hes1 activation pulse, at 2 hr, after which they continued to rise until reaching a steady state around 4 hr. These results suggested the possibility that brief (<1 hr) pulses of Notch activation could selectively activate Hes1, with the other targets requiring longer durations of Notch signaling. To test this hypothesis, we used real-time qPCR to analyze the response of Hes1 and Hey1/L to varying durations and amplitudes of Notch activation (STAR Methods). We observed that Hes1 activation was relatively insensitive to the duration of Notch activation and could be induced strongly by brief pulses (5–30 min) and by sustained activation (Figure 3D). On the other hand, Hey1 and HeyL were more sensitive to duration, accumulating continuously as long as Notch activation was maintained (Figures 3D and S3C). In order to isolate the effects of signaling duration from those of signal amplitude, we compared Hey1/L expression at the same instantaneous NICD concentrations but after different durations of NICD exposure (Figures S3D–S3G). Specifically, we compared a brief pulse of NICD generated by total DAPT removal for 15 min, with a longer (3 hr) duration of NICD activity generated by partial removal of DAPT to 0.3 μM. These two perturbations produce the same final concentration of NICD but differ in the duration of NICD activity (Figures S3D and S3E). If NICD concentration alone controlled Hey1/L expression, then the two conditions should produce similar rates of Hey1/L synthesis (Figure S3F, top). By contrast, a requirement for sustained NICD activity would lead to a greater rate of Hey1/L expression in the prolonged case (Figure S3F, bottom). For each condition, we measured the increase of Hey1/L levels in a 30-min window in order to estimate new Hey1/L expression at the corresponding time-point (Figure S3F). We observed increased Hey1/L expression only at the 3 hr time point, indicating that an extended period of activity is required for efficient activation (Figure S3G). Higher NICD concentrations were not able to overcome the requirement for extended activation, as a 30-min pulse of total DAPT withdrawal, which produced higher NICD concentrations, did not increase Hey1/L expression (Figures S3D and S3G). NICD concentration did, however, affect the maximum induction levels of the Hes/Hey genes under sustained activation (Figure S3H). Finally, we note that the weakness of the Hey1/L response to brief activation pulses was not due to insufficient NICD, as the Notch1ΔECD system produces more NICD from DAPT withdrawal over 30 min than observed in Notch1-expressing receiver cells co-cultured with sender cells expressing maximal levels of Dll4 (Figure S3I). Together, these results indicate that pulsatile and sustained Notch dynamics are decoded into distinct gene expression patterns, with Hes1 responding strongly even to brief pulses and Hey1 and HeyL requiring sustained activation. Based on the different responses of Hes1 and Hey1/L to Notch dynamics, we hypothesized that Dll1 signaling could activate Hes1 without significantly inducing the Hey genes, while Dll4 could more strongly upregulate Hey1/L, even at similar Hes1 induction levels. To test this hypothesis, we used a C2C12 cell line constitutively expressing wild-type Notch1, with its endogenous Notch2 knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA) (STAR Methods). We first verified that the dynamic differences between Dll1 and Dll4 activation of Notch1 are preserved in this cell line, even at similar mean levels of Notch activity (Figures S4A–S4C). We then co-cultured this cell line with CHO-K1 cells expressing Dll1, Dll4, or no ligand, and measured Hes1, Hey1, and HeyL mRNA levels by real-time qPCR (Figures S4D and S4E). We found that for the same, reproducible, 1.6-fold upregulation in mean Hes1 levels, Dll4 induced ∼3- to 5-fold more Hey1/L than Dll1 did (Figure S4E). This result is consistent with the different signaling dynamics of Dll1 and Dll4 inducing different Hes/Hey expression regimes. By contrast, signaling levels (amplitudes) do influence the levels of both Hes and Hey1/L expression, but do so proportionately (Figure S3H), and therefore cannot explain the disproportionate induction of these gene sets by Dll1 and Dll4. Further, we used a complementary imaging approach to analyze the effects of single (or few) sender cells on neighboring receivers, by using plating conditions that allowed the two cell types to contact each other predominantly along a linear interface (Figure S4F; STAR Methods). Gene expression was analyzed by hybridization chain reaction-fluorescence in situ hybridization (HCR-FISH), which provides an amplified single-cell readout of specific mRNA levels (Choi et al., 2010Choi H.M.T. Chang J.Y. Trinh A. Padilla J.E. Fraser S.E. Pierce N.A. Programmable in situ amplification for multiplexed imaging of mRNA expression.Nat.

Abelin A.C.T. et al.Mapping a multiplexed zoo of mRNA expression.Development. 2016; 143: 3632-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In these experiments, we similarly observed that Dll4 senders, but not Dll1 senders, strongly upregulated Hey1/L in neighboring receiver cells (Figures S4G and S4H). Changes in Hes1 mRNA levels were more difficult to observe at the single cell level using this technique, due to the basal expression of Hes1 (Table S1) and the stochastic, unsynchronized nature of Dll1 pulses. Nevertheless, these results further support the conclusion that Dll1 and Dll4 activate different Hes/Hey gene expression regimes, with Dll4 producing a higher expression of Hey1/L compared to Dll1 at similar Hes1 levels. We next sought to test the ability of Notch receiving cells to distinguish between Dll1 and Dll4 in the in vivo context of embryonic myogenesis in chick somites. In the developing embryo, it has been shown that Dll1 expressed in migrating neural crest cells signals to Notch1 expressed in the dorsomedial lip (DML) of the neighboring somite. This interaction promotes differentiation of Pax7+ progenitor cells in the DML by upregulating the muscle regulatory factors Myf5 and MyoD1, likely via Hes1 (Rios et al., 2011Rios A.C. Serralbo O. Salgado D. Marcelle C. Neural crest regulates myogenesis through the transient activation of NOTCH.Nature. 2011; 473: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (Figure 4A). Critically, in this system, transient activation of the Notch pathway enables normal muscle differentiation, while sustained activation inhibits this process (Rios et al., 2011Rios A.C. Serralbo O. Salgado D. Marcelle C. Neural crest regulates myogenesis through the transient activation of NOTCH.Nature. 2011; 473: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our results thus far suggest that transient and sustained Notch activation are intrinsic properties of the Dll1 and Dll4 ligands, respectively. Therefore, we predicted that the pulsatile dynamics of Dll1 would promote myogenic fate, while the sustained dynamics produced by Dll4 would inhibit myogenesis in the same cells. To test this possibility, we electroporated either Dll1 or Dll4 into the neural crest unilaterally in stage HH 12-13 chick embryos, using the other side as a negative control (Elena de Bellard and Bronner-Fraser, 2005Elena de Bellard M.

Given that the defining feature of movement is change with time, progress may benefit from more detailed comparisons of time-evolving patterns of neural and muscle activity. To afford such comparisons, an ideal task would achieve the traditional goal of dissociating kinematics from muscle activity (Kakei et al., 1999Kakei S. Hoffman D.S. Strick P.L. Muscle and movement representations in the primary motor cortex.Science. 1999; 285: 2136-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, Scott and Kalaska, 1997Scott S.H. Kalaska J.F.

This has been achieved during reaches (Churchland and Shenoy, 2007Churchland M.M. Shenoy K.V. Temporal complexity and heterogeneity of single-neuron activity in premotor and motor cortex.J.

Unlike in sensory systems where responses strongly reflect incoming stimuli, time-evolving responses in the motor system may reflect computations performed by internal and feedback dynamics. A growing body of work seeks to understand neural responses in terms of signals that a recurrent or feedback-driven neural network would need to perform the relevant task (Hennequin et al., 2014Hennequin G.

Opening the black box: low-dimensional dynamics in high-dimensional recurrent neural networks.Neural Comput. 2013; 25: 626-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Although multiple network solutions are typically possible, broad principles can still apply. For example, the simple constraint of a smooth dynamical flow-field explains aspects of neural dynamics during reaching (Sussillo et al., 2015Sussillo D. Churchland M.M. Kaufman M.T. Shenoy K.V. A neural network that finds a naturalistic solution for the production of muscle activity.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Here, we leverage a “cycling” task that evoked extended movements with simple kinematics driven by temporally complex patterns of muscle activity. We found that single neurons and muscles shared many temporal response properties. Yet the neural population as a whole was dominated by signals that were not muscle-like and were not explained by velocity/direction coding. Seeking an alternative explanation, we focused on a basic principle of recurrent and feedback-driven networks: the present network state strongly influences the future state. Thus, two similar patterns of activity, observed at different moments, should not lead to highly dissimilar patterns in the near future. We refer to violations of this principle as “trajectory tangling.” Moments of high tangling imply either a potential instability in network dynamics or a moment when the system must rely on external commands. Tangling was often high for muscle population trajectories. This was expected: muscles reflect descending commands and need not avoid tangling. In contrast, tangling was very low for motor cortex population trajectories. This was found not only during cycling, but also during a reaching task, and in rodent during reach-to-grasp and locomotion. However, low tangling was anatomically specific and was not observed for primary visual or somatosensory cortex. We found that the dominant signals in motor cortex were those that naturally reduced tangling. Using an optimization approach, we could quantitatively predict the neural population response based on only two principles: the need to encode muscle-like commands and the need to ensure low tangling. Network simulations confirm that low trajectory tangling is computationally beneficial. Networks with lower tangling are more noise robust. In summary, our data reveal a potentially general property of motor cortex: muscle-like signals are present but are relatively modest “ripples” riding on top of larger signals that confer minimal tangling. Thus, the dominant signals in motor cortex may serve not a representational function—encoding specific variables—but rather a computational function: ensuring that outgoing commands can be generated reliably. We trained two rhesus macaque monkeys to grasp a hand-pedal and cycle for juice reward. Cycling produced movement through a virtual landscape. Landscape color indicated whether forward virtual motion required “forward” cycling (Figure 1A) or “backward” cycling (Figure 1B). During each trial, the monkey progressed from one stationary target to another. Target acquisition required a stationary pedal with the target “under” the first person perspective (Figures 1A and 1B). The first target was acquired with a pedal orientation either straight up (“top-start”) or straight down (“bottom-start”). Inter-target distance determined the required number of revolutions: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 7 cycles. Monkeys performed all combinations of two cycling directions, two starting orientations, and five distances. Cycling required overcoming simulated inertia and viscosity while countering the weight of an arm extended in front of the body. These requirements differ from those during locomotion and had to be learned. Behavior was highly stereotyped; note similarity of virtual-world-position traces across trials in Figures 1C and 1D. Nevertheless, small trial-to-trial variations in cycling speed caused accumulating misalignment of kinematics with time. We thus temporally scaled trials so that virtual-world-position traces were closely matched. Doing so revealed considerable temporal structure in neural and electromyographic (EMG) responses (Figures 1E and 1F). To summarize such structure, we computed average firing rate (Figure 1G) or muscle activation (Figure 1H) across trials. We used a narrow filter (25-ms Gaussian kernel) relative to the timescale of behavior (∼500-ms cycling period) to preserve fine temporal features. We similarly computed trial-averaged responses for key kinematic parameters such as hand velocity. Consistent with the circular motion, vertical and horizontal hand velocity exhibited approximately sinusoidal profiles (Figures 2A and 2B ) that repeated across middle cycles and were slightly slower during initial/terminal cycles as angular velocity ramped up and down. Top- and bottom-start movements differed in phase but were otherwise similar during middle cycles. Intramuscular EMG recordings (35 and 29 sites in monkey D and C) concentrated on muscles that moved the shoulder and elbow and to a lesser degree the wrist (which had limited mobility given the pedal design). Muscle activity (Figures 2C–2E) generally followed intuitions from biomechanics. For example, the triceps muscle extends the elbow, moving the hand away from the body. Accordingly, triceps activity (Figure 2D) peaked near each cycle’s apex (white shading) when cycling forward and near its bottom (dark shading) when cycling backward. Some muscle responses were roughly sinusoidal and resembled kinematics, yet deviations from sinusoidal were common (e.g., Figure 2E). Well-isolated single neurons (103 and 109, monkeys D and C) were sequentially recorded from motor cortex, including sulcal and surface primary motor cortex and the immediately adjacent aspect of dorsal premotor cortex (potential differences within this population are explored later). Recordings were localized to the region where microstimulation activated muscles from which we recorded. Cycling evoked strong responses; nearly all neurons that could be isolated were task modulated. Peak firing rates ranged from 16 to 184 spikes/s (monkey D, mean: 69 spikes/s) and 16 to 185 spikes/s (monkey C, mean: 76 spikes/s). Neurons displayed a variety of intricate response patterns (Figure 3). These patterns were statistically reliable: SEMs were small and the same pattern could be seen repeatedly across middle cycles for both top- and bottom-start conditions. Inspection revealed three features shared between muscles and neurons. First, responses often deviated from the sinusoidal profile of kinematics (e.g., Figure 2E, backward; Figure 3A, forward). Second, responses during initial/terminal cycles often displayed differences in amplitude or temporal profile compared to middle cycles (e.g., Figure 2D, forward; Figure 3D, forward; Figure 3E, backward). This effect presumably relates to the unique force patterns required to start and stop. Third, responses could differ between forward and backward cycling in both amplitude (e.g., Figures 2C and 3C) and structure (e.g., Figures 2E, 3A, and 3F). Consistent with these shared features, muscle responses could be successfully decoded from the neural population using a linear model (leave-one-out-cross-validated R2 = 0.80 and 0.78) consistent with prior studies (Griffin et al., 2008Griffin D.M. Hudson H.M. Belhaj-Saïf A. McKiernan B.J. Cheney P.D. Do corticomotoneuronal cells predict target muscle EMG activity?.J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 99: 1169-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Morrow et al., 2009Morrow M.M. Pohlmeyer E.A. Miller L.E. Control of muscle synergies by cortical ensembles.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2009; 629: 179-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, Schieber and Rivlis, 2007Schieber M.H. Rivlis G. Partial reconstruction of muscle activity from a pruned network of diverse motor cortex neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is potentially impressive, given that a linear model is almost certainly too simplistic. This finding might suggest that motor cortex activity primarily reflects muscle-like commands. However, decoding neural activity from muscle activity was less successful (leave-one-out-cross-validated R2 = 0.54 and 0.50). This discrepancy in fit quality was not simply due to neural recordings having higher sampling error than muscle recordings. The same discrepancy was observed when neural responses were de-noised using dimensionality reduction techniques (STAR Methods). Thus, while muscle-like signals can be found in the neural data, there exist additional, non-muscle-like neural response patterns. To characterize population responses, we applied principal component analysis (PCA), a standard unsupervised algorithm that identifies the dominant signals in multi-dimensional data (Figure 4). Each such signal is a weighted combination of individual-neuron responses, with those weights (the PCs) optimized such that a small number of signals faithfully summarizes the full population response. We first examine the signals captured by the top two PCs. Plotting these signals versus one another yields a state-space trajectory (Figure 4C). Each point on the trajectory (e.g., the orange dot in Figure 4C) corresponds to the neural state at one moment (dashed line in Figures 4A and 4B). A two-dimensional trajectory provides only a partial summary of the neural state, but the resulting visualization can still be informative and inspire hypotheses. Neural trajectories for monkey D are shown during both forward and backward cycling (Figure 4E, top and bottom subpanels). Top-start and bottom-start trajectories are superimposed. For monkey C, trajectories during forward and backward cycling are also superimposed (Figure 4H). For illustrative purposes, data are shown only for seven-cycle conditions (as in Figures 1, 2, and 3). Middle cycles (3–5) are highlighted in color. Neural trajectories followed repeating orbits throughout the middle cycles. Rotating orbits are expected during cycling, in contrast to reaching (Churchland et al., 2012Churchland M.M. Cunningham J.P. Kaufman M.T. Foster J.D. Nuyujukian P. Ryu S.I. Shenoy K.V. Neural population dynamics during reaching.Nature. 2012; 487: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), and simply reflect what can be observed in single neurons: middle-cycle responses tend to repeat. Muscle trajectories also followed repeating orbits (Figures 4D and 4G). Despite this basic similarity, neural and muscle trajectories behaved differently. Muscle trajectories counter-rotated: they orbited in opposing directions for forward and backward cycling. Counter-rotation is expected given the reversal of required force patterns. For example, forward cycling requires lifting before pushing and backward cycling requires pushing before lifting. In contrast, neural trajectories co-rotated: they orbited in the same direction for forward and backward cycling. Furthermore, muscle trajectories tended to depart from circular: the orbit often possessed a kidney- or saddle-like shape. In contrast, neural trajectories were more circular or elliptical. Thus, the dominant signals in the neural population differ from those in the muscle population. A potential explanation for non-muscle-like patterns in motor cortex is that they encode directional signals such as hand velocity (e.g., Moran and Schwartz, 1999bMoran D.W. Schwartz A.B. Motor cortical representation of speed and direction during reaching.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 2676-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). This explanation initially seems appealing given the present data. For example, the neural trajectory during backward cycling for monkey D (Figure 4E, bottom) visually resembles the corresponding velocity trajectory (Figure 4F, bottom). However, velocity trajectories necessarily counter-rotate between forward and backward cycling (the same would be true of hand direction or position). The dominant signals in the neural data do just the opposite. Combined with the fact that single-neuron response profiles typically do not resemble hand velocity or position traces, it seems unlikely that a simple representation of kinematic parameters can explain the dominant neural signals. An alternative explanation is that the dominant neural signals may constitute descending commands to the"
https://openalex.org/W2786172279,"Patterns of spontaneous brain activity, typically measured in humans at rest with fMRI, are used routinely to assess the brain's functional organization. The mechanisms that generate and coordinate the underlying neural fluctuations are largely unknown. Here we investigate the hypothesis that the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), the principal source of widespread cholinergic and GABAergic projections to the cortex, contributes critically to such activity. We reversibly inactivated two distinct sites of the NBM in macaques while measuring fMRI activity across the brain. We found that inactivation led to strong, regionalized suppression of shared or ""global"" signal components of cortical fluctuations ipsilateral to the injection. At the same time, the commonly studied resting-state networks retained their spatial structure under this suppression. The results indicate that the NBM contributes selectively to the global component of functional connectivity but plays little if any role in the specific correlations that define resting-state networks."

This study investigates the structural basis of polypharmacology at canonical GPCRs and illustrates how understanding characteristic patterns of ligand-receptor interaction and activation may ultimately facilitate drug design at multiple GPCRs. For effective G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) drug discovery, some degree of receptor selectivity is essential to avoid deleterious “off-target” interactions with related GPCRs and other druggable targets (e.g., ion channels, kinases, enzymes, and so on) (Elkins et al., 2016Elkins J.M.

As GPCRs frequently have conserved orthosteric binding pockets, drugs targeting these sites often interact with multiple molecular targets; the process whereby drugs bind to many targets is known as polypharmacology. Indeed, creating effective medications which are selective (e.g., “magic bullets”) is not only difficult but also frequently unsuccessful, particularly for complex CNS disorders where the etiologies may be multifactorial and polygenic (Boyle et al., 2017Boyle E.A.

In fact, drugs with a polypharmacological basis (e.g., “magic shotguns”) are frequently more effective therapeutics (Roth et al., 2004Roth B.L. Sheffler D.J. Kroeze W.K.

The rational design of drugs that simultaneously interact with multiple GPCRs, therefore, has the potential to yield medications with improved efficacy for complex disorders (Besnard et al., 2012Besnard J.

Structure-based drug design approaches have facilitated the creation of selective GPCR drugs (Wang et al., 2017Wang S. Wacker D. Levit A. Che T. Betz R.M. McCorvy J.D. Venkatakrishnan A.J. Huang X.P.

Hübner H. et al.Structure-based discovery of opioid analgesics with reduced side effects.Nature. 2016; 537: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Structure-guided approaches, perforce, require high-resolution crystal structures in order to exploit ligand-binding pocket interactions at the targeted GPCR (Wacker et al., 2017aWacker D.

However, structure-guided drug design will not typically predict a compound’s off-target actions. Ultimately, structure-based polypharmacological drug design will require many high-resolution GPCR structures with various chemotypes to illuminate how polypharmacology might be achieved at multiple defined drug targets. The 5-HT2C serotonin receptor (5-HT2C) is a validated target for anti-obesity medications as illustrated by the selective 5-HT2C agonist lorcaserin (Belviq). The 5-HT2C is also a potential therapeutic target for depression, schizophrenia, drug addiction, and other disorders (McCorvy and Roth, 2015McCorvy J.D. Roth B.L.

Creating selective 5-HT2C agonists is extremely challenging, however, as off-target agonist activity at the closely related 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors leads to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-like hallucinations (Nichols, 2016Nichols D.E. Psychedelics.Pharmacol. Rev. 2016; 68: 264-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) and cardiac valvulopathy (Roth, 2007Roth B.L. Drugs and valvular heart disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 6-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Moreover, the 5-HT2C exhibits several RNA-edited isoforms, where the non-edited isoform (INI) displays high constitutive activity that can be exploited to quantify an inverse agonist’s activity (Barker et al., 1994Barker E.L. Westphal R.S. Schmidt D. Sanders-Bush E. Constitutively active 5-hydroxytryptamine2C receptors reveal novel inverse agonist activity of receptor ligands.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11687-11690PubMed Google Scholar). To date, only two serotonin receptor structures have been solved: the 5-HT1B and the 5-HT2B, both in complex with ergotamine (ERG) (Wacker et al., 2013Wacker D. Wang C. Katritch V. Han G.W.

ERG is a naturally occurring ergot anti-migraine drug that contains an ergoline nucleus, a common chemotype for many drugs including LSD, bromocriptine, methysergide, and lisuride. ERG, however, has a complex polypharmacological profile with serious side effects, including cardiac valvulopathy via 5-HT2B serotonin receptor agonism, which limits its widespread use as an anti-migraine medication. In contrast, ritanserin (RIT) is a selective 5-HT2 receptor inverse agonist that has been previously investigated as an adjunct for antipsychotic medications (Den Boer et al., 2000Den Boer J.A. Vahlne J.O. Post P. Heck A.H. Daubenton F. Olbrich R. Ritanserin as add-on medication to neuroleptic therapy for patients with chronic or subchronic schizophrenia.Hum. Psychopharmacol. 2000; 15: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RIT contains a 4-benzylidenepiperidine core scaffold, which is also found in the promiscuous antipsychotic clozapine. The 4-benzylidenepiperidine is a known privileged scaffold with applications for exploiting multiple GPCRs to yield a desired polypharmacological profile (Garland and Gloriam, 2011Garland S.L.

Chem. 2011; 11: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here, we present the structures of the 5-HT2C INI isoform in complex with both the polypharmacological agonist ERG and the selective inverse agonist RIT in order to clarify the structural features responsible for GPCR polypharmacology. To this end, we reveal the active-like state 5-HT2C receptor structure with ERG and, for comparison, an inactive state with RIT. Knowledge of these crystal structures will facilitate the basis of chemotype-specific recognition, inverse agonism, and receptor activation and will enable polypharmacological drug design. The human 5-HT2C was crystallized with a thermostabilized apocytochrome b562RIL (BRIL) fused to the third intracellular loop (IL3) and a single C360N7.45 thermostabilizing mutation (superscripts denote amino acid position as described by Ballesteros and Weinstein, 1995Ballesteros J.A.

ERG and RIT have different chemical scaffolds with distinct 5-HT2C activity: ERG acts as an agonist, whereas RIT is an inverse agonist for both Gαq-inositol phosphate accumulation and β-arrestin2 recruitment (Figure S3). These differential efficacies are mirrored by their distinctive binding modes as observed in the 5-HT2C crystal structures, where the only common interaction is the salt bridge between the protonated nitrogen of the ligand and the conserved aspartate, D1343.32—a canonical interaction for aminergic and many other GPCRs (Figure 2A). Compared to the ERG-bound structure, RIT binds approximately one helical turn deeper into the TM bundle (Figure 2B), which is outside of the recognized orthosteric site of other solved aminergic GPCR structures (Venkatakrishnan et al., 2013Venkatakrishnan A.J.

By contrast, ERG’s shallower binding pose allows an aromatic interaction only with F3286.52 and van der Waals (vdW) contact with W3246.48 (Figures 2B and 2H).Figure 2Different Binding Modes of ERG and RIT in 5-HT2CShow full caption(A–D) Superposition of the 5-HT2C-ERG (orange) and RIT (green) ligand binding pockets with an overview and close-up views of the orthosteric and extended binding sites.

Data represent mean ± SEM of three independent experiments performed in duplicate (E and F). See also Tables S2 and S7. The deep binding pose of RIT in the 5-HT2C is characterized by one of the 4-fluorophenyl groups encased in a hydrophobic pocket between helices V and VI, where it interacts via halogen-aromatic interactions with F2235.47 and F3206.44 and aromatic edge-to-face π-π stacking interactions with residues F3286.52 and W3246.48, the purported “toggle switch” important for GPCR activation (Figures 2B and 2G) (Preininger et al., 2013Preininger A.M. Meiler J. Hamm H.E. Conformational flexibility and structural dynamics in GPCR-mediated G protein activation: a perspective.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 2288-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We validated RIT’s binding pose by mutating W3246.48, F2235.47 and F3206.44, all of which decreased RIT’s affinity (Figures 2E and 2F; Table S2). The W324L6.48 mutation especially reduced RIT affinity by >1,000-fold, whereas W324F6.48 and W324Y6.48 mutations, which preserve the aromatic character of this residue, had substantially less effects on RIT binding affinity (Figure 2E; Table S2). These mutations support the hypothesis that the 4-fluorophenyl moiety is dependent on π-π stacking interactions below the commonly recognized aminergic orthosteric site and that these interactions with W3246.48 are apparently driving RIT’s deep binding pose. The second 4-fluorophenyl group of RIT occupies essentially the same site as the indole of ERG and is lined by V1353.33, T1393.37, V1854.56, S2195.43, A2225.46, and F3276.51 (Figure 2D), with the aromatic ring systems positioned orthogonally to one another in the binding pocket (Figures 2A and 2D). The second 4-fluorophenyl group also apparently “pushes” against the backbone of helix V at residue G2185.42 (Figure 2D). Mutation of this residue to G218A5.42 attenuates RITs binding affinity more than 10-fold (Figure 2F) but only has a modest effect on ERG affinity, further supporting the differential binding poses (Table S2). The thiazolopyrimidine of RIT, which stems from the charged nitrogen of the 4-benzylidenepiperidine core scaffold, is located orthogonally to the ergoline ring in the 5-HT2C-ERG structure and is positioned toward helices II and VII interacting with Y118EL1, V208EL2, F3276.51, N3517.36 and V3547.39 (Figure 2C). The ligand contacts at EL2 also differ between the 5-HT2C-RIT and 5-HT2C-ERG structures as RIT has only hydrophobic vdW contacts, but ERG engages in a hydrogen bond with the backbone of L209EL2 (Figure 2C). Finally, ERG’s terminal benzyl moiety extends much further toward the extracellular loops of the receptor than RIT making vdW contacts with residues L209 in EL2 and V2155.39, S3346.58, and V3356.59 at the topmost turns of helices V and VI (Figure 2H). Comparison of the 5-HT2C-ERG and 5-HT2C-RIT crystal structures also provides key insights into activation-related conformational changes in 5-HT2C. Importantly, the intracellular end of the helix VI in 5-HT2C-ERG is tilted outward by 7.0 Å and helix III is shifted inward by 6.6 Å compared to the 5-HT2C-RIT structure (Figure 1B, bottom panel). Hydrogen bonds between the highly conserved D1343.32 and Y3587.43 are observed in both structures (Figure 3A). A comparison of the structures reveals an overall 1–2 Å binding pocket compaction with inward shift of helices V, VI, and VII around the ergoline moiety of ERG (Figure 1B, top panel). Such compaction of the binding pocket is expected for ergolines and the endogenous agonist 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (Wang et al., 2013Wang C. Jiang Y. Ma J. Wu H. Wacker D. Katritch V. Han G.W. Liu W. Huang X.P. Vardy E. et al.Structural basis for molecular recognition at serotonin receptors.Science. 2013; 340: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), both of which are less bulky than the 4-(diphenylmethylene)-piperidine core of the inverse agonist RIT. These helix movements are accompanied by rotamer switches in the conserved P5.50-I3.40-F6.44 (P-I-F) motif and a shift of the W3246.48 “toggle switch” in helix VI (Figure 3B), representative of active-state-like structures at biogenic amine and other GPCRs (Venkatakrishnan et al., 2013Venkatakrishnan A.J. Deupi X. Lebon G. Tate C.G. Schertler G.F. Babu M.M.

As mentioned above, the inverse agonist RIT binds deeper than most class A GPCR ligands in the TM helical bundle where one of its 4-fluorophenyl groups forms tight interaction with W3246.48, I1423.40, and F3206.44 side chains thus apparently preventing the conformational changes in these key activation microswitches. Furthermore, the 4-fluorophenyl group of RIT is in close proximity to I1423.40 apparently facilitating an outward shift of the intracellular end of helix III (Figure 1B, bottom panel), which potentially explains the inverse agonist activity of RIT at this receptor isoform. To test this hypothesis, functional studies were performed with mutants of these key microswitch residues in 5-HT2C measuring Gαq activation and β-arrestin2 recruitment. Mutations of the “toggle switch” W3246.48 and F3206.44, which are part of the P-I-F trigger motif, selectively abolish RIT’s Gαq inverse agonism without affecting RIT’s β-arrestin2 inverse agonist activity (Figure 3C) indicating that these microswitch residues are mainly involved in the Gαq activation process. Furthermore, the I142A3.40 mutation of the P-I-F motif also selectively abolishes RIT’s Gαq inverse agonism and the I142F3.40 mutant transforms RIT into a Gαq partial agonist with little agonist effect on arrestin recruitment (Figure 3C). This mutant I142F3.40 likely imparts additional aromatic stacking properties to RIT, indicating that the P-I-F motif is important for RIT’s inverse agonist profile (Figure 3C). These results support a model whereby the 4-fluorophenyl moiety of RIT stabilizes an inactive state of the receptor via interference with the “toggle switch” W6.48 and “trigger motif” P5.50-I3.40-F6.44 and that these microswitch residues are critical for inverse agonist activity and the Gαq activation process, in general, at the 5-HT2C. To illuminate ERG’s polypharmacology, we first assessed its binding affinity across the aminergic receptor"
https://openalex.org/W2786283343,"Nrf1-mediated proteosome activity in brown fat is required for the normal thermogenic behavior of this tissue in mice. Adipocytes possess remarkable adaptive capacity to respond to nutrient excess, fasting or cold exposure, and they are thus an important cell type for the maintenance of proper metabolic health. Although the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a critical organelle for cellular homeostasis, the mechanisms that mediate adaptation of the ER to metabolic challenges in adipocytes are unclear. Here we show that brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic function requires an adaptive increase in proteasomal activity to secure cellular protein quality control, and we identify the ER-localized transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2–like 1 (Nfe2l1, also known as Nrf1) as a critical driver of this process. We show that cold adaptation induces Nrf1 in BAT to increase proteasomal activity and that this is crucial for maintaining ER homeostasis and cellular integrity, specifically when the cells are in a state of high thermogenic activity. In mice, under thermogenic conditions, brown-adipocyte-specific deletion of Nfe2l1 (Nrf1) resulted in ER stress, tissue inflammation, markedly diminished mitochondrial function and whitening of the BAT. In mouse models of both genetic and dietary obesity, stimulation of proteasomal activity by exogenously expressing Nrf1 or by treatment with the proteasome activator PA28α in BAT resulted in improved insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, Nrf1 emerges as a novel guardian of brown adipocyte function, providing increased proteometabolic quality control for adapting to cold or to obesity."

Hence, dopamine secretion is mediated by sparse, mechanistically specialized active zone-like release sites. This architecture supports spatially and temporally precise coding for dopamine and provides molecular machinery for regulation. In the brain, two principle modes of chemical transmission support neuronal communication. In fast synaptic transmission, a presynaptic terminal rapidly and precisely signals to a postsynaptic partner. This contrasts with volume transmission, where neuromodulators diffuse to mediate effects in many cells over a large area (Agnati et al., 1995Agnati L.F. Zoli M. Strömberg I. Fuxe K. Intercellular communication in the brain: wiring versus volume transmission.Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 711-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). For fast neurotransmitters, sub-millisecond timing of release is mediated by precisely assembled protein networks called active zones. Active zones are composed of scaffolding proteins that are attached to the presynaptic plasma membrane opposed to postsynaptic receptors. The active zone docks synaptic vesicles, enhances release probability, aligns fusion with postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors, and mediates presynaptic plasticity (Südhof, 2012Südhof T.C. The presynaptic active zone.Neuron. 2012; 75: 11-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Vertebrate active zones contain bassoon/piccolo, RIM, and ELKS as key scaffolds, Munc13s for vesicle priming, and RIM-BPs to support RIM in the tight coupling of docked vesicles to Ca2+ channels (Acuna et al., 2015Acuna C.

The nature of volume transmission indicates that precise localization and timing of secretion are not necessary for this signaling mode. Thus, whether volume transmission employs similar active zone machinery for release is an open question. The midbrain dopamine system is an important neuromodulatory network, with cell bodies residing in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Axons from these dopamine neurons project to the striatum, where dopamine regulates circuits for movement, motivation, and reward (Howe and Dombeck, 2016Howe M.W. Dombeck D.A.

Dopaminergic modulation of striatal networks in health and Parkinson’s disease.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 29: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the striatum, dopamine receptors are mostly localized outside of synapses (Caillé et al., 1996Caillé I. Dumartin B. Bloch B.

Watkins K.C. Garcia S. Bosler O. Doucet G.

Neurol. 1996; 375: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and dopamine receptors are G-protein coupled, whose signaling is more than two orders of magnitude slower than that of ionotropic receptors (Missale et al., 1998Missale C. Nash S.R.S. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Dopamine receptors: from structure to function.Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar). These properties have led to the conclusion that dopamine is a volume transmitter that signals slowly and inaccurately, and suggests that an active zone that warrants speed and accuracy may be unnecessary for dopamine release. Striatal dopamine release is often subdivided into tonic and phasic modes, which are both triggered by action potentials. Tonic release generates a mild, widespread increase in extracellular dopamine through non-synchronous spontaneous firing of some dopamine neurons, while phasic release results in a fast and transient dopamine increase due to synchronized burst firing (Grace, 2016Grace A.A. Dysregulation of the dopamine system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and depression.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Phasic release may support fast and spatially localized dopamine signaling (Floresco et al., 2003Floresco S.B. West A.R. Ash B. Moore H. Grace A.A.

Phasic dopamine release drives rapid activation of striatal D2-receptors.Neuron. 2014; 84: 164-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and recent studies supported a sub-second time window for dopamine coding (Howe and Dombeck, 2016Howe M.W. Dombeck D.A. Rapid signalling in distinct dopaminergic axons during locomotion and reward.Nature. 2016; 535: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, Yagishita et al., 2014Yagishita S.

A critical time window for dopamine actions on the structural plasticity of dendritic spines.Science. 2014; 345: 1616-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus, functional studies suggest that at least some dopamine signaling is rapid. Here, we examined whether there are specialized release sites that support dopamine secretion for fast signaling. We tested for three defining properties of active zones in axonal arbors of midbrain dopamine neurons in the striatum. First, we determined whether dopamine axons contained active zone protein scaffolds. Using super resolution microscopy, we found protein assemblies consisting of bassoon, RIM, and ELKS in ∼30% of dopamine varicosities. Second, we assessed whether these proteins participated in dopamine release. We generated dopamine neuron-specific knockout mice and found that RIM deletion abolished dopamine release, and the loss of release was accompanied by a disruption of the active zone scaffolds. Remarkably, ELKS was dispensable for striatal dopamine release, suggesting mechanistic specialization of the dopamine release machinery. Third, we tested the functional properties of dopamine release using optogenetics and found that dopamine release was fast and had a very high initial release probability, strongly indicating the necessity of active zone-like sites. Thus, striatal dopamine release is mediated by sparse release hotspots in dopamine axons to generate a precisely localized dopamine signal with rapid kinetics. At fast synapses, active zones are identified by the presence of the molecular scaffold bassoon (Altrock et al., 2003Altrock W.D. tom Dieck S. Sokolov M. Meyer A.C. Sigler A. Brakebusch C. Fässler R. Richter K. Boeckers T.M.

Fusion Competent Synaptic Vesicles Persist upon Active Zone Disruption and Loss of Vesicle Docking.Neuron. 2016; 91: 777-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To investigate whether dopamine neurons contain similar release sites, we tested whether bassoon clusters are present in dopamine axons in the striatum. We labeled dopamine axons with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibodies and co-stained with antibodies against bassoon in sections of the dorsal striatum. Because the striatum contains synapses at a very high density and dopamine axons account only for a small fraction of the striatum, it is not possible to determine whether a given bassoon cluster is within a dopamine axon by diffraction-limited or two-dimensional microscopy. We therefore employed three-dimensional structured illumination super resolution microscopy (3D-SIM) (Figures 1 and S1; Movie S1), which enhanced resolution in all three dimensions (Gustafsson et al., 2008Gustafsson M.G.L. Shao L. Carlton P.M. Wang C.J.R. Golubovskaya I.N. Cande W.Z. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Three-dimensional resolution doubling in wide-field fluorescence microscopy by structured illumination.Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 4957-4970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). To analyze the 3D-SIM images, we calculated the overlap between bassoon clusters and dopamine axons in 3D reconstructions (Figure 1B). Bassoon clusters for which more than 40% of the volume overlapped with TH-labeling were considered to be within dopamine axons (Figures 1B and S1A). The detected bassoon clusters could reflect bassoon within dopamine axons, or they could be detection artifacts due to the high density of nearby synapses that contain bassoon. To distinguish between these possibilities, we locally shuffled the position of each bassoon cluster within a 1 μm3 cube and calculated how much random overlap this generated with TH-positive axons (Figures 1B–1E). If the association of bassoon and TH was an artifact, bassoon density and size should be similar before and after shuffling. In contrast, we found that in every image, bassoon cluster density within dopamine axons decreased and the cluster size increased upon shuffling (Figures 1D and 1E). This indicates that there are bassoon clusters within dopamine axons and that they are smaller than the ones outside.Figure S1Histogram of Bassoon Clusters within Dopamine Axons and Characterization of Striatal Synaptosomes, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Histogram of actual and locally shuffled bassoon cluster densities within dopamine axons across 20% bins of overlap. n = 35 regions/4 mice.

To assess bassoon localization in dopamine axons with an independent method, we prepared synaptosomes from the striatum (Figures 1F and S1B–S1E), labeled them with antibodies against bassoon, TH, and the vesicular SNARE protein synaptobrevin-2, and imaged them using stimulated emission depletion (STED) super resolution microscopy (Figure 1G). In TH-positive and in TH-negative synaptosomes, bassoon labeling coincided with synaptobrevin-2 positive vesicles, and the bassoon labeling often aligned with the edge of the synaptobrevin signal. This independently establishes that dopamine axons contain vesicle clusters that are associated with bassoon. The average area of bassoon clusters in TH-positive synaptosomes was 24.2% smaller than that in TH-negative synaptosomes (Figure 1H), confirming that bassoon clusters within dopamine axons are smaller than the average striatal bassoon clusters. We next tested whether dopamine axons contain RIM and ELKS (Figure 2), two important redundant scaffolds for active zone assembly at fast synapses (Wang et al., 2016Wang S.S.H. Held R.G. Wong M.Y.

While it is desirable to measure absolute cluster densities in dopamine axons, this is not possible through subtraction with the shuffling method. Shuffling only provides an estimate of the maximum influence of artifactual overlap, but not the real false-positive rate in the actual analysis. For RIM and ELKS, we were able to address this limitation by conditional gene knockout. We removed RIM (RIM cKODA) or ELKS (ELKS cKODA) specifically from dopamine neurons by crossing mice with floxed alleles for Rims1 and 2 (Kaeser et al., 2011Kaeser P.S. Deng L. Wang Y. Dulubova I.

We then compared cluster densities within dopamine axons in RIM cKODA and ELKS cKODA mice with corresponding sibling control mice. We found that RIM and ELKS were clustered in dopamine axons of control mice, and conditional knockout reduced cluster densities progressively with increasing volume overlap with TH (Figures 2A–2D), an effect that was not present after shuffling (Figures S2 and S3). The clusters detected after knockout are a combination of background staining (∼25% in immunofluorescent stainings with the antibodies used here) (Wang et al., 2016Wang S.S.H. Held R.G. Wong M.Y.

We calculated the absolute density of RIM and ELKS clusters to be 0.31 and 0.22 per μm of axon (Figures 2B and 2D), respectively, after subtracting all signal (>0% volume overlap) in RIM and ELKS cKODA mice from corresponding control mice.Figure S23D-SIM Analyses of RIM Clusters within Dopamine Axons, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Schematic of the conditional RIM knockout in dopamine neurons (RIM cKODA).

Animals in nature typically lack the luxury of eating readily available food at their pleasure. Before feeding, many predators perform a predatory action sequence that includes searching, pursuing, attacking, and consuming (Comoli et al., 2005Comoli E. Ribeiro-Barbosa E.R. Negrão N. Goto M. Canteras N.S. Functional mapping of the prosencephalic systems involved in organizing predatory behavior in rats.Neuroscience. 2005; 130: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Conversely, the prey seeks to evade the predator. Although numerous studies have provided insights into the neural mechanisms underlying feeding behaviors (Morton et al., 2006Morton G.J. Cummings D.E. Baskin D.G. Barsh G.S. Schwartz M.W. Central nervous system control of food intake and body weight.Nature. 2006; 443: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar, Sternson, 2013Sternson S.M.

Wise R.A. Lateral hypothalamic circuits for feeding and reward.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), it has been challenging to define the neural circuits for predation. Classical electrical stimulations revealed various hotspots for “quiet biting attack,” including the thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (Bandler et al., 1972Bandler Jr., R.J.

Viewed together, these early studies suggested that there may be a “predatory attack center” in the brain that coordinates how these multiple brain areas drive predation behavior. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is a possible candidate for this hypothetical predatory attack center. It connects the ventral tegmental area and the PAG via the medial forebrain bundle (Berthoud and Münzberg, 2011Berthoud H.-R. Münzberg H.

The LH receives axon projections from multiple nuclei, including the feeding-related arcuate nucleus, the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, and the recently identified predatory hotspot in the central amygdala (CeA) that is involved in processing sensorimotor information during predation (Berk and Finkelstein, 1981Berk M.L.

Because electrical microstimulation can activate local neuron somata as well as the pass-by axons of neurons from other brain regions, the precise LH neural circuits underlying predation remain to be dissected precisely. Hypothalamic regions, especially those in the medial aspect, are also involved in evasion behavior (Lammers et al., 1988Lammers J.H. Kruk M.R. Meelis W. van der Poel A.M.

Pott C.B. Neural substrates of aggression and flight in the cat.Prog. Neurobiol. 1988; 31: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), although the role of the LH in evasion remains largely unknown. The LH contains many genetically distinct cell populations (Berthoud and Münzberg, 2011Berthoud H.-R. Münzberg H.

Using both projection-specific and cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulation, as well as fiber photometry recording, we here show that PAG-projecting LH GABA neurons drive predatory attack upon natural and artificial prey and demonstrate that inhibiting these neurons blocks predatory behavior. Furthermore, we show that PAG-projecting LH glutamate neurons control evasion behavior and demonstrate that inhibiting these neurons impairs the ability to escape from danger. Using a dual-virus strategy that selectively expresses genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6m in a projection-specific manner (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R.

After we trained food-deprived mice to hunt crickets, they typically completed the searching, pursuit, and attack actions of the sequence in less than 2 s but spent a long time consuming the prey (∼60 s). Aligning the GCaMP signals with video-scored behavioral actions revealed an increase in the activity of PAG-projecting LH neurons starting when starving mice began to hunt crickets (Figure 1C). These results implicated PAG-projecting LH neurons in predatory behavior. To test whether or not activating PAG-projecting LH neurons would induce predatory attack behavior, we expressed ChR2-mCherry in the PAG-projecting LH neurons using the dual-virus strategy (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1A) (Boyden et al., 2005Boyden E.S.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in brain slices confirmed that brief light pulses reliably evoked spike firing from ChR2-mCherry-expressing neurons in the LH (Figure S1B). In order to assay stimulation-evoked predatory behavior, we used cricket-naive mice that had free access to food and water (Figure 1F). Light pulses were delivered through an optical fiber implanted into the LH (Figure S1C). Without optogenetic stimulation, the nonhungry cricket-naive mice rarely initiated predatory attack against crickets. Immediately following optogenetic stimulation, mice initiated predatory attack, sniffing vigorously around the test chamber, rushing toward a cricket and subduing it with their forepaws, and eventually delivering repeated killing bites with a 91.7% probability (Figures 1G–1I; Movie S1). The stimulated mice did not eat up these crickets within the 30-s stimulation period; rather, they attacked a cricket and left most of its dead body in the chamber (Figure 1G). As each new round of optogenetic stimulation was delivered, the stimulated mouse would initiate a new predatory attack sequence. The mean attack latency between stimulation and attack (the time from stimulation onset to mouse contact with a cricket) was less than 10 s (Figure S1D). The predatory attack behavior ceased immediately when the light pulses were stopped (Figure 1H; Movie S1, first part). Thus, PAG-projecting neurons in the LH are sufficient to rapidly orchestrate predatory attack without prior training. The LH neurons labeled with the two-virus strategy projected their axonal terminals in the lateral and ventral lateral region of the PAG (l/vlPAG) (Figure 1J). Photostimulating the axonal terminals in the PAG produced similarly strong predatory behavior with similarly short latency (Figures 1K and S1E). In patch-clamp recordings of brain slices, stimulating the axonal terminals from retrograde-labeled LH neurons evoked a mixture of GABAergic inhibitory currents and glutamatergic excitatory currents in PAG neurons, indicating that these PAG-projecting LH neurons can release the neurotransmitters GABA and/or glutamate (Figures 1L and 1M). Anatomical analysis of the PAG-projecting LH neurons of sacrificed mice revealed that about 61% were putatively GABAergic (vesicular GABA transporter-positive; Vgat+) and that about 33% are glutamatergic (vesicular glutamate transporter 2-positive; Vglut2+; Figures S1F–S1I). PAG-projecting LH neurons also project to other brain regions such as the thalamus and the lateral habenular (LHb), and project along the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) to the midbrain ventral tegmental area and the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) as well as the reticular nucleus posterior to the PAG (Figure S1J). Unilateral activating the thalamus projection, the LHb projection, and the reticular projection produced no obvious effects on predatory attack in the cricket-hunting task (Figures S1K, S1L, and S1N). Activating the ventral tegmental area/SNc projection located between the LH and the PAG induced attack behavior similar to what we observed with PAG activation (Figure S1M). However, it is possible that this predatory attack behavior could be caused by some coactivation of PAG-projecting pass-by fibers in the ventral tegmental area/SNc. Our results suggest that PAG-projecting LH neurons may coordinate neuronal activity in multiple brain regions as they orchestrate predatory behavior. Next, we specifically tested whether the activity of LH GABA neurons encodes particular aspects of the predatory attack behavior sequence. To monitor the activity of the inhibitory projections during predatory attack, we targeted GABA neurons by stereotaxic infusion of AAV-DIO-GCaMP6m vectors into the LH of Vgat-Cre mice (Figure 2A). Using fiber photometry, we measured changes in the GCaMP6 fluorescence of LH GABA neurons during the starvation-induced cricket-hunting task (Figure 2A). Aligning the GCaMP signals with video-scored behavioral actions revealed that neuronal activity increased at the moment that animals started hunting crickets; neuronal activity fell back to the baseline level as the mouse consumed the cricket (Figures 2B–2D and S2A–S2D; Movie S2). We did not detect significant changes in fluorescence signals in LH GABA neurons of GFP-expressing control mice during the cricket-hunting experiments, confirming that the GCaMP signals genuinely indicate neuronal activity and are not simply reflecting artifacts of motion (Figures S2E and S2F). In order to more precisely control the timing of predatory attack behaviors, we designed a computer-controlled food-chasing task. We used real-time monitoring and computer-controlled robotic arms to guide the movement of the food dish via remote magnetic force. After a mouse entered the specified trigger zone in an arena for 1 s, a moving dish that contained food pellets (artificial prey) was guided along one of two edges of the chamber (Figure 2E). When a mouse ran after the dish and came within 10 cm of the dish, the dish was stopped so that the mouse could retrieve one small food pellet. After training, mice showed predation-like behavior toward the moving food dish (Figures 2F and S2G). Following triggering of dish entry into the arena (“initiation” stage), animals quickly chased after the moving artificial prey dish (“chasing” stage), typically completing a “virtual predation sequence” within 2 s (Figures 2G, S2H, and S2I). Fiber photometry revealed that the activity of LH GABA neurons ramped up during pursuit and reached peak activity during pellet retrieval (“retrieval” stage) (Figures 2H–2J). It should be noted that our fiber photometry reflects the population-level activity of LH GABA neurons. Previous monitoring at single-cell resolution revealed that LH GABA neurons encode either the appetitive or consummatory aspects of reward-related behaviors (Jennings et al., 2015Jennings J.H. Ung R.L. Resendez S.L. Stamatakis A.M. Taylor J.G. Huang J. Veleta K. Kantak P.A. Aita M. Shilling-Scrivo K. et al.Visualizing hypothalamic network dynamics for appetitive and consummatory behaviors.Cell. 2015; 160: 516-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), but it had remained unclear how LH GABA neurons change their activity during hunting. To test whether the endogenous activity of LH GABA neurons is necessary for predation, we used viral-vector mediated, Cre-dependent expression of the Guillardia theta anion channel rhodopsin 1 protein (GtACR1) (Govorunova et al., 2015Govorunova E.G. Sineshchekov O.A. Janz R. Liu X. Spudich J.L. NEUROSCIENCE. Natural light-gated anion channels: A family of microbial rhodopsins for advanced optogenetics.Science. 2015; 349: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) to optically inhibit GABA neurons in the bilateral LH (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). In these cricket-hunting experiments, optogenetic inhibition abolished mouse predation on crickets (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3B). In separate food-chasing tasks (Figure S3C), optogenetic inhibition of LH GABA neurons during the initiation stage prevented mice from chasing the moving food dish (Figures 3E–3G and S3D–S3F; Movie S3). However, inhibition applied immediately after pellet retrieval did not disrupt an animal’s gnawing (putatively consummatory) behavior (Figures 3H, S3G, and S3H). Thus, the activity of LH GABA neurons is essential for initiating and actually conducting predatory attack, but not for the consumption of successfully captured food. To determine the role of the LH GABA neurons in predatory attack, we expressed ChR2 in LH GABA neurons by stereotaxic infusion of AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry vectors into the LH of Vgat-Cre mice (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4A). Following the expression of ChR2-mCherry in LH GABA neurons, optogenetic stimulation of the ChR2-expressing axonal terminals elicited GABAergic currents in PAG neurons in a brain slice preparation (Figures 4C and 4D). Applying light pulses into the LH rapidly drove strong predatory attack from the ChR2-expressing mice but not from the mGFP-expressing control mice (Figures 4E and S4B; Movie S1, latter part). Stimulation of LH GABA neurons also caused mice to initiate chasing, neck stretching, and biting upon another mouse, albeit with only about half of the attack percentage as for cricket attack (Figures S4C and S4D; Movie S4, first part). The attacks against other mice exhibited typical features of intraspecific predatory attack and differed from defensive attacks, which are characterized by piloerection and back arching (Lin et al., 2011Lin D. Boyle M.P. Dollar P. Lee H. Lein E.S. Perona P. Anderson D.J. Functional identification of an aggression locus in the mouse hypothalamus.Nature. 2011; 470: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, Siegel et al., 1999Siegel A. Roeling T.A. Gregg T.R. Kruk M.R. Neuropharmacology of brain-stimulation-evoked aggression.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1999; 23: 359-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Therefore, LH GABA neurons in mice can produce a sufficiently strong motivation to drive attack against both crickets and intraspecific targets. To test whether the promise of obtaining some caloric value is required for the observed light-evoked predatory attack, we designed an artificial prey object that offered no caloric content by embedding a small magnet in a wax disk, which was controlled by remote magnetic force (similar to the food dish, above). To mimic a natural prey item, the artificial prey was moved away as a mouse approached (Figure 4F). Optogenetic stimulation of LH GABA neurons caused the mice to pursue, attack, and voraciously bite the artificial prey disk (Figures 4G, S4E, and S4F; Movie S4, latter part). A substantial amount of wax had been bitten off the disk by the end of the trial sessions (Figure 4G), suggesting that activating LH GABA neurons can compel vigorous chasing and strong biting attack against a moving object without any caloric value. To determine whether LH GABA neurons have the potential of switching from evasion to predation, we conducted experiments in which we turned the wax disk into an attacker by guiding it to repetitively strike a mouse. Mice would turn and run away to escape from these strikes in typical evasion behavior (Figures 4H and S4G). However, immediately following stimulation of LH GABA neurons, a mouse would stop running away from disk strikes, instead turning its body around and starting to attack and bite the disk (Figures 4I–4K and S4G–S4K; Movie S5), demonstrating that stimulating LH GABA neurons can produce a sufficiently strong attack drive to switch behavior from evasion to predation. We carried out several additional experiments to study the role of LH GABA neurons that project specifically to the PAG. First, we carried out optogenetic inhibition specifically in the PAG-projecting LH GABA neurons and their terminals in the PAG during the cricket-hunting task and the food-chasing task. Using the dual-virus strategy, we injected retrogradely transported and Cre-recombinase-dependent AAV-retro-DIO-Flp into the PAG and injected Flp-dependent AAV-fDIO-GtACR1 into the LH of Vgat-Cre mice (Figure 5A). Optogenetic inhibition of both the PAG-projecting LH GABA neurons and their terminals in the PAG significantly suppressed predatory behavior in the cricket-hunting task (Figure 5B). Moreover, optogenetic inhibition of PAG-projecting LH GABA neurons starting from the initiation of food chasing decreased the successful hit rate during the food-chasing task (Figure 5C) but does not affect an animal’s gnawing behavior when such inhibition is started after the animal has begun to consume the food pellet (Figure 5D). These results indicate that the activity of PAG-projecting LH GABA neurons is necessary for predatory behavior. We then characterized the behavioral effect of activating LH GABA neurons that projected to the PAG. We expressed ChR2 in LH GABA neurons by single injection of AAV-DIO-ChR2 into the LH of Vgat-Cre mice. Stimulation of the axonal terminals in the l/vlPAG from LH GABA neurons also produced strong predatory attacks against crickets, intraspecific individuals, and artificial prey (Figures 5E, 5F, and S5A–S5E). We also expressed ChR2 in PAG-projecting LH GABA neurons using the dual-virus strategy of injecting AAV-retro-DIO-Flp vectors into the PAG and Flp-recombinase-dependent AAV-fDIO-ChR2-EYFP vectors into the LH of Vgat-Cre mice (Figure 5G). Optogenetic stimulation of the PAG-projecting LH GABA neurons resulted in attack against crickets, with an attack probability of over 92.5%, and latency of less than 10 s (Figures 5H and S5F–S5I). We observed no attack behavior while stimulating the LH of control mice that had received AAV-fDIO-ChR2-EYFP injection into the LH but no injection of AAV-retro-DIO-Flp into"

Tau pathology is associated with more than 20 neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (Wang and Mandelkow, 2016Wang Y. Mandelkow E. Tau in physiology and pathology.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 5-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation or mutation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau is common to all of these diseases, collectively termed Tauopathies, and filamentous inclusions of hyperphosphorylated Tau are hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer’s disease and other Tauopathies (Ballatore et al., 2007Ballatore C. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Tau-mediated neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Tau pathology is not merely a by-product of other pathological pathways, but it is a key mediator of neurotoxicity itself. In mouse models of familial Alzheimer’s disease modeling excessive β-amyloid production, reduction of endogenous Tau ameliorates neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits (Roberson et al., 2007Roberson E.D. Scearce-Levie K. Palop J.J. Yan F. Cheng I.H. Wu T. Gerstein H. Yu G.-Q. Mucke L.

Moreover, mutations in the Tau-encoding MAPT locus are causative of frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) (Hutton et al., 1998Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P.

In physiological conditions, Tau is expressed in neurons and is bound to axonal microtubules. In pathological conditions, however, mutations in Tau (in FTDP-17) or abnormal phosphorylation of Tau (including in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease) decrease its microtubule-binding affinity (Hong et al., 1998Hong M.

These findings highlight a key role of soluble (monomeric or oligomeric) Tau in perturbing synaptic function in early disease stages, which likely contributes to subsequent synapse loss and neurodegeneration. While growing evidence has implicated soluble Tau dysfunction in causing neurotoxicity, less understood are the precise mechanisms by which Tau impairs neuronal function. Previous work has elucidated functions of pathological Tau in contributing to postsynaptic dysfunction on account of its mislocalization to dendritic spines and interference with glutamate receptor organization (Hoover et al., 2010Hoover B.R.

However, in addition to its postsynaptic localization, pathological Tau is also present in presynaptic compartments (Tai et al., 2012Tai H.-C. Serrano-Pozo A. Hashimoto T. Frosch M.P.

Commun. 2017; 8: 15295Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), suggesting that Tau function at the presynapse may also contribute to disease pathogenesis. A presynaptic function of Tau is also pertinent given that neurodegeneration is thought to begin with the loss of presynaptic terminals and proceed retrogradely in a dying-back process (Yoshiyama et al., 2007Yoshiyama Y. Higuchi M. Zhang B. Huang S.-M. Iwata N. Saido T.C. Maeda J. Suhara T. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y.

Moreover, in fly and rat neurons, Tau can interfere with neurotransmitter release by associating with synaptic vesicles at presynaptic terminals (Zhou et al., 2017Zhou L. McInnes J. Wierda K. Holt M.

Commun. 2017; 8: 15295Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest a critical role for synapse-localized Tau in contributing to neurotoxicity in early disease stages. In this work, we show that pathological, hyperphosphorylated Tau species accumulate on presynaptic vesicles isolated from Alzheimer’s disease patient brains, suggesting this pathway contributes to synaptic dysfunction in human disease. Using unbiased proteomic and genetic approaches, we find that the transmembrane synaptic vesicle protein Synaptogyrin-3 mediates the association of Tau with synaptic vesicles in vitro and in vivo. Reduction of Drosophila Synaptogyrin or murine Synaptogyrin-3 levels in neurons of fly and mouse models of Tauopathy reduces the association of Tau with synaptic vesicles, and, subsequently, it rescues Tau-induced defects in vesicle mobility and neurotransmitter release. Our findings identify Synaptogyrin-3 as a novel Tau interactor that mediates Tau-induced synaptic dysfunction, providing important insights into Tau biology and opening new avenues for specifically targeting early presynaptic dysfunction in Tauopathies. We and others previously described the localization of pathological hyperphosphorylated Tau to presynaptic terminals of Alzheimer’s disease patient brains (Tai et al., 2012Tai H.-C. Serrano-Pozo A.

Miskiewicz K. et al.Tau association with synaptic vesicles causes presynaptic dysfunction.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15295Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and our recent work demonstrated that presynaptically localized Tau binds to fly and rodent synaptic vesicles (SVs) via its N-terminal domain (Zhou et al., 2017Zhou L. McInnes J. Wierda K. Holt M. Herrmann A.G. Jackson R.J. Wang Y.-C. Swerts J. Beyens J. Miskiewicz K. et al.Tau association with synaptic vesicles causes presynaptic dysfunction.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15295Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To assess the possible relevance of Tau association with SVs in human disease, we biochemically fractionated post-mortem brain tissue from Alzheimer’s disease patients or non-demented control subjects to isolate SVs (Figures S1A and S1B). Examining a cohort of 15 patients (Table S1), we observed enrichment of hyperphosphorylated Tau species in the SV fractions from Alzheimer’s disease patient brains using antibodies recognizing disease-associated phospho-Tau epitopes (AT8 and PHF-1) or total Tau (DAKO) (Figure 1; Figure S1C). We also detected some native Tau on SVs from healthy control subjects, but this amount was on average 2- to 3-fold increased on SVs from Alzheimer’s patient brain (Figure 1B; see also Discussion). Furthermore, Tau on SVs from Alzheimer’s disease brain was predominantly hyperphosphorylated and oligomeric species, which are known to be highly toxic in the brain (Wang and Mandelkow, 2016Wang Y. Mandelkow E. Tau in physiology and pathology.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 5-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The amount of Tau on SVs was correlated with the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, but not age or gender (Figures S1D and S1E). These data suggest the association of pathological Tau species with SVs in Alzheimer’s disease, warranting further exploration of this pathway as a potential contributor to Tau-induced synaptic dysfunction in human disease. We first determined the binding mechanism of Tau to SVs in order to identify new targets to disrupt this interaction. SVs are comprised of the vesicle membrane, integral transmembrane SV proteins, and peripheral SV-associated proteins (Takamori et al., 2006Takamori S. Holt M. Stenius K. Lemke E.A. Grønborg M. Riedel D. Urlaub H. Schenck S. Brügger B. Ringler P. et al.Molecular anatomy of a trafficking organelle.Cell. 2006; 127: 831-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). We first assessed whether protein-protein interactions or membrane lipid interactions mediate the association of Tau with SVs. We isolated SVs from mouse brain (Figures S2A and S2B), and we performed limited proteolysis by incubation with trypsin, which degrades all peripheral SV-associated proteins and the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane SV proteins but leaves the membrane lipid bilayer intact (Figures 2A and 2B ). We then incubated untreated or trypsinized SVs with recombinant human Tau purified from bacteria (Figures S2C and S2D). Following incubation with Tau, SVs were pelleted by ultracentrifugation, and the binding of Tau to SVs was assessed by immunoblotting for Tau in the SV pellet. The co-sedimentation assay accurately reflects direct Tau binding to SVs and is not influenced by Tau aggregation (Zhou et al., 2017Zhou L. McInnes J. Wierda K. Holt M. Herrmann A.G. Jackson R.J. Wang Y.-C. Swerts J. Beyens J. Miskiewicz K. et al.Tau association with synaptic vesicles causes presynaptic dysfunction.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15295Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the co-sedimentation assay, Tau bound to untreated SVs, but this binding was largely lost upon proteolysis of SV proteins (Figures 2C and 2D), indicating that SV proteins are required for Tau binding to SVs. Following sedimentation, the amount of Tau in the supernatants was similar, showing that there is no residual trypsin activity following proteolysis of SVs (Figure S2E). In agreement, we also did not detect Tau binding to synthetic protein-free liposomes, which were similar in size and lipid composition to SVs (Figure S2F). Thus, protein-protein interactions underlie the binding of Tau to SVs. To further delineate whether Tau binds to SVs via interaction with transmembrane SV proteins or peripheral SV-associated proteins, we performed carbonate stripping of SVs. This manipulation removes peripheral SV-associated proteins but leaves transmembrane SV proteins intact (Figure 2E). When introduced into the co-sedimentation assay, Tau bound equally well to untreated and carbonate-stripped SVs (Figures 2F and 2G), indicating that peripheral SV-associated proteins are dispensable for binding. Together, these data indicate that Tau binds to SVs via interaction with transmembrane SV proteins. We then utilized an unbiased proteomics approach to identify the transmembrane SV proteins that bind Tau (Figure 3A). We performed high-detergent lysis of isolated SVs to solubilize SV proteins, and we performed a co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) reaction using purified recombinant TauFL-His or TauΔN-His as bait (Figures S2C and S2D), followed by mass spectrometry analysis to identify bound proteins. The N-terminal domain of Tau is required for binding to SVs (Zhou et al., 2017Zhou L. McInnes J. Wierda K. Holt M. Herrmann A.G. Jackson R.J. Wang Y.-C. Swerts J. Beyens J. Miskiewicz K. et al.Tau association with synaptic vesicles causes presynaptic dysfunction.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15295Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and thus the interactor of Tau on SVs should bind full-length Tau (TauFL), but not N-terminally truncated Tau (TauΔN). Using this approach, we identified 8 SV proteins as potential interactors of Tau (Figure 3B; Table S2), but only one protein is both transmembrane and specific to the N terminus of Tau: Synaptogyrin-3 (Syngr3). Syngr3 is an SV-specific protein of unknown function that has four transmembrane domains with cytoplasmic exposed N- and C-terminal tails (Kedra et al., 1998Kedra D. Pan H.Q. Seroussi E. Fransson I. Guilbaud C. Collins J.E. Dunham I. Blennow E. Roe B.A. Piehl F. Dumanski J.P. Characterization of the human synaptogyrin gene family.Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Syngr3 is the only candidate that fits our criteria as a potential interactor of Tau in vitro; nevertheless, we tested whether Drosophila homologs of any of the 8 SV proteins identified in our proteomics approach show a genetic interaction with Tau in vivo. For this, we crossed flies expressing FTDP-17 clinical mutant TauP301L to loss-of-function alleles or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs for the Drosophila homologs of these 8 candidate interactors, and we measured colocalization of Tau with SVs as a readout of Tau-SV association in vivo (Figures 3C and 3D). In third-instar Drosophila larvae expressing human Tau carrying FTDP-17 clinical mutations (P301L, V337M, or R406W) in motor neurons, mutant Tau dissociated from axonal microtubules and relocalized to presynaptic boutons at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). At boutons, Tau colocalized with SVs that organized in a ring-like pattern in the periphery of the bouton (Figures 4A and 4B ), which was quantified using the Pearson co-localization coefficient between Tau and SVs immunolabeled with anti-Cysteine String Protein (CSP) antibodies. We found that TauP301L showed a diffuse pattern when we lowered the expression level of Synaptogyrin (Syngr, the single Drosophila homolog of Syngr3; Stevens et al., 2012Stevens R.J. Akbergenova Y. Jorquera R.A. Littleton J.T. Abnormal synaptic vesicle biogenesis in Drosophila synaptogyrin mutants.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 18054-18067, 18067aCrossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but not any other candidate interactor (Figures 3D, 4A, and 4B). Similarly, two other pathogenic FTDP-17 Tau mutants also showed diffuse localization at boutons when Syngr expression was lowered (Figure 4C). Both heterozygous loss (50% reduction) and shRNA-mediated knockdown (90% reduction; Figures S3A and S3B) of Syngr were effective to cause dissociation of Tau from SVs to a similar extent as genetically deleting the N-terminal SV binding domain of Tau (expression of TauΔN) (Figures 3D and 4A–4C), indicating that partial loss of Syngr is sufficient to reduce Tau-SV binding in vivo at Drosophila NMJs. To test if Syngr is required for the direct physical interaction of Tau with SVs, we isolated SVs from wild-type (WT) or syngr knockout (KO) adult fly brains (Figures S3C and S3D). In the co-sedimentation assay, recombinant human Tau bound to wild-type SVs, but binding to syngr KO SVs was severely reduced (Figures 4D and 4E). These results complement our findings at NMJs in vivo, where the reduction of Syngr caused the diffuse localization of pathogenic Tau (Figures 4A–4C). Taken together, these data indicate that the physical interaction between Tau and Syngr is the principle mechanism underlying the binding of Tau to SVs. When Tau binds to SVs, they become crosslinked and less mobile, causing defects in the recruitment of a sufficient number of vesicles to maintain neurotransmitter release during sustained activity (Zhou et al., 2017Zhou L. McInnes J. Wierda K. Holt M. Herrmann A.G. Jackson R.J. Wang Y.-C. Swerts J. Beyens J. Miskiewicz K. et al.Tau association with synaptic vesicles causes presynaptic dysfunction.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15295Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We show here that Syngr mediates the association of Tau with SVs, and we therefore assessed whether the reduction of Syngr is sufficient to rescue Tau-induced presynaptic defects. As a readout of SV crosslinking, we examined the mobility of SVs at larval NMJs using a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay. In larvae expressing the live SV marker Synaptotagmin-GFP (Syt-GFP), photobleaching of a small area of SVs within a presynaptic bouton depletes Syt-GFP fluorescence from those SVs, and the recovery of fluorescence signal over time in that area therefore reflects the mobility of other SVs that diffuse in (Seabrooke et al., 2010Seabrooke S. Qiu X. Stewart B.A. Nonmuscle Myosin II helps regulate synaptic vesicle mobility at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.BMC Neurosci. 2010; 11: 37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In comparison to controls, SV mobility at presynaptic boutons in larvae expressing three independent pathogenic Tau mutants was reduced, indicative of Tau-induced SV crosslinking (Figures 5A–5D, solid lines). In contrast, heterozygous loss of Syngr was sufficient to restore SV mobility back to control levels on all three mutant Tau backgrounds (Figures 5A–5D, dotted lines). This rescue of SV mobility was specific to pathogenic Tau-induced deficits, as syngr+/− alone on a WT background did not affect SV mobility (Figure 5E). Thus, Syngr-dependent binding of Tau to SVs directly impairs SV mobility at presynaptic terminals. We next assessed whether Syngr mediates Tau-induced defects in neurotransmitter release by acquiring electrophysiological recordings at larval NMJs. Larvae expressing mutant TauP301L did not show apparent defects in spontaneous release or evoked release in response to short stimuli (Figure S4), but they did show impaired release during sustained activity, exhibiting progressively lower excitatory junction potential (EJP) amplitudes in response to 10-Hz stimulation for 10 min (Figures 5F–5H, blue). Upon the reduction of Syngr levels (syngr+/−), however, activity-dependent release was rescued back to control levels (Figures 5F–5H, orange). Again, this rescue was specific to pathogenic Tau-induced deficits, as syngr+/− mutant larvae alone did not exhibit differences in spontaneous or evoked neurotransmitter release during short or sustained stimulation (Figures 5F–5H, gray; Figure S4). Taken together, these data support our model that presynaptically localized pathogenic Tau directly binds and crosslinks SVs via Syngr, preventing vesicle recruitment into release and ultimately attenuating neurotransmission during sustained activity. The mammalian genome encodes four Synaptogyrins that are distantly related to Synaptophysin and Synaptoporin, all of which share a common topology of four transmembrane domains with cytoplasmic exposed N- and C-terminal tails (Kedra et al., 1998Kedra D. Pan H.Q. Seroussi E. Fransson I. Guilbaud C. Collins J.E. Dunham I. Blennow E. Roe B.A. Piehl F. Dumanski J.P. Characterization of the human synaptogyrin gene family.Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Only Syngr1 and Syngr3 are neuron specific and present on SVs (Belizaire et al., 2004Belizaire R. Komanduri C. Wooten K. Chen M. Thaller C. Janz R. Characterization of synaptogyrin 3 as a new synaptic vesicle protein.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 470: 266-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our proteomics screen only identified Syngr3 as a Tau interactor, and we therefore set out to test if the reduction of Syngr3 is sufficient to ameliorate synaptic dysfunction in neurons of a well-established transgenic mouse model of Tauopathy. Tau PS19 mice express human FTDP-17 clinical mutant TauP301S and show disease-relevant features of synaptic dysfunction, synapse loss, and neurodegeneration during aging (Yoshiyama et al., 2007Yoshiyama Y.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear how segment-specific motor computations are processed because the cardinal interneuron classes that control motor neurons appear uniform at each level of the spinal cord. V2a interneurons are essential to both forelimb and hindlimb movements, and here we identify two major types that emerge during development: type I neurons marked by high Chx10 form recurrent networks with neighboring spinal neurons and type II neurons that downregulate Chx10 and project to supraspinal structures. Types I and II V2a interneurons are arrayed in counter-gradients, and this network activates different patterns of motor output at cervical and lumbar levels. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed type I and II V2a neurons are each comprised of multiple subtypes. Our findings uncover a molecular and anatomical organization of V2a interneurons reminiscent of the orderly way motor neurons are divided into columns and pools."

Contextual discrimination is a fundamental process that is thought to depend on the prefrontal cortex to integrate sensory information from the environment and regulate adaptive responses to threat during uncertainty. However, the precise prefrontal circuits necessary for discriminating a previously threatening context from a neutral context remain unknown. Using a combination of single-unit recordings and optogenetic manipulations, we identified a neuronal subpopulation in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) that projects to the lateral and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (l/vlPAG) and is selectively activated during contextual fear discrimination. Moreover, optogenetic activation and inhibition of this neuronal population promoted contextual fear discrimination and generalization, respectively. Our results identify a subpopulation of dmPFC-l/vlPAG-projecting neurons that control switching between different emotional states during contextual discrimination."

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus with teratogenic effects on fetal brain, but the spectrum of ZIKV-induced brain injury is unknown, particularly when ultrasound imaging is normal. In a pregnant pigtail macaque (Macaca nemestrina) model of ZIKV infection, we demonstrate that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, and may be challenging to detect in a clinical setting. A common and subtle injury pattern was identified, including (i) periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical brain volume, (ii) injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis and (iii) loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (temporal cortex) and subgranular zone (dentate gyrus, hippocampus) with dysmorphic granule neuron patterning. Attenuation of fetal neurogenic output demonstrates potentially considerable teratogenic effects of congenital ZIKV infection even without microcephaly. Our findings suggest that all children exposed to ZIKV in utero should receive long-term monitoring for neurocognitive deficits, regardless of head size at birth."

Here, single-vessel fMRI reveals vessel-specific correlation patterns in both rodents and humans. In anesthetized rats, fluctuations in the vessel-specific fMRI signal are correlated with the intracellular calcium signal measured in neighboring neurons. Further, the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal from individual venules and the cerebral-blood-volume signal from individual arterioles show correlations at ultra-slow (<0.1 Hz), anesthetic-modulated rhythms. These data support a model that links neuronal activity to intrinsic oscillations in the cerebral vasculature, with a spatial correlation length of ∼2 mm for arterioles. In complementary data from awake human subjects, the BOLD signal is spatially correlated among sulcus veins and specified intracortical veins of the visual cortex at similar ultra-slow rhythms. These data support the use of fMRI to resolve functional connectivity at the level of single vessels."

The treatment options for lung nodules depend on their diagnosis, benign or malignant. Conventionally, lung nodule diagnosis is based on invasive biopsy. Recently, radiomics features, a non-invasive method based on clinical images, have shown high potential in lesion classification, treatment outcome prediction. Methods Lung nodule classification using radiomics based on Computed Tomography (CT) image data was investigated and a 4-feature signature was introduced for lung nodule classification. Retrospectively, 72 patients with 75 pulmonary nodules were collected. Radiomics feature extraction was performed on non-enhanced CT images with contours which were delineated by an experienced radiation oncologist. Result Among the 750 image features in each case, 76 features were found to have significant differences between benign and malignant lesions. A radiomics signature was composed of the best 4 features which included Laws_LSL_min, Laws_SLL_energy, Laws_SSL_skewness and Laws_EEL_uniformity. The accuracy using the signature in benign or malignant classification was 84% with the sensitivity of 92.85% and the specificity of 72.73%. Conclusion The classification signature based on radiomics features demonstrated very good accuracy and high potential in clinical application."

The detection of sound is essential for communication and survival in natural environments.

Given the diversity of local tuning and intracortical connectivity, subsets of neurons in A1 might process auditory and task-related information differently and might therefore uniquely contribute to auditory-based decision-making. To investigate how neurons represent task-related and sensory information in A1 L2/3, we used in vivo two-photon (2P) imaging to record the activity of many individual neurons simultaneously in mice during the performance of a tone-detection task. We found that most neurons had increased responses to target tones when the mouse correctly detected the target, while a minority of neurons showed decreased activity during correct detections. This neural correlate of attentional gain was similar across neurons tuned near or far from the target frequency. Granger causality (GC) and noise correlation analysis revealed that functional connectivity in small neural networks is modulated by auditory task performance. Small populations of four to five neurons in A1 formed sparsely connected and locally clustered subnetworks with enhanced encoding of behavioral choice. Our data suggest that in A1 L2/3, the activity of large neuronal populations is modulated by attentional gain, yet only small neuronal networks are necessary to encode behavioral choice. To study the neural coding of decision-making, we designed a simple tone-detection task that used behavioral response-timing rules to induce well-controlled behavioral responses in mice (Figure 1). We trained ten head-fixed CBA mice and then imaged in A1 using in vivo 2P Ca2+ imaging while the mice performed the tone-detection task (Figure 1A). Each trial of the task began with a 1-s pre-stimulus silence, followed by a 1 s, 55 dB sound pressure level (SPL) target tone with 8 Hz amplitude modulation (Figure 1B) and then a 2.5 s silent interval. We chose 55 dB SPL, since at this sound level the mice performed consistently above chance (50%) for a wide range of tones (Figure 1C). Inter-trial intervals (ITIs) were randomized between 5 and 9 s. Mice were trained to lick a waterspout only after detecting the target tone. When the first lick on a trial occurred during the reward time window (i.e., a rewarded hit; 0.5–2.5 s after the tone onset; gray shading, Figure 1B, top panel), water was delivered for 2 s. If the mouse licked before the 0.5 s delay during a trial (i.e., a punished hit), no water was delivered for subsequent licks during that trial, and 8 s were added to the ITI. On miss trials, the mouse did not lick the waterspout. The mice typically ceased licking the waterspout quickly after making a punished hit, which is not surprising since no water was delivered (Figure 1B). In contrast, the mice licked robustly after the water was delivered on rewarded hits (Figure 1B). In individual trials (Figure 1B, lower panel), and on average across experiments and mice (Figure 1D), behavioral response latencies (τ) tended to be longer than the 0.5 s wait period (experiments, τ = 0.67 ± 0.42 s; mice, τ = 0.61 ± 0.28 s), which indicates that licking was not random, and was well timed to tone presentation. Across the presented tones, task performance was reliable, yet with high enough error rates to allow investigation on the neural correlates of behavioral choice (Figure 1E). While both punished and rewarded hits indicated tone detection (i.e., the first lick on a trial occurred after tone onset), tone detections occurred more often during rewarded hits (bootstrap t test; experiments, p < 0.001; mice, p = 0.04). Thus, to increase the likelihood that hit trials occurred when the mice were actively listening, we only used the rewarded hit (i.e., active) trials for most of our main analysis of neural data (except Figure 4). We injected AAV1.hSyn1.mRuby2.GSG.P2A.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 (Rose et al., 2016Rose T. Jaepel J. Hübener M. Bonhoeffer T. Cell-specific restoration of stimulus preference after monocular deprivation in the visual cortex.Science. 2016; 352: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) into A1 (Figures 2, S1, and S2) of CBA mice (∼postnatal day 42–50) allowing the simultaneous observation of Ca2+-dependent fluorescence, as well Ca2+-independent visualization of cell bodies (Meng et al., 2017Meng X. Winkowski D.E. Kao J.P.Y. Kanold P.O. Sublaminar subdivision of mouse auditory cortex layer 2/3 based on functional translaminar connections.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 10200-10214Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For both wide-field (WF) and 2P imaging, neuronal activity was quantified by comparing fluorescence during the stimulus versus the silent pre-stimulus baseline, resulting in a response amplitude (ΔF/F). To localize 2P imaging fields for each experiment to A1, we first mapped the frequency organization of auditory cortex in each mouse (Figures 2A and S1) (Meng et al., 2017Meng X. Winkowski D.E. Kao J.P.Y. Kanold P.O. Sublaminar subdivision of mouse auditory cortex layer 2/3 based on functional translaminar connections.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 10200-10214Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To identify cellular responses, we performed 2P imaging. For each 2P imaging field, we first determined the frequency selectivity (best frequency [BF]) of individual neurons (Figure 2B) during passive trials, i.e., when the mouse sat quiescently hearing tones. Cells showed different neighboring BFs (Figure 2B, right) and trial-to-trial response variability (Figures 2D and 2E), consistent with previous findings (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010Bandyopadhyay S.

We imaged cells with BFs spanning 1–50 kHz, thus including cells both within and outside the range of our target frequencies (Figure 2C). We imaged 7,879 neurons in 80 experiments, of which 4,316 neurons were included in the analysis (Figure S3). Figure 3A shows the average fluorescence response time courses for the entire population of individual neurons during target tone presentations on passive, hit, and miss trials. Most neurons (3,762/4,316, 87%) showed an increase in tone-evoked response amplitudes during hit versus passive trials (p < 0.001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov [KS] tests). However, since the encoding of task-related information may still occur in the absence of tone-evoked neural responses, we included all 4,316 neurons in our analysis. Most neurons (3,302/4,316, 77%) showed increased fluorescence relative to baseline (i.e., facilitative responses; average ΔF/F = 24.3% ± 0.7%; Figure 3A). A minority of neurons (1,014/4,316, 23%) showed decreased fluorescence relative to baseline activity (i.e., suppressive responses; average ΔF/F = −22.1% ± 1.5%; Figure 3A). Facilitative responses were largest during hit trials and smallest during miss trials (Kruskal-Wallis [KW] test; p < 0.001; Figures 3B and 3C). Similarly, suppressive responses were largest for hit trials (KW test, p < 0.001). We also observed that facilitative responses during miss trials were smaller than passive response to target tones (bootstrap t test, p < 0.001; Figures 3B and 3C). Together, we find that neural responses to target tones were generally enhanced during target detection. We quantified the effect of tone detection for each neuron by calculating the difference in response magnitude between hit and passive trials. We then averaged over time after the tone onset, resulting in a single value for each neuron that we interpreted as attentional gain, for both facilitative and suppressive responses (Figure 3D). In total, 1,036/4,316 cells (24%) had positive attentional gain across trials (KS test, p < 0.05). The 1,036 neurons were distributed across all mice and experiments. Indeed, positive attentional gain was present in each mouse (Figure 3D, right panel). Thus, attentional gain during hit trials was a robust phenomenon and tended to be twice as large for suppressive responses compared to facilitative responses (∼20% versus ∼10%). Together, our results indicate that tone detection increases the magnitude of both facilitative and suppressive auditory-evoked responses in A1. Because of local heterogeneity in neuronal BFs (Figure 2B), any given target tone frequency may not be close to each neuron’s BF. This allowed us to probe whether the amount of attentional gain could depend on the relationship between target frequency and neuronal BF. To increase the likelihood of target frequencies falling near a given neuron’s BF, for each experiment we selected one frequency from a set of target frequencies between 4 and 32 kHz. We separated neurons into two groups according to the octave difference between BF and the target frequency for a given experiment (ΔTAR ≤ 0.5 and ΔTAR > 0.5), while pooling across neurons showing facilitative and suppressive responses, since both populations showed positive attentional gain (Figure 3D). Individual cells in both ΔTAR groups had positive (KS test, p < 0.05; Figure 3E) but similar (bootstrap t test, p = 0.12) attentional gain. Thus, attentional gain was common and largely independent of frequency tuning. Behavioral choice involves at least two distinct processes: perceptual recognition and motor control (i.e., licking) to indicate choice. Since auditory cortex can exhibit motor related activity (Nelson and Mooney, 2016Nelson A. Mooney R. The basal forebrain and motor cortex provide convergent yet distinct movement-related inputs to the auditory cortex.Neuron. 2016; 90: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we sought to delineate which part of the modulation is due to perceptual versus motor-related signals. To identify potential motor signals in A1, we compared lick-triggered averages of neural responses during silence versus tones. We averaged the response amplitude (ΔF/F) during the time following licks made during the pre-stimulus silence. We did not observe any significant lick-related activity (Figure 4A; ΔF/F = 0.6% ± 0.13%, bootstrap t test, p = 0.42). Since both hit and miss trials contained tone responses, but only hit trials contained licks, analysis of the difference between hit and miss trials describes the neural activity during licks with perceptual recognition of the target. The activity difference between hit and miss trials was positive (Figure 4A; ΔF/F = 5% ± 0.52%, bootstrap t test, p < 0.001). This indicates that while motor signals during licking did not appear to cause activity in A1 L2/3 neurons, task-related modulations of neural activity in A1 reflect perceptual recognition during behavioral choice. Single units in the primary visual cortex have been shown to encode the timing of behavioral choice during a visual detection task that incorporated delayed behavioral response-timing rules (Levy et al., 2017Levy J.M. Zold C.L. Namboodiri V.M.K. Hussain Shuler M.G. The timing of reward-seeking action tracks visually cued theta oscillations in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 10408-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In our task, the mice were required to delay behavioral responses until 0.5 s after the tone onset to receive a reward. Thus, neuronal responses in A1 might encode the timing of behavioral choice during our task. We thus compared neuronal responses during punished versus rewarded hits (Figure 4B). Neural response latencies (τ = time to half-peak response) in each experiment appear to cluster by response type, mainly because of the task’s response-timing rules that defined punished versus rewarded hits (Figure 4C, left). On average, neural response latencies during rewarded hits were longer than for punished hits (Figure 4C, right) (bootstrap t test, p < 0.001; τ = 0.75 ± 0.14 versus 1.01 ± 0.014, punished versus rewarded hits, respectively). Since we did not detect lick-related motor signals in A1, our data suggest that the difference in neural response latencies reflects a perceptual, rather than motor-related, decision timing. Non-auditory information, such as reward size and outcome, and the use of punishment versus reward during operant conditioning may also influence the suppression or facilitation of activity in A1 (Brosch et al., 2011Brosch M. Selezneva E. Scheich H. Representation of reward feedback in primate auditory cortex.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2011; 5: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, David et al., 2012David S.V.

USA. 2012; 109: 2144-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, Weis et al., 2013Weis T. Brechmann A. Puschmann S. Thiel C.M. Feedback that confirms reward expectation triggers auditory cortex activity.J. Neurophysiol. 2013; 110: 1860-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which suggests that in addition to attentional gain, the outcome of behavioral choice (i.e., “decision cost”) may be represented in the auditory cortex. In our task design, both punished and rewarded hits indicated that the animal correctly detected the target tone (i.e., the first lick in a trial occurred after the tone onset). However, the cost of punished hits was the removal of the reward and a timeout. Thus, the difference between neural activity during rewarded versus punished hits describes how a cost analysis of behavioral choice (i.e., evaluating the outcome of choice in terms of punishment versus reward) may be represented in neural populations. The difference in activity between punished hits and rewarded hits (decision-cost signal) was negative (Figure 4D) during the behavioral response delay period, most likely reflecting either behavioral error recognition (i.e., impending punishment), and/or the difference in neural response latencies related to decision timing. The decision-cost signal then increased to positive values representing reward. In total, 20% of individual neurons had significant decision-cost signals (KS test, p < 0.05) and neurons with decision-cost signals were present in 9/10 mice, indicating that like attentional gain, decision-cost signaling is common across A1 L2/3. The average decision-cost signal amplitude was ∼10% (bootstrap t test, p < 0.001; Figure 4E) and thus similar in amplitude to the attentional gain signal (Figure 3). Together, our data suggest that neural populations in A1 are driven by the sum of sensory input, attentional gain, and a cost function of behavioral choice (Figure 4F). A1 contains neuronal subpopulations whose interactivity can be characterized by pairwise noise correlations (Rothschild et al., 2010Rothschild G. Nelken I. Mizrahi A.

The average noise correlation during passive trials was 0.155 ± 0.006, consistent with previous findings (Rothschild et al., 2010Rothschild G. Nelken I. Mizrahi A.

However, comparison of the noise correlation cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) during passive versus hit trials (Figure 5A) revealed an inflection point (r = 0.09; vertical dotted line in Figure 5A). Above the inflection point, noise correlations decreased during tone detection (Δr− = −0.12 ± 0.006, bootstrap t test, p < 0.001; Figure 5B), whereas below the inflection point, noise correlations increased during tone detection (Δr+ = 0.15 ± 0.008, bootstrap t test, p < 0.001; Figure 5B). Furthermore, the magnitude of the change in noise correlations for Δr+ cells was greater than that for Δr− cells (bootstrap t test, p < 0.001). In total, 2,756/4,316 (64%) and 1,560/4,316 (36%) of neurons fell within the Δr− and Δr+ groups, respectively. We find that, despite the larger population of cells that had decreased noise correlations during task performance, the dominant effect of attention, in terms of effect size, was to increased noise correlations, and thus by interpretation, increased functional connectivity in A1. Cells with similar tuning have a higher chance of being connected (Ko et al., 2011Ko H. Hofer S.B. Pichler B. Buchanan K.A. Sjöström P.J. Mrsic-Flogel T.D.

Dopamine replacement therapy with levodopa alleviates parkinsonian motor symptoms but is complicated by the development of involuntary movements, termed levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Aberrant activity in the striatum has been hypothesized to cause LID. Here, to establish a direct link between striatal activity and dyskinesia, we combine optogenetics and a method to manipulate dyskinesia-associated neurons, targeted recombination in active populations (TRAP). We find that TRAPed cells are a stable subset of sensorimotor striatal neurons, predominantly from the direct pathway, and that reactivation of TRAPed striatal neurons causes dyskinesia in the absence of levodopa. Inhibition of TRAPed cells, but not a nonspecific subset of direct pathway neurons, ameliorates LID. These results establish that a distinct subset of striatal neurons is causally involved in LID and indicate that successful therapeutic strategies for treating LID may require targeting functionally selective neuronal subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2747100022,"Summary Neuronal maturation requires dramatic morphological and functional changes, but the molecular mechanisms governing this process are not well understood. Here, we studied the role of Rbfox1, Rbfox2, and Rbfox3 proteins, a family of tissue-specific splicing regulators mutated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. We generated Rbfox triple knockout (tKO) ventral spinal neurons to define a comprehensive network of alternative exons under Rbfox regulation and to investigate their functional importance in the developing neurons. Rbfox tKO neurons exhibit defects in alternative splicing of many cytoskeletal, membrane, and synaptic proteins, and display immature electrophysiological activity. The axon initial segment (AIS), a subcellular structure important for action potential initiation, is diminished upon Rbfox depletion. We identified an Rbfox-regulated splicing switch in ankyrin G, the AIS interaction hub protein, that regulates ankyrin G-beta spectrin affinity and AIS assembly. Our data show that the Rbfox-regulated splicing program plays a crucial role in structural and functional maturation of postmitotic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2787477673,"Hedgehog pathway-dependent cancers can escape Smoothened (SMO) inhibition through mutations in genes encoding canonical hedgehog pathway components; however, around 50% of drug-resistant basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) lack additional variants of these genes. Here we use multidimensional genomics analysis of human and mouse drug-resistant BCCs to identify a noncanonical hedgehog activation pathway driven by the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). Active SRF along with its coactivator megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) binds DNA near hedgehog target genes and forms a previously unknown protein complex with the hedgehog transcription factor glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger-1 (GLI1), causing amplification of GLI1 transcriptional activity. We show that cytoskeletal activation through Rho and the formin family member Diaphanous (mDia) is required for SRF-MKL-driven GLI1 activation and for tumor cell viability. Remarkably, nuclear MKL1 staining served as a biomarker in tumors from mice and human subjects to predict tumor responsiveness to MKL inhibitors, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway. Thus, our study illuminates, for the first time, cytoskeletal-activation-driven transcription as a personalized therapeutic target for combatting drug-resistant malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2785656937,"Changes in climate variability are as important for society to address as are changes in mean climate. Contrasting temperature variability during the Last Glacial Maximum and the Holocene can provide insights into the relationship between the mean state of the climate and its variability. However, although glacial-interglacial changes in variability have been quantified for Greenland, a global view remains elusive. Here we use a network of marine and terrestrial temperature proxies to show that temperature variability decreased globally by a factor of four as the climate warmed by 3-8 degrees Celsius from the Last Glacial Maximum (around 21,000 years ago) to the Holocene epoch (the past 11,500 years). This decrease had a clear zonal pattern, with little change in the tropics (by a factor of only 1.6-2.8) and greater change in the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres (by a factor of 3.3-14). By contrast, Greenland ice-core records show a reduction in temperature variability by a factor of 73, suggesting influences beyond local temperature or a decoupling of atmospheric and global surface temperature variability for Greenland. The overall pattern of reduced variability can be explained by changes in the meridional temperature gradient, a mechanism that points to further decreases in temperature variability in a warmer future."

Here, we found that only the bilateral frontopolar cortices (area 10) are recruited for metacognitive evaluation of non-experienced events in macaque monkeys performing metacognitive confidence judgment on memory under fMRI scanning and that targeted reversible inactivation of the localized spots in area 10 selectively impaired the confidence judgment of non-experienced events. In contrast, fMRI experiments revealed that area 10 was not recruited for metacognition of experienced events like the way that the dorsal prefrontal cortex (area 9) was and, correspondingly, the inactivation of area 10 did not impair confidence judgment of experienced events. Notably, this inactivation did not impair the ability to identify novel events by distinguishing from repetitive events. Our findings elucidate that the frontopolar cortex plays a causal role to confer not awareness of past experience in general but awareness of one's own ignorance."
https://openalex.org/W2793852491,"In recent years, there have been increasing numbers of infectious disease outbreaks that spread rapidly to population centers resulting from global travel, population vulnerabilities, environmental factors, and ecological disasters such as floods and earthquakes. Some examples of the recent outbreaks are the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Co) in the Middle East, and the Zika outbreak through the Americas. We have created a generic protocol for detection of pathogen RNA and/or DNA using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and reverse dot-blot for detection (RDB) and processed automatically in a microfluidic device. In particular, we describe how a microfluidic assay to detect HIV viral RNA was converted to detect Zika virus (ZIKV) RNA. We first optimized the RT-LAMP assay to detect ZIKV RNA using a benchtop isothermal amplification device. Then we implemented the assay in a microfluidic device that will allow analyzing 24 samples simultaneously and automatically from sample introduction to detection by RDB technique. Preliminary data using saliva samples spiked with ZIKV showed that our diagnostic system detects ZIKV RNA in saliva. These results will be validated in further experiments with well-characterized ZIKV human specimens of saliva. The described strategy and methodology to convert the HIV diagnostic assay and platform to a ZIKV RNA detection assay provides a model that can be readily utilized for detection of the next emerging or re-emerging infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W2785771122,"An Antarctic ice core reveals that, during the last ice age, the topography of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets shifted tropical Pacific convection eastward, increasing climate variability in the high southern latitudes. During glacial maxima, ice covered vast areas of the Northern Hemisphere and had a broad influence across the global climate system. Tyler Jones and colleagues show that climate variability in the Southern Hemisphere was influenced by these large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and was about twice as high during the Last Glacial Maximum than in the warmer Holocene that followed. The ice sheets created more elevated and brighter surfaces than at present and this altered the location of tropical convection and the atmospheric pathways that link the tropics to West Antarctica. The results reveal the intimate climatic link between the high latitudes, and the key role of the tropics as an interhemispheric mediator. The presence of large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and reduced greenhouse gas concentrations during the Last Glacial Maximum fundamentally altered global ocean–atmosphere climate dynamics1. Model simulations and palaeoclimate records suggest that glacial boundary conditions affected the El Niño–Southern Oscillation2,3, a dominant source of short-term global climate variability. Yet little is known about changes in short-term climate variability at mid- to high latitudes. Here we use a high-resolution water isotope record from West Antarctica to demonstrate that interannual to decadal climate variability at high southern latitudes was almost twice as large at the Last Glacial Maximum as during the ensuing Holocene epoch (the past 11,700 years). Climate model simulations indicate that this increased variability reflects an increase in the teleconnection strength between the tropical Pacific and West Antarctica, owing to a shift in the mean location of tropical convection. This shift, in turn, can be attributed to the influence of topography and albedo of the North American ice sheets on atmospheric circulation. As the planet deglaciated, the largest and most abrupt decline in teleconnection strength occurred between approximately 16,000 years and 15,000 years ago, followed by a slower decline into the early Holocene."
https://openalex.org/W2793190614,"Alterations in ERBB family members have been associated with many tumor malignancies. EGFR and ERBB2 have been extensively explored in clinical oncology and several drugs currently target them therapeutically. However, the significance of ERBB4 as a potential therapeutic target remains mostly unexplored, even though ERBB4 is overexpressed or mutated in many solid tumors. Using a unique functional protein microarray platform, we found that ibrutinib inhibits ERBB4 activity in the same nM range as its canonical target, BTK. Cell-based assays revealed that ibrutinib treatment inhibited cell growth and decreased phosphorylation of ERBB4 and downstream targets MEK and ERK in cancer cell lines with high levels of endogenous ERBB4. In vivo, ibrutinib-responsive mouse xenograft tumors showed decreased tumor volumes with ibrutinib treatment. Interestingly, global gene expression comparisons between responsive and non-responsive cells identified a signature featuring the WNT pathway that predicts growth responsiveness to ibrutinib. Non-responsive ERBB4-expressing cell lines featured elevated activity of the WNT pathway, through the overexpression of WNT5A. Moreover, inhibition of WNT5A expression led to an ibrutinib response in non-responsive cell lines. Our data show that inhibiting ERBB4 reduces cell growth in cells that have low WNT5A expression and reveal a link between the ERBB4 and WNT pathways."

In the first game scenario, players were not informed about the time duration or initial match status. In the second, players were only informed they would be required to play a small-sided game for 12 minutes. In the third, players were told they would play a small-sided game for 12 minutes and that one of the teams was winning 2 to 0. Finally, in the fourth game scenario, players were instructed they would play a small-sided game for 12 minutes and the score lines used at the start of the previous game scenario were reversed. The results showed a tendency for the unknown task duration to elicit greater physical responses in all studied variables, compared with knowing the task duration. Knowing the task duration and starting the game winning or losing did not affect the players' activity profile between the two conditions. Thus, during small-sided soccer games, knowledge (or not) about the exercise duration alters the pacing behaviour of the players. Moreover, short and undisclosed-length exercise durations resulted in the adoption of more aggressive pacing strategies, characterised by higher initial exercise intensities. Furthermore, previous information on match status does not seem to interfere with pacing patterns if the players are aware of the exercise duration. Coaches may use knowledge of exercise duration to manipulate the small-sided games' demands."
https://openalex.org/W2786146533,"The online maintenance and manipulation of information in working memory (WM) is essential for guiding behavior based on our goals. Understanding how WM alters sensory processing in pursuit of different behavioral objectives is therefore crucial to establish the neural basis of our goal-directed behavior. Here we show that, in the middle temporal (MT) area of rhesus monkeys, the power of the local field potentials in the αβ band (8-25 Hz) increases, reflecting the remembered location and the animal's performance. Moreover, the content of WM determines how coherently MT sites oscillate and how synchronized spikes are relative to these oscillations. These changes in spike timing are not only sufficient to carry sensory and memory information, they can also account for WM-induced sensory enhancement. These results provide a mechanistic-level understanding of how WM alters sensory processing by coordinating the timing of spikes across the neuronal population, enhancing the sensory representation of WM targets."

Precise formation of neural circuits is fundamental for proper function of the nervous system. Exuberant synaptic connections are formed initially around birth, and then neural circuits are shaped by selective strengthening of necessary synapses and elimination of unnecessary redundant connections during later postnatal period (Kano and Hashimoto, 2009Kano M. Hashimoto K. Synapse elimination in the central nervous system.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, Lichtman and Colman, 2000Lichtman J.W. Colman H.

This process, generally known as synapse elimination, is crucial for the establishment of functionally mature neural circuits from neonatal immature ones. Among several models of synapse elimination in the developing brain, postnatal development of climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell (PC) synapses in the cerebellum has been most extensively studied (Crepel, 1982Crepel F. Regression of functional synapses in the immature mammalian cerebellum.Trends Neurosci. 1982; 5: 266-269Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (175) Google Scholar, Hashimoto and Kano, 2013Hashimoto K. Kano M. Synapse elimination in the developing cerebellum.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 4667-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In neonatal rodents, multiple CFs with similar synaptic strengths innervate the soma of each PC (Hashimoto and Kano, 2003Hashimoto K. Kano M. Functional differentiation of multiple climbing fiber inputs during synapse elimination in the developing cerebellum.Neuron. 2003; 38: 785-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a single CF is selectively strengthened among multiple CFs in each PC during the first postnatal week (Hashimoto and Kano, 2003Hashimoto K. Kano M. Functional differentiation of multiple climbing fiber inputs during synapse elimination in the developing cerebellum.Neuron. 2003; 38: 785-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Then, only the strengthened CF (the “winner” CF) extends its innervation over growing dendrites of PCs (Hashimoto et al., 2009aHashimoto K. Ichikawa R. Kitamura K. Watanabe M. Kano M.

USA. 2016; 113: 2282-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, the other weaker CFs (the “loser” CFs) are left on the PC soma and then mostly eliminated during the second postnatal week (Bosman and Konnerth, 2009Bosman L.W. Konnerth A.

Kano M. Synapse elimination in the developing cerebellum.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 4667-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). While many molecules involved in elimination of redundant CF synapses have been identified (Hashimoto and Kano, 2013Hashimoto K. Kano M. Synapse elimination in the developing cerebellum.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 4667-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), relatively little is known about how single CFs are strengthened and then undergo translocation to PC dendrites. In the present study, we searched for retrograde signaling molecules that are expressed in PCs and influence developmental CF synapse elimination. We found that knockdown of progranulin in PCs accelerated CF synapse elimination and reduced CF synaptic inputs. Progranulin is a multi-functional growth factor and is widely known to be involved in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (Baker et al., 2006Baker M. Mackenzie I.R. Pickering-Brown S.M. Gass J. Rademakers R. Lindholm C. Snowden J. Adamson J. Sadovnick A.D.

We show that progranulin derived from PCs retrogradely strengthens CF synaptic inputs and counteracts elimination of redundant CF synapses in the developing mouse cerebellum. Our results provide new insight into the roles of progranulin in the developing brain. We screened candidate genes for retrograde signaling molecules that are expressed in PCs during the process of synapse elimination. In olivo-cerebellar co-cultures (Uesaka et al., 2012Uesaka N. Mikuni T. Hashimoto K. Hirai H. Sakimura K. Kano M. Organotypic coculture preparation for the study of developmental synapse elimination in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 11657-11670Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we applied lentiviral knockdown vectors, each containing engineered microRNA (miRNA) targeting a candidate gene and an enhanced GFP (EGFP) under the control of L7 promoter, at the day of preparation (0 days in vitro [0 DIV]) (Uesaka et al., 2012Uesaka N. Mikuni T. Hashimoto K. Hirai H. Sakimura K. Kano M. Organotypic coculture preparation for the study of developmental synapse elimination in mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 11657-11670Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, Uesaka et al., 2014Uesaka N. Uchigashima M. Mikuni T. Nakazawa T. Nakao H. Hirai H. Aiba A. Watanabe M. Kano M. Retrograde semaphorin signaling regulates synapse elimination in the developing mouse brain.Science. 2014; 344: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Then we analyzed CF innervation of PCs electrophysiologically at 15–18 DIV in co-cultures by using whole-cell recordings from EGFP-positive knockdown PCs and EGFP-negative control PCs. Among several genes whose knockdown in PCs induced alteration in CF innervation, we focused on granulin (Grn), a causative gene of a certain form of frontotemporal dementia that encodes a multi-functional growth factor, progranulin. We found that about 65% of PCs with progranulin knockdown were innervated by single CFs, whereas less than 30% of control PCs did so (Figures S1A–S1E). Moreover, the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents induced by CF stimulation (CF-EPSCs) became significantly smaller after progranulin knockdown (Figure S1F). The effects of progranulin knockdown were restored by simultaneous expression of cDNA that encode an miRNA-resistant form of Grn (Grn-RES) (Figures S1A–S1F). Thus, the acceleration of CF synapse elimination and the suppression of CF-EPSC amplitude were caused by the loss of function of progranulin in PCs. Our fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis confirmed strong expression of progranulin in mouse cerebellar cells including PCs at postnatal day 12 (P12) and in adulthood (Figure S1G). We generated conditional knockout mice in which the gene and protein of progranulin were deleted in PCs (Grn-cKO; Figures S1H–S1J). We found no apparent differences in the foliation and layer structure of the cerebellum and the dendritic morphology of PCs between wild-type (WT) and Grn-cKO mice (Figures S1K and S1L), indicating that gross anatomy of the cerebellum is normal in Grn-cKO mice. We examined CF innervation in WT and Grn-cKO mice electrophysiologically in acute cerebellar slices from P8 to P30. We found that PCs in Grn-cKO mice had significantly fewer CFs than those of WT mice from P11 to P16 (Figures 1C–1H ). In contrast, there was no difference in the number of CFs innervating each PC between genotypes from P8 to P10 (Figures 1A and 1B) and from P17 to P30 (Figures 1I–1L). We verified these findings using miRNA-mediated progranulin knockdown in PCs in vivo. In PCs with knockdown of progranulin proteins (Figure S1M), CF synapse elimination was accelerated during P12 to P14 (Figures 1M and 1N) to the same extent as in Grn-cKO mice (Figures 1C–1F). The accelerated CF synapse elimination by progranulin knockdown became normal by simultaneous expression of an miRNA-resistant Grn (Figures 1O and 1P), albeit with a slight increase in the total progranulin level (Figures S1N and S1O). These results indicate that deletion of progranulin in PCs accelerates CF synapse elimination from P11 to P16. Next, we measured the number of CF terminals around the PC soma at P13–P14 by counting large synaptic boutons immunopositive for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2), a marker for CF terminals. We found that 49% of PCs in Grn-cKO had less than three VGluT2-labeled CF terminals around their somata, whereas only 26% of PCs in WT mice did so (Figure 1Q), indicating that elimination of somatic CF synapses was accelerated in PCs of Grn-cKO mice. We evaluated the strengths of the CF inputs in Grn-cKO mice. We found that the amplitude of CF-EPSCs was significantly smaller in Grn-cKO than in WT mice during P11 to P14 (Figure S2A). Further analysis revealed that the strongest CF-EPSCs were selectively affected in Grn-cKO PCs (Figures 2A and S2B). We analyzed quantal EPSCs (qEPSCs) elicited by stimulating single CFs in Sr2+-containing external solution (Hashimoto and Kano, 2003Hashimoto K. Kano M. Functional differentiation of multiple climbing fiber inputs during synapse elimination in the developing cerebellum.Neuron. 2003; 38: 785-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The frequency of qEPSCs for the strongest CFs, but not that for the weaker CFs, was significantly lower in Grn-cKO PCs than in WT PCs (Figures 2B and 2C). In contrast, the amplitudes of qEPSCs for the strongest and weaker CFs were not different between WT and Grn-cKO PCs (Figure 2D). These results indicate that the reduction of the strongest CF input in Grn-cKO PCs results presumably from a decrease in the number of release sites due to reduced innervation by the strongest CF. We then calculated the disparity ratio, which has been used for estimating relative difference among the strengths of multiple CF inputs (Hashimoto and Kano, 2003Hashimoto K. Kano M. Functional differentiation of multiple climbing fiber inputs during synapse elimination in the developing cerebellum.Neuron. 2003; 38: 785-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The values of the disparity ratio were significantly different at P11–P12, but were similar at other postnatal ages between Grn-cKO and WT PCs (Figure S2C). Taken together, these results suggest that progranulin selectively enhances synaptic inputs from the strongest CF during P11 to P16. We examined the extent of CF translocation and the density of CF synapses on PC dendrites. The relative height of VGluT2-labeled CF terminals to the thickness of the molecular layer was significantly reduced in Grn-cKO mice during P12 to P14 (Figure 2E). The reduced CF extension was persistent in mature Grn-cKO mice during P35 to P38 and 2 to 3 months postnatally (Figures 2F and 2G). However, progranulin knockdown in mature PCs after 6 weeks postnatally did not reduce CF extension into dendrites (Figure S3A). The density of CF synapses on PC dendrites was not different between WT and Grn-cKO during P12 to P14, P35 to P38, and adulthood (Figure S3B). These results indicate that the lack of progranulin in PCs during early development causes persistent reduction in dendritic innervation of the strongest CFs, whereas the deletion of progranulin from mature PCs causes no appreciable impairment of CF innervation. Some studies show that progranulin is expressed not only in neurons, but also in microglia (Petkau et al., 2012Petkau T.L. Neal S.J. Milnerwood A. Mew A. Hill A.M. Orban P. Gregg J. Lu G. Feldman H.H. Mackenzie I.R. et al.Synaptic dysfunction in progranulin-deficient mice.Neurobiol. Dis. 2012; 45: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, the progranulin deletion in microglia has been reported to eliminate inhibitory synapses in the ventral thalamus during aging (Lui et al., 2016Lui H. Zhang J. Makinson S.R. Cahill M.K. Kelley K.W. Huang H.Y. Shang Y. Oldham M.C. Martens L.H. Gao F. et al.Progranulin deficiency promotes circuit-specific synaptic pruning by microglia via complement activation.Cell. 2016; 165: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, we found no apparent difference in the cellular density of microglia or the area of microglial processes and cell bodies in the cerebellum between WT and Grn-cKO mice (Figures S3C–S3E). We therefore conclude that progranulin influences CF synapse elimination presumably independently of microglia’s function. Previous studies demonstrate that CF synapse elimination is greatly influenced by impaired parallel fiber (PF)-PC synapse formation (Hashimoto et al., 2001Hashimoto K. Ichikawa R. Takechi H. Inoue Y. Aiba A. Sakimura K. Mishina M. Hashikawa T. Konnerth A. Watanabe M. Kano M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: 7438-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We found that patterns of immunostaining were not altered in Grn-cKO mice for the markers of PF terminal, inhibitory synaptic terminal, PC, or Bergmann glia (Figure S3F), indicating that the basic morphology of these cellular elements is normal in Grn-cKO mice. Relationships between the amplitude of PF-mediated EPSC and the strength of PF stimulus were similar between WT and Grn-cKO mice (Figure S3G). The amplitude and frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were also similar between the two mouse strains (Figure S3H). These results indicate that the progranulin deletion in PCs affects CF synapse development not indirectly through altering structure or function of PF terminals, inhibitory synaptic terminals, or Bergmann glia, but directly through acting on CFs. We next tested whether progranulin deletion in PCs affected motor performance in adulthood. In an open field, activity level was reduced in Grn-cKO mice compared with WT mice (Figure 2H). In a footprint test, Grn-cKO mice showed little front/hind overlap, showing reduced uniformity of step alternation (Figures 2I and 2J). In the footprint test, the frequency of failure, in which mice stopped walking in the middle of runway or did not walk straight, was higher and that of success was lower in Grn-cKO mice (Figure 2K). In a beam walking test, the time from start to goal on the beam tended to be longer in Grn-cKO (Figure S3I). In contrast, we found no significant differences between WT and Grn-cKO mice in a rotarod test (Figure S3J). These results show that the lack of progranulin in PCs causes mild deficit in motor performance. We have previously demonstrated that Sema3A derived from PCs strengthens CF synapses and counteracts CF synapse elimination in the developing cerebellum (Uesaka et al., 2014Uesaka N. Uchigashima M. Mikuni T. Nakazawa T. Nakao H. Hirai H. Aiba A. Watanabe M. Kano M. Retrograde semaphorin signaling regulates synapse elimination in the developing mouse brain.Science. 2014; 344: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To examine the possible interaction between progranulin and Sema3A, we examined the effect of Sema3A knockdown in PCs of Grn-cKO mice. We found that when examined during P12 to P14, Sema3A knockdown further accelerated CF synapse elimination (Figures 3A and 3B ) and reduced the amplitude of the strongest CF-EPSCs (Figure 3C) in Grn-cKO PCs, indicating that the effect of Sema3A knockdown and that of progranulin deletion are additive in PCs. We verified this finding by using lentivirus-mediated progranulin knockdown in PCs. Knockdown of progranulin and that of Sema3A in PCs accelerated CF synapse elimination to a similar extent (Figures 3D and 3E). Double knockdown of these molecules further accelerated CF synapse elimination when compared with the results of knockdown of either molecule alone (Figures 3D and 3E). These results strongly suggest that progranulin does not act downstream or upstream of Sema3A in PCs, and the two pathways cooperate to strengthen CF synapses and counteract CF elimination during P12 to P14. We next examined how progranulin derived from PCs strengthens CF synapses. Sortilin (Sort1) is considered to directly bind to progranulin and to cause its rapid endocytosis into neurons (Hu et al., 2010Hu F. Padukkavidana T. Vægter C.B. Brady O.A. Zheng Y. Mackenzie I.R. Feldman H.H. Nykjaer A. Strittmatter S.M. Sortilin-mediated endocytosis determines levels of the frontotemporal dementia protein, progranulin.Neuron. 2010; 68: 654-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Our FISH analysis in the inferior olive shows that VGluT2-positive neurons projecting CFs, but not glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67)-positive interneurons, strongly expressed Sort1 mRNA during the period of CF synapse elimination (Figures 4A and S4A). To examine whether Sort1 is involved in CF synapse elimination, we injected lentiviruses designed to express engineered miRNA against Sort1 together with EGFP into the inferior olive of mice at P1–P2. Our in vitro assay confirmed that the miRNA suppressed the expression of Sort 1 mRNA in HEK cells (Figure S4B). We then made whole-cell recordings from PCs in acute cerebellar slices prepared from the mice during P12 to P14. We confirmed that Sort 1 mRNA and protein were deleted in EGFP-positive inferior olivary neurons (Figure S4C) and in EGFP-positive CFs (Figure S4D), respectively. We found that PCs surrounded by CFs in which Sort1 was knocked down were innervated by significantly fewer CFs when compared with control PCs sampled from where Sort1 knockdown CFs were absent in the same slices (Figures 4B and 4C). The effects of Sort1 knockdown were rescued by coexpression of an miRNA-resistant Sort1 (Sort1-RES) (Figures 4D, 4E, and S4B) with the total Sort 1 level similar to the control (Figures S4E and S4F). The EPSC amplitudes of strongest CFs, but not of weaker CFs, were significantly smaller in PCs sampled from Sort1 knockdown regions (Figure 4F). To test the possibility that Sort1 is a functional progranulin receptor in CFs, we compared the effect of Sort1 knockdown in CFs between WT and Grn-cKO mice. We found no differences between the two groups in terms of the effect on CF synapse elimination (Figures 4G and 4H) and the amplitude of the strongest CF-EPSCs (Figure 4I). These results clearly show that the effect of Sort1 knockdown in CFs is occluded by progranulin deletion in PCs. We then examined whether the level of Sort1 expression in CFs is a determinant of survival or elimination of CFs. We did not find clear difference in the percentage of CF terminals with Sort1 immunoreactivity between those on the soma and on the dendrites (Figures S4G and S4H). However, when Sort1 was overexpressed in CFs together with EGFP, such CFs were more likely to be maintained (Figures 4J and 4K). We first confirmed that the percentage of synaptic terminals with Sort1 immunoreactivity was significantly increased in CFs with Sort1 overexpression compared to control CFs (Figures S4G and S4H). We found that PCs surrounded by CFs with Sort1 overexpression were innervated by a significantly larger number of CFs than PCs surrounded by CFs without Sort1 overexpression (Figures 4J and 4K). Moreover, the EPSC amplitudes for weaker CFs that were considered to innervate the soma were significantly increased when Sort1 was overexpressed (Figure 4L). In contrast, those for the strongest CFs that were considered to innervate the soma and dendrites were unchanged even with Sort1 overexpression (Figure 4L), presumably because endogenous Sort1 may be sufficient for supporting the strongest CFs. These results suggest that CFs bearing fewer Sort1-positive presynaptic terminals and/or CFs bearing terminals with lower Sort1 expression are prone to be eliminated, whereas CFs bearing more Sort1-positive terminals and/or CFs bearing terminals with higher Sort1 expression are likely to be maintained. Therefore, progranulin from postsynaptic PCs is thought to stabilize both somatic and dendritic CF synaptic contacts by retrogradely acting on Sort1. However, presumably because elimination signals preferentially attack somatic CF synapses, progranulin appears to contribute eventually to the selective strengthening and dendritic translocation of the strongest CFs. CF synapse elimination in the cerebellum is a representative model of neural circuit refinement during postnatal development (Hashimoto and Kano, 2013Hashimoto K. Kano M. Synapse elimination in the developing cerebellum.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 4667-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mechanisms underlying the elimination of redundant CFs have been studied extensively and a number of molecules involved in this process have been identified. For example, P/Q-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (VDCC) (Hashimoto et al., 2011Hashimoto K. Tsujita M. Miyazaki T. Kitamura K. Yamazaki M. Shin H.S. Watanabe M. Sakimura K. Kano M.

In contrast, distinct mechanisms are considered to be involved in selective strengthening of single CFs and their dendritic translocation. Ca2+ influx through P/Q-type VDCC to PCs is essential for these processes (Hashimoto et al., 2011Hashimoto K. Tsujita M. Miyazaki T. Kitamura K. Yamazaki M. Shin H.S. Watanabe M. Sakimura K. Kano M.

https://openalex.org/W2791002723,"Background and aim In the last few decades, the prevalence of hypertension has been drastically increased in India. The present study estimates the current prevalence of hypertension and its correlates in the state of Maharashtra. The variation in the prevalence of hypertension associated with individual-level characteristics is explained at the community and district level. Methods Data is used from the recent round of District Level Household & Facility Survey (DLHS-4), 2012–13. The DLHS-4 has used the nationally representative sample, collected through multistage stratified sampling procedure. A similar sampling frame, used in NSSO-2007-08, has been followed. The chi-square test is used to show the significance level of the association between the estimated prevalence of hypertension and its correlates. Multilevel regression analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of individual and community level factors on the prevalence of hypertension. Results The overall prevalence of hypertension is 25% in Maharashtra, and a huge variation in the prevalence of hypertension is found across the districts. Dhule, Gadchiroli (with a low HDI rank), Mumbai and Satara (with higher HDI rank) are the districts with the higher (above 30%) prevalence of high blood pressure. The prevalence also significantly varies according to different correlates. The prevalence of high blood pressure is higher among elderly population (40%), among males (28%), in the urban areas (27%) and in the richest wealth quintile (28%). The prevalence is also higher among cigarette smokers (31%), alcohol consumers (30%) and people with obesity (38%) as compared to their counterparts. The results of the multilevel analysis show that the older and obese persons are at four-time higher risk of hypertension. Again, age, sex, marital status, place of residence, wealth status, unhealthy habits (i.e. smoking and alcohol consumption) and BMI are significantly associated with hypertension. The results of VPC statistics show that 14% of hypertension prevalence could be attributed to differences at the community level. Conclusion The prevalence of hypertension largely varies in the districts of Maharashtra irrespective of their level of socio-economic development (i.e. HDI rank). The variation in the rate of prevalence of hypertension is higher in the community (PSU) level as compared to the variation in the prevalence rate at the district level. Hypertension is attributable to the modifiable factors like risky lifestyle practices."
https://openalex.org/W2793748604,"Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are an abundant class of innate T cells restricted by the MHC I-related molecule MR1. MAIT cells can recognize bacterially-derived metabolic intermediates from the riboflavin pathway presented by MR1 and are postulated to play a role in innate antibacterial immunity through production of cytokines and direct bacterial killing. MR1 tetramers, typically stabilized by the adduct of 5-amino-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-A-RU) and methylglyoxal (MeG), are important tools for the study of MAIT cells. A long-standing problem with 5-A-RU is that it is unstable upon storage. Herein we report an efficient synthetic approach to the HCl salt of this ligand, which has improved stability during storage. We also show that synthetic 5-A-RU•HCl produced by this method may be used in protocols for the stimulation of human MAIT cells and production of both human and mouse MR1 tetramers for MAIT cell identification."
https://openalex.org/W2790839052,"For many species and seed sources used in restoration activities, specific seed germination requirements are often unknown. Because seed dormancy and germination traits can be constrained by phylogenetic history, related species are often assumed to have similar traits. However, significant variation in these traits is also present within species as a result of adaptation to local climatic conditions. A growing number of studies have attempted to disentangle how phylogeny and climate influence seed dormancy and germination traits, but they have focused primarily on species-level effects, ignoring potential population-level variation. We examined the relationships between phylogeny, climate, and seed dormancy and germination traits for 24 populations of eight native, restoration-relevant forb species found in a wide range of climatic conditions in the Southwest United States. The seeds were exposed to eight temperature and stratification length regimes designed to mimic regional climatic conditions. Phylogenetic relatedness, overall climatic conditions, and temperature conditions at the site were all significantly correlated with final germination response, with significant among-population variation in germination response across incubation treatments for seven of our eight study species. Notably, germination during stratification was significantly predicted by precipitation seasonality and differed significantly among populations for seven species. While previous studies have not examined germination during stratification as a potential trait influencing overall germination response, our results suggest that this trait should be included in germination studies as well as seed sourcing decisions. Results of this study deepen our understanding of the relationships between source climate, species identity, and germination, leading to improved seed sourcing decisions for restorations."
https://openalex.org/W2790225700,"To explore the effect of expressive writing of positive emotions on test anxiety among senior-high-school students.The Test Anxiety Scale (TAS) was used to assess the anxiety level of 200 senior-high-school students. Seventy-five students with high anxiety were recruited and divided randomly into experimental and control groups. Each day for 30 days, the experimental group engaged in 20 minutes of expressive writing of positive emotions, while the control group was asked to merely write down their daily events. A second test was given after the month-long experiment to analyze whether there had been a reduction in anxiety among the sample. Quantitative data was obtained from TAS scores. The NVivo10.0 software program was used to examine the frequency of particular word categories used in participants' writing manuscripts.Senior-high-school students indicated moderate to high test anxiety. There was a significant difference in post-test results (P < 0.001), with the experimental group scoring obviously lower than the control group. The interaction effect of group and gender in the post-test results was non-significant (P > 0.05). Students' writing manuscripts were mainly encoded on five code categories: cause, anxiety manifestation, positive emotion, insight and evaluation. There was a negative relation between positive emotion, insight codes and test anxiety. There were significant differences in the positive emotion, anxiety manifestation, and insight code categories between the first 10 days' manuscripts and the last 10 days' ones.Long-term expressive writing of positive emotions appears to help reduce test anxiety by using insight and positive emotion words for Chinese students. Efficient and effective intervention programs to ease test anxiety can be designed based on this study."
https://openalex.org/W2785348072,"Background Accessibility and affordability of evidence-based medicines are issues of global concern. For low-income countries like Nepal, it is crucial to have easy and reliable access to affordable, good-quality, evidence-based medicines, especially in the aftermath of natural or manmade disasters. Availability of affordable and evidence-based high quality medicines depends on the medicine procurement procedure, which makes it an important aspect of healthcare delivery. In this study, we aimed to investigate medicine procurement practices in hospital pharmacies of Nepal within the framework of International Pharmaceutical Federation [FIP] hospital pharmacy guidelines “the Basel Statements”. Method We conducted semi-structured interviews with hospital pharmacists or procurement officers in hospital pharmacies of four major regions in Nepal to explore procurement practices. Data were collected until saturation of themes, analysed using the framework approach, and organised around the statements within the procurement theme of the Basel Statements. Results Interviews conducted with 53 participants revealed that the procurement guidelines of the Basel Statements were adopted to a certain extent in hospital pharmacies of Nepal. It was found that the majority of hospital pharmacies in Nepal reported using an expensive direct-procurement model for purchasing medicines. Most had no formulary and procured medicines solely based on doctors’ prescriptions, which were heavily influenced by pharmaceutical companies’ marketing strategies. Whilst most procured only registered medicines, a minority reported purchasing unregistered medicines through unauthorised supply-chains. And although the majority of hospital pharmacies had some contingency plans for managing medicine shortages, a few had none. Conclusions Procurement guidelines of the Basel Statements were thus found to be partially adopted; however, there is room for improvement in current procurement practices in hospital pharmacies of Nepal. Adoption and regulation of national and international policies is recommended for enhancing medicine accessibility, as well as improving preparedness for health emergencies during natural disasters and health epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W2787688604,"Due to recent large outbreaks, peanuts have been considered a product of potential risk for Salmonella. Usually, peanut products show a low water activity (aw) and high fat content, which contribute to increasing the thermal resistance and survival of Salmonella. This study evaluated the long-term kinetics of Salmonella survival on different peanut products under storage at 28°C for 420 days. Samples of raw in-shell peanuts (aw = 0.29), roasted peanuts (aw = 0.39), unblanched peanut kernel (aw = 0.54), peanut brittle (aw = 0.30), paçoca (aw = 0.40) and pé-de-moça (aw = 0.68) were inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028 at two inoculum levels (3 and 6 log cfu/ g). The Salmonella behavior was influenced (p<0.05) by aw, lipid, carbohydrate and protein content. In most cases for both inoculum levels, the greatest reductions were seen after the first two weeks of storage, followed by a slower decline phase. The lowest reductions were verified in paçoca and roasted peanuts, with counts of 1.01 and 0.87 log cfu/ g at low inoculum level and 2.53 and 3.82 log cfu/ g at high inoculum level at the end of the storage time. The highest loss of viability was observed in pé-de-moça, with absence of Salmonella in 10-g after 180 days at low inoculum level. The Weibull model provided a suitable fit to the data (R2≥0.81), with δ value ranging from 0.06 to 49.75 days. Therefore, the results demonstrated that Salmonella survives longer in peanut products, beyond the shelf life (>420 days), especially in products with aw around 0.40."
https://openalex.org/W2790942390,"The salmon louse is a marine ectoparasitic copepod on salmonid fishes. Its lifecycle consists of eight developmental stages, each separated by a molt. In crustaceans and insects, molting and reproduction is controlled by circulating steroid hormones such as 20-hydroxyecdysone. Steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol through catalytic reactions involving a 7,8-dehydrogenase Neverland and several cytochrome P450 genes collectively called the Halloween genes. In this study, we have isolated and identified orthologs of neverland, disembodied and shade in the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) genome. Tissue-specific expression analysis show that the genes are expressed in intestine and reproductive tissue. In addition, levels of the steroid hormones ecdysone, 20-hydroxyecdysone and ponasterone A were measured during the reproductive stage of adult females and in early life stages."

We conducted a retrospective cohort trial to assess the clinical value of circulating cell-free DNA concentration and integrity index for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. A total of 150 patients were recruited. Plasma samples of 24 ovarian cancer patients, 12 benign ovarian cysts, and 12 healthy controls were assessed. By amplifying short ALU-115 repeat and long ALU-219 fragments, circulating cell-free DNA concentrations and integrity index were measured. Plasma ALU-219 fragment levels and integrity index were significantly higher in the ovarian cancer group compared with the benign disease and healthy control groups (p = 0.023 and p = 0.004, respectively). These findings indicated that plasma ALU-219 levels and integrity may have a clinical value in the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2793870400,"Background The 2009 World Health Organisation (WHO) surgical safety checklist significantly reduces surgical mortality and morbidity (up to 47%). Yet in 2016, only 25% of East African anesthetists regularly use the checklist. Nationwide implementation of the checklist is reported in high-income countries, but in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) reports of successful implementations are sparse, limited to single institutions and require intensive support. Since checklist use leads to the biggest improvements in outcomes in LMICs, methods of wide-scale implementation are needed. We hypothesized that, using a three-day course, successful wide-scale implementation of the checklist could be achieved, as measured by at least 50% compliance with six basic safety processes at three to four months. We also aimed to determine predictors for checklist utilization. Materials and methods Using a blended educational implementation strategy based on prior pilot studies we designed a three-day dynamic educational course to facilitate widespread implementation of the WHO checklist. The course utilized lectures, film, small group breakouts, participant feedback and simulation to teach the knowledge, skills and behavior changes needed to implement the checklist. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and local hospital leadership, the course was delivered to 427 multi-disciplinary staff at 21 hospitals located in 19 of 22 regions of Madagascar between September 2015 and March 2016. We evaluated implementation at three to four months using questionnaires (with a 5-point Likert scale) and focus groups. Multivariate linear regression was used to test predictors of checklist utilization. Results At three to four months, 65% of respondents reported always using the checklist, with another 13% using it in part. Participant’s years in practice, hospital size, or surgical volume did not predict checklist use. Checklist use was associated with counting instruments (p< 0.05), but not with verifying: patient identity, difficult intubation risk, risk of blood loss, prophylactic antibiotic administration, or counting needles and sponges. Conclusion Use of a multi-disciplinary three-day course for checklist implementation resulted in 78% of participants using the checklist, at three months; and an increase in counting surgical instruments. Successful checklist implementation was not predicted by participant length of medical service, hospital size or surgical volume. If reproducible in other countries, widespread implementation in LMICs becomes a realistic possibility."
https://openalex.org/W2791238921,"It remains controversial whether measures of general or abdominal adiposity are better risk predictors for ischemic stroke. Furthermore, so far it is unclear whether body fat mass index (BFMI) and fat free mass index (FFMI) are risk predictors for ischemic stroke. This study examined the sex-specific relevance of body mass index (BMI), BROCA Index, waist circumference (WC), waist-height ratio (WHtR), BFMI and FFMI for the development of ischemic stroke in a Caucasian population.The prospective population-based cohort study was based on 1917 men and 1832 women (aged 50 to 74 years) who participated in the third (1994/95) or fourth (1999/2001) MONICA/KORA Augsburg survey. Subjects were free of stroke at baseline. Standardized anthropometric and bioelectric impedance measurements were obtained at baseline. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated from Cox proportional hazard models.During a median follow-up of 9.3 years 128 ischemic strokes occurred in men and 81 in women, respectively. Coded as quartiles WC and WHtR were significantly associated with incident stroke in multivariable analyses in women (comparing the 4th vs. the bottom quartile), but none of the adiposity measures was significantly associated with incident stroke in multivariable adjusted analyses in men. When anthropometric measures were used as continuous variables, these findings were confirmed. After multivariable adjustment the associations between obesity measures and incident ischemic stroke were statistically significant only for WC (HR 1.39, 95%CI 1.12-1.72) and WHtR in women (HR 1.39, 95%CI 1.12-1.73) per increase of 1 standard deviation. In both sexes the measures BFMI and FFMI were no independent predictors for incident ischemic stroke.Abdominal obesity measures are independent predictors of incident ischemic stroke in women but not in men from the general adult population. Thus, it may be of particular importance for women to prevent central obesity in order to reduce their risk of ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2791055636,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system regulate p53, caspase and Bcl-2 family proteins, and is crucial for the degradation of the defective germ cells in testes. Purpose: to evaluate the concentration of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1 (UCHL1) in the blood plasma of boys with cryptorchidism and if there is any correlation with patient age.Patients-50 boys aged 1-4 years (median = 2,4y.) with unilateral cryptorchidism. Exclusion criteria were: previous human chorionic gonadotropin treatment, an abnormal karyotype, endocrine or immunological disorders or any long-term medication. The control group-50 healthy, age matched boys (aged 1-4 years, median = 2,1y.), admitted to the Pediatric Surgery Department for planned herniotomy. To investigate UCHL1 in blood plasma of boys with cryptorchidism, we used a novel technique Surface PLASMON RESONANCE Imaging (SPRI).The median concentration of UCHL1 in the blood plasma of boys with cryptorchidism, was 5-folds higher than in boys with inguinal hernia, whose testicles were located in the scrotum. We also noticed statistically significant difference between UCHL1 levels in boys with cryptorchidism up to 2 years old, and above 2 years old. Older boys, whose testicles since birth were located in the inguinal pouch or in the abdominal cavity, had higher concentration of UCHL1 in their blood plasma, than boys from younger group. In the group of cryptorchid boys, we also found slightly lower concentrations of INSL3, without statistical significance and no correlation with UCHL1 levels.Uchl1 concentrations in the blood plasma of boys with cryptorchidism, may reflect the heat-induced apoptosis of germ cells. Higher UCHL1 concentrations in older boys with undescended testicles, probably express intensity of germ cell apoptosis, more extensive when testicles are subjected to heat-stress for longer period. Further analyses of UCHL1 may help to elucidate its role in mechanisms influencing spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2790304050,"Manual action verbs modulate the right-hand grip force in right-handed subjects. However, to our knowledge, no studies demonstrate the ability to accomplish this modulation during bimanual tasks nor describe their effect on left-hand behavior in unimanual and bimanual tasks. Using load cells and word playlists, we evaluated the occurrence of grip force modulation by manual action verbs in unimanual and symmetrical bimanual tasks across the three auditory processing phases. We found a significant grip force increase for all conditions compared to baseline, indicating the occurrence of modulation. When compared to each other, the grip force variation from baseline for the three phases of both hands in the symmetrical bimanual task was not different from the right-hand in the unimanual task. The left-hand grip force showed a lower amplitude for auditory phases 1 and 2 when compared to the other conditions. The right-hand grip force modulation became significant from baseline at 220 ms after the word onset in the unimanual task. This moment occurred earlier for both hands in bimanual task (160 ms for the right-hand and 180 for the left-hand). It occurred later for the left-hand in unimanual task (320 ms). We discuss the hypothesis that Broca's area and Broca's homologue area likely control the left-hand modulation in a unilateral or a bilateral fashion. These results provide new evidence for understanding the linguistic function processing in both hemispheres."
https://openalex.org/W2792759045,"The aim of the present study was to identify the peri-implant conditions (bleeding on probing (BOP), pocket probing depth (PPD), modified plaque index (mPI)) and marginal bone loss (MBL, marginal bone level change between follow-up and occlusal loading) around cemented and screw-retained posterior single crowns on tissue-level implants. The study was a retrospective cohort study with up to 4 years (mean 2.5 years) follow-up. Patients with either cemented or screw-retained crowns in posterior regions were included. Implant survival, technical complications, BOP, PPD, mPI, MBL, biologic complications (peri-implant mocositis and peri-implantitis) were evaluated. Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the difference between the screw-retained group (SG) and cemented group (CG). 176 patients (SG: 94, CG: 82) were included. The implant survival rates were 100% in SG and 98.8% in CG. Prosthetic screw loosening was found in 8 restorations (8.7%) at follow-up visit. Peri-implant mucositis rate was significantly higher in the SG group (42.1%) than that in the CG group (32.2%) (P = 0.04). Six patients (6.38%) in the screw-retained group and 5 patients (6.10%) in the cemented group were diagnosed with peri-implantitis, the difference did not reach statistical significance (P>0.05). No significant difference of PPD, mPI and MBL were found between two groups (P = 0.11, 0.13 and 0.08, respectively). High implant survival rates were achieved in both groups. Cemented single crowns on tissue-level implants showed comparable peri-implant conditions in comparison with two-piece screw-retained crowns. Well-designed prospective cohort or randomized controlled clinical trials with longer follow-up are needed to confirm the result."
https://openalex.org/W2792921223,"Tuberculosis (TB), with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as the causative agent, remains to be a serious world health problem. Traditional methods used for the study of Mtb in the lungs of TB patients do not provide information about the number and functional status of Mtb, especially if Mtb are located in alveolar macrophages. We have developed a technique to produce ex vivo cultures of cells from different parts of lung tissues surgically removed from patients with pulmonary TB and compared data on the number of cells with Mtb inferred by the proposed technique to the results of bacteriological and histological analyses used for examination of the resected lungs. The ex vivo cultures of cells obtained from the resected lungs of all patients were largely composed of CD14-positive alveolar macrophages, foamy or not, with or without Mtb. Lymphocytes, fibroblasts, neutrophils, and multinucleate Langhans giant cells were also observed. We found alveolar macrophages with Mtb in the ex vivo cultures of cells from the resected lungs of even those TB patients, whose sputum smears and lung tissues did not contain acid-fast Mtb or reveal growing Mtb colonies on dense medium. The detection of alveolar macrophages with Mtb in ex vivo culture as soon as 16–18 h after isolation of cells from the resected lungs of all TB patients suggests that the technique proposed for assessing the level of infection in alveolar macrophages of TB patients has higher sensitivity than do prolonged bacteriological or pathomorphological methods. The proposed technique allowed us to rapidly (in two days after surgery) determine the level of infection with Mtb in the cells of the resected lungs of TB patients and, by the presence or absence of Mtb colonies, including those with cording morphology, the functional status of the TB agent at the time of surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2791887196,"For successful growth and maintenance of primary myogenic cells in vitro, culture medium and addition of sera are the most important factors. At present it is not established as to what extent sera of different origin and composition, supplemented in media or serum-free media conditions influence myoblast function and responses to different stimuli. By assessing markers of proliferation, differentiation/fusion, quiescence, apoptosis and protein synthesis the aim of the current study was to elucidate how primary human myoblasts and myotubes are modulated by different commonly used serum using FCS (foetal calf serum), (CS-FCS charcoal-stripped FCS, a manufacturing process to remove hormones and growth factors from sera), HS (horse serum) as well as in serum free conditions (DMEM). To characterise the biological impact of the different serum, myoblasts were stimulated with Insulin (100 nM) and Vitamin D (100 nM; 1α,25(OH)2D3, 1α,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol, Calcitriol), two factors with characterised effects on promoting fusion and protein synthesis or quiescence, respectively in human myoblasts/myotubes. We demonstrate that sera of different origin/formulation differentially affect myoblast proliferation and myotube protein synthesis. Importantly, we showed that quantifying the extent to which Insulin effects myoblasts in vitro is highly dependent upon serum addition and which type is present in the media. Upregulation of mRNA markers for myogenic fusion, Myogenin, with Insulin stimulation, relative to DMEM, appeared dampened at varying degrees with serum addition and effects on p70S6K phosphorylation as a marker of protein synthesis could not be identified unless serum was removed from media. We propose that these asymmetric molecular and biochemical responses in human myoblasts reflect the variable composition of mitogenic and anabolic factors in each of the sera. The results have implications for both the reproducibility and interpretation of results from experimental models in myoblast cells/myotubes."
