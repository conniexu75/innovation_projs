https://openalex.org/W2048421180,"Glasses can be formed by many routes. In some cases, distinct polyamorphic forms are found. The normal mode of glass formation is cooling of a viscous liquid. Liquid behavior during cooling is classified between ""strong"" and ""fragile,"" and the three canonical characteristics of relaxing liquids are correlated through the fragility. Strong liquids become fragile liquids on compression. In some cases, such conversions occur during cooling by a weak first-order transition. This behavior can be related to the polymorphism in a glass state through a recent simple modification of the van der Waals model for tetrahedrally bonded liquids. The sudden loss of some liquid degrees of freedom through such first-order transitions is suggestive of the polyamorphic transition between native and denatured hydrated proteins, which can be interpreted as single-chain glass-forming polymers plasticized by water and cross-linked by hydrogen bonds. The onset of a sharp change in d〈r2〉/dT(〈r2〉 is the Debye-Waller factor and T is temperature) in proteins, which is controversially indentified with the glass transition in liquids, is shown to be general for glass formers and observable in computer simulations of strong and fragile ionic liquids, where it proves to be close to the experimental glass transition temperature. The latter may originate in strong anharmonicity in modes (""bosons""), which permits the system to access multiple minima of its configuration space. These modes, the Kauzmann temperature TK, and the fragility of the liquid, may thus be connected."

The metallic glasses, which exist in a very wide variety of compositions, combine fundamental interest with practical applications. They also serve as precursors for exciting new nanocrystalline materials. Their magnetic (soft and hard) and mechanical properties are of particular interest."
https://openalex.org/W1991549842,"Forest fragmentation, the disruption in the continuity of forest habitat, is hypothesized to be a major cause of population decline for some species of forest birds because fragmentation reduces nesting (reproductive) success. Nest predation and parasitism by cowbirds increased with forest fragmentation in nine midwestern (United States) landscapes that varied from 6 to 95 percent forest cover within a 10-kilometer radius of the study areas. Observed reproductive rates were low enough for some species in the most fragmented landscapes to suggest that their populations are sinks that depend for perpetuation on immigration from reproductive source populations in landscapes with more extensive forest cover. Conservation strategies should consider preservation and restoration of large, unfragmented ""core"" areas in each region."
https://openalex.org/W1997676547,"Various static and dynamic phenomena displayed by glass-forming liquids, particularly those near the so-called ""fragile"" limit, emerge as manifestations of the multidimensional complex topography of the collective potential energy function. These include non-Arrhenius viscosity and relaxation times, bifurcation between the alpha- and beta-relaxation processes, and a breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation for self-diffusion. This multidimensional viewpoint also produces an extension of the venerable Lindemann melting criterion and provides a critical evaluation of the popular ""ideal glass state"" concept."
https://openalex.org/W2094392026,"The polar ice sheets are rich sources of information on past atmospheric conditions, including paleoclimates. A new deep ice core has been drilled in south Greenland. Comparison of the oxygen isotopic profile with that from Camp Century and with a deep-sea foraminifera record indicates that the new core reaches back to about 90,000 years before present in a continuous sequence. The details in the Wisconsin part of the ice core records seem to be climatically significant, and the general trends reveal all of the relevant Emiliani stages recorded in deep-sea cores. The redated Camp Century record suggests a dramatic termination of the Eem/Sangamon interglacial."
https://openalex.org/W2054163385,"Physical aging refers to structural relaxation of the glassy state toward the metastable equilibrium amorphous state, and it is accompanied by changes in almost all physical properties. These changes, which must be taken into account in the design, manufacture, and use of glassy polymer materials and devices, present a daunting challenge to theorists."
https://openalex.org/W2092015963,"Recent neutron scattering experiments on the microscopic dynamics of polymers below and above the glass transition temperature T(g) are reviewed. The results presented cover different dynamic processes appearing in glasses: local motions, vibrations, and different relaxation processes such as alpha- and beta-relaxation. For the alpha-relaxation, which occurs above T(g), it is possible to extend the time-temperature superposition principle, which is valid for polymers on a macroscopic scale, to the microscopic time scale. However, this principle is not applicable for temperatures approaching T(g). Below T(g), an inelastic excitation at a frequency of some hundred gigahertz (on the order of several wave numbers), the ""boson peak,"" survives from a quasi-elastic overdamped scattering law at high temperatures. The connection between this boson peak and the fast dynamic process appearing near T(g) is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2012604167,"Operating lifetime is the main problem that complicates the use of polymeric light-emitting diodes (LEDs). A class of electron transport (ET) polymers [poly(aryl acrylate) and poly(aryl ether)s] is reported in which moieties with high electron affinities are covalently attached to stable polymer backbones. Devices based on poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) prepared with these materials exhibited a 30-fold improvement in stability and, in one case, dramatically lower (10 volts versus about 30 volts) operating voltage relative to those having conventional ET layers. The current-carrying capacity of indium tin oxide-PPV-polymeric ET layer-aluminum LEDs was also increased by a factor of 30. These improvements lead to an enhancement in power efficiency of nearly an order of magnitude. Choosing polymers with high glass transition temperatures increases device lifetime."
https://openalex.org/W2087074994,"A first principles theoretical approach shows that, at the density of the inner core, both hexagonal [hexagonal close-packed (hcp)] and cubic [face-centered-cubic (fcc)] phases of iron are substantially elastically anisotropic. A forward model of the inner core based on the predicted elastic constants and the assumption that the inner core consists of a nearly perfectly aligned aggregate of hcp crystals shows good agreement with seismic travel time anomalies that have been attributed to inner core anisotropy. A cylindrically averaged aggregate of fcc crystals disagrees with the seismic observations."
https://openalex.org/W2050326201,"Ensembles of defect-free InAIAs islands of ultrasmall dimensions embedded in AIGaAs have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Cathodoluminescence was used to directly image the spatial distribution of the quantum dots by mapping their luminescence and to spectrally resolve very sharp peaks from small groups of dots, thus providing experimental verification for the discrete density of states in a zero-dimensional quantum structure. Visible luminescence is produced by different nominal compositions of InxAI(1-x)As-AIyGa(1-y)As."
https://openalex.org/W2047603313,"The treatment of agricultural soils with CH(3)Br (MeBr) has been suggested to be a significant source of atmospheric MeBr which is involved in stratospheric ozone loss. A field fumigation experiment showed that, after 7 days, 34 percent of the applied MeBr had escaped into the atmosphere. The remaining 66 percent should have caused an increase in bromide in the soil; soil bromide increased by an amount equal to 70 percent of the applied MeBr, consistent with the flux measurements to within 4 percent. Comparison with an earlier experiment in which the escape of MeBr to the atmosphere was greater showed that higher soil pH, organic content and soil moisture, and deeper, more uniform injection of MeBr may in combination reduce the escape of MeBr."

https://openalex.org/W2097225864,"Yale University intends to issue a statement of policy governing the nature and extent of university and faculty involvement in the commercial application of scientific research. This policy will be based on the university's principles of openness and free dissemination of ideas, and will recognize the need of profit-oriented companies to treat knowledge as private property. The university will continue to allow relationships between faculty members and commercial companies, even in arrangements involving university-based results, but a faculty member who goes beyond any reasonable definition of ""consulting"" may be asked to take an unpaid leave of absence or to sever his or her ties with the university. While a university should not ignore the potential availability of funds from commercial sponsors, neither should it be driven to arrangements that are not compatible with the norms and mission of the university."
https://openalex.org/W2087415640,"Oriented drill cores retrieved from active massive sulfide edifices at the Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge contain an abundance of fossilized tube structures associated with vestimentiferan and annelid worms. The petrological evolution of these biogeological structures and their presence deep inside the edifice walls demonstrate that an initial, worm-mediated texture directly affects the subsequent steps of inorganic precipitation, wall infilling, and outward growth of these black smoker deposits. The presence of fossilized structures in hydrothermal discharge sites that are 2 kilometers apart and their similarity to structures observed in other modern and ancient deposits suggest that these biogeological processes are general phenomena."

The APS will be the world`s brightest source of hard x-rays, initiating diverse new research efforts. The spark behind all the research is synchrotron radiations - the narrow cone of illumination given off by charged particles moving at nearly the speed of light when they are forced to change direction. The higher the energy of the particles, the narrower the cone angle and the shorter the average wavelength in the bundle of radiation. Discussed in detail are the new generation of sources, APS and European and Japanese competitors and the research arising from them."
https://openalex.org/W2060020128,"After more than 25 years of development of nuclear power and almost 10 years of research and development in numerous areas of nonnuclear energy, there is now a good basis for judging the future prospects of energy technologies in the Federal Republic of Germany. The development of nuclear power has provided an important and economically advantageous new source of energy. Further efforts are needed to establish the nuclear fuel cycle in all stages and to exploit the potential of advanced reactors. In all other areas of energy technology, including energy conservation, new energy sources, and coal, economics has turned out to be the key problem, even at today's energy prices. Opportunities to overcome these economic problems through additional R & D are limited. There is some potential for special applications, and there are many technologies that could contribute to the energy supply of developing countries. In general, however, progress in energy conservation and the use of renewable energy sources will depend on the degree to which energy policy measures can improve their economic basis. For some technologies, such as solar thermal power stations and coal liquefaction, large-scale economic deployment cannot be foreseen today. Instead of establishing costly demonstration projects, emphasis will be put on improving key components of these technologies with the aim of having the most advanced technology available when the economic parameters are more favorable."
