https://openalex.org/W2017175357,"It is unknown when life first appeared on Earth. The earliest known microfossils (approximately 3,500 Myr before present) are structurally complex, and if it is assumed that the associated organisms required a long time to develop this degree of complexity, then the existence of life much earlier than this can be argued. But the known examples of crustal rocks older than 3,500 Myr have experienced intense metamorphism, which would have obliterated any fragile microfossils contained therein. It is therefore necessary to search for geochemical evidence of past biotic activity that has been preserved within minerals that are resistant to metamorphism. Here we report ion-microprobe measurements of the carbon-isotope composition of carbonaceous inclusions within grains of apatite (basic calcium phosphate) from the oldest known sediment sequences--a approximately 3,800-Myr-old banded iron formation from the Isua supracrustal belt, West Greenland, and a similar formation from the nearby Akilia island that is possibly older than 3,850 Myr. The carbon in the carbonaceous inclusions is isotopically light, indicative of biological activity; no known abiotic process can explain the data. Unless some unknown abiotic process exists which is able both to create such isotopically light carbon and then selectively incorporate it into apatite grains, our results provide evidence for the emergence of life on Earth by at least 3,800 Myr before present."

https://openalex.org/W2020329201,"The entry of RNA polymerase II into a productive mode of elongation is controlled, in part, by the postinitiation activity of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) (Marshall, N. F., and Price, D. H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 12335-12338). We report here that removal of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II abolishes productive elongation. Correspondingly, we found that P-TEFb can phosphorylate the CTD of pure RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, P-TEFb can phosphorylate the CTD of RNA polymerase II when the polymerase is in an early elongation complex. Both the function and kinase activity of P-TEFb are blocked by the drugs 5, 6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) and H-8. P-TEFb is distinct from transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) because the two factors have no subunits in common, P-TEFb is more sensitive to DRB than is TFIIH, and most importantly, TFIIH cannot substitute functionally for P-TEFb. We propose that phosphorylation of the CTD by P-TEFb controls the transition from abortive into productive elongation mode."
https://openalex.org/W1980548664,"We are able to move visual attention away from the direction of gaze, fixating on one object while attending to something else at a different location, within the region of peripheral vision. It has been widely assumed that the attentional neural systems are separate from the motor systems, but some studies challenge this idea. It has now been suggested that the attentional system is part of the premotor processing in the brain. This model proposes that attentional processes evolved as part of the motor systems, with isolated attentional shifts representing an artificial separation of a natural linkage. Here we test how attentional shifts might be linked to the preparations for making saccadic eye movements. We studied the superior colliculus in monkeys as they shifted their attention during different tasks, and found that each attentional shift is associated with eye-movement preparation."

https://openalex.org/W2165303514,"In a model of ocean-atmosphere interaction that excluded biological processes, the oceanic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) was substantially reduced in scenarios involving global warming relative to control scenarios. The primary reason for the reduced uptake was the weakening or collapse of the ocean thermohaline circulation. Such a large reduction in this ocean uptake would have a major impact on the future growth rate of atmospheric CO2. Model simulations that include a simple representation of biological processes show a potentially large offsetting effect resulting from the downward flux of biogenic carbon. However, the magnitude of the offset is difficult to quantify with present knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2086493438,"Recent evidence suggests that CPP32 is an essential component of an aspartate-specific cysteine protease (ASCP) cascade responsible for apoptosis execution in mammalian cells. Activation of CPP32 could lead to activation of other downstream ASCPs, resulting in late morphological changes such as lamin cleavage and DNA fragmentation, observed in cells undergoing apoptosis. Here we describe the identification and cloning of a novel human ASCP named Mch6 from Jurkat T lymphocytes. We demonstrate that the pro-enzymes of Mch6 and the lamin-cleaving enzyme Mch2α are substrates for mature CPP32. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that CPP32 processes pro-Mch6 preferentially at Asp330 to generate two subunits of molecular masses 37 kDa (p37) and 10 kDa (p10). However, CPP32 processes pro-Mch2α at three aspartate processing sites (Asp23, Asp179, and Asp193) to produce the large (p18) and small (p11) subunits of the mature Mch2α enzyme. The CPP32-processed Mch2α is capable of cleaving the VEIDN lamin cleavage site, indicating that CPP32 can, in fact, activate pro-Mch2α. Granzyme B at a concentration that allows processing and activation of CPP32 failed to process pro-Mch2α. However, incubation of pro-Mch2α with granzyme B in the presence of a cellular extract containing pro-CPP32 resulted in activation of pro-CPP32 and subsequent processing of pro-Mch2α. Interestingly, granzyme B can also process pro-Mch6 but at a site N-terminal to that cleaved by CPP32. These data suggest that Mch2α and Mch6 are downstream proteases activated in CPP32- and granzyme B-mediated apoptosis. This is the first demonstration of a protease cascade involving granzyme B, CPP32, Mch2α, and Mch6 and evidence that the lamin-cleaving enzyme Mch2 is a target of mature CPP32.

The prototype of this family is the interleukin 1β converting enzyme (ICE), which exists as a 45-kDa pro-enzyme and is cleaved to form two subunits (p20 and p10), which associate as a tetramer (p20)2/(p10)2 to form the active enzyme (5Walker N.P.C.

ICE bears no resemblance structurally to other known cysteine proteases and is unique in its substrate specificity in that it cleaves after certain aspartates. In light of the homology to Ced-3, an expanded role for ASCPs as positive regulators of apoptosis was hypothesized and subsequently supported when it was shown that overexpression of ICE in fibroblasts resulted in their death by apoptosis (7Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). This process could be blocked by crmA (a specific viral inhibitor of ICE) or the Bcl-2 proto-oncogene product. Several new members of this family have been described recently, including CPP32 (8Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Like ICE, all of these enzymes require processing to large and small subunits for activity, cleave after specific aspartates, and possess the unique and highly conserved pentapeptide active site containing an essential cysteine. Like Ced-3, overexpression of these ICE homologs is capable of inducing apoptosis in various in vivo models. aspartate-specific cysteine protease interleukin 1β converting enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase mammalian ced-3 homolog 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamino]-1-propanesulfonate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction DEVD-aldehyde. Granzyme B is a cytoplasmic granule-associated serine protease expressed by cytotoxic T and natural killer cells and is the only other enzyme with similar substrate specificity to ASCPs (18Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 202-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Release of granzyme B by these cells has been shown to be essential for rapid degradation of DNA and induction of apoptosis in susceptible target cells (19Shi L. Kraut R.P. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 175: 553-566Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar). It now appears that this activity may be mediated, at least in part, by multiple ASCPs that are activated by granzyme B (13Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Although ASCPs appear to play fundamental roles in inflammation and apoptosis, their individual contribution to the apoptosis mechanism is not yet clear. Additionally, their mechanism of activation, enzymatic specificity, and physiologically relevant apoptotic substrates remain to be established. Recently, we provided evidence for the involvement of multiple ASCPs in apoptosis (13Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L. Trapani J.A.

We also demonstrated that lamin A is cleaved by Mch2α, but not CPP32, at the same site that is cleaved in apoptotic S/M extracts (20Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8395-8400Crossref Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In one study, we demonstrated that the newly identified FADD-like ASCP (Mch4) can process and activate CPP32 and Mch3 (13Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). pro-Mch4 and pro-Mch5 are the only known ASCPs that contain FADD-like death effector domains in their long N-terminal pro-domain, suggesting possible involvement in Fas and other apoptotic pathways (13Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). It appears that proteases, such as Mch4 and Mch5 with long pro-domains, might be upstream and could interact with the proximal signal transduction machinery of apoptosis. Others with short pro-domains, such as CPP32, Mch3, and Mch2α, are downstream or distal, operating at or near the cell death effector level. CPP32 appears to be an important central intermediary in the cell death pathway. This is evident from its ability to be activated by granzyme B and by the upstream FADD-like proteases Mch4 and Mch5 (13Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F.

Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Identification of ASCPs that are targets for activation by mature CPP32 should help us to understand the biochemical events that lead to the apoptotic morphology. The most likely targets for CPP32 are those ASCPs that contain the processing site DXXD between their large and small subunits. These include Nedd2/Ich-1, Mch2α, and Mch6 (this study). Recently, we demonstrated that Nedd2 is a substrate for mature CPP32 and granzyme B (22Harvey N.L. Trapani J.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Kumar S. Genes Cells. 1996; 1 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification and cloning of a new member of the family of mammalian ASCPs that we have designated Mch6 (mammalian ced-3 homolog 6). We provide evidence that pro-Mch6 is a natural substrate for granzyme B and mature CPP32. Furthermore, we show that mature CPP32 can directly process and activate pro-Mch2α by cleaving at three Asp cleavage sites. These data suggest that activation of CPP32 in apoptosis could lead to activation of pro-Mch2α and pro-Mch6. To clone Mch6, a 10-μl aliquot of human Jurkat λ Uni-ZAP XR cDNA library (8Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing ∼108 plaque-forming units was denatured at 99°C for 5 min and used as a template for PCR amplification with PCR primer Mch6-pr1 (CTCAACGTACCAGGAGCC) derived from the GenBank-Established Sequence Tag sequence T97582 and the T3 vector-specific primer (Stratagene). A 10-μl aliquot of the primary amplification product was then used as a template for a secondary PCR amplification with primer Mch6-pr2 (CCTGGGAAAGTAGAGTAGG) derived from the same Established Sequence Tag sequence and the SK-Zap vector-specific primer (11Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2737-2742PubMed Google Scholar) located downstream of the T3 primer. The secondary amplification products were cloned into a SmaI cut pBluescript II KS+ vector. The partial cDNA was then excised from the vector, radiolabeled, and used to screen the original Jurkat cDNA library. Positive λ clones were purified, rescued into the pBluescript II SK− plasmid vector, and sequenced. Tissue distribution analysis of Mch6 mRNA was performed on Northern blots (Clontech) using Mch6 cDNA as a probe, as described previously (12Fernandes-Alnemri T. Takahashi A. Armstrong R. Krebs J.

Recombinant human CPP32 and Mch2α with a C-terminal His6 tag were expressed in Escherichia coli and assayed as described recently (11Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2737-2742PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fernandes-Alnemri T. Takahashi A. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Fritz L. Tomaselli K.J. Wang L. Yu Z. Croce C.M. Earnshaw W.C. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S.

Granzyme B was purified by immunopurification from human natural killer cell lysates using granzyme B-specific monoclonal antibody and assayed as described previously (23Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Dawson M. Smyth M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. Apostolidis V.A. Dawson M. Browne K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18359-18365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Potential aspartate processing sites in pro-CPP32, pro-Mch2α, or pro-Mch6 were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using overlapping PCR mutagenic oligonucleotides. The resulting PCR products were subcloned in pBluescript II KS+ vector (pro-Mch2α) or pET-21b vector (pro-CPP32 and pro-Mch6) under the T7 promoter, and their sequences were verified by sequence analysis. Wild-type and mutated cDNAs were in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using a coupled transcription/translation TNT kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Two μl of the translation reactions were incubated with purified enzymes CPP32 (30 ng = 1 pmol) or granzyme B (140 ng = 5 pmol in the case of pro-Mch2α or 280 ng = 10 pmol in the case of pro-Mch6) in ICE buffer (25 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1% CHAPS, pH 7.5) in a final volume of 10 μl. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for various times and then analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Processing of CPP32 in 697 cellular extracts treated with granzyme B was determined by Western blot analysis, using a rabbit polyclonal anti-human CPP32 antibody. This antibody was raised against a recombinant p20 subunit (amino acids 1-175) of human CPP32. A search of the GenBank Established Sequence Tags for sequences related to CPP32 and Mch2α identified a short established sequence tag with accession number T97582. Based on this sequence information, an ∼2-kilobase cDNA was cloned from a human Jurkat T-lymphocyte cDNA library using a similar methodology as described recently (11Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2737-2742PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fernandes-Alnemri T. Takahashi A. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Fritz L. Tomaselli K.J. Wang L. Yu Z. Croce C.M. Earnshaw W.C. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6045-6052PubMed Google Scholar). This cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1248 base pairs that encodes a 416-amino acid protein, named Mch6, with a predicted molecular mass of ∼46.2 kDa (Fig. 1A). The Ced-3-like ASCP subfamily includes Ced-3, CPP32, Mch2α, Mch3, Mch4, and Mch5 (13Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of all known ASCPs revealed that Mch6 belongs to this subfamily (Fig. 1B). Within the subfamily, Mch6 shows highest homology to CPP32 (∼37% identity and 57% similarity). Mch6 is structurally similar to other ASCPs. A mature enzyme could be derived from the precursor pro-enzyme by cleavage at highly conserved Asp residues (Asp315 and/or Asp330) located between the two subunits (Fig. 1B). Other potential aspartate cleavage sites are present in the pro-domain region of pro-Mch6 that could also be cleaved to remove the pro-domain (Fig. 1A). The major difference between this enzyme and other family members, however, is that the fourth residue in its active site pentapeptide (QACGG) is a Gly instead of Arg or Gln (Fig. 1B). The pro-domain of pro-Mch6 has high homology to the pro-domains of CED-3 and Nedd2/Ich-1. There is evidence suggesting that the pro-domain of some ASCPs could play a role in the activation of the pro-enzyme (25Ramage P. Cheneval D. Chvei M. Graff P. Hemmig R. Heng R. Kocher H.P. Mackenzie A. Memmert K. Revesz L. Wishart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9378-9383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we discovered recently that the pro-domains of pro-Mch4 and pro-Mch5 contain FADD-like death effector domains (13Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). These domains could interact with FADD or other cellular FADD-like proteins, thus connecting the proximal apoptotic signal transduction pathways (i.e., Fas pathway) to the downstream ASCP activation cascade. The crystal structure of ICE revealed that His237, Gly238, and Cys285 are involved in catalysis, whereas Arg179, Gln283, Arg341, and Ser347 are involved in binding the carboxylate side chain of the substrate P1 aspartate (5Walker N.P.C.

These residues are identical in all family members including Mch6, except in Mch5, where there is a Ser to Thr conservative substitution for the residue corresponding to Ser347 of ICE (Fig. 1B). Another Ser to Thr conservative substitution can also be seen in Mch4 in the region corresponding to Ser236 of ICE, which is one of the residues that participates in binding the substrate P2-P4 residues. Other residues that might participate in binding the substrate P2-P4 residues are not widely conserved, suggesting that they may determine substrate specificity. The pro-Mch6 riboprobe detected three major mRNA species (∼1.0, ∼2.4, and ∼4.4 kilobases) in most human tissues (Fig. 2). The highest expression is seen in the heart, with moderate expression in liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. Lowest expression was observed in the other tissues. The presence of multiple mRNA species was observed previously with ICE mRNA (26Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Mosley B. Nelson N. Van Ness K. Greenstreet T.A. March C.J. Kronheim S.R. Druck T. Cannizzaro L.A. Huebner K. Black R.A. Science. 1992; 256: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) and is suggestive of alternative splicing or polyadenylation. pro-Mch6 contains two potential processing sequences between its large and small subunits (Fig. 1). The 312PEPDA316 site is a potential granzyme B cleavage site because it contains an acidic residue at the P3 position. The 327DQLDA331 site is a potential CPP32 cleavage site, because it is similar to the DEVDG site in PARP and DNA-PKcs (27Song Q. Lees-Miller S. Kumar S. Zhang N. Smit G.C.M. Jackson S. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Lavin M.F. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 3238-3246Crossref Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and it contains an Asp residue at the P4 position. To test whether pro-Mch6 is a substrate for CPP32, pro-Mch6 was translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and then incubated with purified recombinant human CPP32. Time course analysis (Fig. 3A) revealed that CPP32 cleaves pro-Mch6 at one site to generate two cleavage products of molecular masses ∼37 kDa (p37) and ∼10 kDa (p10). These products can be detected within the first 15 min (lanes 2 and 3). Longer incubation results in a decrease in the intensity of the full-length 46-kDa band and an increase in the intensity of the p37 and p10 products (lanes 5 and 6). No significant processing of the p37 product was observed upon prolonged incubation, suggesting that CPP32 cleaves preferentially at one site within the pro-Mch6 polypeptide. The sizes of the cleavage products are consistent with cleavage at the DQLDA site, which contains Asp330. This was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of Asp315 and Asp330. As expected, CPP32 was unable to process the Asp330 mutant to the p37 and p10 products (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, it was able to process the Asp315 mutant to generate the p37 and p10 products (Fig. 3E). These products are indistinguishable from those obtained with the wild-type pro-Mch6 (Fig. 3A). This establishes that Asp330 is the CPP32 processing site. One way by which granzyme B can induce apoptosis in target cells is by activation of ASCPs. Recently, we demonstrated that granzyme B is able to process multiple members of the ASCP family (13Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). To test whether granzyme B can process pro-Mch6, 35S-labeled pro-Mch6 was incubated with granzyme B and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Fig. 3B shows that granzyme B cleaves pro-Mch6 preferentially at one site to generate two cleavage products: a large ∼35-kDa (p35) product and a small ∼12-kDa (p12) product. The large granzyme B-cleaved product migrates faster than the large CPP32-cleaved product, suggesting that the two enzymes cleave at two different sites. The granzyme B cleavage site is N-terminal to the CPP32 cleavage site, and it is most likely to be Asp315 within the PEPDA site. This was confirmed using the Asp315 and Asp330 mutant pro-Mch6 (Fig. 3, D and F). Unlike CPP32, granzyme B was able to cleave the Asp330 mutant to generate the p35 and p12 products (Fig. 3D). Mutation of Asp315 prevented granzyme B from cleaving pro-Mch6 at the PEPDA site, as evidenced from the absence of the p35 and p12 products (Fig. 3F). Interestingly, granzyme B could still cleave this mutant at the DQLDA site, but less efficiently than CPP32, to generate faint p37 and p10 products. This establishes that granzyme B processes pro-Mch6 at Asp315 and Asp330 with preference for Asp315 over Asp330. A double mutation of Asp315 and Asp330 completely blocked granzyme B and CPP32 processing of pro-Mch6 (data not shown). Because CPP32 and granzyme B process pro-Mch6 preferentially at two different sites, it is possible that activation of pro-CPP32 by granzyme B in cell lysates could result in cleavage of pro-Mch6 at both sites simultaneously. To test this possibility, 35S-labeled pro-Mch6 was mixed with cell extract from the 697 lymphocytic cell line and then incubated with granzyme B. The proteins were analyzed at different time points by Western blotting using the CPP32-p20 antibody to detect activation of endogenous pro-CPP32 (Fig. 4A, upper panel) and by autoradiography to detect processing of pro-Mch6 (Fig. 4A, lower panel). The p20/p19 doublet of mature CPP32 was detected in less than 15 min simultaneously with the disappearance of the 32-kDa pro-CPP32 (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lane 2). Subsequently, the p20 product was autocatalytically processed to the p19 (lanes 3-6). In the presence of the DEVD-CHO inhibitor, only the p20 can be detected (lane 7) because CPP32 was inhibited under these conditions. Autoradiographic analysis of the same samples revealed a time-dependent processing of pro-Mch6 to the p35 (granzyme B product) and p37 (CPP32 product) bands (Fig. 4A, lower panel). Also detectable was the p12/p10 band. Interestingly, when CPP32 was inhibited by DEVD-CHO, only the granzyme B-generated p35 and p12 bands were detected (lane 7). Because cell lysates contain all of the cytoplasmic components necessary for apoptosis (21Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 28Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.M. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), the observed products (p37, p35, p12, and p10) are most likely produced in cells undergoing granzyme B-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, the mature Mch6 enzyme is derived from the pro-enzyme by cleavage at Asp315 and Asp330 to generate the large (p35) and small (p10) subunits (Fig. 4B). Because there was no evidence of efficient processing in the pro-domain in cell lysate (Fig. 4A), our data suggest that p35 and p10 are the large and small subunits of mature Mch6, respectively. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that under different conditions, the p35 product may be further processed to remove the N-terminal pro-domain. In cells undergoing apoptosis or in nuclei incubated with apoptotic extracts, lamin cleavage occurs subsequent to PARP cleavage and is much slower than PARP cleavage (31Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H.

https://openalex.org/W1998611493,"COAGULATION factor V is a critical cofactor for the activation of prothrombin to thrombin, the penultimate step in the generation of a fibrin blood clot1,2. Genetic deficiency of factor V results in a congenital bleeding disorder (parahaemophilia) 3, whereas inheritance of a mutation rendering factor V resistant to inactivation is an important risk factor for thrombosis4,5. We report here that approximately half of homozygous embryos deficient in factor V (Fv−/−), which have been generated by gene targeting, die at embryonic day (E) 9–10, possibly as a result of an abnormality in the yolk-sac vasculature. The remaining Fv−/− mice progress normally to term, but die from massive haemorrhage within 2 hours of birth. Considered together with the milder phenotypes generally associated with deficiencies of other clotting factors6,7, our findings demonstrate the primary role of the common coagulation pathway and the absolute requirement for functional factor V for prothrombinase activity. They also provide direct evidence for the existence of other critical haemostatic functions for thrombin in addition to fibrin clot formation, and identify a previously unrecognized role for the coagulation system in early mammalian development."

The mean age A of stratospheric air determined from CO2 data is approximately 5 years in the mid-stratosphere. The mean age is mathematically equivalent to a conserved tracer analogous to exhaust from stratospheric aircraft.

Administration of a small dose of nephrotoxic sera induced severe proliferative and necrotizing glomerulonephritis, with crescentic formation in the early phase and glomerulosclerosis in the later phase, in Wistar-Kyoto rats. MCAF/MCP-1 protein was detected immunohistochemically in glomeruli, vascular endothelial cells, and tubular epithelial cells in the early phase of injured kidney tissues but not in normal ones. Anti-MCAF/MCP-1 antibodies decreased the number of M(phi) in glomeruli, and prevented crescentic formation and the fusion of epithelial cell foot process in nephritic rats, thereby decreasing the excreted amounts of protein to normal levels on days 3 and 6. Furthermore, anti-MCAF/MCP-1 antibodies remarkably reduced glomerulosclerosis and improved renal dysfunction as well as proteinuria in the later phase (56 days).

Intracellular cAMP concentrations are principally controlled at the level of its synthesis by the hormonal regulation of adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of ATP to cAMP. Hormonal regulation of adenylyl cyclases is brought about by the receptor-catalyzed activation of heterotrimeric G proteins that in turn regulate the cyclases by the released α or βγ subunits. Molecular genetic approaches have identified nine mammalian isoforms of adenylyl cyclase (types I-IX) (reviewed in 1Iyengar R.

Regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by hormone receptors coupled to members of the Gi class of G proteins is more complex.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected and loaded on a Fast Q column (10 × 100 mm; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was washed with 5 volumes of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and eluted with a gradient of 0-400 mM NaCl in buffer B (10 column volumes) at a rate of 3 ml/min. Fractions containing high PKC activity (as measured by incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into histone H3 (27Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10039-10043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) were pooled. For some preparations, the recombinant enzyme was further purified by chromatography on a polyacrylamide-immobilized phosphatidylserine column, synthesized, and run as described (28Girard P.R. Mazzei G.J. Wood J.G. Kuo J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3030-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In all cases, glycerol was added to the final preparations of PKCα to a final concentration of 20%, and aliquots of the enzyme were stored at −70°C. Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured using the procedure described by Smigel (29Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were performed at 30°C in a final volume of 100 μl, and the final concentration of MgCl2 and EGTA was 10 and 1 mM, respectively. Before the initiation of the assay, adenylyl cyclase preparations were incubated with PKCα for 10 or 20 min at 30°C in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 30 mM Na-HEPES (pH 8), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM ATP, 0.4 mM EDTA, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 1 μM phorbol myristic acid, 2 mM dipotassium phosphoenolpyruvate, and 0.067 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Membrane preparations were assayed for 10 min; purified adenylyl cyclase was assayed for 5 min. G protein βγ subunits were purified from bovine brain following procedures by Sternweis and Robishaw (30Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant Gsα (rGsα) was synthesized in bacteria and purified as described by Lee et al. (31Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by staining with Amido Black (32Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). The α subunits were activated by incubation with 50 mM Na-HEPES (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 400 μM GTPγS at 30°C for 30 min (33Graziano M.P. Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); free GTPγS was removed by gel filtration. PKCα was incubated at 30°C for 5 min in a 250-μl reaction volume consisting of 50 mM Na-HEPES (pH 8), 7 mM MgCl2, 0.6 mM EDTA, 3 mM CaCl2, 15 μM ATP, 3 mM dipotassium phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 1.5 μM phorbol myristic acid. Adenylyl cyclase (1.7 pmol) purified from Sf9 membranes and [γ-32P]ATP (4,000 cpm/pmol) were then added to the reaction mixture to give a final volume of 350 μl and incubated at 30°C for 5 min. The samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide, and subjected to electrophoresis through a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel as described by Taussig et al. (26Taussig R. Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated products were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak X-OMAT AR film or by analysis on a Molecular Dynamics 445-SI PhosphorImager. To examine the effects of PKC on the regulation of type II adenylyl cyclase, we preincubated recombinant PKCα (purified from Sf9 cells) with membranes prepared from Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus encoding this adenylyl cyclase isoform. Adenylyl cyclase activity was then assayed in the absence or presence of a single concentration of forskolin, rGsα, or G protein βγ subunits or a combination of rGsα and βγ. As shown in Fig. 1A, preincubation of type II adenylyl cyclase with PKCα increased basal, forskolin-stimulated, Gsα-stimulated, and βγ-stimulated activities. Surprisingly, PKCα pretreatment reduced the activity measured in the presence of rGsα+βγ despite the fact that PKCα elevated the activity of type II adenylyl cyclase in the presence of either regulator alone. As shown in Fig. 1B, the effect was saturable with respect to the amount of added PKCα, as illustrated for the Gsα-stimulated activity. In addition, the PKCα effects can be blocked by bisindolyl maleimide, a potent and specific PKC inhibitor. The boiled PKCα preparation had no effect on cyclase activity, ruling out activation due to buffer components (data not shown). Finally, we determined that neither GTPγS-bound rGsα nor βγ is directly phosphorylated by PKCα, demonstrating that the observed effect is not mediated by the phosphorylation of the cyclase regulators (data not shown). Similar analysis of the effects of PKCα on the type IV isoform (a second βγ-stimulated cyclase) revealed quite different results, shown in Fig. 2. Unlike the type II enzyme, treatment of type IV adenylyl cyclase with PKCα has little effect on the basal, forskolin-stimulated, or βγ-stimulated activities. More strikingly, PKCα decreases both the Gsα-stimulated and Gsα+βγ-stimulated activities of this isoform. To gain further insight into the effect of PKCα on Gsα-stimulated activities, we examined the effect of PKC treatment on dose-dependent stimulation by rGsα. Inspection of the dose-response curve in Fig. 3A reveals that PKC-treated type II adenylyl cyclase is more responsive to stimulation by rGsα than the nontreated enzyme; no change in the maximum Gsα-stimulated activity was observed. By contrast, PKC treatment of type IV adenylyl cyclase reduces its responsiveness to Gsα. PKCα does not affect the basal type IV cyclase activity; however, the Gsα-stimulated activity is inhibited over the entire range of rGsα concentrations tested (Fig. 3B). We could not determine if maximal Gsα-stimulated activity was also reduced because we were unable to reach saturating rGsα concentrations for the kinase-treated type IV enzyme. We next tested the effect of PKCα on the dose-dependent stimulation of type II adenylyl cyclase by βγ in both the absence and presence of Gsα stimulation. In the absence of rGsα, βγ stimulation of type II adenylyl cyclase was very modest, requiring high nanomolar to micromolar concentrations of βγ to see substantial stimulation. Nevertheless, pretreatment with PKCα resulted in an augmentation of the βγ response (Fig. 4A), and in the presence of high (300 nM) βγ concentrations, activities were more than additive with the enhanced basal activity and therefore not due solely to increases in the basal activity of the enzyme. Upon the addition of rGsα to the assay (in which βγ effects were magnified), two striking observations were apparent (Fig. 4B). First, the addition of rGsα caused a leftward shift in the βγ dose-response curve (compare the curves marked with ∘ in Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that Gsα either allosterically increases the apparent affinity of the cyclase for βγ or exposes a second high affinity βγ site on the enzyme. Second, pretreatment of the type II cyclase with PKCα eliminated superstimulation by βγ by removing this high affinity interaction (Fig. 4B). Like type II adenylyl cyclase, type IV is stimulated by βγ in the presence of rGsα. In contrast to the type II enzyme, we observed no stimulation of type IV adenylyl cyclase at the βγ concentrations tested when assayed in the absence of rGsα, and pretreatment of this cyclase with PKCα had little effect when assayed under these conditions (Fig. 2). However, as shown in Fig. 5, PKC treatment of type IV membranes blocked the ability of βγ to superstimulate type IV adenylyl cyclase in the presence of rGsα. Because PKC treatment reduced stimulation of type IV adenylyl cyclase by Gsα alone, we examined whether the PKC treatment decreased Gsα stimulation of type IV adenylyl cyclase below a threshold activity necessary to observe βγ superstimulation. At reduced rGsα concentrations (Fig. 5, □) that give comparable cyclase activity (in the absence of βγ) to that of the PKC-treated enzyme assayed at high Gsα concentration •, βγ superstimulation was observed for the nontreated sample but not for the kinase-treated samples. When higher concentrations of Gsα (3 μM) were tested, still no βγ superstimulation was observed in the presence of PKC, even though βγ superstimulation was still evident in the absence of PKC at rGsα concentrations 3 orders of magnitude lower (3 nM), in which Gsα stimulation of type IV was not measurable (data not shown). These results suggest that PKC treatment of the type IV adenylyl cyclase causes a block of βγ effects in addition to reducing the sensitivity to Gsα, thereby altering the ability of this cyclase to integrate coincidental hormonal inputs from Gs- and Gi/Go-mediated pathways. We next sought to determine whether the regulatory changes induced by PKC treatment of membranes were due to the phosphorylation of adenylyl cyclase by PKC. Using procedures that we previously developed, we purified recombinant type II adenylyl cyclase from Sf9 cells and examined the effects of PKC on the activity of this purified cyclase preparation. Preincubation of purified type II cyclase with purified PKC resulted in an increase in Gsα-stimulated activity that was blocked by the addition of bisindolyl maleimide, a specific PKC inhibitor (Fig. 6A). However, the magnitude of this response was consistently much smaller than that observed in membrane preparations (compare Figs. 6A and 2A), and similarly small effects of PKC on purified type II adenylyl cyclase were seen when forskolin-stimulated activity was assayed (data not shown). This loss of responsiveness to PKC is not due to the purification process; rather, it is evident upon removal of the type II adenylyl cyclase from the membrane upon detergent solubilization. As shown in Fig. 6B, the addition of β-dodecyl maltoside (the detergent used to solubilize and purify the recombinant cyclase) to the PKC-treated membranes resulted in the loss of the enhanced forskolin response of the type II adenylyl cyclase. Similar results were obtained when the order of treatment was reversed (detergent addition followed by PKC treatment), when other cyclase regulators were used, or when other detergents were tested (data not shown). 2Y. Ishikawa, personal communication. The observation that the effects of PKC on type II adenylyl cyclase activity (measured in membranes) are lost after detergent solubilization suggests that either: 1) the effects of PKC we measured may not be due to a direct phosphorylation of the cyclase by PKC but may result from phosphorylation of some accessory component present in the membranes; or 2) the conformational state of the cyclase in membranes is important to observe effects of phosphorylation by PKC. This second possibility is not unique to the type II adenylyl cyclase isoform. For example, Kawabe et al. (22Kawabe J. Iwami G. Ebina T. Ohno S. Katada T. Ueda Y. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16554-16558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that in intact cells or with purified enzyme, type V adenylyl cyclase can be phosphorylated (and its activity augmented) by PKC activation, whereas no effect is observed in membranes treated with PKC. In addition, calmodulin stimulation of type I adenylyl cyclase can be dramatically affected by detergents or phospholipid composition of the surrounding bilayer (34Yeager R.E. Heideman W. Olwin B.B. Keller C.H. Schmidt J.W. Shattuck R.L. Storm D.R. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). 3R. Taussig, unpublished observations. These results highlight the importance of the interaction between adenylyl cyclase and its membrane environment for the regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, either for conformational restraint or protein-lipid and/or protein-protein interactions. Clearly, type II adenylyl cyclase is phosphorylated in response to PKC activation. When coexpressed in Sf9 cells with PKCα, phosphorylation of type II adenylyl cyclase was detected in response to activation of the kinase by phorbol esters (21Jacobowitz O. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10630-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, as shown in Fig. 7, PKC can directly phosphorylate type II adenylyl cyclase; incubation of purified type II adenylyl cyclase with purified recombinant PKCα in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP resulted in a dose-dependent increase in phosphorylation of the cyclase that could be blocked by PKC inhibitors. However, in these experiments, we could maximally phosphorylate the enzyme to a stoichiometry of only 0.2. Similar stoichiometry was measured when type II adenylyl cyclase was affinity-purified from in vitro phosphorylated membrane preparations. In addition, reconstituting the purified cyclase into lipid vesicles of varying phospholipid compositions did not improve the incorporation of phosphate into the molecule. In summary, because the effects of PKC on type II adenylyl cyclase activity are drastically reduced in detergent solution and low stoichiometry of phosphorylation is observed with purified type II adenylyl cyclase, we are unable to attribute this phosphorylation to the changes in cyclase activity and responsiveness to G protein subunits and cannot rule out a possible role of an accessory component present in the Sf9 cell membranes that is required for the response of the cyclase to PKC. Adenylyl cyclase activity, and ultimately intracellular cAMP concentrations, can be regulated by a number of hormonal inputs coupled to heterotrimeric G protein-mediated pathways. Hormone receptors coupled to the Gs and Gi subclass of G proteins can directly activate or inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity through the interactions of the released α and βγ subunits with the cyclase. Another level of regulation is provided by the cross-talk of distinct G protein-mediated signaling pathways with adenylyl cyclase isoforms. For example, hormonal activation of a Gq-coupled receptor leading to the activation of PKC (via a process involving phospholipase C activation, diacylglycerol and IP3 production, and released intracellular calcium) can have effects on the activities of different adenylyl cyclase isoforms (17Choi E.J.

Our studies demonstrate that in addition to regulating adenylyl cyclase activity itself, PKC can modulate the ability of the adenylyl cyclase isoforms to respond to different G protein subunits. As diagrammed in Fig. 8, the type II and IV adenylyl cyclases, isoforms that exhibit almost identical regulatory patterns with respect to their responses to G protein subunits, are affected quite differently by PKC. Both adenylyl cyclases can integrate hormonal inputs from Gs-, Gi-, and Gq-coupled receptors that are mediated by Gsα, βγ, and PKC, respectively. Hormonal activation of PKCα causes an increased responsiveness of type II adenylyl cyclase to Gsα, leading to an enhanced Gsα-stimulated activity as outlined in Fig. 8A. PKCα also enhances βγ stimulation of type II adenylyl cyclase, although these effects require high nanomolar to micromolar concentrations of βγ, a concentration more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than that required to see βγ effects on other adenylyl cyclases, phospholipases, or ion channels (13Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 35Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In contrast, lower concentrations (EC50 = 5-15 nM) of βγ are required to see superstimulation of type II adenylyl cyclase in the presence of Gsα, and therefore, augmentation of βγ stimulation by PKCα or Gsα seems to occur by distinct mechanisms. Our surprising observation that PKCα augments βγ stimulation but blocks the βγ superstimulation of type II adenylyl cyclase (in the presence of Gsα) may be due to an inability of Gsα to expose the high affinity βγ site on type II cyclase after PKC treatment. Type IV regulation is modulated very differently by PKCα, as diagrammed in Fig. 8B. PKCα activation leads to a reduced responsiveness of type IV adenylyl cyclase to Gsα, resulting in decreased Gsα-stimulated activity. This is the first demonstration of an inhibitory effect of PKC on cloned adenylyl cyclase activity and may serve to explain the inhibitory effects of phorbol esters on the Gsα-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity observed in some mammalian cell lines (37Gorman R.R. Benjamin C.W. Tarpley W.G. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1987; 17B: 963-968PubMed Google Scholar, 38Gusovsky F. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 124-129PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the effects on Gsα activation, PKCα blocks the superstimulation of type IV adenylyl cyclase by βγ subunits. Adenylyl cyclase activity can be regulated by multiple hormonal inputs that are mediated by the direct interaction of the cyclase with G protein subunits or via G protein-regulated pathways leading to the release of intracellular calcium and the subsequent activation of PKC. The conditional stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by βγ subunits (in the presence of Gsα) serves as an example of the temporal integration of Gs- and Gi-mediated hormonal signals by type II and IV adenylyl cyclases (13Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 15Gao B. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). PKC differentially affects the ability of type II adenylyl cyclase to respond to Gs and/or Gi activation, rendering the enzyme more sensitive to stimulation by Gsα yet insensitive to superstimulation by βγ released by Gi or Go activation. Integration of these same signals derived from hormonal activation of Gs (Gsα), Gi (βγ), and Gq (PKC) is seen for the type IV isoform; however, in the case of this cyclase, the activation of PKC reduces both the Gsα and βγ stimulation of the enzyme. Our current study suggests that an added level of adenylyl cyclase regulation is imparted by the integration of Gq-mediated pathways (leading to the activation of PKC) that can alter the inherent activities of adenylyl cyclases, but more importantly, that modulate regulation by G protein subunits.

This study was aimed at investigating the presence of alternative splicing of human iNOS mRNA. cDNAs obtained from human tissues and cultured cells were subjected to PCR-based segmental analysis of the iNOS gene. We demonstrate that the human iNOS gene has a previously unsuspected capacity to generate multiple mRNA isoforms, predicting novel forms of iNOS protein. Four distinct cDNAs were found, which included deletions of: (i) exon 5; (ii) exons 8 and 9; (iii) exons 9, 10, and 11; and (iv) exons 15 and 16 (see Fig. 1B). The alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts were regulated in a tissue-specific manner and induced by cytokines. Informed consents approved by the Institutional Review Board were obtained from normal nonsmoking volunteers. Nasal and bronchial epithelial cells were obtained using a standard cytology brush and fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Alveolar macrophages were recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage and purified by adherence to plastic (5Chu S.C. Wu H.-P. Banks T.C. Eissa N.T. Moss J. J. Biol.

DLD-1 cells were incubated for 24 h with or without a mixture of interferon-γ (100 units/ml), interleukin-1β (IL-1β, 0.5 ng/ml), tumor necrosis factor-α (10 ng/ml), and interleukin-6 (IL-6, 200 units/ml).

Confluent cells were used for all experiments. Interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6 were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim Corp. IL-1β was obtained from Genzyme Corp. Total RNA was extracted from nasal and bronchial epithelial cells and from alveolar macrophages by the guanidinium thiocyanate-CsCl gradient method. Total RNA from human tissues was purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. cDNA was transcribed from RNA using Molony murine leukemia virus RNase H− reverse transcriptase and oligo (dT) 12-18 primer (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNA was amplified by PCR using human iNOS-specific primers (see Fig. 1B): (i) INH1 in exon 4 (5′-GTGAGGATCAAAAACTGGGG-3′) and INH2 in exon 6 (5′-ACCTGCAGGTTGGACCAC-3′); (ii) SIN9 in exon 6 (5′-GAGATAGAAACAACAGGAACCTACC-3′) and INH22 in exon 12 (5′-GTCCATGATGGTCACATTCTGCTT-3′); (iii) INH21 in exon 8 (5′-ACCCTGCCAACGTGGAATTCACT-3′) and HINO10 in exon 13 (5′-GCATCAGC ATACAGGCAAAGAGC-3′); and (iv) SIN19 in exon 12 (5′-GCAGGACGAGAAGCGGAGACC-3′) and HINO20 in exon 18 (5′-GATTCTGCCGAGATTTGAGCCTC-3′).

PCR products were subcloned into the pCR II plasmid (Invitrogen Corp.) and subjected to sequence analysis using double-stranded DNA cycle sequencing (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and specific iNOS primers as well as β-actin-specific primers. PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis and evaluated by Southern blotting using 32P-labeled probe for full-length human iNOS cDNA or β-actin cDNA.

Deletion of exon 5 (149 bases) leads to a translational frameshift such that Gly106 would be followed by 28 novel deduced amino acids terminating in a stop codon in exon 6. A truncated protein of 134 amino acids with a molecular weight of 14,817 is predicted. There are, however, 112 nucleotides downstream of the premature stop codon, an ATG (in the original reading frame) that conforms, in part, to the Kozak consensus sequence, providing a potential second translation initiation site. Deletion of exons 8 and 9 (282 bases) produces an in-frame deletion of deduced amino acids 242-335, and deletion of exons 9, 10, and 11 (417 bases) leads to an in-frame loss of deduced amino acids 289-427. These regions, although they do not correspond to any of the identified functional domains of iNOS, represent regions conserved among NOS sequences, suggesting shared functions, possibly related to arginine binding (1Xie Q.

In splicing leading to deletion of exons 8 and 9, exon 7 terminates after the first two nucleotides of the codon for Arg241. In this iNOS isoform, however, the first nucleotide in exon 10 (adenine) becomes the third nucleotide needed to encode Arg, providing an example of complementary split codons that characterize alternatively spliced exons (15Medford R.M. Nguyen H.T. Destree A.T. Summers E. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1984; 38: 409-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The presence of alternatively spliced human iNOS mRNA transcripts was evaluated in pulmonary cells and in several human tissues. PCR products of a segmental analysis of the human iNOS gene were subjected to Southern analysis involving hybridization with a full-length human iNOS cDNA probe. With RNA from nasal epithelium, bronchial epithelium, and alveolar macrophages, products of the four identified sites of alternative splicing were detected, which constituted a minor fraction of total iNOS mRNA (Fig. 2). Overall, iNOS mRNA was more abundant in nasal and bronchial epithelium than in alveolar macrophages, taking into consideration the difference in the number of PCR cycles utilized in amplification (5Chu S.C. Wu H.-P. Banks T.C. Eissa N.T. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10625-10630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Guo F.H. De Raeve H.R. Rice T.W. Stuehr D.J.

Applying the same analysis to cDNAs from other human tissues, the four patterns of alternatively spliced iNOS mRNA transcripts were observed (Fig. 3). The ratios of the alternatively spliced to constitutively spliced mRNA species differed, however, among the tissues. In particular, iNOS mRNA transcripts with deletion of exon 5 were notably abundant in human cerebellum, suggesting that the isoform may have a specific tissue-related function (11Smith C.W.J. Patton J.G. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 527-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 15Medford R.M. Nguyen H.T. Destree A.T. Summers E. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1984; 38: 409-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine whether induction of iNOS is associated with concomitant alterations in amounts of the alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts, DLD-1 cells and A549 cells were incubated for 24 h with a mixture of cytokines and lipopolysaccharide. Upon induction of iNOS, a marked increase was identified in the levels of iNOS mRNA produced both by constitutive splicing and by alternative splicing involving the four sites (Fig. 4). In the synthesis of NO, iNOS is active as a dimeric complex that contains two identical subunits in which electrons from NADPH reduction are transferred by FAD and FMN to the catalytic site at the amino terminus (7Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The transfer of electrons is facilitated by a tightly bound CaM (17Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 18Cho H.J. Xie Q. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), and dimerization requires tetrahydrobiopterin (16Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The requirement for such complex interactions between different domains of iNOS for NO production makes the finding of alternative splicing of human iNOS mRNA rather unexpected. Because the four sites of alternative splicing result in deletion of conserved sequences, it is unlikely that any of these splice variants by themselves would be capable of generating NO. It seems more likely that alternative splicing may be involved in modifying the kinetics of NO synthesis or conferring new functions to NOS. Although NO production by the constitutive NOS isoforms is critically controlled through regulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels, iNOS, apparently, is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level (1Xie Q. Cho H.J. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Ding A. Troso T. Nathan C. Science. 1992; 256: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar, 2Geller D.A. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A.

Alternative splicing of mRNA may participate in the post-transcriptional regulation of NO production. Up-regulation of iNOS splice variants by cytokines may imply a role for these variants in maintaining or augmenting iNOS activity during infection or inflammatory response. Modulation of NO synthesis by alternatively spliced variants could be achieved through the formation of heterodimers. Lee et al. (19Lee M.C. Robinson L.J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27403-27406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) demonstrated by co-expression that truncated mutants of endothelial NOS formed heterodimers with wild-type endothelial NOS and exerted a dominant negative effect on its activity. Recently, Skerjanc et al. described a splice variant of the ITF-2 transcript encoding a transcription factor that inhibits MyoD activity through the formation of inactive heterodimers (20Skerjanc I.S. Truong J. Filion P. McBurney M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3555-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in the case of exon 5 deletion, a function of the frameshift may be to down-regulate iNOS gene expression, merely by producing prematurely terminated open reading frames. In such a case, the function of alternative splicing would be to act as a simple on/off switch, in much the same way as transcription is used to control gene expression (11Smith C.W.J. Patton J.G. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 527-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 12Bell L.R. Maine E.M. Schedl P. Cline T.W. Cell. 1988; 55: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of iNOS, if involved in the protection from the cytotoxic effects of excessive NO production, should be more important in organs where cells are terminally differentiated, such as the brain, which may explain the abundance of exon 5 deletion in mRNA transcripts in the cerebellum. Because the cytochrome c reductase activity of the carboxyl terminus of iNOS is equivalent to that of full-length iNOS (7Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the function of some of these variants could be similar to other cytochrome P-450 reductase proteins. Recently, alternative splicing of mRNA has been reported for neuronal NOS (21Ogura T. Yokoyama T. Fujisawa H. Kurashima Y. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Hall A.V. Antoniou H. Wang Y. Cheung A.H. Arbus A.M. Olson S.L. Lu W.C. Kau C.-L. Marsden P.A. J. Biol.

One of these splice variants has an in-frame deletion that corresponds to exons 9 and 10 of human iNOS. The presence of a relatively conserved pattern of alternative splicing in NOS suggests a common function for the resulting isoforms. Future studies will be necessary to determine the functional consequences of alternative splicing of human iNOS mRNA. Gene expression studies and generation of transgenic mice expressing different forms of iNOS may help to resolve this issue.

https://openalex.org/W2011168445,"The naturally occurring phospholipid, lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), regulates a broad range of cell processes, including gene transcription, mitogenesis, monocyte chemotaxis, smooth muscle relaxation, and platelet activation. Despite the growing list of cellular effects attributable to lyso-PC, the mechanism(s) by which it alters cell function have not been elucidated. In this report, we have examined the effects of exogenous lyso-PC on signal transduction processes within a variety of lyso-PC-responsive cells, including human platelets, monocyte-like THP-1 cells, and the megakaryoblastic cell line, MEG-01. Pretreatment of each of these cells with increasing concentrations of lyso-PC (25-150 μg/ml) was associated with a progressive increase in the cytosolic concentration of cAMP. The accumulation of cAMP in platelets correlated closely with the ability of lyso-PC to inhibit multiple platelet processes, including platelet aggregation, agonist-induced protein kinase C activation, thromboxane A2 generation, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet proteins. In each of the cell types examined, the ability of lyso-PC to increase the cellular levels of cAMP was synergistically enhanced by pretreating the cells with the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline (5 mM), and was specifically inhibited by the P-site inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase, 2,5-dideoxyadenosine. A role for the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in the lyso-PC-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase was suggested by the ability of the GTPase inhibitor, guanylyl 5′-thiophosphate (0.2 mM), to inhibit the lyso-PC-stimulated increase in cAMP, and also by the ability of cholera toxin to inhibit increases in membrane GTPase activity in response to lyso-PC. The functional significance of lyso-PC-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase was investigated in MEG-01 cells. Treatment of these cells with either lyso-PC or dibutyryl cAMP for 36-40 h resulted in a 3-5-fold increase in the surface expression of the natural anticoagulant protein, thrombomodulin (TM). The ability of lyso-PC to increase TM expression was abolished by pretreating these cells with the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, 2,5-dideoxyadenosine, whereas the dibutyryl cAMP-induced increase in TM remained insensitive to adenylyl cyclase inhibition. These studies define an important role for the adenylyl cyclase signaling system in mediating cellular effects induced by lyso-PC. The naturally occurring phospholipid, lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), regulates a broad range of cell processes, including gene transcription, mitogenesis, monocyte chemotaxis, smooth muscle relaxation, and platelet activation. Despite the growing list of cellular effects attributable to lyso-PC, the mechanism(s) by which it alters cell function have not been elucidated. In this report, we have examined the effects of exogenous lyso-PC on signal transduction processes within a variety of lyso-PC-responsive cells, including human platelets, monocyte-like THP-1 cells, and the megakaryoblastic cell line, MEG-01. Pretreatment of each of these cells with increasing concentrations of lyso-PC (25-150 μg/ml) was associated with a progressive increase in the cytosolic concentration of cAMP. The accumulation of cAMP in platelets correlated closely with the ability of lyso-PC to inhibit multiple platelet processes, including platelet aggregation, agonist-induced protein kinase C activation, thromboxane A2 generation, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet proteins. In each of the cell types examined, the ability of lyso-PC to increase the cellular levels of cAMP was synergistically enhanced by pretreating the cells with the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline (5 mM), and was specifically inhibited by the P-site inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase, 2,5-dideoxyadenosine. A role for the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, in the lyso-PC-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase was suggested by the ability of the GTPase inhibitor, guanylyl 5′-thiophosphate (0.2 mM), to inhibit the lyso-PC-stimulated increase in cAMP, and also by the ability of cholera toxin to inhibit increases in membrane GTPase activity in response to lyso-PC. The functional significance of lyso-PC-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase was investigated in MEG-01 cells. Treatment of these cells with either lyso-PC or dibutyryl cAMP for 36-40 h resulted in a 3-5-fold increase in the surface expression of the natural anticoagulant protein, thrombomodulin (TM). The ability of lyso-PC to increase TM expression was abolished by pretreating these cells with the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, 2,5-dideoxyadenosine, whereas the dibutyryl cAMP-induced increase in TM remained insensitive to adenylyl cyclase inhibition. These studies define an important role for the adenylyl cyclase signaling system in mediating cellular effects induced by lyso-PC.

While free fatty acids act as potential second messengers (1McPhail L.C. Clyton C.C. Snyderman R. Science. 1984; 224: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 2Tetsutaro S. Yoshinoro A.

Biochem. 1986; 55: 69-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the role of lysophospholipids in cellular physiology remains unclear. The natural phospholipid, lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), has recently emerged as an important mediator of the atherogenic effects of oxidized low density lipoprotein (4Kume N. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1138-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 5Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Fong L.G. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 84: 2995-2998Crossref Scopus (966) Google Scholar). This lysophospholipid constitutes as much as 40% of the total lipid content of oxidized low density lipoprotein (6Parthasarathy S. Steinbrecher R.P. Barnett J. Witztum J.C. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3000-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and has been detected in elevated levels in atherosclerotic lesions from animals fed an atherosclerotic diet (7Portman O.W. Alexander M. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 158-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, lyso-PC has multiple atherogenic effects. It is mitogenic for murine macrophages and has been postulated to play a critical role in oxidized low density lipoprotein-induced foam cell formation (8Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31430-31435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lyso-PC also induces endothelial cell gene expression of multiple growth factors involved in atherogenesis and inflammation (9Kume N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it can up-regulate the surface expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules involved in the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes into the arterial intima (4Kume N. Cybulsky M.I.

In addition to its atherogenic effects, there is growing evidence that in certain clinical settings the extracellular generation of lyso-PC by secretory PLA2 may promote tissue inflammation and induce hemostatic disturbances (10Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Lab. Invest. 1986; 55: 391-403PubMed Google Scholar, 11Schroder T.S. Kivilaakso E. Kinnunen P.K.J. Lempinen M. Scand. J.

Lyso-PC's proinflammatory effects include its ability to alter the adhesive properties of endothelial cells, induce chemotaxis of monocytes (5Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Fong L.G. Steinberg D. Proc.

Lyso-PC also has vasoactive properties, stimulating endothelium-dependent vascular smooth muscle relaxation (17Saito T. Wolf A. Menon N.K. Saeed M. Bing R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8246-8250Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and impairing endothelial-regulated vasomotor control (18Kugiyama K. Kerns S.A. Morrisett J.D. Roberts R. Henry P. Nature. 1990; 344: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this lipid has potent platelet inhibitory effects and is essential for the inhibition of platelet aggregation by a subset of secretory PLA2 (12Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. Newnham H.H. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major outstanding issue regarding lyso-PC pathophysiology is the mechanism(s) by which this polar phospholipid alters cell function. Other naturally occurring phospholipids, such as lysophosphatidic acid (lyso-PA), appear to evoke cellular responses (19Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), through specific G protein-coupled receptor(s) linked to the activation of phospholipase C and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (20Van Corven E.J.

Adenylyl cyclase is a ubiquitous integral membrane signaling enzyme responsible for the generation of the second messenger, cyclic 3′,5-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The enzyme activity of adenylyl cyclase is tightly controlled by specific G-proteins, which either stimulate (via Gsα or βγ) (22Tang W. Gilman A.G. Adenylyl Cyclases Cell. 1992; 70: 869-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 23Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 24Chen J.

Platelet Membrane Receptors: Molecular Biology, Immunology, Biochemistry, and Pathology. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 441Google Scholar). In human platelets, activation of adenylyl cyclase by prostacyclin or forskolin, results in a global down-regulation of all signaling events required for platelet activation (26Kroll M.H. Schafer A.I. Blood. 1989; 74: 1181-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of this signal transduction system in other cell types, by hormones, neurotransmitters, or other bioactive molecules, elicits diverse cellular effects related to cell cycle progression (27Broek D. Samiy N. Fasano O. Fujiyama A. Tamanoi F. Northup J. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 41: 763-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28Resnick R.J. Tomaska L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17006-17010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Lyso-PC has been demonstrated to regulate the activity of a number of intracellular signaling enzymes, including protein kinase C, as a necessary step for T-cell activation and possibly monocyte chemotaxis (14Asaoka Y. Oka M. Yoshida K. Sasaki Y. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6447-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Asaoka Y. Yoshida K. Sasaki Y. Nishizuka Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Lyso-PC directly stimulates guanylate cyclase enzyme activity and inhibits adenylyl cyclase in 3T3 mouse fibroblast membrane preparations (32Shier W.T. Baldwin J.H. Hamilton M.N. Thanassi N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1586-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), indicating a potential role for this lysophospholipid in the co-ordinated regulation of cyclic nucleotide second messengers. In other studies, thrombin stimulation of the prostaglandin synthesis in mouse fibroblasts and seminal vesicle microsomes was attenuated by exogenous lyso-PC, suggesting a role for this lysophospholipid in the regulation of prostaglandin synthesis (33Shier W.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although these studies suggest that the generation of lyso-PC within the cell can directly regulate the activity of a variety of signaling enzymes, they provide limited information on the signal transduction processes stimulated by extracellular lyso-PC. In this study, we have examined the signaling events induced by lyso-PC in a range of lyso-PC-responsive cells. Our results indicate that lyso-PC specifically stimulates the activation of adenylyl cyclase in human platelets, THP-1 and MEG-01 cell lines, leading to the production of cAMP. The increase in cellular cAMP correlated with the lyso-PC-mediated inhibition of platelet activation, and increased surface expression of thrombomodulin on MEG-01 cells. These studies suggest that the cellular effects induced by extracellular lyso-PC may be mediated, at least in part, by the adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway. All lysophospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, GTP, GDPβS, GDP, NAD, and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) were purchased from Sigma. Collagen was from Chrono-Log Corp, Haventown, PA, and bovine thrombin was from Parke-Davis Co., Morris Plains, NJ. [γ-32P]GTP, [32P]NAD, and [32P]phosphate were from DuPont NEN, Wilmington, DE. Cholera toxin was from ICN Biomedicals, Costa, Mesa, CA. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (mAb 4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (mAb PY20) was supplied by ICN Biomedicals Inc. Platelets were collected from healthy volunteers who had not taken anti-platelet medication for 2 weeks and washed according to a modified method of Baenziger and Majerus (34Baenziger N.L. Majerus P.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Blood was collected in acid-citrate-dextrose, 6:1 (v/v), containing 90 mM sodium citrate, 7 mM citric acid, pH 4.6, 140 mM dextrose, supplemented with 70 mM theophylline. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation of whole blood at 180 × g for 15 min. Platelet-rich plasma was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min and the platelets washed twice with buffer containing 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 4.3 mM K2HPO4, 24.3 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.5, 113 mM NaCl, 5.5 mM glucose, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 10 mM theophylline. The final platelet preparation was resuspended in a modified Tyrode's buffer, 12 mM NaHCO3, 0.32 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 5.5 mM glucose. Platelet aggregation was performed using a four channel automated platelet analyzer (Kyoto Daiichi, Japan) set to 950 rpm at 37°C. Each reaction mixture (400 μl) contained fibrinogen (1 mg/ml), BSA (5 mg/ml), washed platelets (3 × 108/ml), and the indicated concentrations of platelet agonist. The rate of platelet aggregation was determined from the slope of aggregometer tracings. Inhibition of platelet aggregation was expressed as the percentage difference in the initial rate of platelet aggregation in the presence or absence of lyso-PC. TXB2 was quantitated using a commercial kit (Amersham), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Platelets (1.2 × 109/ml) were washed and resuspended in phosphate-free Tyrode's buffer supplemented with 10 mM theophylline. [32P]H3PO4 was added to the platelet suspension (0.5 mCi/ml platelets), and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Free [32P]H3PO4 was removed by washing the platelets twice with the same buffer, before final resuspension in phosphate-free Tyrode's buffer. The 32P-labeled platelets (3 × 108/ml, in 200 μl of phosphate-free Tyrode's buffer) were stimulated with thrombin (0.05 unit/ml) in the presence of BSA (5 mg/ml) and a range of lyso-PC concentrations (10-100 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37°C. The reaction mixture was freeze-thawed three times using liquid nitrogen, boiled for 10 min in the presence of 3% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (w/v), and subjected to 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under reducing conditions. The gel was fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. Washed platelets were stirred in the presence of 0.05 unit/ml thrombin or platelet resuspension buffer for 5 min. The cells were lysed with SDS-reducing buffer and immediately boiled for 10 min. After electrophoresis and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, immunoblots of the platelet extracts were performed using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, PY20. Platelet membranes were prepared using a modified method of Steer and Wood (35Steer M.L. Wood A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10791-10797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Washed platelets (1.2 × 109) were lysed with a hypotonic buffer (12 ml) containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM benzamidine, and 0.4 mM leupeptin. Platelet membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was washed four times with Tris buffer (150 mM), pH 8.0, 1 mM EGTA. The washed platelet membranes were finally resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (containing 10 mM theophylline) for the adenylyl cyclase assays, or in 20 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.5, for the GTPase assays. Washed platelets (1 × 109/ml), THP-1 (1 × 107/ml), or MEG-01 (5 × 107/ml) cells were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (200 μl) containing 5 mg/ml BSA, and 10 mM theophylline where indicated. In some experiments adenylyl cyclase was inhibited by preincubating cells with 1 mM 2,5-dideoxyadenosine for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were treated with the indicated concentration of lyso-PC or PGE1 for 10 min at 37°C. The assays were terminated with the addition of 5 mM EDTA and the cells freeze-thawed three times. The samples were heated at 80°C for 20 min and centrifuged (15,000 × g) for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and assayed for cAMP (picomole of cAMP/108 platelets) using a commercial kit (Amersham), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Platelet membrane adenylyl cyclase assays were performed with 500 μg/ml membrane protein, 1 mM ATP, in the presence or absence of GDPβS (0.2-1.2 mM). Assays were initiated by the addition of PGE1 (200 ng/ml) or the indicated concentration of lyso-PC, and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. In some experiments, the membranes were preincubated with 2,5-dideoxyadenosine for 5 min at room temperature, prior to the addition of lyso-PC or PGE1. At the completion of the assays, the membranes were heated to 80°C for 20 min, then centrifuged (15,000 × g for 10 min), and the supernatant assayed for cAMP (picomole of cAMP/mg of membrane protein). GTPase activity was measured by monitoring the liberation of 32P from [γ-32P]GTP using a modified method of Houslay et al. (36Houslay M.D. Bojanic D. Wilson A. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture (100 μl) contained washed platelet membranes (50 μg/ml), 20 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM ATP, 2 μM [γ-32P]GTP (2-3 × 105 cpm/assay), in the presence of the indicated concentrations of lyso-PC, PGE1, or Triton X-100. Assays were performed for 30 min at 30°C and terminated by the addition of 400 μl of ice-cold phosphate buffer (20 mM), pH 7.5, containing 5% activated Norit-A charcoal. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the radioactivity measured from 200 μl of supernatant. All assays were performed within a linear range with respect to time and protein concentration. GTPase activity was expressed as the % increase above the basal activity of unstimulated platelet membranes. ADP-ribosylation of Gs was performed by incubating platelet membranes (500 μg/ml) with 1 mM NAD, 0.5 mM GTP, 0.5 mM ATP, and 120 μg/ml cholera toxin (preactivated with 50 mM dithiothreitol for 20 min at 37°C), in the presence of Tyrode's buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37°C. Control experiments were performed in the absence of cholera toxin. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, washed three times with 500 μl of ice-cold Tyrode's buffer, and finally resuspended in MOPS buffer prior to the performance of GTPase assays. MEG-01 cells were cultured using RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mM glutamine (ICN) at 37°C in the presence of 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 5% CO2. For measurement of surface TM, MEG-01 cells (0.5-1 × 106/ml) were seeded on 24-well plates, with or without 2 mM theophylline, and cultured in the presence of control buffer, the indicated concentrations of lyso-PC or dibutyryl-cAMP (1 mM) for 36-40 h. In some studies, the cells were preincubated with 1 mM 2,5-dideoxyadenosine for 40 min, prior to the addition of lyso-PC or dibutyryl-cAMP. The cells (0.5-1 × 106) were then harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (containing 5% fetal calf serum, 0.05% NaN3), and incubated with an anti-TM monoclonal antibody (kindly donated by Dr. Phillip Bird, Melbourne, Australia) for 30 min at 4°C. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with a fluorescence conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Sigma) for 30 min. These cells were washed a further two times with phosphate-buffered saline then resuspended to a final volume of 400 μl, prior to FACS analysis. To investigate the mechanism(s) by which lyso-PC regulates cell function, we examined signal transduction processes in a number of lyso-PC-responsive cells, including human platelets, monocyte-like THP-1 cells, and the megakaryoblastic cell line, MEG-01. Platelets are a particularly useful cell model for studying signal transduction processes, as these cells undergo rapid functional and morphological changes in response to stimulation, and the signaling processes regulating these cell processes have been investigated in considerable detail. Furthermore, these cells are responsive to several bioactive lipids, including platelet activating factor (37Valone F.H. Platelet Membrane Receptors: Molecular Biology, Immunology, Biochemistry, and Pathology. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 319Google Scholar), lyso-PA (38Benton A.M. Gerrard J.M. Michiel T. Kindom S.E. Blood. 1982; 60: 642-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and lyso-PC (12Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. Newnham H.H. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both platelet activating factor and lyso-PA stimulate platelet aggregation via receptor-linked signaling pathways (19Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 20Van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 37Valone F.H. Platelet Membrane Receptors: Molecular Biology, Immunology, Biochemistry, and Pathology. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 319Google Scholar), while lyso-PC inhibits platelet function by an as yet undefined mechanism (12Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. Newnham H.H. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our initial studies, we investigated the effects of exogenous lyso-PC on signal transduction processes in human platelets. Stimulation of platelets by a range of agonists is associated with the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2, leading to the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and the subsequent generation of prostaglandin endoperoxides and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) (3Needleman P. Turk J. Jakschik B.A. Morrison A.R. Lefkowith J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 69-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the effect of lyso-PC on TXA2 synthesis, by measuring the production of its stable metabolite thromboxane B2 (TXB2) in collagen-activated platelets. In these studies, we observed a close correlation between the inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation by increasing concentrations of lyso-PC (12.5-100 μg/ml), and the inhibition of TXB2 generation (Fig. 1A, lanes 3-6). Increasing the concentration of collagen (5-20 μg/ml), while maintaining a constant concentration of lyso-PC (100 μg/ml), overcame the platelet inhibitory effects of lyso-PC and lead to increased production of TXB2 (Fig. 1A, lanes 7-10). Qualitatively similar results were obtained in thrombin-stimulated platelets (data not shown). Although lyso-PC has well described toxic effects on cells at high concentrations (39Weltzien H.U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 559: 259-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) due to its natural detergent properties, several lines of evidence suggest that its inhibitory effects on platelet function are unlikely to be due to membrane lysis. First, the extracellular concentration of lactose dehydrogenase did not increase following pretreatment of the cells with lyso-PC (12.5-150 μg/ml). Second, the morphology of lyso-PC-treated platelets, as observed with phase-contrast microscopy, remained indistinguishable from untreated cells. Finally, the ability of high concentrations of collagen (20 μg/ml) and thrombin (0.2 unit/ml) to overcome the platelet inhibitory effects of lyso-PC, confirms the functional integrity of these cells. Previous studies have reported a role for free fatty acids and lyso-PC in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (1McPhail L.C. Clyton C.C. Snyderman R.

We therefore examined the effect of lyso-PC on PKC activation in resting and thrombin-stimulated platelets, by measuring the phosphorylation of the PKC substrate, p47. Pretreatment of platelets with lyso-PC alone (100 μg/ml) had minimal effect on the phosphorylation status of p47 (Fig. 1B, lane 9). In contrast, doses of thrombin (0.05 unit/ml) which can activate PKC independent of TXA2 production (40Sweatt J.D. Blair I.A. Cragoe E.J. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8660-8666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Sweatt J.D. Connolly T.M. Cragoe E.J. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8667-8673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), induced prominent p47 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Concentrations of lyso-PC which inhibited thrombin-induced aggregation (60-100 μg/ml) abolished p47 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8). In all experiments there was a close correlation between the inhibition of p47 phosphorylation and the abolition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Furthermore, as with TXB2 generation, the inhibitory effects of lyso-PC on PKC activation could be completely reversed by increasing the concentration of thrombin (data not shown). These studies indicate that the platelet inhibitory effects of lyso-PC are not confined to the inhibition of TXA2 generation. In addition to activating serine/threonine kinases, thrombin stimulation of platelets also leads to the activation of multiple non-receptor tyrosine kinases, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple platelet proteins. These phosphorylation events are considered to play an important role in regulating platelet functional responses (42Golden A. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have demonstrated earlier that the TcR/CD3-induced activation of Fyn results in tyrosine phosphorylation of several Fyn-associated proteins, including a protein of 116 kDa. In this report, we identify the Fyn-associated 116-kDa phosphoprotein (p116) as c-Cbl. The identity of p116 has been demonstrated by its specific reactivity with anti-Cbl and similarity of phosphopeptides generated by V8 proteolysis of phospho-Cbl and p116. We demonstrate here that the association of Fyn and c-Cbl is direct and does not require the presence of other proteins. We also demonstrate that Fyn is the Src family kinase that preferentially interacts with c-Cbl in T cells. The fraction of c-Cbl capable of coprecipitating with Fyn is increased by TcR/CD3 ligation. This increase is likely due to the involvement of Fyn SH2 in the interactions between Fyn and tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl.

Lck is another Src-related kinase involved in TcR signaling. Although Lck appears not to be directly associated with the TcR/CD3, the CD4-Lck complex (12Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M.

The major Fyn-associated phosphoprotein of 116 kDa (p116) becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo, as well as in vitro, following TcR/CD3 ligation (20Dasilva A.J. Janssen O. Rudd C.E. J. Exp.

The interactions of Fyn with p116 and the other major Fyn-associated protein, p82, appear to be specific for this Src-related kinase (21Tsygankov A.Y. Spana C. Rowley R.B. Penhallow R.C.

Another important difference between the two Fyn-associated proteins is that the tyrosine phosphorylation of p116 is entirely TcR/CD3 ligation-dependent, whereas the tyrosine phosphorylation of p82 is little affected by TcR/CD3 ligation (21Tsygankov A.Y.

These results suggest that p116 may represent a specific physiological substrate of Fyn.In this report, we identify the Fyn-associated p116 as c-Cbl. c-Cbl is a product of the corresponding proto-oncogene exhibiting several distinct features of a transcription factor (23Blake T.J.

The specificity and the molecular basis of c-Cbl/Fyn interactions also remain to be elucidated. Here we report that the Fyn-associated p116 protein is recognized by anti-Cbl antibodies and that this recognition is completely and specifically blocked by the c-Cbl antigenic peptide. We also report that the association between Fyn and c-Cbl does not require participation of other proteins and, therefore, is direct. Furthermore, we show in this study that Fyn SH2 is involved in the interactions between Fyn and c-Cbl following the TcR/CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl. Finally, we demonstrate that in T cells, c-Cbl preferentially interacts with Fyn, whereas association between Lck and c-Cbl appears to be insignificant, regardless of whether c-Cbl is phosphorylated.DISCUSSIONThe results reported in this study indicate that the previously described Fyn-associated 116-kDa protein (p116) is a tyrosine-phosphorylated form of c-Cbl. We initially demonstrated association of Fyn and p116cbl using the immune complex kinase assay of Fyn immunoprecipitates (7Tsygankov A.Y. Broker B.M. Fargnoli J. Ledbetter J.A. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18259-18262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tsygankov A.Y. Spana C. Rowley R.B. Penhallow R.C. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7792-7800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In addition, we showed coimmunoprecipitation of Fyn and c-Cbl from the lysates of T cells labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine or [32P]orthophosphate in vivo (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). We also demonstrated that recombinant full-length Fyn binds to c-Cbl (Figs. 6, 7, 8). The interaction between Fyn and c-Cbl appears to be direct, based on their coprecipitation in the absence of additional proteins (Fig. 7, Fig. 8).Taken together with the data published earlier, our results suggest that several domains of Fyn are involved in the interaction with c-Cbl. It has been demonstrated previously that c-Cbl is capable of interacting with SH3 domains of Fyn and other Src-related kinases (26Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltoff S. Panchamoorthy G. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9115-9120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although we observed no binding of c-Cbl to isolated SH3 domains, apparently due to the high stringency of our experimental system (see Figs. 6, 7, 8), the binding of unphosphorylated c-Cbl to Fyn (Fig. 7, Fig. 8) is consistent with the involvement of Fyn SH3 domains. It appears that the c-Cbl/Fyn complex exists in unstimulated T cells, where it is likely stabilized by SH3-mediated interactions (Fig. 4). However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl increases its ability to bind to Fyn (Fig. 7). This increase is apparently caused by the interaction between Tyr(P) residue(s) of c-Cbl and Fyn SH2 domain and is observed once c-Cbl becomes tyrosine phosphorylated following TcR/CD3 ligation (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). Hence, the TcR/CD3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl is likely to promote formation of the complex between Fyn and c-Cbl in T cells. Although the TcR/CD3-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl does not necessarily increase the total amount of Fyn/c-Cbl complex, it may effectively change the type of association between c-Cbl and Fyn from primarily SH3-dependent in unstimulated T cells to primarily SH2-dependent in stimulated T cells. This alteration may render the Fyn SH3 domain and c-Cbl proline-rich regions available for interactions with other proteins in activated T cells.Interestingly, the fraction of c-Cbl found in association with Fyn in CEM.3-71 cells is relatively minor (Fig. 5 and data not shown). This finding likely reflects the fact that Fyn expression in T cells is substantially lower than that of c-Cbl (7Tsygankov A.Y. Broker B.M. Fargnoli J. Ledbetter J.A. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18259-18262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Jackman J.K. Sun Q. Olson A.L. Findell P.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21608-21613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Furthermore, the affinity of c-Cbl/Fyn interactions may not be sufficiently high to cause quantitative binding, because the fraction of Fyn-associated c-Cbl does not exceed 20%, even in the presence of an excess of recombinant Fyn (Fig. 7 and data not shown). In addition, we should note that coimmunoprecipitation of c-Cbl with Fyn from T-cell lysates may not exactly reflect the extent of their association in vivo, where intracellular conditions and/or compartmentalization may favor this association.The involvement of a SH2 domain in the interaction between Fyn and c-Cbl raises the question of specificity of their association, because numerous proteins contain SH2 domains. However, we have demonstrated previously that in spite of the ability of several Src family SH2 domains to bind to p116, tyrosine-phosphorylated p116 is found only in Fyn, but not in Lck or Yes, immune complexes from T-cell lysates (21Tsygankov A.Y. Spana C. Rowley R.B. Penhallow R.C. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7792-7800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study clearly demonstrates that both unphosphorylated and tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of c-Cbl exhibit preferential binding to Fyn, as compared to Lck (Figs. 1, 4, and 6-8 and data not shown), indicating that Fyn is a specific Src family kinase that interacts with c-Cbl in T cells. This specificity, taken together with the ability of Fyn to phosphorylate c-Cbl in immune complexes in vitro, strongly argues that Fyn is capable of phosphorylating c-Cbl in T cells. However, the possibility that other protein kinases are involved in phosphorylation of c-Cbl in vivo cannot be ruled out at the moment.It is evident that the adaptor protein Grb2 binds to c-Cbl in the cells analyzed (Figs. 6, 7, 8). It is important that Grb2 and Fyn differ with regard to the mechanism of their association with c-Cbl. Although the Fyn SH2 domain appears to be critical for c-Cbl/Fyn interactions in activated CEM.3-71 cells, binding of Grb2 SH2 to c-Cbl has not been observed, regardless of whether c-Cbl is phosphorylated (Figs. 6, 7, 8). Furthermore, Tyr(P) does not affect binding of Grb2 to c-Cbl (data not shown), consistent with the idea that this binding is not mediated by SH2-Tyr(P) interactions. These results are in agreement with the earlier reports indicating that c-Cbl primarily interacts with Grb2 SH3 domains (26Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol.

In accordance with this mechanism, the ability of c-Cbl to form a complex with Grb2 is not affected by TcR/CD3 ligation (Fig. 7).The physiological role of c-Cbl/Fyn interactions is still unclear and remains to be elucidated.

Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that c-Cbl is a Fyn-specific adaptor protein linking this tyrosine kinase to Grb2 and thus to the system of Ras activation.

However, the interactions between Fyn, c-Cbl, and Grb2 may have functions different from the regulation of Ras.

Furthermore, it has been reported recently that c-Cbl is associated with Zap tyrosine kinase in TcR/CD3-stimulated T cells (45Fournel M. Davidson D. Weil R. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is interesting that, unlike Src family kinases, Zap appears to be incapable of tyrosine phosphorylating c-Cbl, at least in COS cells. These results suggest that c-Cbl may function as a docking platform linking Zap to Ras activation and/or as an adaptor enhancing the ability of Fyn to phosphorylate Zap. However, further analysis is required to characterize the mechanism and the physiological functions of c-Cbl/Fyn interactions, as well as the involvement of other proteins in these interactions.

https://openalex.org/W1795151741,"Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is considered to be a major mediator of the inflammatory response. Recent evidence indicates that a direct physical association occurs between IL-8 receptors and the alpha subunit of guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gi(alpha)2) upon stimulation of human neutrophils by IL-8. In the present study, we identified by site-directed mutagenesis key residues within the three intracellular loops of the IL-8RA receptor involved in the interaction with Gi(alpha)2. We first systematically mutated, in groups of two to four, all the residues in the three intracellular loops of the IL-8 type A receptor to alanine and analyzed the mutant receptors transiently expressed in 293 cells. Four residues in the second intracellular loop (Y136, L137, I139, V140) and one residue in the third intracellular loop (M241) were shown to be crucial for mediating calcium signaling in response to IL-8. Other residues in the second and third intracellular loops were also found to affect IL-8RA-mediated signaling, but to a lesser extent. These effects were not due to lower expression or low IL-8 binding affinities to the mutated receptors. Mutagenesis of the residues in the first intracellular loop had only weak effects on the mobilization of calcium induced by IL-8. We then used a coimmunoprecipitation protocol with anti-Gi(alpha)2 antibodies to determine the involvement of the two regions defined above in Gi(alpha)2 coupling to IL-8 type A receptors. Whereas the anti-Gi(alpha)2 antibodies coimmunoprecipitated IL-8 receptors in the wild-type cells, this interaction was lost in cells expressing mutated receptors that affected intracellular calcium mobilization. The peptides corresponding to the regions of the type A receptor found to be critical for Gi(alpha)2 coupling and induction of intracellular calcium mobilization were next introduced into cells expressing wild-type IL-8RA or IL-8RB to assess their role in coupling Gi(alpha)2 to both IL-8 receptors. The results obtained in the latter experiments suggest that the same regions of the second intracellular loop (Y136, L137, I139, V140) and of the third intracellular loop (M241) are critically involved in the coupling of both IL-8RA and IL-8 RB to Gi(alpha)2 as well as to a downstream effector (or effectors) involved in calcium mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W2048156295,"Application of a theory of nuclear symmetry-based reaction restrictions to the O2 + O --> O3 reaction provides a potential explanation for the symmetry-induced isotopic enrichment observed for laboratory and atmospherically produced O3. Within this theory, the rate of formation of O3 from collisions of O and isotopically homonuclear O2 depends on whether the O2 molecule is in an f (allowed) or an e (restricted) parity label state. The restriction can be relaxed by various potential energy surface coupling terms, and the assumption that approximately 78 percent of the restricted O2(e) levels produce O3 with the same efficiency as the allowed O2(f) levels can account for laboratory-observed isotopic fractionation. In particular, the theory explains the special enhanced formation of the completely asymmetric isotopomer 16O17O18O."

However, little is known about the relationship between these molecular oscillators and the organism's temporal adaptation to complex daily environmental changes. We have studied the effects of nutrients on the circadian system of a marine unicellular alga and found that nitrate influences all three canonical properties of circadian rhythmicity: amplitude, phase, and period. The effects of nitrate are part of a complex feedback loop involving both circadian input and output. These new aspects of circadian nutrient metabolism have important implications for our understanding of the ecological significance of circadian programs."

https://openalex.org/W1991495521,"Cholecystokinin (CCK) has recently been shown to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (Ras-Raf-MAPK kinase-MAPK) in pancreatic acini. The mechanism by which the Gq protein-coupled CCK receptor activates Ras, however, is currently unknown. Growth factor receptors are known to activate Ras by means of adaptor proteins that bind to phosphotyrosine domains. We therefore compared the effects of CCK and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on Tyr phosphorylation of the adaptor proteins Shc and its association with Grb2 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS. Three major isoforms of Shc (p46, p52, p66) were detected in isolated rat pancreatic acini with p52 Shc being the predominant form. CCK and EGF increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shc (251 and 337% of control, respectively). CCK-stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shc as well as Shc-Grb2 complex formation was significant at 2.5 min, maximal at 5 min, and persisted for at least 30 min. Finally, SOS was found to be associated with Grb2 as assessed by probing of anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates with anti-SOS. Since MAPK in pancreatic acini is activated via protein kinase C (PKC), we studied the effect of phorbol esters on Shc phosphorylation and found 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate to be as potent as CCK. Furthermore, GF-109203X, a PKC inhibitor, abolished the effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and also the effect of CCK but not the effect of EGF on Shc tyrosyl phosphorylation. CCK-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shc was found to be phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent, and CCK did not cause EGF receptor activation.

Due to its fundamental physiological importance, regulated secretion is among the processes most intensely investigated. Granule biogenesis is known to be initiated in the TGN lumen (for reviews, see 2Tooze S.A. Chanat E. Tooze J. Huttner W.B. Peng Loh Y.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Such an aggregation, which for some regulated secretory proteins depends on the pH and pCa (13Gerdes H.-H. Rosa P.

Subsequently, the membrane-enveloped dense cores bud off, thus giving rise to immature secretory granules (2Tooze S.A. Chanat E. Tooze J. Huttner W.B. Peng Loh Y. Mechanisms of Intracellular Trafficking and Processing of Proproteins. CRC, Boca Raton, FL1993: 157Google Scholar and 3Halban P.A. Irminger J.-C. Biochem.

Kehlenbach R.H. Barr F.A. Bauerfeind R Braunling O. Corbeil D. Hannah M. Pasolli H.A. Schmidt A. Schmidt A.A. Thiele C. Wang Y. Kromer A. Gerdes H.-H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Among the secretory cell types in which the above sequence of events has been established is the rat pheochromocytoma line, PC12, where two major regulated secretory proteins, chromogranin B and secretogranin II (CgB and SgII; 19Huttner W.B.

Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), are stored within secretory granules (21Rosa P. Hille A. Lee R.W.H. Zanini A. De Camilli P. Huttner W.B. J.

A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar). PC12 cells also contain the second class of regulated secretory organelles, the synaptic-like microvesicles. These organelles are the neuroendocrine counterpart of synaptic vesicles inasmuch as they contain the same distinct set of membrane proteins (4De Camilli P. Jahn R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 625-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 5Linstedt A.D. Kelly R.B. Neuron. 1991; 7: 309-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Bauerfeind R. Huttner W.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The classical neurotransmitter taken up, stored, and released upon stimulation by PC12 synaptic-like microvesicles is acetylcholine (24Bauerfeind R. Regnier-Vigoroux A. Flatmark T. Huttner W.B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 105-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Due to the above properties, PC12 cells have been considered since their isolation as a valuable model for neurosecretion studies. Recently, their use has become even more advantageous because clonal variants have been isolated (25Shoji-Kasai Y. Yoshida A. Sato K. Hoshino T. Ogura A. Kondo S. Fujimoto Y. Kuwahara R. Kato R. Takahashi M. Science. 1992; 256: 1820-1823Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Clementi E. Racchetti G. Zacchetti D. Panzeri M.C. Meldolesi J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One of these clones, referred to as 27, was shown in a previous report from one of our laboratories to be devoid of both regulated secretory proteins and secretory granules, and to be also incompetent for catecholamine uptake, storage, and release (26Clementi E. Racchetti G. Zacchetti D. Panzeri M.C. Meldolesi J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Up until now, however, it has remained unclear whether these features of the clone were due to an overall de-differentiation, with appearance of properties of pre-neuroendocrine stem cells, or to the selective loss of the regulated secretion activity from cells otherwise maintaining a frank neuroendocrine phenotype. The experimental evidence reported in the present study demonstrates the following conclusions: i) the regulated secretion-defective PC12-27 cells express markers typical of PC12 neuroendocrine cells; ii) their defect consists in the lack of expression of many (if not all) components of secretory organelles (granules and vesicles), of the cytosol, and of the plasmalemma (tSNAREs) participating in regulated exocytosis; iii) their constitutive secretion is fully maintained; and iv) their defect is sustained not by deletion of the genes encoding the granule/vesicle proteins but by an inhibitory mechanism operating primarily at the transcriptional level.

Neurosci. 1992; 4: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (H-21) supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum in 10% CO2. For the separation of nuclei from the cytoplasm, monolayers were detached and cells homogenized by 10 passages in a Dounce apparatus while resuspended in 0.3 M sucrose. The concentration of sucrose was then brought to 1.8 M by mixing with a 2.5 M solution, and the preparation was layered over a 2 M cushion and covered with a 1.6 M cushion of sucrose in a centrifuge tube (Beckman SW41 rotor), which was filled with 0.3 M solution. After centrifugation for 2 h at 35,000 rpm, nuclei were recovered in the pellet, the cytosol in the loading cushion and microsomal membranes in the 1.6 M cushion, up to its interface with the 0.3 M sucrose. The proteins of various preparations: rat brain total homogenates, Tween 20 extracts of PC12 cells, and Triton X-100 extracts of PC12 cell crude membranes, were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed by immunoblotting as described (21Rosa P. Hille A. Lee R.W.H. Zanini A. De Camilli P. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1999-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Briefly, blotted nitrocellulose filters were incubated for 18 h at 4°C in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5% fat-free milk powder, followed by an additional incubation for 2 h at room temperature in the same buffer containing 0.3% Tween 20 and the appropriately diluted antibodies. After several washes, the filters were incubated with peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies followed by treatment with the ECL detection reagents (Amersham), carried out as recommended by the manufacturer. Cell monolayers were detached from Petri dishes by a gentle flow of Krebs-Ringer Hepes medium containing 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 6 mM glucose, 25 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4). Cell suspensions were gently washed three times by centrifugation, resuspended, and incubated for 30 min at 37°C in Krebs-Ringer Hepes medium supplemented with the Ca2+-sensitive dye, fura-2, administered as acetoxymethylester at the final concentration of 5 μM. Cell aliquots (4 × 106 cells) were finally transferred to a thermostatted cuvette (37°C) in a Perkin Elmer LS-5B fluorimeter, where they were maintained under continuous stirring, and analyzed as described (44Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Traces are representative of results obtained in three different experiments. RNA extraction was performed according to the single-step method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (45Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar) on cells grown in standard conditions or treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D, for 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. For RT-PCR amplification of cDNA, the PCR primers were as follows (forward and reverse): 5′-GGTGAGTGCCAGTCATCC-3′ (position 528-545 bp) and 5′-GCCACTCCTCGGTCACAT-3′ (1286-1303 bp) for synaptotagmin I (EMBL data base sequence X52772, 1990), 5′-CCAGACCTCAGATTGGAGAA-3′ (148-167 bp) and 5′CCGACCACATCTTCATAGG-3′ (755-773 bp) for SgII (X13618, 1988), 5′-GCTAC-CGCTGCCACCGTC-3′ (27-44 bp) and 5′-GGTGATGGGAACCTCAGGAA-3′ (604-623 bp) for VAMP2 (M24105, 1989), 5′-CCTTCAGGCTGCACCAGT-3′ (244-262 bp), and 5′-GCTGGCTGCCCGTAATCG-3′ (854-871 bp) for synaptophysin (X06388, 1987). First strand cDNA synthesis was conducted using an oligo(dT) primer according to the standard protocol (46Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RT-PCR products were obtained after 35 cycles of the following conditions: denaturation for 1 min at 94°C, annealing for 30 s at 61°C, and extension for 45 s at 72°C using 1 unit of Taq polymerase/30 μl (Perkin Elmer, Ampli-Taq kit). For Northern blotting, probes were prepared from RT-PCR fragments isolated from polyacrylamide gel by the “crush and soak” method (46Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Redivue, Amersham) by random-priming oligolabeling (47Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5193) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA of each PC12 clone were separated on 1% agarose, 2.2 M formaldehyde denaturing gel and transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N Amersham). Hybridizations were carried out at 65°C in a mix containing 125 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM NaCl, 7% SDS, 10% polyethylene glycol, 1% bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 106 cpm/ml radiolabeled probe. Washes were performed at 65°C first in 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS, then twice in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min before film exposure. Northern blot signals were normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA detected as described (48Corradi A. Croci L. Stayton C.L. Gulisano M. Boncinelli E. Consalez G.G. Genomics. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription rate of the SgII gene was evaluated by run-on experiments carried out with nuclei from PC12-27 and control cells, processed as described in 49Marzluff W.F. Huang R.C.C. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Transcription and Translation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 89Google Scholar, using the specific cDNA. Control cell clones and subclones were grown in 24-well plates until near confluence. The cells were then labeled overnight with 100 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate as described (50Rosa P. Mantovani S. Rosboch R. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For long term stimulations, before their labeling with [35S]sulfate, the cells were treated for up to 4 days with either 55 mM KCl, 20 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or 1 mM dibutyryl-cAMP. For pulse and pulse-chase experiments the cells were labeled either for 7 min with 500 μCi/ml Trans 35S-label or for 15 min with 300 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate and then chased for 0, 10, 20, and 60 min in a medium containing 1.6 mM Na2SO4. For the analyses of regulated secretion, PC12-251 and −27 cells were labeled for either 3 h or 15 min, then washed and transferred to prewarmed medium containing 5 or 55 mM KCl. After a 10-min incubation, the media were collected, cleared by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 13,000 rpm at 4°C, and stored at −20°C after the addition of a protease inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml bestatin). The cells were solubilized in ice-cold 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, additioned with 10 mM EDTA, 0.3% Tween 20, 150 mM NaCl, and supplemented with 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and with pepstatin plus bestatin (2 μg/ml each). Before use, the cell lysates were centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 3 min at 4°C. The cDNA encoding hCgB (51Benedum U.M. Lamouroux A. Konecki D.S. Rosa P. Hille A. Baeuerle P.A. Frank R. Lottspeich F. Mallet J. Huttner W.B EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) was cloned downstream of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter inside a pREP4 vector carrying the hygromycin B resistance gene, using standard procedures (46Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transfection of PC12-27 was performed by electroporation using a Gene Pulser transfection apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy). Cell suspensions (∼4 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated at room temperature with 25 μg of hCgBpREP4-DNA and then electroporated with a capacitor discharge of 250 V and 960 microfarads. Cells were then diluted to 1 × 105/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with serum and plated in 4 × 10-cm dishes (1 × 106 cells/dish). The selection of hygromycin B-resistant cells was started 48 h after the electroporation using 450 μg/ml antibiotic. After 15 days, individual clones were transferred into 24-well plates and grown to sufficient density to screen for hCgB (see below). The stably transfected clones were cultured in the continuous presence of hygromycin B (450 μg/ml). Cleared cell lysates and media were diluted in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, containing either 0.3% or 1% Triton X-100) and incubated overnight at 4°C with the appropriate concentrations of specific antisera followed by incubation for 1 h with 15 μl (packaged gel) of protein A conjugated to Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The immunoprecipitates thus obtained, as well as aliquots of the cleared cell lysates and media, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography, as described previously (21Rosa P. Hille A. Lee R.W.H. Zanini A. De Camilli P. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1999-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Fluorograms were quantitated by densitometric scanning using an LKB Ultroscan (Pharmacia). Values are expressed as the percent of the hCgB or heparan sulfate proteoglycan present in the cleared cell lysates at the end of the 15-min pulse. PC12 cells were plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips, grown for 2-4 days, and then analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence (22Rosa P. Weiss U. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Niehrs C. Stelzer E.H.K. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For electron microscopy, cell monolayers were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 30 min at 4°C with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3), post-fixed in 2% OsO4, scraped from the dishes, pelleted, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon as described (52Bassetti M. Lodi Pasini D. Rosa P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thin sections, cut using an Ultra-Cut “E” microtome (Reichert-Jung, Wien, Austria), were examined with a Philips 400 electron microscope. For immunoelectron microscopy the cells, fixed with aldehydes as above, were scraped from the dishes and sedimented. The pellets were included in 10% gelatine, fixed for an additional 60 min, and then sliced into small pieces, which were passed t"

Microwave radiation is used to drive spectroscopic transitions, and electric field dissociation of the weakly bound levels provides a high degree of state selection for sensitive detection of the spectra. The analysis of the spectra requires unconventional approaches to the description of the long-range levels and their spectroscopic study and provides stringent tests of ab initio theories."

Two of the antibodies selectively recognize 1,4-DNB crystal surfaces in an appropriately modified ELISA. They do not interact either with 1,4-DNB/BSA conjugates or with polystyrene and cholesterol monohydrate surfaces. They do interact with 1,2-DNB crystal surfaces, albeit with much lower reactivity. It is consequently suggested that these antibodies are not specific to the DNB molecule but rather to a repetitive motif of molecular moieties exposed at the crystal surfaces. Characterization of their binding regions may help to elucidate the interactions of antibodies with solid substrates and, in general, with antigens exposed on biological and artificial surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2031249134,"A surprising discovery in x-ray astronomy was that clusters of galaxies often contain vast quantities of hot (20 million kelvin) diffuse gas. Substantial diffuse extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emission has recently been detected in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. Depending on the character of the interstellar medium in our galaxy, this emission could be either an aspect of the hot cluster gas or a previously undetected 500,000-kelvin component. Analysis of the observational data in combination with our current knowledge of the interstellar medium revealed that the EUV flux cannot be an effect of the interstellar medium. Hence, a warm cluster component appears likely."

Tower J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 801-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The typical eukaryotic cell contains from several hundred (in vertebrates) to several thousand (in plants) rRNA genes organized in head-to-tail tandem arrays located at one or a few chromosomal sites (2Long E.O. Dawid I.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 727-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Each rDNA repeating unit consists of the transcribed pre-rRNA region and an intergenic spacer (IGS), whose length varies considerably (e.g. from ∼2.5 kb in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3Skryabin K.G. Eldarov M.A. Larionov V.L. Bayev A.A. Klootwijk J. de Regt V.C. Veldman G.M. Planta R.J. Georgiev O.I. Hadjiolov A.

Genomics. 1995; 27: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)). Within a given species, and even within the individual rDNA repeats of a single organism, the length of the IGS may be polymorphic (e.g. ∼3 kb to ∼9 kb in Xenopus laevis (5Wellauer P.K. Reeder R.H. Carroll D. Brown D.D. Deutch A. Higashinakagawa T. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2823-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)). In all cases examined, this length polymorphism is due to differences in the numbers of repetitive sequence elements (6Erickson J.M. Schmickel R.D. Am. J. Hum.

Indeed, all metazoan organisms for which sequence information is available have one or more types of reiterated sequence elements that constitute a substantial portion of their promoter-proximal IGSs.The IGS of X. laevis rDNA is composed almost entirely of four types of repeated elements (Fig. 1) (11Boseley P. Moss T. Mächler M. Portmann R. Birnstiel M. Cell. 1979; 17: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Moss T. Boseley P.G. Birnstiel M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 467-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The promoter-proximal portion of the IGS consists of blocks of 60/81-bp repeats (6-12 copies of 60- or 81-bp elements) that alternate with a pol I spacer promoter (SP). This unit is generally repeated two to three times/spacer, but can be repeated up to eight times. The SP is ∼90% identical to the gene promoter (−140 to −1) and the 60/81-bp repeats have ∼80% identity to 50 bp of the gene promoter (−121 to −72) (11Boseley P. Moss T. Mächler M. Portmann R. Birnstiel M. Cell. 1979; 17: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Sollner-Webb B. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1979; 18: 485-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The promoter-distal portion of the X. laevis IGS consists of “0” repeats, 34-bp elements reiterated ∼2-10 times/spacer, and “1” repeats, 100-bp elements reiterated ∼six to nine times/spacer (11Boseley P. Moss T. Mächler M. Portmann R. Birnstiel M. Cell. 1979; 17: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Moss T. Boseley P.G. Birnstiel M.

Cell. 1977; 11: 599-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The promoter-proximal portion of the X. laevis IGS can substantially affect transcription from the rRNA gene promoter (15Busby S.J. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1983; 34: 989-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Moss T. Nature. 1983; 302: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The 60/81-bp repeats are pol I transcriptional enhancers because they function in both orientations and over considerable distances to stimulate transcription from an rDNA promoter located in cis, relative to one on a separate DNA molecule (17Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 285-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Labhart P. Reeder R.H.

The 60/81-bp repeats can also stimulate a promoter in cis in the absence of a competitor template (20Pape L.K. Windle J.J. Mougey E.B. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5093-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and their cis-stimulatory and trans-competitive effects can each be ∼10-fold (17Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 285-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Pape L.K. Windle J.J. Mougey E.B. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5093-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the SP does not stimulate transcription from the gene promoter by itself, it potentiates the enhancement observed from the 60/81-bp repeats, in a process that is not yet understood (21De Winter R.F.J. Moss T. Cell. 1986; 44: 313-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22De Winter R.F.J. Moss T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).In contrast to the transcriptional effects of the promoter-proximal repetitive elements, previous studies have concluded that the promoter-distal region of the X. laevis rDNA IGS containing the 0 repeats and the 1 repeats had no appreciable effect on transcription (19Reeder R.H. Roan J.G. Dunaway M. Cell. 1983; 35: 449-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22De Winter R.F.J. Moss T. J. Mol.

However, the assays used in these experiments were considerably less sensitive than those used to demonstrate the effects of the promoter proximal elements, and they might not have detected the effects of the 60/81-bp repeats either. This report re-examines the transcriptional role of the 0/1 repetitive elements.Following the X. laevis paradigm, the promoter-proximal repetitive elements of the rDNA IGS in mouse (24Kuhn A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the promoter-proximal spacer promoter repeats in Drosophila (28Grimaldi G. Di Nocera P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5502-5506Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Grimaldi G. Fiorentini P. Di Nocera P.P. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the promoter-proximal spacer promoter and/or repetitive elements in rat (31Cassidy B.G. Yang-Yen H.-F. Rothblum L.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2766-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have been found to stimulate transcription from the respective cis-located gene promoters, much as in frog. Thus, there are many examples of promoter-proximal rDNA repeats acting to stimulate pol I transcription.Using oocyte microinjection assays under conditions that can separately detect cis stimulation and trans competition, we have directly examined the effects of the promoter-distal half of the X. laevis IGS. We show that the 0 repeats, the 1 repeats, and the combined 0/1 repeats can significantly influence transcription from the rRNA gene promoter. In cis, these repeats serve as potent enhancers of both spacer promoter and gene promoter transcription, acting independent of orientation and over distances, both upstream and downstream of the initiation site. When located in trans, these promoter-distal repetitive elements instead act as inhibitors of transcription. By footprint competition, the 0 and 1 repeats were found to specifically interact with a factor that binds to the rDNA promoter; gel shift analysis indicates that the pol I transcription factor UBF can bind to these sequences. Thus, all of the criteria that establish the 60/81-bp repeats as pol I transcriptional enhancers also apply to the promoter-distal 0/1 transcriptional enhancers, indicating that virtually the entire X. laevis IGS consists of repetitive elements that enhance ribosomal transcription.DISCUSSIONThe X. laevis 0 and 1 spacer repeats are enhancers of pol I transcription. The X. laevis rDNA intergenic spacer consists almost entirely of four kinds of repeated elements. The promoter-proximal portion contains the 60/81-bp enhancer repeats and spacer promoters, both of which serve to stimulate pol I transcription, while the promoter-distal portion contains two other types of repeats, the 0 and 1 repeats (11Boseley P. Moss T. Mächler M. Portmann R. Birnstiel M. Cell. 1979; 17: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 23Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 38: 349-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 47Moss T. Mitchelson K. De Winter R. Oxford Survey on Eukaryotic Genes. Vol 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford, England1985: 207Google Scholar). We report here that the 0/1 repeats, as well as the individual 0 and 1 repeats, are enhancers of pol I transcription and exhibit all of the known properties of the 60/81-bp enhancers (17Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 285-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Reeder R.H. Roan J.G. Dunaway M. Cell. 1983; 35: 449-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Pape L.K. Windle J.J. Mougey E.B. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5093-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The 0, 1, and 0/1 repeats stimulate transcription from a promoter when located in cis (Fig. 3, A and B), when in the reverse orientation relative to the promoter (Fig. 3B), when moved hundreds of bp upstream from the promoter (Fig. 4A), and when located within the transcribed region downstream from the promoter (Fig. 4B). They also stimulate transcription from a promoter in cis relative to that from a coinjected promoter in trans (Fig. 7A). Thus, virtually the entire multikilobase X. laevis IGS is made up of pol I enhancer repeats.The extent of cis stimulation afforded a pol I promoter by the 0 and 1 repeats increases with an increasing number of repeats until the saturation level is approached (Fig. 5). This saturation point varies between individual frogs, a phenomenon also observed with the 60/81-bp enhancers (20Pape L.K. Windle J.J. Mougey E.B. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5093-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 42Pikaard C.S. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4282-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Notably, the level of cis stimulation afforded by the 0 and 1 repeats is comparable to and in most frogs somewhat greater than that afforded by similarly positioned 60/81-bp enhancer repeats, on a per length basis.In oocytes from individuals in which the maximal level of enhanced transcription is very high relative to the level from the promoter alone, we also observe that the 0/1 repeats in their natural promoter-distal location in the IGS stimulate transcription from the downstream gene promoter, above the level directed by the intervening promoter-proximal 60/81-bp enhancers and spacer promoter (Fig. 7B). In the mature oocytes of other frogs, the level of gene promoter transcription appears maximal with a single 60/81-bp block and no additional stimulation from the more distal spacer promoter and 0/1 repeats is observed (data not shown). This presumably explains why previous studies concluded that the 0 and 1 repetitive elements do not exert a significant transcriptional effect (19Reeder R.H. Roan J.G. Dunaway M. Cell. 1983; 35: 449-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22De Winter R.F.J. Moss T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 38: 349-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These conclusions were based entirely on the type of experiment of Fig. 7B, where detection of stimulation by the distal 0/1 repeats is frog-dependent; in the oocytes examined, the maximal level of transcription may have been reached in the absence of the 0/1 region. These early studies did not specifically examine the promoter-distal repeats in experiments like those of Fig. 3-7.How Might the 0 and 1 Repeats Function?In trans competition assays, the subcloned 0, 1, and 0/1 enhancer repeats inhibit transcription from a coinjected ribosomal promoter on a separate plasmid molecule (Fig. 6), as do the 60/81-bp enhancer repeats (17Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 285-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Pape L.K. Windle J.J. Mougey E.B. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5093-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that both types of enhancers may bind a pol I transcription factor (see also 23Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 38: 349-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar and 48Paule M.R. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 83Google Scholar). This hypothesis was strengthened by the finding that formation of a footprint on the rDNA promoter that is diagnostic for a stable transcription complex is specifically inhibited by the 0, 1, and 0/1 repeats (Fig. 8), as well as by the 60/81-bp repeats, but not by various nonspecific DNAs. Additionally, the 1 repeats exhibit a strong sequence identity with the upstream domain of the rRNA gene promoter (Fig. 10A; a 63-bp segment of >75% identity), suggesting that a common factor may bind to the promoter and to the enhancers. The 60/81-bp repeats show a comparable extent of sequence homology with the central region of the rRNA gene promoter (a 43-bp segment of ∼80% identity (−114 to −72); 11Boseley P. Moss T. Mächler M.

Cell. 1979; 18: 485-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar); and an artificially polymerized version of the central region of the rRNA gene promoter can function as a pol I enhancer (49Pikaard C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Fig. 10The 0 and 1 repeats have sequence identity to regions of the gene promoter and to elements in the IGSs of other Xenopus species. Panel A, the program BESTFIT of the GCG package was used to identify a >75% identity between residues −167 to −105 of the X. laevis rDNA promoter (13Sollner-Webb B. Reeder R.H.

BESTFIT analysis showed the X. borealis region designated 0 to have 100% identity within the 0 repeats of X. laevis, and the X. borealis region 2 to have a >70% identity within the X. laevis 1 repeats. Identities between the E region of X. borealis and the 60/81-bp repeats of X. laevis, as well as between the spacer and gene promoters of X. borealis and X. laevis have been noted (47Moss T.

Since analogous assays show that UBF can bind similarly to the 0 and the 1 repeats (Fig. 9), UBF is also a candidate for mediating the action of the 0 and 1 enhancers. However, competition studies using footprinting, gel shift, and UV cross-linking do not reveal the extent of binding specificity for UBF to the promoter or to any of the enhancers, as is typical for pol II transcription factors (51Hu C.H.

Pikaard C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6476-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it appears that UBF alone may not mediate transcriptional enhancement, and it remains to be proven whether UBF is indeed directly relevant to the in vivo action of pol I enhancers, both the 60/81-bp repeats and the 0 and 1 repeats.Are Promoter-distal Repetitive Enhancers More General?The promoter-distal intergenic spacer of Xenopus borealis rDNA contains extensive repetitive regions that have a high degree of sequence identity to the 0 and 1 repeats of X. laevis. There is >70% identity over a 70-bp region of a sequence that is repeated nine times in the X. borealis IGS region 2 with the X. laevis 1 repeat (Fig. 10B, bottom). There is also 100% identity between a 13-bp sequence that is repeated three times in the more promoter-distal X. borealis IGS and sequences of the X. laevis 0 repeat (Fig. 10B, top). Furthermore, there is 70% identity between a 28-bp sequence that is repeated four times in the promoter-distal X. clivii IGS (57Bach R. Allet B. Crippa M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5311-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and sequences of the X. laevis 0 repeat (Fig. 10B, top). These repetitive elements in the spacers of other Xenopus species that have sequence identities to the 0 and 1 repeats may also be promoter-distal enhancers of pol I transcription. Furthermore, in mouse, Drosophila, Arabidopsis, and Acanthamoeba where promoter-proximal repetitive enhancers have been demonstrated, there are also more promoter-distal repetitive elements (26Doelling J.H.

INTRODUCTIONEukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) constitutes 75% of total cellular RNA and is synthesized by RNA polymerase I (pol I) 1The abbreviations used are: pol Ipolymerase IIGSintergenic spacerkbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)DTTdithiothreitolSPspacer promoter. as a precursor to the 18, 5.8, and 28 S RNAs of the ribosome (1Sollner-Webb B. Tower J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 801-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The typical eukaryotic cell contains from several hundred (in vertebrates) to several thousand (in plants) rRNA genes organized in head-to-tail tandem arrays located at one or a few chromosomal sites (2Long E.O. Dawid I.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 727-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Each rDNA repeating unit consists of the transcribed pre-rRNA region and an intergenic spacer (IGS), whose length varies considerably (e.g. from ∼2.5 kb in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3Skryabin K.G. Eldarov M.A. Larionov V.L. Bayev A.A. Klootwijk J. de Regt V.C. Veldman G.M. Planta R.J. Georgiev O.I. Hadjiolov A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2955-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to ∼30 kb in humans (4Gonzalez I.L. Sylvester J.E. Genomics. 1995; 27: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)). Within a given species, and even within the individual rDNA repeats of a single organism, the length of the IGS may be polymorphic (e.g. ∼3 kb to ∼9 kb in Xenopus laevis (5Wellauer P.K. Reeder R.H. Carroll D. Brown D.D. Deutch A. Higashinakagawa T. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2823-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)). In all cases examined, this length polymorphism is due to differences in the numbers of repetitive sequence elements (6Erickson J.M. Schmickel R.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1985; 37: 311-325PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gerlach W.L. Bedbrook J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1858-1869Crossref Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 8Long E.O. Dawid I.B.

Indeed, all metazoan organisms for which sequence information is available have one or more types of reiterated sequence elements that constitute a substantial portion of their promoter-proximal IGSs.The IGS of X. laevis rDNA is composed almost entirely of four types of repeated elements (Fig. 1) (11Boseley P. Moss T. Mächler M. Portmann R. Birnstiel M. Cell. 1979; 17: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Moss T. Boseley P.G. Birnstiel M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 467-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The promoter-proximal portion of the IGS consists of blocks of 60/81-bp repeats (6-12 copies of 60- or 81-bp elements) that alternate with a pol I spacer promoter (SP). This unit is generally repeated two to three times/spacer, but can be repeated up to eight times. The SP is ∼90% identical to the gene promoter (−140 to −1) and the 60/81-bp repeats have ∼80% identity to 50 bp of the gene promoter (−121 to −72) (11Boseley P. Moss T. Mächler M. Portmann R. Birnstiel M. Cell. 1979; 17: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Sollner-Webb B. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1979; 18: 485-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The promoter-distal portion of the X. laevis IGS consists of “0” repeats, 34-bp elements reiterated ∼2-10 times/spacer, and “1” repeats, 100-bp elements reiterated ∼six to nine times/spacer (11Boseley P. Moss T. Mächler M. Portmann R. Birnstiel M. Cell. 1979; 17: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Moss T. Boseley P.G. Birnstiel M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 467-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Botchan P. Reeder R.H. Dawid I.B. Cell. 1977; 11: 599-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The promoter-proximal portion of the X. laevis IGS can substantially affect transcription from the rRNA gene promoter (15Busby S.J. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1983; 34: 989-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Moss T. Nature. 1983; 302: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The 60/81-bp repeats are pol I transcriptional enhancers because they function in both orientations and over considerable distances to stimulate transcription from an rDNA promoter located in cis, relative to one on a separate DNA molecule (17Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 285-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8999-9009Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Reeder R.H. Roan J.G. Dunaway M. Cell. 1983; 35: 449-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The 60/81-bp repeats can also stimulate a promoter in cis in the absence of a competitor template (20Pape L.K. Windle J.J. Mougey E.B. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5093-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and their cis-stimulatory and trans-competitive effects can each be ∼10-fold (17Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 285-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Pape L.K. Windle J.J. Mougey E.B. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5093-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the SP does not stimulate transcription from the gene promoter by itself, it potentiates the enhancement observed from the 60/81-bp repeats, in a process that is not yet understood (21De Winter R.F.J. Moss T. Cell. 1986; 44: 313-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22De Winter R.F.J. Moss T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).In contrast to the transcriptional effects of the promoter-proximal repetitive elements, previous studies have concluded that the promoter-distal region of the X. laevis rDNA IGS containing the 0 repeats and the 1 repeats had no appreciable effect on transcription (19Reeder R.H. Roan J.G. Dunaway M. Cell. 1983; 35: 449-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22De Winter R.F.J. Moss T. J. Mol.

However, the assays used in these experiments were considerably less sensitive than those used to demonstrate the effects of the promoter proximal elements, and they might not have detected the effects of the 60/81-bp repeats either. This report re-examines the transcriptional role of the 0/1 repetitive elements.Following the X. laevis paradigm, the promoter-proximal repetitive elements of the rDNA IGS in mouse (24Kuhn A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the promoter-proximal spacer promoter repeats in Drosophila (28Grimaldi G. Di Nocera P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5502-5506Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Grimaldi G. Fiorentini P. Di Nocera P.P. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the promoter-proximal spacer promoter and/or repetitive elements in rat (31Cassidy B.G. Yang-Yen H.-F. Rothblum L.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2766-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have been found to stimulate transcription from the respective cis-located gene promoters, much as in frog. Thus, there are many examples of promoter-proximal rDNA repeats acting to stimulate pol I transcription.Using oocyte microinjection assays under conditions that can separately detect cis stimulation and trans competition, we have directly examined the effects of the promoter-distal half of the X. laevis IGS. We show that the 0 repeats, the 1 repeats, and the combined 0/1 repeats can significantly influence transcription from the rRNA gene promoter. In cis, these repeats serve as potent enhancers of both spacer promoter and gene promoter transcription, acting independent of orientation and over distances, both upstream and downstream of the initiation site. When located in trans, these promoter-distal repetitive elements instead act as inhibitors of transcription. By footprint competition, the 0 and 1 repeats were found to specifically interact with a factor that binds to the rDNA promoter; gel shift analysis indicates that the pol I transcription factor UBF can bind to these sequences. Thus, all of the criteria that establish the 60/81-bp repeats as pol I transcriptional enhancers also apply to the promoter-distal 0/1 transcriptional enhancers, indicating that virtually the entire X. laevis IGS consists of repetitive elements that enhance ribosomal transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2085594956,"Previously, we demonstrated that when two human hepatoma cell lines, Hep3B and HepG2, were exposed to gemfibrozil, a hypolipidemic drug, a 2-fold induction in apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) mRNA levels resulted. To determine if mRNA stabilization was responsible for the changes in apoA-I mRNA levels, the half-lives for apoA-I mRNA were measured in the presence of actinomycin D with and without gemfibrozil. These experiments revealed no differences in stability. However, nuclear run-off assays indicated that the transcription rate of the apoA-I gene was increased 2-fold in gemfibrozil-treated cells. Transient transfection experiments also indicated that the induction of apoA-I mRNA level in response to gemfibrozil is mediated at the transcriptional level. We have identified two copies of the “drug-responsive element” (DRE) in the apoA-I promoter region that may be responsible for the increase in apoA-I transcriptional activity by gemfibrozil. Using gel mobility shift assays with a synthetic DRE oligonucleotide, we have demonstrated that exposure of Hep3B and HepG2 cells to gemfibrozil resulted in strong induction of a protein-DNA complex. The formation of this complex is highly sequence-specific as indicated by the DNA competition experiments. The drug-inducible nuclear proteins bind to the DRE of the human apoA-I gene with an apparent Kd of 4.1 nM. Methylation interference experiments have localized the contact sites of nuclear factors to the DRE region. Southwestern blot analyses have identified two groups of drug-inducible nuclear proteins with molecular masses of approximately 30 and 15 kDa. When a copy of synthetic DRE oligonucleotide was inserted upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter and luciferase reporter construct, a significant 2-fold induction in luciferase activity was observed in the presence of gemfibrozil following transient transfection of two human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 and Hep3B. However, a plasmid containing one copy of mutated apoA-I-DRE oligomer did not confer responsiveness to gemfibrozil treatment. Furthermore, pGL2 (apoA-I −250 mutant DRE), which carried an internal mutation of the DRE in the human apoA-I proximal promoter region, showed no increase in luciferase activity in response to gemfibrozil. These results implicate protein-DNA interactions at the DRE region in the transcriptional induction of human apoA-I gene expression by gemfibrozil.

Pownall H.J. Havel R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that apoA-I, together with lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, promotes cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues and carries the excess cholesterol to the liver for catabolism (1Gotto A.M. Pownall H.J. Havel R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 2Miller N.E. LaVille A. Crook D.

This process is known as “reverse cholesterol transport.” Epidemiological and genetic studies have indicated that levels of plasma HDL are inversely correlated with atherosclerotic risk (4Gordon T.

There are a number of drugs widely used for reducing the progression of coronary heart diseases by altering lipoprotein metabolism. One of the most extensively studied is gemfibrozil. The Helsinki Heart Study (10Frick M.H. Elo O. Haapa K. Heinonen O.P. Heinsalmi P. Helo P. Huttunen J.K. Kaitaniemi P. Koskinen P. Mannien V. Maenpaa H. Malkonen M. Manttari M. Norola S. Pasternack A. Pikkarainen J. Romo M. Sjoblom T. Nikkila E.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 34: 74-82Google Scholar) demonstrated that the elevation of HDL cholesterol resulting from use of this drug had a more protective effect in reducing atherosclerotic risk than the lowering of LDL cholesterol. Recently, we have demonstrated that exposure of two human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 and Hep3B, to gemfibrozil resulted in a 2-fold induction of apoA-I mRNA (11Tam S.-P. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 91: 51-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cis- and trans-acting elements involved in apoA-I gene transcription have been extensively studied (12Sastry K.N. Seedorf V. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Widom R.L. Ladias J.A.A. Kouidou S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1991; 266: 5790-5797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on transient transfection studies, it was concluded that the DNA region located between nucleotides −256 and −41 upstream from the transcription start site (+1) of the human apoA-I gene contains regulatory elements that are necessary and sufficient for maximal expression in HepG2 cells (12Sastry K.N. Seedorf V. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This DNA region acts as a powerful liver-specific enhancer (13Widom R.L. Ladias J.A.A. Kouidou S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which drugs such as gemfibrozil regulate apoA-I mRNA levels has not been determined. Evidence summarized below suggests that expression of the apoA-I gene may be influenced directly by drug-induced transcription factors. It is well known that the cytochrome P-450 system is responsible for the metabolism of a variety of drugs (15Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1988; 40: 243-288PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of the CYP1A1 gene is mediated by the interaction of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) together with its ligand to several DNA recognition sites within a dioxin-responsive enhancer upstream of the CYP1A1 gene (16Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 251-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 17Fujisawa-Sehara A. Yamane M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). While examining the structure of the human apoA-I gene promoter a sequence match with the 5′-flanking region of the CYP1A1 gene was detected (19Sogawa K. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Yamane M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8044-8048Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The match involves a decanucleotide motif, 5′-(G/C)(N(T/G)(A/G)GCTGGG-3′, corresponding to a putative drug response element (DRE) first identified by Fujii-Kuriyama and co-workers (19Sogawa K. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Yamane M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8044-8048Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It was suggested initially that this element may be recognized by the AhR. This has now been shown not to be the case. At present, factors that bind to the element have not been identified, and its role in mediating induction in response to inducers of the dioxin type remains unclear. Two copies of the element, spaced 10 nucleotides apart in an inverted repeat, are present in the human apoA-I promoter between nucleotides −77 and −45, relative to the transcription start site of the gene. One of the elements is a 100% match with the DRE consensus, and the other is a 90% match. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a polymorphism of the human apoA-I promoter region at 75 bp (a guanine to adenine substitution) upstream from the transcription start site of the gene is associated with elevated levels of HDL cholesterol and apoA-I (20Pagani F.

Invest. 1992; 89: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This genotype was also greatly affected by smoking (22Sigurdsson Jr., G. Gudnason V. Sigurdsson G. Humphries S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we describe experiments showing that gemfibrozil can induce a group of nuclear proteins in Hep3B and HepG2 cells and that these factors bind specifically and with high affinity to the DRE region of human apoA-I gene. Transient transfection assays also demonstrate that the DRE is necessary for gemfibrozil-mediated induction of human apoA-I gene expression. Complementary pairs of oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Biosearch model 8600 DNA synthesizer at Queen's University, Department of Biochemistry, Core Facility for Protein/DNA Chemistry.

Open table in a new tab Human hepatoma cell lines, Hep3B and HepG2, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Maryland). Cells were grown in T75 flasks containing 20 ml of Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as described previously (23Tam S.-P. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1992; 16: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Freshly confluent monolayers were washed twice with MEM and then incubated with fresh medium for 24 h in the presence of gemfibrozil, dissolved in ethanol, to give a final concentration of 40 μg/ml. Control cells were incubated with an equal volume (20 μl) of ethanol. In some experiments, gemfibrozil and cycloheximide were added to the cells to give final concentrations of 40 and 10 μg/ml, respectively. Where noted, Hep3B or HepG2 cells were also treated with or without gemfibrozil and in the presence of actinomycin D, ranging from 0.625 to 10.0 μg/ml, for various time periods as described in the figure legends. Cell viability was routinely monitored by trypan blue exclusion and lactate dehydrogenase leakage as described previously (23Tam S.-P. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1992; 16: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In all experiments the number of dead cells never exceeded 5% of the total number of cells. Total cellular RNA was isolated by extraction with guanidine-HCl, as described (11Tam S.-P. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 91: 51-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For Northern blotting, 20 μg of total RNA were denatured by treatment with glyoxal, subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, and transferred to Zeta-probe GT membrane (Bio-Rad) as described previously (11Tam S.-P. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 91: 51-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Blots were prehybridized and hybridized with nick-translated apoA-I and β-actin cDNA probes as described (18Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). β-actin was used as an internal control, since its cognate mRNA levels are not affected by gemfibrozil (11Tam S.-P. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 91: 51-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All results were normalized using densitometric scans of Northern blots probed with radiolabeled β-actin to correct for loading variations. Nuclei were prepared according to the method of Bartalena et al. (24Bartalena L. Farsetti A. Flink I.L. Robbins J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Isolated nuclei were resuspended in storage buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 MD-sorbitol, 2.5% Ficoll, 50% glycerol, 10 mM spermidine, 20 mM DTT, 0.4 units/ml RNasin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at concentration of 2-3 × 108 nuclei/ml. An in vitro nuclear run-off transcription assay was carried out as described (24Bartalena L. Farsetti A. Flink I.L. Robbins J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (25Tam S.-P. Deeley R.G. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 105: 235-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Specific gene transcripts were quantified by hybridization to filter-bound DNA. The recombinant pBS apoA-I used in this study was prepared by ligating the 0.6-kb human apoA-I insert from pkT apoA-I into the PstI site of the pBS vector. Preparation of Zeta-probe GT nylon filters was as outlined (24Bartalena L. Farsetti A. Flink I.L. Robbins J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hybridization, washing, and elution of bound, labeled RNA were carried out as described previously (26McKnight G.S. Palmiter R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9050-9058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific hybridization to each filter was determined by carrying out transcription with labeled pGEM 3Z control vector. The relative rates of transcription were calculated in terms of parts per million, after subtraction of control values. Total incorporation into RNA per assay ranged from 1 × 107 dpm to 5 × 107 dpm, all of which was used for each hybridization selection. Throughout the analysis, 3H sense strand RNAs produced by transcription with Sp6 polymerase were used to normalize for differences in hybridization efficiency. The efficiency ranged from 30 to 35%. Hep3B and HepG2 cells were grown as described above, and 3-6 × 108 cells were used to prepare nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modification of the method of Dignam et al. (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9128) Google Scholar). The modification was as follows: cells were suspended in 2 volumes of buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and incubated on ice for 15 min. The swelled cells were then passed through a 231/2-gauge needle five times followed by a 261/2-gauge needle for another five strokes instead of using a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclear extracts were dialyzed against binding buffer (25 mM HEPES at pH 8.0, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 20% glycerol, and 50 mM KCl) and stored as aliquots at −80°C. Nuclear protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For mobility shift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with 100 μg of poly (dI-dC) in binding buffer containing 5 mM DTT and 5 μM ZnCl2 on ice for 30 min. Then 2 fmol (10,000 cpm) 5′-end-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the drug response element or other consensus binding elements were added to the reaction mixtures and incubated on ice for another 30 min. Free DNA and protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris, 5 mM sodium acetate and 2.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.2. The gel was preelectrophoresed at 80 V for 1 h. The samples were then loaded onto the gel and electrophoresed at 80 V for 4-6 h at 4°C. Gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to Kodak x-ray film at −80°C with a DuPont Hi-plus intensifying screen. Competition assays were performed by adding the unlabeled competitor DNA 15 min prior to the addition of labeled DNA as indicated in the figure legends. The band representing the protein-DNA complex was identified by autoradiography, excised from the gel, and quantitated by Cerenkov counting. Equal volumes of nuclear extract and sample buffer (5% SDS, 5 mM Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, and 0.5% pyronin Y) were mixed and subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel at room temperature. Protein samples were electrotransferred to a Millipore Immobilon P membrane in 25 mM Tris-HCl, 192 mM glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, and 0.002% SDS at room temperature for 4 h. Hybridization of 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotides to nuclear proteins immobilized on the membrane was performed according to the method of Singh and co-workers (29Singh H. Clerc R.G. LeBowitz J.H. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar). A 491-bp DNA fragment of the human apoA-I promoter between nucleotides −491 and +1 was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers were made complementary to the apoA-I gene between nucleotides −491 and −460 and between nucleotides −25 and +1, respectively. PCR amplification was carried out using these two primers together with HepG2 high molecular weight genomic DNA prepared as described (30Innis M.A. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 13Google Scholar, 31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14Google Scholar). The PCR protocol was as follows: 30 cycles of 95°C for 45 s, 52°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 30 s. A 491-bp DNA fragment resulted, and its sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The fragment was inserted into the XhoI site of the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega), upstream of the luciferase gene. This plasmid is hereafter called pGL2 (apoA-I −491)luc. Plasmid pGL2 (apoA-I −250)luc was constructed by releasing a DNA fragment (−491 to −251 of the apoA-I promoter) from pGL2 (apoA-I −491) using SmaI, and the vector was gel-purified and religated. Plasmid pGL2 (apoA-I −250 mutant DRE)luc was prepared by a PCR-based protocol for extensive mutagenesis of a target DNA sequence as described by Morrison and Desrosiers (32Morrison H.G. Desrosiers R.C. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, we selected seven G and three A residues in the DRE region for mutagenesis, since these residues might participate in the interaction with nuclear proteins as determined by methylation interference. To generate this mutated DRE plasmid, two sets of primers were used. One set of primers, designated GL and Luc, hybridized to specific regions of the plasmid pGL2. The other set of primers, which contained the mutagenic DRE residues, were named primers A and B. The primers GL (5′-TGTATCTTATGGTACTGTAACTG-3′) and B (5′-GACCAGTGAGCAGCAACAGGGCCGGGTATTGCTTCTCCTCCTCCACTACCAGACC-3′) were complementary to the noncoding strand of DNA, while primers Luc (5′-GGCGTCTTCCATTTTACC-3′) and A (5′-CTGGTAGTGGAGGAGGAGAAGCAATACCCGGCCCTGTTGCTGCTCACTG-3′) were complementary to the coding strand of DNA. The plasmid pGL2 (apoA-I −250)luc was used as the PCR template. Amplification was carried out in an Eppendorf MicroCycler E for 30 cycles (consisting of 1 min of denaturing at 94°C, 1 min of annealing at 54°C, and 1 min of extension at 72°C) followed by a final extension for 10 min at 72°C. The first round of PCR using GL + A primer pairs in one tube and B + Luc primer pairs in another tube produced fragments of 241 and 153 bp, respectively. These products were purified from agarose gels using the Sephaglas Band Prep Kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) combined in equimolar amounts and used as templates for the second round of PCR amplification in the presence of GL and Luc primers to generate a 342-bp product, which contained the DRE mutation. The DNA was then digested with KpnI and HindIII, and the resulting DNA fragment was purified from an agarose gel. The purified DNA fragment was cloned into the KpnI and HindIII sites of the pGL2-basic (Promega) and used to transform competent E. coli cells. DNA was prepared from individual clones by the alkaline lysis miniprep procedure, and the entire DNA insert including the area of mutagenesis was sequenced using the Sequenase version 2.0 system (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The vector designated pGL2 TK/luc (kindly provided by Dr. M. Petkovich, Department of Biochemistry, Queen's University) was derived from the pGL2-Basic vector in which the thymidine kinase promoter was inserted upstream of the luciferase gene. Plasmid pGL2 (apoA-I-DRE)TK/luc was constructed by cloning a synthetic oligo-DRE (between nucleotide positions −78 and −43 from the transcriptional start site of the apoA-I gene) into the SmaI site of the pGL2 TK/luc. The vector pGL2 (apoA-I-mutant DRE)TK/luc was constructed by cloning a synthetic mutated oligo-DRE 5′- GGCCGTTTACTTTTTACTAGCCTAAAGATTTAGACC-3′ into the SmaI site of pGL2 TK/luc. The inserts in all of the above plasmids have the same 5′→ 3′ orientation as found in the natural human apoA-I promoter. The human hepatoma cell line, Hep3B, was maintained as monolayers on 100-mm plates in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Transient DNA transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure described by Gorman et al. (33Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total DNA was used per plate, including 4 μg of reporter DNA and 6 μg of carrier pGL2 Basic Vector. After glycerol shock, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with MEM and cultured in MEM + 10% FBS in the absence or presence of gemfibrozil (40 μg/ml) for 24 h with changes of fresh medium. Transfected Hep3B cells were harvested by washing three times in phosphate-buffered saline and assayed for luciferase activity as described (34Mol. Cell. Biol. GeneLight ™ Plasmids Technical Manual. Promega, Madison, WI1991: 1Google Scholar). In all transfections, 5 μg of an internal control plasmid (pSGΔLac Z) containing the Escherichia coli lacZ gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter and enhancer was included in order to correct for differences in transfection and harvesting efficiency. Transfected cells were harvested as described above, and β-galactosidase activities in the cell lysates were determined (34Mol. Cell. Biol. GeneLight ™ Plasmids Technical Manual. Promega, Madison, WI1991: 1Google Scholar). The pGL2 promoter vector (Promega), which contains an SV40 promoter, is used as a reference for both transfection and luciferase assays. Parallel transfection experiments and luciferase assays were also performed using HepG2 cells by the procedures described above. All luciferase activities are reported as mean ± S.E. Significance of group differences was determined by Student's t test, using two-tailed p values. Single-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the upper or lower strands of the DRE from the human apoA-I gene were radiolabeled at their 5′-ends by [γ-32P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were formed by heating the labeled oligonucleotide with an equimolar amount of the corresponding unlabeled complementary strand at 90°C for 5 min. in 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.01 M MgCl2, followed by a slow cooling to room temperature over a period of 2 h. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were partially methylated with dimethyl sulfate as described (35Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The methylation experiment was carried out according to the method of Baldwin and Sharp (35Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The recovered DNA sample was cleaved with 1 M piperidine and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 20% acrylamide DNA sequencing gel. An equivalent amount of radioactivity for each sample was loaded in each lane. The gel was exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70°C. The labeled oligonucleotides were subjected to Maxam and Gilbert sequenci"
