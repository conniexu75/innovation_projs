https://openalex.org/W1979952856,"Autoradiographic evidence after injection of tritiated thymidine indicates that cell position in the laminae of the monkey visual cortex is systematically related to time of cell orgin. The earliest-formed neurons, destined for the deepest stratum, arise at about embryonic day 45, and the last ones, destined for the outermost cell stratum, form at about day 102; cells of intervening layers are generated at intervening times. No neocortical neurons are produced in the last two prenatal months or after birth. Compared to cortical neurons in rodents, those in the monkey arise earlier, and the ""inside-out"" relation of cell position to time of origin is more rigid."

The atmospheric chlorinated hydrocarbons appeared to be gaseous, and the DDT concentration was two orders of magnitude higher than previously reported particulate values. The PCB and DDT were enriched in the surface microlayer (150 micrometers) relative to their concentrations in water at a depth of 30 centimeters. Atmospheric residence times for PCB and DDT of 40 to 50 days, calculated from the concentrations in the air and water, are 20 times shorter than values previously estimated for DDT from rainfall and DDT production data."
https://openalex.org/W2004264089,"Vasopressin and its binding protein, neurophysin, were measured by radioimmunoassay in the hypophyseal portal blood of monkeys after cannulation of individual long portal veins. Mean vasopressin concentrations (13,800 picograms per milliliter) in portal blood were more than 300 times as high as those in the systemic circulation (42 picograms per milliliter). Neurophysin concentration was approximately 25 times as high in portal as in systemic blood. By immunoperoxidase techniques, high concentrations of neurophysin were demonstrated around portal capillaries of the median eminence. These studies indicate direct secretion of vasopressin and neurophysin into the portal circulation; the quantities secreted during stress may be sufficient to exert significant effects on secretion of anterior pituitary hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1966064629,"Antiserum to cerebroside was prepared in rabbits by injection of cerebroside together with bovine serum albumin in complete Freund's adjuvant. When applied to cultures of embryo mouse spinal cord at explantation, this antiserum inhibited sulfatide synthesis and myelination; when applied to myelinated cultures it inhibited sulfatide synthesis and produced demyelination. Complement fixation assays also show antibody to cerebroside in serums from rabbits with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis induced by injection of whole white matter. Absorption of such serum with cerebroside abolishes the inhibiting and demyelinating activities."
https://openalex.org/W1562376901,"Abstract The denaturation and renaturation of bovine carbonic anhydrase B is a thermodynamically reversible process, uncomplicated by aggregation or disulfide bond formation. The reaction is less cooperative than is the unfolding and refolding of most globular proteins, in that distinct successive stages can be observed both in equilibrium and kinetic measurements. This enzyme is therefore ideally suited for investigation of the mechanism of folding of an unfolded polypeptide chain. As part of this work the properties of the native enzyme have been carefully reinvestigated. A somewhat smaller molecular weight (29,000) and sedimentation coefficient (s020,w = 2.89 S) than previously reported were obtained. The absence of cystine or cysteine has been unambiguously established."

https://openalex.org/W165403533,"Bacillus subtilis has three DNA polymerases. Polymerase III is necessary for DNA replication while polymerase I is involved in DNA repair. Four independent mutations leading to loss of polymerase I activity were mapped by transformation between mdh and phoP. Since one of these mutant strains produces a heat-labile polymerase this locus is likely the polymerase I structural gene. Some polymerase III mutants fail to grow at elevated temperatures and have a greatly increased mutation rate. The structural genes for polymerases I and III are unlinked. Purified preparations of the three B. subtilis DNA polymerases have been characterized. Polymerases II and III catalyze a high rate of synthesis in the absence of a full deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate complement, the mechanism of which is probably a truncation of the normal synthetic process. Arabinosylcytosine triphosphate competitively inhibits polymerases II and III as well as DNA synthesis in toluene-treated cells. This analogue is incorporated by these polymerases. Single-stranded DNA is a potent inhibitor of polymerases II and III but not I. The B. subtilis polymerases are readily separable by column chromatography and respond differently to high ionic strength, heat, sulfhydryl reagents, arylazopyrimidines, and various templates. The differences and similarities of the three B. subtilis enzymes relative to the correspondingly numbered Escherichia coli enzymes are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1525825852,"Abstract Removal of a limited number of amino acid residues at the COOH termini of the peptide chains of the glycoprotein hormone, thyrotropin (TSH) shows that the integrity of these regions is important both in subunit-subunit interactions and in vivo biological response. Treatment of the native hormone with a mixture of carboxypeptidases A and B leads to loss of half of the biological activity with the removal of -Lys-Ser-COOH from the α chain and -Tyr-Met-COOH from the β chain. No other alterations to the molecule were detected. Although modification of the hormone does not lead to detectable dissociation, once separated the subunits isolated from the modified hormone do not recombine. The treated β subunit will, however, recombine with native α subunit as judged by gel electrophoresis but no biological activity is recovered. Treatment of isolated subunits leads to further and well defined hydrolysis at their COOH termini with -Tyr-Tyr-Lys-Ser-COOH removed from the α chain and -Lys-Ser-Tyr-Met-COOH removed from the β. Significant recombinations of these materials with each other or native TSH-α and TSH-β did not occur (as expected from the results with the subunits from treated hormone) but both TSH-α and luteinizing hormone (LH)-α after enzymic hydrolysis yielded recombinants, though inactive, with native LH-β. These data indicate significant differences in the regions of the two hormone specific subunits which are in contact with the α subunit. Immunological cross reactivity of all products of enzymatic treatment appears unchanged. Measurement of circular dichroism showed conformational changes resulting from the alterations at the COOH termini only in the case of the α subunit where a strong positive band at 235 to 240 nm decreased markedly after treatment with the carboxypeptidases. Comparisons of the circular dichroism spectra of intact TSH and its subunits and those of luteinizing hormone (LH) were also made. The spectrum of intact TSH was not the sum of the spectra of its corresponding α and β subunits, in agreement with data reported by others for LH, and was very similar to that of bovine LH with the addition of a large maximum at 230 to 240 nm which results from the high tyrosine content of TSH-β versus LH-β."

https://openalex.org/W1608282631,"Abstract The proteins present in the uterine secretions of pigs change both quantitatively and qualitatively during the normal estrous cycle. One of these proteins, which comprises about 15% of the total at Day 15 after estrus, is strongly basic and migrates toward the cathode during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 7.0. It also has a characteristic lavender color with an extinction maximum at 545 nm (e = 1.76 x 103) and gives a positive reaction with periodic acidSchiff stain. In nonpregnant animals this protein is present in the uterus only between Days 12 and 16 after estrus but is absent from serum. It can, however, be induced at approximately the same time in ovariectomized animals given daily doses of progesterone or progesterone plus estrogen. Estrogen alone is ineffective. The protein has been purified from both normal and ovariectomized animals given progesterone by successive chromatography on Sephadex G-100 and CM-cellulose. It was homogeneous as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by immunodiffusion criteria. The protein has a molecular weight of about 32,000 and an isoelectric point at approximately pH 9.7. Large amounts of basic amino acids are present and the molecule is about 12.5% carbohydrate by weight. Antiserum prepared against this protein does not cross-react with extracts from tissues other than the uterus."

The molecular weight of the enzyme is 42,000 as determined by gel filtration. Added divalent cations are not required for activity. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate strongly inhibits activity, but simultaneous addition of an excess of Zn2+ or Co2+ reverses the inhibition. Other inhibitors include potassium phosphate, 2-mercaptoethanol, and ATP. The enzyme has a low level of activity on native DNA. Certain mutant strains which are unable to carry out allelic recombination have reduced amounts of the enzyme. Therefore, this enzyme may play some role in recombination in this organism."

These enzymes are homogeneous as judged by acrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunologically identical with the rat heart citrate synthase. Steady state kinetic studies including product inhibition experiments indicate that the substrates are added in a random order, the products come off in random order, and that two dead end complexes are formed. When acetyl-CoA concentrations are varied over wide range, a nonlinear Lineweaver-Burk plot is obtained suggesting apparent substrate activation. One interpretation of this observation is that some cooperativity exists between two sites on the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W156588775,"In intracellular parasitism the host cell is a true and hospitable host. The parasite does not have to break in the door. It has subtle ways of inducing the host to open the door and welcome it in. One of the exciting fields in the future of parasitology is to find out what these ways are and why they are sometimes so highly specific that the cell that invites one parasite in will not open the door to another closely related species. Once inside, the parasite not only exploits nutrients already available in the cell, and the cell's energy-yielding system, but it further induces the cell to assist actively in its nutrition. Like a bandit who has cajoled his way in, the parasite now forces his host to prepare a banquet for him. Finally it may destroy its host cell, as in most of the associations I have described herein, or it may stimulate its host cell to abnormal increase in size or to have an altered metabolism with the formation of new products. Or it may even contribute some positive benefit to the host cell or to the multicellular organism of which the cell is a part, so that the two kinds of organisms then live together in a state of mutualism or symbiosis."

https://openalex.org/W2396969351,"In contrast to other bird species that have been studied, not one but two distinct lysozymes have been isolated from the egg white of the black swan (Cygnus atratus). One is similar in molecular weight, NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, amino acid composition, specific activity, and immunological cross-reactivity to the lysozymes found in the egg white of the chicken, duck, and many other birds. The other black swan lysozyme shows no resemblance to these “chick-type” enzymes by the above criteria. It is very similar to the lysozyme found until now only in the egg white of the Embden goose. This black swan lysozyme and Embden goose lysozyme have a molecular weight of about 20,500 and are identical in the sequence of their first 20 NH2-terminal amino acids and in immunological cross-reactivity. Amino acid composition data indicate that these two “goose-type” lysozymes differ in sequence by a minimum of four amino acid substitutions. The differences in the structures of the chick-type and goose-type lysozymes suggest that they are products of two distinct genetic loci. Some species contain only chick-type lysozymes in their egg white (e.g. chicken, duck), others only goose-type lysozymes (Embden goose), while others contain both types of enzyme (black swan). In the light of other evidence, this suggests that the genetic loci coding for both enzymes are present in all species and that the presence of either or both lysozymes in egg white is controlled by a species-specific regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1493110577,"Abstract RNA fractions with messenger activity have been isolated from membrane-bound and free polysomes of rabbit liver. These RNAs were translated in a fractionated, messenger-dependent cell-free system derived from rabbit reticulocytes. The general conditions for translation of these liver RNAs were similar to those for reticulocyte messenger RNA. However, with the liver messenger RNA fractions there was a lower per cent release of labeled polypeptides from the ribosome and a greater requirement for ribosomal wash protein to give half-maximal saturation of messenger RNA translation. Evidence for the synthesis of albumin under the direction of liver messenger RNA was obtained by immunoprecipitation, partial chemical purification, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gel isoelectric focusing."

https://openalex.org/W1529092791,"Abstract Tryptic hydrolysis of galactosyltransferase purified from bovine milk by affinity chromatography resulted in a decrease in the amount of the high molecular weight form (58,000) with a concomitant increase in the amount of lower molecular weight form (42,000) with little loss of activity. After extensive activity loss, a peptide of molecular weight 38,000 remained as the predominant species and retained poorly the capacity to bind substrate and α-lactalbumin. Trypsinolysis produced at least one small peptide fragment which migrated with the tracking dye on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Chymotryptic hydrolysis led to a loss in enzymic activity and gave rise to at least five peptides ranging from 10,000 to 32,000 in molecular weight. As with trypsin treatment, only the larger fragments (molecular weight g 25,000) contained carbohydrate."
https://openalex.org/W1634681097,"Abstract l-Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, a hemoprotein, purified to near homogeneity from cells of Pseudomonas fluorescens, has been shown to contain only trace amounts of copper. During the purification procedure, the heme content of the enzyme preparation increased in parallel with the specific catalytic activity, whereas that of copper decreased. The level of copper present in the highly purified enzyme preparations was about one-tenth that of the heme, indicating that the copper found was adventitious. The inhibitory effect of copper-chelating agents such as sodium diethyldithiocarbamate and bathocuproine sulfonate on the enzyme activity was not due to their specific chelating action but was attributable to their unforeseen properties as a hydrogen peroxidetrapping reagent and a nonspecific inhibitor, respectively. The results are thus incompatible with the view that l-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase is a copper-hemoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W1523545737,"α-Lytic protease is a homologue of the mammalian serine proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase, and its single histidine residue belongs to the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad. This single histidine residue has been selectively enriched in the C-2 carbon with 13C. Magnetic resonance studies of the chemical shift and coupling constant (1Jch) behavior of this nucleus as a function of pH suggest that the imidazole ring is neutral above pH 5 and therefore that the group which is known to ionize with pKa near 6.7 must be the aspartic acid residue. 

Implications of these new pKa assignments for the catalytic mechanism of serine proteases are discussed and include the absence of any need to separate charge during catalysis. The histidine residue plays two roles. (a) It insulates the aspartic acid from an aqueous environment and accordingly raises its pKa. (b) It serves as a bidentate base to accept a proton from the serine at one of its nitrogens and concertedly transfer a proton from its other nitrogen to the buried carboxylate anion during formation of the tetrahedral intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W24348274,"Abstract A new DNA polymerase has been purified 1000-fold from Bacillus subtilis infected with bacteriophage SP01.

The enzyme requires deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates, Mg2+, β-mercaptoethanol, and single stranded DNA templates for activity. Bihelical DNA which has been partially denatured serves as the preferred template in in vitro reactions. Although 5-hydroxymethyluracil replaces thymine in SP01 DNA, deoxynucleotide analogues of 5-hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate can serve as efficient substrates for the phage polymerase. The purified enzyme is free of endonuclease activity."
https://openalex.org/W1553447712,"Abstract A reversible association of magnesium with beef heart submitochondrial particles was monitored with the use of the fluorescent chelate probe, chlorotetracycline, and direct measurement of the magnesium content of the membranes under various conditions. Addition of an oxidizable substrate, such as succinate, or ATP to the submitochondrial particles caused an energization of the membranes and the release of up to 50% of the magnesium from the particles. The release of magnesium was prevented by the addition of uncoupler, antimycin A, or malonate, each of which prevented the establishment of the energized state of the mitochondrial membranes. Following the energized release of magnesium from the particles, the addition of compounds leading to deenergization caused a rapid, nearly complete reassociation of magnesium with the membranes. Although energization of the submitochondrial particles was not dependent upon either a high level of membrane-associated magnesium or the actual release of magnesium from the membrane, the rapid release of magnesium was dependent upon the establishment of the high energy state. It was also apparent that the magnesium content of the membranes determined the amount of chlorotetracycline which was bound to the membrane, i.e. the greater the magnesium content, the greater the amount of chelate probe which was bound to the particles. The membrane-associated magnesium which was capable of being released from the particles upon energization was not accessible to polar chelators such as ethylenediaminetetraacetate, but was accessible to the lipophilic chelator, o-phenanthroline. These studies suggest that the ratio of bound to free magnesium within the mitochondrion may be regulated by an energy-dependent, reversible association of magnesium with the mitochondrial membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1498776581,"Abstract The UDP-galactose:lipopolysaccharide galactosyltransferase reaction has been studied using an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph of Escherichia coli. The unsaturated fatty acid residues of the E. coli membrane phospholipid have been varied with respect to chain length, position, number, and configuration (cis versus trans) of the ethylenic bond. Although the galactose content of the lipopolysaccharide from cells with membrane phospholipid altered in this way is not appreciably reduced, the reaction itself is found to be sensitive to changes in the fatty acid structure of the phospholipid. The reaction was measured in EDTA-treated intact cells, or using supernatant enzyme and cell envelopes, or membranes, as a source of galactose-deficient acceptor. In general, the activity was greater under conditions known to restrict the packing of the fatty acid residues of phospholipid; for example, shorter chain length, an ethylenic bond near the carboxyl terminus, and cis- rather than trans-unsaturated fatty acids. The activity was also reduced to a much greater extent at lower assay temperatures (l37°) using preparations containing trans-unsaturated fatty acid than with preparations containing the corresponding cis-unsaturated fatty acid. Arrhenius plots of the activity using cell envelopes show a discontinuity when the unsaturated fatty acid is cis-Δ9-16:1, cis-Δ9-18:1, or cis-Δ11-18:1, but not when the corresponding trans-unsaturated fatty acid is used. The temperature at which the discontinuity occurs is 18–23° for all three cis-unsaturated fatty acids."

Peptide maps of the two monkey prealbumins differ definitely from each other in only one peptide. The NH2-terminal sequences (1 to 21) suggest that each variant of Rhesus prealbumin is composed of identical subunits; an interchange of valine and isoleucine is found at residue 5 in Rhesus prealbumin. The structural features of both Rhesus prealbumins are very similar to those of human prealbumin."
https://openalex.org/W1482304804,"Abstract The compartmentalization of acetyl-CoA metabolism in Tetrahymena has been studied by measuring the incorporation of label from [1-14C]acetate, [2-14C]pyruvate, and [1-14C]-octanoate into CO2, lipids, glycogen, and glutamate in experiments in which these substrates were used singly, in pairs, and all together. The results of these studies require that there be at least three pools of acetyl-CoA in Tetrahymena, two in the mitochondria and one in the peroxisomes. A steady state model was developed which allows a quantitative analysis of the metabolic fate of acetyl-CoA derived from acetate, pyruvate, and octanoate. The model shows that pyruvate enters a different mitochondrial pool of acetyl-CoA than acetate or octanoate, which accounts for the relatively high proportion of [2-14C]pyruvate label incorporated into glycogen. About three-fourths of the acetate utilization occurs in the mitochondria, the remainder via the peroxisomal pool of acetyl-CoA for lipogenesis. Only part of the octanoate utilization is accounted for by β oxidation in the peroxisomes; a pathway is also required allowing the incorporation of label from octanoate into lipids without prior oxidation to acetyl-CoA. Labeled acetyl-CoA used for glyconeogenesis comes from both the peroxisomal and the outer mitochondrial pools of acetyl-CoA, more of it coming from the former. The experiments were performed on well aerated cultures in both the logarithmic and transitional phases of growth. Differences in metabolic flux patterns between cells at these two stages of growth are small; lipogenesis was decreased and glutamate output and pyruvate utilization were increased in transition as compared to log cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1520883383,"Abstract The neutral glycosphingolipids and gangliosides of cell membrane particulate fractions from normal canine kidney and allograft rejected canine kidney have been examined. Those which increased in concentration in the rejected kidney were glucosylceramide, galactosylglucosylceramide, galactosylgalactosylglucosylceramide, N-acetylgalactosaminylgalactosylgalactosylglucosylceramide, N-acetylgalactosaminyl-N-acetylgalactosaminylgalactosylgalactosylglucosylceramide (Forssman hapten), and N-acetylneuraminylgalactosylglucosylceramide. Glycosphingolipids which were lower in the rejected kidney were galactosylceramide, digalactosylceramide, and galactosylsulfatide. The composition of the oligosaccharide moiety of each glycosphingolipid was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The positions of glycosidic linkages of the sugars were determined by permethylation and gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of the partially methylated alditol acetates. The internal linkages of the oligosaccharides determined were N-acetylgalactosaminyl(1 →3)N-acetylgalactosaminyl(1 →3)galactosyl(1 →4)galactosyl(1 →4)glucosylceramide, galactosyl(1 →4)galactosyl(1 →4)glucosylceramide, and N-acetylneuraminyl(2 →3)-galactosyl(1 →4)glucosylceramide. The glycosphingolipids of canine kidney membrane were found by complement fixation to have little or no antibody binding capacity when tested against serum obtained from transplant recipients after removal of the rejected kidney allograft. Intravenous injection of d-[1-14C]glucosamine into a kidney transplant recipient 4 days after transplantation demonstrated a rapid incorporation into the hexosamine-containing glycosphingolipids of the rejected kidney membrane but not normal kidney membrane. Low levels of radioactivity were incorporated into the gangliosides of both control and rejecting kidneys and into the other neutral glycosphingolipids of control kidneys."

https://openalex.org/W1516616835,"Abstract Tetrahymena were grown with shaking for 17 hours in the presence and absence of AMP. Under these conditions, glycogen content increased but there was a marked inhibition of glyoxylate oxidation and of the incorporation of label from acetate into glycogen during a 1-hour incubation. AMP treatment also caused and increase in the rate of incorporation of [3H]uracil into RNA which was maximal about 2 hours after the start of growth. Experiments were performed in which cells from log and transition phase cultures were incubated with acetate, pyruvate, and octanoate, but with only one substrate labeled in any one flask. Measurements were made of the amount of label incorporated from each labeled substrate into glycogen, lipids, CO2, and glutamate, and the results were analyzed according to a previously established model for the structure of metabolism in Tetrahymena. It was found that the model, which utilizes three pools of acetyl-CoA, permitted a quantitative fit to the data. Analysis of the data showed that AMP treatment reduced the rate of the Krebs cycle, the rate of glyconeogenesis, and the rate of pyruvate utilization in both log and transition phase cells from these labeled substrates. Incorporation of label from acetate into glutamate, however, was increased by AMP treatment in log cells and decreased in transition phase cells. AMP treatment markedly decreased the fraction of label entering into glyconeogenesis from the peroxisomal pool of acetyl-CoA. There was no change in the ATP:ADP ratio in log cells treated with AMP, and a slight decrease in the sum ATP + ADP. In transition phase cells, however, the ATP:-ADP ratio decreased and the sum of ATP + ADP also increased compared to control cells. Since many of the changes in intracellular flux patterns occurred in both log and transitional cells, changes in enzyme levels or control mechanisms other than the ATP:ADP ratios must be invoked to explain the effects of AMP on metabolism."

However, treatment with this large dose of EHDP enhanced the hypophosphatemic effect of a low dose of parathyroid hormone (10 international units per 100 grams of body weight), apparently by promoting the renal excretion of phosphate.

https://openalex.org/W1581307277,"Abstract Experiments were done in which control cells and cells exposed to tolbutamide for 17 hours were incubated for 1 hour with labeled pyruvate, acetate, and octanoate, and the amount of label appearing in CO2, glycogen, lipids, and glutamate was measured. In separate experiments ATP and ADP levels were also measured in control and tolbutamide-treated cells. The results of the multiple label experiments were interpreted in accordance with a previously developed model of the metabolism of Tetrahymena which has three pools of acetyl-CoA. It was found that in log phase cells there were significant increases in octanoate oxidation in the peroxisomal and inner mitochondrial pools of acetyl-CoA, and a shift of acetate utilization away from the peroxisome and into the inner mitochondrial compartment. Incorporation of label from [1-14C]acetate into glutamate was reduced by tolbutamide. Carbon flow from the peroxisomes for glyconeogenesis was markedly reduced, but carbon flow for glyconeogenesis from the outer mitochondrial pool was increased. In transition phase cells, however, carbon flow toward glyconeogenesis was reduced from both the peroxisomes and the mitochondria. The cell content of ATP was increased by exposure of the cells to tolbutamide; the increase was more pronounced in log phase cells. It is suggested that tolbutamide does not uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in Tetrahymena but instead alters the intracellular pattern of carbon flow because of an effect on the rate of flow of substrates across the inner mitochondrial membrane."

NADPH + DHF + H+ ⇄ NADP+ + THF ΔH1 = -12.6 ± 0.3 Cal/mole (1) CH2(OH) + THF ⇄ methylene-THF (CH2 - THF) + 2H2O ΔH2 = -25.0 ± 5 Cal/mole (2) CH2 - THF + dUMP ⇄ DHF + dTMP ΔH3 = -9.5 ± 1.3 Cal/mole (3) Reaction 2 occurs without enzyme and is accompanied by a large decrease in entropy. The observed enthalpy values in combination with the appropriate equilibrium constants from the literature indicate that the experimentally observed irreversibility of Reaction 3 is due in part to a large positive entropy change. The sum of Reactions 1, 2, and 3 gives the over-all Reaction 4 in which the reduced folates act catalytically. NADPH + H+ + CH2(OH)2 + dUMP ⇄ NADP+ + dTMP + 2H2O ΔH4 = -47.1 Cal/mole (4) This large exothermic ΔH clearly makes a significant contribution to driving the over-all reaction toward thymidylate formation. In order to assist in our understanding of the driving forces acting on Reactions 1 to 4, a series of ancillary measurements were made. These are: CH2(OH)SCH2CH2OH + THF ⇄ CH2 - THF + HOCH2CH2SH + H2O ΔH5 = -15.4 Cal/mole (5) and CH2(OH)2 + HOCH2CH2SH ⇄ CH2(OH)SCH2CH2OH ΔH6 = -9.6 Cal/mole (6) These various enthalpy values were combined with free energy values from the literature in a manner which allowed an estimate of the minimum equilibrium constant for Reaction 3 to be obtained. This value, K ≃ 1025, presents a thermodynamic explanation for the failure to demonstrate reversibility for this system. Consideration of the sign of the entropy change accompanying Reaction 3 indicates that the equilibrium constant may be several orders of magnitude greater than this minimum value."

https://openalex.org/W3146712765,"MOLTON et al.1 have reported that bacteria in liquid cultures survived exposure to normally lethal temperatures when heated in a high pressure CO2 atmosphere. Because these results could influence planetary quarantine constraints, particularly for the planet Venus, and because no protection against thermal death by CO2 has been reported previously, an attempt was made to verify their results."
