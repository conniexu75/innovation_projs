https://openalex.org/W1834839393,"Here we present new technology for optical coherence tomography (OCT) that enables ultrahigh-resolution, non-invasive in vivo ophthalmologic imaging of retinal and corneal morphology with an axial resolution of 2–3 μm. This resolution represents a significant advance in performance over the 10–15-μm resolution currently available in ophthalmic OCT systems and, to our knowledge, is the highest resolution for in vivo ophthalmologic imaging achieved to date. This resolution enables in vivo visualization of intraretinal and intra-corneal architectural morphology that had previously only been possible with histopathology. We demonstrate image processing and segmentation techniques for automatic identification and quantification of retinal morphology. Ultrahigh-resolution OCT promises to enhance early diagnosis and objective measurement for tracking progression of ocular diseases, as well as monitoring the efficacy of therapy.

Current clinical practice emphasizes the development of techniques to diagnose disease in its early stages, when treatment is most effective and irreversible damage can be prevented or delayed. In ophthalmology, the precise visualization of pathology is especially critical for the diagnosis and staging of ocular diseases. Therefore, new imaging techniques have been developed to augment conventional fundoscopy and slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Ultrasonography is routinely used in ophthalmology, but requires physical contact with the eye and has axial resolutions of approximately 200 μm (ref. 1). High-frequency ultrasound enables approximately 20 μm axial resolutions, but due to limited penetration, only anterior eye structures can be imaged2. Confocal microscopy has been used to image the cornea with sub-micrometer transverse resolution3. Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy enables en face fundus imaging with micron-scale transverse and approximately 300-μm axial resolution4,5. None of these techniques, however, permits high-resolution, cross-sectional imaging of the retina in vivo.

Recently, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has emerged as a promising new technique for high-resolution, cross-sectional imaging6,7. OCT is attractive for ophthalmic imaging because image resolutions are 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than conventional ultrasound, imaging can be performed non-invasively and in real time, and quantitative morphometric information can be obtained. OCT is somewhat analogous to ultrasound imaging except that it uses light instead of sound. High-resolution, cross-sectional images are obtained by measuring the echo time delay of reflected infrared light using a technique known as low coherence interferometry8,9. OCT imaging was first demonstrated in the human retina in vitro6 and in vivo10,11. Recently, it has been extended to a wide range of other non-transparent tissues to function as a type of optical biopsy12–15. To date, however, the most important clinical applications of OCT have been retinal imaging in ophthalmic diagnosis7,16–22. Current ophthalmic OCT systems have 10–15-μm axial resolution and provide more detailed structural information than any other non-invasive ophthalmic imaging technique6,7,10,11. However, the resolution of current clinical ophthalmic OCT technology is significantly below what is theoretically possible. Improving the resolution of OCT ophthalmic imaging would enable structural imaging of retinal pathology at an intraretinal level, as well as improve the accuracy of morphometric quantification.

The axial resolution of conventional ophthalmic OCT systems is limited to 10–15 μm by the bandwidth of light sources used for imaging. Short-pulse, solid-state lasers can generate ultrabroad bandwidth, low-coherence light13. A broadband Cr:Forsterite laser operating in the near infrared (1,300 nm) has permitted cellular-level OCT imaging in developmental biology specimens with 6-μm axial resolution13. For ophthalmic imaging, light sources operating at 800 nm are necessary to avoid absorption in the ocular media. Recently, a state-of-the-art broadband Ti:Al2O3 laser has been developed for ultrahigh (~1 μm) axial resolution, spectroscopic OCT imaging in non-transparent tissue at 800-nm center wavelength23,24. We describe here ultrahigh-resolution ophthalmic OCT based on this state-of-the-art optical technology and demonstrate its potential to provide enhanced structural and quantitative information for ophthalmologic imaging."

We have determined the crystal structures at 2.5 Å-resolution of HSA-myristate complexed with the R-(+) and S-(−) enantiomers of warfarin, a widely used anticoagulant that binds to the protein with high affinity. The structures confirm that warfarin binds to drug site I (in subdomain IIA) in the presence of fatty acids and reveal the molecular details of the protein-drug interaction. The two enantiomers of warfarin adopt very similar conformations when bound to the protein and make many of the same specific contacts with amino acid side chains at the binding site, thus accounting for the relative lack of stereospecificity of the HSA-warfarin interaction. The conformation of the warfarin binding pocket is significantly altered upon binding of fatty acids, and this can explain the observed enhancement of warfarin binding to HSA at low levels of fatty acid.1h9z1ha2 Human serum albumin (HSA) is an abundant transport protein found in plasma that binds a wide variety of drugs in two primary binding sites (I and II) and can have a significant impact on their pharmacokinetics.

The protein binds a number of relatively insoluble endogenous compounds such as unesterified fatty acids, bilirubin, and bile acids and thus facilitates their transport throughout the circulation (1Peters T. All about Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1995Google Scholar, 2Kragh-Hansen U. Dan. Med. Bull. 1990; 37: 57-84PubMed Google Scholar). HSA is also capable of binding a wide variety of drugs (1Peters T. All about Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1995Google Scholar, 2Kragh-Hansen U. Dan. Med. Bull. 1990; 37: 57-84PubMed Google Scholar, 3Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 152-203Google Scholar), and much of the interest in this abundant protein derives from its effects on drug delivery. Drug binding to plasma proteins such as HSA can be an important determinant of pharmacokinetics, restricting the unbound concentration and affecting distribution and elimination. In some cases the major fraction of the administered drug is sequestered by HSA; this is particularly true of warfarin, a widely used anticoagulant, which is 99% bound to the protein under normal therapeutic conditions and consequently has a small volume of distribution and low clearance (4Holford N.H.G. Benet L.Z. Katzung B.G. Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, 7th Ed. Appleton and Lange, Stamford, CT1998: 34-49Google Scholar).HSA has a limited number of binding sites for endogenous and exogenous ligands, so that drug binding to the protein may be affected by a variety of factors. Although the effects on pharmacokinetics of drug-drug competition for the same sites on HSA are generally held to be of little clinical import (4Holford N.H.G. Benet L.Z. Katzung B.G. Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, 7th Ed. Appleton and Lange, Stamford, CT1998: 34-49Google Scholar, 5Lindup W.E. Bridges J.W. Chasseaud L.F. Gibson G.G. Progress in Drug Metabolism. 10. Taylor & Francis, London1987: 141-185Google Scholar), physiological or diseased states that cause variations in the plasma levels of albumin or its primary endogenous ligands can influence drug binding and may require dosages to be closely monitored. Added to this, genetic polymorphisms in HSA can also alter drug binding and may further complicate the clinical picture (6Petersen C.E. Ha C.E. Harohalli K. Park D.S. Bhagavan N.V. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 124: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Wilding G. Blumberg E.S. Vesell E.S. Science. 1977; 195: 991-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis of these effects, structural information is required to fully delineate the binding sites for drugs and endogenous ligands. Such information will also be invaluable to efforts to exploit the carrier properties of HSA in the development of novel therapeutic reagents for drug targeting (8Beljaars L. Molema G. Schuppan D.

Komatsu T. Hamamatsu K. Matsukawa Y. Tajima A. Yoshizu A. Izumi Y. Kobayashi K. Bioconjugate Chem. 2000; 11: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).HSA, a 585-residue protein, is monomeric but contains three structurally similar α-helical domains (I–III); each domain can be divided into subdomains A and B, which contain six and four α-helices, respectively (3Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 152-203Google Scholar, 10He X.M. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar). Structural studies have mapped the locations of the fatty acid binding sites (11Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 12Bhattacharya A.A. Grüne T. Curry S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) and the primary drug binding sites on the protein (10He X.M. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar). The fatty acid binding sites are distributed throughout the protein and involve all six subdomains; by contrast many drugs bind to one of the two primary binding sites on the protein, known as Sudlow's sites I and II (13Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1975; 11: 824-832PubMed Google Scholar). Although examples of drugs binding elsewhere on the protein have been documented (13Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1975; 11: 824-832PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sjoholm I. Ekman B. Kober A. Ljungstedt-Pahlman I. Seiving B. Sjodin T. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), most work has focused on the primary drug sites. These investigations have largely employed competition binding methods to investigate the selectivity of the primary drug binding sites. Drug site I, where warfarin binds, has been characterized as a conformationally adaptable region with up to three subcompartments (16Fehske K.J. Schläfer U. Wollert U. Müller W.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 21: 387-393Google Scholar, 17Kragh-Hansen U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 160-171PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yamasaki K. Maruyama T. Kragh-Hansen U. Otagiri M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1295: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).Crystallographic studies located drug sites I and II in subdomains IIA and IIIA, respectively, and provided the first detailed description of the geometry and chemistry of the binding environment (10He X.M. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar). Several reports have analyzed structural aspects of the binding of an aspirin analogue, 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIB), to defatted HSA (10He X.M. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar), to the HSA-myristate complex (11Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar), or to equine serum albumin (19Ho J.X. Holowachuk E.W. Norton E.J. Twigg P.D. Carter D.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, these studies were done at fairly modest resolutions (3.0–4.0 Å), and in any case it is not clear whether TIB, which carries three iodine atoms, is properly representative of typical HSA drug ligands.The binding of warfarin to HSA and the interactions of the drug with other HSA ligands have been investigated for many years. Warfarin (3-(α-acetonylbenzyl)-4-hydroxycoumarin) binds to drug site I with high affinity (Kd ≈ 3 μm) (13Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1975; 11: 824-832PubMed Google Scholar, 20Diana F.J. Veronich K. Kapoor A.L. J. Pharm. Sci. 1989; 78: 195-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,21Loun B. Hage D.S. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3814-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A crystallographic study in 1992 confirmed subdomain IIA as the binding locus for a single molecule of warfarin but was unable to give specific details on the binding interactions because of the limited resolution of the data (10He X.M. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar). Warfarin shares this binding site with a range of other drugs (including phenylbutazone, tolbutamide, and indomethacin) and thus competes with them for binding to HSA (13Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1975; 11: 824-832PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fehske K.J. Schläfer U. Wollert U. Müller W.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 21: 387-393Google Scholar,17Kragh-Hansen U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 160-171PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that low levels of fatty acids (22Vorum H. Honoré B. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1996; 48: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Birkett D.J. Myers S.P. Sudlow G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1977; 13: 987-992PubMed Google Scholar) or elevated pH (24Wilting J. van der Giesen W.F. Janssen L.H. Weideman M.M. Otagiri M. Perrin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3032-3037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wanwimolruk S. Birkett D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 709: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) may enhance the affinity of HSA for warfarin by up to 3-fold, but the molecular mechanisms of these effects are not well understood. To elucidate the molecular details of the interaction of warfarin with HSA, we report here the determination of the crystal structures of HSA-myristate complexed with both theR-(+) and S-(−) enantiomers of the drug.DISCUSSIONDrug binding to HSA has been extensively investigated over the past 30 years. Much of this work has been performed using binding and competition assays to map out the number and selectivity of binding sites on the protein (13Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1975; 11: 824-832PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fehske K.J. Schläfer U. Wollert U. Müller W.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 21: 387-393Google Scholar, 17Kragh-Hansen U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 160-171PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yamasaki K. Maruyama T. Kragh-Hansen U. Otagiri M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1295: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 34Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1976; 12: 1052-1061PubMed Google Scholar), although more recently, mutagenesis techniques have been applied to the study of drug interactions (6Petersen C.E. Ha C.E. Harohalli K. Park D.S. Bhagavan N.V. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 124: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35Dockal M. Chang M. Carter D.C. Ruker F. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although initial crystallographic studies at moderate resolution have focused mainly on the binding of TIB, a drug analogue, to HSA (10He X.M. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar, 11Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar), there has been a lack of high resolution structural information with which to interpret the amassed biochemical and biophysical data on HSA-drug interactions.The structures reported in this paper provide the first high resolution view of what might reasonably be termed a “classic” site I drug bound to HSA. Although many different drugs bind to site I, they are generally bulky heterocyclic compounds with a negative charge located toward the center of the molecule (34Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1976; 12: 1052-1061PubMed Google Scholar). Warfarin exemplifies this type of compound, and the structure of the HSA-myristate-warfarin complex shows how this broad selectivity is achieved. The coumarin and benzyl moieties are accommodated in separate but adjacent chambers of what has previously been described as a “sock-shaped” pocket (10He X.M. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar). The polar features of the drug are all found at the basic mouth of the pocket, with the exception of the hydroxyl oxygen (O4), which interacts specifically with the side chain of His-242 on one wall of the pocket (Fig. 3 C).Both enantiomers of warfarin bind in essentially the same way to the protein. This accounts for the poor stereoselectivity of albumin and suggests that the prospects for developing it as a reagent for chiral separations of warfarin are unfavorable. Conversely, the structure clearly reveals the details of the HSA-warfarin interaction and provides a structural basis for the possible design of warfarin derivatives with altered HSA binding properties. The binding of several warfarin derivatives to HSA has already been characterized; acenocoumarin binds more loosely than warfarin, and phenprocoumon binds more tightly (16Fehske K.J. Schläfer U. Wollert U. Müller W.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 21: 387-393Google Scholar, 22Vorum H. Honoré B. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1996; 48: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 34Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1976; 12: 1052-1061PubMed Google Scholar). The weaker association of acenocoumarin probably occurs because the addition of an NO2 group to the benzyl ring sterically hinders its accommodation in the hydrophobic compartment formed primarily by Phe-211, Trp-214, Leu-219, and Leu-238. By contrast the tighter binding of phenprocoumon, in which the CH2-CO-CH3 acetonyl group found on warfarin is replaced by a propyl moiety (C3H7), may be due to the formation of hydrophobic contacts between this propyl group and the side chains of Trp-214 and Arg-218 (Fig. 3 C).Comparison with the structure of HSA-myristate-TIB (11Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar) reveals differences in the ways that TIB and warfarin bind to site I. The heterocyclic coumarin moiety of warfarin binds in the same location as the benzyl ring of TIB. Although the planes of the aromatic rings are inclined at about 20° to each other, they make many of the same interactions with the walls of this part of the pocket, and both drugs can also from specific hydrogen bonds with His-242. The presence of bulky iodine atoms projecting from the TIB benzyl group make it too wide to fit into the sub-pocket that accommodates the benzyl ring of warfarin.Effect of Fatty Acids on Warfarin BindingOur structural results offer a plausible explanation for the observation that binding of fatty acids to HSA can enhance the affinity of the protein for warfarin and some other site I ligands (22Vorum H. Honoré B. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1996; 48: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Birkett D.J. Myers S.P. Sudlow G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1977; 13: 987-992PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1976; 12: 1052-1061PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of up to 3 mol of long chain fatty acids per mol of HSA can increase the affinity for warfarin by almost a factor of three (22Vorum H. Honoré B. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1996; 48: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Birkett D.J. Myers S.P. Sudlow G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1977; 13: 987-992PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acid binding to HSA induces a substantial conformational change in the protein involving rotations of domains I and III relative to domain II (11Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 12Bhattacharya A.A. Grüne T. Curry S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 36Curry S. Brick P. Franks N.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). One of the principal driving forces behind this conformational change is binding of a fatty acid molecule to the binding site (FA2) that spans the interface between subdomains IA and IIA and lies close to the warfarin binding site. In the absence of fatty acid the side chain of Tyr-150 from the linker connecting helices h2 and h3 of subdomain IB projects into the warfarin binding site (Fig.3 D). However, occupation of site FA2 by myristate displaces domain IB, rotating helices h2 and h3 and pulling the side chain of Tyr-150 out of the drug pocket to allow it to hydrogen-bond with the carboxylate group of the fatty acid (FA2). In concert with the movement of Tyr-150 the side chain of Arg-257 rotates to hydrogen-bond to the same fatty acid carboxylate. The changes induced by fatty acid binding, removal of a hydroxyl group from the drug pocket and repositioning of the aliphatic portion of Arg-257, thus render the binding environment for the coumarin moiety more hydrophobic. This appears to be the most likely explanation for the increased binding affinity of HSA for warfarin. Curiously, the binding of phenprocoumon is only marginally (∼20%) enhanced under similar conditions (22Vorum H. Honoré B. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1996; 48: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This suggests that minor conformational changes induced by fatty acid binding in the vicinity of the mouth of the pocket may also affect drug binding.The enhancement of warfarin binding by fatty acids is maximal with 3–4 mol of fatty acid bound per mol of HSA (22Vorum H. Honoré B. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1996; 48: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Birkett D.J. Myers S.P. Sudlow G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1977; 13: 987-992PubMed Google Scholar). At higher fatty acid concentrations the affinity for warfarin falls off, an observation that is probably attributable to direct competition between the drug and fatty acid for binding to the pocket in IIA. This interpretation is supported by the observation that fatty acid binds to this site (designated FA7) in a manner that is suggestive of a low affinity interaction (primarily because of the absence of specific interactions between the protein and the fatty acid carboxylate group) (12Bhattacharya A.A. Grüne T. Curry S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Thus we would only expect to find displacement of the drug by high levels of fatty acid.Effect of pH on Warfarin BindingOver the pH range 6–9 HSA undergoes a transition from the neutral to the basic form that is linked to an increase in the affinity of the protein for a number of site I ligands, including warfarin (which binds about 3-fold more tightly at alkaline pH) (24Wilting J. van der Giesen W.F. Janssen L.H. Weideman M.M. Otagiri M. Perrin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3032-3037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise nature of the structural changes associated with the neutral-basic transition is incompletely characterized. The transition appears largely to involve changes in domains I and II, although there is some involvement of domain III (32Bos O.J. Remijn J.P. Fischer M.J. Wilting J. Janssen L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3905-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether there is any link between the structural changes induced by shifts in pH and those induced by fatty acid binding, although the observation that fatty acid binding lowers the pH of the midpoint of the neutral-basic transition suggests a possible parallel between the two effects (25Wanwimolruk S. Birkett D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 709: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In view of the paucity of data on this point, attempts to explain the pH effect on warfarin binding to HSA from the crystal structure are problematic. Our results show that the only group in the binding site that is likely to be titratable in the range pH 6–9 is the side chain of His-242, which makes a hydrogen bond to the drug. However, raising the pH would deprotonate the histidine, which would be expected to reduce the strength of its interaction with warfarin, contrary to the results of binding experiments. It thus appears that other effects of pH upon the protein are responsible for tighter binding at alkaline pH, and further work will be required to determine what these are.ConclusionsRecently, methods to study structural aspects of drug binding using engineered fragments of HSA have been developed in an effort to make the analysis more tractable (35Dockal M. Chang M. Carter D.C. Ruker F. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 37Mao H. Gunasekera A.H. Fesik S.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although such approaches are likely to be very valuable, particularly because they use fragments small enough to be analyzed structurally by nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, truncations of the protein may give rise to inadvertent structural perturbations of the drug binding sites. This study and an earlier structural analysis of HSA complexed with the general anesthetics propofol and halothane (15Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) demonstrate the feasibility of high resolution crystallographic studies of the binding of drugs to the intact protein and show that the structural information obtained provides a richly detailed view of the binding site with which to interpret the biochemical and biophysical data already accumulated on drug interactions with the protein. Further work on other site I and site II drugs will allow us to build up a much more complete picture of drug interactions with HSA and will provide a structural basis for a more rational approach to drug design either to exploit or avoid the impact of HSA on drug delivery. Human serum albumin (HSA)1 is the major protein component of blood plasma but is also distributed to the interstitial fluid of the body tissues. The protein binds a number of relatively insoluble endogenous compounds such as unesterified fatty acids, bilirubin, and bile acids and thus facilitates their transport throughout the circulation (1Peters T.

HSA is also capable of binding a wide variety of drugs (1Peters T. All about Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1995Google Scholar, 2Kragh-Hansen U. Dan. Med. Bull. 1990; 37: 57-84PubMed Google Scholar, 3Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 152-203Google Scholar), and much of the interest in this abundant protein derives from its effects on drug delivery. Drug binding to plasma proteins such as HSA can be an important determinant of pharmacokinetics, restricting the unbound concentration and affecting distribution and elimination. In some cases the major fraction of the administered drug is sequestered by HSA; this is particularly true of warfarin, a widely used anticoagulant, which is 99% bound to the protein under normal therapeutic conditions and consequently has a small volume of distribution and low clearance (4Holford N.H.G. Benet L.Z. Katzung B.G. Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, 7th Ed. Appleton and Lange, Stamford, CT1998: 34-49Google Scholar). HSA has a limited number of binding sites for endogenous and exogenous ligands, so that drug binding to the protein may be affected by a variety of factors. Although the effects on pharmacokinetics of drug-drug competition for the same sites on HSA are generally held to be of little clinical import (4Holford N.H.G. Benet L.Z. Katzung B.G. Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, 7th Ed. Appleton and Lange, Stamford, CT1998: 34-49Google Scholar, 5Lindup W.E. Bridges J.W. Chasseaud L.F. Gibson G.G. Progress in Drug Metabolism. 10. Taylor & Francis, London1987: 141-185Google Scholar), physiological or diseased states that cause variations in the plasma levels of albumin or its primary endogenous ligands can influence drug binding and may require dosages to be closely monitored. Added to this, genetic polymorphisms in HSA can also alter drug binding and may further complicate the clinical picture (6Petersen C.E. Ha C.E. Harohalli K. Park D.S. Bhagavan N.V. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 124: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Wilding G. Blumberg E.S. Vesell E.S. Science. 1977; 195: 991-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis of these effects, structural information is required to fully delineate the binding sites for drugs and endogenous ligands. Such information will also be invaluable to efforts to exploit the carrier properties of HSA in the development of novel therapeutic reagents for drug targeting (8Beljaars L. Molema G. Schuppan D.

Komatsu T. Hamamatsu K. Matsukawa Y. Tajima A. Yoshizu A. Izumi Y. Kobayashi K. Bioconjugate Chem. 2000; 11: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). HSA, a 585-residue protein, is monomeric but contains three structurally similar α-helical domains (I–III); each domain can be divided into subdomains A and B, which contain six and four α-helices, respectively (3Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 152-203Google Scholar, 10He X.M. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar). Structural studies have mapped the locations of the fatty acid binding sites (11Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 12Bhattacharya A.A. Grüne T. Curry S. J. Mol.

Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar). The fatty acid binding sites are distributed throughout the protein and involve all six subdomains; by contrast many drugs bind to one of the two primary binding sites on the protein, known as Sudlow's sites I and II (13Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1975; 11: 824-832PubMed Google Scholar). Although examples of drugs binding elsewhere on the protein have been documented (13Sudlow G. Birkett D.J. Wade D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1975; 11: 824-832PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sjoholm I. Ekman B. Kober A. Ljungstedt-Pahlman I. Seiving B. Sjodin T. Mol.

These investigations have largely employed competition binding methods to investigate the selectivity of the primary drug binding sites. Drug site I, where warfarin binds, has been characterized as a conformationally adaptable region with up to three subcompartments (16Fehske K.J. Schläfer U. Wollert U. Müller W.E. Mol.

Acta. 1996; 1295: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies located drug sites I and II in subdomains IIA and IIIA, respectively, and provided the first detailed description of the geometry and chemistry of the binding environment (10He X.M. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar). Several reports have analyzed structural aspects of the binding of an aspirin analogue, 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIB), to defatted HSA (10He X.M. Carter D.C.

We investigated to which extent these differences are determined by α1D itself by analyzing the biophysical and pharmacological properties of cloned human α1D splice variants in tsA-201 cells. Variant α1D<sub>8A,</sub>containing exon 8A sequence in repeat I, yielded α1D protein and L-type currents, whereas no intact protein and currents were observed after expression with exon 8B. In whole cell patch-clamp recordings (charge carrier 15–20 mm Ba<sup>2+</sup>), α1D<sub>8A</sub> - mediated currents activated at more negative voltages (activation threshold, −45.7 <i>versus</i> −31.5 mV,<i>p</i> < 0.05) and more rapidly (τ<sub>act</sub> for maximal inward currents 0.8 <i>versus</i> 2.3 ms;<i>p</i> < 0.05) than currents mediated by rabbit α1C. Inactivation during depolarizing pulses was slower than for α1C (current inactivation after 5-s depolarizations by 90<i>versus</i> 99%, <i>p</i> < 0.05) but faster than for LTCCs in IHCs. The sensitivity for the dihydropyridine (DHP) L-type channel blocker isradipine was 8.5-fold lower than for α1C. Radioligand binding experiments revealed that this was not due to a lower affinity for the DHP binding pocket, suggesting that differences in the voltage-dependence of DHP block account for decreased sensitivity of D-LTCCs. Our experiments show that α1D<sub>8A</sub>subunits can form slowly inactivating LTCCs activating at more negative voltages than α1C. These properties should allow D-LTCCs to control physiological processes, such as diastolic depolarization in sinoatrial node cells, neurotransmitter release in IHCs and neuronal excitability."

Whereas PKA phosphorylation is activated by cAMP (1Skålhegg B.S. Taskén K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D678-D693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PDEs degrade cAMP and inactivate the cAMP signal (2Conti M. Jin S.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular targeting of components in the cAMP signaling pathway is essential to elicit discrete cellular effects. Compartmentalization of PKA is mediated by interaction with a number of protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (3Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), whereas little is known about subcellular targeting of PDEs even though examples of interactions with putative anchor proteins is now emerging as shown e.g. for PDE4D3 (4Verde I.

Here we have investigated the colocalization of PDE4D and PKA regulatory subunits in an endocrine cell and provided evidence that PDE4D3 and PKA are in a functional complex coordinated by AKAP450. Sertoli cell primary cultures were prepared from testes of 19-day-old Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (B&K Universal AS, Nittedal, Norway) according to the method of Dorrington et al. (34Dorrington J.H. Rolles N.F. Fritz I.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1975; 3: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) with some modifications (6Øyen O. Frøysa A. Sandberg M. Eskild W. Joseph D. Hansson V.

The cells were plated in 10-cm culture dishes (Nunc, Copenhagen, Denmark) for protein analysis and cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.; Grand Island, NY) with addition of streptomycin (100 mg/liter), penicillin (105 IU/liter), fungizone (0.25 mg/liter), l-glutamine (2 mm), and fetal calf serum (10% Life Technologies, Inc.) at 32 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. After 3 days, the cells were incubated further in serum-free modified minimum essential medium. For immunocytochemistry, Sertoli cells were plated densely to avoid overgrowth of peritubular cells, cultured for 4 days to allow release of germinal cells, and then trypsinized and replated on glass coverslips at lower density to allow examination of single cells. Sertoli cells (10 culture dishes; 10 cm; ∼12 × 106 cells/dish) were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped in isotonic buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm benzamidine, 2 mm PMSF, and CompleteTM antiprotease mix; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), homogenized (Dounce homogenizer, 10 strokes), and centrifuged at 200,000 × g.

Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence analyses were performed as described elsewhere (7Collas P. Courvalin J.C. Poccia D. J.

A24 antibody was raised against a purified recombinant fragment of the chicken AKAP450, affinity purified and characterized and shown to specifically interact with human AKAP450. 2W. A. Kemmner, unpublished observations. The anti-GFP antibody was from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). We investigated localization of PDEs in Sertoli cell primary cultures that are highly hormonally responsive and known to contain isoforms of the cAMP-specific PDE4D (14Vicini E. Conti M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 839-850PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation of Sertoli cells from 19-day-old rats revealed the presence of a soluble PDE4D1/2 (Fig. 1 a,S200), which was highly inducible by cAMP (compare basal (B) versus stimulated (S)). Furthermore, an insoluble PDE4D3 isoform was observed in the pellet from the 200,000 × g fractionation, a majority of which could be solubilized by non-ionic detergent (Fig. 1 a,Tx-100). In addition, a minor pool of PDE4D3 that remained in the pellet after repeated detergent extraction could be extracted by a RIPA buffer containing 0.1% SDS (Fig. 1, a andb, RIPA). In agreement with observations made in thyroid cells, the level of PDE4D3 was not regulated by cAMP (15Jin S.L. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Examination of PKA distribution revealed RIIα associated with soluble and particulate fractions, whereas RIIβ was present at lower levels but was induced by cAMP in all cellular compartments (as described previously in Refs. 16Landmark B.F. Fauske B. Eskild W. Skålhegg B.S. Lohmann S.M. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Beebe S.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2345-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and 17Taskén K.A. Knutsen H.K. Attramadal H. Taskén K. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. Eskild W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Notably, induction of RIIβ by cAMP seemed to displace RIIα from the particulate fraction. RIα was mainly present in the soluble fraction but appeared also in particulate fractions after cAMP treatment. Investigation of the PDE4D subcellular distribution by immunostaining demonstrated distinct perinuclear dots (Fig.2 a, upper andlower panels, green label) that could be identified as centrosomes by co-labeling with a centrosomal marker (compare Figs. 2 c and 4 a). In addition, some weaker and more disperse staining was observed in the Golgi region that could account for the detergent-soluble PDE4D3. In co-staining with RIIα, PDE4D and RIIα co-localized, but RIIα had a wider distribution in the Golgi-centrosomal area (Fig. 2 a,red label; co-localization appears yellow) as also described for a number of other cell types (12Keryer G. Skalhegg B.S. Landmark B.F. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Taskén K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, RIIβ was only detected at low levels in the Golgi-centrosomal region of unstimulated cells and was distinctly co-localized with PDE4D in the centrosomal region of cAMP-treated cells (Fig. 2 a,lower panels). Cyclic AMP treatment also induced strong labeling of PDE4D in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 a, right panels). This staining most likely represents the cAMP-induced soluble PDE4D1/2 described in Fig. 1, as fixation with cold methanol extracted the cytoplasmic PDE4D staining (Fig. 2 b). Dual immunofluorescence labeling of cAMP-treated Sertoli cells for RIIβ and a well-characterized centrosomal marker, CTR453 (13Bailly E. Doree M. Nurse P. Bornens M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3985-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), revealed a full overlap in the merged image (Fig. 2 c). This implies that RIIβ and PDE4D (Fig. 2 a, lower right panel) are targeted to the centrosomal region. Compared with the immunoreactive PKA and PDE4D in the soluble S200 fraction, there is an apparent lack of cytoplasmatic PKA and PDE by immunostaining, presumably because such diffuse signals are below the detection level.Figure 4AKAP450 harbors a signaling unit consisting of PKA and PDE4D. a, dual immunostaining of PDE4D (M3S1 mAb, green, 20 μg/ml) and AKAP450 (a24 antibody, red, 6 μg/ml).

Cells were lysed in isotonic buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmPMSF, and CompleteTM antiprotease mix), centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and subjected to anti-GFP immunoblotting (Input, left panels). Extracts containing equal amounts of GFP·AKAP450/GFP (and PDE4D, not shown) were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody (1:100 dilution) and analyzed by Western blot for the presence of PDE4D and RIIα (right panels). A representative of three experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate the physical association of PDE4D and PKA type II in the centrosomal region, Triton X-100-insoluble fractions from cAMP-treated Sertoli cells were solubilized in RIPA buffer and photoaffinity-labeled by 8-azido-[32P]cAMP to visualize all R subunits. This approach demonstrated the presence of specifically labeled RII (α and β) as well as RI (Fig.3 a, Input). Addition of excess unlabeled cAMP in the photoaffinity reaction showed specificity of labeling. Immunoprecipitation of photoaffinity-labeled extracts with PDE4D-specific antibody (mAb M3S1) showed co-precipitation of RIIα and RIIβ but not RI, whereas no precipitation was observed in controls with non-immune IgG (Fig.3 a, two right lanes). Conversely, immunoprecipitation of both RIIα and RIIβ co-precipitated PDE4D3 from RIPA extracts of cAMP-treated Sertoli cells (Fig. 3 band not shown). No co-precipitation was observed in soluble fractions containing only PDE4D2, indicating specificity of the interaction (Fig.3 c). In addition, immunoaffinity chromatography of cytoskeletal extracts from FRTL-5 cells using an anti-PDE4D-specific antibody retained RII together with PDE4D (not shown). These data demonstrate that PDE4D3 and RII are in a complex probably located in the centrosomal region. On the basis of the extraction data and immunofluorescence observations, we cannot exclude localization of PDE4D3 also in the Golgi, as shown in thyroid cells (15Jin S.L. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).

As the epitope of the centrosomal marker used for dual staining with PKA in Fig.2 c also maps to AKAP450,2 PKA is also co-localized with the AKAP450·PDE4D complex in Sertoli cells. Furthermore, PDE4D3 and PKA-RIIα were detected in AKAP450 immune precipitates from extracts of partially purified centrosome-nuclei complexes (Fig. 4 b, upper panels). Conversely, anti-PDE4D co-precipitated AKAP450 (lower panel). Finally, expression of a soluble fragment of AKAP450 (amino acids 1710–2872) fused to GFP-bound PDE4D3 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation of GFP·AKAP450 and PDE4D3 when co-transfected into 293T cells (Fig.4 c). In contrast, overlapping fragments spanning the other domains of AKAP450 did not associate with PDE4D3 when co-expressed (not shown). The interaction between AKAP450 and PKA-RIIα has been previously demonstrated (20Witczak O. Skalhegg B.S. Keryer G. Bornens M. Taskén K. Jahnsen T. Orstavik S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1858-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and RIIα, endogenously expressed in 293T cells, was co-precipitated with GFP·AKAP450 and PDE4D3 (Fig.4 c, lower panel) (21Schmidt P.H. Dransfield D.T. Claudio J.O. Hawley R.G. Trotter K.W. Milgram S.L. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3055-3066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutation of the RII binding domain (L2556P) to abolish PKA binding (20Witczak O. Skalhegg B.S. Keryer G. Bornens M. Taskén K. Jahnsen T. Orstavik S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1858-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) did not affect the interaction of PDE4D3 with AKAP450, indicating that the interaction is direct and not dependent on PKA (not shown). Collectively, the data presented here indicate the presence of a signaling complex consisting of PKA and PDE both assembled via a common anchoring protein. Because the components of this complex are present at low levels in the insoluble fraction, the stoichiometry of the complex is difficult to assess quantitatively. However, based on examination of input lysates and supernatants following immunoprecipitation, it appears that all the PDE4D3 and AKAP450 in the RIPA fraction goes into a PDE4D3·PKA·AKAP450 complex, whereas a part (5–20%) of PKA RIIα and/or RIIβ is in a complex with AKAP450 and PDE4D3. This is consistent with earlier observations of PKA associated with other cytoskeletal structures and other AKAPs in the insoluble material. Targeting of PKA and PDE in close proximity to the PKA substrate will allow for a tight control of the phosphorylation state of proteins regulated by cAMP signaling. Spatial control is achieved by targeting of PKA. Temporal control and inactivation of the effect of cAMP on PKA is accomplished by complexing of PDE at the same site (Fig.5). It should also be noted that the particular PDE4D3 variant that co-localizes with PKA RII can be phosphorylated and activated by PKA. Therefore, the physical association of PKA and PDE4D3 establishes a local feedback regulation whereby cAMP activates PKA by dissociation of C, which in turn phosphorylates and activates PDE4D3 (15Jin S.L. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The resulting decrease in cAMP causes reassociation of C and inactivation of PKA, rather than diffusion of C into the cytoplasm. The proximity of PKA and PDE and this rapid feedback mechanism indicate that the cAMP response may occur only in a confined compartment of the cell. Several AKAPs have been shown to serve as anchoring proteins for multiple signal molecules to form signaling complexes where signals can be modulated by co-localization of PKA and protein phosphatases (25Coghlan V.M.

The PKA·PDE complex facilitated by dual anchoring via AKAP450 adds to this list and provides a way of modulating signal intensity at the level of cAMP. Furthermore, the capacity of AKAP450 to anchor PDE4D extends the functions of this large protein that has already been shown to anchor PKA, protein kinase N, and PP1 (20Witczak O. Skalhegg B.S.

Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The fact that centrosomal PKA, at least in some cells, have a co-targeted PDE suggests the importance of a tight regulation of the phosphorylation state of centrosomal proteins, possibly implicated in regulation of microtubule stability where cAMP has a distinct regulatory effect (19Fernandez A. Cavadore J.C. Demaille J. Lamb N.J. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1995; 1: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 30Gavet O. Ozon S. Manceau V. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J.

It will be interesting to determine whether PKA and PDEs also co-localize at other sites of PKA action where a tightly regulated mechanism of termination of the cAMP signal is important.

May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). Processes involving activation of NF-κB regulate responses to stress, inflammation and viral infection, the communication between cells, embryonic development, and the maintenance of cell type specific expression of genes. Activation of NF-κB is furthermore required for transcriptional activation and subsequent release of many mediators including the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (2Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation, i.e. the IL-1-receptor pathway, encompass a cascade of signal transducing proteins. The adapter protein MyD88 is recruited to the receptor complex upon ligand binding (3Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z.

The nine currently known human TLRs exhibit homology with theDrosophila Toll family also comprising at least nine members (23Tauszig S. Jouanguy E. Hoffmann J.A. Imler J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The Toll protein was the first member of this protein family described as a key player in embryonic development and contributes to defense against fungal infection in the adult fly (24Lemaitre B.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6120-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Similar to the IL-1-induced NF-κB induction, TLRs initiated the signaling cascade by the so-called intracellular cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain TLRs have in common with the IL-1 receptor (15Gay N.J.

Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) are present in the cell wall of most Gram-positive bacteria and are linked to the cytoplasmic membrane (42Lambert P.A. Hancock I.C. Baddiley J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 472: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Most widespread are poly(glycerophosphate) LTAs such as the ones found in Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis(43Iwasaki H. Shimada A. Yokoyama K. Ito E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 424-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Polotsky V.Y. Fischer W. Ezekowitz R.A. Joiner K.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 380-383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are macroamphiphiles commonly consisting of hydrophilic polyglycerol phosphate chains and a diacylglycerol lipid anchor (45Fischer W. Rosel P. FEBS Lett. 1980; 119: 224-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). LTAs exhibit immunostimulatory activity such as cytokine induction (46Bhakdi S. Klonisch T. Nuber P. Fischer W. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4614-4620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,47De Kimpe S.J. Kengatharan M. Thiemermann C. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10359-10363Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It thus was tempting to speculate that LTAs also utilize TLRs for activation of immune cells. However, results obtained in different cell systems have been controversial, and the role of TLRs in LTA-induced cell stimulation has not been completely understood; S. aureus and Streptococcus sanguis LTA induced IL-6 and nitric oxide in macrophages from wild-type and TLR-2-deficient mice, but not in macrophages from TLR-4-deficient mice (48Takeuchi O.

In contrast, overexpression of TLR-2 in HEK293 cells conferred inducibility of NF-κB in response to B. subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. sanguis LTAs (38Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H.

Recently, an improved isolation procedure employing butanol has been shown to result in pure and biologically highly active LTAs (49Morath S. Geyer A. Hartung T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Previously we have reported on the isolation of two novelTreponema species, T. maltophilum, associated with peridontitis in humans, and T. brennaborense, found in bovine cattle disease (50Choi B.K.

Bacteriol. 1999; 49: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Isolated membrane glycolipids of both treponemes, which share structural characteristics with LTAs, stimulate mononuclear cells to release TNF-α in a CD14- and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein-dependent fashion (53Schröder N.W.J. Opitz B. Lamping N. Michelsen K.S. Zähringer U. Göbel U.B. Schumann R.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2683-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In order to identify the TLRs involved in stimulation of immune cells by Treponema glycolipids and LTAs, these two different glycolipids, highly purified butanol-extracted LTAs from B. subtilis and S. aureus, and, as control, LPS were used for stimulation of cells differing in their TLR expression pattern. Our results confirm our previous findings and indicate that NF-κB activation by these stimuli is induced mainly by TLR-2, however, with additional utilization of TLR-4 potentially depending on the chemical composition of the particular microbial component employed. Frozen stocks of T. brennaborense and T. maltophilum cells (300 μl, each stored at −80 °C) were inoculated in 3 ml of a culture medium (OMIZ-Pat) as described previously (51Wyss C. Choi B.K. Schupbach P. Guggenheim B. Göbel U.B. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1996; 46: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Bacteria were cultured anaerobically (Anaerogen, Oxoid, Germany) at 37 °C for 3–4 days. The cultures were then transferred to a larger volume of OMIZ-Pat (20–100 ml) and further incubated for 1–2 days. Viability of the treponemes and exclusion of contaminating bacteria were assessed by dark field microscopy (400-fold magnification, BH2-RFCA microscope, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). Sterility controls of the medium were performed by incubating OMIZ-Pat medium under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 37 °C for 1 week. The pH value of the culture medium was measured repeatedly. Cultures were stopped at pH 6.0 and centrifuged at 12,000 × gat 4 °C for 20 min. For some experiments, at this point whole treponeme cells were resuspended in H2O, washed twice, and frozen. For glycolipid extraction, aqueous suspensions of treponeme cells were digested with RNase (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), DNase (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and proteinase K (Merck). The suspensions were dialyzed and extracted using a hot phenol/water extraction method (54Westphal O. Jann K. Whistler R.L. Methods in Carbohydrate Chemistry. 5th Ed. Academic Press, New York1965: 83Google Scholar). In brief, the phenol/water extraction was performed by mixing the cell suspension with an equal volume of 90% phenol and stirring at 68 °C for 10 min. After cooling on ice, the mixture was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 0 °C, and the upper phase was collected. This procedure was repeated twice, and combined phases were dialyzed and lyophilized. LPS contamination was thoroughly investigated by Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay and other methods and could be clearly ruled out. This has been published elsewhere (53Schröder N.W.J. Opitz B. Lamping N. Michelsen K.S. Zähringer U. Göbel U.B. Schumann R.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2683-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A mock extract including all media and chemicals that were used during extraction was tested in all assays. B. subtilis (DSMZ 1087) and S. aureus (DSM20233) were grown in a 8-liter shaker and a 35-liter fermentor, respectively. After harvesting by centrifugation at 4 °C and 8000 rpm, the pelleted bacteria were sonicated (Branson Sonifier, Branson, Schwäbisch-Gemünd, Germany) on ice and extracted with butanol at room temperature (49Morath S. Geyer A. Hartung T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The aqueous phase was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) on octyl-Sepharose. Fractions were screened for phosphorus-rich LTA by a phosphomolybdene blue assay (55Schnittker H. Papenberg Ganse E. Biochem. Z. 1959; 332: 167-185PubMed Google Scholar); positive fractions were pooled. All LTA-preparations were negative in a chromogenic Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (QCL-1000, Bio Whittaker, Walkersville, MD), i.e. they contained less than 30 pg of LPS/mg of LTA from B. subtilisand less than 6 pg of LPS/mg of LTA from S. aureus. The purity of the preparations was estimated by NMR analysis to be ≥99%. 1.6 × 106 RAW264.7 cells/well were cultured in six-well tissue culture plates overnight in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies Ltd, Paisley, United Kingdom) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). After two washing steps with RPMI 1640, cells were starved for 3 h in the absence of FCS. Stimulation with whole treponemes, Treponema glycolipids, LTAs from B. subtilis and S. aureus, Escherichia coli0111:B4 LPS (Sigma), or Streptococcus minnesota LPS (Sigma) for 1 h was performed in the presence of 2% non-heat-inactivated FCS. In certain experiments, RAW264.7 cells were incubated with the anti-TLR-4-MD-2 antibody MTS510 (30Akashi S. Shimazu R. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Takeda K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3471-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), at concentrations of 5 μg/ml for 1 h prior to stimulation. CHO cells transfected with human CD14 (generously provided by L. Hamann, Forschungszentrum Borstel, Borstel, Germany) were cultured with Ham's nutrient medium F-12 (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Linz, Austria) supplemented with 10% FCS and 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). 4 × 105 CHO/CD14 cells were plated in six-well tissue culture plates. At the next morning, cells were starved in FCS-free Ham's medium for 3 h before stimulation withTreponema glycolipids, LTAs, or E. coli 0111:B4 LPS (Sigma) in the presence of 2% non-heat-inactivated FCS. After 1 h cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4, and incubated in 150 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm NaF). After 20 min, cells were harvested mechanically, transferred to 1.5-ml tubes, mixed with 25 μl of Nonidet P-40, and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C for 1 min. Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer B (400 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmleupeptin, and 1 mm NaF), incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, spun at 13.000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and supernatants containing nuclear proteins were collected. The binding activity of NF-κB in the extracts was determined by a standard electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Briefly, 4 μg of the extracts were incubated with radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′, containing the consensus NF-κB DNA site, and electrophoresis was performed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. To assess induction of TNF-α, 5 × 104 cells/well of RAW264.7 cells were cultured overnight in 96-well tissue culture plates. The cells were stimulated withTreponema extracts, LTAs, or E. coli 0111:B4 LPS (Sigma) in the presence of 2% non-heat-inactivated FCS, and supernatants were harvested after 4 h of incubation. MaxiSorp ELISA plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 3 μg/ml anti-mTNF Ab (PharMingen, Heidelberg, Germany) in 100 mmNa3PO4, pH 6.0. Samples and recombinant mTNF standard (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) were incubated at room temperature for 3 h, and detection was performed with 500 ng/ml biotin-conjugated anti mTNF-α Ab (PharMingen), and 1 μg/ml streptavidin-peroxidase with ortho-phenylene diphosphate (OPD) as substrate (Sigma). For measurement of human IL-6, 3.75 × 104 cells/well of U373MG cells (33Hirschfeld M. Kirschning C.J. Schwandner R. Wesche H. Weis J.H. Wooten R.M. Weis J.J. J.

In certain experiments, U373MG cells were incubated with the anti-TLR-4 antibody HTA125 (57Akashi S. Ogata H. Kirikae F. Kirikae T. Kawasaki K. Nishijima M. Shimazu R. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) at concentrations of 5 μg/ml for 1 h prior to stimulation. On the next day, the cells were incubated overnight with Treponemaglycolipids, LTAs, or E. coli 0111:B4 LPS (Sigma) in the presence of 5% AB serum. MaxiSorp ELISA plates were incubated with 3 μg/ml anti-hIL-6 capture Ab (R&D) in 100 mmNa2CO3, pH 8.3. Samples and IL-6 standard (R&D Systems) were incubated at room temperature for 2 h, detection was performed employing 25 ng/ml biotinylated anti hIL-6 Ab (R&D Systems), and substrate reaction was carried out as in the TNF-α ELISA. Treponema phenol/water extracts were separated by HIC. HIC was performed on an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) using an octyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An increasing linear gradient (15–60%) of propanol-1 in ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.7) was used as elution buffer with a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. 500 μl of each fraction was dried and resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. For induction of IL-6 in U373MG or TNF-α in RAW264.7 cells, 10 μl of each fraction were used. To induce NF-κB in CHO/CD14 or RAW264.7 cells, 10 μl of each fraction 40–60 or 61–80 were mixed and cells were incubated with 2 μl of the pooled fractions. Expression plasmids for TLR-2 and the dominant-negative mutants of MyD88 and NIK were generated as described (17Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Merrill Ayres T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Briefly 3 × 105 HEK293 cells (Tularik, San Francisco, CA) were cultured in six-well plates with DMEM (Life Technologies Ltd) supplemented with 10% FCS. HEK293 cells were transfected the following day by the calcium phosphate precipitation method following the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with 0.5 μg of ELAM-1 luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase plasmid to normalize for transfection efficiency, and 0.2 μg of empty vector or TLR-2 expression vector. In some experiments 0.1 μg of dominant-negative mutants of MyD88 or NIK were transfected. On the following day, cells were incubated with Treponema glycolipids or LTAs in the presence of 2% non-heat-inactivated FCS for 6 h, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was measured by using the Luciferase Reporter-Gene Assay high sensitivity and the β-Gal Reporter-Gene Assay from Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from C3H/HeJ or C3H/HeN mice (Charles River, Sulzbach, Germany), by thioglycollate elicidation. Female 7-week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1.5 ml of 3% thioglycollate broth (Sifin, Berlin, Germany). After 3 days (C3H/HeN) or after 5 days (C3H/HeJ), mice were sacrificed and peritoneal macrophages were harvested by injection of 10 ml of ice-cold Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (Life Technologies) intraperitoneally followed by aspiration. Cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640, and 1 × 106 cells were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates in RPMI containing 5% FCS. At the next day, plates were washed twice with RPMI to remove non-adherent cells, and remaining cells were stimulated with Treponema glycolipids, LTAs, or S. minnesota LPS (Sigma) in RPMI containing 2% non-heat-inactivated FCS for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared and EMSA was performed as described previously. First we examined the ability of glycolipids from T. brennaborense and T. maltophilum, LTAs from B. subtilis and S. aureus, and E. coli 0111:B4 LPS to induce nuclear translocation of NF-κB in different cell lines. We exposed the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 to increasing concentrations of different bacterial components for 1 h and subsequently subjected the nuclear proteins to EMSA.Treponema glycolipids, LTAs, and LPS caused NF-κB activation in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1).T. brennaborense exhibited a slightly increased ability to stimulate these cells as compared with T. maltophilum. A mock extract including all media and chemicals used during phenol/water extraction of treponemes failed to exhibit significant stimulation. To examine the role of TLR-2 in responses to Treponemaglycolipids and LTAs from B. subtilis and S. aureus, we used CHO cells transfected with CD14. These cells carry a frameshift mutation in the TLR-2 gene lacking a functional TLR-2 transcript (58Heine H. Kirschning C.J. Lien E. Monks B.G. Rothe M. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6971-6975PubMed Google Scholar). CHO/CD14 cells respond to exposure of increasing concentrations of LPS and T. brennaborense by enhanced translocation of NF-κB. In contrast, T. maltophilum and both LTAs failed to induce NF-κB even at higher concentrations (Fig.1). Next we addressed the influence of TLR-2 expression on cytokine induction by Treponemaglycolipids and LTAs by employing the TLR-2-negative human astrocytoma cell line U373MG (33Hirschfeld M. Kirschning C.J. Schwandner R. Wesche H. Weis J.H. Wooten R.M. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2382-2386PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 concentrations in the supernatants were measured after incubation of U373MG cells with different bacterial components. LPS and T. brennaborense were effective in inducing IL-6 production in a dose-dependent manner, whereas T. maltophilum caused only marginal IL-6 induction. Both LTAs completely failed to stimulate IL-6 production in U373MG cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, in the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7, both Treponemaglycolipids, LTAs, and LPS induced TNF-α production as expected (data not shown).

The mechanisms and molecular factors integrating these interactions are just beginning to be understood. It has become increasingly clear that phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)1 and its derivatives, phosphorylated separately or in all possible combinations on d-3, d-4, or d-5 positions of the inositol head group (called collectively phosphoinositides, PI), are key elements in both the constitutive and regulated membrane traffic (for recent reviews, see Refs. 2Fruman D.A.

This notion is supported by studies in yeast and mammalian cells demonstrating defects in membrane trafficking events upon inactivation of the enzymes responsible for PI biosynthesis and vice versa, activation of transport steps (for example GLUT4-vesicle dynamics) upon overproduction of the PI-generating enzyme activities. A major group of the proteins implicated in the generation of vesicle carriers or regulation of their fusion with the target membrane are PI-binding molecules implying that site- and time-specific PI production and PI-protein interactions are crucial for membrane trafficking events. Recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest a distinct function of PtdIns 3,5-P2 intracellular levels in yeast membrane trafficking (9Gary J.D. Wurmser A.E. Bonangelino C.J. Weisman L.S. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 10Cooke F.T. Dove S.K. McEwen R.K. Painter G. Holmes A.B. Hall M.N. Michell R.H. Parker P.J. Curr.

The major phenotypic characteristics resulting from inactivation of yeast fab1, whose gene product is responsible for the intracellular PtdIns 3,5-P2 production, include severe growth defect and extremely enlarged vacuoles that occupy the majority of the cell (9Gary J.D. Wurmser A.E. Bonangelino C.J. Weisman L.S. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar,12Yamamoto A. DeWald D.B. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Emr S.D. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. 1995; 6: 525-539Google Scholar). Despite these severe defects, however, all transport pathways to the vacuole in Fab1p-deficient cells appear intact (11Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Emr and collaborators (11Odorizzi G. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 1998; 95: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) therefore suggest that Fab1p kinase and PtdIns 3,5-P2 function to maintain vacuolar size and membrane homeostasis by regulating recycling/turnover of membranes from the yeast vacuolar surface to earlier compartments. PIKfyve (phosphoinositide kinase for five position containing a fyve finger) appears to be the mammalian ortholog of Fab1p lipid kinase that rescues the vacuolar defects in the Δfab1 yeast strain (13Shisheva A. Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14McEwen R.K. Dove S.K. Cooke F.T. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Shisheva A. Ohya Y. Parker P.J. Michell R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33905-33912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In vitro, PIKfyve lipid kinase synthesizes PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2 in a wortmannin-resistant fashion (ID50, 600 nm) (15Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that PIKfyve is also a protein kinase that likely acts in intact cells to modulate PIKfyve lipid kinase activity and/or specificity by autophosphorylation (16Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15980-15989Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PIKfyve partitions between the soluble and membrane-bound intracellular pools: the membrane-bound populations being visualized as distinct vesicles largely positive for late endosomal markers, but not for protein residents of earlier compartments in the endocytic pathway (17Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This characteristic intracellular localization is most likely conferred by PIKfyve's FYVE finger, a PtdIns 3-P-binding protein module found in other mammalian proteins as a major localization determinant for the endosomal membranes, enriched in PtdIns 3-P (7Stenmark H. Aasland R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4175-4183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.-M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). However, despite this intensive characterization, the functions of PIKfyve enzymatic activity as well as the identity of its lipid or protein products in the context of live mammalian cells remain unknown. In this study we report the essential role of PIKfyve enzymatic activity in cell morphology and intracellular membrane integrity by characterization of a PIKfyve kinase-dead point mutant. Mammalian cells expressing PIKfyveK1831E display a dominant phenotype characterized by progressive, but reversible, PIKfyve-vesicle dilation and vacuolation of membranes with endocytic origin. Because high levels of PIKfyveWT increase selectively the endogenous PtdIns 3,5-P2 production in these cells, we conclude that PIKfyve enzymatic activity, likely through PtdIns 3,5-P2production, plays an essential role to maintain cell morphology by regulating late endocytic membrane homeostasis. COS-7 and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate.

EGFP-HA-PIKfyveΔCH (Δ560–1231) and Δfyve(Δ177–198) truncated mutants were generated by replacing the full-length PIKfyveS released as a XbaI fragment from pEGFP-HA-PIKfyveS cDNA, with the corresponding fragments from pCMV5-HA-PIKfyveSΔCH and pCMV5-HA-PIKfyveSΔfyve, respectively. pEGFP-HA-PIKfyveSK1831EΔfyve and pEGFP-HA-PIKfyveSK1831E were generated by replacing the KpnI/SalI fragment in pEGFP-HA-PIKfyveSΔfyve and theXbaI/SalI insert in pEGFP-HA-PIKfyveSwith the corresponding fragments from pCMV5-HA-PIKfyveSK1831E cDNA. COS-7 cells, seeded on 22 × 22-mm coverslips were transfected with the cDNA constructs indicated in the figure legends by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were then processed for fluorescence microscopy at the indicated posttransfection time or further treated as described below. Cells transfected with HA-PIKfyve constructs in pCMV5 were detected with anti-HA monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies and Texas red-coupled goat anti-mouse or CY3-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG, respectively, following fixation (4% formaldehyde) and washing as described previously (17Shisheva A.

Cells transfected with pEGFP constructs were detected by the GFP fluorescence signal following cell fixation or directly in live cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with PIKfyve constructs in an adenoviral plasmid (see below). Coverslips were mounted on slides using the Slow Fade Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence analyses were performed with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 310) using a 63/1.4 oil or 40/0.75 water immersion lense and a standard green fluorescence filter (for GFP). The levels of overexpressed EGFP-PIKfyve constructs were compared with that of the endogenous PIKfyve by Western blotting with anti-PIKfyve antibodies as described previously (17Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses, expressing HA-tagged PIKfyveS and GFP (AdPIKfyve), or GFP alone (AdEmpty), were generated by the AdEasy system (kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein, Ref. 19He T.-C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3264) Google Scholar). Briefly, HA-PIKfyveS was first cloned into pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector, engineered with two separate CMV promoters for expression of GFP, and for expression of PIKfyveS, respectively. For this purpose the N-terminal part of PIKfyveS, released by BglII-KpnI from pEGFP-HA-PIKfyveS, and the KpnI-SalI C-terminal part taken from pCMV5-HA-PIKfyveS, were ligated into a BglII-SalI-digested shuttle vector. The resultant shuttle construct or an “empty” shuttle vector was linearized with PmeI and co-transformed with pAdEasy-1 adenoviral backbone plasmid into Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells. Selected recombinants were confirmed by restriction mapping, linearized with PacI, and used to transfect a HEK293 adenovirus packaging cell line with LipofectAMINE. Two weeks posttransfection the cells were harvested. The viruses were extracted by freeze-thaw and subsequent centrifugation. This viral extract was used for further viral propagation in HEK293 cells. Viral stocks were purified by ultracentrifugation in two discontinuous CsCl2 gradients and subsequent passage through a Nap 10 column (Sephadex G25, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified viral stocks were titrated, and the lowest dilution resulting in 100% infection of HEK293 cells 18 h postinfection (monitored by the GFP signals) was defined as multiplicity of infection = 1. The adenovirus-mediated overexpression and enzymatic activity of PIKfyve were confirmed by Western blotting and lipid kinase assays, performed under previously specified conditions (15Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transfected with pCMV5 PIKfyveK1831E cDNAs were infected 24 h posttransfection with recombinant adenoviruses expressing PIKfyve and GFP, or control GFP. Twenty-four to 48 h postinfection the cells were fixed, processed for fluorescence microscopy, and observed under a 63/1.4 oil immersion lens. In some experiments COS-7 cells transfected with pEGFP-HA-PIKfyveWT were treated 24 h posttransfection with NHCl4 (20 mm) or wortmannin (800 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C and then examined live by confocal microscopy with a 40/0.75 water immersion lens. COS-7 cells seeded on 60-mm dishes were transfected with pCMV5-HA-PIKfyveWT or only pCMV5 cDNAs by electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II electroporator), a technique reaching >90% cell transfection efficiency (20Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31107-31114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-T or HEK293 cells (60-mm dishes) were infected with adenoviruses expressing PIKfyveWT and GFP, or only GFP at multiplicity of infection = 1. Fluorescence microscopy of the infected cells indicated ∼100% efficiency 24 h posttransduction. Forty-eight hours posttransfection or 24 h postinfection, the cells were washed in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then labeled for 3 h at 37 °C in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.6 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (21Nave B.T.

Cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped with CH3OH/1m HCl (1:1) in the presence of 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm tetrabutylammonium sulfate, as a reagent increasing PI extraction (22Grove R.I. Fitzpatrick D. Schimmel S.D. Lipids. 1981; 16: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Extracted radiolabeled lipids were deacylated and analyzed by HPLC with 3H-labeled GroPIns 3-P, GroPIns 4-P, GroPIns 5-P, and GroPIns 4,5-P2 internal or32P-labeled GroPIns 3,4-P2 and GroPIns 3,5-P2 external standards under previously specified conditions (15Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To determine the function of PIKfyve enzymatic activity in mammalian cells we have used a catalytically deficient HA-tagged form of PIKfyve, bearing a single point mutation at Lys1831 proposed as a candidate ATP-binding site (16Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15980-15989Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Lack of both lipid and protein kinase activity for this PIKfyveK1831E point mutant was demonstrated in vitro by the complete inability of the HA immunoprecipitates derived from lysates of PIKfyveK1831E-transfected COS cells to synthesize PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2 or to autophosphorylate (16Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O.C. Shisheva A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15980-15989Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transient transfection in COS cells with HA-PIKfyveK1831E cDNA engineered in mammalian expression vectors pCMV5 or pEGFP resulted in a drastic dominant phenotype, readily seen upon observation of live cells under a light microscope. Approximately 15 h posttransfection, large vacuoles appeared as round structures, initially at the perinuclear region and 24 h posttransfections, throughout the whole cytoplasm with a tendency to increase in size and decrease in number within the observation period (72 h posttransfections). In some cells expressing PIKfyveK1831E at higher levels, two to three giant vacuoles could be seen 2 days posttransfection, most likely having arisen as a result of fusion, reaching diameters of 5–10 µm and comprising the majority of the cell volume. The intracellular appearance of PIKfyveK1831E also underwent a dramatic change. The first alterations, which actually preceded the formation of the large vacuoles were associated with dilation of the PIKfyveK1831E-containing vesicles as revealed by fluorescence signals associated with anti-HA antibodies (Fig.1) or GFP (data not shown). With the progression of cell vacuolation, the fluorescence signals detected PIKfyveK1831E-containing dilated vesicles distributed between the empty vacuoles or in some instances on the limiting membrane of the vacuoles typically at the perinuclear region (Fig. 1). The vacuoles at the cell periphery were typically negative for PIKfyveK1831E. The lumen of the vacuoles was free of PIKfyveK1831E and appeared as an empty, lucent space in phase contrast images from a confocal microscope (Fig. 1). The cell vacuolation was striking and unequivocal and was detected even in cells for which the HA immunofluorescence or GFP fluorescence signals of expressed PIKfyveK1831E were only slightly above the background level. Western blotting with anti-PIKfyve antibodies of lysates from transiently transfected COS cells showed equal intensities for the endogenous PIKfyve (∼200 kDa) and GFP-PIKfyveK1831E (230 kDa) bands (data not shown). Given the transfection efficiency in these experiments (∼40%) and the variability of overexpression in individual cells, these results support the notion that even at a low ratio (∼1:1) of the mutant to the endogenous PIKfyve, the PIKfyveK1831E point mutant induces the appearance of dilated PIKfyve-containing vesicles and abnormal vacuoles. Parallel immunofluorescence and phase contrast microscopy in COS cells transiently expressing HA-PIKfyveWTrevealed no morphological changes (Fig. 1). Consistent with our previous observations (17Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a distinct peripheral vesicular pattern of the fluorescence staining associated with expressed PIKfyveWT, along with a diffuse staining could be observed (Fig. 1). Because PIKfyveWT as well as PIKfyveK1831E largely co-localize with the late endosomal marker CI-MPR, but not with marker proteins for Golgi, early/recycling endosomes or end lysosomes (Fig. 2, Ref.17Shisheva A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, and this study, data not shown), it is conceivable that the PIKfyveK1831E-induced vacuoles originate from the late endosomal compartment.Figure 2PIKfyveK1831E-induced vacuoles originate from late endocytic/multivesicular body compartment. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pCMV5 HA-PIKfyveK1831E (a) or pCMV5 HA-PIKfyveWT cDNAs (c). Double staining with monoclonal anti-HA and polyclonal anti-CI-MPR antibodies (aand c) was performed 24 h posttransfection as described under “Experimental Procedures”, resulting in green andred fluorescence signals, respectively. The merged image, shown in a, indicates a substantial overlap between PIKfyveK1831E and CI-MPR (yellow), suggesting that the vacuoles originate from the late endocytic compartment. Shown are three PIKfyveK1831E-expressing cells and the induced cell vacuolation in the phase contrast image (b,arrows). A control merged image in c shows the large overlap between PIKfyveWT and CI-MPR as reported previously (17Shisheva A. Rusin B. Ikonomov O.C. DeMarco C. Sbrissa D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11859-11869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Bar, 10 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The dramatic and unequivocal dominant effect of PIKfyveK1831E in inducing cell vacuolation was observed in other cell types. Thus, transient transfection of HIRcB or 3T3-L1 fibroblasts with the PIKfyveK1831E cDNA in either pCMV5 or pEGFP vectors resulted in the appearance of the characteristic phenotype of multiple empty vacuoles in the PIKfyveK1831E-expressing cells (data not shown). Next, transient transfection of HEK293 cells with PIKfyveK1831Eengineered in pAdTrack CMV vector with an independent expression of GFP as a transfection reporter protein induced the characteristic dominant phenotype. Multiple lucent vacuoles were observed by phase contrast only in the cells transfected with PIKfyveK1831E but not with PIKfyveWT (Fig. 1, c and f). When viewed by the fluorescence signals of GFP, the vacuolated compartments were seen as “holes” (Fig. 1c). Although the PIKfyveK1831E-transfected cells displayed a drastically altered morphology, they were functionally active within the observation period (72 h posttransfections), as evidenced by their ability to exclude trypan blue dye or propidium iodide, to adhere to tissue culture plates subsequent to trypsinization, to endocytose materials, such as dextran (data not shown) or adenoviruses (see below), and to selectively reverse the phenotype (see below). Together these results demonstrate that expression of a kinase-dead PIKfyveK1831E point mutant induces a drastic dominant phenotype, associated with abnormal cell morphology and endocytic membrane vacuolation, and suggest a key function of the products of PIKfyve enzymatic activity in maintaining cell architecture and endomembrane homeostasis. We reasoned that if the above statement is correct then increases of PIKfyve enzymatic activity in the PIKfyveK1831E-transfected cells should reverse the cell vacuolation phenotype. To test this we introduced PIKfyveWT by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery in COS cells 24 h posttransfection with PIKfyveK1831EcDNA. Infected cells were monitored over a period of 16–90 h by the fluorescence signals of GFP expressed in parallel with HA-PIKfyveWT but under an independent promoter. The vacuoles diminished in diameter ∼16 h posttransduction and completely disappeared ∼36 h posttransduction only in those PIKfyveK1831E-expressing cells for which infections with the PIKfyveWT adenovirus could be documented (Fig.3). Conversely, the PIKfyveK1831E-expressing cells that remained noninfected with the PIKfyveWT adenovirus displayed the characteristic vacuolar phenotype until the end of the observation period (Fig. 3). Concordantly, a recombinant adenovirus encoding only GFP was ineffective in rescuing the phenotype in the PIKfyveK1831E-transfected cells within the observation period; the swollen vacuoles remained unchanged and were seen as empty “ghosts” (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that a selective expression of PIKfyveWT rescues the abnormal phenotype induced by the PIKfyveK1831E, indicating the crucial role of the PIKfyve enzymatic activity for the morphology of the vacuolating compartments. PIKfyve has a strong in vitro enzymatic activity to generate PtdIns 3,5-P2 and PtdIns 5-P (15Sbrissa D. Ikonomov O. Shisheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21589-21597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), both of which are now detected in several mammalian cell types (23Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F.

To determine the identity of the lipid products generated in intact cells, for which the vacuolar phenotype was documented, we have examined the effect of PIKfyveWT overexpression on cellular phosphoinositide levels. COS-7, HEK293, and CHO-T infected with adenovirus expressing PIKfyveWT, or transfected by electroporation at an efficiency of infection/transfection >90%, were subsequently labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and the extracted radioactive lipids analyzed by HPLC. Heterologous expression of PIKfyveWT in these cell types increased the [32P]PtdIns 3,5-P2 production by 30–55% (TableI). In some of the cell types a decrease of PtdIns 3-P could be documented (Table I). However this was not always the case, as seen in COS cells (Table I). Expressed PIKfyveWT had no significant effect on the radiolabeled levels of PtdIns 4,5-P2, PtdIns 3,4-P2, or PtdIns 4-P in the cell types studied (Table I). Surprisingly, in COS-7, HEK293, and CHO-T cells we were unable to detect any amounts of [32P]PtdIns 5-P at basal conditions or under PIKfyve heterologous expression, similarly to previous observations in resting yeast cells or upon expression of PIKfyveWT in Δfab1 strain (9Gary J.D.

FPRL1 is a promiscuous receptor activated by serum amyloid A and by different synthetic peptides, including the hexapeptide Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-d-Met-NH(2) (WKYMVm). By measuring calcium flux in HL-60 cells transfected with FPR, FPRL1, or FPRL2, we show that WKYMVm activated all three receptors, whereas the l-conformer WKYMVM activated exclusively FPRL1 and FPRL2. The functionality of FPRL2 was further assessed by the ability of HL-60-FPRL2 cells to migrate toward nanomolar concentrations of hexapeptides. The half-maximal effective concentrations of WKYMVM for calcium mobilization in HL-60-FPRL1 and HL-60-FPRL2 cells were 2 and 80 nm, respectively. Those of WKYMVm were 75 pm and 3 nm. The tritiated peptide WK[3,5-(3)H(2)]YMVM bound to FPRL1 (K(D) approximately 160 nm), but not to FPR. The two conformers similarly inhibited binding of (125)I-labeled WKYMVm to FPRL2-expressing cells (IC(50) approximately 2.5-3 micrometer). Metabolic labeling with orthophosphoric acid revealed that FPRL1 was differentially phosphorylated upon addition of the l- or d-conformer, indicating that it induced different conformational changes. In contrast to FPRL1, FPRL2 was already phosphorylated in the absence of agonist and not evenly distributed in the plasma membrane of unstimulated cells. However, both receptors were internalized upon addition of either of the two conformers. Taken together, the results indicate that neutrophils are activated by WKYMVM through FPRL1 and that FPRL2 is a chemotactic receptor transducing signals in myeloid cells."
https://openalex.org/W2084273795,"We previously showed that Ω-3 fatty acids reduce secretion of apolipoprotein B (apoB) from cultured hepatocytes by stimulating post-translational degradation. In this report, we now characterize this process, particularly in regard to the two known processes that degrade newly synthesized apoB, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation and re-uptake from the cell surface. First, we found that Ω-3-induced degradation preferentially reduces the secretion of large, assembled apoB-lipoprotein particles, and apoB polypeptide length is not a determinant. Second, based on several experimental approaches, ER-associated degradation is not involved. Third, re-uptake, the only process known to destroy fully assembled nascent lipoproteins, was clearly active in primary hepatocytes, but Ω-3-induced degradation of apoB continued even when re-uptake was blocked. Cell fractionation showed that Ω-3 fatty acids induced a striking loss of apoB100 from the Golgi, while sparing apoB100 in the ER, indicating a post-ER process. To determine the signaling involved, we used wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, which blocked most, if not all, of the Ω-3 fatty acid effect. Therefore, nascent apoB is subject to ER-associated degradation, re-uptake, and a third distinct degradative pathway that appears to target lipoproteins after considerable assembly and involves a post-ER compartment and PI3K signaling. Physiologic, pathophysiologic, and pharmacologic regulation of net apoB secretion may involve alterations in any of these three degradative steps.

Most studies have focused on apoB metabolism in the liver, given the greater contribution to the plasma apoB pool made by that organ and the availability of relatively convenient primary and transformed hepatic cell models. The apoB message level and translational rate in hepatic cells are largely constitutive, and so secretory control is achieved primarily through co- and post-translational degradation of the protein (e.g. see Refs. 2Yao Z.

Two specific mechanisms for the destruction of newly synthesized apoB in hepatic cells have been characterized. The first isendoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Newly synthesized apoB in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is initially complexed with small amounts of lipid that are thought to be shuttled by the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (5Berriot-Varoqueaux N.

Re-uptake can occur after fully assembled apoB-containing particles have been exported across the plasma membrane but before they have diffused away from the vicinity of the cell by traversing the unstirred water layer that is adjacent to the plasma membrane (15Williams K.J.

The re-uptake pathway is stimulated by sterol deprivation (15Williams K.J. Brocia R.W. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16741-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which induces LDL receptor expression (22Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

The architecture of the liver may favor re-uptake, owing to the presence of diffusional impediments, such as the space of Disse and the fenestrated endothelial barrier, through which nascent lipoproteins must pass before escape into the circulation. Because apoB and cell surface lipoprotein receptors share portions of the secretory pathway (e.g. see Refs. 25Harrison J.C. Swift L.L. LeQuire V.S. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1439-1449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Salamero J. Sztul E.S. Howell K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7717-7721Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it is likely that binding occurs within the cell as well (4Williams K.J. Fisher E.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 15Williams K.J. Brocia R.W. Fisher E.A. J. Biol.

Invest. 2000; 105: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of other agents or conditions have also been reported to reduce net output of apoB by stimulating intracellular degradation, such as severe choline deficiency (27Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acute stimulation with insulin (28Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 9-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and administration of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids with a double bond in the n-3 position, known as Ω-3 or fish oil fatty acids (29Wang H. Chen X. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1380-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Importantly, roles for the two known degradative pathways, ERAD and re-uptake, have not been reported in these circumstances. In the current study, we focused on the mechanism of action of Ω-3 fatty acids. Consumption of these molecules has been associated with a lipid-lowering effect in vivo (30Harris W.S. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 785-807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reductions in heart disease (31Singh R.B. Niaz M.A. Sharma J.P. Kumar R. Rastogi V. Moshiri M. Cardiovasc.

Med. 1999; 130: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Two specific Ω-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6), have been shown to stimulate the degradation of newly synthesized apoB by cultured rat hepatocytes and hepatoma (McArdle RH-7777; McA) cells (29Wang H. Chen X. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1380-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33Wang H. Yao Z. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18514-18520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two properties of Ω-3 fatty acids suggest that they might act by enhancing re-uptake: Ω-3 fatty acids stimulate LDL receptor expression (34Ventura M.A. Woollett L.A. Spady D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which can enhance re-uptake (15Williams K.J. Brocia R.W. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16741-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and experiments with McA hepatoma clones that express a range of truncated human apoB cDNA constructs have shown that degradation induced by Ω-3 fatty acids is more pronounced for the most buoyant lipoproteins (29Wang H. Chen X. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1380-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which would experience the greatest diffusional impediments and contain the most apoE, a potential ligand for re-uptake via both LDL receptors and HSPGs. Therefore, we now examined four items: the target for Ω-3-stimulated degradation, focusing on early versus more assembled lipoprotein particles; the role of ERAD, focusing on a possible role for MTP inhibition and the participation of proteasomes; the role of re-uptake, focusing on LDL receptors, cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and lysosomes; and the intracellular localization and signaling involved in Ω-3-stimulated degradation. Based on these characteristics, our current studies indicate that Ω-3 fatty acids stimulate the degradation of newly synthesized apoB through a novel, third pathway that is distinct from either ERAD or re-uptake. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Ace Animals, Boyertown, PA) weighing 200–225 g were used to obtain hepatocytes by a protocol approved by the institutional animal care committee. All reagents, unless otherwise specified, were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). [14C]Eicosapentaenoic acid, [35S]methionine, and [14C]triolein, and ENHANCE solution were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA); [14C]oleic acid and 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]oleoyl phosphatidyl choline (POPC) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Arlington Heights, IL). Immunoprecipitin (staph A cells) was purchased from Bethesda Research Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). Collagenase was purchased from Worthington Biochemical (Freehold, NJ). Rat hepatoma (McArdle RH-7777) and human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells were purchased from American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA). Rabbit polyclonal antisera to rat apoB or apoE and mouse monoclonal antibody to rat apoB were developed in the authors' laboratories and were previously described (29Wang H. Chen X. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1380-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 35Sparks J.D. Bolognino M. Trax P.A. Sparks C.E.

Rats fed ad libitum were sacrificed in the morning, and liver cells were isolated by collagenase perfusion using 0.225 mg of collagenase/ml dissolved in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 1.66 mm calcium. Hepatocytes were purified by differential centrifugation through a 45% Percoll solution, and their viability was determined by exclusion of ethidium bromide stain, using a fluorescence microscope to visualize the stained nuclei of damaged cells. Only preparations with >90% intact cells were used. Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml on 60-mm culture dishes (previously coated with poly-d-lysine) in modified M199 medium (M199, 1% fetal bovine serum, 1 mmnicotinamide, 0.1 nm insulin, 3 mg/ml choline, 1.1%l-glutamine, 1% BSA). After a 4-h attachment period, the medium was changed (modified M199 identical to the above except BSA was omitted and the concentration of fetal bovine serum was raised to 10%). The next morning, cells were washed in serum-free medium three times, the experimental media were added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4–6 h. The experimental medium consisted of serum-free RPMI containing the appropriate isotopes (see below) and fatty acids present at a final concentration of 0.8 mm complexed to BSA (fatty acid:BSA molar ratio = 5:1). The fatty acids used were oleic (OA), EPA, and DHA. Control medium was identical, except that BSA (0.16 mm) without fatty acids was present. For metabolic labeling of proteins, [35S]methionine (70 µCi/ml) was included in the experimental media. As indicated under “Results,” in some experiments, McA hepatoma or HepG2 cells, maintained as in previous studies (15Williams K.J. Brocia R.W. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16741-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wang H. Yao Z. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18514-18520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were substituted for the rat primary hepatocytes. Following the 4- to 6-h incubation period, the cell monolayer was washed, then solubilized in 0.1 m NaOH, and the cell protein was determined by the Lowry method (37Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each 60-mm dish contained ∼1–1.5 mg of cell protein. The secreted apoproteins were isolated from the medium either by ultracentrifugation or immunoprecipitation. To isolate the d < 1.006 (VLDL) and 1.006 <d < 1.063 (IDL and LDL) g/ml density classes by centrifugation, sequential 20-h runs at 48,000 rpm in a 50Ti Beckman rotor at 4 °C were performed. After the first run atd = 1.006, the upper VLDL layer was harvested and the density of the infranatant adjusted to 1.066 g/ml with solid KBr. After being overlaid with a KBr solution of density 1.063, the adjusted infranatant was recentrifuged as before to isolate the IDL and LDL fractions. In some experiments, the HDL fraction (1.063 <d < 1.21) was isolated by sequential density centrifugation. Lipoprotein fractions were then dialyzed against 0.9% NaCl containing 10 mm unlabeled methionine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mmEDTA. Dialyzed lipoproteins were delipidated using 9 volumes of 100% isopropanol. Apoproteins were then collected by centrifugation in a Sorval HB-4 rotor at 10,000 rpm and 4 °C for 20 min and dissolved in buffer (0.01 m phosphate, pH 7, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol) in preparation for electrophoresis. To immunoprecipitate apoB or apoE from unfractionated conditioned medium, monospecific rabbit antiserum to rat apoB or apoE was used. Briefly, an aliquot of the medium was mixed with an equal volume of diluted antiserum (1:100 in PBS and 1% BSA) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Staph A was added in the form of Immunoprecipitin, and the resultant precipitate containing the immune complexes was washed extensively, the staph A cells were removed, and the isolated apoprotein was dissolved in gel sample buffer (0.0625 mTris/Cl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS). Electrophoretic separation of apo-VLDL, apo-IDL/LDL, and immunoprecipitates was accomplished using 3.5% acrylamide-18% glycerol gels as described previously (38Maguire G.F. Lee M. Connelly P.W. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 757-761PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot of each sample was taken for scintillation counting, so that total radioactivity applied to each lane could be determined. Also, protein size standards were included in each gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained, fixed, soaked in ENHANCE Fluor solution, and dried following protocols supplied by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Dried gels were then exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C, and signals on the resulting fluorograms were typically quantified by densitometry. Using the total radioactivity applied to each lane of the gel and the relative signal intensity of each band in that lane, we calculated the radioactivity associated with each apoprotein species. In some cases, gel bands were excised and the incorporated radioactivity was measured directly by scintillation counting. As a control, the incorporation of [35S]methionine into total cellular and secreted proteins was measured by trichloroacetic acid-phosphotungstic acid precipitation, as previously described (29Wang H. Chen X. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1380-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine the differential effects of MTP inhibition on the secretion of labeled apoB and apoE, in some experiments, McArdle RH-7777 cells were pretreated for 30 min with MTP inhibitor BMS-200150 (10 µm dissolved in Me2SO; (39Jamil H. Gordon D.A. Eustice D.C. Brooks C.M. Dickson Jr., J.K. Chen Y. Ricci B. Chu C.-H. Harrity T.W. Ciosek Jr., C.P. Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11991-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)) or Me2SO alone (final concentration 0.5%) before adding radiolabel. The cells were further incubated for 4 h, and the conditioned media contents of apoB and apoE were determined by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis as described above. To determine the effects of inhibiting PI3K on apoB secretion, rat primary hepatocytes were pretreated for 30 min with 1 µmwortmannin (dissolved in Me2SO) or Me2SO alone (final concentration 0.5%), which were maintained throughout the experiment. BSA, or BSA complexed with DHA or OA, was then added, and the cells were further incubated for 5 h. The total apoB contents of the conditioned media samples were determined by radioimmunoassay (35Sparks J.D. Bolognino M. Trax P.A. Sparks C.E. Atherosclerosis. 1986; 61: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In some experiments, [35S]methionine was used to pulse label apoB. The effect of wortmannin on labeled apoB recovery from cell lysate and conditioned medium at the 15- and 90-min time points of the chase period was determined by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis (29Wang H. Chen X. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1380-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine whether the proteasome mediated Ω-3 fatty acid-induced apoB degradation, McA hepatoma cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in [35S]methionine-containing medium supplemented with either BSA or EPA·BSA complexes in the absence or presence of the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (10 µm; purchased from the laboratory of Dr. E. J. Corey, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). Samples of cell lysates and conditioned media were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-apoB antiserum, followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. To determine whether Ω-3 fatty acids targeted apoB to lysosomal degradation, a similar experiment was performed substituting ammonium chloride (40 mm) for lactacystin. At this concentration of ammonium chloride, there was no evidence of cell toxicity as assessed by trichloroacetic acid-phosphotungstic acid precipitation analysis, but there was >80% inhibition of the degradation of exogenously added 125I-LDL (gift of Dr. Ira Tabas, Columbia University, New York, NY). To evaluate whether there were differential effects of fish oil fatty acids and OA on the re-uptake of newly synthesized VLDL, we employed an experimental design identical to that described above, except heparin (0.1 or 10 mg/ml) was added to the treatment media to block LDL receptor-dependent and proteoglycan-mediated re-uptake (18Williams K.J. Fless G.M. Petrie K.A. Snyder M.L. Brocia R.W. Swenson T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13284-13292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control experiments were performed showing that the flotation properties of VLDL were unchanged in the presence of heparin. Three methods were used to assess possible effects of Ω-3 fatty acids on cellular MTP function. First, rat primary hepatocytes were incubated with BSA, OA, or EPA, and then MTP activity in cell lysates was measured using a fluorescent assay (Roar Biomedical, New York, NY). Second, to determine if lipid classes synthesized in the presence of OA or Ω-3 fatty acid are equivalent substrates for MTP, primary rat hepatocytes or HepG2 cells were incubated with tritiated OA or EPA, total cellular lipids were extracted into isopropanol, and biosynthetically labeled cholesteryl ester, triglyceride, and phospholipids were separated by preparative thin layer chromatography. Each of these isolated lipids was incorporated into vesicles that were used as donors in a transfer reaction with acceptor vesicles and 50 µg of purified bovine MTP, as described previously (40Jamil H. Dickson Jr., J.K. Chu C.H. Lago M.W. Rinehart J.K. Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6549-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As an internal control for lipid transfer, each donor vesicle also contained [14C]triolein. Third, to determine if Ω-3 lipids inhibit MTP-mediated transfer of non-Ω-3 lipids, artificial donor vesicles were prepared containing either labeled triolein or labeled POPC. The majority of lipid mass in these vesicles was unlabeled phosphatidylcholine that contained either 100% oleate esterified at the sn-2 position (control), or a mixture of 70% oleate and 30% DHA or 30% EPA. Transfer of the labeled lipids to acceptor vesicles in the presence of 50 µg of purified bovine MTP was measured as described previously (40Jamil H. Dickson Jr., J.K. Chu C.H. Lago M.W. Rinehart J.K. Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6549-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Rat primary hepatocytes were isolated as above, allowed to recover overnight, and then incubated for 4 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with [35S]methionine (300 µCi/ml), 0.16 mm BSA, and either no fatty acids, 0.8 mm OA, or 0.8 mm DHA. The monolayers were washed three times, and the cell lysates and post-nuclear supernatants were prepared as described (41Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lysates were mixed with sucrose to a final concentration of 8.58% then placed onto discontinuous sucrose gradients. The density layers were 56% sucrose (0.46 ml), 50% (0.92 ml), 45% (1.38 ml), 40% (2.3 ml), 35% (2.3 ml), 30% (1.38 ml), 20% (0.46 ml), and 8.58% (2.3 ml of the post-nuclear supernatant). After ultracentrifugation (SW41 rotor, 4 °C, 39,000 rpm, 18 h), 23 fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected from the top of the tube. From each of the top 22 fractions, 420 µl was subjected to immunoprecipitation/SDS-PAGE analysis using rabbit anti-rat apoB antiserum, followed by fluorography then densitometric quantification; 4 µl was used to assay the Golgi marker enzyme α-mannosidase II (42Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar); 11 µl was used for Western blot analysis of the ER membrane protein calnexin (using an antibody from Calbiochem) followed by densitometric quantification by densitometry. Results are displayed as mean ± S.E., n ≥ 3. Absent error bars in the figures indicate S.E. values smaller than the drawn symbols. For comparisons between a single experimental group and a control, the unpaired, two-tailed t test was used. For comparisons involving several groups simultaneously, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was initially used. When the ANOVA indicated differences among the groups, pairwise comparisons of each experimental groupversus the control group were performed using the Dunnettq′ statistic. Analyses were performed with PRISM (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Previous studies using McA hepatoma cell clones that express a range of artificially truncated human apoB constructs have suggested that buoyant lipoproteins, regardless of the precise length of the transfected apoB construct, are the most susceptible to degradation induced by Ω-3 fatty acids (29Wang H. Chen X. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1380-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33Wang H. Yao Z. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18514-18520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now used two approaches to test this suggestion with native, rather than artificially truncated, forms of apoB. First, we studied rat primary hepatocytes, a non-transformed cell that secretes apoB100almost exclusively in the form of VLDL, while dividing its production of apoB48 between particles with the density of VLDL (∼2/3 of secreted apoB48) and HDL (∼1/3 of secreted apoB48) (43Hussain M.M. Zanni E.E. Kelly M. Zannis V.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, this pattern of apoB48secretion allows us to compare the effect of Ω-3 fatty acids on particles with different buoyant densities but containing the same naturally occurring form of apoB. Rat primary hepatocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h with OA or DHA complexed to BSA (or BSA alone, data not shown) in the presence of [35S]methionine, and the conditioned media were separated into VLDL and HDL fractions by density gradient ultracentrifugation. The content of labeled apoB48 in each density fraction was then quantified. As shown in Fig.1, the recovery of labeled apoB48 from the VLDL fraction of conditioned media from cells treated with DHA averaged only ∼35% (p < 0.001) compared with the results with samples from the OA group, whereas the recovery of labeled apoB48 from the HDL fraction was essentially independent of treatment. Thus, a single type of apoB, apoB48, was differentially affected by DHA depending entirely on the density of the associated lipoprotein. As expected, apoB100 secretion by these cells, which is essentially entirely limited to the VLDL fraction, was strongly (∼70%) inhibited by the addition of Ω-3 fatty acids (data not shown). To pursue the implication that the apoB sequence per se is not a determinant of Ω-3 fatty acid-induced degradation, we turned to a different cell culture model, the human hepatocarcinoma HepG2, which produces apoB100 but no apoB48 whatsoever.

https://openalex.org/W2026848616,"cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) can modulate synaptic transmission by acting directly on unknown targets in the neurotransmitter secretory machinery. Here we identify Snapin, a protein of relative molecular mass 15,000 that is implicated in neurotransmission by binding to SNAP-25, as a possible target. Deletion mutation and site-directed mutagenetic experiments pinpoint the phosphorylation site to serine 50. PKA-phosphorylation of Snapin significantly increases its binding to synaptosomal-associated protein-25 (SNAP-25). Mutation of Snapin serine 50 to aspartic acid (S50D) mimics this effect of PKA phosphorylation and enhances the association of synaptotagmin with the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex. Furthermore, treatment of rat hippocampal slices with nonhydrolysable cAMP analogue induces in vivo phosphorylation of Snapin and enhances the interaction of both Snapin and synaptotagmin with the SNARE complex. In adrenal chromaffin cells, overexpression of the Snapin S50D mutant leads to an increase in the number of release-competent vesicles. Our results indicate that Snapin may be a PKA target for modulating transmitter release through the cAMP-dependent signal-transduction pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1518911851,"Using a novel flow chamber assay system and whole blood, we show that leukocytes from septic individuals have a four-fold elevation of adhesion, but not rolling, on a P-selectin/beta2-integrin substrate. Most leukocytes from septic patients (but not healthy controls) that bound vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) were neutrophils. All adhesion was inhibited with an antibody specific for the VCAM-1 ligand alpha4-integrin. The alpha4-integrin was present on neutrophils from septic patients but not on neutrophils from patients with localized bacterial infections. The plasma milieu of septic patients was sufficient to induce neutrophils from healthy subjects to bind VCAM-1 under flow conditions. This is the first description of alpha4-integrin/VCAM-1 pathway of neutrophil recruitment in human disease. This pathway may provide a new therapeutic target to reduce inappropriate neutrophil adhesion without altering the normal yet critical beta2-integrin-mediated adhesive function of neutrophils."

Using an ABRA mutant that lacksN-glycosidase activity as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system, a 30-kDa antioxidant protein-1 (AOP-1) was found to be an ABRA(E164Q)-interacting protein. The interaction was further confirmedin vitro by a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay. The colocalization of endogenous AOP-1 and exogenous ABR proteins in the cell was demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence.

Moreover, ROS scavengersN-acetylcysteine and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl delayed programmed cell death. This indicates that ROS are important mediators of ABR-induced apoptosis. When ectopically expressed, AOP-1 blocked the release of cytochrome c and prevented apoptosis in ABR-treated cells. These findings suggest that the binding of ABRA to AOP-1 promotes apoptosis by inhibiting the mitochondrial antioxidant protein AOP-1, resulting in the increase of intracellular ROS and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, which activates caspase-9 and caspase-3.

Besides the inhibition of protein synthesis, it is an attractive hypothesis that ABRA adopts alternative molecular mechanisms to trigger apoptotic programs. Apoptosis is a form of cell death that leads to elimination of excess or damaged cells. Apoptosis contributes to tissue homeostasis and embryonic development (8Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). A range of stimuli including DNA damage, growth factor withdrawal, anticancer drugs, and members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family of death receptors can induce apoptotic signals (9Parrizas M.

Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In most cases, the apoptotic cascade is initiated by loss of integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane accompanied by release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space of mitochondria to cytosol. The cytosolic cytochrome c serves as a cofactor with the apoptotic protease activating factor (Apaf-I) to activate pro-caspase 9 (13Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

Caspase-9 then activates other caspases, which undermine the structural integrity of the cells by cleaving a key structural protein substrate (16Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). The signaling events that affect the particular apoptotic mediators are currently a focus of intense study. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) participate in a wide variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (17Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol.

Elucidation of the mechanism that is involved in ABR-triggered apoptosis is important for the development of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. In order to identify ABRA-interacting proteins, the yeast two-hybrid system was used. Since ABRA inhibits the growth of yeast cells by its N-glycosidase activity, ABRA(E164Q) with a mutation of its N-glycosidase catalytic site was employed. In this paper, we report on an ABRA(E164Q)-interacting protein, AOP-1, which is an antioxidant protein with two catalytic conserved cysteine residues and has 93.3% identity to SP-22 (24Tsuji K. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Obinata M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a mitochondria antioxidant protein. We show that ABRA can directly inhibit the antioxidant activity of AOP-1 in vitro and two antioxidantsN-acetylcysteine (NAC) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (4-OH-tempo) can delay ABR-induced apoptosis, suggesting that ABR may deplete cellular antioxidants. Moreover, the ectopic expression of AOP-1 prevents both mitochondrial cytochrome c release and phenotypic apoptosis in response to ABR. Taken together, our results support AOP-1 as one of the target molecules of ABRA-induced apoptosis. A Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 2 kit was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA).

Chicken anti-DYKDDDK (flag) polyclonal antibody, high fluorescent FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody, and rhodamine-conjugated rabbit anti chicken antibody were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). HeLa cells and 293 T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Since wild type ABRA is detrimental to yeast, mutant ABRA(E164Q) cDNA was fused to pAS2–1 vector to screen a Jurkat cDNA library cloned in the pGAD10 vector. A total of 1.2 × 106 clones were analyzed, and the transformed yeast was selected on synthetic dropout agar plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine in the presence of 50 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma). Twenty-four colonies that developed color on filter paper were restreaked on selective plates to allow plasmid segregation and tested again for β-galactosidase activity. For quantitative data, the liquid culture assay usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate was performed, and the hydrolysis of the substrate was measured at A 420. Two clones were specific for ABRA(E164Q). Nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNA inserts was performed using a PE Applied Biosystems automated sequencer. GST-ABRA(E164Q) fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose as described (25Chen J.K. Hung C.H. Liaw Y.C. Lin J.Y. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In vitro translated 35S-labeled AOP-1 was prepared by using pBluescript-AOP-1 as a template with an RNA production system-T7 and rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system as described by the supplier with modifications. The translation reaction contained 2 mm GTP and 2 mm MgCl2 in addition to the original formula. For the binding assay, BSA-washed glutathione-agarose beads were bound to GST-ABRA(E164Q) or GST in buffer containing 10 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm DTT, and 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed six times with the same buffer. After the GST- or GST-ABRA(E164Q)-bound beads were incubated with 35S-labeled AOP-1 (50 μl of in vitrotranslated product) for 2 h at 4 °C, the reaction products were extensively washed with the same buffer and extracted with SDS sample buffer. The extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and exposed to Kodak x-ray film. A 768-base pair cDNA containing the entire coding region of AOP-1 and a flag tag at its C terminus was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, and the plasmid purification was prepared using a Qiagen Maxi Kit (Groningen, Netherlands). HeLa cells were transfected with the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-AOP-1 using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The LipofectAMINE-DNA complexes were left on the cells for 5 h, and then the transfection mixtures were removed and replaced with normal growth medium to grow for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and the pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors (Complete Mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 250 mm sucrose. The cells were homogenized by 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells, and the supernatant was re-centrifuged at 8,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the crude mitochondria fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was referred to as the cytosolic fraction. Samples containing 40 μg of protein were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-cytochromec monoclonal antibody 7H8.2C12 at a dilution of 1:1,000, anti-flag M5 antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000, and anti-α tubulin antibody at a dilution of 1:2,000 in the buffer followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3-AOP-1 as described previously. Apoptosis was induced by ABR treatment. The reaction was terminated by washing the culture cells three times with PBS, followed by fixation in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 12 min. The fixed cells were washed three times in PBS, followed by permeabilization in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. The cells were then blocked for 30 min in blocking buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 and 10% FBS in PBS), followed by a 1-h incubation with mouse monoclonal antibody against cytochrome c (6H2.B4) at a dilution of 1:1,000 and chicken polyclonal antibody against DYKDDDK(flag) at a dilution of 1:500. The cells were washed four times at 10 min each in blocking buffer followed by a 1-h incubation with a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody for cytochrome c and a rhodamine-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken antibody for flag. After extensive washing, slides were mounted and examined under a Zeiss Axipophot inverted microscope with a 100× oil objective lens. To assess colocalization of AOP-1 with ABR in HeLa cells, uptake experiments with ABR and immunofluorescence for detecting endogenous AOP-1 were performed. Cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing 10 μg/ml FITC-ABR for 30 min at 4 °C and then warmed at 37 °C for 45 min. The treated cells were placed back on ice, rinsed with 0.1 m galactose to remove surface-bound FITC-ABR, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for AOP-1 using rabbit polyclonal antibody and a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. Samples were imaged on a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP2), with a 100× oil objective lens. Apoptotic cell death was examined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-catalyzed deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP)-nick end labeling (TUNEL) method as described by the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples (104events) were analyzed with a Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur, and the distribution of cells was determined. To assess DNA ladder formation, HeLa cells (1 × 106) were treated with various concentrations of ABR for 24 h at 37 °C. The DNA were digested overnight at 37 °C in 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K and 0.5% sarcosyl in PBS, treated with 10 μg of RNase A for 1 h at 37 °C, then gently extracted with phenol and chloroform, and analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel. The viability of cells was assessed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cells were preincubated with NAC or 4-OH-tempo for 2 h ,followed by treatment with 5 ng/ml ABR for 15 h. The medium was replaced by 500 μl of MTT solution (1 mg/ml in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS) and further incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The well was then washed three times with PBS, and ethanol was added to the well. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Levels of intracellular ROS were measured as described (26Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szeida P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, HeLa cells (1 × 106/ml) were treated with 100 ng/ml ABR for various periods of time and they were incubated with 10 μm DCFH-DA in the dark for 30 min before the cells were harvested. The cells were washed with PBS and analyzed (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 515–540 nm) on a Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur. The primers, 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGGCACCTGCTGTCACCCAGCATGCA-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCTACTGATTTACCTTCTGAAA-3′, were designed to PCR amplify a 585-base pair fragment from pGAD10-AOP-1. The amplified DNA fragment encoding the amino acids 62–256 of AOP-1 was subcloned in-frame to the NdeI/BamHI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET-15b. The expression plasmid was transformed into bacteria BL21(DE3) pLysS, and the recombinant AOP-1 (re-AOP-1) was purified as described by the supplier. The thiol-specific antioxidant activity of AOP-1 was measured by the method described by Kim et al. (27Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Assays were performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 0.5 unit of glutamine synthetase, 10 mm DTT, 12 μm FeCl3, 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), with re-AOP-1 (0.06 mg/ml) and various amounts of ABRA(E164Q) and were incubated at 30 °C. At various time periods, aliquots (10 μl) were removed to assay the residual glutamine synthetase activity. The CaspACE™ assay system was used according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, cytosol extracts (50 μg) were incubated with 245 μl of reaction buffer containing 80 μl of caspase buffer, 5 μl of Me2SO, and 10 mm DTT for 30 min at 30 °C and then Ac-DEVD-AMC or Ac-LEHD-AFC was added at a final concentration of 50 μm. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. Cleavage of fluorogenic substrate was quantitated by using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-4500, Hitachi) at 360/460 nm or 400/505 nm. To identify proteins interacting with ABRA, a yeast two-hybrid system was employed. Two clones that specifically interacted with ABRA(E164Q) were confirmed by a colony-lift β-galactosidase filter assay and were quantified by a liquid culture assay (Table I). Sequencing of these cDNA clones identified two major transcripts, which consisted of an open reading frame encoding 256 amino acids (Fig.1). Computer analysis using NCBI/BLASTN (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70747) Google Scholar) revealed that the open reading frame was identical to human protein AOP-1 (24Tsuji K. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Obinata M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Data base searches revealed that AOP-1 shared 93.3% identity with SP-22, a bovine mitochondrial thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase, and the N-terminal sequence contained the basic features of mitochondrial targeting signal (29Araki M. Nanri H. Ejima K. Murasato Y. Fujiware T. Nakashima Y. Ikeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2271-2278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The mitochondria targeting signal was composed of 20–60 amino acid residues with abundant positive charges, no negative charges, and frequent hydroxylated residues, and they were rich in hydrophobic residues (30Hartl F.U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 31Schatz G. Dovverstein B.

The sequence upstream of the cleavage site was coincident with the specificity of two processing peptidases for mitochondrial proteins. The amino acid sequences RX↓(F/L/I)XX(T/S/G)XXXX↓ were cleaved sequentially in two steps by mitochondrial processing peptidase and mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (33Nett J.H. Schagger H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8652-8658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The data showed a high probability that AOP-1 was localized in the mitochondria.Table ITwo-hybrid interaction assay between ABRA and AOP-1 constructsProtein fused to GAL4 domainβ-Galactosidase units1-aβ-Galactosidase units were measured as described by Miller (51).LacZ phenotypeDNA bindingActivatingmean ± S.D.pVA3 1-bThe plasmids pVA3 and pTD1–1 contain murine p53 and SV40 large T-antigen, respectively, which interact strongly and serve as a positive control.pTD1–11-bThe plasmids pVA3 and pTD1–1 contain murine p53 and SV40 large T-antigen, respectively, which interact strongly and serve as a positive control.20.8 ± 1.5BluepAS2–1-ABRA(E164Q)None0.1 ± 0.01WhiteNonepGAD10-AOP-10.1 ± 0.01WhitepAS2–1-ABRA(E164Q)pGAD10-AOP-17.8 ± 1.4BlueYeast strain Y190 was transformed with various combinations of plasmids and β-galactosidase units were determined by the liquid culture assay.1-a β-Galactosidase units were measured as described by Miller (51Miller J.H.

Open table in a new tab Yeast strain Y190 was transformed with various combinations of plasmids and β-galactosidase units were determined by the liquid culture assay. To confirm that AOP-1 did indeed bind to ABRA(E164Q), human AOP-1 was transcribed and translated in vitro. We used GST-ABRA(E164Q) linked to glutathione-Sepharose beads to examine the interactions between ABRA(E164Q) and AOP-1. After incubation with35S-labeled AOP-1, these GST-ABRA(E164Q) beads (or the control bait, GST beads) were pelleted and washed extensively. The proteins which remained bound tightly to GST or to GST-ABRA(E164Q) were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The 35S-labeled AOP-1 was visualized by autoradiography. The AOP-1 protein was bound specifically by the GST-ABRA(E164Q) (Fig. 2). Taken together, these data suggest that AOP-1 is an ABRA(E164Q)-interacting protein. To determine whether AOP-1 localizes in the mitochondria as SP-22 does, we examined the localization of AOP-1 within the cells and compared it with the distribution of α-tubulin. We constructed a plasmid clone pcDNA3-AOP-1 that was designed to express AOP-1 with a flag tag at the C-terminal end (AOP-1-flag). This plasmid DNA was transfected into HeLa cells, and the distribution of AOP-1-flag was detected by subcellular fractionation and Western blotting. As shown in Fig.3 A, the subcellular localization of AOP-1-flag was found in the mitochondria, and this indicated that AOP-1 was distinctly separated fromα-tubulin. To further confirm the mitochondrial localization of AOP-1, immunofluorescence staining was carried out by using an anti-cytochromec antibody (a well characterized mitochondria marker). In HeLa cells, the anti-cytochrome c antibody gave a punctate staining pattern characteristic of mitochondrial localization and the AOP-1-flag colocalized with cytochrome c (Fig.3 B). The same results were obtained by rabbit anti-AOP-1 polyclonal antibody to detect endogenous AOP-1 (data not shown). We conclude that AOP-1 localizes in the mitochondria. The ability of AOP-1 and ABR to associate in vivo would indicate a possible role for this interaction in ABR-induced apoptosis. We studied the intracellular localization of AOP-1 and ABR by confocal microscopy of HeLa cells, which were treated with FITC-conjugated ABR and stained for endogenous AOP-1. In Fig. 4, green fluorescence indicated the endocytotic FITC-ABR (left panel) and red fluorescence showed the mitochondrial punctate staining of AOP-1 (center panel). As shown in theright panel, there was colocalization of AOP-1 and ABR in yellow (white arrows). The data suggest that ABR interacts with AOP-1 in vivo. The typical laddering pattern of fragmented DNA associated with apoptosis appeared after exposure of cells to 100 ng/ml ABR (Fig.5 A). The nuclei of HeLa cells treated with ABR and then stained with Hoechst 33258 showed that chromatin condensation was produced in apoptotic cells (data not shown). These results are consistent with previous studies (34Hughes J.N. Lindsay C.D. Griffiths G.D. Hum. Exp. Toxicol. 1996; 15: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and show that abrin is able to trigger programmed cell death. To determine whether the level of ROS in ABR-treated cells was increased, we used FACS analysis with DCFH-DA, which is a nonpolar compound that readily diffuses into cells and is hydrolyzed to DCFH by esterase. When DCFH is oxidized within the cell, it becomes a highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein. The fluorescence of untreated HeLa cells represented the endogenous ROS, and 300 μmH2O2 treatment was used as a positive control (Fig. 5 B). The intracellular ROS was increased 2-fold at 4 h after ABR treatment. The results suggest that the level of ROS is increased at the early phase in ABR-treated cells. Since increases of ROS generation in ABR-treated cells are the early sign of the ABR toxicity, it is suggested that ROS are important mediators of ABR-induced cell death. To test whether ROS levels play a role in mediating the death signal of ABR, two antioxidants NAC and 4-OH-tempo, which is known to be localized into the mitochondria, were used, and the results showed that the antioxidants inhibited ABR-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 C). These data further demonstrate that the generation of ROS plays an important role in the induction of apoptosis by ABR. To further examine whether ROS are important mediators of ABR-induced cell death, we tested the effects of re-ABRA(E164Q) on the antioxidant activity of recombinant AOP-1 in vitro. The antioxidant activity of re-AOP-1 was detected by monitoring the ability of the protein to inhibit the inactivation of glutamine synthetase using a DTT/Fe3+/O2 metal-catalyzed oxidation system (27Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various amounts of ABRA(E164Q) were added to the reaction mixture, and the protection value of AOP-1 (0.06 mg/ml) was decreased from 81% protection (AOP-1 alone) to 32% (molar ratio: AOP-1:ABRA(E164Q) = 1:2; Fig. 6). The inhibitory effects of ABRA(E164Q) on AOP-1 antioxidant activity were dose-dependent. The results indicate that ABRA(E164Q) not only specifically interacts with AOP-1, but also directly inhibits the antioxidant activity of AOP-1, which may elevate the level of ROS, f"

The tE2 forms a 60-subunit core with the morphology of a pentagonal dodecahedron and consists of 20 cone-shaped trimers interconnected by 30 bridges. Frozen-hydrated and stained molecules of tE2 in the same field vary in size ∼20%. Analyses of the data show that the size distribution is bell-shaped, and there is an approximately 40-Å difference in the diameter of the smallest and largest structures that corresponds to ∼14 Å of variation in the length of the bridge between interconnected trimers. Companion studies of mature E2 show that the complex of the intact subunit exhibits a similar size variation. The x-ray structure of Bacillus stearothermophilus tE2 shows that there is an ∼10-Å gap between adjacent trimers and that the trimers are interconnected by the potentially flexible C-terminal ends of two adjacent subunits. We propose that this springlike feature is involved in a thermally driven expansion and contraction of the core and, since it appears to be a common feature in the phylogeny of pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes, protein dynamics is an integral component of the function of these multienzyme complexes.

Analyses of the data show that the size distribution is bell-shaped, and there is an approximately 40-Å difference in the diameter of the smallest and largest structures that corresponds to ∼14 Å of variation in the length of the bridge between interconnected trimers. Companion studies of mature E2 show that the complex of the intact subunit exhibits a similar size variation. The x-ray structure of Bacillus stearothermophilus tE2 shows that there is an ∼10-Å gap between adjacent trimers and that the trimers are interconnected by the potentially flexible C-terminal ends of two adjacent subunits. We propose that this springlike feature is involved in a thermally driven expansion and contraction of the core and, since it appears to be a common feature in the phylogeny of pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes, protein dynamics is an integral component of the function of these multienzyme complexes. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pyruvate dehydrogenase dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase truncated dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase mature E2 electron microscopy binding protein The pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes (PDCs)1 are among the largest (M r ∼106 to 107) and most complex multienzyme structures known. A central feature of these complexes is a 24-mer (Escherichia coli) or 60-mer (eukaryotes and some Gram-positive bacteria) dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) core with the morphologies of a cube or a pentagonal dodecahedron, respectively (1Reed L.J.

The cores have both functional and structural roles in organizing the multienzyme complex; the E2 activity is associated with the scaffold to which the other components are attached. These include the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), which requires a binding protein (BP) to anchor it to the core of the yeast and mammalian PDCs, although, in E. coli and Bacillus stearothermophilus PDCs, BP is not required (1Reed L.J.

The trimers are interconnected by bridges to form an empty cage-like complex with the tip of the trimer directed toward the center of the structure. Examination of the 4-Å resolution crystal structures of dodecahedral truncated E2 (tE2) cores fromEnterococcus faecalis and B. stearothermophilusand the 2-Å resolution crystal structure of a cubic tE2core from Azotobacter vinelandii show that an anchor residue in the C terminus of the 2-fold related trimers resides in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the adjacent subunits (8Izard T. Aevarsson A. Allen M.D. Westphal A.H. Perham R.N. de Kok A. Hol W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1240-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Two such “ball-and-socket” joints on the 2-fold axis maintain the connections between adjacent trimers. It was proposed that the different spatial arrangements of the trimers in the cubic and pentagonal dodecahedron cores are the result of small differences in the nature and position of these interface residues (8Izard T. Aevarsson A. Allen M.D. Westphal A.H. Perham R.N. de Kok A. Hol W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1240-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our three-dimensional electron microscopy studies of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae tE2 and mature E2 (mE2) reveal flexibility in the arrangement of the E2 cores that is extraordinary for a macromolecular protein complex. Cryoelectron microscopy affords a snapshot of the molecular composition of the preparation at room temperature in the absence of constraints imposed by a crystal lattice with a shutter speed of ∼10−5 s (12Dubochet J. Adrian M. Chang J.J. Homo J.C. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Schultz P. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1988; 21: 129-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar), i.e. the time required to reduce the temperature of the specimen from room temperature to approximately −170 °C, at which point molecular motion is frozen. The tE2 and mE2 molecules exhibit ∼20% size variability with a bell-shaped distribution that is related to conformational changes in the trimers and the bridges that connect adjacent trimers. Remarkably, the flexibility of tE2 core is also documented by stain electron microscopy. We propose that the expansion/contraction phenomenon is thermally driven and is related to a rotationally flexible ball and socket that forms the bridgelike contacts between adjacent trimers. A cantilever-like feature containing a proline residue may serve to augment and transmit the flexibility of an upstream loop to the ball-and-socket connection of the bridge. Sixty of these springlike features, two at each of the 30 bridges, are a common motif of the dodecahedral cores of B. stearothermophilus, E. faecalis, and presumably S. cerevisiae and the human pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes. The “breathing” of the core structures affects the disposition of the bound constituents and may be an important component of the function of these multienzyme complexes by promoting the shuttling of the intermediates of catalysis associated with the lipoamide arm to the numerous reaction centers and by augmenting the catalysis through the movement of amino acid residues at the catalytic sites. The S. cerevisiaetE2 subunit, comprising either residues 206–454 or 181–454, was overexpressed in E. coli, and the assembled cores were purified to near homogeneity as described (13Maeng C.Y. Yazdi M.A. Niu X.D. Lee H.Y. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13801-13807Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Maeng C.-Y. Yazdi M.A. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5879-5882Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The expression vector for mE2 was pYE2 m-32TX. The protein has 44 extra amino acid residues at the N terminus, including a His6 tag and an enterokinase cleavage site. 2J. E. Lawson, D. B. McCarthy, and L. J. Reed, unpublished results. Both tE2and mE2 exhibited catalytic activity (acetyl transfer from [1-14C]acetyl-CoA to dihydrolipoamide) similar to wild-type E2. The tE2 preparation was diluted to 25 μg/ml in 0.25% methylamine tungstate stain containing 10 μg/ml bacitracin and immediately sprayed onto Butvar 76 film with a carbon backing to minimize shrinkage and to obtain randomly oriented molecules (15Kolodziej S.J.

Electron Microsc. Technol. 1991; 18: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Application of the specimen to the Butvar film alone resulted in molecules that were smaller than their frozen-hydrated counterpart (10Stoops J.K. Baker T.S. Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Niu X.D. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their application to a carbon film gave molecules primarily oriented with their pentagonal face bound to the carbon film and, consequently, were not useful for image processing. The images of the stained molecules were recorded at 0.2–0.4 μm under focus at a nominal magnification of × 50,000 under conventional irradiation procedures using a JEOL JEM 1200 electron microscope operated at 100 kV. For cryoelectron microscopy, 3 μl of the tE2 and mE2 preparations at 0.1 and 0.4 mg/ml, respectively, were deposited, blotted, and quick-frozen in liquid ethane on a glow-discharged carbon-coated holey grid. The vitrified specimens were recorded at ∼2–4 μm under focus with a dose of ∼9 e−/Å2 at × 50,000 magnification. Micrographs were digitized with a Zeiss SCAI microdensitometer (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Englewood, CO) using a step size of 2.8 Å/pixel at the specimen scale. All data processing steps were carried out on SGI Octane dual processor workstations (Silicon Graphics, Inc.). First, individual tE2 and mE2 particles were boxed out manually using an x-window-based program Emtool (17Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). Subsequently, data processing steps included particle size variation determination and three-dimensional reconstruction of particles in various size groups, using our programs based on the principles of Fourier common lines (18Crowther R.A. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1971; 261: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Fuller S.D. Butcher S.J. Cheng R.H. Baker T.S. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The orientation determination and three-dimensional reconstruction were carried out using parallel programs for refinement (20Zhou Z.H. Chiu W. Haskell K. Spears H.J. Jakana J. Rixon F.J. Scott L.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 576-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and reconstruction (21Johnson O. Govindan V. Park Y. Zhou Z.H. Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on High Performance Computing. IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA1997: 517-521Google Scholar) (see below), which are based on Fourier common lines (18Crowther R.A. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1971; 261: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Fuller S.D. Butcher S.J. Cheng R.H. Baker T.S. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and Fourier-Bessel synthesis (22Crowther R.A. DeRosier D.J. Klug A. Proc. R. Soc. London. 1970; 317: 319-340Crossref Google Scholar), respectively. A list of 28 initial orientation estimates was generated for each particle image using a program based on self common lines. A preliminary three-dimensional model was then computed at a nominal resolution of 35 Å from 10 particles that showed the best self common line phase residuals and had been refined by cross common line phase-residual minimization among all 10 particles (20Zhou Z.H. Chiu W. Haskell K. Spears H.J. Jakana J. Rixon F.J. Scott L.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 576-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The particles with incorrect orientations were eliminated from the initial list of orientation estimates by evaluating the cross common line phase residual between the particle and projection images of the preliminary model. The selected orientations were then refined, first by a global refinement that minimized the cross common line phase residuals across all selected particles (20Zhou Z.H. Chiu W. Haskell K. Spears H.J. Jakana J. Rixon F.J. Scott L.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 576-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and then by a projection-based refinement that optimized the match between the image and the projections computed from a preliminary three-dimensional model. The new model reconstructed from these refinements was used as a template for the next round of particle selection and refinement, resulting in a further improved model. This process was iterated for two cycles utilizing the entire data set until no more particles with correct orientation parameters could be obtained and no improvement was evident in the cross common line phase residual between particle images and the computed projections. The final reconstruction was calculated by merging data to 25-Å resolution (for tE2) or 30-Å resolution (for mE2) from particle images with defocus values around 2–3 μm, which were determined from the incoherently averaged Fourier transforms of particle images in each micrograph (23Zhou Z.H. Hardt S. Wang B. Sherman M.B. Jakana J. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The final reconstructions were corrected for the contrast transfer function of the microscope (24Zhou Z.H. Chen D.H. Jakana J. Rixon F.J. Chiu W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3210-3218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have developed procedures to analyze the size variability of the molecules. The relative size of the tE2 and mE2 molecules were determined using the program sizeDiff (David Zuckerman and Z. H. Zhou), which is a Unix and Windows NT/2000 program written in C++ based on Fourier common lines. SizeDiff uses an iterative method that minimizes the Fourier cross common line phase residuals between the particle images and a model template derived from the data set as described below. After the orientation and center parameters of each particle were determined and the structure was refined to ∼30-Å resolution (see above), a preliminary three-dimensional reconstruction was calculated by combining all of the refined particles with a phase residual of less than 40°. Approximately 10–15% of the particles were eliminated in this step, and these were visually investigated in order to avoid discarding those particles that may have greater phase residual values because of a large size variation. However, the subset of discarded particles was found to be of poor quality. This “average” reconstruction was then used as the template for the first round of size determination. Initially, 20 projection images were generated at regularly spaced orientation intervals, and these were used as the template set. Each particle image was then isotropically scaled to best match the template projection by minimizing the averaged cross common line phase residual between the particle and the corresponding projection. The isotropic scaling does not accurately reflect the size variation of the single particle images, because the size variability of the molecule is not isotropic (see “Results”) and, consequently, may introduce errors in their alignment, especially when the size difference between the model and the image is large. For example, after obtaining the structure representative of the 1.0 size groups, it was used as a model after scaling for the 0.95 and 1.05 size groups, and these structures were finally used as models after scaling to align the 0.9 and 1.10 size groups, respectively. This bootstrap approach was required for the appropriate alignment of smallest and largest images. Subsequently, the models obtained from the alignment were refined as described below. Further classification of the particles and the refinement of the reconstruction were accomplished by utilizing the particles ± 1% of the designated size. After repeating a second cycle of size variation analysis using sizeDiff, ∼80% of the particles remained in this 2% size bin. After eliminating outliers, the remaining particles were merged to generate a reconstruction to be used as the template in a third cycle of analysis. Over 96% of the particles were in this 2% size bin, thus demonstrating the convergence of the data set and that the final reconstruction had optimal resolution. The convergence of the data set and the optimization of the resolution support the validity and utility of our method of size variation analysis. In contrast to these results, the application of sizeDiff to the rice dwarf virus images (25Lu G.Y. Zhou Z.H. Baker M. Jakana J. Cai D.Y. Wei X.C. Chen S.X. Gu X.C. Chiu W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8541-8549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that over 99% of the particles were within a 1% size group, indicating that the size variability of the E2core is not an artifact of the methods described above. The size variation of the frozen hydrated tE2 molecules was also analyzed by the polar Fourier transform method (26Baker T.S. Cheng R.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 27Cheng R.H. Kuhn R.J. Olson N.H. Rossmann M.G. Choi H.-K. Smith T.J. Baker T.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), and the size distribution was similar to that shown in Fig. 1 (data not shown). The three-dimensional visualization was carried out using the Iris Explorer (NAG, Inc., Downers Grove, IL) with custom designed modules (28Dougherty M.T. Chiu W. Bailey G.W. Alexander K.B. Jerome W.G. Bond M.G. McCarthy J.J. Microscopy and Microanalysis 1998. Springer, Atlanta1998: 452-453Google Scholar). The maps were displayed at the same threshold using a contour level of ∼1ς (S.D.) above the mean density of the map unless otherwise indicated. The radial density distribution profile was obtained by spherically averaging the three-dimensional density map. The atomic coordinates of the crystal structure of the dodecahedral form of B. stearothermophilus tE2 (PDB identification number1B5S) were initially provided by Izard et al. (8Izard T. Aevarsson A. Allen M.D. Westphal A.H. Perham R.N. de Kok A. Hol W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1240-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The areas of interest of the structure were either rendered and exported to Open Inventor format using Ribbons (29Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 958-961Crossref Scopus (784) Google Scholar) or directly converted to electron density map using a Gaussian filter to a resolution similar to the EM structures (25 Å) (30Zhou Z.H. High Resolution Three-dimensional Electron Cryomicroscopy and Reconstruction of Herpes Simplex Virus Capsids Ph.D. thesis. Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX1995Google Scholar) for further three-dimensional comparisons using Iris Explorer (28Dougherty M.T. Chiu W. Bailey G.W. Alexander K.B. Jerome W.G. Bond M.G. McCarthy J.J. Microscopy and Microanalysis 1998. Springer, Atlanta1998: 452-453Google Scholar). This study reveals an ∼20% size variation of the tE2 images (Fig.1). This extraordinary size variation of a macromolecular complex raised considerable skepticism concerning the significance of these data and their interpretation. Indeed, our original observation of a size variation of tE2 and its subcomplexes was ascribed to magnification variations of the electron microscope, and consequently, only those particles with sizes that were within 3% of the average were used in the reconstructions (11Stoops J.K. Cheng R.H. Yazdi M.A. Maeng C.-Y. Schroeter J.P. Klueppelberg U. Kolodziej S.J. Baker T.S. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5757-5764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As a result, the structures of tE2, tE2.tBP, tE2.BP, and tE2.BP.E3 were representative of 10–15% of the data sets (11Stoops J.K. Cheng R.H. Yazdi M.A. Maeng C.-Y. Schroeter J.P. Klueppelberg U. Kolodziej S.J. Baker T.S. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5757-5764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Below, we examine and discount three trivial possibilities for the size variation, which, if not discounted, could muddle the interpretation of the findings of this study. Electron microscopy studies of icosahedral virus capsids reveal a maximum variation of ∼1% in their sizes in a given field. This variation in size was attributed to electron microscope magnification variation, although the possibility that this size variability was related to the molecules was not ruled out (31Aldroubi A. Trus B.L. Unser M. Booy F.P. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In any event, a 20% size distribution of the images in the same field recorded in stain (10Stoops J.K. Baker T.S. Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Niu X.D. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and vitreous ice (10Stoops J.K. Baker T.S. Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Niu X.D. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) in the present study is well outside the range of variation normally attributed to an electron microscope. Moreover, during the recording period of this study, numerous other macromolecular images were recorded without any noticeable size disparity. Therefore, we conclude that the large size variability of these images is not related to the electron microscope. A more plausible explanation for the size difference is that these flexible (“soft”) particles may be easily squashed to a variable degree between the two air-water interfaces in vitreous ice or that the particles may collapse in the stain. We have ruled out both possibilities. A tilt experiment of the stained molecules shows that they interconvert upon tilting the stage 32° (10Stoops J.K. Baker T.S. Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Niu X.D. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, a round particle with a larger profile that was not imbedded in stain was found to have an oval shape upon tilting the stage, demonstrating that the tilt experiment is a sensitive method of detecting molecules that are not spherical (10Stoops J.K. Baker T.S. Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Niu X.D. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a tilt experiment employing vitreous ice did not reveal any particles that were flattened (Fig. 2). Furthermore, analysis of the size distribution of the particles in the same field showed that the small and larger particles are co-mingled and are not segregated (10Stoops J.K. Baker T.S. Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Niu X.D. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, since a size increase due to flattening of the particle would severely disrupt the icosahedral symmetry of the molecule, the reconstruction representative of the largest particles should have the poorest resolution or not be amenable to the icosahedral reconstruction methods. In this regard, a sensitive gauge of the accuracy of the alignment of the particle images to their template is obtained by a comparison of the phase residual values. The average phase residuals for the 0.90, 0.95, 1.0, 1.05, and 1.1 size groups of the stain data (Fig. 1) are 19.8°, 17.1°, 18.0°, 18.7°, and 19.7°, respectively. This exceptionally narrow range and their low numerical values are strong evidence that the icosahedral symmetry of the molecules selected for the reconstructions has been well preserved over the 0.9–1.1 size variation. Moreover, the resolution values ∼20–25 Å are comparable for all reconstructions, and most significantly, the larger reconstruction agrees very well with the comparable x-ray structure of B. stearothermophilus tE2 filtered to the resolution of the electron microscope structure (see below). The electron microscope fields show that there are a significant number of particles that lack the full complement of 20 trimers in stain and ice (see Ref. 10Stoops J.K. Baker T.S. Schroeter J.P. Kolodziej S.J. Niu X.D. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24769-24775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig.2 C). The E2 components of the α-keto acid dehydrogenase family of multienzyme complexes are known to form tightly associated trimers that are held together by weaker connections to form the cagelike scaffold (7Mattevi A.

In this regard, the truncated E2 of the dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase from E. coli is normally a 24-mer, but it formed stable trimers when expressed with a C-terminal His6 tag and failed to associate further (32Knapp J.E. Carroll D. Lawson J.E. Ernst S.R. Reed L.J. Hackert M.L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These broken and/or incompletely formed cages are probably related to the tenuous connections between trimers, and the incomplete structures are lacking, to a variable extent, some of the trimer building blocks. Although we can readily visualize fragments of the core (Fig. 2 C) and avoid these images in the reconstruction, structures that lack a small number of trimers may not be possible to discern. Hence, it is possible that the size variation of the images is related to incomplete molecules with variable number of trimers. In this scenario, only the images near the 1.1 size classification are representative of complete structures, and consequently, over 90% of the data set consists of molecules with variable trimer content (incomplete structures, Fig. 1). A priori, these incomplete cages may be expected to have the same radius of curvature and thus the same size of the complete structure, since the nature of the interaction bet"

(1995) Anal. Biochem.226, 139–146). Twenty-five major N-glycan structures, all of them hitherto unknown, were identified as pyridylamino derivatives. Of these, 13 were neutral, 10 were monosialyl, and 2 were disialyl oligosaccharides. All N-glycans contain from one to four Galα(1,4)Galβ(1,4) sequences at the nonreducing terminal positions and are devoid of fucose residues. N-Acetylneuraminic acids were α(2,6)-linked only to β-galactose. The HPLC profiles of theN-glycans from four different glycoproteins were qualitatively very similar to each other, but not identical in the peak distributions. Monosialyl glycans were most abundant in all four glycoproteins, followed by neutral glycans. Disialyl glycans were lowest in ovotransferrin, and highest in ovomucoid. Triantennary structures with bisecting GlcNAc were predominant in ovotransferrin, and tetra-antennary (with and without bisecting GlcNAc-containing) structures were predominant in other glycoproteins. Penta-antennary structures (with a sialic acid and without bisecting GlcNAc residue) were also found in small quantities in all four glycoproteins. In contrast to the chicken egg white counterparts, which contain mostly high mannose and hybrid types, all N-glycan structures in the major pigeon egg white glycoproteins are complex type. N-Glycans from major glycoproteins of pigeon egg white (ovotransferrin, ovomucoid, and ovalbumins) were enzymatically released and were reductively aminated with 2-aminopyridine, separated, and structurally characterized by mass spectrometry and a three-dimensional mapping technique using three different columns of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Takahashi, N., Nakagawa, H., Fujikawa, K., Kawamura, Y., and Tomiya, N.

In view of these unique structural features, we felt that detailed structural studies were in order, not only to understand the underlying evolutionary significance but to be better able to utilize these unique features for biomedical applications. We have undertaken such studies, employing the powerful methodology of the three-dimensional mapping (9Tomiya N. Awaya J. Kurono M. Endo S. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal.

We have elucidated the fine structures of the major oligosaccharide of ovotransferrin, ovomucoid, and ovalbumins from pigeon egg white, the results of which are reported here. In all, 25 different structures were identified, all of which were hitherto unknown structures. Glycoamidase A (also known as glycopeptidase A) from sweet almond (13Takahashi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 76: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), β-galactosidase, and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase from jack bean were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). α-Galactosidase from coffee bean was purchased from Oxford GlycoSciences, Inc., (Bedford, MA). Sialidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens was obtained from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Pronase were from Sigma. Pigeon eggs were collected from local racing pigeon breeders in the Minneapolis-St. Paul (MN) metropolitan areas. Both egg white and egg yolk (separated manually) were lyophilized and kept at 4 °C until use. Lyophilized pigeon egg white (200 mg) was dissolved with 1.5 ml of distilled water and centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. Supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane, and samples of typically ∼20 mg of protein were injected on a 21.2 × 250-mm Jupiter RP-HPLC C4 columns (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The mobile phases were (A) 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and (B) 90% CH3CN in H2O containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The elution (8 ml/min) was by a linear gradient of 10–70% of B in A developed over 30 min, followed by isocratic elution for 10 min. Proteins eluted were detected by A280 nm. Individual peaks were collected, dialyzed against water in the cold, and then lyophilized. The pyridylamino (PA)-derivatives of isomalto-oligosaccharides (4–20 glucose residues) and of referenceN-glycans (code nos. 300.8 and 400.16) 2For all the structures of the PA-oligosaccharides and their code numbers so far accumulated, please refer to the FCCA (Forum Carbohydrates Coming of Age) web site. Whenever coordinates are cited in this paper, they are always listed in the order of GU(ODS), GU(amide). were from Seikagaku Kogyo. The following N-glycans were prepared by the known methods (11Takahashi N. Nakagawa H. Fujikawa K. Kawamura Y. Tomiya N. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar): triantennary with bisectingN-acetylglucosamine residue (code no. 301.8) and the one of the monosialyl 301.8 (code no. 1A1-301.8) were from nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo californica (14Shoji H. Takahashi N. Nomoto H. Ishikawa M. Shimada I. Arata Y. Hayashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A tetra-antennary oligosaccharide with bisectingN-acetylglucosamine (code no. 401.16) and the one of the monosialyl 401.16 (code no. 1A4-401.16) were prepared from peanut agglutinin receptor isolated from human gastric cancer cells (15Shimoda N. Muramatsu H. Osawa T. Yamada T. Adachi M. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1987; 102: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One of the monosialyl triantennary structures (code no. 1A1-300.8) was prepared from fetuin trisialyl triantennary (code no. 3A3-300.8), by elimination of two of the sialic acid residues with specific α(2,3)-sialidase digestion. One of the monosialyl tetra-antennary structures (code no. 1A4-400.16) was selectively prepared from a neutral tetra-antennary compound (code no. 400.16), using a bovine colostrum α(2,6)-sialyltransferase (16Joziasse D.H.

R denotes Manβ4glcNAcβ4GlcNAc. PA-oligosaccharides from pigeon ovotransferrin (POT), ovomucoid (POM), ovalbumin (high) (POA(hi)), and ovalbumin (low) (POA(lo)) were prepared as described (11Takahashi N. Nakagawa H. Fujikawa K. Kawamura Y. Tomiya N. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). POT (10 mg), POM (1 mg), POA(hi) (2 mg), and POA(lo) (2 mg), each of which corresponds to ∼130 nmol of N-glycans, were used as starting materials. All experimental procedures used in this work, including chromatographic conditions, have been detailed previously (10Nakagawa H. Kawamura Y. Kato K. Shimada I. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Takahashi N. Nakagawa H. Fujikawa K. Kawamura Y. Tomiya N. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, each glycoprotein was proteolyzed with chymotrypsin and trypsin mixture, and the proteolysate was further digested with glycoamidase A to releaseN-glycans. After removing the peptidic materials, the reducing ends of N-glycans were derivatized with 2-aminopyridine (17Yamamoto S. Hase S. Fukuda S. Sano O. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 105: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The mixture of PA-oligosaccharides was separated by HPLC on a diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) column according to the sialic acid content. Each separated fraction was then applied to an octadecylsilica (ODS) HPLC column, and the elution time of each peak was recorded in glucose units (GU) and plotted on the x axis. Then, each of the separated N-glycans was applied to the amide-silica column to separate on the basis of size. Each peak's elution time was recorded in GU and plotted on the y axis. The elution times of a given compound from these two columns (ODS and amide-silica) provide a unique set of coordinates, and the coordinates of the unknown PA-glycan on the two-dimensional map were compared with those of the authentic reference compounds. The GU of all unknown N-glycans were first compared with those of the reference N-glycans on the two-dimensional map (containing more than 400 referenceN-glycans). Identification of a sample PA-glycan was confirmed by co-chromatography with a suitable referenceN-glycan on the ODS and amide-silica columns. For further confirmation, the sample PA-glycan and the reference compound were digested in parallel with one or more exo-glycosidases. At each step of the trimming, the elution positions of the resultant PA-glycans from each were examined for the identity with the expected reference PA-glycan. The trimming and comparison was continued until the products from the sample and the original reference compound became totally coincidental with a known PA-oligosaccharide (trimannosyl core). Each PA-glycan (50 pmol) isolated on the ODS and amide-silica columns was digested by exoglycosidases (α-sialidase from A. ureafaciens, β-galactosidase and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase from jack bean under conditions described previously (10Nakagawa H. Kawamura Y. Kato K. Shimada I. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Takahashi N. Tomiya N. Takahashi N. Muramatsu T. Handbook of Endoglycosidases and Glycoamidase. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 209-241Google Scholar). α-Galactosidase from coffee bean (20 milliunits) was used in 15 μl of 0.1 mcitrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 37 °C for 15 h. PA-oligosaccharides were permethylated using the NaOH/dimethyl sulfoxide slurry method as described by Dell et al. (19Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). FAB-MS analyses were performed on an Autospec orthogonal acceleration-time of flight mass spectrometer (Micromass), fitted with a magnet bypass flight tube, and interchangeable FAB source assemblies. For FAB-mass spectrometry experiments, the fitted cesium ion gun was operated at 26 kV and the source accelerating voltage at 8 kV. The permethyl derivatives of the N-glycans were redissolved in CH3OH for loading onto the probe tip coated with glycerol:m-nitrobenzylalcohol:trifluoroacetic acid (50:50:1, v/v/v) as matrix. For ESI-mass spectrometry, the accelerating voltage was maintained at 4 kV, which allowed magnet scanning above the mass range of m/z 5000. Hall probe calibration was used. The permethyl derivatives were dissolved in CH3OH, and 10-μl aliquots were injected through a Rheodyne loop into the mobile phase (methanol:water:acetic acid, 50:50:1, v/v/v), delivered at a flow rate of 5 μl/min into the ESI source by a syringe pump. For GC-electron impact (EI)-mass spectrometry linkage analysis, partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared from the permethyl derivatives by hydrolysis (2 mtrifluoroacetic acid, 121 °C, 2 h), reduction (10 mg/ml NaBH4, 25 °C, 2 h), and acetylation (acetic anhydride, 100 °C, 1 h). GC-EI-mass spectrometry was carried out using a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph connected to a Hewlett-Packard 5973 mass selective detector. Sample was dissolved in hexane prior to splitless injection into a HP-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, inner diameter; Hewlett-Packard). The column head pressure was maintained at around 8.2 p.s.i. to give a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min using helium as carrier gas. Initial oven temperature was held at 60 °C for 1 min, increased to 90 °C in 1 min, and then to 290 °C in 25 min. More than 90% of the total carbohydrate was released from each PEW glycoprotein by the sequential digestion of PEW with trypsin/chymotrypsin followed by glycoamidase A, as determined by the orcinol-H2SO4 reaction (20Francois C. Marshall R.D. Meuberger A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1962; 257: 335-341Google Scholar) (data not shown). For mass spectrometric analysis (see Fig. S1 of the Supplemental Material, available on-line), a part of the N-glycan mixture was desialylated before PA-derivatization. To rapidly evaluate the glycosylation difference among the four PEW glycoproteins, a total mass spectrometry profile was obtained for each of the permethyl derivatives of the desialylated PA-oligosaccharide pools (Fig. S1 of the Supplemental Material). From the molecular ion signals detected, as well as the common fragment ions afforded at m/z 260 (HexNAc+), 464 (Hex-HexNAc+), and 668 (Hex-Hex-HexNAc+) in low mass range (data not shown), it could be concluded that all PEW glycans are similarly heterogeneous, differing mainly in the relative ratio of each of the complex type N-glycans identified (TableI). The absence of prominent fragment ions between m/z 1000 and 2000 (data not shown) suggests that the trimannosyl core is mainly extended by ±Gal-(Gal-GlcNAc) antenna without significant amount of LacNAc repeats. This was further supported by the linkage analysis data, which showed that all four PEW glycan pools gave similar partially methylated alditol acetate peaks but differ in relative amounts (see Fig. S2 of the Supplemental Material). Terminal Gal, 4-linked Gal, and 4-linked GlcNAc were the three most prominent peaks detected, followed by 2,4-linked Man and terminal GlcNAc. These most prominent peaks corroborated the assignment of Gal-4Gal-4GlcNAc and Gal-4GlcNAc as the predominant termini. The identification of 2,4-linked Man indicated that most species were at least triantennary, whereby the upper 6-arm could be non-branched (2-linked Man), 2,6-branched, or 2,4,6-branched. In support of this, POM showed the highest amount of 2,4,6-linked Man. Conversely, 2-linked Man was most abundant in POT and low in POM and POA(hi). It was also relatively more abundant in POA(lo) than POA(hi). This is consistent with the distribution of the molecular ion profiles observed (Fig. S1). In addition, the relative ratio of 3,4,6-linked Man:3,6-linked Man was the highest in POT, suggesting that POT has the highest proportion of bisecting GlcNAc, which was nevertheless present in all PEW glycans. No 2-Gal, 3-Gal, and 6-Gal was detected from the desialylated samples of PEW-glycoproteins, suggesting that the linkage of Gal-Gal is only Gal1–4Gal.Table IAssignment of the [M + H]+ molecular ions afforded by the permethyl derivatives of desialylated PA-oligosaccharides from PEW[M + H]+Assignment, based on a common trimannosyl chitobiose core1-aAll components listed could be detected in each of the PEW PA-oligosaccharide pools but differed in relative amounts. Most could be further assigned as tri-, tetra-, or pentaantennary structures based on the number of GlcNAc residues contained. However, the presence of bisecting GlcNAc should also be taken into consideration. The maximum number of GlcNAc residue in addition to the two of the chitobiose core is 5, which suggests that a pentaantennary structure in general does not also carry a bisecting GlcNAc.Correspondence to structures in Tables III and IV1-bNot all PA-oligosaccharides could be identified by the 2-D map method, probably due to the limited quantities.2386Core + Hex2HexNAc32427Core + Hex1HexNAc42590Core + Hex3HexNAc32631Core + Hex2HexNAc42794Core + Hex4HexNAc32835Core + Hex3HexNAc4MS-Va − SA,1-c“−SA” denotes loss of NeuAc.

Open table in a new tab In summary, FAB-mass spectrometry and GC-EI-mass spectrometry analysis of the permethylated derivatives of the desialylated PA-taggedN-glycans from PEW yielded the following conclusions. 1) Gal(1,4)Gal(1,4)GlcNAc is the predominant terminal structure, and there were no Gal(1,2)Gal, Gal(1,3)Gal, or Gal(1,6)Gal linkages. This is in total agreement with the results independently obtained in the preceding paper (5Suzuki N. Khoo K.-H. Chen H.C. Johnson J.R. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23221-23229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 2) The trimannosyl core was mainly extended by ±Gal-(Gal-GlcNAc) antenna without significant amount of LacNAc repeats. 3) Extensive heterogeneity is largely a consequence of different permutation of the number of antennae, absence or presence of bisecting GlcNAc, and different location and degree of sialylation. Gal-GlcNAc termini could be due to incomplete capping with either sialylation or α-galactosylation, or, in the case of the desialylated samples, removal of the terminal sialic acids (Fig. S1). It is obvious that detailed characterization of all glycan chains present is not possible without great effort. We therefore chose to employ a facile two-dimensional HPLC mapping method to secure a comparative glycosylation profiles of the four PEW and homing in only on those more abundant and/or characteristic peaks of common occurrence thus purified. The total mass spectrometry data profile was used as a starting reference point to interpret the HPLC mapping data and, in general, agrees well with the final conclusion drawn, apart from a few peaks that were not further identified and characterized by subsequent HPLC mapping (see Table I). Separation of PA-oligosaccharides by DEAE-5PW column (first HPLC) yielded neutral, monosialyl, and disialyl oligosaccharide fractions (for example, Fig. S3 for the N-glycans from POT). All ionic charges in the PEW are attributable to α-sialic acids, since all acidic fractions changed to neutral species afterArthrobacter α-sialidase digestion. The PA-glycan fractions separated on DEAE-5PW column were applied to the ODS column, using exactly the same chromatographic conditions for neutral, monosialyl, and disialyl N-glycans from the POT, POM, and POAs (Fig. 1). Molar ratios (calculated from their peak areas) of the neutral, monosialyl, and disialyl fractions were, respectively, 40.8, 52.7, and 6.4% for POT; 25.4, 55.1, and 19.5% for POM; 36.5, 49.8, and 13.7% for POA(hi); and 28.4, 61.3, and 10.3% for POA(lo). As shown in Fig. 1, theN-glycan profiles released from the four different PEW glycoproteins were qualitatively similar but not quantitatively identical. Each PA-labeled fraction from the ODS column was further fractionated by the molecular size using the amide-silica column. On the amide-silica column, the neutral fraction N-IX was separated into N-IXa and -IXb, and the N-X, into N-Xa and -Xb. MS-I was separated into MS-Ia and -Ib; MS-III, into MS-IIIa and -IIIb; and MS-V, into MS-Va, -Vb, and -Vc. Fig. S4 of the Supplemental Material shows an example of separation profiles of the neutral fraction N-IX and monosialyl fraction MS-V from POT. Other ODS fractions appeared as single peaks on amide-silica column. Since the branches of the predominant N-glycans from PEW terminate in the sequence of Galα(1,4)Galβ(1,4), and this sequence was reported only once previously to be present inN-glycan (2François-Gérard C. Pierce-Cretel A. André A. Dorland L. van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Montreuil J. Spik G. Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Glycoconjugates.in: Chester M.A. Heinegard D. Lundblad A. Svensson S. Rahms, Lund, Sweden1983: 169-170Google Scholar), most, if not all, of the N-glycans in the PEW glycoproteins must have novel or unusual structures. Indeed, a total of 25 N-glycans were isolated and identified unambiguously (Table III) or tentatively (Table IV). The coordinate sets of these compounds do not match, by direct comparison, with any of the reference compounds available on the two-dimensional map accumulated prior to our studies (data not shown).Table IIIPA-glycans obtained from POT, POM, POA(hi), and POA(lo) with unambiguous structuresR denotes Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc.Table IVProposed structures of PA-glycans from POT, POM, POA(hi), and POA(lo) deduced via UC valuesTable IVProposed structures of PA-glycans from POT, POM, POA(hi), and POA(lo) deduced via UC valuesR denotes Manβ4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc.

As shown in Fig. 2, after α-galactosidase digestion, N-I and N-VI changed into the known tetra-antennary structures, 400.16 and 401.16, respectively. The number of α-galactose residues released was calculated from their GU (amide) before and after α-galactosidase digestion (12.9 versus9.8 and 13.0 versus 9.9). On the average, GU(amide) of ∼0.8 corresponds to one galactose residue (12Tomiya N. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Consequently, we could assign 4 α-galactose residues being attached to the 4 β-galactoses in 400.16 and 401.16, respectively. The structures of N-I and N-VI were thus established (Table III). Assignment of singly and/or doubly charged molecular ions afforded by ESI-mass spectrometry analysis of the permethylated PA-glycans (ESI-mass spectrometry) further confirmed this. The measured molecular mass of permethylated N-I changed from 3855.8 (Hex11HexNAc6-PA) to 3039.6 (Hex7HexNAc6-PA) after α-galactosidase digestion. The difference of 816.2 corresponds to 4 mol of galactose residues. Likewise, the measured molecular mass of permethylated N-VI changed from 4101.2 (Hex11HexNAc7-PA) to 3284.7 (Hex7HexNAc7-PA) upon α-galactosidase digestion, indicating the difference of 816.9 corresponds to 4 mol of galactose residues. Similarly, after α-galactosidase digestion, N-III and N-IXb released 3 mol of galactose residues, accompanied by the changes in GU(amide), 2.5 and 2.4, to become the known triantennary reference compounds, 300.8 and 301.8, respectively. In this case also, we could unambiguously assign 3 α-galactose residues to be on the 3 β-galactoses on the respective reference compounds, and the structures of N-III and N-IXb were thus elucidated. The molecular mass of permethylated N-IXb was 3447.9 (Hex9HexNAc6-PA) as determined by mass spectrometry analysis.

W3A1) electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) and the αR237A mutant were determined by anaerobic redox titration. The FAD reduction potential of the oxidized-semiquinone couple in wild-type ETF (E′1) is +153 ± 2 mV, indicating exceptional stabilization of the flavin anionic semiquinone species. Conversion to the dihydroquinone is incomplete (E′2 < −250 mV), because of the presence of both kinetic and thermodynamic blocks on full reduction of the FAD. A structural model of ETF (Chohan, K. K., Scrutton, N. S., and Sutcliffe, M. J. (1998) Protein Pept. Lett. 5, 231–236) suggests that the guanidinium group of Arg-237, which is located over the si face of the flavin isoalloxazine ring, plays a key role in the exceptional stabilization of the anionic semiquinone in wild-type ETF. The major effect of exchanging αArg-237 for Ala in M. methylotrophus ETF is to engineer a remarkable ∼200-mV destabilization of the flavin anionic semiquinone (E′2 = −31 ± 2 mV, andE′1 = −43 ± 2 mV). In addition, reduction to the FAD dihydroquinone in αR237A ETF is relatively facile, indicating that the kinetic block seen in wild-type ETF is substantially removed in the αR237A ETF. Thus, kinetic (as well as thermodynamic) considerations are important in populating the redox forms of the protein-bound flavin. Additionally, we show that electron transfer from trimethylamine dehydrogenase to αR237A ETF is severely compromised, because of impaired assembly of the electron transfer complex.

Additionally, we show that electron transfer from trimethylamine dehydrogenase to αR237A ETF is severely compromised, because of impaired assembly of the electron transfer complex. electron-transferring flavoprotein trimethylamine dehydrogenase Electron-transferring flavoproteins (ETFs)1 act as carriers of electrons in bacteria and mitochondria. They mediate electron transfer between degradative enzymes and membrane-bound electron acceptors (1Thorpe C. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar). ETFs have been classified into two functional groups (2Weidenhaupt M. Rossi P. Beck C. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 169-178PubMed Google Scholar). Housekeeping ETFs function in the oxidation of fatty acids and some amino acids and have been isolated from mammalian and bacterial sources (1Thorpe C. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar, 3Husain M. Steenkamp D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 709-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specialized ETFs are restricted to prokaryotes and are synthesized under defined nutritional conditions. Specialized ETFs are involved in the oxidation of trimethylamine (4Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and carnitine (5Eichler K. Buchet A. Bourgis F. Kleber H.P. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. J.

Microbiol. 1995; 146: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and are also important in nitrogen fixation (7Earl C.D. Ronson C.W. Ausubel F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). All ETFs possess one equivalent of non-covalently bound FAD per ETF heterodimer, except the ETF from Megasphaera elsdenii, which contains 2 equivalents of FAD per dimer (8Whitfield C.D. Mayhew S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2801-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that AMP (1 equivalent) is associated with the housekeeping ETFs from pigs (9Sato K. Nishina Y. Shiga K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 114: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), humans (10Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and Paracoccus denitrificans (11Roberts D.L. Salazar D. Fulmer J.P. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and with the specialized ETF from Methylophilus methylotrophus(12Duplessis E.R. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. Thorpe C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 32: 195-199PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian and bacterial ETF proteins act as one-electron carriers, cycling between the oxidized and anionic flavin semiquinone forms. The ETF from M. elsdenii is unusual in acting physiologically as a two-electron carrier. ETF from mammalian sources and P. denitrificans can be reduced to the dihydroquinone form, by reduction with dithionite or by photoreduction (13Gorelick R.J. Mizzer J.P. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6936-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Husain M. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Watmough N.J. Kiss J. Frerman F.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although reduction to the two-electron level is relatively slow.M. methylotrophus ETF is readily converted to the semiquinone form in reactions with its physiological electron donor, trimethylamine dehydrogenase (TMADH) (4Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or during artificial reduction with dithionite (16Davidson V.L. Husain M. Neher J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 812-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, further reduction to the dihydroquinone is not observed with dithionite (16Davidson V.L. Husain M. Neher J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 812-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with catalytic amounts of TMADH (4Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of M. methylotrophus ETF to the dihydroquinone form can be achieved (albeit sluggishly) by electrochemical methods (17Byron C.M. Stankovich M.T. Husain M. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8582-8587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, when ETF is in complex with TMADH, the FAD is more readily reduced to the two-electron level (18Jang M.-H. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 12546-12552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this latter case, further reduction to the dihydroquinone is likely to be a consequence of a large scale structural reorganization in ETF that accompanies complex assembly with TMADH (18Jang M.-H. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 12546-12552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Chohan K.K. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Pept.

The midpoint reduction potentials of the E′1(quinone-semiquinone) and E′2(semiquinone-dihydroquinone) couples of the FAD in M. methylotrophus ETF have been determined. The potential of the quinone-semiquinone couple is exceptionally high (+196 mV (17Byron C.M. Stankovich M.T. Husain M. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8582-8587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and +141 mV (21Wilson E.K. Huang L. Sutcliffe M.J. Mathews F.S. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) as determined by electrochemical and spectrophotometric methods, respectively), consistent with a need to accept electrons from the 4Fe-4S center of TMADH (midpoint potential, +102 mV (22Barber M.J. Pollock V. Spence J.T. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). The potential of the semiquinone-dihydroquinone couple is more conventional (-197 mV; (17Byron C.M. Stankovich M.T. Husain M. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8582-8587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)), indicating that there is a substantial (and essentially complete) kinetic block on full reduction of ETF by dithionite (-530 mV) or photoexcited deazariboflavin (-650 mV). A similar, albeit less complete, kinetic block on reduction to the dihydroquinone has been reported for pig liver ETF; reduction to the dihydroquinone level in pig liver ETF requires about 1 h for equilibration (13Gorelick R.J. Mizzer J.P. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6936-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Husain M. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The potentials measured for free M. methylotrophus ETF (as with any ETF) may not of course reflect the situation in the electron transfer complex with its physiological electron donor (TMADH) but nevertheless are likely to serve as a reasonable guide. M. methylotrophus ETF shares considerable sequence identity with bacterial and mammalian ETFs (10Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Roberts D.L. Salazar D. Fulmer J.P. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Preliminary crystallographic studies of M. methylotrophus ETF have been reported (23White S.A. Mathews F.S. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but to date no crystallographic structure for the protein is available. However, crystallographic structures of human andP. denitrificans ETF have been determined at 2.1 Å (10Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and 2.6 Å (11Roberts D.L. Salazar D. Fulmer J.P. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) resolution, respectively. Using the x-ray structure of human ETF as a template (10Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.-J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we built a model of the structure ofM. methylotrophus ETF, in free solution and in complex with TMADH (19Chohan K.K. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1998; 5: 231-236Google Scholar). The model predicts that the two subunits (subunit α (residues 1–321) and subunit β (residues 322–585)) of M. methylotrophus ETF comprise three domains. Domain I (the N-terminal region of the α subunit), domain II (the C terminus of the α subunit and a small C-terminal region of the β subunit), and domain III (the majority of the β subunit) form a Y-shaped structure, with domains I and III forming a shallow “bowl” in which domain II rests. Domain II is connected to domains I and III by two flexible regions of polypeptide chain (19Chohan K.K. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1998; 5: 231-236Google Scholar). Small angle x-ray scattering studies have demonstrated that domain II is mobile with respect to domains I and III (20Jones M. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Gunter Grossmann J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The isoalloxazine ring of FAD interacts almost exclusively with domain II (Fig. 1). The model of M. methylotrophus ETF suggests that residue Arg-237 is located close to the FAD isoalloxazine ring, with its guanidinium group positioned over the si face of the dimethylbenzene subnucleus. The guanidinium group is thus located to help stabilize the increased electron density (which resides predominantly in the pyrimidine subnucleus) on reduction of the flavin to the anionic semiquinone. In this paper, we report the redox properties of a mutant ETF in which Arg-237 is replaced by Ala. We show that Arg-237 plays a key role in the exceptional stabilization of the anionic semiquinone in native ETF and that mutation of Arg-237 to Ala removes the kinetic block to full reduction of the FAD. These findings demonstrate that the chemical properties of a single residue close to the flavin isoalloxazine ring can have profound effects on the redox properties (thermodynamic and kinetic) of protein-bound flavin. Isolation of the αR237A mutant form of ETF was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit supplied by Stratagene and oligonucleotides 5′-CTT TGC TGC TCA GCT CCG ATT GCG GAT-3′ and 5′-ATC CGC AAT CGG AGC TGA GCA GCA AAG-3′. The ETF expression plasmid pED1 (20Jones M. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Gunter Grossmann J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was used as template DNA for the mutagenesis reaction. Recombinant wild-type ETF was expressed from plasmid pED1 in E. coli strain TG1 as described (20Jones M. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Gunter Grossmann J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To ensure that no spurious changes had arisen as a result of the mutagenesis reaction, the entire ETF gene was resequenced using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech T7 sequencing kit and protocols. Recombinant wild-type and mutant ETF proteins were expressed from plasmids pED1 and pED1R237A, respectively, in the E. colistrain TG1. Recombinant strains were grown at 20 °C in 2xYT medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. ETF was purified in large quantities (∼30 mg/liter of late exponential phase culture) from recombinant strains of E. coli. Harvested cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.2 mm EDTA) and broken in a French press (140 megapascals, 4 °C). The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 90 min, and solid ammonium sulfate was added to 50% saturation. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a high performance phenyl-Sepharose column using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with buffer A containing 1.5 m ammonium sulfate. After being washed with equilibration buffer, protein was eluted using a descending gradient (1.5 to 0 m) of ammonium sulfate. Fractions containing ETF were dialyzed exhaustively against buffer A and applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A. After washing with buffer A, protein was eluted using a gradient (0 to 2 m KCl); ETF was eluted at ∼0.5m KCl. Samples were dialyzed exhaustively against potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 and stored (-70 °C) in the presence of 20% ethylene glycol. Redox titrations were performed within a Belle Technology glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere (oxygen maintained at <5 ppm) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Anaerobic titration buffer was prepared by flushing freshly prepared buffer with oxygen-free nitrogen. Protein samples admitted to the glove box were deoxygenated by passing through a Bio-Rad 10DG column, with final dilution of the eluted protein to give an ETF concentration of 70–80 μm. Solutions of benzyl viologen, methyl viologen, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthaquinone, and phenazine methosulfate were added to a final concentration of 0.5 μm as redox mediators for the titrations. Absorption spectra (300–750 nm) were recorded on a Shimadzu 2101 UV-visible spectrophotometer, and the electrochemical potential was monitored using a CD 740 m combination pH/voltmeter coupled to a Russell platinum/calomel electrode. The electrode was calibrated using the Fe(II)/Fe(III)-EDTA couple (108 mV) as a standard. The flavoprotein solutions were titrated electrochemically using sodium dithionite as reductant and potassium ferricyanide as oxidant, as described by Dutton (24Dutton P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 422-435Google Scholar). After the addition of each aliquot of reductant, and allowing equilibration to occur (stabilization of the observed potential), the spectrum was recorded, and the potential was noted. The process was repeated at several (typically ∼40) different potentials. In this way, a set of spectra representing reductive and oxidative titrations was obtained. Small corrections were made for any drift in the base line by correcting the absorbance at 750 nm to zero, and spectrophotometric contributions from the mediators were removed prior to data analysis. The observed potentials were corrected to those for the standard hydrogen electrode (platinum/calomel + 244 mV). Data manipulation and analysis were performed using Origin software (Microcal). Absorbance values at wavelengths of 470 nm (near the oxidized flavin maximum) and 370 nm (close to the maximum for the anionic semiquinone) were plotted against potential. Data were fitted to Equation 1, which represents a two-electron redox process derived by extension to the Nernst equation and the Beer-Lambert law, as described previously (24Dutton P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 422-435Google Scholar, 25Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Turner K.L. Holt R.A. Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13816-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A=a10(E−E1′)/59+b+c10(E2′−E)/591+10(E−E1′)/59+10(E2′−E)/59Equation 1 In Equation 1, A is the total absorbance;a, b, and c are component absorbance values contributed by one flavin in the oxidized, semiquinone, and reduced states, respectively. E is the observed potential;E′1 and E′2 are the midpoint potentials for oxidized-semiquinone and semiquinone-reduced couples, respectively. In using Equation 1 to fit the absorbance-potential data, the variables were unconstrained, and regression analysis provided values in close agreement with those of the initial estimates. The αR237A mutant ETF was purified essentially as described for the wild-type protein. A notable difference between the mutant and wild-type proteins is the redox state of the flavin. αR237A ETF is purified in the oxidized form, whereas wild-type ETF is isolated as a mixture of oxidized and anionic flavin semiquinone forms (Fig. 2). Oxidation of the wild-type ETF with potassium ferricyanide, followed by immediate rapid gel filtration to remove the oxidant, generates the oxidized form of wild-type ETF. A comparison of the spectral properties of the oxidized wild-type and αR237A mutant ETF proteins indicates that the peak of flavin absorption (446 nm) in the αR237A mutant is shifted compared with the corresponding peak (438 nm) in wild-type ETF. In addition, the A388/A446ratio (1.01) for αR237A ETF is greater than theA380/A438 ratio (0.89) for wild-type ETF. These observations suggest that the isoalloxazine ring of FAD in αR237A ETF is more exposed to solvent than in wild-type ETF (26Muller F. Mayhew S.G. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), an observation that is consistent with the structural model for M. methylotrophus ETF (19Chohan K.K. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1998; 5: 231-236Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, anaerobic titration of wild-type ETF with sodium dithionite (16Davidson V.L. Husain M. Neher J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 812-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or enzymatic reduction with TMADH (4Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reduces the protein only to the level of the flavin anionic semiquinone (Fig. 3 A). The addition of excess dithionite (6× molar excess) does not reduce the protein further to the dihydroquinone form, even following prolonged incubation (30 min). The potential of the E′2 couple for wild-type ETF is almost certainly more negative than −250 mV (see below) but is more positive than the reduction potential of dithionite (-530 mV). This indicates that there is a substantial kinetic block on full reduction of the flavin. By contrast, reduction of the αR237A mutant ETF with dithionite proceeds to full reduction (Fig. 3, B and C). The two reductive phases (oxidized-semiquinone and semiquinone-dihydroquinone couples) are clearly resolved. The spectral changes accompanying reduction of the oxidized FAD to the anionic semiquinone have isosbestic points at 491 and 391 nm, and a single isosbestic point at 342 nm is seen for reduction of the anionic semiquinone to the dihydroquinone. In all cases, titrations were initiated from fully oxidized ETF and proceeded gradually to the end point of the titration by the addition of small aliquots of sodium dithionite (from 1 and 10 mm stocks) and then back again to oxidized ETF by addition of aliquots of potassium ferricyanide stocks of the same concentration. The protein samples remained completely soluble and stable throughout the course of the titration, enabling collection of good quality sets of spectra. No hysteretical effects were observed in any of the redox titrations. Spectra recorded at similar potentials during oxidative and reductive titrations were essentially identical. Representative spectra for the reductive titration of wild-type ETF and plots of the absorbanceversus potential are shown in Fig.4, A and B. In the reductive titration with wild-type ETF in the presence of mediators, reduction occurs first to the flavin anionic semiquinone, and a small proportion of the flavin is subsequently reduced to the dihydroquinone (Fig. 4 A). Partial reduction to the dihydroquinone does not occur in the absence of mediators (Fig. 3), with reduction taking place only to the level of the flavin anionic semiquinone; this requires further comment. The time taken to complete reductive titrations in the potentiometry experiments was typically around 3–4 h. This is clearly much longer than the time taken to complete the simple spectral analysis shown in Fig. 3. Redox mediators were also included in the potentiometric analysis but were absent in the spectroscopic characterization shown in Fig. 3. The presence of redox mediators and also the long time period for protein reduction ensured more complete equilibration of the system in the potentiometric analyses, but this is clearly not the case with the spectral changes displayed in Fig. 3. Notwithstanding the inclusion of redox mediators and the prolonged time periods of the potentiometry measurements, the spectral changes accompanying reduction of wild-type ETF in the presence of redox mediators indicates that completereduction to the dihydroflavin is not obtained. This is indicated by the presence of considerable semiquinone signature at 370 nm at the end of the titration. Further addition of dithionite did not reduce the absorption at 370 nm to the level seen for the αR237A mutant. That a substantial proportion of the wild-type ETF is reduced beyond the anionic semiquinone level, however, is indicated by the extent of bleaching in the absorption range of 440–470 nm (compared with titrations in the absence of mediators) and the partial bleaching of the absorption at 370 nm (Fig. 4, A and B). The inability to completely reduce wild-type ETF probably reflects the presence of a substantial kinetic block on full reduction for a proportion of the protein sample. Titrations performed in the presence and absence of mediators serve to illustrate the kinetic limitation on reduction to the dihydroquinone form in wild-type ETF, a kinetic bottleneck that can be overcome (at least in part) by the inclusion of redox mediators during the course of reductive titration. That equilibration was achieved with wild-type ETF in the majority of the potentiometric analyses is evident from the stability of the potential readings throughout the reductive titration and from the well defined transitions (Fig. 4 B). The lack of hysteresis on performing the oxidative titration likewise indicates that equilibration was achieved (except at very low potentials) and also that FAD was not released from ETF during the course of the potentiometric titrations. The midpoint reduction potentials forE′1 and E′2 were obtained by fitting the data shown in Fig. 4 A to Equation 1.

A precise E′2 value for the wild-type M. methylotrophus ETF could not be obtained, because the flavin could not be converted completely to the dihydroquinone. As with wild-type ETF, αR237A ETF remained soluble throughout the course of reductive and oxidative titrations, and no hysteresis was observed during the course of reduction by dithionite and reoxidation by ferricyanide. Representative spectra during the course of reductive titration with dithionite are shown in Fig. 4 B, and plots of absorbance versus potential are shown in Fig.4 D. The spectral changes observed during reductive titration (over 3–4 h) are again different from those observed in the spectroscopic characterization of the αR237A ETF shown in Fig. 3, B andC. In Fig. 3, the anionic semiquinone species is populated prior to full reduction to the dihydroquinone, whereas in potentiometric titrations full development of the anionic semiquinone signature at 370 nm is not observed (Fig. 4,C and D). Again, we attribute this to a kinetic limitation that prevents rapid reduction to the dihydroquinone in the absence of mediators (see also the value for E′2below). However, mutation of αArg-237 to Ala partially relieves the kinetic block, because the dihydroquinone clearly does form in the αR237A mutant enzyme during the reductive titration performed without mediators (Fig. 3 C), unlike wild-type ETF, which is reduced only to the level of the flavin semiquinone (Fig. 3 A). We conclude, therefore, that αArg-237 contributes to the kinetic block on reduction to the dihydroquinone seen in wild-type ETF. During reductive titration of the αR237A mutant enzyme, small amounts of red anionic semiquinone are observed, as evidenced by very small increases in absorption at 370 nm during the early phase of reduction (Fig. 4 D). The data at this wavelength fit to a two-electron Nernst function, and the two one-electron reduction steps are resolved as semiquinone (E′1 (oxidized-semiquinone) = −43 ± 2 mV, with E′2(semiquinone-dihydroquinone) = −31 ± 2 mV).

We have recently shown that the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway by Ras-GRF is controlled by the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 through still unknown mechanisms. Here, we report that retaining Cdc42 in its GDP-bound state by overexpressing Rho-GDI inhibits Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation. Conversely, Ras-GRF basal and LPA- or ionomycin-stimulated activities were unaffected by a constitutively active GTP-bound Cdc42. Moreover, the Cdc42 downstream effectors MLK3, ACK1, PAK1, and WASP had no detectable influence on Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation. In contrast, promoting GDP release from Cdc42 with the Rho family GEF Dbl or with ionomycin suppressed the restraint exerted by Cdc42 on Ras-GRF activity. We conclude that Cdc42-GDP inhibits Ras-GRF-induced MAPK activation, but neither Cdc42-GTP nor the Cdc42 downstream effectors affect Ras-GRF performance. Interestingly, the loss of the GDP-bound state by Cdc42 abolishes its inhibitory effects on Ras-GRF function. These results suggest that the Cdc42 mechanism of action may not be solely restricted to activation of downstream signaling cascades when GTP-loaded.

GTPase-activating protein guanine nucleotide exchange factor guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor mitogen-activated protein kinase hemagglutinin glutathioneS-transferase Jun N-terminal kinase myelin basic protein lysophosphatidic acid epidermal growth factor wild type Small GTP-binding proteins act as key molecular switches in signal transduction routes through which stimuli received through cell surface receptors are conveyed to the nucleus. The hallmark of small GTP-binding protein function, the transition from an inactive GDP-bound state to an activated GTP-bound state, is tightly regulated by three types of regulatory proteins: GTPase-activatingproteins (GAPs),1potentiators of the intrinsic capacity of small G proteins to hydrolyze GTP; guanine nucleotide dissociationinhibitors (GDIs) that regulate the nucleotide interchange process by preventing GDP release; and guanine nucleotideexchange factors (GEFs) that initiate the nucleotide replacement cycle by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP (1Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Ras-GRF/Cdc25mn is a GEF for the Ras family of small GTP-binding proteins cloned by virtue of its homology with the CDC25 gene product that stimulates nucleotide exchange on Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ras (2Martegani E.

The primary structure of Ras-GRF reveals the presence of a number of regulatory motifs presumably involved in diverse signaling control mechanisms and protein-protein interactions. These include a Dbl homology (DH) domain (6Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossmann K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), generally present in GEFs for the Rho family of small G proteins (7Van Aelst L. D′Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). The DH domain is flanked by two Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, the function of which remains largely unclear, although it has been suggested that it may play a role in membrane targeting (8Lemmon M.A. Fergusson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). With regard to regulation, it is known that Ras-GRF exchange activity over Ras is augmented by G protein-coupled receptors but is largely unaffected by receptors of the tyrosine kinase type (9Marttingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10Shou C. Wurmser A. Ling K. Barbacid M. Feig L.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1887-1893PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zippel R.

Calcium can also regulate Ras-GRF activity by a mechanism mediated through a calmodulin-binding motif (IQ domain) present in its N terminus (14Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (.a): 21Google Scholar,15Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Gosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). As such, calcium ionophores, like ionomycin, can greatly enhance the activation of the MAPK pathway by Ras-GRF (15Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Gosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have recently shown that the ability of Ras-GRF to activate the Ras/MAPK pathway is regulated by the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 that apparently controls the translocation of Ras-GRF to the membrane (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study we have taken a step further in the investigation of the mechanisms by which Cdc42 regulates the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway by Ras-GRF. We show that Cdc42, retained in a GDP-bound state by the action of the guanine dissociation inhibitor Rho-GDI, acts as a down-regulator of Ras-GRF. Conversely, ectopic expression of either a constitutively activated, GTP-loaded Cdc42 or Cdc42 downstream effector proteins does not affect Ras-GRF-mediated activation of MAPK. Interestingly, inducing GDP release from Cdc42 by the overexpression of Dbl, a bona fide Cdc42 exchange factor, relieves the inhibitory effects exerted by Cdc42 on the activation of the MAPK pathway by Ras-GRF. Plasmids encoding WASP and MLK3 were provided by J. S. Gutkind and PAK1 (L83, L86) by J. Field. A constitutively activated mutant (L543F) of ACK1 and Rho-GDIΔ60 were generated by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis and subcloned in pCDNA3. The sequences of the oligonucleotides utilized are available upon request. All constructs used the CMV promoter (18Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were regularly grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Subconfluent cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran technique (18Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

MAPK and JNK kinase activities were determined as described previously (19Ajenjo N. Aaronson D.S. Ceballos E. Richard C. León J. Crespo P. J. Biol.

Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5× Laemmli buffer and boiled and electrophoresed in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by phosphorimager. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (20Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Total lysates and immunoprecipitates were fractionated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Immunocomplexes were visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cappel). Mouse monoclonal anti-AU5, anti-HA, and anti-Myc antibodies were from Babco. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-Ras-GRF, anti-Cdc42, anti-MLK3, anti-Dbl, and anti-RHO-GDI were from Santa Cruz Laboratories. Subcellular fractionation was performed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 buffer, as described (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C.

Ras GTP loading was performed basically as described by Taylor and Shalloway (21Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cotransfected with AU5-H-Ras and the indicated plasmids were lysed in HEM buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, 4% glycerol, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin. AU5-H-Ras was affinity sequestered with bacterially synthesized GST·Raf Ras Binding Domain (RBD) (amino acids 1–149). Immunoblots were performed as described above using anti-AU5 antibody and quantitated by densitometry, using the program NIH Image 1.60. Ras GTP levels were related to the total Ras protein levels as determined by anti-AU5 immunoblotting in the corresponding cellular lysates. AU5-Cdc42-transfected cells were lysed as above. GTP-bound AU5-Cdc42 was affinity sequestered with bacterially synthesized GST·PAK CRIB (Cdc42/Rac Interaction Binding) domain (amino acids 70–106) basically as described (22Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were performed as described above using anti-AU5 antibody. We have recently demonstrated that the activation of Ras/MAPK by Ras-GRF could be efficiently prevented by the Cdc42 dominant interfering mutant, Cdc42 N17 (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is currently believed that GTPases N17 mutants work by competing with the endogenous proteins for binding to GEFs, thus retaining them in an inactive, GDP-bound form. However, potential pitfalls exist when interpreting results obtained with N17 mutants (23Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Because of this, we tested whether other means of maintaining Cdc42 in its GDP-bound state would also restrain Ras-GRF function. For this purpose, we utilized the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor Rho-GDI (24Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar) that has been shown to prevent GDP dissociation from Cdc42 and other Rho GTPases (25Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko M.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The direct method for analyzing the activity of an exchange factor is by assaying its capacity to catalyze nucleotide exchange on its target GTPase. For this purpose Ras-GRF was cotransfected with AU5-tagged H-Ras into COS-7 cells, in the presence of Cdc42 N17 or Rho-GDI, and Ras-GTP was affinity-precipitated from the resulting cellular lysates with the aid of GST-Raf RBD (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 1 A, Ras-GRF induced a potent incorporation of GTP into Ras. However Ras-GTP levels dropped over 60% when Ras-GRF was cotransfected with Cdc42 N17 or Rho-GDI, indicating that these proteins were effectively blocking Ras-GRF-induced nucleotide exchange on Ras. These results closely matched those obtained when MAPK activation was used to monitor the effects of Rho-GDI on Ras-GRF function. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Rho-GDI blocked Ras-GRF-induced MAPK activation almost as efficiently as Cdc42 N17 when expressed at similar levels. On the other hand, the activation of MAPK by RasV12 was unaltered by Rho-GDI (Fig.1 B), thereby demonstrating that Rho-GDI is affecting the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway upstream from Ras. These data, together with our previous findings (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), clearly demonstrate that the results obtained by direct measurement of Ras GDP/GTP exchange are identical to those obtained by assaying the activation of MAPK. Thus, we have chosen MAPK activation as a valid readout for further experimentation. Calcium ionophores and certain agents acting through G protein-coupled receptors such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) have been shown to boost Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation (9Marttingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 15Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Gosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 16Buchsbaum R. Telliez J. Gooneskera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, we also tested the effects of Rho-GDI on the activity of Ras-GRF under the influence of external stimuli. In agreement with our previous observations, Rho-GDI potently inhibited Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation when stimulated by ionomycin or LPA but had no effects on MAPK activation elicited by EGF (Fig. 1 C), which is known to be Ras-GRF-independent (10Shou C. Wurmser A. Ling K. Barbacid M. Feig L.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1887-1893PubMed Google Scholar,11Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism through which a G protein can be kept in its GDP form is by potentiating its GTPase activity, which can be accomplished by the overexpression of adequate GAP proteins. Therefore, we determined if p50Rho-GAP (27Morii N. Kawano K. Sekine A. Yamada T. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7646-7650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), known to have a potent GAP activity against Cdc42 (28Hart M.J. Shinjo K. Hall A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20840-20848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could also prevent the activation of MAPK by Ras-GRF. As expected, p50Rho-GAP could block the stimulation of MAPK by Ras-GRF just as efficiently as Rho-GDI (Fig. 1 D). These effects could not be attributed to differences in the protein levels of the HA·MAPK cotransfected in these assays, since the protein was equally well expressed in all cases (Fig. 1 C,lower panel). In summary, our results showing that Cdc42 N17, Rho-GDI, and p50Rho-GAP can clearly abrogate the activation of MAPK by Ras-GRF, strongly point to the maintenance of Cdc42 in its GDP-bound state as the underlying cause of the Cdc42 inhibitory effects on Ras-GRF activity. Also, these results suggest that the effects of Cdc42 N17 on Ras-GRF function are not due to other indirect mechanisms. It should be noted that both Rho-GDI and p50Rho-GAP are also active on the Rho family GTPases Rho and Rac (25Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko M.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28Hart M.J. Shinjo K. Hall A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20840-20848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have previously described that unlike Cdc42, the dominant inhibitory mutants of Rho and Rac have no detectable effects on the activation of MAPK induced by Ras-GRF (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In light of this data, it is reasonable to attribute the effects of Rho-GDI and p50Rho-GAP on Ras-GRF function, mainly to their influence on Cdc42. It has been shown thatin vitro Rho-GDI is able to interact equally well with the inactive GDP-bound state of Rho proteins and the active GTP-bound form (29Nomanbhoy T.K. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10004-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This circumstance should be taken into account when interpreting the effects of Rho-GDI on the functional relationship between Ras-GRF and Cdc42. To clarify this point, we investigated the interaction of Rho-GDI and Cdc42 in our cellular system. COS-7 cells were transfected with wild-type AU5-tagged Cdc42 that is GDP-bound under serum-starvation conditions or with AU5-Cdc42 Q61L (QL) found in a GTP state under the same experimental conditions. Upon anti-AU5 immunoprecipitation, it was found that endogenous Rho-GDI associated strongly with Cdc42-wt but was undetected in Cdc42-QL immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 A). This may reflect the observation that association of Rho-GDI with the GTP-bound form of Rho GTPases takes place mainly in vitro(29Nomanbhoy T.K. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10004-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Other reports indicate that Rho-GDI interacts with the GTP-bound form of its cognate proteins much less efficiently than with the GDP-bound form (30Sasaki T. Kato M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23959-23963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), quite in line with our results. Moreover, in absolute agreement with our observations, a recent in vivostudy undertaken in COS-1 cells clearly demonstrates that Rho-GDI does not bind to Cdc42-QL (31Michaelson D. Silleti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Although it cannot be excluded that under certain physiological circumstances Rho-GDI could bind to Cdc42-GTP, under our experimental conditions and in our cellular environment, Rho-GDI is preferentially associated to Cdc42-GDP. In addition to its capability of inhibiting GDP release from Rho family G-proteins, Rho-GDI can also bring about the extraction of Rho proteins from cellular membranes, thus rendering the GTPases cytoplasmic and therefore inactive (24Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar, 25Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko M.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Nomanbhoy T.K. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1744-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It was of interest to determine whether Rho-GDI effects on Ras-GRF could be somehow associated with this feature. For this purpose, AU5-Cdc42 was coexpressed with Myc-tagged Rho-GDI, and its cellular distribution was examined. Subcellular fractionation of the COS-7 lysates demonstrated that in the absence of exogenous Rho-GDI, Cdc42 was found in the cell particulate fraction as expected (Fig. 2 B). However, despite high levels of expression, as verified by anti-Myc immunoblotting, Rho-GDI did not alter the cellular distribution of Cdc42, because no Cdc42 could be detected in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2 B). This demonstrates that in our cellular system and under our experimental conditions, Rho-GDI did not provoke the release of Cdc42 from the cell membranes. The fact that Rho-GDI effectively solubilizes Cdc42 in other cell types such as human placental cells and epidermal carcinoma cells (25Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko M.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that other unknown cell-specific factors may determine whether Rho-GDI membrane-extracting activity is functional, depending on the cell type and/or physiological circumstances. A recent report suggests that the solubilization of Rho GTPases is strictly dependent on the stoichiometric relationship between Rho-GDI and its cognate GTPases (31Michaelson D. Silleti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that the concentrations of Rho-GDI utilized in our assays, although sufficient to inhibit nucleotide exchange, are not high enough to solubilize Cdc42. Indeed, we have observed that steadily increasing the concentration of Rho-GDI brings about a gradual solubilization of Cdc42 (data not shown). The possibility exists that Rho-GDI could inhibit Ras-GRF function through a direct interaction by sequestering it unproductively in the cytoplasm. To test this hypothesis, we cotransfected AU5-Rho-GDI with Ras-GRF and assayed its ability to coimmunoprecipitate. As shown in Fig. 2 C, no Ras-GRF was detected in association with anti-AU5 immunoprecipitates, either under basal or ionomycin-stimulated conditions, indicating that no direct interaction exists between Rho-GDI and Ras-GRF. On the other hand, it was found that Rho-GDI markedly inhibited Cdc42 GDP/GTP exchange induced by the GEF Dbl or by stimulation with ionomycin (data not shown) as determined by Cdc42-GTP pull-down assays using the GST·PAK CRIB domain (see “Materials and Methods”). To further substantiate the notion that Rho-GDI down-regulatory effects over Ras-GRF were mainly due to its function as an inhibitor of Cdc42 nucleotide exchange, we made use of Rho-GDIΔ60. This mutant lacks the 60 N-terminal amino acids, a region that contributes little to binding but is necessary to inhibit nucleotide dissociation from Cdc42 (33Gosser Y.Q. Nomanbhoy T.K. Aghazadeh B. Manor D. Combs C. Cerione R.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 D, the activation of MAPK brought about by Ras-GRF was clearly inhibited by AU5-Rho-GDI, but was largely unaffected by AU5-Rho-GDIΔ60 when expressed at similar levels. These results clearly demonstrate that Rho-GDI inhibitory effects over Ras-GRF reside with its ability to repress the dissociation of GDP from Cdc42. Overall, our results demonstrate that under our experimental conditions: (i) Rho-GDI does not associate with Cdc42 when in a GTP-bound state; (ii) Rho-GDI is ineffective in rendering Cdc42 cytoplasmic; and (iii) Rho-GDI does not interact directly with Ras-GRF. Furthermore, our data prove that the effects of Rho-GDI on Ras-GRF function are primarily due to its role as a blocker of Cdc42 nucleotide exchange, thus to maintain Cdc42 in a GDP-bound form. Our previous findings demonstrate that the inhibition of Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation by Cdc42 N17 correlates with the reduction of Ras-GRF protein levels in the cell particulate fraction (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that Cdc42, when GDP-bound, would be interfering with Ras-GRF translocation to the cell membranes. If this was the case, Rho-GDI, which as shown before retains Cdc42 in its GDP-bound form, would be expected to prevent a Ras-GRF presence in the membrane fraction. To test this point, we analyzed Ras-GRF cellular distribution upon cotransfection with Rho-GDI. As shown in Fig. 3, in the absence of ectopic Rho-GDI, Ras-GRF was evenly distributed between the particulate and soluble fractions. However, cotransfection of Rho-GDI markedly diminished Ras-GRF levels in the membrane fraction. This effect clearly correlated with the inhibition of Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation by Rho-GDI (Fig. 3). On the other hand, the activation of MAPK induced by a membrane-bound Ras-GRF-CAAX (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was unaffected by Rho-GDI. Likewise, the cellular distribution of this membrane-targeted Ras-GRF was unaltered by Rho-GDI (Fig. 3). These results are in perfect agreement with our previous observations using Cdc42 N17 (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and suggest that Cdc42 in its GDP state, regardless of the mechanism by which this state is achieved, abrogates Ras-GRF activation by preventing its localization to the cell particulate fraction. A vast collection of data gathered hitherto indicates that most biological processes that are inhibited or diminished by the action of a “switched off” GDP-bound GTPase are activated or potentiated by the “switched on” GTP-bound form of the GTPase. Thus, it would be conceivable that the activation of MAPK by Ras-GRF, which is inhibited by Cdc42-GDP, should be potentiated by Cdc42-GTP. To verify this point, we tested whether the Cdc42 constitutively active mutant, Cdc42-QL, would be capable of boosting the MAPK response induced by Ras-GRF. For this purpose Ras-GRF was cotransfected with increasing amounts of Cdc42-QL into COS-7 cells. It was found that Cdc42-QL strongly activated JNK (Fig.4 A, middle panel), known to be a downstream target of Cdc42 (18Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). However, it did not affect MAPK activation elicited by different concentrations of Ras-GRF (Fig. 4 A, top and lower panels), thus suggesting that basal Ras-GRF-induced MAPK activation is independent of Cdc42-GTP levels. In a similar fashion, overexpression of Cdc42-QL did not alter Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation in cells treated with ionomycin or LPA (Fig. 4 B), indicating that the externally stimulated activation of MAPK mediated by Ras-GRF is also largely insensitive to the amount of Cdc42-GTP present in the cell. To further substantiate this point, we also tested whether several proteins known to be activated by Cdc42-GTP and well proven asbona fide Cdc42 effectors (7Van Aelst L. D′Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar) would be capable of potentiating Ras-GRF function. Hyperactive forms of ACK1 (L543F) (34Kiyono M. Kato J. Kataoka T.

Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) were found to be well expressed and/or to potently activate JNK upon transfection into COS-7 cells (Fig. 4 C, middle and lower panels). However, they were unable to augment even slightly the activation of MAPK induced by Ras-GRF in an experimental setting in which ionomycin strongly potentiated Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation (Fig. 4 C, top panel). Overall, these results clearly demonstrate that the activation of MAPK by Ras-GRF, although inhibited by Cdc42-GDP, is unaffected either by GTP-loaded Cdc42 or by Cdc42 effector proteins. These data strongly support our initial observations that Cdc42-QL does not affect the presence of Ras-GRF in the cell particulate fraction (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although they conflict with a recent report in which ACK1 was found to synergize with Ras-GRF in the activation of MAPK (34Kiyono M. Kato J. Kataoka T. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29788-29793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the cellular and/or experimental conditions utilized in the last study was such that Ras-GRF activity was affected by stimuli signaled by receptors of the tyrosine kinase type such as EGF, in contrast to previous results (9Marttingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10Shou C. Wurmser A. Ling K. Barbacid M. Feig L.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1887-1893PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the intensifying effect of ionomycin over Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation can be blocked by Cdc42 N17. We have also demonstrated that ionomycin induces nucleotide exchange on Cdc42 (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This implies that relieving the blockade that Cdc42-GDP exerts on Ras-GRF could be a requisite for fully enhancing Ras-GRF potential to activate the Ras/MAPK pathway. To test this hypothesis, we tested whether exchange factors for Cdc42 would be capable of rescuing the restraint on Ras-GRF activity caused by GDP-bound Cdc42. We have previously reported that high concentrations of Cdc42-wt, mainly GDP-loaded under the serum-starved conditions used in our assays, can be as efficient as Cdc42 N17 for inhibiting Ras-GRF (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indeed, MAPK activation by Ras-GRF was remarkably diminished upon cotransfection with 1 μg of Cdc42-wt (Fig.5 A). Interestingly, MAPK activation levels were completely restored by coexpression of the GEF Dbl (38Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A), in agreement with our previous findings in which Dbl was shown to be capable of potentiating Ras-GRF-induced MAPK activation (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This effect could not be attributed to the stimulation of MAPK through alternative routes, such as the PAK>MEK>MAPK connection (39King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), as Dbl did not affect MAPK when acting alone (Ref. 17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and data not shown). Likewise, ionomycin was also capable of completely rescuing Ras-GRF activity. On the other hand, the GEF Ost and Cdc42-QL were incapable of overcoming the inhibitory effects of Cdc42-wt (Fig. 5 A). The ineffectiveness of Ost, despite high expression levels (not shown), is noteworthy, as Ost has been reported to act as a Cdc42 GEF in vitro (40Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A likely explanation could be that Ost is not a GEF for Cdc42 in vivo, at least in COS-7 cells. In a similar fashion, other Rho family exchange factors such as Vav, which is not active over Cdc42 (41Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), also fail to affect Ras-GRF activity (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Finally, we explored whether GEFs for Cdc42 could also alleviate the inhibition of Ras-GRF activity brought about by Rho-GDI. For this purpose, Ras-GRF was cotransfected with equal concentrations of Cdc42-wt and Rho-GDI. Both constructs were able to markedly diminish the activation of MAPK induced by Ras-GRF (Fig. 5 B). The coexpression of increasing concentrations of Dbl, gradually counteracted the repression on Ras-GRF caused by Cdc42-wt. This effect was also observed in Rho-GDI-transfected cells, although in this case, the amount of Dbl necessary to initiate the rescue of Ras-GRF activity was 2-fold higher (Fig. 5 B). This can be explained as Rho-GDI induces a potent inhibitory effect on GDP release catalyzed by Dbl, which can only be overcome by high concentrations of this GEF (25Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko M.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the wild-type version of Dbl, proto Dbl, known to have a weaker nucleotide exchange activity on Cdc42 (38Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was less effective for rescuing Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation (Fig. 5 B). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that Cdc42 in its GDP-bound form, acts as a potent down-regulator of Ras-GRF-induced activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway. However, Cdc42 in a GTP-bound state does not have the expected potentiating effect on Ras-GRF function. This is clearly envisioned by the unresponsiveness of Ras-GRF to Cdc42-activated downstream effector proteins and to hyperactive Cdc42-QL, and by the inability of this mutant to rescue the restraint exerted on Ras-GRF activity by the overexpression of Cdc42-wt. Despite this, we show that the stimulation of GDP release from Cdc42, with the aid of agents that promote GDP/GTP exchange such as an external stimulus like ionomycin or the ectopic expression of a specific GEF for Cdc42, strongly facilitates the activation of MAPK by Ras-GRF. The most plausible model that emerges from these data is one in which the loss of Cdc42 GDP-bound structural characteristics rather than the acquisition of a GTP-bound structural conformation, would be the key step for relieving the inhibitory effect that Cdc42 imposes on Ras-GRF function. Based on this hypothesis, the conformational features of Cdc42 when GDP-loaded would enable it to exert an inhibitory effect over Ras-GRF activity by still unknown mechanisms. This inhibition would be unaffected by the presence of ectopic Cdc42-GTP or Cdc42-activated effectors. However, catalyzing GDP release from Cdc42 would bring about the structural change, concomitant with the acquisition of a GTP-bound conformation, which would relieve the restraint exerted over Ras-GRF functions. If this were the case, the mode of action of Cdc42 would not be restricted solely to the stimulation of downstream effector proteins, such as those bearing CRIB domains (7Van Aelst L. D′Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar), when in an activated, GTP-bound state. In addition, when GDP-loaded, Cdc42 may be acting as a down-regulator of the Ras/MAPK pathway by inhibiting the activity of Ras-specific GEFs. This double mechanism of action, although hitherto unprecedented among small GTP-binding proteins, is no stranger in the world of G proteins. Indeed, heterotrimeric G proteins function in that way. As such, Gα subunits when GTP-loaded directly stimulate downstream effectors like PLCβ or adenylate cyclase (42Dohlman H.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2657-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Also, when in a GDP-bound state, Gα subunits act by sequestering Gβγ dimers, thereby preventing this component from interacting with its own effectors (43Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that one of the main pathways triggered by Gβγ dimers, thus inhibited by GDP-bound Gα subunits and unaffected by the ectopic expression of constitutively active Gα subunits, is the Ras/MAPK pathway (20Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that in the case of heterotrimeric G proteins the connection between the Gβγ complex and Ras exchange factors is not direct and implies the presence of many intermediaries (44Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). At present, whether this model can be applicable to Cdc42 needs to be fully validated. As yet, we ignore the precise mechanism by which Cdc42 inhibits Ras-GRF. Our previous results (17Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S. Teramoto H. Ighishi T. Zabala J.C. Gutkind J.S. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26441-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) do not indicate a direct physical interaction between Ras-GRF and Cdc42, at least in vitro. That suggests the participation of additional components, in a fashion also reminiscent of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Elucidating the exact mechanism of action and the identity of these components is necessary in future investigations. We thank J. S. Gutkind and J. Field for providing us with reagents."

In retinal rod cells, photoexcited rhodopsin induces GDP/GTP exchange on the visual G protein, transducin (Gt), and liberated GtαGTP activates PDE6. A homologous cascade operates in cone photoreceptors. cGMP hydrolysis by active PDE6 results in the closure of cGMP-gated channels in the plasma membrane (1Chabre M. Deterre P. Eur. J.

The key attributes of the visual cascade, low noise and high gain signal amplification, place specific requirements on PDE6. The enzyme must have a very low basal cGMP hydrolytic rate in the dark-adapted photoreceptors and a very high catalytic rate in the transducin-activated state.

PDE5 and PDE6 display a high degree of identity (45–48%) between the catalytic domains, a strong substrate selectivity for cGMP, and similar sensitivity to a common set of competitive inhibitors (7McAllister-Lucas L.M.

Recently, we have shown that a substitution of the segment PDE5-(773–820) by the corresponding PDE6α′-(737–784) sequence in the wild-type PDE5 or in a PDE5/PDE6α′ chimera containing the catalytic domain of PDE5 results in chimeric enzymes capable of inhibitory interaction with Pγ (6Granovsky A.E.

We then hypothesized that Pγ may interact with additional nonconserved residues located at the perimeter of the cavity, thus allowing Pγ to serve as a lid on the catalytic pocket. In this study, we mutated three candidate Pγ contact residues identified from the model of PDE6α′ and examined these mutants for inhibition by Pγ. The rationale for our search of the catalytic determinants of PDE6 was based on biochemical evidence and the crystal structure of the PDE4 catalytic domain (18Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Grimes K.A.

We replaced PDE6α′ domains containing motifs I and II into PDE5. Resulting chimeric PDEs and corresponding mutants have been analyzed to test our hypothesis. cGMP was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [3H]cGMP was a product of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase was a product of PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and Pfu DNA polymerase was a product of Stratagene. Rabbit polyclonal His-probe (H-15) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Zaprinast and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Pγ mutants were generated based on the pET11a-Pγ expression vector (21Skiba N.P. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13210-13215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Artemyev N.O. Arshavsky V.Y. Cote R.H. Methods. 1998; 14: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Residues Ile86 and Ile87 were substituted for alanine using PCR-directed mutagenesis. PCR products were obtained using a forward primer containing a NdeI site and a reverse primer containing the mutations and a BamHI site. The fragments were digested with NdeI/BamHI and subcloned into the pET11a-Pγ digested with the same enzymes. The Pγ-subunit and its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on a SP-Sepharose fast flow column and on a C4 HPLC column (Microsorb-MW, Rainin) as described (22Artemyev N.O. Arshavsky V.Y. Cote R.H. Methods. 1998; 14: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were lyophilized, dissolved in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5 and stored at −80 °C until use. The constructs for expression of PDE5/PDE6α′ chimeras were obtained based on pFastBacHTb-PDE5 vector (5Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Haik T.L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24485-24490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To obtain Chi20 and Chi21, original restriction sites in pFastBacHTb-PDE5, SpeI and SphI, were eliminated and re-introduced at desired positions to allow a site-directed cloning of PDE6α′ fragments into PDE5. To eliminate two SpeI restriction sites located within the 3′-untranslated region of PDE5 cDNA and the unique SphI site from the multiple cloning sequence of the vector, pFastBacHTb-PDE5 was digested withSpeI/SphI and treated with mung bean nuclease. New SpeI and SphI restriction sites (PDE5 codons for Arg606-His607-Ala608 and Ala618-Leu619-Lys620, respectively) were introduced into the vector using a QuikChangeTM kit (Stratagene). To obtain Chi21 (Fig. 1), a synthetic olygonucleotide duplex, encoding for PDE6α′-(561–574), was ligated into the modified pFastBacHTb-PDE5 vector digested with SpeI andSphI. To generate Chi20, a PCR fragment, encoding for PDE6α′-(575–617), was digested with SpeI/BlpI and subcloned into the modified pFastBacHTb-PDE5 vector digested withSpeI/BlpI(partial). The resulting construct was digested with SpeI/SphI and ligated to the synthetic oligonucleotide duplex encoding for PDE6α′-(561–574). Site-directed mutagenesis of PDE5 was performed using a QuikChangeTM kit. A pair of complementary oligonucleotides encoding for the Ala608→Gly and Ala612→Gly substitutions (PDE5A608G/A612G) was used to PCR-amplify the pFastBacHTb-PDE5 vector. The PCR product was treated with DpnI to eliminate the template and was transformed into E. coli DH5α. Chi16 mutants with single substitutions of residues Lys769, Phe777, and Phe781 by Ala were constructed using PCR-directed mutagenesis. A unique NheI site (PDE5 codons for Pro661-Leu662) was introduced into Chi16 using a QuikChangeTM kit. The 5′-primer sequence included the NheI recognition site. Reverse primers contained a desired mutation and the StuI site. The PCR products were digested with NheI/StuI and subcloned into the modified Chi16 vector cut with the same enzymes. Sequences of all mutants were verified by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. Sf9 cells were harvested at 60 h after infection, washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8 containing 50 mm NaCl, and resuspended in the same buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (10 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell suspensions were sonicated using 30-s pulses for a total duration of 3 min. The supernatants (100,000 ×g, 45 min) were loaded onto a column with a His-Bind resin (Novagen) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 10 mm imidazole. The resin was washed with a 5× volume of the buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 25 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted with the buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. β-mercaptoethanol (2 mm) was added to the eluate. PDE5, Chi20, Chi21, and PDE5A608G/A612G were additionally purified using ion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q® HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified proteins were dialyzed against 40% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. PDE activity was measured using [3H]cGMP as described (23Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 539-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Less than 15% of cGMP was hydrolyzed during these reactions. The K i values for inhibition of PDE activity by Pγ and zaprinast were measured using 0.5 μm cGMP (i.e. <35% of theK m value for chimeric and mutant PDEs). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) using IgG as a standard or by using calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm. The molar concentrations of Chi20, Chi21, and mutatnt PDEs, [PDE], were calculated based on the fraction of PDE protein in preparations, and the molecular mass of 93.0 kDa. The fractional concentrations of PDE were determined from analysis of the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels using a HP ScanJet II CX/T scanner and Scion Image Beta 4.02 software. A typical fraction of Chi16 mutants in partially purified preparations was 10–15%. A typical fraction of purified Chi20, Chi21, and PDE5A608G/A612G was 65–70%. The k catvalues for cGMP hydrolysis were calculated asV max/[PDE]. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar) in 10–12% acrylamide gels. For Western immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (0.1 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) and analyzed using rabbit His-probe (H-15) or sheep anti-PDE6α′ antibodies (5Granovsky A.E.

The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using anti-rabbit or anti-goat/sheep IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.). Fitting the experimental data to equations was performed with nonlinear least squares criteria using GraphPad Prizm Software. The K i ,K m , and IC50 values are expressed as mean ± S.E. for three independent measurements. Previously, we demonstrated that PDE5/PDE6α′ chimeras containing a PDE6α′ sequence, PDE6α′-(737–784), are effectively inhibited by Pγ, and two residues, Met758 and Gln752, participate in the inhibitory interaction (6Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41258-41262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based on the model structure of PDE6α′ (6Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41258-41262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), three solvent-exposed nonconserved PDE6α′ residues, Lys769, Phe777, and Phe781, were chosen for further mutational analysis of the Pγ binding region (Fig.1 A). A PDE5/PDE6α′ chimera, Chi16 (6Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41258-41262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), served as a template for single substitutions of these residues by Ala. The Chi16 mutants were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and partially purified. Expression of the K769A, F777A, and F781A mutants have yielded similar amounts of soluble protein (50–100 μg/100 ml of culture). Neither of these mutations has significantly affected the catalytic properties of chimeric PDE. TheK m and k cat values for cGMP hydrolysis for all three mutants were in the 3–10 μmrange, and the 5–10 s−1 range, respectively (TableI). As an additional control for the structural integrity of the catalytic site, mutants of Chi16 were tested for the PDE activity inhibition by zaprinast, a specific competitive inhibitor of PDE5 and PDE6. The largest change, a 2-fold increase in the IC50 value, was caused by the F781A substitution (Table I). Nonetheless, such a change represents an insignificant loss of affinity to zaprinast.Table IFunctional properties of PDE5/PDE6α′ chimerasPDEK mk catIC50for zaprinastK i for PγK i for PγI86AK i for PγI87Aμms −1μmnm(max. effect, %)nm(max. effect, %)nm (max. effect, %)PDE6α′23 ± 21-aThe data are from Ref. 5.35001-aThe data are from Ref. 5.0.28 ± 0.051-aThe data are from Ref. 5.0.17 ± 0.02 (100)1-aThe data are from Ref. 5.0.75 ± 0.08 (95)0.65 ± 0.04 (100)Chi162.8 ± 0.51-bThe data are from Ref. 6.9.01-bThe data are from Ref. 6.0.12 ± 0.011-bThe data are from Ref. 6.3.6 ± 0.4 (90)1-bThe data are from Ref. 6.13 ± 1 (65)6.6 ± 1.0 (70)K769A2.2 ± 0.28.90.16 ± 0.012.9 ± 0.4 (90)F777A4.8 ± 0.77.20.19 ± 0.0119 ± 2 (45)96 ± 13 (45)64 ± 8 (25)F781A6.1 ± 0.77.50.28 ± 0.0231 ± 5 (65)49 ± 8 (40)32 ± 2 (55)M758A9.5 ± 0.91-bThe data are from Ref. 6.8.91-bThe data are from Ref. 6.0.26 ± 0.011-bThe data are from Ref. 6.97 ± 10 (75)1-bThe data are from Ref. 6.N/A (<20)N/A (<20)PDE53.3 ± 0.41-aThe data are from Ref. 5.9.61-aThe data are from Ref. 5.0.54 ± 0.02A608G/A612G14 ± 11050.30 ± 0.03Chi2012 ± 11160.35 ± 0.05Chi2117 ± 21100.39 ± 0.05PDE activity was measured using [3H]cGMP (24Natochin M.

The test of the ability of Chi16 mutants to be inhibited by Pγ showed that the K769A mutation had no effect on the inhibitory interaction with Pγ (K i 2.9 nm) (Table I). Two other mutants, F777A and F781A, displayed significant impairments in the inhibition by Pγ. The F777A substitution reduced both the maximal inhibition of PDE activity by Pγ (∼45%) and theK i value (K i of 19 nm). The inhibition of F781A mutant by Pγ also was incomplete (∼65%) and associated with an increase in theK i value (K i of 31 nm) (Fig. 2 A and Table I). C-terminal Pγ mutants were designed based on the evidence for the critical role of the Pγ C terminus in PDE6 inhibition (21Skiba N.P. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13210-13215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Brown R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5918-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The two extreme C-terminal Pγ residues, Ile86 and Ile87, were replaced by Ala to obtain the PγI86A and PγI87A mutants, respectively. The Pγ mutants were analyzed for their ability to inhibit trypsin-activated PDE6α′ (tPDE), Chi16, and the M758A, F777A, and F781A mutants (Fig. 2; TableI). PγI86A and PγI87A fully inhibited tPDE activity. However, the potency of the inhibition was reduced ∼4–5-fold (K i of 0.75 nm for PγI86A andK i of 0.65 nm for PγI87A, compared with Ki of 0.15–0.2 nm for Pγ). A similar increase in the K i values was observed from the inhibition of Chi16 activity by PγI86A (K i of 13 nm) and PγI87A (K i of 7 nm) (Fig. 2, B and C; Table I). Yet, PγI86A and PγI87A did not fully inhibit Chi16, maximal inhibition was 65 and 70%, respectively. (Fig. 2, B and C; Table I). No appreciable inhibition of M758A by either Pγ mutant was seen even at inhibitor concentrations as high as 5 μm. The inhibition of F777A by PγI86A was partial (45%) with theK i value of 96 nm, whereas PγI87A inhibited this Chi16 mutant with an even smaller maximal effect (25%,K i of 64 nm). The F781A mutant was inhibited by PγI86A and PγI87A with K i values of 49 and 32 nm and maximal effects of 40 and 55%, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C; Table I). Two conserved metal binding motifs found in all PDEs are absolutely critical for cyclic nucleotide hydrolytic activity (18Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Grimes K.A. Corbin J.D.

To identify the structural elements responsible for the unique catalytic properties of PDE6, chimeric PDE5/PDE6α′ have been generated by introduction into PDE5 of PDE6α′ domains containing metal binding motifs, I and II. A replacement of the PDE6α′-(562–617) segment into PDE5 yields a chimeric PDE5/PDE6α′, Chi20, that incorporates both PDE6α′ metal binding sites and the connecting sequence (Fig. 1 A). Chi20 was expressed in Sf9 cells as a functional enzyme at ∼400 μg/100 ml and purified to ∼ 65–70% purity (Fig. 1 B). The catalytic characteristics of Chi20 were examined in comparison to those of PDE5 and native PDE6α′. PDE6α′ has reportedK m (17–25 μm) andk cat (3500–4500 moles of cGMP per mole of PDE·s) values for cGMP hydrolysis that are ∼5 and ∼400-fold higher than the respective constants for PDE5 (5Granovsky A.E.

Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic parameters of Chi20 were significantly different from those of PDE5. Chi20 hydrolyzed cGMP with the K m value of 12 μm, which is ∼4-fold higher than theK m value for PDE5 but similar to that of PDE6α′ (Table I). The maximal activity of 116 moles of cGMP per mole of PDE·s for Chi20 is ∼10-fold higher than that of PDE5. Chi20 was inhibited by zaprinast with the IC50 value of 0.35 μm, which is comparable with that of PDE5 (Table I). To determine the role of individual metal binding motifs and their adjacent regions in cGMP hydrolysis by PDE6, we inserted a PDE6α′ fragment corresponding to the helix-α6 (20Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), PDE6α′-(562–574), into PDE5 (Chi21) (Fig. 1). The catalytic properties of Chi21 and the inhibition by zaprinast (K m of 17 μm,k cat of 110 moles of cGMP per mole of PDE·s, and IC50 0.39 μm) were similar to those of Chi20. The alignment of sequences from different PDE families corresponding to the α6 helix shows a glycine residue, PDE6α′Gly562, conserved only in photoreceptor PDEs (Fig.3 A). A second Gly residue, PDE6α′Gly566, is conserved in PDE6α′ and PDE6α, but substituted by Ala in PDE6β and PDE5 (Fig. 3 A). To test the hypothesis that Gly562 and Gly566 of PDE6α′ are responsible for the differences in catalytic properties of Chi21 and PDE5, a doubly substituted mutant of PDE5, A608G and A612G, was expressed and purified from Sf9 cells. Similar to Chi20 and Chi21, PDE5A608G/A612G hydrolyzed cGMP with a K m value of 14 μm and a k cat value of 105 moles of cGMP per mole of PDE·s (Table I). An interaction between PDE6 catalytic and inhibitory Pγ-subunits keeps the visual effector enzyme inhibited in the dark. Previous biochemical studies have established that the γ-subunit of photoreceptor PDE inhibits the enzyme activity by blocking its catalytic site (29Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11686-11689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The major inhibitory domain has been localized to the Pγ C terminus (21Skiba N.P. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13210-13215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Brown R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5918-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that Pγ inhibits the activity of PDE5/PDE6α′ chimera, Chi 16, containing residues PDE6α′-(737–784) (6Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41258-41262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Essential Pγ binding residues, Gln752 and Met758, of PDEα′ have been identified via mutagenesis of Chi16 (6Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41258-41262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A model of the PDE6α′ catalytic domain places Met758 at the opening of the catalytic pocket (6Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41258-41262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hypothetically, to ensure an effective catalytic block, the Pγ C terminus may lie over or might be inserted into the catalytic cavity. The former appears more likely because the catalytic pockets of different cyclic nucleotide PDEs are made up of highly conserved residues, whereas the inhibition by Pγ is a unique attribute of PDE6. We speculated that to cover the catalytic pocket, the Pγ C terminus, besides Met758, interacts with additional nonconserved residues located at the perimeter of the entrance to the active site. The fact that the introduction of PDE6α′-(737–784) into PDE5/PDE6α′ chimera leads to a full inhibition of the PDE activity by Pγ suggests the PDE6α′-(737–784) segment contains most if not all residues interacting with the Pγ C terminus. In the PDE6α′ model, PDE6α′-(737–784) comprises about half of the catalytic cavity mouth. Residues at three positions within PDE6α′-(737–784) (Lys769, Phe777, and Phe781) are conserved among photoreceptor PDEs but have nonhomologous substitutions in PDE5. Supporting our hypothesis, replacement of two residues, Phe777 and Phe781, by Ala in Chi16 has resulted in mutant PDEs that in comparison with Chi16 were less potently and incompletely inhibited by Pγ. Phe777 and Phe781 are located next to each other, opposite to the Met758 side of the catalytic opening (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, it appears that the Pγ C terminus makes a bridge over the catalytic pocket. Such a model provides an interesting explanation to the results of an earlier study that examined inhibition of PDE6 by C-terminally truncated Pγ mutants (21Skiba N.P. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13210-13215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Truncations of one or two of the C-terminal Ile86-Ile87 residues led to substantial increases in the K i value, whereas further truncations, up to 8–11 C-terminal residues, reduced the maximal inhibition of PDE6 activity without significantly affecting theK i value (21Skiba N.P. Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13210-13215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A plausible interpretation is that PγIle86-Ile87 interact with residues on one side of the catalytic pocket and other residues, perhaps Pγ-(77–85), stretch over the catalytic cavity until Pγ reaches the opposite side. Accordingly, removal of PγIle86-Ile87decreases the affinity of Pγ for the PDE6 catalytic subunit, whereas progressive removal of Pγ-(77–85) residues gradually facilitates access of cGMP to the catalytic site. To determine the orientation of the Pγ C terminus against the catalytic site and identify point-to-point interactions with PDE6α′, we examined the inhibition of Chi16 and the M758A, F777A, and F781A mutants of Chi16 by two Pγ mutants, PγI86A and PγI87A. The simplest prediction is that if a C-terminal Ile of Pγ interacts with one of the three PDE6α′ residues, the corresponding mutant PDE would be inhibited comparably by Pγ and by the Pγ mutant. Complicating this prediction, side chains of Phe777 and Phe781 make a hydrophobic contact and thereby may support each other in the interaction with Pγ. The analysis of inhibition of Chi16 mutants by Pγ mutants indicates that Ile86 and Ile87 of Pγ interact with Phe777 and Phe781 of PDE6α′. Moderate increases in the K i values and reductions in the maximal inhibition of F777A and F781A caused by the PγI86A substitution suggest that Ile86 probably contacts one or both the PDE6α′ residues. The failure of PγI86A to inhibit M758A is consistent with the notion that Ile86 binds Phe777/781, but not Met758. The lack of inhibition is likely caused by the inability of M758A and PγI86A to establish at least two of the three critical contacts involving Met758, Phe777, and Phe781. The PγI87A mutant did not appreciably inhibit the activity of the M758A mutant PDE. PγI87A inhibited F781A stronger than F777A pointing to a probable contact between PγIle87 and Phe781of PDE6α′. The incomplete inhibition of mutant PDEs by Pγ or Pγ mutants most likely reflects equivalent partial inhibition of both active sites of the catalytic dimer, rather than the loss of inhibition at one site. The analysis of Pγ secondary structure predicts an α-helical structure for the C-terminal residues Pγ-(75–84) (30Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C terminus of Pγ, Pγ-(75–87), manually docked to the PDE6α′ catalytic site is shown in Fig. 3, B and C. The model assumes the helical structure of Pγ-(75–84) and the contacts between PγIle86-Ile87 and PDE6α′Phe777-Phe781. This orientation of Pγ is also consistent with Gln752 of PDE6α′ (6Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41258-41262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) making a contact with a Pγ residue located N-terminally to Pγ-(75–87). The remarkable ability of photoreceptor PDEs to hydrolyze cGMP with a catalytic rate constant of ∼4000–5500 moles of cGMP per mole of PDE·s (12Mou H. Grazio III, H.J. Cook T.A. Beavo J.A. Cote R.H.

Physiol. 1994; 103: 1071-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) is essential to the signal amplification in the visual cascade. All catalytic subunits of cyclic nucleotide PDEs contain two strictly conserved metal binding motifs, His-Asn-X-X-His (motif I) and His-Asp-X-X-His (motif II). In PDE6α′ these motifs are as follows:557His-Asn-Trp-Arg-His561 and597His-Asp-Ile-Asp-His601. The crucial role of the metal ions and the binding motifs for PDE catalytic activity has been recently supported by a crystallographic study of the PDE4 catalytic domain (20Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Rather than forming separate metal binding sites, both motifs are involved in coordination of two bound metal ions, ME1 and ME2 (20Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). For example, ME1, most likely a tightly bound Zn2+, is coordinated by the His residue (His561of PDE6α′) from motif I, and the His and Asp residues from motif II (His597-Asp598). A model of cAMP docked in the PDE4 active site demonstrates that ME1 and ME2 bind the cyclic phosphate, position a potential water molecule for the nucleophilic attack, and would serve to stabilize the transition state (20Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In view of the role of metal binding sites in hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotides, we have considered the motifs I and II as probable structural determinants of the catalytic properties of PDE6. Motifs I and II are practically identical in PDE5 and PDE6. Therefore, a spatial orientation of these sites might be a potential key factor for cGMP hydrolysis. Motif I comprises the N-terminal potion of the helix-α6, and motif II is in the loop connecting helices 7 and 8. A PDE5/PDE6α′ chimera, Chi20, was generated by replacing a PDE6α′ domain containing helices α6-α8 into PDE5. The analysis of Chi20 revealed a more than 10-fold increase in the maximal catalytic rate accompanied by a ∼5-fold increase in the K m value. Subsequent chimeric PDE, Chi21, containing only helix α6 of PDE6α′ displayed catalytic properties similar to those of Chi20. An alignment of sequences of photoreceptor PDEs and PDE5 corresponding to the helix-α6 shows a high degree of homology with the notable exception of residues at two positions corresponding to PDE6α′ Gly562 and Gly566. Gly562 of PDE6α′ is conserved only in the PDE6 family, but substituted by Ala in PDE5 (Fig. 3 A). Importantly, Gly562immediately follows His561 from motif I. His561, by analogy to PDE4, is involved in coordination of ME1, and in the positioning of His557 to accomplish the protonation of the O3′ leaving group (20Xu R.X. Hassell A.M. Vanderwall D. Lambert M.H. Holmes W.D. Luther M.A. Rocque W.J. Milburn M.V. Zhao Y. Ke H. Nolte R.T. Science. 2000; 288: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To probe the role of the Gly residues, a doubly substituted PDE5 mutant, A608G/A612G, has been made. The k cat value of the A608G/A612G mutant was comparable with those of Chi20 and Chi21, and ∼10-fold higher then that of PDE5. These results suggest that the Gly residues are in part responsible for the catalytic characteristics of PDE6. Most likely, they allow for a positioning of motif I that is most favorable for cGMP hydrolysis. Other yet to be defined determinants contribute to the unique catalytic power of PDE6, because the achievedk cat value is still ∼40–50-fold lower thank cat described for native activated PDE6. Overall, our results suggest that a progressive incorporation of PDE6 domains or residues into PDE5 not only allows a structure-function analysis of PDE6, but also represents a realistic approach to generate a chimeric enzyme that would be functionally indistinguishable from PDE6.
