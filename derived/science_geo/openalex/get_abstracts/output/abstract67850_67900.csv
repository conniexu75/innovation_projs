https://openalex.org/W1533618603,"Hysteretic enzymes are defined as those enzymes which respond slowly (in terms of some kinetic characteristic) to a rapid change in ligand, either substrate or modifier, concentration. Such slow changes, defined in terms of their rate relative to the over-all catalytic reaction, result in a lag in the response of the enzyme to changes in the ligand level. Several mechanisms, including ligand-induced isomerization of the enzyme, displacement of tightly bound ligands by other ligands, or polymerization and depolymerization, are discussed and it can be shown that the description of the time-dependent change in enzyme activity is similar for many different cases. Examination of the literature reveals that a large number of enzymes may fall into the category termed hysteretic, that such enzymes are frequently those which are important in metabolic regulation, that the time of conversion from one kinetic form to another may vary between seconds and minutes, and that there are experimental examples of all the mechanisms which are discussed theoretically. The possible relation between those enzymes which are hysteretic and regulation of complex metabolic processes is discussed in terms of the fact that the slow response of the hysteretic enzyme to changes in ligand level will lead to a time-dependent buffering of some metabolites and that this may be important with respect to pathways which utilize common intermediates or in which there are multiple branch points. It is suggested that the question of hysteresis in enzyme systems as defined here be systematically investigated in regulatory enzymes and that this concept may be of value in discussing the regulation of complex processes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2073133399,"Abstract 1. Eight different substances were isolated in crystalline forms by ion exchange chromatography of the aliphatic basic amino acid fraction of human urine. 2. Structures of guanidino-N,N-dimethylarginine and guanidino-N,N'-dimethylarginine were assigned for two substances by analyses of the degradation products, elemental compositions, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The identities of the compounds were confirmed by synthesis followed by comparison of infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and of chromatographic properties with those of the isolated compounds. The concentrations of these two compounds in human urine are higher than that of arginine. Their natural occurrence has not been reported previously. 3. Three compounds, Ne-methyl-, Ne,Ne-dimethyl-, and Ne,Ne,Ne-trimethyllysine, were identified by elementary analyses and syntheses. Occurrence of the last two compounds in free state in nature has not been reported previously. 4. Two compounds, glucosylgalactosyl- and galactosyl-δ-hydroxylysine, whose occurrence in human urine has been reported previously, were isolated as crystals for the first time. 5. The concentrations of these N-methyl derivatives of lysine and arginine in the urine were not changed by oral loading of either lysine or arginine. Protein-free diet did not affect the amounts of these compounds in urine. The possibility that these compounds are derived from tissue proteins in which lysine and arginine residues are methylated was discussed."

Purified tritiated 5S RNA was annealed to the DNA of polytene chromosomes, which had been denatured in formamide. The 5S RNA genes are placed within the region 56E-F of the right arm of chromosome 2. This localization was determined from autoradiographs, where the radioactivity from hybrids of [(3)H]RNA and DNA was confined to the 56E-F segment."
https://openalex.org/W1585039069,"Abstract The active cysteine of papain was labeled with 14C-iodoacetate and the cystine residues were reduced and coupled with unlabeled iodoacetate. The heptacarboxymethyl papain was then maleyalated and hydrolyzed with trypsin. Key peptides were isolated from this hydrolysate which have permitted completion of the amino acid sequence of the protein. Thus, an earlier tentative and incomplete version of this sequence has been corrected and shown to be in accord with the studies of Drenth et al. (Drenth, J., Jansonius, J. N., Koekoek, R., Swen, H. M., and Wolthers, B. G., Nature, 218, 929 (1968)) by x-ray crystallographic methods."
https://openalex.org/W2016138834,"The HL-A7 antigen of human leukocytes occurs as a soluble, low-density lipoprotein in the serum of HL-A7-positive individuals. Its presence in high concentration may inhibit direct leukocyte grouping, leading to erroneous results. This finding affords an easy method for the preparation of monospecific cytotoxic antiserums by absorption with serum fractions rather than leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1613415979,"Abstract When desialylated ceruloplasmin (ASCPN), labeled with 64Cu and with 3H in its galactose residues, is injected intravenously into a rat, more than half of the radioactivity can be recovered within minutes in ASCPN precipitated immunochemically from liver homogenates. Both radioautographic studies and measurements of hepatic uptake of ASCPN following blockade of the reticuloendothelial system indicate that ASCPN enters only hepatocytes. Serial measurements on the immunoprecipitated ASCPN indicate that cleavage of 64Cu is 80% complete within 30 min of injection, whereas galactose is split from the protein even faster. Sucrose gradient fractionation of liver homogenates from rats treated with Triton WR 1339 or dextran reveals the principal site of the catabolic cleavage of copper and galactose to be lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1486169825,"Abstract Two factors, M1 and M2, isolated from a 0.5 m KCl reticulocyte ribosomal wash fraction by diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography, are required for a lowering of the concentration optimum for polyuridylic acid-dependent polypeptide synthesis (the Mg++ shift). These factors have been separated from the polypeptide chain elongation factors T1 and T2. M1 is capable of binding phenylalanyl-tRNA and N-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA to washed reticulocyte ribosomes at low concentration, yet it cannot substitute for T1 in peptide chain elongation. It appears, therefore, that M1 may be functioning at a ribosomal site distinct from the aminoacyl site."
https://openalex.org/W1586027043,"Abstract In order to clarify the reaction mechanism of l-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (l-tryptophan:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.13.1.12), a hemoprotein, spectral and kinetic studies were carried out with highly purified enzyme preparations from Pseudomonas fluorescens (ATCC 11299). A new spectrally distinct species of the enzyme heme (λmax; 418, 545, and 580 mµ) was observed during the steady state of the catalytic reaction. The formation of the new spectral species was absolutely dependent on the simultaneous presence of both oxygen and l-tryptophan with the ferrous enzyme. In the absence of l-tryptophan, the ferrous heme in the enzyme was oxidized to a ferric state by molecular oxygen. Available evidence indicated that the observed spectrum was due to a ternary complex of oxygen, the enzyme, and l-tryptophan and represented the oxygenated form. By means of rapid reaction spectrophotometry, the oxygenated form was shown to be an obligatory intermediate of the reaction. The rate of the over-all reaction, as judged by the accumulation of l-formylkynurenine, was always proportional to the amount of the oxygenated form present during the entire course of the reaction. The rate constant for the decomposition of the oxygenated form was estimated to be 19 sec-1, which agreed well with the turnover number of the enzyme (18 sec-1). The rate constant for the binding of oxygen with the ferrous enzyme in the presence of l-tryptophan and that for the reverse reaction were also determined to be 5 x 106 m-1 sec-1 and 230 sec-1, respectively. Thus, the binding of oxygen with the ferrous enzyme in the presence of l-tryptophan is a reversible process, as are those with hemoglobin and myoglobin. Some properties of the Pseudomonas enzyme are also described."
https://openalex.org/W1533024659,"Abstract The rate and extent of GTP hydrolysis by a molar excess of ribosomes and G factor (the soluble translocation protein) are unaffected by fusidic acid. When the nucleotide substrate level is increased to exceed the macromolecular components, there is a burst of fusidic acid-resistant hydrolysis approximately equivalent to the molar amount of G factor when ribosomes are present in excess. Neither ribosomes nor G factor alone is capable of catalyzing even 1 eq of GTP hydrolysis. Several methods were used to show that at initial GTP concentrations as low as 10-8 m (the lowest level of discrimination) essentially all of the nucleotide, as GDP, is in the form of a ternary complex with ribosomes and G factor in the presence of fusidic acid. The binding of the reaction product, GDP, is also stabilized by the antibiotic. Furthermore, the preliminary binding of unlabeled GDP prevents the subsequent binding of labeled GTP. This is in contrast to the case with equimolar amounts of GMP and the GTP analogue, guanylyl methylene diphosphonate, neither of which under these conditions prevents the subsequent binding of GTP despite the fact that the analogue is a competitive inhibitor of GTP in translocation. The following mechanism is proposed for the uncoupled hydrolysis of GTP by the ribosome and G factor to account for these and previous observations: [see PDF for equation] [see PDF for equation] [see PDF for equation]"

The cyanogen bromide peptides were fractionated on Sephadex G-50 and further purified by rechromatography on Sephadex G-50 or paper electrophoresis at pH 1.9. They contained a total of 239 amino acid residues. Tryptic peptides of each of the cyanogen bromide peptides were purified and their amino acid composition was determined. The order of these peptides in each cyanogen bromide peptide and the order of the cyanogen bromide peptides in enterotoxin B were established. Based on the information from tryptic, chymotryptic, and cyanogen bromide peptides, the complete amino acid sequence of enterotoxin B was established. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B is a single polypeptide chain containing 239 amino acid residues."
https://openalex.org/W1523307235,"Abstract The earlier resolution of preparations of bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease into two active fractions by chromatography on sulfoethyl-Sephadex has been improved through the use of columns of phosphocellulose. Gradient elution with sodium acetate at pH 4.7 shows the presence of at least four forms of the enzyme. The principal component (DNase A) is accompanied by Fractions B and C, and, in very minor amount, D; all four fractions possess comparable specific activities. Pancreatic juice contains DNases which are chromatographically indistinguishable from the A, B, and C components extracted from the tissue. The three main fractions (A, B, and C present in the extracted enzyme in the molar proportions 4:1:1) were analyzed for amino acids, terminal residues, and carbohydrates. All three proteins have NH2-terminal leucine, COOH-terminal threonine, and carbohydrate attached at a single position. DNases A and B have the same amino acid composition, but the B fraction differs from A (which possesses 2 N-acetylglucosamine and 6 mannose residues) in that it contains predominantly a DNase with 1 residue each of sialic acid and galactose in addition to 3 N-acetylglucosamine and 5 mannose residues. DNase C is similar to A in possessing a neutral carbohydrate moiety (2 N-acetylglucosamine and 5 mannose) but the protein contains 1 less histidine residue and 1 more proline residue than DNase A or B. Pancreatic tissue thus synthesizes DNases which vary in the carbohydrate side chain and in amino acid sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1980915534,Grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) attacks resulting in human injury and known to have occurred in the national parks of North America were examined. Fifty-seven attacks in which 61 persons were injured took place in three national parks in the United States and accounted for 79 percent of the known injuries. The remaining 16 injuries occurred in four Canadian national parks. The 77 injured persons gives an injury rate of 1 person per 2 million visitors.
https://openalex.org/W1529325504,"1. The characteristics of mucin synthesis in the small intestine have been studied by following the incorporation of [1-14C]glucosamine into acid-precipitable lipid-free material from intestinal mucosal subfractions and from the intestinal lumen. 2. This material contains carbohydrates characteristic of glycoproteins and lacks hexuronic acid which is characteristically present in acid mucopolysaccharides. Intestinal mucins, therefore, appear to be glycoproteins. 3. Following injection of [1-14C]glucosamine in vivo, specific radioactivity peaks are obtained in the glycoprotein hexosamine of the microsomes at 30 min, the mitochondria at 60 min, the brush border at 90 min, and luminal secretions at 150 min. The most highly labeled hexosamine fractions are found in brush border and luminal glycoproteins after 90 min. 4. Incubation in vitro of intestinal slices derived from rats labeled in vivo with [1-14-C]glucosamine indicates that the highly labeled luminal glycoprotein is derived from mitochondrial and cell sap compartments. A probable precursor of the highly labeled luminal glycoprotein has been identified in the cell sap by column chromatography on Sepharose 4B. 5. The low specific radioactivity of cell sap glycoprotein hexosamine results from the presence of a poorly labeled glycoprotein of large molecular weight. The poorly labeled glycoprotein has been separated from the highly labeled glycoprotein in the cell sap by Sepharose 4B chromatography. It contains approximately 69% of the hexosamine in cell sap glycoproteins, and does not appear in intestinal secretions."
https://openalex.org/W1599640089,"Abstract The reaction [see PDF for equation] is catalyzed by microsomal enzymes of preputial gland tumors. The data show that the oxygen of 18O-labeled hexadecanol is incorporated into O-alkyl lipids in vitro and in vivo. The experiment in vivo with Ehrlich ascites cells also revealed that the oxygen of the O-alk-1-enyl bond originates from the fatty alcohol. The most prominent peak showing the presence of 18O in the mass spectra of the acetates of the 18O-hexadecanol (94% 18O) used as the precursor was at m/e 61. [see PDF for equation] The isopropylidene derivatives of the biosynthetic 18O-hexadecylglycerol had a molecular peak at m/e 358 of low intensity, but removal of a methyl group by fragmentation produced resonance-stabilized oxonium ions containing 18O at m/e 343 of high intensity. Except for relative intensities, the hydrogenated 18O-hexadec-1-enylglycerol synthesized in vivo had a mass spectrum identical with that of the 18O-hexadecylglycerol produced in vitro or in vivo. The 18O content of the O-alkylglycerols biosynthesized was 89% (in vitro) and 34% (in vivo) and that of the O-alk-1-enylglycerol was 16% (in vivo)."
https://openalex.org/W1565692405,"Abstract Pyridoxal kinase catalyzes the formation of pyridoxal phosphate, a coenzyme required for many metabolic reactions. A 2000-fold purification of the enzyme from bovine brain has been achieved by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, gel filtration, and affinity chromatography. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 9.5 and 7.5 indicates that the final product is 70 to 75% homogeneous. From sedimentation equilibrium analysis, the highly purified preparation appears to be monodisperse, and a molecular weight estimate of 80,000 has been made. A sharp pH optimum at pH 6.0 has been observed. Of the divalent metal ions studied, Zn+2 is the most effective in catalyzing the formation of pyridoxal phosphate from ATP and pyridoxal; the order of activation is Zn+2 g Co+2 g Mn+2 g Mg+2 g Fe+2. The stability constants for ZnHATP- and ZnATP-2 have been obtained at 0.3 ionic strength and 25° in the absence of Na+ or K+ by the pH titration method. The values are 1050 m-1 for ZnHATP- and 195,000 m-1 for ZnATP-2. An initial velocity study using pyridoxal as the variable substrate and ZnATP-2 as the fixed substrate gave a family of lines intersecting to the left of the vertical axis. Such an intersecting pattern is compatible with a sequential mechanism in which both pyridoxal and ZnATP-2 must add to the enzyme before pyridoxal phosphate or ADP is released."
https://openalex.org/W1530265562,"Abstract This paper describes a procedure which was designed to maximally inhibit the synthesis in vivo of all proteins except those synthesized in the mitochondria. To this end a 15-min preincubation of Neurospora crassa cells with 100 µg of cycloheximide per ml was employed before 14C-leucine was introduced. A small fraction of the protein synthesized by the whole cell (2.15%) was found to be completely resistant to inhibition by cycloheximide and sensitive to inhibition by chloramphenicol. The cycloheximide-resistant, chloramphenicol-sensitive protein-synthesizing system was shown to co-sediment with the mitochondrial fraction in cell homogenates fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. It was deduced that the mitochondria, in vivo, are the sites of cycloheximide-resistant protein synthesis. The protein they synthesize is equivalent to about 14.5% of the protein of the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial protein synthesis, in vivo, is over 100 times more rapid than the fastest rates yet reported in vitro and is linear for at least 30 min. As such, intramitochondrial protein synthesis in vivo offers the possibility of obtaining proteins of extremely high specific activity and may shed new light on the nature of the protein synthesized by the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W166881372,"Abstract Hybrid hemoglobins have been prepared containing manganese protoporphyrin IX in one type of hemoglobin subunit and iron protoporphyrin IX in the other type of hemoglobin subunit. These molecules are found to be tetrameric and show the optical absorption patterns of both metalloporphyrins. The manganese-containing subunits of these hybrids bind neither oxygen nor carbon monoxide, while the iron-containing subunits do. The oxygen affinities of the iron-containing subunits in these hybrids are lower than the affinities of the corresponding isolated hemoglobin subunits, although not as low as the affinity of native hemoglobin. The β subunits have the lower affinity in both the isolated and tetrameric states. This suggests a nonequivalence of oxygen-binding properties of the subunits in hemoglobin. The Hill coefficients for the hybrid hemoglobin oxygen equilibria indicate that a β-β subunit interaction may be present upon oxygen binding, and that it is stronger than an α-α subunit interaction, if in fact the latter exists at all. These manganese-containing hybrid hemoglobins appear to demonstrate a requirement for a prosthetic group to be present in each subunit in order that the proper configuration for lowered oxygen affinity be established in hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W2133461541,"Abstract Mouse mammary gland explants rapidly incorporated 14C-acetate into the F1, F2a1, F2a2, and F3 histones. These acetylated histones were divided into two classes which were distinguished by their metabolic stability, electrophoretic mobility, and sensitivity to cycloheximide. The acetylation of the F1 and F2a2 histones was inhibited by cycloheximide, occurred only during their synthesis, and was limited to the α-amino group of the terminal serine. In contrast, the preformed F3 and F2a1 were acetylated on the e-NH2 group of internal lysine residues. This acetate was unstable, and the histones were rapidly deacetylated. The F2b histone did not incorporate 14C-acetate. These results suggest that amino-terminal acetylation of the F1, F2a1, and F2a2 histones represents a mechanism of polypeptide chain initiation in eucaryotic cells analogous to aminoterminal formylation in procaryotic cells. If acetylation of histones has a functional role by modifying the DNA-histone interaction, it is reasonable to assume that this modification must also be reversible. Since the acetylation of both F1 and F2a2 histones occurs only during their synthesis, and this acetate remains with the stable histone, it is unlikely that these proteins function in a reversible DNA association. In contrast, both the F2a1 and F3 histone fractions are reversibly acetylated on preformed molecules, suggesting that acetylation of these proteins could function in the control of RNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1621628891,"Abstract Calcium transport by sarcotubular vesicles (fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum) from skeletal muscle of rats, rabbits, and humans follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics when studied in systems containing oxalate and low ratios of calcium to vesicle protein. Under these conditions different preparations of vesicles are characterized by their calcium concentrating ability, i.e. the constant level to which they lower the calcium concentration of the medium. Km and Vmax values for calcium transport by rat and human vesicles are now established, and the rates at which calcium leaks from vesicles at equilibrium are defined with the use of two different methods of studying exchange at equilibrium. Chlorpromazine, quinine, and quinidine are competitive inhibitors of calcium transport. Reduction of calcium to Michaelis-Menten kinetics should facilitate comparison of the calcium transport system in vesicles from various types of muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1531521092,"Abstract T4 phage lysozyme was partially hydrolyzed in dilute acid (pH 2) at 105°. By this treatment, hydrolysis occured mainly at the peptide bonds involving the NH2 and COOH groups of aspartic acid and asparagine residues in the protein. The peptide fragments thus obtained were purified by means of column chromatography, gel filtration, paper chromatography, and paper electrophoresis. In addition to free aspartic acid, leucine, valine, and glutamic acid, nine peptides were isolated and their complete or partial structures were determined. These peptides confirmed the linkages of tryptic peptides proposed on the basis of earlier studies with chymotryptic and peptic peptides. The primary structure of T4 phage lysozyme was thus established."
https://openalex.org/W1560310993,"Abstract Human peripheral blood lymphocytes in culture, carefully freed of contaminating platelets, incorporated glucosamine-1-14C at a low and constant rate. Following the addition of phytohemagglutinin, there was a doubling of the rate of incorporation within 3 hours, followed by a 10- to 20-fold stimulation by the 4th day of culture and a subsequent slow decrease to twice the control rate within 14 days. The glucosamine in the acid-soluble pool appeared mainly (84%) in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Incorporation, which was mainly into the membrane fractions separated by differential or isopycnic density gradient centrifugation, was inhibited by puromycin. Incorporated glucosamine was preferentially released from the intact lymphocyte by proteolytic digestion, and three different classes of glycopeptides were released by papain digestion of a purified membrane fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1511819578,"Amino acid analyses have been performed on the thyroglobulins from calf, sheep, pig, and man. These proteins contain approximately one-fifth of their amino acid residues in the form of dicarboxylic amino acids, almost one-half of these being in the amide form. The basic amino acids account for about 10% of the total amino acids. Other prominent amino acids in the thyroglobulins are serine, leucine, alanine, and glycine, and there is a substantial amount of half-cystine present, representing approximately 250 moles per mole of protein. The amino acids, which number close to 5500 per molecule, account for 87 to 91% of the weight of the proteins, the remainder being made up of 8 to 10% of carbohydrate (approximately 300 monosac-charide residues per molecule) and iodine. The terminal amino acids of the four thyroglobulins have been investigated. Amino-terminal amino acid analysis by the fluorodinitrobenzene method has indicated the presence of 2 residues of dinitrophenyl-aspartic acid per molecule. A third terminal position appears to be occupied by leucine in the sheep and calf proteins, by glycine in the pig, and by serine in the human. Each protein, in addition, has partial residues of several dinitrophenyl-amino acids which account for another mole of terminal residues per mole of protein. These findings would be consistent with the presence of four peptide chains in the thyroglobulin molecule. Carboxyl-terminal amino acid analyses, performed by hydrazinolysis, resulted in the release of 2 to 3 moles of amino acids per mole of protein after 8 hours of treatment. These amino acids included serine, glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, and leucine. Longer exposure to hydrazine was not possible because of the considerable hydrolytic cleavage of amino acid hydrazides or of peptide bonds which occurred, as evaluated by hydrazine treatment of the methylated protein. Carboxypeptidase digestion led to the release of a limited number of amino acids, most prominent among them being leucine and serine."
https://openalex.org/W1523422925,"Abstract Luteinizing hormone containing 8.9 NIH-LH-S1 units per mg was isolated from human pituitary glands by isoelectric focusing in a sucrose gradient containing carrier ampholytes. Approximately 88% of the starting units was recovered, suggesting no apparent loss or inactivation of the hormone activity during isolation procedures. The luteinizing hormone showed a single protein band in acrylamide disc electrophoresis and a single precipitin band in immunoelectrophoresis with antisera to luteinizing hormone and to human chorionic gonadotropin. The luteinizing hormone did not cross-react with antisera to follicle-stimulating hormone or to serum proteins. The hormone sedimented as a single boundary in the ultracentrifuge with an s20,w of 2.31 S. A Stokes radius of 28.5 A and a molecular weight of 26,750 were calculated for the luteinizing hormone. Amino acid analysis revealed a high content of proline. Serine was detected at the COOH terminus. The luteinizing hormone was devoid of follicle-stimulating hormone activity; however, it contained 0.1 USP-TSH unit per mg."
https://openalex.org/W1558573675,"Previous reports demonstrated that synthetic polytripeptides of the structure (Pro-Pro-Gly)10, prepared with a specific modification of the Merrifield technique, formed triple helical structures in aqueous solution which were similar to the triple helical structures of tropocollagen. The studies presented here were undertaken in order to answer the question of whether the individual polytripeptide chains within the triple helices were packed in a parallel fashion similar to vertebrate collagen or in an antiparallel fashion similar to the structure which has been suggested for collagen from the cuticle of the round worm, Ascaris lumbricoides. It was found that electrostatic interactions between the COOH-terminal and NH-terminal groups of (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 could be used to probe the detailed structure of triple helices formed by the polytripeptide. Titration of (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 in triple helical conformation indicated that the pK of the NH-terminal group was 0.59 units lower than the pK for the same group in nonhelical (Pro-Pro-Gly)5. The titration of the NH-terminal group of helical (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 was significantly broader than the theoretically predicted curve, and the pK increased after the polytripeptide was heated and quenched. Furthermore, the melting curve for the helix coil transition of (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 was changed by protonation of the NH-terminal or COOH-terminal groups. The Tm for the dipolar ion form was about 10° lower than for either the fully protonated or unprotonated forms of the helical polytripeptide. The results indicate that in the triple helical structure formed by (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 the three chains are in register and parallel."
https://openalex.org/W1508967973,"SUMMARY Dagg, Coleman, and Fraser (Genetics, 49, 979 (1964)) first described a mutation in C57B1/6 mice that resulted in a 3-fold decrease in the capacity of the intact animal, or liver homogenates, to degrade uracil to ,8-alanine, COZ, and am- monia when compared to Rf/J mice. We have examined the mechanism for this metabolic defect by assaying sepa- rately the three enzymes involved in pyrimidine degradation in mouse liver in mouse strain Rf/up, from which Rf/J was derived. The three enzymes, dihydrouracil dehydrogenase, dihydropyrimidinase, and fi-ureidopropionase, are readily separable by diethylaminoethylcellulose chromatography, indicating that the metabolic defect is not the result of a mutation in a single protein with multiple enzymatic activi- ties. Assays of each of the three enzymes separately indi- cate that only the last enzyme of the pathway, P-ureidopro- pionase, is defective in the C57B1/6 strain. This activity in C57B1/6 is 16% of the activity of the Rf/up strain. The mutation most likely affects the structure of the enzyme, since enzyme partially purified from C57B1/6 is more thermo- labile, and has a decreased affinity for substrate than enzyme from Rf/up mice. The P-ureidopropionase has a hereto- fore unrecognized requirement for sulfhydryl reduction for maximal activity. The results indicate that the activity of this enzyme is rate- limiting for the over-all degradation of pyrimidines to /3- alanine in liver of both mouse strains. Several recent studies from this laboratory have explored the use of inbred mouse strains as a source of mutations for studying enzyme regulation in higher organisms. In one study, Ganschow and Schimke (1) showed that independent mutations among closely related C57Bl strains affected the catalytic activity and rate constant of degradation of hepatic catalase. In another study, Doyle and Schimke (2) showed that a mutat,ion first studied by Coleman (3) affected the amount of &aminolevulinate dehydratase by regulating the rate of specific enzyme synthesis without affecting the rate constant of degradation. These studies, then, indicate that inbred mouse strains can provide a * This research was supported by Grant P-427 from the Amer- ican Cancer Society and by Grant GM-14931 from the United States Public Health Service. wealth of material for the study regulation specific enzyme metabolism in mammals. One of the most interesting and potentially important muta- tions in inbred mouse strains is that described in 1964 by Dagg, Coleman, and Fraser (4) which involves the degradation of pyrimidines by the three enzyme pathway depicted in Fig. 1, a pathway studied in a number of laboratories (5-8). Dagg et al. (4) found that Rf/J mice were capable of converting injected 14C-2-uracil to 14C02 at a rate three times that of C57Bl/6 mice and determined that this capacity was regulated by two alleles at a single locus with codominant inheritance properties. Using substrates labeled with 1% in position C-2 of uracil, dihydro- uracil, and the ureido carbon of ureidopropionic acid, and deter- mining evolution of 14C02 in crude liver extracts, they concluded that all three enzymes in the pathway were diminished 3- to 8-fold in the C57B1/6 relative to Rf/J. Such a mutation is particularly important, since it would represent a single muta- tion affecting all enzymes of a given pathway, and as such would represent evidence based on mutants of an operon in animal tissues. Because of its potential importance we have under- taken a more extensive study of the biochemical basis of the mutation. We have developed sensitive assays which assay each enzyme separately, rather than depend on each subsequent enzyme in the pathway (see Fig. 1) as did Dagg et al. (4). We have found that only the last enzyme of the pathway, fi-ureido- propionase, is affected by the mutation. It is most likely that the mutation affects the structure of the enzyme, since the en- zyme from the C5761/6 mice is more thermolabile, and has a higher apparent"
https://openalex.org/W1651485329,"Abstract Incubation of pure yeast phenylalanine transfer RNA with high levels of ribonuclease T1 at 37° in 20 mm MgCl2 leads initially to the production of a 3' three-quarter-molecule and a 5' quarter-molecule as a result of rapid cleavage in the dihydrouridine loop. Subsequently, scission in the ribothymidine loop occurs, generating 3' quarter-molecules and half-molecules; the latter comprise the central half of the molecule extending from the dihydrouridine loop to the ribothymidine loop. The identity of these fragments was established by column fingerprinting of the oligonucleotides produced by complete digestion with ribonuclease T1. The central half-molecule, the 5' quarter-molecule, and the 3' quarter-molecule can be reannealed to form an aggregate the size of intact tRNA as judged by Sephadex G-100 chromatography. This reconstituted tRNAphe can be charged to approximately 20% with phenylalanine by partially purified phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase despite the cleavages in the dihydrouridine and ribothymidine loops, thus indicating that these loops need not be intact for enzyme recognition. Neither individual fragments nor aggregates with large sections of the tRNA missing could be aminoacylated."
https://openalex.org/W1530530441,Abstract Biotin administration to biotin-deficient rats enhanced protein synthesis. Time sequence studies indicated that RNA synthesis was stimulated as early as 1 hour after biotin administration to the deficient rat. The synthesis of RNA of liver was stimulated by biotin administration. Nuclear RNA isolated from biotin-injected rats was more active in a protein-synthesizing system in vitro than a similar preparation from the deficient rat liver. It is suggested that biotin has a role in the synthesis of RNA.
https://openalex.org/W1542226198,"Abstract The initiation of DNA synthesis in vitro by the Micrococcus luteus DNA polymerase was studied with a combination of density- and radioactive-labeled substrates and templates. Product DNA is covalently linked to the template (primer) DNA. Even after 4-fold net replication, the newly synthesized products are not separable from the template (primer) molecules. Replication of poly d(T-G)·poly d(C-A) was studied to elucidate the details of the synthesis reaction. These experiments indicate that, during the course of synthesis, the polymerase reverses its direction of translocation and uses the newly synthesized product as a template for further synthesis. Apparently, the complementary strands of the product DNA are covalently joined by hairpin loop structures. The repair of single stranded DNA's is completely dependent on the presence of primer molecules that are complementary to the template. The M. luteus DNA polymerase is apparently unable to initiate the synthesis of new polynucleotide strands, as judged by the inability to incorporate β-γ-32P-labeled triphosphates or 3H-labeled monophosphates into polymer termini. Thus, this enzyme replicates a DNA template by adding nucleotides onto the ends of primer molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2039519672,Comparisons between sibling and parent-child pairs with unrelated control pairs matched for year of birth and parental education were made to determine the relative heritability of the general level of intelligence quotient as opposed to that of the sequential pattern of IQ change over age (3 to 12 years). There was greater similarity among related siblings relative to matched controls for general level than for pattern of IQ over age. Relationships between the IQ's of children and that of their parents as children were not consistent across age.
https://openalex.org/W1681194655,"Abstract Comparisons with the distribution of intramitochondrial marker enzymes have indicated that kynurenine aminotransferase is present in the inner membrane fraction of rat liver mitochondria. It appears to be weakly bound to the inner membrane because it is easily solubilized by increasing the concentration of digitonin. With the use of α-ketoglutarate or oxalacetate as amino group acceptor, the aminotransferase has been found to transaminate 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine as well as l-kynurenine."
https://openalex.org/W1953792099,"A total of 38 peptides have been isolated from a trypsin digest of T4 phage lysozyme by the methods of column and paper chromatography and paper electrophoresis. A determination of the amino acid sequence of 26 of these peptides accounts for a total of 164 amino acid residues in the lysozyme. Utilizing information obtained from the other incompletely digested peptides, i.e. those which contain two tryptic peptides or more, it has been possible to reassemble the data to represent 20 unique fragments of this enzyme."

It was confirmed that the potential difference is negative in the vicinity of greatest excitation, and it was discovered that in the same region the overall potential level is positive."
https://openalex.org/W1505270534,"Succinyl phosphate reacts rapidly and nonenzymatically with coenzyme A in the pH range 3 to 8 to yield coenzyme A. This hitherto unsuspected reaction of an acyl phosphate with a thiol depends critically on the presence within the molecule of a free carboxyl group, which bears a succinyl relationship—and is spatially accessible—to the phosphorylated carboxyl. The free carboxyl group interacts with the anhydride portion of the molecule at neutral pH and below. A variety of kinetic experiments point to the cyclic form of phosphate as the immediate reactant with coenzyme A in the synthesis of coenzyme A. The somewhat unorthodox mechanism which is proposed is not to be taken as proved. Succinyl phosphate and its congeners exhibit characteristic pH rate profiles of hydrolysis, which are unmistakably distinct in their contour from those of acyl phosphates which are unreactive with coenzyme A. During hydrolysis at neutral pH and below, phosphate may also react in a cyclic form, possibly as succinic anhydride following elimination of orthophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1485114891,"Abstract Cyclized α-tetrasubstituted substrates, 1-keto-3-methyl-3-carbomethoxytetrahydroisoquinoline, designated as Compound II-C, and methyl 3-methyl-3,4-dihydroisocoumarin-3-carboxylate, designated as Compound II-D, are hydrolyzed by α-chymotrypsin readily and highly stereospecifically in the R-D sense, kcat/Km = 1.8/0.0054 = 330 m-1 sec-1 and 2.7/0.0083 = 320 m-1 sec-1, respectively. The results indicate that d-cyclized substrates associate with the enzyme with the hetero ring at the α-hydrogen position, (h); the α-tetrasubstituted cyclized compounds place the α-methyl group at the l-α-acetamido site. Compounds II-C and II-D are less reactive by factors of 60 and 70 than the corresponding α-trisubstituted cyclized substrates. Factors of 9 and 20, respectively, may arise from the effect of the α-methyl group on the nonenzymic hydrolytic reactivity. The remaining factors are due to minor effects of the methyl group on Km. Noncyclized α-tetrasubstituted substrates, methyl N-acetyl-α-methyl-phenylalaninate, designated as Compound I-C, and methyl α-methyl-α-acetoxy-β-phenylpropionate, designated as Compound I-E, are inert to α-chymotrypsin, largely because they may place neither α substituent readily at h. However RS methyl α-methyl-β-phenyllactate, designated as Compound I-D, is a noncyclized α-tetrasubstituted compound which is hydrolyzed by α-chymotrypsin, kcat/ Km = 0.47/0.014 = 35 m-1 sec-1. It is hydrolyzed preferentially in the R-D sense like the cyclized compounds because, of the two α substituents, the α-hydroxyl is better accommodated at h. Interaction at the h part of the active site is with methionine 192. Absolute configurations of α-tetrasubstituted cyclized compounds are assigned by the proposed orientation in the active site and by optical rotatory dispersion correlations. Configurations of I-D and II-D are correlated by stereospecific conversion of I-D to II-D."
https://openalex.org/W1549819529,"Abstract A procedure was developed to alkylate the cysteine involved in the µ-chain bond joining the 8 S subunits of 19 S γM-globulins. The method used permitted the interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds in reduced IgM to re-form and the intersubunit sulfhydryl groups to be specifically alkylated with 1-14C-iodoacetamide. A minimally labeled subunit containing 3.4 moles of S-carboxamidomethylcysteine per 200,000 g did not dissociate significantly into heavy and light chains in 8 m urea. Heavy chains isolated from this subunit contained about 95% of the radioactive label. After tryptic digestion of the µ-chain, about two-thirds of the label was found in a large glycopeptide. Most of the label in this material was found in a chymotryptic tetradecapeptide product of it. This latter peptide isolated from four macroglobulins had identical amino acid composition and peptide mapping characteristics. The sequence of it is: Ser-Ala-Val-Gly-Glu-Ala-Ser-Ile-Cys-Glu-Asp-Asn-Asn-Trp A second µ-chain peptide with relatively low specific activity has a composition similar to that reported for the region of µ-chains which contains the half-cystine which forms the disulfide bond which joins the light chain. No radioactivity was found in the S-carboxamidomethylcysteine liberated by carboxypeptidase A treatment from radiolabeled µ-chain. This indicates that the intersubunit bond is not formed by a cysteine residue penultimate to the carboxyl terminus of µ-chains as previously suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1678241784,"Abstract The enzyme catalyzing the formation of 5-hydroxy-N-methylpyroglutamate has been purified. This enzyme is inactivated by a number of sulfhydryl reagents; however, this inactivation can be prevented by 0.10 m α-ketoglutarate, but not by 0.20 m methylamine. The enzymatic reaction is specific for α-ketoglutarate but a number of primary amines can replace methylamine as substrates for the enzyme. The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of 5-hydroxy-N-methylpyroglutamate is proportional to enzyme over a very narrow range of protein concentration, and the amount of enzyme required to saturate the system is dependent on the substrate concentration. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that N-methyl-α-ketoglutaramate, rather than 5-hydroxy-N-methylpyroglutamate, is the true product of the enzymatic reaction. Measurements of 5-hydroxy-N-methylpyroglutamate formation in the presence of n-propylamine or ethylamine result in alternate substrate inhibition patterns which are consistent with an ordered sequential kinetic mechanism. The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolyses of N-methyl-α-ketoglutaramate and a substrate analogue, α-ketoglutaramate, are noncompetitively inhibited by methylamine when α-keto-glutarate release is used to measure these reactions. However, no inhibition is observed if ammonia release is used as an assay. The decrease in α-ketoglutarate release can be quantitatively accounted for by the formation of 5-hydroxy-N-methylpyroglutamate. These results are consistent with the rate-limiting formation of an α-ketoglutaryl enzyme intermediate."

The isolated peptides were further purified by paper chromatography and electrophoresis. The amino acid composition and sequence of each purified peptide were determined. A total of 239 amino acid residues was found to be present in the tryptic peptides.

Evidence is presented which indicates that 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole is also an important metabolite of thiamine in the rat.

https://openalex.org/W1493222085,"Abstract The possibility has been examined that thyroxine may be degraded by an intermediate free radical in the oxidation of linoleate catalyzed by lipoxidase. Such a reaction has been observed and the lipid radical with which thyroxine reacts is suggested to be enzyme attached RO2 proposed by Tappel (in W. O. Lundberg (Editor), Autoxidation and antioxidants, Vol. I, Interscience Publishers, New York, 1961, p. 325). A similar reaction has been inferred to occur during thyroxine degradation by peroxidizing microsomal lecithin. Although thyroxine serves as an antioxidant during autoxidation of lecithin, it was predicted that a similar reaction with enzyme-bound RO2 might not influence oxidation rate or extent. The results bear out the prediction. The purpose of this and prior studies of thyroxine degradation in systems in vitro has been to investigate the mechanism of reaction of thyroxine with biological materials. In light of recent studies of the mechanism of deiodination of iodoaryl compounds, it is suggested that the lipid radical RO2 might either initiate degradation by electron abstraction or react with a terminal product of thyroxine after deiodination. The enabling property of thyroxine making these reactions probable is its predicted capacity to take up, transiently hold, and yield electrons."
https://openalex.org/W1538694635,"Abstract Oxidized and reduced carboxymethylated enterotoxin B was digested with chymotrypsin. The peptides were fractionated on AG1-X2 and Dowex 50W-X2, and further purified by paper chromatography and electrophoresis. A total of 67 pure peptides was isolated and their sequences were determined completely or partially. These peptides provide important overlaps of tryptic peptides previously isolated and sequenced. Since most of the overlaps involve only a single residue, the complete primary structure of enterotoxin B could not be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1557993158,"Abstract Gluconokinase from a pseudomonad has been purified to homogeneity by the criteria of sedimentation equilibrium and agarose gel electrophoresis. Ultracentrifugal analyses indicate a molecular weight of 112,000 and an s20,w of 7.0. The enzyme activity is lost rapidly in the presence of p-mercuribenzoate and more slowly in the presence of disulfides such as oxidized glutathione and carboxymethyldisulfide. Neither of the substrates or products of the reaction offer any protection against p-mercuribenzoate inactivation. Gluconate and ATP both offer protection against heat inactivation, whereas ADP renders the enzyme very labile to elevated temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W942610211,"ATP is required for the occurrence of K+-selective alkali metal cation efflux induced by nigericin from mitochondria exposed to valinomycin-like ionophores in the presence of acetate. Neither glutamate or succinate nor ADP, a phosphonic analogue of ATP and other nucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphates, substitutes for ATP. Dianemycin requires ATP + succinate to cause the efflux of K+ but not Li+ from mitochondria. The inorganic Pi released from ATP is responsible for the effects ascribed to the nucleotide. The proton movements which accompany Pi or acetate translocation may determine the selectivity of the alkali metal cation fluxes catalyzed by carboxylic antibiotics in intact mitochondria. ADP, a phosphonic analogue of ATP and nucleoside mono-, di- and triphosphates, counteracts the action of ATP on the transport of ions catalyzed by ionophorous antibiotics. The effectiveness of the nucleotides as inhibitors depends on the number of phosphoryl residues in the order: NTP g NDP g NMP. Nucleosides and free nitrogenated bases are inactive. General chemical structure also plays a role since thymidine, inosine, uridine, and guanosine nucleotides are more effective inhibitors than cytidine nucleotides. Neither the hydrolysis of ATP linked to cation transport nor the uptake into mitochondria of inorganic Pi energized by ATP is prevented by the nucleotides. A regulatory role of the nucleotides in the control of membrane structure, and thus of cation and H+ translocation, is suggested. The regulatory role of the nucleotides would be unrelated to their direct participation as phosphoryl acceptors in oxidative phosphorylation."
