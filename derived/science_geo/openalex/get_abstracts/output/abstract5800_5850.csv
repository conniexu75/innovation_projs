The subjects received methscopolamine prior to both arecholine and placebo injections. Conversely, scopolamine (0.5 milligram), a cholinergic antagonist, impaired learning and this impairment was reversed by arecholine and choline and the impairment after scopolamine were inversely proportional to the subject's performance on placebo; that is, ""poor"" performers were more vulnerable to both the enhancing effect of cholinergic agonist and precursor and the impairment after cholinergic antagonist than ""good"" performers."

https://openalex.org/W2088253893,Nineteen normal male subjects received 1.0 milligram of physostigmine or 1.0 milligram of saline by a slow intravenous infusion on two nonconsecutive days. Physostigmine significantly enhanced storage of information into long-term memory. Retrieval of information from long-term memory was also improved. Short-term memory processes were not significantly altered by physostigmine.
https://openalex.org/W2036505177,"The amount of 140 individual proteins of E. coli B/r was measured during balanced growth in five different media. The abundance of each protein was determined from its absolute amount in 14C-glucose-minimal medium and a measurement of its relative amount at each growth rate using a double labeling technique. Separation of the proteins was carried out by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. This catalog of proteins, combined with 50 additional ribosomal proteins already studied, comprises about 5% of the coding capacity of the genome, but accounts for two thirds of the cell's protein mass. The behavior of most of these proteins could be described by a relatively small number of patterns. 102 of the 140 proteins exhibited nearly linear variations with growth rate. The remaining 38 proteins exhibited levels which seemed to depend more on the chemical nature of the medium than on growth rate. Proteins, including the ribosomal proteins, that increase in amount with increasing growth rate account for 20% of total cell protein by weight during growth on acetate, 32% on glucose-minimal medium and 55% on glucose-rich medium. Proteins with invariant levels in the various media comprise about 4% of the cell's total protein."

https://openalex.org/W2063358576,"Genes for yeast tRNATyr and tRNAPhe have been sequenced (Goodman, Olson and Hall, 1977; Valenzuela et al., 1978) which contain additional nucleotides (intervening sequences) within the middle of the gene that are not present in the mature tRNA. We have isolated precursors to rRNATyr and tRNAPhe from a yeast temperature-sensitive mutant (at the rna1 locus) which accumulates only certain precursor tRNAs at the nonpermissive temperature. The tRNATyr and tRNAPhe precursors were analyzed by oligonucleotide mapping; they each contain the intervening sequence and fully matured 5' and 3' termini. Furthermore, these precursors were used as substrates to search for an enzymatic activity which can remove the intervening sequences and religate the ends. We have shown that wild-type yeast contains such an activity, and that this activity specifically removes the intervening sequences to produce mature-sized RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2027173346,"The effect of temperature shifts on the rates of synthesis of selected individual polypeptides in wild-type E. coli was studied through pulse-labeling and resolution of protein by the O'Farrell two-dimensional gel system. The overall rate of protein synthesis quickly accelerated to its new steady state rate after temperature shifts, but the differential rates of synthesis of most individual polypeptides studied either increased transiently (as much as 50 fold) or decreased transiently (as much as 10 fold). Their new steady state values, usually the pre-shift values, were reched 20 min after the shift. The magnitude of the responses depended upon the size of the temperature shift, and a shift downward generated responses opposite to those of a shift upward. The ten aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and five transcriptional or other translational factors studied responded with greater similarity than did a group of nine unidentified polypeptides chosen from different regulatory classes. Guanosine tetraphosphate accumulated transiently upon a temperature shift upward, but reducing this accumulation did not in general alter the quantitative responses of the polypeptides. For some proteins, these transients accomplish rapid attainment of a new steady state level. Many of the transients seem to be active regulatory responses."

Hartwell L.H. McLaughlin C.S. Temperature sensitive yeast mutant defective in ribonucleic acid production. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 99: 807-814 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We have examined ts136 to determine whether it is defective in tRNA biosynthesis. At the restrictive temperature, the mutant accumulates twelve new species of RNA. These species co-migrate on polyacrylamide gels with some of the pulse-labeled precursor tRNAs. Three of the new RNAs (species 1a, 1b and 1c are large enough to contain two tandom tRNAs. Although RNAs 1a, 1b and 1c do not contain detectable levels of modified and methylated bases, at least one of them hybridizes to DNA from an E. coli plasmid containing a yeast tRNA gene. All the remaining RNAs (2–8) contain modified and methylated bases typical of tRNA. Three of these species were tested and were found to hybridize to tRNA genes. Ribosomal RNA synthesis is also defective in ts136. It is suggested that ts136 may be defective in a nucleolytic activity, which is a prerequisite to RNA transport."
https://openalex.org/W1594501145,"Two separate enzymes, which determine resistance to inorganic mercury and organomercurials, have been purified from the plasmid-bearing Escherichia coli strain J53-1(R831). The mercuric reductase that reduces Hg2+ to volatile Hg0 was purified about 240-fold from the 160,000 X g supernatant of French press disrupted cells. This enzyme contains bound FAD, requires NADPH as an electron donor, and requires the presence of a sulfhydryl compound for activity. The reductase has a Km of 13 micron HgCl2, a pH optimum of 7.5 in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, an isoelectric point of 5.3, a Stokes radius of 50 A, and a molecular weight of about 180,000. The subunit molecular weight, determined by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, is about 63,000 +/- 2,000. These results suggest that the native enzyme is composed of three identical subunits. The organomercurial hydrolase, which breaks the mercury-carbon bond in compounds such as methylmercuric chloride, phenylmercuric acetate, and ethylmercuric chloride, was purified about 38-fold over the starting material. This enzyme has a Km of 0.56 micron for ethylmercuric chloride, a Km of 7.7 micron for methylmercuric chloride, and two Km values of 0.24 micron and over 200 micron for phenylmercuric acetate. The hydrolase has an isoelectric point of 5.5, requires the presence of EDTA and a sulfhydryl compound for activity, has a Stokes radius of 24 A, and has a molecular weight of about 43,000 +/- 4,000."

https://openalex.org/W2042470331,The distribution of three cell surface markers on dissociated cultures of the rat dorsal root ganglion has been investigated using indirect immunofluorescence. Tetanus toxin binds to a nondividing class of cells with neuronal morphology. Ran-1 is expressed by Schwann cells. Thy-1 is expressed both by fibroblasts and by all the neurones. These assignments have been confirmed by detection of any two of these markers in a single culture using antisera conjugated to different fluorochromes. Approximately 20% of the nonneuronal cells in these cultures were negative for all three markers.
https://openalex.org/W2071744012,"We have detected two independent occurrences of insertion mutations in the lacl gene of E. Coli, and have used small plasmids carrying the l gene to purify large amounts of DNA containing these insertions. Analyses with restriction endonucleases and DNA sequencing techniques establish that both insertions involve the previously characterized element IS1. In each case, the integration of IS1 into the l gene DNA is associated with a directly repeated sequence of 9 nucleotides appearing at each end of the insertion element. Since one of these sequences was present in the wild-type gene, the second sequence either preexisted in the IS1 before integration, or else was generated by the process of insertion itself. The 9 base repeat is different in both cases. We discuss the relevance of these findings to the mechanism of integration of transposable elements."
https://openalex.org/W103709917,"Chitin synthetase was solubilized with digitonin from a particulate yeast fraction. The solubilized enzyme, which did not sediment at 200,000 X g and emerged after the void volume in a Sepharose 6B column, was active only after treatment with a protease. This confirms that chitin synthetase exists in the plasma membrane as a zymogen and that initiation of the chitin septum occurs by localized activation of the enzyme. By differential extraction with sodium cholate and digitonin, followed by chromatography on Sepharose 6B, a 20-fold purification of the enzyme was achieved with respect to the crude particles. The purified enzyme showed a requirement for a phospholipid; phosphatidylserine and lysophosphatidylserine were the best activators. Unsaturated fatty acids strongly inhibited synthetase activity, whereas their saturated counterparts were inert. The solubilized enzyme catalyzed the formation of insoluble chitin in the absence of added primer. The synthetic polysaccharide was examined by electron microscopy and found to consist of lozenge-shaped particles about 60 nm long and 10 nm wide."
https://openalex.org/W2088628591,"Three independent integrations of the E. coli insertion sequence, IS1, into the gal operon have been analyzed. DNA sequences of portions of the wild-type galT gene which act as the target sites for these insertions, as well as the corresponding gal/IS1 junctions, are reported. Two features are particularly noteworthy. First, similar sequences appearing in inverted orientation consitute the ends of IS1: 18 of the terminal 23 base pairs at each end are identical. Second, in all three insertions, a 9 base pair segment found once in the wild-type sequence at the site of insertion is duplicated and appears in the same orientation at each end of the inserted element. The sequence of this 9 base pair repeat is different for each insertion analyzed. No homology between the inverted repeat sequences at the ends of IS1 and the sequences of the target sites is observed. Models for the mechanism of IS1 insertion are proposed."

There is some evidence for their role in pain, stress, and affect. We report that the opiate antagonist, naloxone, alters some schizophrenic symptoms. In a double-blind, cross-over study, naloxone produced decreases in auditory hallucinations in some schizophrenic patients. This finding supports the hypothesis that the endorphins may play a roll in modulating hallucinations in a highly selected subgroup of chronically hallucinating schizophrenic patients."

https://openalex.org/W1564194038,"Screening of a collection of temperature-sensitive mutants of Escherichia coli for defects in phospholipid metabolism led to the isolation of a mutant deficient in cardiolipin synthesis. The defective gene, named cls, is closely linked to the trp marker and maps at about Minute 27 on the E. coli chromosome. After transfer of cls to a defined genetic background by transduction, the mutant has the following properties as compared to an isogenic wild type. Exponentially growing cells show a reduction in cardiolipin content by a factor of at least 15 (less than 0.2 mol % of the total phospholipids). A crude membrane fraction derived from the mutant is unable to synthesize cardiolipin from phosphatidylglycerol in vitro. The mutant has no distinctive phenotype regarding its growth properties, membrane-associated respiratory functions, or the ability to insert bacteriophage M13 coat protein into the cell envelope. The cls mutation confers a 5-times reduction in the turnover of the phosphate moiety of phosphatidylglycerol."

https://openalex.org/W2002483963,"Cytoplasmic microtubule assembly from tubulin monomers requires an accessory protein or proteins present in isolated microtubules. These proteins have been designated “tau” factors. One such factor, tubulin assembly protein (TAP), has been purified to homogeneity from calf brain microtubules. A precipitating, monospecific antibody against the protein has been prepared. The antibody has been used to investigate the mechanism of TAP action in microtubule assembly and the distribution of TAP in cellular microtubules. Immunochemical, immunofluorescent and electron microscopic studies indicate that TAP functions stoichiometrically by binding physically to tubulin to form a complex active in microtubule assembly. TAP is an elongation protein which is required throughout the growth of a microtubule and which is actually present along the entire microtubule. Immunofluorescence microscopy has been used to demonstrate that TAP is distributed throughout the cytoplasmic microtubule network of cultured human, hamster and rat cells — both normal and virally transformed. Immunofluorescence of cells in mitosis shows that TAP is present in the mitotic spindle. These results demonstrate the biological importance of tubulin assembly protein and suggest that it or immunologically related “tau” proteins represent ubiquitous co-factors in cytoplasmic microtubule assembly."

https://openalex.org/W1526807902,"The effects of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and its subassemblies and subunits on the in vitro synthesis of beta subunit directed by DNA from a lambda transducing phage lambdadrif+-6 were investigated. This phage carries the structural gene (rpoB) for beta subunit as well as the genes for EF (translation elongation factor)-Tu, some ribosomal proteins, and stable RNAs of the E. coli chromosome. Among the RNA polymerase proteins examined, the two oligomers, holoenzyme and alpha2beta complex, repressed the synthesis of only the beta subunit but not of other proteins encoded by the phage DNA. The results indicate that the expression of at least the betabeta' (rpoBC) operon is under autogenous regulation, in which both holoenzyme and alpha2beta complex function as regulatory molecules with repressor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2027448966,"We used an assay in vitro to investigate the possible role of streptococcal adherence to human pharyngeal cells in the pathogenesis of acute rheumatic fever. There was no difference in adherence of rheumatic fever-associated and non-associated strains of group A streptococci to pooled pharyngeal cells of normal people. Likewise, streptococci not associated with rheumatic fever adhered equally well to cells taken from normal people and from patients with rheumatic heart disease. However, the pharyngeal cells of all nine rheumatic heart disease patients tested had increased avidity for adherence for a rheumatic fever-associated strain of streptococcus compared to the pharyngeal cells obtained from age- and sex-matched controls. Increased streptococcal adherence to pharyngeal cells of rheumatic fever-prone patients may play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever."
https://openalex.org/W1554659423,"Abstract CTP-phosphatidic acid cytidyltransferase catalyzes the formation of CDP-diglyceride from CTP and phosphatidic acid. The enzyme was solubilized from crude mitochondrial membrane by treatment with digitonin and was further purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, quaternary aminoethyl (QAE) Sephadex, and Sepharose 6B columns. At this stage the enzyme, enriched 550-fold over crude cell homogenate, still remains associated with phospholipid and has an estimated approximate molecular weight of 400,000 on the basis of gel filtration chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the 550-fold enriched enzyme yielded two major protein bands having molecular weights of 45,000 and 19,000. The enzyme exhibits an absolute dependence on Triton X-100, a sharp Mg2+ dependence with an optimum at 20 mM, and a pH optimum of 6.5 for activity. The product of the CTP-phosphatidic acid cytidyl-transferase reaction has been isolated and identified as CDP-diglyceride, both for the crude enzyme preparation as well as for the 550-fold enriched enzyme. CTP-phosphatidic acid cytidyltransferase is capable of catalyzing the reverse reaction in the presence of pyrophosphate, utilizing CDP-diglyceride as substrate. The product of the reverse reaction was identified as CTP. Kinetic analysis of the behavior of CTP-phosphatidic acid cytidyltransferase was performed at three different stages of its purification. Initial analysis of the data yielded biphasic behavior in double reciprocal plots with respect to both substrates. Hill plots of the data indicated the presence of negative cooperativity. A detailed analysis of the kinetic behavior was performed on the enzyme purified 550-fold. The data suggest a mechanism involving two distinct cycles of catalysis, responsive to homotropic modification, with different affinities for both substrates. Further analysis of the kinetic behavior in the presence of inhibitors (dCTP and PPi) yielded a reaction order for the entrance of substrates and departure of products from the reaction cycles. The high affinity site catalyzes the reaction via a double displacement mechanism and is the predominant form at low concentrations of substrates. At high concentrations of substrates the low affinity site starts contributing significantly to the reaction velocity with an ordered single displacement mechanism. In each case CTP is the first substrate to attach and PPi is the first product released."
https://openalex.org/W1514949239,"Phosphate-water oxygen exchange catalyzed by Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase was monitored using the 18O shift on the 31P NMR signal of inorganic phosphate. Different kinetic patterns were observed with native zinc enzyme and with its cobalt analogue. For native enzyme at pH values ranging from 4.4 to 10.0, the distribution of 18O species in Pi, viz. P18O4, P18O316O,P18O216O2,P18O16O3,P16O4, with time is compatible with a kinetic scheme in which E-P, the noncovalent enzyme-phosphate complex, dissociates more rapidly than it forms the covalent complex E-P. For the cobalt enzyme at pH 6.8, the distribution of 18O species in Pi with time is different and leads to the conclusion that formation of E-P is more rapid than dissociation of Pi from E-P-A computer simulation gave good quantitative agreement with the observed distribution for the time course of the cobalt enzyme reaction when the ratio of the rate of formation of E-P to dissection of E-P was assumed to be 3 +/- 0.5."

Solubilized enzyme was associated with one or more proteins with s20, w = 3.3 S, Stokes' radius = 40 A, and computed molecular weight = 54,500. In the presence of detergent the enzyme was catalytically inactive and unstable to heat. When detergent was removed with cholestyramine resin, both phases of squalene synthesis (farnesyl pyrophosphate leads to presqualene pyrophosphate leads to squalene) were recovered, and the enzyme was reaggregated to form sedimentable particles with a density of approximately 1.16 g/ml. Both activities were lost to variable extent upon chromatography over Sephadex G-200 in the presence of 0.2% deoxycholate, but could be recovered if phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine (but not phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylinositol) were added to fractions before removal of detergent. There was an apparently absolute requirement for phospholipid by the enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W1568303364,"The interaction of bacteriophage T7 specific RNA polymerase with its cognate promoter sites has been probed by selectively replacing bases in one T7 promoter site with base analogs. Base analogs such as 2,6-diaminopurine or hypoxanthine, which alter residues appearing in the minor groove of the DNA helix, prevent utilization of the promoter by T7 RNA polymerase. These analogs do not affect transcription which starts outside of the modified region. In contrast, base analogs that have alterations that appear in the major groove of the DNA helix, such as uracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and [5-HgSR]pyrimidines, do not prevent utilization of the promoter. The deoxyribonucleoside analog 5'-imino-5'-deoxythymidine, an alteration appearing in the deoxyribose-phosphodiester backbone of the DNA helix, does not prevent promoter recognition. Haemophilus aegyptius restriction endonuclease III, which cleaves DNA at the sequence 5'GGCC3', does not act at sites in which the guanine residues in one of the two DNA strands have been substituted with hypoxanthine. This implicates the guanine amino group in the minor groove of the DNA helix as a possible recognition point for this restriction endonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1502308179,"The reaction of lac repressor protein with fluorescein mercuric acetate has been studied. A maximum of 1.5 cysteine residues/monomer was modified with this reagent; the presence of ligands (inducer, anti-inducer, nonspecific DNA) did not affect ‘the reaction. Modification of the cysteines increased the affinity of the protein for inducer, but did not affect binding to nonspecific DNA. The operator binding activity, in contrast, was abolished at excesses of reagent 20.75 mercurials/monomer. Reversal of the effects on operator and inducer binding activity could be obtained by addition of dithiothreitol to the modified repressor protein. Mapping studies to determine the extent of reaction at each of the cysteines indicated that with excesses of fluorescein mercuric acetate below 0.5 molecules/monomer, cysteine 268 was less reactive than either cysteine 107 or cysteine 140; at the point of maximum reaction, each of the cysteines was approximately 50% reacted. Using 2-bromoacetamido-4-nitrophenol as a selective blocking agent for cysteines 107 and 140 prior to reaction with fluorescein mercuric acetate, the loss of operator binding activity was decreased, while no effect was observed on the increased affinity for inducer noted for mercurial modified protein. The loss of operator DNA binding activity with simultaneous maintenance of nonspecific DNA binding activity suggests that, while the determinants for binding may overlap, there are also independent determinants. It is of interest to note that loss of operator binding occurred with modification of residues in the core region of the molecule rather than in the NH2 terminus. Perturbations of the protein structure by inducer, anti-inducer, and nonspecific DNA were reflected in the fluorescein absorbance spectrum. Inducer difference spectra and anti-inducer difference spectra exhibited opposite characteristics; this is consistent with their different effects on the function of the protein molecule. Nonspecific DNA also perturbed the fluorescein spectrum; part of this difference spectrum involves direct interaction of the fluorescein mercuric acetate with the nucleic acid, but the spectrum also contained components attributable to perturbation of the fluorescein spectrum indirectly through the protein. This constitutes the first direct spectral evidence for the effect of nonspecific DNA on the protein structure. It is interesting to note that the spectral changes arise from residues which are in the core region of the molecule"

The 5.8 S RNA component together with 5 S rRNA can be released from subunits or whole ribosomes by brief heat treatment or in 50% formamide; the Tm for the heat dissociation of 5.8 S RNA is 47 degrees C. This Tm is only slightly lower when 5 S rRNA is released first with EDTA treatment prior to heat treatment. No ribosomal proteins are released by the brief heat treatment. A significant portion of the 5.8 S RNA reassociates with the 60 S subunit when suspended in a higher salt buffer (e.g.0.4 m KCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mM magnesium acetate, 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol). The Tm of this reassociated complex is also 47 degrees C. The results indicate that in yeast ribosomes the 5.8 S-26 S rRNA interaction is stabilized by ribosomal proteins but that the association is sufficiently loose to permit a reversible dissociation of the 5.8 S rRNA molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1585759422,We have synthesized bromoacetylpyridoxamine phosphate and bromoacetylpyridoxamine and have shown that they meet three criteria for affinity labels of the beta2 subunit of tryptophan synthase: (i) the kinetic data of inactivation indicate that a binary complex is formed prior to covalent attachment; (ii) inactivation is largely prevented by the presence of pyridoxal phosphate; and (iii) inactivation is stoichiometric with incorporation of 0.7 to 0.8 mol of chromophore/mol of beta monomer. Our conclusion that inactivation of the apo beta2 subunit by bromoacetylpyridoxamine phosphate is due to the modification of cysteine is based on the disappearance of 1 mol of -SH/beta monomer and on the finding that [14C]carboxymethyl derivative in the acid hydrolysate of the protein modified by bromo[14C]acetylpyridixamine phosphate.

https://openalex.org/W1577850652,"Purified Escherichia coli tRNAAla and tRNALys were each converted to modified species terminating in 2'- and 3'-deoxyadenosine. The modified species were tested as substrates for activation by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and for misacylation with phenylalanine by yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. E. coli alanyl- and lysyl-tRNA synthetases normally aminoacylate their cognate tRNA's exclusively on the 3'-OH group, while yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase utilizes only the 2' position on its own tRNA. Therefore, the finding that the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase activated only those modified tRNAAla and tRNALys species terminating in 3'-deoxyadenosine indicated that the position of aminoacylation in this case was specified entirely by the enzyme, an observation relevant to the more general problem of the reason(s) for using a particular site for aminoacylation and maintaining positional specificity during evolution. Initial velocity studies were carried out using E. coli tRNAAla and both alanyl- and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases. As noted in other cases, activation of the modified and unmodified tRNA's had essentially the same associated Km values, but in each case the Vmax determined for the modified tRNA was smaller."
