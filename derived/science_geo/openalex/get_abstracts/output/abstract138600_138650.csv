We have used cre-loxPtechnology in combination with gene targeting to perform global, β cell-, and hepatocyte-specific gene knock-outs of this enzyme in mice. Gene targeting was used to create a triple-loxed gk allele, which was converted by partial or total Cre-mediated recombination to a conditional allele lacking neomycin resistance, or to a null allele, respectively. β cell- and hepatocyte-specific expression of Cre was achieved using transgenes that contain either insulin or albumin promoter/enhancer sequences. By intercrossing the transgenic mice that express Cre in a cell-specific manner with mice containing a conditional gk allele, we obtained animals with either a β cell or hepatocyte-specific knock-out of GK. Animals either globally deficient in GK, or lacking GK just in β cells, die within a few days of birth from severe diabetes. Mice that are heterozygous null for GK, either globally or just in the β cell, survive but are moderately hyperglycemic. Mice that lack GK only in the liver are only mildly hyperglycemic but display pronounced defects in both glycogen synthesis and glucose turnover rates during a hyperglycemic clamp. Interestingly, hepatic GK knock-out mice also have impaired insulin secretion in response to glucose. These studies indicate that deficiencies in both β cell and hepatic GK contribute to the hyperglycemia of MODY-2.

Both β cells and hepatocytes are key sites of GK expression, and both play central roles in glucose homeostasis. In pancreatic β cells GK determines glucose utilization and thus is necessary for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In liver, GK is thought to determine rates of both glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis and is also viewed as being essential for the regulation of various glucose-responsive genes (11Girard J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Although GK is also expressed in certain hypothalamic nuclei of the brain, where it might contribute to feeding behavior and counter regulatory responses, and in the gut, where it might contribute to the secretion of enteroincretins such as GLP-1 (12Jetton T.L.

These studies have revealed a reciprocal relationship between GK gene copy number and the blood glucose concentration (19Niswender K.D. Postic C. Shiota M. Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). GK gene knock-out mice have provided useful animal models for MODY-2, but analysis of these mice has been limited by several issues. First, mice that totally lack both islet and hepatic isoforms of GK, or even just the islet isoform, do not live for more than a few days, thereby preventing detailed physiological studies in adult animals. Second, the phenotype of mice that globally lack GK remains unsettled. Two different lines of global GK null mice differ markedly in their age of death; one is lethal at mid-gestation (13Bali D. Svetlanov A. Lee H.-W. Fusco-DeMane D. Leiser M. Li B. Barzilai N. Surana M. Hou H. Fleischer N. DePinho R. Rossetti L. Efrat S. J. Biol.

Stewart T.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Third, the role of the liver in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia that characterizes MODY-2 has not been clearly resolved. Characterization of the cell-specific roles of GK in glucose homeostasis requires an animal model in which the enzyme can be selectively eliminated in selected sites without affecting expression in other sites. To achieve this, we made use of the cre-loxPgene targeting strategy since it enables mice containing cell-specific gene deletions to be created (20Tsien J.Z. Chen D.F. Gerber D. Tom C. Mercer E.H.

We describe here the generation of mice bearing two variant conditional gk alleles. We converted one of these conditional, loxed gk alleles to a null allele, and we also generated mice that express either insulin-cre (Rip-cre) or albumin-cre (Alb-cre) transgenes. By intercrossing two cell-specific Cre transgenes with the loxedgk allele, we generated mice with either hepatic or β cell-specific defects in GK expression. Analysis of these different global and tissue-specific GK gene knock-outs has allowed us to more clearly define how deficiencies in both hepatic and β cell GK cause MODY-2. The key features of the targeting vector used, shown in Fig. 1 a, are a phosphoglycerol kinase-neomycin resistance gene cassette (neoR), a phosphoglycerol kinase-herpes simplex virus type I thymidine kinase gene cassette, and three 34-bp loxP sequences (25Sauer B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Two of the loxP sites flank neoR, and the third is located between exons 8 and 9 of the GK gene. The vector was assembled in pNTK(A) (a gift from Dr. Richard Mortensen, Harvard Medical School) using loxP sites isolated from pBS246 (25Sauer B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and mouse GK gene fragments isolated from clone λ21 which was obtained from a 129/Ola P1 clone (26Postic C. Niswender K.D. Decaux J.-F. Parsa R. Shelton K.D. Gouhot B. Pettepher C.C. Granner D.K. Girard J. Magnuson M.A. Genomics. 1995; 29: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A detailed description of the 11 DNA manipulations required to assemble the targeting vector are available on request. Correct assembly of this vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The sequences altered in the gk lox allele were deposited in GenBankTM (accession numbers AF047362 and AF47830). 50 μg of the targeting vector was linearized with NotI and then electroporated into 5 × 107 TL-1 ES cells, a line derived from 129/SvEvTacBR mice (27Labosky P.A. Barlow D.P. Hogan B.L.M. Development. 1994; 120: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of several clones resistant to both G418 and ganciclovir revealed one clone, BG7, that had undergone the desired recombination event. NeoR was removed from this clone by partial Cre-mediated recombination. Briefly, 5 × 107 cells were electroporated with 50 μg of uncut pBS185, a CMV-cre expression vector (25Sauer B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were plated at low dilution without G418 or ganciclovir selection, and ∼200 clones were picked and characterized. From these, a single clone (BE8) was identified that had undergone partial recombination, thereby removing neoR and one loxP site but leaving both exons 9 and 10 and its flanking loxP sites intact. Both the BG7 and BE8 ES cell clones were microinjected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts and implanted into pseudopregnant ICR female recipients (28Robertson E.J. Robertson E.D. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 71-112Google Scholar). Male chimeras were mated with C57Bl/6 females, and germline transmission was identified by both Southern blot and PCR analysis of tail DNA (29Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 293-295Google Scholar). Except for the gk lox/lox mice, which were maintained as both inbred (129/SvEvTac) and hybrid lines, all other combinations of the conditional gk alleles and cell-specific Cre transgenes were studied as hybrid lines derived from 129/SvEvTac, C57Bl/6, and DBA-2 strains. All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free barrier facilities, maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed a standard rodent chow (Purina Mills, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Pups from both sexes were used for analyses at day 2. For the rest of the studies only males were used. Animals were killed during the post-absorptive state (between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m.) except as specified. Cre-mediated recombination of thegk lox+neo allele into agk del allele was performed by pronuclear microinjection of supercoiled pBS185 DNA (25Sauer B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) into single cell mouse embryos derived from mating gk lox+neo males with superovulated B6D2 F1 hybrid females. Conversion of thegk lox+neo allele into agk del allele was detected by both Southern blot and PCR analysis of tail DNA from all resulting pups. The removal of exons 9 and 10 eliminates 125 of the 465 amino acids in both isoforms of GK. An insulin-cre transgene (Rip-cre) was assembled by removing nls-cre coding sequences from pmL78 (kindly provided by Mark Lewandowsky, University of California, San Francisco) by digestion with SalI andEcoRI and cloning them into the corresponding sites of pBSIIKS. A 668-bp fragment of the rat insulin 2 promoter (Rip) was ligated into the XhoI andKpnI sites of this vector, and a 2.1-kilobase pair fragment of the human growth hormone (hGH) gene was inserted into theSpeI site. Finally, the plasmid was digested withSalI and religated to remove a small intervening DNA fragment that had been created. The albumin-cre transgene (Alb-cre) was made by removing the nls-cre and hGH fusion fragment from the Rip-cre-hGH vector by digestion with XbaI. This fragment was blunt-ended by Klenow fill-in and then ligated into an EcoRV site of a plasmid containing the 2335-bp rat albumin enhancer/promoter fragment (kindly provided by Richard Palmiter, University of Washington) (30Pinkert C.A. Ornitz D.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Genes Dev. 1987; 3: 268-276Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The Rip-cre-hGH and Alb-cre-hGH plasmids were digested with KpnI andNotI, and the transgenes were isolated by gel electrophoresis and agarase digestion. These DNA fragments were microinjected into the pronuclei of B6D2 F2 hybrid mice by the Vanderbilt Transgenic/ES Cell Shared Resource. Tail DNA from potential founder mice was screened by Southern blot analysis for DNA integration. Rip-cre founder 25 and Alb-crefounder 21, the two Cre transgenic mice selected for use in this study, were estimated to contain 9 and 7 transgene copies, respectively. Three different gk alleles (gk w, gk lox, andgk del) were routinely distinguished by PCR analysis. The gk w allele was detected using primers 1 (5′-TGTCTCAATTTGCTGTGTCCTCCA) and 2 (5′-TCTGTTAATGCAAATGCTCGTGTT), which amplify a 605-bp fragment. Thegk lox allele was detected as a 710-bp fragment after amplification with primers 1 and 2. Thegk del allele was detected as a 435-bp DNA fragment using primers 2 and 3 (5′-TTGAGACCCGTTTTGTGTCG). Both theAlb-cre and Rip-cre transgenes were detected using the primers 5′-ACCTGAAGATGTTCGCGATTATCT and 5′-ACCGTCAGTACGTGAGATATCTT, which amplify a 370-bp fragment. ThelacZ transgenes were detected using the primers 5′-TGCTGATGAAGCAGAACAACTT and 5′-TATTTAATCAGCGACTGTCC, which amplify a 602-bp fragment. RNA was isolated from mouse tissues according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63169) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out by first diluting 1 μg of RNA in 20 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water, denaturing at 85 °C for 3 min, and chilling on ice. In a 20-μl reaction containing 750 ng of the denatured RNA, 2 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 3 μm MgCl2 (Perkin-Elmer), 1 mm dNTPs (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 10 units of reverse transcriptase, 20 units of RNasin, and 5 μg of oligo(dT) primer, first strand cDNA synthesis was carried out by incubating the reaction at 25 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 30 min, 42 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 5 min, and 5 °C for 5 min. After cDNA synthesis, PCR was carried out in 50-μl reactions containing 5 μl of 10× PCR mix, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 40 μm dATP, dTTP, dGTP, 20 μm dCTP, 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), and 10 pmol of the primers 5′-GAAGCCTATATCCCAAAGGAA and 5′-GACCTTCAACGGTGAGGTCA, which amplify a fragment of 548 bp. Thermal cycling consisted of a 5-min denaturation at 95 °C followed by 26 cycles of 1 min denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min annealing at 59 °C, and 1 min extension at 72 °C. After a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min, 5 μl of the final reaction was mixed with 5 μl of sequencing gel loading buffer and denatured, and 4 μl was separated in a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel prior to autoradiography. A Cre-inducible nls-lacZreporter gene (CMV-RAGE-β-Gal) was provided by Dr. Alan Naftalin (Division of Cardiology, Vanderbilt University), which contains, in sequential order, a cytomegalovirus promoter, loxP, yeast His3 (stop) sequences, loxP, and nls-lacZ. The transgene was separated from vector DNA by digestion withSphI and NotI and gel electrophoresis. CATZ transgenic mice (32Agah R. Frenkel P.A. French B.A. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), which contain a β actin promoter-driven Cre-activable β-galactosidase fusion gene, were kindly provided by M. Schneider (Baylor College of Medicine). Both lacZ reporter mice were estimated to have ∼35 copies of the transgenes in their genome by quantitative Southern analysis. Tissues were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen after removal from the animal, and genomic DNA was prepared according to Hogan et al. (29Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 293-295Google Scholar). The efficiency of Cre recombination was usually assessed by Southern blot analysis. DNA was digested with either BglII or XmnI, and the blots were probed with either an ∼900-bp DNA fragment containing GK exons 9 and 10 or a ∼600-bp BamHI-EcoRI fragment located at the 3′ end of the GK gene locus (Fig.1 a). Blood glucose concentrations were determined with a Hemocue blood glucose analyzer (Hemocue, Mission Viejo, CA). Plasma glucose concentrations were determined using a micro-assay procedure (33Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grabl M. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 163-172Google Scholar). The values obtained from the Hemocue were ∼20% lower than the values determined by plasma glucose assay. Plasma insulin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) using a rat insulin RIA kit from Linco Research (St. Louis, MO). Plasma non-esterified fatty acids were measured with a NEFA C kit from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. Hepatic glycogen content was analyzed as described by Keppler et al. (34Keppler D. Decker K. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 11-18Google Scholar). Plasma triglycerides and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were measured using a colorimetric kit from Sigma. Western blot analysis and GK activities in crude liver extracts were determined as described previously (35Niswender K.D. Postic C. Jetton T.L. Bennet B.D. Piston D.W. Efrat S. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22564-22569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Organs were quickly removed after cervical dislocation and fixed in 4.0% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.6, for 2–4 h, and washed in PBS overnight. Tissues were either infiltrated in 30% sucrose/PBS for cryostat sectioning or dehydrated in ethanol for paraffin embedding. lacZ expression was detected by incubating tissues in stain solution (8.4 mm KCl; 84 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5; 2 mmMgCl2; 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6; 5 mm K4FeCN6; 0.01% sodium deoxycholate; 0.02% Nonidet P-40; 1% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactosidase) for 12 h at room temperature. Samples processed for histological examination were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For detection of glycogen, cryostat sections of liver were subjected to the periodic acid-Schiff technique. Sections were oxidized 10 min in 0.5% periodic acid, washed, and stained with Schiff's reagent for 5 min. For the detection of neutral lipid, liver cryosections were stained with the Oil Red O technique using 0.23% dye dissolved in 65% isopropyl alcohol for 10 min. Following washing, sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Tissues were processed for immunocytochemical analysis as described previously (36Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2619-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For Cre immunostaining, whole pancreas was fixed and equilibrated in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were then frozen in OCT in a cryostat chamber at −20 to −35 °C, sectioned, mounted onto electrostatically charged slides, and allowed to dry at room temperature for at least 30 min. Cre was then detected using a rabbit polyclonal antisera to Cre (kindly provided by Barbara Morris, Novagen). Hyperglycemic clamp studies were performed using chronically cannulated, conscious mice as described previously (18Niswender K.D. Shiota M. Postic C. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22570-22575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). All groups of mice were fasted 6–8 h prior to the experimentation. Body weight, hematocrit, and general appearance were used as indices of health. A variable infusion of 50% glucose was used to raise blood glucose levels to ∼300 mg/dl. A 4 μCi bolus of tracer ([3-3H]glucose, NEN Life Science Products) was given at −100 min, followed by a constant 0.04 μCi/min for the duration of the study. The glucose turnover rate (mg/kg/min) was calculated as the rate of tracer infusion (dpm/min) divided by the blood glucose specific activity (dpm/mg) corrected to the body weight of the mouse. Glycogen synthesis via the direct pathway was determined by measuring incorporation of [3H] into glycogen (dpm/g liver)/[3H] specific activity in plasma glucose (dpm/mg). All results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of the mean. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. A conditional GK gene allele (gk lox+neo) that contains three loxPsites and a neomycin resistance (neoR) cassette was created by gene targeting in ES cells (Fig.1 a). This allele contains twoloxP sites flanking exons 9 and 10 and a thirdloxP site downstream of neoR. By partial Cre-mediated recombination in ES cells, thegk lox+neo allele was converted to a second conditional allele (gk lox) that lacks neoR and contains only two loxP sites (Fig.1 a). Correct gene targeting and gene conversion in ES cells was confirmed by Southern blot (Fig. 1, b and c) and PCR analysis (not shown). ES cells containing either agk lox+neo or gk lox allele were then used to generate mice with these two conditional alleles, and each were bred to homozygosity. Both lines of mice obtained in this manner were viable, but each exhibited subtle perturbations in their blood glucose concentration. Eight-week-oldgk lox+neo/lox+neo mice had a blood glucose concentration of 242 ± 9 mg/dl compared with 194 ± 3 mg/dl for the gk lox/lox mice and 175 ± 8 mg/dl for mice with two high activity (gk a) wild type alleles (hereafter designated as gk w) (37Moates J.M. Postic C. Decaux J.-F. Girard J. Magnuson M.A. Genomics. 1997; 45: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The mice were otherwise normal after at least six generations of inbreeding. Since the mixing of different inbred strains of mice may have contributed to the minor differences observed, we also compared the basal blood glucose concentrations of mice with two wild type alleles (gk w/w) with thegk lox/lox mice in an inbred 129SvEvTac background (Table I). A persistent difference was also observed, suggesting that the insertion of aloxP site and some flanking sequences between exons 8 and 9 caused a slight attenuation in GK gene expression. Indeed, measurements of hepatic GK activity indicated it was reduced by 28% ingk lox/lox mice compared withgk w/w mice (15 ± 1 milliunits/mg proteinversus 21 ± 3 milliunits/mg protein, p< 0.05).Table IComparison of post-absorptive (basal) plasma glucose concentrations (mg/dl) in different lines of mice2 days6–10 weeksHybrid micegk w/w73 ± 10175 ± 8n = 8n = 14gk del/w117 ± 10ap < 0.05, compared togkw/w mice.304 ± 21bp < 0.001 compared togk w/w mice.n = 24n = 6gk del/del566 ± 64bp < 0.001 compared togk w/w mice.dAll gk del/del mice and mostgk lox/lox Rip-cre mice die within the 1st week of birth of severe diabetes.n = 9gk lox/w75 ± 7171 ± 7n = 7n = 5gk lox/lox118 ± 8ap < 0.05, compared togkw/w mice.194 ± 3ap < 0.05, compared togkw/w mice.n = 23n = 28gk lox/w + Rip-cre115 ± 4ap < 0.05, compared togkw/w mice.,cp < 0.05 compared togk lox/w mice.229 ± 16ap < 0.05, compared togkw/w mice.,cp < 0.05 compared togk lox/w mice.n = 6n = 7gk lox/lox +Rip-cre335 ± 35bp < 0.001 compared togk w/w mice.,ep < 0.05 compared togk lox/lox mice.dAll gk del/del mice and mostgk lox/lox Rip-cre mice die within the 1st week of birth of severe diabetes.n = 12gk lox/w +Alb-creND193 ± 5ap < 0.05, compared togkw/w mice.,cp < 0.05 compared togk lox/w mice.n = 7gk lox/lox +Alb-cre113 ± 14ap < 0.05, compared togkw/w mice.215 ± 6ep < 0.05 compared togk lox/lox mice.n = 5n = 9129/SvEvTac inbred micegk w/wND132 ± 2n = 6gk lox/loxND165 ± 4ap < 0.05, compared togkw/w mice.n = 6Blood samples were collected, quickly centrifuged, and plasma removed and frozen immediately at −80 °C.

The rate-limiting step in the production of 20:4(n-6) and 22:6(n-3) is the desaturation of 18:2(n-6) and 18:3(n-3) by Δ-6 desaturase. In this report, we describe the cloning, characterization, and expression of a mammalian Δ-6 desaturase. The open reading frames for mouse and human Δ-6 desaturase each encode a 444-amino acid peptide, and the two peptides share an 87% amino acid homology. The amino acid sequence predicts that the peptide contains two membrane-spanning domains as well as a cytochrome b 5-like domain that is characteristic of nonmammalian Δ-6 desaturases. Expression of the open reading frame in rat hepatocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells instilled in these cells the ability to convert 18:2(n-6) and 18:3(n-3) to their respective products, 18:3(n-6) and 18:4(n-3). When mice were fed a diet containing 10% fat, hepatic enzymatic activity and mRNA abundance for hepatic Δ-6 desaturase in mice fed corn oil were 70 and 50% lower than in mice fed triolein. Finally, Northern analysis revealed that the brain contained an amount of Δ-6 desaturase mRNA that was several times greater than that found in other tissues including the liver, lung, heart, and skeletal muscle. The RNA abundance data indicate that prior conclusions regarding the low level of Δ-6 desaturase expression in nonhepatic tissues may need to be reevaluated.

Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids such as 20:4(n-6) and 22:6(n-3) play pivotal roles in a number of biological functions including brain development, cognition, inflammatory responses, and hemostasis (1Birch E.E.

Over 30% of the fatty acid in brain phospholipid consists of 20:4(n-6) and 22:6(n-3), and approximately 50% of the fatty acid in the retina is 22:6(n-3) (5Martinez M. J.

Nutr. 1997; 66: 1032S-1041SCrossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). An inadequate availability of 20:4(n-6) is associated with impaired nerve transmission, reduced eicosanoid synthesis, and impaired fetal growth (7Horrobin D.F.

Recently, premature infants were found to have reduced cognitive development, apparently because they could not synthesize adequate quantities of 22:6(n-3) to meet the biological demands for proper retina function (1Birch E.E. Hoffman D.R. Uauy R. Birch D.G. Prestidge C. Pediatr. Res. 1998; 44: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 10Werkman S.H. Carlson S.E. Lipids. 1996; 31: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition to being vital components of membrane phospholipids and functioning in key steps of cell signaling, 20- and 22-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids govern the expression of a wide array of genes, including those encoding proteins involved with lipid metabolism, thermogenesis, and cell differentiation (11Clarke S.D. Jump D.B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 12Clarke S.D. Baillie R. Jump D. Nakamura M.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The availability of 20- and 22-carbon (n-6) and (n-3) polyenoic fatty acids is greatly dependent upon the rate of desaturation of 18:2(n-6) and 18:3(n-3) by Δ-6 desaturase (15Sprecher H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 20: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Δ-6 Desaturase is a microsomal enzyme (15Sprecher H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 20: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and is thought to be a component of a three-enzyme system that includes NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase, cytochromeb 5, and Δ-6 desaturase (16Brenner R.R. Vergroesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity for Δ-6 desaturase is reportedly low in most tissues except the liver (16Brenner R.R. Vergroesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar). Consequently, the liver has been considered the primary site for the production of long chain polyenoic fatty acids (17Scott B.L. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2903-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 18Bourre J.M. Piciotti M. Dumont O. Lipids. 1990; 25: 354-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Numerous dietary studies indicate that hepatic Δ-6 desaturase activity is induced by diets low in essential fatty acids and suppressed by diets rich in vegetable or marine oils (19Melin T. Nilsson A. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1997; 56: 437-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Peluffo R.O. Nervi A.M. Brenner R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, Δ-6 desaturase activity is induced by peroxisome proliferators and by the administration of insulin to diabetic rats (21Kawashima Y. Musoh K. Kozuka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9170-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Igal R.A. Mandon E.C. de Gomez Dumm I.N. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 77: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, defining the molecular determinants of Δ-6 desaturase activity, as well as characterizing its developmental pattern and tissue distribution, has been hampered by the fact that Δ-6 desaturase has been neither cloned nor reproducibly purified. Therefore, our objective was to clone the mammalian Δ-6 desaturase and utilize the cDNA to examine the tissue distribution and nutritional regulation of Δ-6 desaturase mRNA. A murine cDNA (GenBank accession number W53753) displaying high homology to the amino acid sequence of Δ-6 desaturase fromSynechocystis sp. was acquired and sequenced. Subsequently, a 23-base oligonucleotide primer (5′-CTTGGCATCGTGGGGAAGAGGTG-3′) specific for the 5′ end of murine cDNA W53753 was synthesized and utilized to screen a mouse adaptor-ligated liver cDNA library (Marathon-Ready cDNA; CLONTECH) by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR.1 The PCR conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step of 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 5 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s and 72 °C for 4 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s and 70 °C for 4 min, and, finally, 20 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s and 68 °C for 4 min. The resulting rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR product was cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the PCR product was utilized to BLAST search the mouse EST database. Two mouse cDNAs (GenBank accession numbersAA237892 and AA250162) possessing 100% nucleotide homology with our PCR product were identified and acquired from Genome Systems. CloneAA250162 contained two possible AUG start codons, and the EST cDNAAA237892 contained an apparent stop codon. The two EST cDNAs were fused at the StyI restriction site, and the product was inserted into the cytomegalovirus promoter expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Sequence analysis and prediction of amino acid sequence were performed using MacDNASIS pro (Hitachi), and a translation initiator codon was determined based on Kozak's rule (24Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5233-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Using the nucleotide sequence of mouse liver Δ-6 desaturase, the EST human database was searched for a human homologue cDNA. The search identified a highly homologous human brain EST cDNA (GenBank accession number Z44979), which was purchased from Genome Systems and sequenced for verification. The 5′ end of the human cDNA was extended by PCR using a human brain cDNA library (Marathon-Ready cDNA; CLONTECH). The forward oligonucleotide primer (5′-AGACTGGCAGCATGGGGAAG-3′) was prepared using the 5′ end of the mouse Δ-6 desaturase and designed to include the putative start codon. The reverse primer (5′-CATGGTGGGGAAGAGGTGGTG-3′) was prepared from the sequence derived from human Z44979 cDNA. Cellular expression of the mouse Δ-6 desaturase was performed in rat primary hepatocytes and CHO cells. Rat primary hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion and allowed to attach to a collagen-coated 60-mm culture plate in 3 ml of Waymouth 752 medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 1 μm insulin and dexamethasone (25Armstrong M.K. Blake W.L. Clarke S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After a 6-h attachment period, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and transfected with 6 μg of the mouse Δ-6 desaturase expression plasmid or the pcDNA3.1 expression vector alone using 6.6 μl of Lipofectin per μg of DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfection was conducted by adding the mixture of Lipofectin and DNA in the absence of fetal bovine serum. After the 12-h transfection period, the medium was replaced with the one containing either 200 μm albumin-bound 18:2, n-6 (molar ratio of fatty acid to albumin, 4:1) or albumin alone. CHO cells were grown in Kaighn's modification of Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 25-cm2 flask. At 80% confluence, the serum-containing medium was removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline for transfection. A mixture of 2 μg of the mouse Δ-6 desaturase expression plasmid, 12 μl of LipofectAMINE, and 8 μl of Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to cells without serum for 4 h. Subsequently, 10% serum was added to the transfection media for 8 h. After a total 12-h transfection period, the CHO cells were treated with either 200 μm albumin-bound 18:3(n-3), 20:3(n-6), or albumin alone. The hepatocytes and CHO cells were incubated with the treatment medium for 24 h and then used for fatty acid analysis. Cellular fatty acid was extracted by saponifying fatty acids using 1 ml of 30% KOH and 1 ml of ethanol. Fatty acids from the treatment medium were also extracted and analyzed after 24 h of incubation. Heptadecanoic acid was added to the saponification mixture as an internal standard. After saponification, the nonsaponifiable lipids were removed by extraction with petroleum ether. Subsequently, the solution was acidified, and the fatty acids were extracted with petroleum ether. The extract was dried under nitrogen, and the residue was methylated using 14% boron trifluoride in methanol (Sigma). Methylated fatty acids were separated and quantified by gas chromatography using a fused silica glass capillary column (50 m × 530 μm internal diameter; Quadrex). The column temperature program was composed of an initial hold at 140 °C for 5 min, ramping at 5 °C per min to 220 °C, and a final hold at 220 °C for 7 min. The injector temperature was 250 °C, and the flame ionization detector temperature was 260 °C. Male BALB/c mice were fed a high-glucose, fat-free diet for a 7-day adaptation period. After this period, the fat-free diet was supplemented with either 10% corn oil or 10% triolein (Sigma; 99% purity), and the mice (n = 4 mice/group) were fed for an additional 5 days. Liver tissues were removed, and microsomes were isolated by differential centrifugation. One g of liver was homogenized in 4 ml of homogenization buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.25 m sucrose. After a 10-min centrifugation of the homogenate at 10,000 × g, the resulting supernatant was spun at 100,000 × g for 60 min to isolate a microsomal pellet. After resuspending the pellet in homogenization buffer, 3 mg of microsomal protein were incubated in a 37 °C shaking water bath for 5 min with 1 ml of reaction mixture including 1.2 mm NADH, 3.6 mm ATP, 0.5 mm coenzyme A, 4.8 mm MgCl2, 72 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 50 nmol of 1-14C-labeled 18:2(n-6). The reaction was stopped by adding saponification reagent, and fatty acids were saponified and methylated as described above. Radioactive 18:2(n-6) and 18:3(n-6) were separated by silver nitrate-impregnated thin layer chromatography. The radioactivity was quantified using an Ambis radio-imager. Δ-6 Desaturase enzyme activity is expressed as the percentage of 18:2(n-6) converted to 18:3(n-6) per mg of protein/min. Total RNA was isolated from the liver of mice in the dietary study using the phenol-guanidinium isothiocyanate method (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of total RNA were size-fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde gel and then transferred to a Zeta probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). The mouse Δ-6 desaturase probe was prepared by incorporating [32P]dCTP by PCR. The forward primer was 5′-GGACATAAAGAGCCTGCATG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-ACTGGAAGTACATAGGGATG-3′. The Northern membrane of human tissues was purchased from Invitrogen. The radiolabeled probe for the human tissue blot was a 200-base pair PCR fragment of human Δ-6 desaturase using primers of 5′-GGCAAGAACTCAAAGATCAC-3′ and 5′-GAGAGGTAGCAAGAACAAAG-3′. The autoradiographic signal was quantified using Instant Imager (Packard). The mouse EST database was searched for mammalian homologues using the amino acid sequence for Δ-6 desaturase from the photosynthetic cyanobacteriumSynechocystis sp. (27Reddy A.S. Nuccio M.L. Gross L.M. Thomas T.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 27: 293-300Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A mouse cDNA that had a 60% similarity to a 46-amino acid sequence of SynechocystisΔ-6 desaturase was identified. A 1508-base pair cDNA sequence for mouse liver Δ-6 desaturase was acquired using a combination of ligation-mediated PCR screening of a mouse liver cDNA library and BLAST searches of the mouse EST database (Fig.1 A). Sequence analysis revealed the presence of two in-frame methionine codons located at positions 75 and 126. In addition, a TGA termination sequence was identified at position 1407. Kozak's rule, which predicts that the favored eukaryotic translation initiation sequence resides in the sequence of AXXATGG (24Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5233-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), indicated that the first of the two ATG codons was the preferred initiation codon for the putative Δ-6 desaturase. The apparent ORF between the first ATG codon and the TGA termination codon predicted a peptide consisting of 444 amino acids and having a size of 52.2 kDa. The human brain cDNA homologue for Δ-6 desaturase contains an initiation codon and a termination codon that are perfectly aligned with the initiation and termination codons of the mouse cDNA (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, the amino acid sequence derived from the ORF revealed that 87% of the amino acid sequence for the mouse and human homologues was identical, and 96% of the sequence had similarity (Fig. 1 B). A search of the Swiss Protein Database indicated that the putative Δ-6 desaturase sequence was unique and shared very little amino acid homology with any other mammalian proteins including the murine stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Δ-9 desaturase) (28Ntambi J.M. Buhrow S.A. Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Sibley E. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17291-17300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of mammalian Δ-6 desaturase is associated with the microsomal membrane fraction (15Sprecher H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 20: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Consistent with such membrane involvement, the predicted amino acid sequence for Δ-6 desaturase indicated that the peptide contains 52% nonpolar amino acids, and a hydropathy profile revealed the presence of two membrane-spanning domains that are characteristic of membrane-anchored proteins (Figs.1 B and 2). In addition, the amino terminus of the Δ-6 desaturase peptide contains a hydrophilic domain of 54 amino acids that is highly homologous with the heme-binding domain of cytochrome b 5 (Fig.3 A). This cytochromeb 5-like domain is also found in the Δ-6 desaturases from Borago officinalis (29Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc.

J. 1998; 330: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). The His53 and His76 residues located within this domain of the mammalian Δ-6 desaturase are exactly aligned with the two heme-binding histidines in cytochrome b 5(31Lederer F. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 674-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, these two histidines are surrounded by charged amino acids that may contribute to the stabilization of the heme-histidine complex (31Lederer F. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 674-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, the sequence53HPGG56 predicts the existence of a dramatic β-turn that may render His53 more accessible to heme iron binding (31Lederer F.

Regions I (HX 3H) and II (HX 2HH) are located between the two transmembrane domains, and region III (HH) is located near the carboxyl terminus of the peptide. These histidine-rich regions are also found in plant membrane desaturases and mammalian stearoyl-CoA desaturase and reportedly bind non-heme iron that is required for enzymatic activity (32Shanklin J.

The predicted structural characteristics of the mouse and human peptides strongly suggested that the cDNAs did in fact correspond to mammalian Δ-6 desaturase. To confirm this conclusion, the ORF for the mouse Δ-6 desaturase was expressed in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and in CHO cells. Fatty acid analysis revealed that hepatocytes transfected with the vector containing the Δ-6 desaturase ORF were capable of synthesizing the Δ-6 desaturase product 18:3(n-6) from 18:2(n-6) (Fig.4 A). On the other hand, hepatocytes transfected with vector alone produced no detectable 18:3(n-6) product (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, CHO cells expressing Δ-6 desaturase readily converted the Δ-6 desaturase substrate 18:3(n-3) to the Δ-6 desaturase product 18:4(n-3), whereas nontransfected CHO cells were unable to produce detectable levels of 18:4(n-3) (Fig. 4, Cand D). In contrast, providing CHO cells with the Δ-5 desaturase substrate 20:3(n-6) did not lead to the production of the Δ-5 desaturase product 20:4(n-6) (data not shown). These data conclusively demonstrate that the mouse and human ORFs do in fact encode mammalian Δ-6 desaturase. The enzymatic activity of Δ-6 desaturase increases when animals are fed an essential fatty acid-deficient diet, whereas it decreases when polyunsaturated fatty acids are ingested (16Brenner R.R. Vergroesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar, 19Melin T. Nilsson A. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1997; 56: 437-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Peluffo R.O. Nervi A.M. Brenner R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using the mouse cDNA for Δ-6 desaturase, we have found that the suppression of hepatic Δ-6 desaturase enzymatic activity associated with the ingestion of polyunsaturated fat (i.e. corn oil) is paralleled by a comparable reduction in Δ-6 desaturase mRNA abundance (Fig. 5, A andB). Interestingly, whereas the dominant transcript of hepatic Δ-6 desaturase is approximately 4.0 kb in size, the mouse liver also contains a minor transcript that is approximately 2.2 kb (Fig. 5 B). Both transcripts appeared to be suppressed by dietary corn oil to the same degree. In addition, hybridizing the Northern blot with sequences from the 5′, middle, and 3′ regions of the Δ-6 desaturase ORF yielded the same outcomes with respect to the abundance and dietary response of the 2.2-kb transcript (data not shown). The reason for these two different transcripts remains unknown. Northern analysis of Δ-6 desaturase expression revealed that human Δ-6 desaturase mRNA is a single transcript of approximately 3.2 kb and is expressed in a wide array of tissues including the brain, liver, lung, and heart (Fig. 5 C). The level of Δ-6 desaturase mRNA in the liver was approximately the same as that found in the lung and heart, but the abundance of Δ-6 desaturase in the human brain was severalfold higher (Fig.5 C). In addition to the tissues examined by Northern analysis, a search of the EST database revealed that Δ-6 desaturase mRNA is expressed in the human fetus and fetal heart as well as in the 13-day-old mouse embryo heart. The purification and characterization of mammalian Δ-6 desaturase have been difficult because of its instability. In fact, there has been only one report, in 1981, that describes the purification of a putative linoleoyl-CoA desaturase from rat liver (33Okayasu T. Nagao M. Ishibashi T. Imai Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 206: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because of the problems encountered in the purification of Δ-6 desaturase, we have used the EST database to clone and characterize the mouse and human Δ-6 desaturase enzyme. Interestingly, a comparison of the rat liver linoleoyl-CoA desaturase with the Δ-6 desaturase peptide predicted by the ORF of both the mouse and human cDNAs indicates that the two proteins are markedly different. First, the ORF for mouse and human Δ-6 desaturase predicts a protein that is 52.2 kDa, whereas the size of the linoleoyl-CoA desaturase was cited to be 66 kDa (33Okayasu T. Nagao M. Ishibashi T. Imai Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 206: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Second, the nucleotide sequence of the mouse and human Δ-6 desaturase ORFs predicts that these peptides contain 30 histidines (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, many of these histidines are organized into distinct histidine-rich domains. Such domains are characteristic of all membrane-associated desaturases (32Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In contrast, the reported amino acid composition of linoleoyl-CoA desaturase indicates that it contains only 15 histidine residues (33Okayasu T. Nagao M. Ishibashi T. Imai Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 206: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, sequence information for linoleoyl-CoA desaturase is not available, because the purification of linoleoyl-CoA desaturase has never been replicated since the initial report. Clearly, the Δ-6 desaturase and the putative linoleoyl-CoA desaturase are distinctly different proteins. It is possible the liver contains two Δ-6 desaturase enzymes. In fact, metabolic studies suggest that there may be two isoforms of Δ-6 desaturase (34Voss A. Reinhart M. Sankarappa S. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19995-20000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Marzo I. Alava M.A. Pineiro A. Naval J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar): (a) one that catalyzes the initial desaturation of 18:2(n-6) or 18:3(n-3), and (b) another that catalyzes the conversion of 24:5(n-3) to 24:6(n-3). The cloning of the Δ-6 desaturase should now permit us to determine whether isoforms of Δ-6 desaturase do exist. In addition to the histidine-rich domains, the mammalian Δ-6 desaturase contains a distinct cytochromeb 5-like domain that is also characteristic of plant (Borage) and C. elegans Δ-6 desaturases (29Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4211-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 30Napier J.A. Hey S.J. Lacey D.J. Shewry P.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) but is not a component of the mammalian Δ-9 desaturase (36Strittmatter P. Spatz L. Corcoran D. Rogers M.J. Setlow B. Redline R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 71: 4565-4569Google Scholar). Early reconstitution studies with Δ-9 desaturase indicated that the conversion of 18:0(n-9) to 18:1(n-9) required Δ-9 desaturase, cytochrome b 5 reductase, and cytochrome b 5 itself (36Strittmatter P. Spatz L. Corcoran D. Rogers M.J. Setlow B. Redline R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 71: 4565-4569Google Scholar). It has been assumed from these early studies that all mammalian desaturases require cytochrome b 5 for enzymatic activity (16Brenner R.R. Vergroesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar, 36Strittmatter P. Spatz L. Corcoran D. Rogers M.J. Setlow B. Redline R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 71: 4565-4569Google Scholar). However, the cytochrome b 5-like domain of yeast OLE1 was recently reported to replace the requirement for cytochromeb 5; i.e. desaturation occurred in the absence of cytochrome b 5, and removal of the cytochrome b 5-like domain rendered the OLE1 enzyme inactive (37Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This observation raises the possibility that cytochrome b 5 reductase transfers electrons to the catalytic domain of the Δ-6 desaturase via the cytochromeb 5-like domain, and not via cytochromeb 5 per se. Hepatic Δ-6 desaturase enzymatic activity varies with hormonal and nutritional manipulation (15Sprecher H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 20: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 16Brenner R.R. Vergroesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar, 20Peluffo R.O. Nervi A.M. Brenner R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Nakamura M.T. Phinney S.D. Tang A.B. Oberbauer A.M. German J.B. Murray J.D. Lipids. 1996; 31: 139-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, insulin deficiency and fasting reduce Δ-6 desaturase enzymatic activity, whereas the administration of insulin or refeeding increases its activity (39Poisson J.-P. Cunnane S.C. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1991; 2: 60-70Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to being affected by fasting and feeding, hepatic Δ-6 desaturase enzymatic activity is highly dependent upon the composition of dietary fat (16Brenner R.R. Vergroesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar). Specifically, the ingestion of fats that are low in essential fatty acids (e.g. butter) results in higher levels of enzyme activity than the consumption of fats (e.g. corn oil) that are rich in essential fatty acids (16Brenner R.R. Vergroesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar). Northern analysis indicates that the increase in hepatic Δ-6 desaturase activity associated with the consumption of an essential fatty acid-deficient diet is paralleled by a comparable increase in the hepatic abundance of Δ-6 desaturase mRNA (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the activity of hepatic Δ-6 desaturase is largely regulated by pretranslational events. However, this may not be the case in all tissues. Specifically, Δ-6 desaturase activity is reportedly very low in nonhepatic tissues (16Brenner R.R. Vergroesen A.J. Crawford M. The Role of Fats in Human Nutrition. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 45-79Google Scholar, 17Scott B.L. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2903-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 18Bourre J.M. Piciotti M. Dumont O. Lipids. 1990; 25: 354-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because of this low enzymatic activity in nonhepatic tissues, the liver has been considered to be the primary site of 20:4(n-6), 20:5(n-3), and 22:6(n-3) production for peripheral tissue utilization (17Scott B.L. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2903-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). However, Northern analysis of RNA from a number of different human tissues challenges this concept (Fig. 5 C). For example, the level of Δ-6 desaturase mRNA in the human liver was comparable to that found in the human lung and heart. Moreover, the abundance of Δ-6 desaturase mRNA in the adult human brain was severalfold greater than that in the human liver (Fig. 5 C). This high level of expression is certainly very consistent with the fact that >30% of the human brain phospholipid consists of 20- and 22-carbon polyenoic fatty acids (5Martinez M. J. Pediatr. 1992; 120: S129-S138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 6Crawford M.A. Costeloe K. Ghebremeskel K. Phylactos A. Skirvin L. Stacey F. Am. J. Clin.

However, such high expression is in conflict with the reports that brain microsomes have a rate of Δ-6 desaturation that is only 10–15% of that found in the liver (18Bourre J.M. Piciotti M. Dumont O. Lipids. 1990; 25: 354-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 41Clandinin M.T. Wong K. Hacker R.R. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Δ-6 desaturase enzymatic activity may be determined by tissue-specific mechanisms that involve both pre- and post-translational events. In conclusion, Δ-6 desaturase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the conversion of 18:2(n-6) and 18:3(n-3) to the long chain polyenoic fatty acids 20:4(n-6) and 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3), respectively (15Sprecher H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 20: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). These long chain polyenoic fatty acids are essential for a large number of biological functions including inflammatory responses (4Samuelsson B. Biosci. Rep. 1983; 3: 791-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), brain development (2Uauy R. Birch E. Birch D. Peirano P. J.

Not surprisingly, physiological conditions that are associated with low levels of Δ-6 desaturase activity may have a pronounced impact on a wide array of biological functions. For example, an impaired conversion of 18:2(n-6) to 18:3(n-6) appears to be associated with reduced nerve conductivity in human diabetics (7Horrobin D.F. Diabetes. 1997; 46: S90-S93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the low rate of 18:3(n-3) conversion to 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) observed in newborn infants is highly correlated with impaired retina function and reduced cognitive development (1Birch E.E. Hoffman D.R. Uauy R. Birch D.G. Prestidge C. Pediatr. Res. 1998; 44: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Now that the Δ-6 desaturase has been cloned, we can begin to define the role that Δ-6 desaturation may play in an apparently wide array of physiological processes."

We investigated the mechanism of inhibition of COX-2 induction. Transcription (measured by a nuclear run-on assay) was 60% inhibited by SB 203580 (2 μm). Importantly, we found that p38 MAPK was essential for stabilizing COX-2 mRNA: when cells stimulated for 4 h with LPS were treated with actinomycin D, COX-2 mRNA decayed slowly. Treatment of stimulated cells with 2 μm SB 203580 caused a rapid disappearance of COX-2 mRNA, even with actinomycin D present.

The pyridinyl imidazoles inhibited TNF (and IL-1) protein production with relatively little effect on the levels of mRNA induced, and it was suggested that they worked mainly by inhibiting translation (25Young P. McDonnell P. Dunnington D. Hand A. Laydon J. Lee J. Agents Actions. 1993; 39: C67-C69Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 26Prichett W. Hand A. Sheilds J. Dunnington D. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory used SB 203580 to investigate the role of p38 MAPK in cellular responses to IL-1 (27Ridley S.H. Sarsfield S.J. Lee J.C. Bigg H.F. Cawston T.E. Taylor D.J. DeWitt D.L. Saklatvala J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3165-3173PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the drug strongly inhibited the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase 1), and stromelysin (matrix metalloproteinase 3) by IL-1 at the protein and mRNA levels within the range of its IC50 for p38 MAPK (0.1–0.5 μm) (27Ridley S.H. Sarsfield S.J. Lee J.C. Bigg H.F. Cawston T.E. Taylor D.J. DeWitt D.L. Saklatvala J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3165-3173PubMed Google Scholar). There was comparatively little inhibition of secondary cytokine production; IL-6 was only inhibited 30–50% (at 1 μm), and IL-8 was unaffected. The inhibition of induction by IL-1 of COX-2 and matrix metalloproteinase in fibroblasts at the mRNA level was in contrast to the inhibition of TNF and IL-1 protein at the translational level in LPS-activated monocytes. However, a recent report showed that LPS induction of COX-2 mRNA was inhibited by SB 203580 in monocytes (28Pouliot M. Baillargeon J. Lee J.C. Cleland L.G. James M.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4930-4937PubMed Google Scholar). It was possible that p38 MAPK regulated the expression of different genes at different levels, depending upon the cell type and the nature of the stimulus. We have therefore investigated the effects of SB 203580 on the induction of both COX-2 and TNF in monocytes stimulated by LPS and found each to be similarly inhibited at both the protein and mRNA levels. We then went on to show that in the case of COX-2, the p38 MAPK inhibitor impaired transcription and destabilized the mRNA. Doubts have recently been raised concerning the specificity of SB 203580 (29Clerk A. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 30Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.H.

We have therefore checked the sensitivity of the LPS-activated JNKs in human monocytes to the inhibitor. Lymphoprep was from Nycomed Pharma A.S. (Oslo, Norway).

A plasmid containing the mouse β-actin cDNA (1.5 kb) and pBluescript plasmid were from Stratagene, Ltd. (Cambridge, United Kingdom). For each experiment, human peripheral blood monocytes were freshly prepared from the buffy coat fraction of a unit of blood from a single donor. Mononuclear cells were prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation on a Lymphoprep gradient, and monocytes were isolated by centrifugal elutriation on a Beckman JE6 elutriator (High Wycombe, United Kingdom) using RPMI 1640 medium with l-glutamine and 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Monocyte purity was routinely assessed by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting forward/side scatter measurements in a Becton Dickinson FACScan, and cells of >80% purity with ≤10% T cells were collected. Monocytes collected in this way were typically found to be 75% pure as judged by flow cytometry using fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD-14 monoclonal antibodies. Monocytes were cultured in the same medium used for elutriation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells (5 × 106) were stimulated for the time period indicated with 10 ng ml−1 LPS and lysed for 10 min on ice in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg ml−1aprotinin, 10 μm E64, and 2 μg ml−1pepstatin A). Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 16,000 × g. p38 MAPK was immunoprecipitated by the addition of 5 μl of rabbit antiserum to the C terminus of p38 MAPK. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with mixing before the addition of 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A beads in lysis buffer, and samples were incubated for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed four times in 1 ml of wash buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium tetrapyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) and twice in 1 ml of kinase assay buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.05% BRIJ 35). p38 MAPK was assayed using 1 μg of recombinant MAPKAPK-2 as substrate in kinase assay buffer with 20 μmATP and 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in an assay volume of 30 μl. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min with agitation, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 4× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and phosphorylation of the substrate was measured on a phosphorimager (Fuji FLA-2000; Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). MAPKAPK-2 immunoprecipitation was performed in an identical fashion, but with 5 μg of sheep anti-rabbit MAPKAPK-2 antibody and protein G beads. Samples were assayed for kinase activity as described above using 1 μg of recombinant human hsp27 as substrate. 108 monocytes were lysed in 1.0 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 20 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.02% sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg ml−1 aprotinin, and 10 μm E64 for 10 min on ice. The extract was clarified and filtered (0.2 μm), and 100 μl (approximately 500 μg of protein) were applied to a 100 μl Mono Q column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 0.05% BRIJ 35. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of Buffer A, and protein was eluted with a 3-ml gradient of Buffer A containing 0–0.5 m NaCl. 100-μl fractions were collected, and 10 μl of each were assayed for JNK activity by mixing with 10 μl of glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun (1–135) (300 μg ml−1) and 10 μl of assay buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, 60 μm ATP, and 0.4 μCi μl−1 [γ-32P]ATP) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 10 μl of 4× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and the samples were electrophoresed. Phosphorylation of substrate was assessed as for p38 MAPK and MAPKAPK-2. Monocytes (3 × 107cells/assay point) were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and disrupted in a loosely fitting Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was layered onto a 30% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 3,000 revolutions/min for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 40% glycerol and stored in liquid nitrogen. Thawed nuclei were added to 200 μl of reaction mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 40 units of RNasin, 1 mm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, and 125 μCi of [α-32P] UTP (800 Ci mmol−1)) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 7.2 mg ml−1 DNase I and an additional 10-min incubation at 30 °C. 420 μl of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 100 μg ml−1 yeast tRNA, and 400 μg ml−1 proteinase K were added, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 45 min. Nuclear RNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitated from 840 μl of the aqueous phase with 600 μl of isopropanol and 200 μl of 7.5m ammonium acetate. RNA was then resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA, made 0.2m with respect to NaOH, and incubated on ice for 10 min. The solution was neutralized with HEPES and precipitated with ethanol. RNA was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA and hybridized to slot blots (plasmids linearized with EcoRI and UV-cross-linked to Hybond N membrane) in 50% formamide, 5× saline sodium phosphate EDTA, 2.5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2 mg ml−1 salmon sperm DNA. Blots were washed twice for 10 min in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 37 °C, washed for 30 min in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, and then washed twice for 10 min in 2× SSC at 37 °C. Blots were then washed for 30 min in 2× SSC and 10 μg ml−1 RNase A at 37 °C, followed by two washes in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 37 °C. Signals were quantified in a phosphorimager. Monocyte total RNA (4 μg) was electrophoresed on denaturing formaldehyde/1% agarose gels with 0.41m formaldehyde (32Brown T. Mackey K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Wiley, New York1997: 4.9.1-4.9.16Google Scholar). RNA was capillary transferred to a Hybond N membrane according to Sambrook et al. (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and fixed by UV cross-linking. cDNA probes (50 ng) for COX-2, TNF-α, and GAPDH were labeled with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Prehybridization (2 h) and hybridization (overnight) were performed at 42 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl containing 50% (v/v) formamide, 4× saline sodium phosphate EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg ml−1 heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA. Blots were washed three times for 30 min at 42 °C with 5× SSC and 0.1% SDS, 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Signals were quantified in a phosphorimager. Cell lysates (total protein, 50 μg) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were treated according to the instructions of the Enhanced Chemifluorescence kit. TNF-α enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed as described by Foeyet al. (34Foey A.D. Parry S.L. Williams L.M. Feldmann M. Foxwell B.M.J. Brennan F.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 920-928PubMed Google Scholar). Monocytes were untreated or pretreated for 1 h with increasing concentrations of SB 203580. They were then stimulated for 4 h with LPS (with the inhibitor remaining present on the pretreated cells). Cells were then immunoblotted for COX-2 protein (Fig.1 A), or RNA was extracted and Northern blotted for COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 1 B). SB 203580 inhibited both protein and mRNA in a similar dose-dependent fashion. Significant inhibition was seen at 0.1 μm (33% for protein and 50% for mRNA); this was stronger at 1 μm (55% and 72%, respectively), with some additional increase at 10 μm. The results are representative of three separate experiments with different batches of cells. Monocytes were treated for 1 h with SB 203580 or left untreated and further treated for 16 h with LPS or left untreated. Secreted TNF protein, which was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by SB 203580 (42% at 0.1 μm and 67% at 1 μm). TNF mRNA showed a sensitivity to the inhibitor that was similar to that seen for the protein (Fig. 1 C). In this experiment, LPS stimulation increased the levels of GAPDH mRNA. LPS is a very strong monocyte activator, and some batches of cells show up-regulation of housekeeping genes. TNF protein and mRNA showed similar sensitivities to the inhibitor at a concentration of 2 μm (62% and 65%, respectively) in two separate experiments with different batches of cells using a 4-h LPS stimulation (data not shown). Fig. 2 A shows the activity of p38 MAPK immunoprecipitated from lysates made from cells at various times after the addition of LPS. Activity increased 6-fold by 10 min and then returned to resting levels after 1 h. It was important to compare the degree of inhibition of p38 MAPK activity with COX-2 mRNA induction. Inhibition of p38 MAPK in monocytes by treatment with SB 203580 (which is a reversible inhibitor) was measured by immunoprecipitating its substrate, MAPKAPK-2, from cell lysates and assaying the latter's activity on hsp27. Monocytes were pretreated with the inhibitor for 20 min or left untreated, and cells were then treated with LPS for 10 min (Fig. 2 B, left panel). Monocytes were also treated with LPS for 4 h and either treated with the inhibitor for the final 30 min of stimulation or left untreated (Fig. 2 B, right panel). MAPKAPK-2 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates. At both time points,i.e. at the peak of p38 activation at 10 min and after it had returned to resting levels at 4 h, the MAPKAPK-2 activity was reduced by about 60% in cells treated with 0.1 μm and by 80% in cells treated with 1 μm. The degree of inhibition of the MAPKAPK-2 correlated well with the effect on COX-2 gene expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Certain forms of JNK, particularly the β splice variants of JNK-2, are sensitive to micromolar concentrations of SB 203580 (29Clerk A. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 30Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.H. Su M.S.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We chromatographed lysates of monocytes that had been treated with LPS for 20 min on a Mono-Q anion exchanger and measured JNK activity in the fractions eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient (Fig. 3 A). As is characteristic of the enzyme in lysates of activated cells (29Clerk A. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 35Kracht M. Truong O. Totty N.F. Shiroo M. Saklatvala J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2017-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), two major peaks were eluted. These were tested for sensitivity to SB 203580 (note that p38 MAPK itself elutes after the JNK peaks at about 0.4 m NaCl (2Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 3Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonsollamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar)). The activity of the first peak (which contains the short ∼46-kDa JNKs) was unaffected by the inhibitor at concentrations up to 10 μm (Fig. 3 B, left panel). The activity of the second peak (which contains the full-length ∼54-kDa JNKs) was unaffected by 0.1 μm but was significantly inhibited (24%) at 2 μm (Fig.3 B, right panel). The data shown in Fig. 3 B are means of three experiments on three different batches of monocytes. Because the peaks contain similar amounts of JNK activity, we estimate that total JNK activity might be inhibited by 10–15% in cells treated with 2 μm SB 203580. The inhibition of COX-2 expression by SB 203580 is therefore consistent with its effect on p38 MAPK and not on JNK. The effect of p38 MAPK blockade on both the protein and mRNA levels of COX-2 could be due to decreased transcription and/or reduced mRNA stability. We tested for an effect on transcription by performing nuclear run-on assays. Monocytes were left untreated or pretreated for 1 h with 2 μm SB 203580 and then further incubated for 4 h in the presence or absence of LPS. Nuclei were isolated as described in “Experimental Procedures,” and COX-2 transcription was measured by nuclear run-on assay. Fig.4 A shows a representative experiment. COX-2 transcription was stimulated 12-fold, and this was inhibited by 74% in nuclei from cells treated with 2 μmSB 203580. Data from three independent experiments are combined in Fig.4 B, which shows an average 5-fold stimulation of COX-2 transcription by LPS with a mean inhibition of 60% by 2 μm SB 203580. The inhibitor had a similar effect when the run-on assay was performed after only a 30-min (rather than a 4-h) stimulation with LPS (data not shown). These results strongly suggested that inhibiting p38 MAPK interfered with the transcription of COX-2. To examine the stability of COX-2 mRNA in human monocytes, actinomycin D was added to cells after 4 h of LPS treatment, and COX-2 mRNA levels were measured from the time of addition up to 90 min (Fig.5 A). The predominant 4.6-kb and the minor 2.8-kb transcripts decayed at a similar slow rate (t 1/2 = 110 min). Simultaneous addition of SB 203580 (2 μm) and actinomycin D to the cells after a 4-h stimulation with LPS resulted in a rapid decrease (t 1/2 = 30 min) in COX-2 mRNA levels (Fig.5 A). In cells that were not treated with actinomycin D or the p38 MAPK inhibitor, COX-2 mRNA levels were roughly constant for 1 h after a 4-h LPS stimulation (Fig. 5 B), showing that a steady state had been reached. The decay observed in cells treated only with actinomycin D indicated that in LPS-treated monocytes, COX-2 mRNA is continually being degraded and transcribed. When SB 203580 (2 μm) alone was added to cells treated with LPS for 4 h, there was a rapid decay of COX-2 mRNA that occurred at a similar rate to that for cells treated with the inhibitor and actinomycin D (Fig. 5 B). This indicated that transcription was not needed for SB 203580 to destabilize COX-2 mRNA. We found that the p38 MAPK inhibitor prevented the LPS induction of both COX-2 and TNF protein, and that the degree of inhibition of protein and mRNA for both were very similar. We concluded that there was little evidence for p38 MAPK regulating translation for the expression of both these gene products in primary monocytes. Our additional studies were restricted to COX-2, and these indicated that p38 MAPK is required for optimal transcription of the gene, and that it is needed for stabilization of the mRNA. The importance of this second finding is that it suggests a novel function for p38 MAPK that has not previously been considered. These conclusions are dependent on the inhibitor being specific for this protein kinase. The original description of SB 203580 suggested that it might be a highly specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK (11Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F."

Ourlin J.C. Domergue J. Maurel P. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 1143-1153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and IL-1β has been shown to suppress TCDD-mediated induction of P-4501A1 and P-4501A2 in hepatocytes (23Barker C.W. Fagan J.B. Pasco D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8050-8055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) of the observed suppression is unknown. It is known, however, that these cytokines induce NF-κB (25Ghosh S. May M.J. Kipp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a pleiotropic transcription factor that participates in many of the physiological responses that have been shown to be affected by xenobiotics, especially TCDD. The classic inducible NF-κB heterodimer typically consists of a p65(RelA) and a p50(NF-κB-1) subunit, with RelA being the subunit conferring strong transcriptional activation (26Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4582) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that NF-κB may mediate interactions between cytokines and the AhR signaling pathway. In this report, we demonstrate that these two pathways interact by physical association of their respective critical components, i.e. RelA and the AhR, and that this interaction is associated with mutual functional modulation of gene expression controlled by the AhR and NF-κB.RESULTSTo test the effects of NF-κB on gene expression of CYP1A1, we first investigated the effects of TNF-α treatment on the CYP1A1 promoter activity. For this, we transiently transfected Hepa1c1c7 mouse hepatoma cells, which express wild-type AhR, with a XRE-driven luciferase reporter gene (pGudLuc6.1). Treatment with TNF-α, which is a strong inducer of NF-κB, markedly suppressed TCDD-induced promoter activity as determined by the luciferase reporter gene assay, suggesting that cytokine-induced NF-κB could suppress the activity of AhR (Fig. 1 A). To further define the role of NF-κB in the observed suppression, we co-expressed pCMV65, which expresses RelA, with the pGudLuc6.1 reporter gene. Transfection of increasing amounts of the RelA expression plasmid effectively suppressed TCDD-induced XRE-dependent promoter activity (Fig. 1 B). These results demonstrated that RelA can suppress AhR-mediated induction of gene expression, suggesting that an underlying mechanism for the observed suppressive effects of cytokines on the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 expression (20Abdel-Razzak Z.

Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). We therefore performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to detect possible complex formation between AhR and RelA in vivo (Fig.2). Hepa1c1c7 cells were lysed with buffer containing Triton X-100. The presence of AhR·RelA complexes was detected by sequential immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis, initially using an antibody against AhR to immunoprecipitate the complex, and the presence of RelA in the complex was detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 A). RelA was detected by Western blot following immunoprecipitation of the Hepa1c1c7 cell lysates with either AhR- or RelA-specific antibodies, but not by immunoprecipitation with control antisera. The association of AhR and RelA was further confirmed with reciprocal immunoprecipitation with an antibody against RelA as the immunoprecipitating antibody, followed by Western blotting using the antibody directed against the AhR (Fig.2 B). This reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the physical association of AhR and RelA. Because the activated AhR is known to associate with the ARNT protein in the nucleus, we tested the possible association of the ARNT with the RelA protein. No significant association between the ARNT and RelA was detectable by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 C). Thus, AhR·RelA complexes appear to be distinct from the AhR·ARNT complexes associated with TCDD-induced transcriptional activation. No association between AhR and the NF-κB p50 protein, which forms heterodimers with RelA, was detected by co-immunoprecipitation (data not shown), suggesting that RelA·AhR complexes are also distinct from the classic p50/p65 NF-κB heterodimers. The results of reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation also demonstrated that AhR·RelA association can occur in the absence of exogenous ligand. The same type of ligand-independent association has also been observed in the interaction between RelA and the progesterone receptor (34Kalkhoven E. Wissink S. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. J.

To test the potential suppressive effects of AhR ligands on endogenous NF-κB activity, we treated Hepa1c1c7 cells with BNF and TCDD. BNF, which is an AhR ligand (38Blank J.A. Tucker A.N. Sweatlock J. Gasiewicz T.A. Luster M.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 169-172PubMed Google Scholar, 39Merchant M. Arellano L. Safe S. Arch. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1984; 75: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Twelve h later, the cells were treated with TNF-α for induction of NF-κB, and activity of NF-κB was determined by EMSA. Pretreatment with BNF and TCDD markedly reduced the induction of NF-κB by TNF-α (Fig. 3, Aand B). These data suggest that activation of AhR by ligand treatment can inhibit NF-κB binding activity. In further experiments, we tested the effects of AhR activation on NF-κB binding to the κB site DNA motifs using transiently transfected AhR and RelA expression plasmids (Fig. 3 C). COS-7 cells were utilized for these experiments, as they exhibited a lower basal NF-κB binding activity than the Hepa1c1c7 cells, allowing more efficient detection of changes in NF-κB binding induced by the transfected RelA expression plasmid (data not shown). Twelve h after transfection, cells were treated with TCDD for 18 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared and were assayed by EMSA for κB site binding activity. As expected, transfection of pCMVRelA led to readily detectable NF-κB activation (Fig.3 C, lanes 3 and 4) as compared with untransfected cells (lanes 1 and 2). Transfection of increasing amounts of AhR led to suppression of κB binding activity even in the absence of ligand (lanes 5,7, and 9). At each level of transfected AhR plasmid, treatment with TCDD reduced the levels of NF-κB binding as compared with untreated cells (compare lanes 5,7, and 9 with 6, 8, and10, respectively). TCDD treatment coupled with cotransfection of 2 μg of the AhR expression vector (lane 10) resulted in complete repression of NF-κB activity as compared with RelA-transfected cells (lanes 3 and4). These results demonstrated that activation of the AhR by ligand treatment suppressed NF-κB activity, either because of TNF-α treatment (Fig. 3, A and B) or transfection of RelA (Fig. 3 C). It is interesting to note that transfection of low levels of AhR actually increased NF-κB binding in the absence of ligand (lanes 5–8). In an analogous case, Palvimoet al. showed that cotransfection of the androgen receptor increased NF-κB activity in whole cell extracts (31Palvimo J.J. Reinikainen P. Ikonen T. Kallio P.J. Moilanen A. Janne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24151-24156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The reason for the increased NF-κB activity in the presence of low levels of AhR is not known; however, what is clearly demonstrated by these experiments (Fig. 3) is that activation of AhR reduced the binding of NF-κB to its cognate enhancer sequence.Figure 3AhR suppresses the NF-κB binding to the κB site. A, suppression of TNF-α-induced NF-κB binding activity by BNF. Hepa1c1c7 cells were treated with BNF (0–10 μm) for 12 h and then NF-κB activity was induced by TNF-α (1 ng) treatment for 1 h. The NF-κB activity was determined by EMSA. The radiolabeled κB(WT) oligonucleotide was competed with the unlabeled κB(WT) and κB(MT) to demonstrate protein binding specificity. B, suppression of TNF-α-induced NF-κB binding activity by TCDD. Hepa1c1c7 cells were treated with TCDD (20 nm) for 18 h, and NF-κB activity was induced and measured as described in panel A.C, AhR-mediated suppression of NF-κB binding by TCDD. COS-7 cells were transfected with pCMV65 and phuAhR. After 12 h, the transfected cells were treated with 10 nmTCDD. The cells were harvested 18 h later, and the nuclear proteins were extracted and assayed for binding activity to a radiolabeled κB-containing oligonucleotide by EMSA (16Zhang L. Savas U.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5174-5183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). *, indicates lanes (11 and 12) in which unlabeled oligonucleotide κB(WT) was included in the reaction as a specific competitor of binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The role of AhR in the suppression of NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activation was demonstrated in a transient transfection study in which transfection of AhR caused suppression of κB-directed promoter activity. Treatment with AhR ligand (BNF) markedly accentuated the suppressive effects (Fig. 4 A), consistent with the results from EMSA (Fig. 3 C). This transient transfection study (Fig. 4 A) also demonstrated that treatment with BNF alone, without exogenously transfected AhR caused suppression of NF-κB activity, suggesting that the COS-7 cells express AhR. We noticed that Hepa1c1c7 cells express high background levels of NF-κB activity. These cells are also known to express wild-type AhR. AhR ligands, TCDD and BNF, both suppressed the endogenous NF-κB activity in the Hepa1c1c7 cells (Fig.4 B). The effects of AhR activation on NF-κB transcriptional activity were further tested in an additional transient transfection assay (Fig. 4 C). BNF, as well as α-naphthoflavone (ANF), an isomer and a competitive antagonist of BNF (38Blank J.A. Tucker A.N. Sweatlock J. Gasiewicz T.A. Luster M.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 169-172PubMed Google Scholar, 39Merchant M. Arellano L. Safe S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 40Gasiewicz T.A. Rucci G. Mol.

Pharmacol. 1993; 120: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), were used as the AhR agonist and antagonist, respectively. BNF suppressed the RelA-induced activity of a reporter gene driven by κB enhancer sequences, whereas treatment with the AhR antagonist ANF completely reversed the BNF-induced suppression (Fig. 4 C), strongly suggesting that the repression is through an AhR-mediated mechanism. Thus, ligand activation of AhR repressed transcriptional activation by NF-κB as well as binding to the κB motif.Figure 4AhR-mediated suppression NF-κB transcriptional activation. A, suppression of NF-κB transcriptional activation by BNF. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pSVsporthuAhR, RelA, and pNFκB-Luc (Stratagene) luciferase reporter gene at the indicated amounts. 12 h after transfection, the cells were treated with BNF (200 nm), and 18 h later, the cells were processed for determination of luciferase activity. B, suppression of NF-κB activity by activating the endogenous AhR in Hepa1c1c7 cells with BNF and TCDD. Hepa1c1c7 cells were transiently transfected with pNFκB-Luc luciferase reporter gene, and 12 h after transfection, the cells were treated with BNF or TCDD for 18 h and luciferase activity was determined. C, AhR-mediated suppression of NF-κB functional activity by BNF. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pCMV65 and pNFκB-Luc, a luciferase reporter gene driven by κB enhancer sequences.

This mode of action limits the regulation of genes by the ligands of the AhR to those containing XRE enhancer sequences or “negative regulatory” sequences (silencers) (44Boucher P.D. Piechocke M.P. Hines R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5144-5151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, a rich body of literature indicates that ligands of AhR including polyhalogenated and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons cause a wide spectrum of toxic responses ranging from apoptosis to cell proliferation, suggesting that AhR is likely to interact with other signaling pathways to cause the observed toxic responses without acting through the XREs. It is now recognized that protein-protein interaction is an important mode of action for transcription factors to increase their regulatory repertoire. For example, it has recently been shown that a DNA-binding deficient glucocorticoid receptor mutant retains its transcriptional transrepression activity without binding to the glucocorticoid response elements (45Reichardt H.M. Kaestner K.H. Tuckermann J. Kretz O. Wessely O. Bock R. Gass P. Schmid W. Herrlich P. Angel P. Schutz G. Cell. 1998; 93: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar).In the present study, we demonstrated that the AhR and NF-κB signaling pathways interact by physical association and functional modulation. Although addition of TCDD did not significantly alter the apparent association between AhR and NF-κB in the in vitroco-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 2, A and B), the functional interactions between the AhR and NF-κB are clearly ligand-dependent as shown in the transient transfection assay (Figs. 3 and 4). Our data show that the AhR and RelA proteins have a cognate ability to associate. One model would suggest that unactivated AhR and NF-κB are sequestered in the cytoplasm and kept apart by their respective regulatory mechanisms, i.e. hsp90 associates with AhR and IκBs associate with RelA. This compartmentalization would serve as a regulatory mechanism to keep cellular signaling in order. The AhR and NF-κB subunits would then interact with each other upon provision of their respective activating signals (TCDD and BNF for AhR, and TNF for NF-κB). These signals would cause the dissociation of the hsp90 and IκBs from the AhR and RelA, respectively, allowing the association of AhR and the RelAin vivo. The data presented in Fig. 2, A andB, revealed that AhR and RelA are physically capable of associating with each other within total cell lysates, in which the entire cellular pools of AhR and RelA are exposed to each other, thereby potentially obscuring the effects of ligands. We believe that this specific association of these two proteins underlies the potential functional modulations that were shown in the subsequent transfection assays and EMSA (Figs. 3 and 4).The mechanism for the observed functional mutual repression is not clear. One possibility is that AhR and NF-κB RelA form an inactive complex, thereby causing mutual repression. Another scenario is that the mutual modulation between the AhR and NF-κB is mediated by a transcription coactivator, such as the p300/CBP. It has been found recently that the transcription coactivator p300/CBP serves as integrator for many signaling pathways (46Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar), ultimately leading to histone acetylation and activation of gene expression. Intriguingly, p300/CBP was found to associate with both RelA (36Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1997; 122: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the mutual antagonism found between the AhR and NF-κB signaling pathways also converges upon this central transcriptional coactivator. Competition between ligand-AhR/ARNT complexes and RelA for p300/CBP binding could affect the levels of transcriptional activation seen in these two pathways. Some nuclear hormone receptors have also been reported to repress NF-κB activity (30Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.A.

During ischemia and other forms of metabolic inhibition, activation of relatively few hemichannels will seriously compromise the cell's ability to maintain ionic homeostasis, which is an essential step promoting cell death. green fluorescent protein connexin carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone iodoacetate metabolic inhibition. Ischemia, hypoxia, and other forms of metabolic inhibition cause rapid disturbances in ionic homeostasis including intracellular Na and Ca gain and K loss that contribute to cellular injury and death (1Wilde A.A. Aksnes G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 29: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism is uncertain. Recent studies using dye uptake assays in immortalized cells have shown that some types of hemichannels open in low extracellular Ca (2Li H. Liu T.F. Lazrak A. Peracchia C. Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D. Johnson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Hemichannels are the precursors to gap junctions (for a review, see Ref. 3Laird D.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); two hemichannels aligned end to end form an intercellular communicating channel. If they are activated in nonjunctional plasma membrane, hemichannels are nonselective and exchange intracellular K for extracellular Na or Ca due to the asymmetrical intracellular/extracellular distribution of these cations. We have previously described a nonselective current that is activated by metabolic inhibition in isolated ventricular myocytes (4Kondo R.P. Weiss J.N. Goldhaber J.I. Circulation. 1997; 96: I359Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether activated nonjunctional hemichannels might be responsible for this current. The findings are positive, indicating that nonjunctional hemichannels may be involved in the pathogenesis of ionic disturbances during myocardial ischemia and hypoxia. Plasmid encoding GFP1(CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was fused to the C terminus of Cx43 using the polymerase chain reaction overlap extension method (4Kondo R.P. Weiss J.N. Goldhaber J.I. Circulation. 1997; 96: I359Google Scholar, 5Ho S. Hont H.D. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar). The chimeric product was subcloned and sequenced. Cx43 provided by Dr. Bruce Nicholson (State University of New York, Buffalo, NY) was subcloned into pCDNA3. Both native and chimeric constructs used the cytomegalovirus promoter. Transfection was carried out using the calcium phospate method (6Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The expression of Cx43-GFP was determined by examining cell monolayers grown on glass coverslips using a Nikon microscope fitted with a Xenon lamp and the appropriate filters (excitation bandpass, 450–480 nm; emission cutoff, <515 nm). Cardiac myocytes were examined for calcein and dextran-fluorescein loading using the same filters. Magnification was ×400 in the original slides, which were then scanned and assembled using an Adobe Photoshop/Macintosh G3 combination. Whole cell and single channel currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200A clamp amplifier and a Digidata 1200 data acquisition system using pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). For the whole cell clamp experiments, the patch pipette contained 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaCl, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for HEK293 cells or 115 mm cesium glutamate, 30 mm TEA-OH, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1 mmNa-ADP for isolated ventricular myocytes. The bath solution contained 140 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with or without 10 mm dextrose for HEK293 cells; CsCl was substituted for KCl for isolated ventricular myocytes. For the 0 Ca solution, CaCl2 was removed, and 2 mm EGTA was added (estimated free Ca, 1 nm). Metabolic inhibitors (which were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide as appropriate) or LaCl3 was added directly to the bath solution. For halothane, the appropriate bath solution was mixed with halothane and vigorously shaken. Excess halothane was suctioned off, and the halothane-saturated solution was covered with mineral oil throughout its use. Bath solutions were exchanged using a rapid solution exchanger with a 90% exchanger time of <500 ms (7Goldhaber J.I. Parker J.M. Weiss J.N. J. Physiol. 1991; 443: 371-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For single channel recordings, the patch pipette contained the appropriate bath solution described above. HEK293 monolayers were washed twice with Ca-free Tyrodes containing 2 mm EGTA (EGTA-Tyrodes) and then incubated in EGTA-Tyrodes containing 1% Lucifer Yellow for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were extensively washed with normal Tyrodes containing 1.8 mm Ca before imaging. Isolated adult cardiac myocytes (8Mitra R. Morad M. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 249: H1056-H1060Google Scholar) were washed by resuspension and centrifugation in EGTA-Tyrodes and then incubated in normal Tyrodes or EGTA-Tyrodes containing 150 μm calcein or 1% dextran-fluorescein for 30 min at room temperature. They were washed in normal Tyrodes three times before imaging. HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type Cx43 or Cx43 linked in frame at the C terminus to the green fluorescent protein (Cx43-GFP). In monolayers transfected with Cx43-GFP, the pattern of expression showed long lines of fluorescence that were consistent with the formation of gap junctions in regions of contact between adjacent transfected cells, in addition to some perinuclear and plasma membrane fluorescence (Fig. 1, D andF). These long fluorescent lines were not observed between adjacent nontransfected and transfected cells (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that the endogenous connexin-43 in the nontransfected HEK293 cells (9Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1519-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) either did not pair with the Cx43-GFP or was present at too low a level (9Toyofuku T. Yabuki M. Otsu K. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1519-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) to form detectable fluorescent structures with the exogenous Cx43-GFP. Cells transfected with GFP alone showed a homogenous pattern of fluorescence (Fig. 1 B) that did not transfer to adjacent nontransfected cells, which is consistent with the size permeation characteristics of gap junctions (10Flagg-Newton J. Simpson I. Loewenstein W.R. Science. 1979; 205: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To examine whether Cx43-GFP formed functional plasmalemmal hemichannels, individual HEK293 cells from nonconfluent monolayers were patch-clamped in the whole cell mode (Fig.2, A and B). Consistent with previous studies (2Li H. Liu T.F. Lazrak A. Peracchia C. Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D. Johnson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 11DeVries S.H. Schwartz E.A. J. Physiol. 1992; 445: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 12Ebihara L.

Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5836-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), the removal of extracellular Ca rapidly induced a large current, with a linear current-voltage relationship that reversed at −5 ± 1 mV (n = 4). Current amplitude at −80 mV averaged 838 ± 173 pA. No voltage- or time-dependent inactivation was evident when voltage clamps were used in place of the voltage ramp (data not shown). Replacement of extracellular Na and K withN-methyl-d-glucamine (M r195) shifted the reversal potential in the negative direction by only −7 ± 1 mV (data not shown), indicating a relatively nonselective current with significant permeability to large cations. The current was reversibly blocked by 68 ± 6% using the gap junction blocker halothane (Refs. 2Li H. Liu T.F. Lazrak A. Peracchia C. Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D. Johnson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar and 17Lazrak A. Peres A. Giovannardi S. Peracchia C. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1052-1059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar; Fig. 2, A and B). In nontransfected cells, removing extracellular Ca had a much smaller effect on the current-voltage relationship (Fig. 2 D). Current amplitude at −80 mV increased from 26 ± 6 to 179 ± 48 pA, which was presumably attributable to either the activation of endogenous hemichannels or the nonspecific effects of Ca removal on membrane conductance. To determine whether linking GFP to the C terminus of Cx43 artificially promoted hemichannel opening at low extracellular Ca, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with wild-type Cx43 and GFP fused to the β subunit of Na,K-ATPase (β NaKP-GFP) as a marker for identifying transfected cells. Individual fluorescent cells examined in the whole cell patch clamp mode produced similar linear nonselective currents in response to the removal of extracellular Ca, as with Cx43-GFP. Currents were blocked by La and, to a lesser extent, by halothane (Fig.2 D), possibly indicating that GFP linkage may modify halothane sensitivity. Single channel currents were recorded from HEK293 cells expressing Cx43-GFP (Fig. 2 C). With 1.8 mm Ca in the patch pipette, no single channel currents were observed (five cells). However, with low free Ca (1 nm) in the patch pipette, single channel currents were detected in six of nine cells transfected with Cx43-GFP, but in none of the nontransfected cells. Furthermore, halothane inhibited the channels, with the NPodecreasing from 0.28 ± 0.02 to 0.13 ± 0.03 (n = 3). The single channel conductance of the fully opened channel averaged 120 ± 25 pS. Several substate conductance levels were also observed, although their dwell times were too inconsistent to analyze quantitatively. Dye transfer experiments confirmed that the current observed in low extracellular Ca was due to functional hemichannels (Fig.3). HEK293 cell monolayers containing either all nontransfected cells (Fig. 3, A and B) or a mixture of transfected and nontransfected cells (Fig. 3,C–F) were exposed to nominally Ca-free media containing 1% Lucifer Yellow (M r 522). After 30 min, Lucifer Yellow was washed out with Ca-containing media, and the cells were imaged. Cells expressing Cx43-GFP showed the brightest dye uptake (Fig.3, C and D). Contacting nontransfected cells also showed a dimmer fluorescence, which is consistent with dye transfer from the adjacent transfected cells via gap junctions. No dye uptake occurred in nontransfected cells that were not close to transfected cells, suggesting that they did not take up Lucifer Yellow. The entry of Lucifer Yellow and the subsequent transfer to contacting cells indicate that the putative Cx43 hemichannels opened by low extracellular Ca are nonselective and are large enough to allow molecules of at least M r 522 to enter, which is consistent with the known properties of gap junctions (18Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Comparable results were obtained when wild-type Cx43 was transfected alone (Fig.3, E and F), although the successfully transfected cells could not be unequivocally identified. These findings establish that Cx43 forms functional hemichannels with typical properties of gap junctions. Linkage to GFP did not fundamentally alter hemichannel properties. We therefore proceeded to test the effects of metabolic inhibition. HEK293 cells expressing Cx43-GFP were patch-clamped (whole cell mode) with 1.8 mm[Ca]o and exposed to the metabolic inhibitors carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP; 10 μm) and iodoacetate (IAA; 1 mm) to inhibit oxidative and glycolytic metabolism, respectively (Fig. 2, Eand F). After ∼15 min, a large linear current developed that was similar to that induced by low [Ca]obut ∼2-fold larger (1720 ± 282 pA at −80 mV; reversal potential, −7 ± 1.5 mV; n = 5). This current was reversibly inhibited by 73 ± 8% by halothane and irreversibly inhibited by 97 ± 1% by 1 mm[La]o (Fig. 2, E and F). In contrast, in nontransfected cells, only a small increase in current from 39 ± 15 to 132 ± 49 pA was observed during metabolic inhibition (Fig. 2 H). To rule out a nonspecific effect of the metabolic inhibitors, we tested alternative combinations of metabolic inhibitors: 5 μmrotenone (a mitochondrial inhibitor rather than an uncoupler like FCCP) + 1 mm IAA or 10 μm FCCP + 10 mm2-deoxyglucose (a glycolytic inhibitor). Although the activation time course differed, a similar current developed in transfected cells (Fig.2 H). The combination of FCCP + IAA also activated the hemichannel current in cells co-transfected with wild-type Cx43 and βNaKP-GFP (Fig. 2 H). Halothane and La inhibited the putative hemichannel currents (Fig. 2 H), although to a slightly lesser degree. We also recorded single channel currents from cell-attached patches on Cx43-GFP-transfected cells during metabolic inhibition with FCCP + IAA (Fig. 2 G) with normal extracellular Ca (1.8 mm) in the patch pipette and bath. After a delay of 8–20 min, noisy-appearing currents were observed. Single channel amplitude was similar to that induced by low [Ca]o (5 ± 1.2 versus 4.5 ± 0.9 pA at −40 mV). However, the kinetics differed, due to a greater substate occupancy during metabolic inhibition. These are likely to be Cx43-GFP hemichannels, because the NPo decreased significantly from 0.33 ± 0.13 to 0.21 ± 0.11 (n = 3; Fig. 2 G) upon superfusion with halothane, and channel activity was never observed during metabolic inhibition in nontransfected cells. We have previously described a nonselective La-sensitive current activated by metabolic inhibition in isolated cardiac ventricular myocytes (4Kondo R.P. Weiss J.N. Goldhaber J.I. Circulation. 1997; 96: I359Google Scholar, 8Mitra R. Morad M. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 249: H1056-H1060Google Scholar). Because Cx43 is the most abundant gap junctional protein in these cells (19Manjunath C.K. Goings G.E. Page E. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 85: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we investigated whether this current could be explained by the activation of Cx43 hemichannels. To detect whether functional hemichannels were present, isolated myocytes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature (22 °C) in the absence of extracellular Ca with 150 μm calcein (M r 623) present. After washing out calcein with Ca-containing solution, ∼50% of the rod-shaped cells were fluorescent, indicating calcein uptake (Fig.4 A, bottom panel), as compared with only ∼3% of rod-shaped myocytes after incubation with calcein in media containing 1.8 mm Ca (Fig. 4 A, top panel). Dead myocytes took up dye under both conditions. No rod-shaped cells became fluorescent after exposure to dextran-linked fluorescein (M r 1500–3000) in either the absence or presence of Ca (Fig. 4 B), which is consistent with the known Cx43 dye transfer characteristics (M r cutoff, ∼1000). Rounded dead myocytes, however, readily took up this dye. Electrophysiological evidence also supported the existence of functional hemichannels in isolated myocytes. After the calcein dye uptake protocol, brightly fluorescent rod-shaped myocytes were patch-clamped (whole cell mode). The removal of extracellular Ca (with or without EGTA present) rapidly induced a current with a linear voltage relationship that reversed near 0 (n = 6; Fig.5, A–C). Current amplitude at −80 mV averaged 7 ± 1.8 pA/pF (n = 6). The current was reversibly blocked by 1.8 mm Ca or 2 mm La. To determine whether the endogenous hemichannels in myocytes could be activated by metabolic inhibition with normal extracellular Ca, calcein-labeled myocytes were exposed to rotenone (5 μm) in dextrose-free Tyrode's solution containing 1.8 mm Ca. After 8–10 min, a linear nonrectifying current developed that was fully blocked by 2 mm La (Fig. 5, D–F). The reversal potential of the La-sensitive component was 5.6 ± 5.2 mV compared with 3.9 ± 2.5 mV for the current induced by Ca removal. Myocytes underwent a rapid and progressive contracture as the current activated, indicating a severe disturbance of ionic homeostasis and intracellular Ca overload. We have previously shown (4Kondo R.P. Weiss J.N. Goldhaber J.I. Circulation. 1997; 96: I359Google Scholar) that this current is nonselective to molecules as large asN-methyl-d-glucamine (M r195), which is consistent with hemichannel properties in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2). The first major finding of this study is that both wild-type Cx43 and the Cx43-GFP assemble into functional hemichannels when heterologously overexpressed in HEK293 cells. The hemichannels open upon the removal of extracellular Ca, are nonselective and permeable to large molecules such as Lucifer Yellow (M r 450), and are reversibly blocked by halothane and irreversibly blocked by La. To our knowledge, this study is the first detailed electrophysiological characterization of hemichannels formed from heterologously expressed Cx43 and defines a convenient, useful assay system for future structure-function studies. The findings are generally consistent with previously described studies of heterologously expressed Cx46 (13Ebihara L. Steiner E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 15Paul D.L. Ebihara L. Takemoto L.J. Swenson K.I. Goodenough D.A. J.

J. 1995; 68: 1796-1803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and studies of native hemichannels in skate (20Malchow R.P. Qian H. Ripps H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and catfish retina (11DeVries S.H. Schwartz E.A. J. Physiol. 1992; 445: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Whether other connexins are activated by metabolic inhibition, however, is unknown. Our study also documents the presence of functional [Ca]o-sensitive hemichannels in normal ventricular myocytes, suggesting a novel potential explanation for the “Ca paradox” (21Rodrigo G.C. Chapman R.A. J. Physiol. 1991; 434: 627-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The most significant finding is the demonstration that endogenous and heterologously expressed Cx43 or Cx43-GFP hemichannels open when subjected to metabolic inhibition, even when extracellular Ca remains normal. In a beating cardiac myocyte, 10 open hemichannels producing a 100 pA (0.7 pA/pF) current at −80 mV would increase the Na influx by 75% (22Shivkumar K. Deutsch N.A. Lamp S.T. Khuu K. Goldhaber J.I. Weiss J.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the fully developed current (5 pA/pF or about 70 open hemichannels) would increase the Na influx 5-fold. This represents a tiny fraction of the estimated 2.6 × 106 junctional connexins in a typical cardiac myocyte (23Manjunath C.K. Page E. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: H783-H791PubMed Google Scholar). To the extent that the Na-K pump is unable to compensate for this additional Na load, intracellular Na accumulation and K loss result (22Shivkumar K. Deutsch N.A. Lamp S.T. Khuu K. Goldhaber J.I. Weiss J.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), causing membrane depolarization, intracellular Ca overload by reverse Na-Ca exchange, and possibly direct Ca entry through hemichannels. We cannot absolutely exclude that hemichannel density in isolated myocytes is artifactually increased by the isolation procedure. However, existing evidence suggests that gap junction plaques are pulled off intact with either one myocyte or its partner, rather than separating into plaques of hemichannels (24Severs N.J. Slade A.M. Powell T. Twist V.W. Green C.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 154-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The gap junction blocker halothane has been shown to have cardioprotective effects during myocardial ischemia (25Siegmund B. Schlack W. Ladilov Y.V. Balser C. Piper H.M. Circulation. 1997; 96: 4372-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which could be mediated in part by inhibition of the Cx43 hemichannel. Also, activators of protein kinase C have been shown to prevent Cx43 hemichannels from opening during the removal of extracellular Ca (5Ho S. Hont H.D. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the role of protein kinase C in ischemic preconditioning may be linked in part to the suppression of hemichannel activation.

https://openalex.org/W2029725115,"SHP (short heterodimer partner) is an unusual orphan nuclear receptor that contains a putative ligand-binding domain but lacks a conserved DNA-binding domain. Although no conventional receptor function has yet been identified, SHP has been proposed to act as a negative regulator of nuclear receptor signaling pathways, because it interacts with and inhibits DNA binding and transcriptional activity of various nonsteroid receptors, including thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors. We show here that SHP interacts directly with agonist-bound estrogen receptors, ERα and ERβ, and inhibits ER-mediated transcriptional activation. SHP specifically targets the ligand-regulated activation domain AF-2 and competes for binding of coactivators such as TIF2. Thus, SHP may represent a new category of negative coregulators for ligand-activated nuclear receptors. SHP mRNA is widely expressed in rat tissues including certain estrogen target tissues, and subcellular localization studies demonstrate that SHP is a nuclear protein, suggesting a biological significance of the SHP interactions with ERs. Taken together, these results identify ERs as novel SHP targets and suggest that competition for coactivator-binding is a novel mechanism by which SHP may inhibit nuclear receptor activation.

Nuclear receptors comprise the largest superfamily of eucaryotic transcription factors with more than 150 proteins identified (for review, see Refs. 1Enmark E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar, 3Beato M.

The capability of many family members to bind structurally diverse hydrophobic ligands is a crucial regulatory element for the transmission of extracellular signals into intracellular transcriptional responses. However, alternative ligand-independent regulation mechanisms have been identified (4Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and ligands may not exist for all receptors. Nuclear receptors usually modulate transcription of their target genes by binding to cognate promoter response elements. Moreover, cross-talk mechanisms, which do not require DNA binding, may allow nuclear receptors to influence the activity of other transcription factors (7Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J.

Nuclear receptors are modular transcription factors containing a variable N-terminal domain often exhibiting a constitutive transcription activation function (AF-1),1 a highly conserved zinc finger type DNA-binding domain (DBD), a variable linker region (hinge), and a multifunctional C-terminal domain responsible for ligand binding (LBD), dimerization, and ligand-regulated transcriptional activation (AF-2). Nuclear receptors can be subdivided into steroid receptors that mainly form homodimers and a large diverse subfamily of nonsteroid receptors including receptors for thyroid hormone, retinoids, and vitamin D as well as many orphan receptors, for which natural ligands have not been identified. Whereas certain nonsteroid receptors are monomeric or form homodimers, the majority heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). These heterodimers have been recognized to function as very dynamic transcription factors in which both subunits influence the other's capability to interact with ligands and cofactors (9Forman B.M.

Estrogen receptors (ERs) are unique steroid receptors because they exist as two different paralogues (encoded by two separate genes), ERα and ERβ (Refs. 18Kuiper G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M.

Gustafsson J.-Å. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar and references therein). Both ERs display quite similar ligand binding characteristics (19Kuiper G.G. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar) and comparable agonist-dependent transcriptional activities on “classical” estrogen response elements (EREs), consistent with the conservation of LBD/AF-2 regions implicated to be critical for these functions. However, differences have been reported with regard to their antagonist-dependent activation properties at AP1 sites (8Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar) which might be related to the lack of conservation in their N termini. These functional differences, together with their distinct expression pattern in tissues, strongly suggest that ERα and ERβ may play different roles in gene regulation. They have been demonstrated to form stable homo- and heterodimers with each other in solution and on DNA (20Pettersson K. Grandien K. Kuiper G.G. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1486-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 21Cowley S.M. Hoare S. Mosselman S. Parker M.G. J. Biol.

Nuclear receptors including ERs function in concert with transcriptional cofactors including basal transcription factors, chromatin-modifying complexes, corepressors, and coactivators (for review see Refs. 22Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Rain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar and 23Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Although various receptors in the absence of agonistic ligands bind to corepressors (24Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar, 25Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar), ligand activation is associated with structural rearrangements within the LBD/AF-2 domain, permitting the recruitment of coactivators. The predicted AF-2 coactivator-binding surface includes two highly conserved regions, namely the C-terminal helix 12 (AF-2 core) as well as N-terminal helices 3–5 including the “signature region” (Refs. 15Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar, 16Tanenbaum D.M.

Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar and references therein). In particular, the precise positional rearrangement of helix 12 upon binding of agonistic ligands seems to be a prerequisite for coactivator binding. Conversely, antagonistic ligands such as anti-estrogens are thought to induce a different conformation that prevents the association of coactivators (15Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z.

Common coactivators, which have been demonstrated to be relevant also for ERs, include, for example, p300/CBP (7Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A.

In agreement with the structural conservation of the putative coactivator interaction surface, many AF-2 cofactors contain short conserved LXXLL interaction motifs, referred to as NR box (30Kalkhofen E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 32Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Biological evidence for the involvement of p160/SRC-1 coactivators in, for example, ER-mediated gene expression comes from the discovery of AIB1 gene amplification in ER-positive breast and ovarian cancer cells (36Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar) as well as from recent SRC-1 knock-out studies (43Xu J.M. Qiu Y.H. Demayo F.J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O′Malley B.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1922-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In searching for novel proteins interacting with the LBD/AF-2 domain of nuclear receptors, an unusual orphan receptor has been isolated that obviously lacks a nuclear receptor-type DBD but contains a putative LBD (44Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 45Masuda N. Yasumo H. Tamura T. Hashiguchi N. Furusawa T. Tsukamoto T. Sadano H. Osumi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based on its small size and its ability to interact, like RXR, with various nonsteroid receptors, this orphan receptor has been designated SHP (short heterodimer partner). Its closest relative within the superfamily is the orphan receptor DAX-1, which contains a new type of DBD, interacts with the orphan receptor SF-1, and plays important roles in both adrenal and gonadal function (Refs. 46Crawford P.A. Dorn C. Sadovsky Y. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2949-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 47Ito M. Yu R. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1997; 390: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar and references therein). Although it is unknown whether SHP has ligands and can bind DNA, SHP has been suggested to act as a negative regulator of nuclear receptor signaling pathways by competition with RXR for heterodimerization (44Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because SHP has been shown to exert intrinsic repressor activity, active repression mechanisms may contribute to its inhibitory effect (50Seol W. Chung M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7126-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified ERs as novel receptor targets for SHP. We provide evidence for the existence of a novel mechanism by which SHP inhibits nuclear receptor activation, and we suggest opposing regulatory functions of SHP and AF-2 coactivators in estrogen signaling. —All plasmids were generated using standard cloning procedures and verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. The Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion constructs Gal-ERα LBD/AF-2 (aa 249–595) and Gal-ERβLBD/AF-2 (aa 168–485) were constructed by inserting PCR-generated fragments of the corresponding human ER cDNAs (8Paech K.

Gal-PPARαLBD and Gal-RXRβLBD have been described previously (51Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The Gal4 activation domain constructs GAD-SHP WT, D1, and D2 (see Fig. 1) were constructed by inserting PCR-generated fragments of the SHP cDNA into the EcoRI site (WT) or into the EcoRI/XhoI sites (D1 and D2) of GADGH (CLONTECH). GST-ERα (aa 249–595) was made similar to the Gal4 construct by cloning into the BamHI site of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-SHPWT was made by cloning a SalI fragment from the original yeast two-hybrid library clone (GAD10-SHP, CLONTECH) into theXhoI site of pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-SHP D1 and GST-SHP D2 were constructed by using the same PCR fragment as for the yeast vectors inserted into theEcoRI/SalI sites of pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-TIF2 (aa 594–766) was made by PCR cloning of a TIF2 fragment into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pGEX4T-1. His-SHP WT (aa 1–260) was constructed by inserting a PCR-generated fragment into the NdeI/SalI site of pET15b (Novagen). His-RIP140 (aa 747–1158) has been described previously (51Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). pT7ERα (aa 1–595) was as described previously (8Paech K. Webb P.

Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). pT3ERβ (aa 1–485) was made by recloning the human ERβ cDNA into the XhoI/NotI sites of pBKCMV HA (51Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). T3-TIF2 (aa 1–1465) was made by cloning the corresponding cDNA into the EcoRI/Xho sites of pBK-CMV (Stratagene). T3-RIP140 (aa 1–1158) has been described previously (51Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The following plasmids have been described previously: pSG5-based expression vectors for ERα and ERβ (Ref. 8Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S.

Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). pSG5 rSHPWT was made by cloning an EcoRI insert from the library cDNA clone (see above) into the EcoRI site of pSG5(Stratagene). pSG5-TIF2/GRIP1 was described previously (33Hong H. Kohli K. Garabedian M.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2735-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). pSHP-GFP was constructed by PCR cloning of full-length SHP (aa 1–260) into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH). SHP was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screening for proteins interacting with the rat PPARαLBD/AF-2 (aa 166–468) as described previously for the isolation of hRIP140 (51Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), except that a rat liver cDNA library (CLONTECH) was used. For the yeast two-hybrid analysis, HF7c (MATα) transformed with Gal4 DBD plasmids was mated with Y187(MATα) transformed with GAD plasmids. Diploid strains were selected for the presence of both plasmids. Interactions were monitored as growth on selective −His plates using different dilutions of yeast cells in the absence or presence of 1 μm 17β-estradiol or 1 μm 4-OH tamoxifen, respectively. Interaction studies were performed essentially as described (51Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Briefly, 35S-labeled proteins, generated by in vitro transcription/translation of either plasmids or PCR products containing a 5′-T3 promoter using a TNT kit (Promega), were incubated with approximately 1 μg of GST fusion protein in the absence (Me2SO) or presence of 1 μm 17β-estradiol or 1 μm 4-OH tamoxifen. The proteins were incubated for 2–3 h at 4 °C. For the competition assay, either purified His-SHP, His-RIP140, or TIF2 (which was generated by thrombin cleavage of the purified GST-TIF2 protein) was added to the binding reaction. Protein interactions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. 293 cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of F-12 medium with glutamine and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μl/ml penicillin, and 100 μl/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). MCF-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) media supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 μl/ml penicillin, and 100 μl/ml streptomycin. Both 293 cells and MCF-7 cells were plated onto 6-well plates in phenol red-free modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FCS, 100 μl/ml penicillin, and 100 μl/ml streptomycin. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with plasmid constructs using Lipofectin (MCF-7 cells and 293 cells transfected with Gal-ERαLBD) as instructed by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.) or by using DOTAP (293 cells transfected with ERα or ERβ) as instructed by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). Transfections were performed using 1.0 μg of ERE-tk-luciferase reporter or 0.8 μg of ERE-TATA-luc reporter, together with 0.2 μg of either ERα or ERβ or 50 ng of Gal-ERαLBD. Empty expression vectors were added to equalize total transfected plasmid DNA concentrations. After 12 h, the medium was changed, and fresh medium (without phenol red) containing Me2SO or 10 nm 17β-estradiol was added. 30 h after changing media, the cells were harvested. Cell extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity as described (20Pettersson K. Grandien K. Kuiper G.G. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1486-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 51Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol.

Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). For the PCR reaction, 1 μl of the synthesized cDNA was added to the reaction mix and amplified, starting with a preincubation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s in a PCR 9600 thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer). The oligonucleotides R1051 5′-AGGAACAAGACACAGACCATGAGCT-3′ and R1031 5′-AGTCCTTGGACGGCAGGAAGACGG-3′ were used for amplification of a 258-base pair fragment of SHP. The oligonucleotides used for amplification of actin were as described previously (52Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The PCR for actin was performed with an annealing temperature of 50 °C. After agarose gel electrophoresis and blotting to nitrocellulose filters, the PCR products were hybridized to the labeled 258-base pair SHP oligonucleotide prepared from the original SHP cDNA clone, using the same primers as for the RT-PCR. The actin PCR products were hybridized to an internal actin primer, according to previously described protocol (52Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Hybridization of SHP probe was performed at 65 °C for 1 h in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) followed by four 20-min washes in 2× SSC and 1% SDS at 65 °C and finally two 20-min washes in 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS. Hybridization of actin oligonucleotide was performed at 37 °C for 1 h in ExpressHyb hybridization solution followed by four 10-min washes in 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS at room temperature and finally two 20-min washes in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. 293-cells were plated on 6-well plates containing glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μl/ml penicillin, and 100 μl/ml streptomycin. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with 2 μg of SHP-GFP or with 2 μg of GFP alone, using Lipofectin as instructed by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cellular localization was visualized 36 h after transfection. The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature and stained with 0.001 mg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 10 min at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted on micro slides with FluorSave Reagent (Calbiochem) followed by viewing in a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. Photographs were recorded on T-max 400 film (Kodak). The yeast two-hybrid approach was used to identify novel proteins that interact with the LBD of PPARα, beyond the known dimerization partner RXR (for details see Ref. 51Treuter E. Albrektsen T.

We have previously shown that the Bgp1 isoform responsible for inhibition of colonic, liver, prostate, and breast tumor cell growth contains within its cytoplasmic domain two tyrosine residues positioned in immunoreceptortyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) consensus sequences. Moreover, we determined that these residues, upon phosphorylation, associate with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. In this report, we have further evaluated the structural bases of the association of Bgp1 with Tyr phosphatases. First, we demonstrate that Bgp1 also associates with the SHP-2 Tyr phosphatase, but not with an unrelated Tyr phosphatase, PTP-PEST. Association of Bgp1 and SHP-2 involves the Tyr residues within the Bgp1 ITIM sequences, Val at position +3 relative to the second Tyr (Tyr-515), and the SHP-2 N-terminal SH2 domain. In addition, our results indicate that residues +4, +5, and +6 relative to Tyr-515 in the Bgp1 cytoplasmic domain play a significant role in these interactions, as their deletion reduced Bgp1 Tyr phosphorylation and association with SHP-1 and SHP-2 by as much as 80%. Together, these results indicate that both SHP-1 and SHP-2 interact with the Bgp1 cytoplasmic domain via ITIM-like sequences. Furthermore, they reveal that the C-terminal amino acids of Bgp1 are critical for these interactions.

Biliary glycoprotein (Bgp),1 also known as C-CAM or CD66a, is a cell-surface immunoglobulin-like glycoprotein and a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family (1Barnett T. Kretschmer A.

Whereas oneBGP gene has been identified in human, two very similarBgp genes (Bgp1 and Bgp2) are expressed in the mouse (3Nédellec P. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Eur. J.

The most commonly encountered isoforms of the mouseBgp1 gene exhibit four extracellular Ig domains and cytoplasmic domains, which include either a short 10-amino acid peptide (BgpS) or a longer version of 73 amino acids (BgpL) (3Nédellec P.

Cell Adhesion and Communication Mediated by the CEA Family. 1st Ed. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1998: 155-175Google Scholar). In addition, the Bgp1 protein is expressed in epithelial cells of the reproductive system, where its expression is hormonally controlled (7Beauchemin N. Lin S.-H. Cell Adhesion and Communication Mediated by the CEA Family. 1st Ed. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1998: 155-175Google Scholar). Bgp1 is also present at the surface of endothelial cells and in hemopoietic cells, in particular in B cells, macrophages, and interleukin-2-activated T cells (7Beauchemin N. Lin S.-H.

First, it functions as an intercellular adhesion molecule (6McCuaig K. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 165-174PubMed Google Scholar, 11Rojas M. Fuks A. Stanners C.P.

This function requires the first Ig domain (13Cheung P.H. Luo W. Qiu Y. Zhang X. Earley K. Millirons P. Lin S.-H. J. Biol.

Second, mouse Bgp1 and Bgp2 behave as receptors for all strains of the mouse hepatitis viruses (4Nédellec P. Dveksler G.S. Daniels E. Turbide C. Chow B. Basile A.A. Holmes K.V. Beauchemin N. J.

Drzeniek Z. Markos-Pusztai Z. Wagener C. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2051-2057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chen T. Grunert F. Medina-Marino A. Gotschlich E.C. J. Exp.

Furthermore, we have recently shown that Bgp1 acts as a negative regulator of colonic tumor cell growth and that this role is dependent on the presence of the longer cytoplasmic domain of Bgp1 (21Kunath T. Ordoñez-Garcia C. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2375-2382PubMed Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported in human prostate and breast carcinoma models (22Hsieh J.-T. Luo W. Song W. Wang Y. Kleinerman D.I. Van N.T. Lin S.-H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 190-197PubMed Google Scholar, 23Luo W. Wood C.G. Early K. Hung M.C. Lin S.-H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recent reports have also suggested that Bgp1 behaves as a signal transduction molecule. Several physiological events promote the Tyr phosphorylation of Bgp1 on one or two Tyr residues within its cytoplasmic domain (Tyr-488 and Tyr-515). BGP becomes Tyr-phosphorylated by Src-like Tyr kinases in activated neutrophils (24Skubitz K.M. Campbell K.D. Ahmed K. Skubitz A.P.N. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5382-5390PubMed Google Scholar) and in human colon carcinoma cells (25Brümmer J. Neumaier M. Göpfert C. Wagener C. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1649-1655PubMed Google Scholar) and is a Tyr phosphorylation substrate for the insulin receptor (26Rees-Jones R.W. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4461-4467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we (27Beauchemin N. Kunath T. Robitaille J. Chow B. Turbide C. Daniels E. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and others (28Lin S.-H. Luo W. Early K. Cheung P. Hixson D.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have shown that Tyr-488 also undergoes phosphorylation when cellular phosphatases are inactivated by the pharmacological inhibitor vanadate. Whereas the physiological significance of Bgp1 Tyr phosphorylation remains largely to be defined, it has been reported that stimulation of Bgp1 (CD66a) in neutrophils leads to activation of Rac1, PAK, and Jun N-terminal kinase (29Hauck C.R. Meyer T.F. Lang F. Gulbins E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the amino acid sequences surrounding Tyr-488 and Tyr-515 of Bgp1 perfectly match that of an immunoreceptortyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM). This includes a phosphorylated Tyr residue preceded by a Val, Ile, or Leu residue at position −2 and followed by a critical Leu or Val residue at position +3 (30D'Ambrosio A. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 31Burshtyn D.N. Yang W. Yi T. Long E.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13066-13072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, as defined using mutated phosphopeptides, other residues such as those positioned at −4 as well as +1, +2, +4, and +5 relative to the Tyr residue within the ITIM might also contribute to the effective binding of SHP-1 with the natural killer cell inhibitory receptors (31Burshtyn D.N. Yang W. Yi T. Long E.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13066-13072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The ITIM consensus sequence is found in a number of hemopoietic cell-surface receptors such as Fcγ receptor IIB, the B cell accessory receptor CD22, and the natural killer cell inhibitory receptors. These receptors associate with the cytosolic protein-Tyr phosphatase SHP-1, which possesses two N-terminal SH2 domains, leading to attenuation or inhibition of Tyr phosphorylation-elicited signaling in various cellular systems (30D'Ambrosio A.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Optimal SHP-1 association with Tyr-phosphorylated proteins is mediated by both of two tandem N-terminal SH2 domains (34Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In most cases, once SHP-1 is bound to receptors, it catalyzes their dephosphorylation (35Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). As our studies related to Bgp1-dependent tumor inhibition were being conducted in mouse colonic carcinoma cells (21Kunath T. Ordoñez-Garcia C. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2375-2382PubMed Google Scholar), we questioned whether Bgp1 Tyr phosphorylation was conducive to any significant protein associations in this cellular background. We have recently shown that Tyr phosphorylation of the mouse Bgp1 cytoplasmic domain in CT51 mouse colonic carcinoma cells led to its binding to the protein-Tyr phosphatase SHP-1 and that this event required the presence of both Tyr-488 and Tyr-515 (27Beauchemin N. Kunath T. Robitaille J. Chow B. Turbide C. Daniels E. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In vitro binding assays confirmed that either one of the SHP-1 SH2 domains could bind to Bgp1 (27Beauchemin N. Kunath T. Robitaille J. Chow B. Turbide C. Daniels E. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We now report that, in addition to its interaction with SHP-1, Bgp1 physically associates with another ubiquitously expressed cytosolic protein-Tyr phosphatase, SHP-2 (36Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 37Feng G.-S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The association with SHP-2, like that with SHP-1, is dependent upon the expression of both Bgp1 cytoplasmic Tyr residues and the phosphorylation of at least one Tyr residue. Binding of SHP-2 requires a Val residue within the second ITIM sequence of the Bgp1 cytoplasmic domain. In addition, the N-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 interacts with Tyr-phosphorylated Bgp1. Furthermore, in reconstituting the association of Bgp1 deletion and point mutants with the Tyr phosphatases in CT51 mouse colonic epithelial cells and 293 human embryonic kidney cells, we found that the Bgp1 carboxyl-terminal region is critical for the regulation of its association with the protein-Tyr phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. Residues +4, +5, and +6 relative to Tyr-515 within the second Bgp1 ITIM are necessary for maximal phosphatase association with Bgp1. These results represent the first report that residues located outside the classical ITIM consensus sequence influence the in vivo binding of the Tyr phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. These three residues may consequently imprint a particular conformation on the Bgp1 cytoplasmic domain or may be involved in anchoring other Bgp1 cytosolic partners to the cell surface. Growth of CT51 mouse colon carcinoma cells, generously provided by Dr. Michael Brattain (Medical College of Ohio, Toledo, OH), and insertion of the Bgp1 cDNA constructs by retrovirus-mediated infection have been described previously (21Kunath T. Ordoñez-Garcia C. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2375-2382PubMed Google Scholar). Cell clones were selected from G418-resistant populations (G418: 1.5 mg/ml), and Bgp1-positive clones were identified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses and immunoblotting as reported previously (21Kunath T. Ordoñez-Garcia C. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2375-2382PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed with either cell populations or a minimum of two clones for each transfectant cell line. Pervanadate treatment of cells was performed by incubating transfected CT51 cells in α-minimal essential medium for 10 min at 37 °C with a solution of 10 mm H2O2 and 100 μm sodium vanadate (38O'Shea J.J. McVicar D.W. Bailey T.L. Burns C. Smyth M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10306-10310Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cells were collected from the dishes by scraping, followed by centrifugation and subsequent washes in the same vanadate-containing medium. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC CRL1573) and grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. 5 μg of each individual construct, cloned into the pXM139 plasmid, were transfected either individually or as a mixture (total of 20 μg) into HEK293 cells (5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish) by calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation (39Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 314-327Google Scholar). Calcium precipitates were removed after 18-h incubations, and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h and then lysed. The mouse Syp cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number L08663) was kindly provided by Dr. Gen-Sheng Feng (Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN) (37Feng G.-S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The C-terminal regions of mouse BALB/c 3T3 Syp and brain SHP-2 are different; to obtain a complete SHP-2 cDNA, theSyp cDNA was therefore used as a probe on a C57Bl6 mouse thymocyte cDNA library, kindly provided by Dr. L. A. Matis (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). Several cDNA clones were isolated and subjected to nucleotide sequencing (40Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar). Clone 9 encoded a 4-kilobase pair cDNA encompassing the complete coding region of 1778 base pairs identical to that found in a mouse brainSHP-2 cDNA (GenBankTM accession numberD84372). Cloning of the mouse PTP-PEST cDNA has previously been reported (41Davidson D. Cloutier J.-F. Gregorieff A. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23455-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced in the cytoplasmic domain of the BgpL cDNA by single-strand excision with M13K07 helper virus of a uracil-containing BlueScript SK− plasmid containing a 1.1-kilobase pairSacI-HindIII fragment of the BgpLcDNA (the HindIII site is from a BlueScript SK+ vector containing the full-length BgpLcDNA). The mutations Y488F, Y515F, and Y488F,Y515F have been described previously (27Beauchemin N. Kunath T. Robitaille J. Chow B. Turbide C. Daniels E. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The S503A mutant was produced in the same way using the following primer, creating a new EagI site: 5′-ACCCAACCGGCCGACTGCAGCCCCTTCTT-3′ (nucleotides in boldface represent the mutations). The Δ483 deletion mutant introduces a new stop codon at amino acid 484 and removes anAatII site (5′-TAACAAGGTGTAGGACGTGGCATACACTG-3′), whereas the Δ495 mutant includes a stop codon at amino acid 496 and a new BfaI site (5′-CTTCAATTCCTAGTAACCCAACCG-3′). The Δ510 deletion mutant has a stop codon at amino acid 511 and an addedStyI site (5′-TTCTTCTCCAAGGGCCTGAGAAACAGTTTA-3′). The Δ518 deletion mutant has a stop codon inserted at amino acid 519 and a new MseI site (5′-TTATTCAGAAGTTTAATAGAAGTGAGCAT-3′). Point mutations were also introduced in the C-terminal region of the Bgp1 cytoplasmic domain using an overlap PCR technique (42Vallejo A.N. Pogulis R.J. Pease L.R. PCR Methods Applications. 1994; 4: S123-S130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Two PCR fragments were generated for each mutant using a combination of common and specific oligonucleotides. The common oligonucleotide KM4 (5′-ACACAAGGAGGCCTCTCAGATGGC-3′) is located at nucleotides 1352–1375 within the BgpL cDNA and contains an endogenousStuI site, and a common T7 oligonucleotide (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) of the Bluescript SK+ vector was also used. Mutation of the three terminal Lys residues to three Ala residues was accomplished using the forward primer 5′-TCAGAAGTAGCAGCGGCGTGAGCATAA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TTATGCTCACGCCGCTGCTACTTCTGA-3′. For mutation of the terminal Lys residues to Arg residues, the following primers were used: 5′-TCAGAAGTAAGAAGGAGGTGAGCATAA-3′ and 5′-TTATGCTCACCTCCTTCTTACTTCTGA-3′. Val-518 was converted to Ala using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-TATTCAGAAGCAAAAAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCTTTTTTGCTTCTGAATA-3′. Mutation of Ser-516 to Ala was performed using oligonucleotides 5′-ACAGTTTATGCAGAAGTAAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTTACTTCTGCATAAACTGT-3′. All mutants were subjected to DNA sequence analyses (40Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar). A SHP-1 phosphatase-inactive mutant was generated by replacing Cys-453 with Ser (27Beauchemin N. Kunath T. Robitaille J. Chow B. Turbide C. Daniels E. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Phosphatase-inactive SHP-2 mutants were generated by converting Cys-459, present in the active site of the enzyme, to Ser. These mutations were created by the overlap PCR technique (42Vallejo A.N. Pogulis R.J. Pease L.R. PCR Methods Applications. 1994; 4: S123-S130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) using the following combination of primers: nucleotides 1353–1369 (5′-GCGTGTTAGGAACGTCA-3′) with nucleotides 1583–1603 (5′-TCCCAGCGCTCGAGTGAACCA-3′) and nucleotides 1583–1603 (5′-TGGTTCACTCGAGCGCTGGGA-3′) with nucleotides 2187–2200 (5′-CGCAGAGCAGTCTC-3′). The overlap fragments were cleaved withPflMI-HincII and substituted with that present within the full-length SHP-2 cDNA. All mutants were subjected to DNA sequencing to confirm their integrity. An anti-mouse Bgp1 polyclonal antibody, specific to the extracytoplasmic Ig domains of Bgp1, has previously been described (6McCuaig K. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 165-174PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies specific to the C-terminal regions of either SHP-1 (27Beauchemin N. Kunath T. Robitaille J. Chow B. Turbide C. Daniels E. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or SHP-2 were raised in rabbits using TrpE fusion proteins. A fragment from the mouse SHP-2 cDNA corresponding to amino acids 553–597 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pATH11 vector, and antibodies were raised against the induced purified fusion protein. Neither the SHP-1 nor the SHP-2 antibodies exhibit cross-reactivity. A polyclonal antibody raised against the non-catalytic portion of mouse PTP-PEST has previously been described (41Davidson D. Cloutier J.-F. Gregorieff A. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23455-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This antibody does not cross-react with the human PTP-PEST phosphatase. A mouse monoclonal antibody specific to v-Src was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA), whereas an anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) antibody (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The polyclonal antibody to the GST protein was a kind gift from Drs. Philip Branton and Joseph Lee (Department of Biochemistry, McGill University). CT51 or HEK293 cells were scraped from the dishes; collected by centrifugation; and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm EDTA, 1% Brij 96, 10 μg/ml protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone), 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris, and the protein content of cell lysates was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Samples of 0.5–1.5 mg of proteins were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h, and immune complexes were adsorbed onto protein A-Sepharose beads. Proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon membranes. After blocking unspecific sites, membranes were incubated with the anti-Bgp1, anti-SHP-1, anti-SHP-2, or anti-PTP-PEST polyclonal antibody or with the anti-v-Src monoclonal antibody (Ab-1), respectively. Detection of phosphotyrosine-labeled protein was performed with purified monoclonal antibody 4G10. Proteins were visualized by incubating the membranes with either 125I-labeled protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (ICN). GST fusion proteins containing various domains of the SHP-2 protein-Tyr phosphatase were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the indicated primers. The N-terminal SH2 domain fragment (amino acids 6–102; referred to as N-SH2 on Fig. 5) was amplified using primers 5′-GTGGTTTCACCCCAAC-3′ and 5′-TTCAGCGGGTACTTGAG-3′, whereas the C-terminal SH2 domain fragment (amino acids 112–208; referred to as C-SH2 on Fig. 5) was produced with primers 5′-GTGGTTCCATGGTCAC-3′ and 5′-ACTGTGCCCAGCGTCTC-3′. A fragment encoding the two SH2 domains (amino acids 6–208; referred to as SH2 ×2 on Fig. 5) was obtained using the first and last of these primers. Finally, the SHP-2 fragment (amino acids 6–594) was produced using primers 5′-GTGGTTTCACCCCAAC-3′ and 5′-ACGGGTCCTGGGAACGCTCGT-3′. The oligonucleotides were tagged with restriction cleavage sites, and the resulting PCR fragments were submitted to digestion with restriction enzymes and cloned into the pGEX2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cloned PCR fragments were subjected to DNA sequencing (40Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar). The constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21, and GST fusion proteins were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (27Beauchemin N. Kunath T. Robitaille J. Chow B. Turbide C. Daniels E. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For binding assays, fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (∼4 μg of fusion protein/binding reaction) and incubated with 1.0 mg of CT51 BgpL-transfected pervanadate-treated or untreated cell lysate proteins for 3 h at 4 °C in 1× lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl as described (27Beauchemin N. Kunath T. Robitaille J. Chow B. Turbide C. Daniels E. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After washing the beads four times with lysis buffer, adsorbed proteins were eluted, subjected to electrophoresis, and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-Bgp1 or anti-GST antibody. Quantification of the radioactive bands was performed on a Fuji BioAnalyzing System 2000. Values were estimated from a minimum of three independent experiments. Ratios of proteins present in immunoprecipitated complexes were derived by dividing the value of the band by the corresponding values of bands in the total cell lysate proteins. Differences were then expressed as percentages of values obtained with wild-type Bgp1. We have previously demonstrated that SHP-1 associates with Bgp1 in mouse colonic carcinoma cells (27Beauchemin N. Kunath T. Robitaille J. Chow B. Turbide C. Daniels E. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Another SH2-containing protein-Tyr phosphatase, SHP-2, is also recruited to the cell surface following activation of Tyr-phosphorylated receptors (36Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar,37Feng G.-S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). We therefore verified whether SHP-2 was expressed in CT51 cells and whether it also associated with Bgp1. None of the available antibodies directed to the mouse Bgp1 protein elicited Bgp1 Tyr phosphorylation. As no specific ligands for Bgp1 capable of provoking its Tyr phosphorylation in colonic cells have yet been identified, we therefore made use of the pharmacological inhibitor pervanadate, which is known to inactivate endogenous protein phosphatases, thereby mimicking activation of protein-tyrosine kinases (35Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 38O'Shea J.J. McVicar D.W. Bailey T.L. Burns C. Smyth M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10306-10310Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A Bgp1-expressing CT51 cell clone was subjected to pervanadate treatment; the cells were lysed with non-ionic detergent-containing buffers; and the Bgp1 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Bgp1 antibodies. SHP-2 was revealed by blotting with its specific antibody (Fig.1 A). SHP-2 was absent from immune complexes prepared from untreated cells (Fig. 1 A,lane 1), but was found associated with Bgp1 immune complexes prepared from cells treated with pervanadate (lane 2). Expression of Bgp1 and SHP-2 in the CT51 cells was monitored by immunoblotting cell lysate proteins with their respective antibodies (Fig. 1 A, lower panels). Therefore, upon Bgp1 Tyr phosphorylation, the SHP-2 Tyr phosphatase associates with Bgp1, presumably via its cytoplasmic domain. To evaluate the potential association of Bgp1 with SHP-2 in a different cellular system, we also performed transfection experiments in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were therefore transiently transfected with the wild-type Bgp1 cDNA in combination with theSHP-1 and SHP-2 Tyr phosph"

We have shown previously that activation of Trk A tyrosine kinase activity can inhibit p75NTR-dependent sphingomyelin hydrolysis, that caveolae are a localized site for p75NTR signaling, and that caveolin can directly interact with p75NTR. The ability of caveolin to also interact with tyrosine kinase receptors and inhibit their activity led us to hypothesize that caveolin expression may modulate interactions between neurotrophin signaling pathways. PC12 cells were transfected with caveolin that was expressed efficiently and targeted to the appropriate membrane domains. Upon exposure to nerve growth factor (NGF), caveolin-PC12 cells were unable to develop extensive neuritic processes. Caveolin expression in PC12 cells was found to diminish the magnitude and duration of Trk A activationin vivo. This inhibition may be due to a direct interaction of caveolin with Trk A, because Trk A co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin from Cav-Trk A-PC12 cells, and a glutathioneS-transferase-caveolin fusion protein bound to Trk A and inhibited NGF-induced autophosphorylation in vitro. Furthermore, the in vivo kinetics of the inhibition of Trk A tyrosine kinase activity by caveolin expression correlated with an increased ability of NGF to induce sphingomyelin hydrolysis through p75NTR. In summary, our results suggest that the interaction of caveolin with neurotrophin receptors may have functional consequences in regulating signaling through p75NTR and Trk A in neuronal and glial cell populations.

Neurotrophins are a family of growth factors that mediate the survival, development, and death of specific populations of neurons and glial cells (1Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 262-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Many of the classic trophic signals elicited by neurotrophins (nerve growth factor (NGF),1 brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin-3) require the presence of a specific member of the Trk tyrosine kinase receptor family (Trk A, Trk B, and Trk C, respectively (2Cordon-Cardo C.

After neurotrophin binding, Trk receptors undergo dimerization and transphosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues, a requisite step for activation of their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and coupling to downstream signaling pathways (9Jing S.

The pro-apoptotic effect of p75NTR may be mediated by generation of the bioactive lipid metabolite ceramide (11Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) that derives from the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) (15Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A.

Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Although it is well appreciated that p75NTR can regulate Trk-dependent responses (14Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 18Verdi J.M. Birren S.J. Ibanez C.F. Persson H. Kaplan D. Benedetti M. Chao M.V. Anderson D.J.

Neurobiol. 1994; 11: 1373-1385Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar), the role of Trk in regulating p75NTR-dependent signaling is not as well documented; nonetheless, it is supported by both biochemical and biologic observations. Although brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 effectively induced SM hydrolysis in PC12 cells, which do not express endogenous Trk B or Trk C receptors, NGF was ineffective (16Dobrowsky R.T. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Significantly, the inhibition of Trk A tyrosine kinase activity with K252a enabled NGF to stimulate SM hydrolysis. These studies provided the first biochemical clue that Trk A activation can inhibit some aspects of p75NTR signaling. Importantly, this biochemical observation has functional correlates relevant to the effect of neurotrophins on cell survival. An elegant study by Bamjiet al. (21Bamji S.X. Majdan M. Pozniak C.D. Belliveau D.J. Aloyz R. Kohn J. Causing C.G. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 911-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) demonstrated clearly that Trk A activation inhibited brain-derived neurotrophic factor-induced p75NTR-dependent death of sympathetic neurons. Van der Zee et al. (22Van der Zee C.E.M. Ross G.M. Riopelle R.J. Hagg T. Science. 1996; 274: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) reported that expression of Trk A was required to counteract the death-inducing effects of p75NTR in medial septum and neostriatal cholinergic neurons. Lastly, retroviral expression of Trk A in mature oligodendrocytes inhibited NGF-induced p75NTR-dependent apoptosis and blocked the stimulation of stress-activated protein kinases (23Yoon S.O. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that endogenous factors that regulate Trk tyrosine kinase activity would be expected to modulate interactions between neurotrophin signaling pathways.Caveolin-1 is a putative transformation suppressor protein that has emerged as a candidate molecule that may regulate the activity of cell growth pathways. Caveolin-1 is a member of a multigene family that includes caveolin-2 and caveolin-3 and is a key structural protein in the morphologic formation of caveolae (24Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar, 25Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar); for simplicity, our use of caveolin will be synonymous with caveolin-1. Caveolae are invaginations of the plasma membrane that are involved in the cellular transport of small molecules and are also considered as potential localized centers for signal transduction (24Okamoto T.

Additionally, most if not all cells contain caveolae-related membrane domains (CRDs). CRDs share a similar lipid constitution with caveolae but lack caveolin.Caveolin can associate with G-proteins (32Li S. Okamoto T. Chum M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nisihimoto I.

Importantly, the interaction of these proteins with caveolin has functional consequences on signaling because caveolin can inhibit the activity of nitric oxide synthase (36Venema V.J. Ju H. Zou R.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the interaction of caveolin with Trk may also have functional consequences on regulating cross-talk between the Trk A and p75NTRsignaling pathways. We demonstrate that overexpression of caveolin in PC12 cells prevents neurite outgrowth and blocks prolonged Trk A autophosphorylation in response to NGF. Trk A interacts specifically with caveolin, and this interaction dramatically inhibits NGF-induced autophosphorylation of Trk A. Moreover, similar to pharmacologic inhibition of Trk A (16Dobrowsky R.T. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), caveolin inhibition of Trk A signaling enables NGF to induce SM hydrolysis through p75NTR. These data raise the possibility that caveolin or caveolin-related proteins may regulate signaling through Trk and p75NTR receptors in specific neuronal populations.DISCUSSIONWe have determined that caveolin can interact with both p75NTR and Trk A, and that this interaction may regulate neurotrophin responses. In this regard, Trk A co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin in Trk A-PC12 cells that were transfected with caveolin. Trk A also bound specifically and co-sedimented with a GST-caveolin fusion protein expressing the full-length form of caveolin. Caveolin expression resulted in decreased ligand-induced activation of Trk A tyrosine kinase activity that markedly blunted the NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells transfected with caveolin. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that caveolin can directly block NGF-induced Trk A autophosphorylation in vitro. Thus, our data support that the effect of caveolin expression on NGF-induced differentiation may be due to changes in the magnitude and duration of ligand-induced receptor autophosphorylation mediated through a direct and inhibitory interaction of caveolin with Trk A.The lack of NGF-induced differentiation in Cav-PC12 cells cannot be explained by simple variability in the amount of Trk A immunoprecipitated from the Cav-PC12 cells, because Trk A levels were very comparable at all time points examined (Fig. 3). Additionally, because we observed some in vivo autophosphorylation of Trk A in the Cav-PC12 cells, it is unlikely that caveolin is preventing the binding of NGF to Trk A. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that caveolin may interfere with or destabilize the formation of stable Trk A dimers, leading to transient phosphorylation in vivoand blocking activation in vitro (9Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility that, in vivo, caveolin may recruit tyrosine phosphatases that rapidly dephosphorylate Trk A. However, the ability of the GST-caveolin fusion protein to prevent the activation of immunoprecipitated Trk A would suggest that a tyrosine phosphatase is not necessary for the inhibition of ligand-induced receptor autophosphorylation.A previous study has demonstrated that caveolin inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor autophosphorylation, likely through a direct interaction of an N-terminal region of caveolin termed scaffolding domain 1 with the epidermal growth factor receptor catalytic domain (37Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Couet et al. (37Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) have identified that scaffolding domain 1 of caveolin interacts with a specific caveolin binding domain present in the conserved kinase domain of many receptor-linked tyrosine kinases including Trk A. However, we were not able to demonstrate a strong interaction between Trk A and a caveolin fusion protein containing the scaffolding domain 1 of caveolin (less than 1% of the added Trk A bound to the GST-caveolin 61–101 fusion protein in contrast to a 29% binding to full-length caveolin). Thus, although tyrosine kinase receptors share a very similar sequence in this putative caveolin binding domain (37Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), differences may exist in how caveolin interacts with these receptors and affects kinase activity. Indeed, the idiosyncratic nature of the interaction of caveolin with tyrosine kinase receptors is exemplified by the association of the epidermal growth factor receptor and the insulin receptor with caveolin. Although the interaction of both of these receptors with caveolin is mediated by the interaction of each receptor's caveolin binding domain with scaffolding domain 1 of caveolin, caveolin inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor kinase activity (37Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) but stimulates insulin receptor kinase activity (38Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Meyers Jr., M.G. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar).Surprisingly, p75NTR, but not Trk A, was found to interact with caveolin through scaffolding domain 1. It is interesting that the cytoplasmic domain of p75NTR does not contain what would be considered a strong match to sequences that were identified as putative caveolin binding domains (41Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), although it does possess a related juxtamembrane sequence that may be responsible for this interaction. However, a peptide of this region was unable to totally compete the binding of p75NTR to full-length caveolin (data not shown), suggesting that other sequences within p75NTR may regulate the interaction of this receptor with scaffolding domain 1 of caveolin (Fig. 6). Thus, p75NTR and Trk receptors may interact with distinct domains of caveolin.The identification that both classes of neurotrophin receptors may localize to the CRDs of synaptosomal membranes (48Wu C. Butz S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3554-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and that caveolin and caveolin-related proteins are expressed in specific neuronal populations (49Henke R.C.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9520-9535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the interactions of these proteins may be relevant to neurotrophin signaling pathways. Indeed, similar to the pharmacologic inhibition of Trk A with K252a, caveolin expression modulated the inhibition of p75NTR signaling. In the absence of K252a, Cav-PC12 cells exhibited significant SM hydrolysis at all time points except 15 min after treatment with NGF (Fig. 8). This was the same time at which we observed a brief period of Trk A activation in Cav-PC12 cells. This pattern suggests that Trk A activation may quickly turn off SM hydrolysis in cells, and that caveolin, in turn, can regulate the ability of Trk A to inhibit p75NTR signaling. These results provide the first evidence that caveolin may be an endogenous modulator of cross-talk between tyrosine kinase and sphingolipid signaling pathways coupled to Trk receptors and p75NTR, respectively.It is important to point out that there is little or no data that support an overlapping distribution between caveolin (49Henke R.C. Hancox K.A. Jeffrey P.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 617-630Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 50Cameron P.L. Ruffin J.W. Bollag R. Rasmussen H. Cameron R.S. J.

Therefore, the physiologic consequence of the inhibition of Trk A by caveolin is uncertain but may serve as a model for the interaction of caveolin with other Trk family members. However, while this article was under review, it was reported that PC12 cells may express caveolin endogenously, and that caveolin expression increases during NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells (43Galbiati F. Volonte D. Gil O. Zanazzi G. Salzer J.L. Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Engelman J.A. Schlegel A. Parenti M. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10257-10262Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In agreement with this report, we were able to detect some caveolin in wild type PC12 cells, but only when using an antibody raised against the N terminus of caveolin (Fig. 1 E). At first, these results would seem incongruous with our findings because if PC12 cells express caveolin endogenously and caveolin inhibits Trk A tyrosine kinase activity, how do PC12 cells undergo differentiation in response to NGF? It is intriguing that Galbiati et al. (43Galbiati F. Volonte D. Gil O. Zanazzi G. Salzer J.L. Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Engelman J.A. Schlegel A. Parenti M. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10257-10262Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) reported that caveolin expression was up-regulated 2–3-fold by day 4 of the NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. We achieved an increase of similar magnitude by stable overexpression of caveolin in undifferentiated PC12 cells (Fig. 1 E). These results would be consistent with the hypothesis that increased expression of caveolin or caveolin-related molecules in terminally differentiating neurons may help to regulate signals originating from Trk receptors. Because the process of differentiation in PC12 cells is likely to involve multiple pathways, it is conceivable that caveolin overexpression in undifferentiated PC12 cells may not permit Trk A to become sufficiently activated to couple effectively to the various downstream signaling molecules involved in differentiation (14Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). However, in undifferentiated wild type cells, endogenous caveolin levels may be insufficient to interfere with the prolonged Trk A activation induced by NGF addition. As caveolin levels increase during the process of differentiation, the interaction of caveolin with Trk A may increase. Our data suggest that this interaction would promote more a transient phosphorylation of Trk A by NGF (Fig. 3) that may be sufficient to maintain survival. This would be consistent with the ongoing requirement for NGF activation of Trk A for the survival of differentiated PC12 cells (44Greene L.A. Aletta J.M. Rukenstein A. Green S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 147: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).In summary, the neurotrophin/p75NTR/Trk ligand-receptor cassette is an excellent model system for elucidating the mechanisms whereby interactions between multiple ligands and receptors dictate cellular responses. This ligand-receptor cassette is unique from other signaling systems in that both receptor components can signal individually or in pair in response to multiple ligands and direct very distinct biologic outcomes. These complex interactions necessitate a high degree of organization and regulation. The mutual interaction of these receptors with a caveolar structural protein that organizes, sequesters, and regulates the activity of critical signaling molecules adds an additional level of complexity to this system. These interactions may have important functions in dictating neurotrophin responses in specific cell populations, i.e. regulating the rate of receptor clustering, which may affect the activation of both tyrosine kinase and sphingomyelinase. Elucidating the biochemical mechanisms affecting the interactions between the sphingolipid and tyrosine kinase signaling pathways and their biological consequences represents a novel and emerging area of cell regulation. Neurotrophins are a family of growth factors that mediate the survival, development, and death of specific populations of neurons and glial cells (1Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 262-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Many of the classic trophic signals elicited by neurotrophins (nerve growth factor (NGF),1 brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin-3) require the presence of a specific member of the Trk tyrosine kinase receptor family (Trk A, Trk B, and Trk C, respectively (2Cordon-Cardo C.

After neurotrophin binding, Trk receptors undergo dimerization and transphosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues, a requisite step for activation of their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and coupling to downstream signaling pathways (9Jing S.

Conservation of protein sequence between yeast PLD and mammalian PLD1 begins at amino acid 325 of PLD1 (amino acid 308 of PLD2). We previously found that the nonconserved region (denoted the amino terminus) of PLD1 mediates responsiveness to PKC but is not required for PLD1's intrinsic enzymatic activity or for small GTP-binding protein stimulation of PLD1 (Fig.1).2 We also observed that deletion of either the amino terminus or the unique “loop” sequence from PLD1 increased its basal activity, suggesting that these regions in combination were responsible for at least part of the difference in the PLD1 and PLD2 states of activation in vitro.2 These findings prompted us to investigate the function of the PLD2 NH2 terminus, since PLD2 exhibits high basal activity and is not PKC-responsive. The amino termini are well conserved between the different mammalian PLD2 proteins but exhibit little similarity to the PLD1 amino termini, particularly over the first 80 amino acids. Weak homology is observed from amino acid 83 to 196, including a phox domain (Fig. 1, Ref. 2Frohman M.A. Sung T.-C. Morris A.J. Daniels L. Phospholipase D. Landes, Washington, D. C.1999Google Scholar) that has been proposed to mediate a wide variety of protein-protein interactions (23Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Many membrane-associated proteins require free amino termini to successfully interact with membrane surfaces, particularly if they encode prenylation sequences. PLD2 does not encode such sequences, and it was known from earlier studies that a free amino terminus is not required, since the protein appears to behave normally when fused to an NH2-terminal HA-epitope peptide (4Colley W.

To assess the potential role of the PLD2 amino terminus, a 308-amino acid NH2-terminal deletion analogous to the 325-amino acid NH2-terminal deletion previously described for PLD1 was constructed, transfected into COS-7 cells, and assayed for basal and stimulated PLD activities as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig.2 B, the PLD activities in lysates from COS-7 cells transfected by a control plasmid (Gbx-2, a homeobox protein) and stimulated by a variety of effectors, or transfected with PLD1 but not stimulated by exogenous effectors, are relatively low (see also Fig.2 D, where it is shown that anti-PLD antisera can detect the overexpressed but not the endogenous proteins). In contrast, lysates from PLD1-transfected cells exhibit a dramatic increase in activity when stimulated by mammalian ARF1, Rho family members, or PKC-α. Lysates from PLD2-transfected cells exhibit a high level of basal activity, which increases slightly (less than 2-fold) in the presence of the exogenous effectors, in particular ARF1. A portion of this increase can be accounted for by stimulation of endogenous PLD1 by the effectors. The remaining very modest ARF-dependent increase is variably observed both for PLD2 expressed in COS-7 cell lysates and for immunopurified native and baculovirus-generated PLD2 (see TableI and Refs. 4Colley W.

The modest and variable response of PLD2in vitro to ARF suggested that ARF stimulation of PLD2in vivo might play a more significant role in some unknown context.Table IStimulation of purified recombinant full-length and NH2-terminally truncated PLD2 by ARF1AdditionsActivityIncreasecpm−foldPLD2Δ(1–308)11941.0 ± 0.7+0.1 μm ARF1, GTPγS47514.0 ± 0.9+0.5 μm ARF1, GTPγS16,04713.4 ± 3.1+0.5 μm ARF113671.1 ± 0.2+1 μg of bovine serum albumin12501.0 ± 0.1PLD212,1301.0 ± 0.2+0.1 μm ARF1, GTPγS17,9751.5 ± 0.1+0.5 μm ARF1, GTPγS22,7801.9 ± 0.1+0.5 μmARF112,4291.0 ± 0.2+1 μg of bovine serum albumin93140.8 ± 0.3PLD2 and PLD2Δ(1–308) were expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as previously described (4Colley W.

Unexpectedly, deletion of the amino terminus of PLD2 (PLD2Δ(1–308)) eliminates 85% of the high basal activity in COS-7 cell lysates and renders the resulting truncated protein almost as ARF1-responsive as PLD1 (Fig. 2 B). No response to PKC-α was detected, consistent with the prior observation that the PKC-α-responsive region in PLD1 is in its NH2 terminus. Less anticipated was the observation that no response to Rho family members was observed (Fig. 2 B), although the site of interaction of PLD1 with Rho family members is in the carboxyl terminus (7Sung T.C. Roper R. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), 3T.-C. Sung, Y. M. Altshuller, A. J. Morris, and M. A. Frohman, unpublished results. and this region is well conserved between PLD1 and PLD2. Nonetheless, since it is extraordinarily unlikely that PLD2 would encode a cryptic capacity for response to ARF in vitro unless it was employed in some context in vivo, the finding suggests three potential hypotheses. First, ARF might stimulate PLD2Δ(1–308) indirectly by acting on some other factor present in the COS-7 cell lysates. Second, ARF might derepress full-length PLD2 inhibited via some unknown mechanism in vivo. Third, PLD2 might undergo truncationin vivo in some setting, generating an ARF-responsive isoform. We next examined PLD2Δ(1–308) activity in vivo (Fig.2 C). PLD2Δ(1–308) exhibited moderate activity in vivo in unstimulated cells, although less so than wild-type PLD2 (see also Fig. 6 A). Nonetheless, the relatively robust activity observed suggests that the truncated protein is subcellularly localized to sites containing activated ARF (in contrast to PLD1) or that negative regulatory regions active only in vivo are present in the NH2 terminus. Since PLD1 and PLD2 subcellularly localize to different regions (4Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) and since PLD1 encodes an in vivo specific negative regulatory region in its amino terminus,2 both hypotheses are tenable. Finally, we examined PLD2Δ(1–308) protein expression (Fig.2 D). Immunoreactive protein is observed near the predicted size of 66 kDa, in addition to proteolyzed fragments, which are also observed for wild-type PLD2, but not PLD1 or PLD1Δ(1–325). The proteolyzed fragments observed for PLD2Δ(1–308) are unlikely to be catalytically active, since both larger NH2-terminal deletions or deletion of any sequence from the COOH terminus yields inactive protein (data not shown). In the full-length PLD2 COS-7 cell lysate, however, catalytically active NH2-terminally truncated proteins could be present that could contribute to the partial ARF responsiveness observed. To rule out indirect effects of ARF1, we expressed PLD2Δ(1–308) in baculovirus and immunoaffinity-purified it using an anti-peptide antiserum (4Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Both full-length PLD2 and PLD2Δ(1–308) prepared in this manner are largely intact (unproteolyzed) (data not shown and Ref. 4Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, whereas full-length PLD2 is minimally stimulated by ARF1 (less than 2-fold), PLD2Δ(1–308) exhibits a 13-fold increase. The stimulation is observed at relatively low levels of ARF1 (0.1 μm), is GTPγS-dependent, and is not elicited by irrelevant carrier protein (bovine serum albumin). Since both the ARF1 and PLD proteins were recombinantly expressed and were purified, these data demonstrate that ARF interacts directly with PLD2Δ(1–308). PLD1 and PLD2 localize to different subcellular regions (4Colley W. Sung T.C. Roll R. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). At least six mammalian ARFs exist, and these also localize to different subcellular regions (reviewed in Refs. 24Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar and 25Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). There are three major groups of the ARFs, typified by ARF1, ARF5, and ARF6. ARF1 is the best characterized and localizes to the Golgi and ER. ARF5 localizes to late endosomes and may translocate to the plasma membrane under some circumstances. ARF6 localizes to the plasma membrane and possibly early endosomes. Localizations for the other ARFs are not well defined, and even the information reported for ARF1, ARF5, and ARF6 remains controversial. The mechanisms of action of the ARFs also differ. ARF1 and ARF5 are brefeldin A-sensitive and are largely cytosolic until agonist stimulation and subsequent GTP loading occurs. In contrast, ARF6 is brefeldin-insensitive, and the majority of it is plasma membrane-bound even in the absence of cellular stimulation. We previously reported that PLD1 is activated by mammalian ARF1 (mARF1) more effectively than by yeast ARF2 (yARF2) (Fig.3 A, Ref. 20Liang J.O. Sung T.-C. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33001-33008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We examined this response for PLD2Δ(1–308) and unexpectedly found that PLD2Δ(1–308) is more efficiently stimulated by yARF2 than by mARF1 (Fig. 3 A). The preference is not readily attributable to the deletion of the amino terminus, since PLD1Δ(1–325) behaves similarly to wild-type PLD1, i.e. it responds better to mARF1. This finding prompted the question of the identity of the mammalian homologue to yARF2. To address this, we examined activation by mARF1, mARF5, and mARF6 and found that mARF6 was a relatively poor stimulator of both PLDs but that mARF5 stimulated PLD2Δ(1–308) more effectively than mARF1 did (Fig. 3 B). This finding was examined in more precision by establishing a dose-response curve (Fig. 3 C). We confirmed that although mARF1 and mARF5 stimulated both PLDs effectively, mARF5 consistently activated PLD2Δ(1–308) at a greater potency than mARF1 and possibly with greater efficacy as well. In contrast, mARF5 and mARF1 stimulation of PLD1 were not significantly different. mARF5 stimulated PLD1Δ(1–325) slightly more effectively than did mARF1 in three separate experiments, but the magnitude of the difference was variable and considerably smaller than was observed for PLD2Δ(1–308) (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). The finding that mARF1 and yARF2 differentially stimulated PLD1 was used previously to define a central portion of mARF1 a"

Euglena precursors are co-translationally inserted into the ER, transported as integral membrane proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and from the Golgi apparatus to the outermost of the three Euglena envelope membranes, and then imported through the middle and inner chloroplast envelope membranes (13Sulli C.

The ancestral Euglenoid is believed to have been a phagotrophic trypanosome-like organism that engulfed a eukaryotic algae (10Gibbs S.P. Can. J. Bot. 1978; 56: 2883-2889Crossref Google Scholar, 31Gibbs S.P. Annu. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 361: 193-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Melkonian M. Verh. Dtsch. Zool.

The third envelope membrane is thought to have evolved from the host's phagocytic vacuole membrane (11Lefort-Tran M. Pouphile M. Freyssinet G. Pineau B. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 73: 44-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Melkonian M. Verh. Dtsch. Zool. Ges. 1996; 89.2: 71-96Google Scholar). Vacuolar protein precursors contain signal peptides and are transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where they are sorted into transport vesicles for delivery to the vacuole (1Corsi A.K. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30299-30302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Pryer NK. Wuestehube L.J Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 471-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). This signal peptide-dependent vacuole targeting system was probably utilized by the ancestral phagocytic trypanosome host and the endosymbiotic eukaryotic algae for vacuolar protein localization (32Schwartzbach S.D. Osafune T. Löffelhardt W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 247-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,33Melkonian M. Verh. Dtsch. Zool. Ges. 1996; 89.2: 71-96Google Scholar). During reduction of the endosymbiont to a chloroplast, the transfer of genes from the endosymbiont to the host nucleus required evolution of a system to transport the encoded proteins from the cytoplasm to the chloroplast. The signal peptide-dependent vacuolar targeting system coupled with the evolution of a unique Golgi sorting signal provided a specific mechanism for returning proteins to the endosymbiont evolving into a chloroplast within the phagocytic vacuole.The presequence of Euglena pLHCPII is 141 amino acids composed of an N-terminal signal peptide and a stromal targeting region containing a hydrophobic domain 57 amino acids from the predicted signal peptidase cleavage site (18Kishore R. Muchhal M.S. Schwartzbach S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11845-11849Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In vitro studies found that Euglena pLHCPII was co-translationally inserted as an integral membrane protein into canine microsomes, and the signal peptide was cleaved (18Kishore R. Muchhal M.S. Schwartzbach S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11845-11849Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A glycosylation site within the mature protein was not glycosylated, while a glycosylation site inserted within the presequence stromal targeting region N-terminal to the hydrophobic domain was. Upon deletion of the presequence stromal targeting region including the hydrophobic domain, the glycosylation site within the mature protein was glycosylated, indicating that this hydrophobic domain functions as a stop transfer membrane anchor sequence. Taken together, the in vivo transport studies (13Sulli C. Schwartzbach S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13084-13090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and these in vitro microsomal processing studies demonstrate that pLHCPII is transported from the Golgi apparatus to the chloroplast with the presequence oriented with the N terminus formed by signal peptidase cleavage in the vesicle lumen, the hydrophobic domain of the stromal targeting region anchored in the vesicle membrane, and the mature protein in the cytoplasm.The topology of a protein within an ER-derived membrane is determined by linear decoding of topogenic sequences within the protein during its translocation into the ER (15von Heijne G.

Since all of the presequences have the same topogenic sequences as pLHCPII, they all will be transported to the chloroplast anchored in the vesicle membrane with approximately 60 amino acids within the lumen. Upon fusion of transport vesicles with the outer chloroplast membrane, the N-terminal 60 amino acids of the stromal targeting domain will extend from the inner surface of the outer envelope membrane into the space separating the outer and intermediate chloroplast envelope membranes.The mechanism by which precursors are translocated through the intermediate and inner Euglena chloroplast envelope membranes after fusion of Golgi transport vesicles with the outermost membrane remains unclear. Sequence analysis indicates a common ancestor for the phenotypically diverse plastids of higher plants, green algae, rhodoplasts, diatoms, Euglena, and the cyanelles of glaucocystophytes (33Melkonian M.

Nature. 1998; 393: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Similar stromal targeting sequences and similar transport mechanisms are utilized for protein import into cyanelles (7Jakowitsch J. Neumann-Spallart C. Ma Y. Steiner J. Schenk H.E.A. Bohnert H.J. Löffelhardt W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the chloroplasts of plants (4Cline K. Henry H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16208-16215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the post-translational mechanism for protein translocation through two plastid envelope membranes evolved prior to the divergence of these different plastid types. This ancestral post-translational chloroplast protein import system was probably utilized by the photosynthetic eukaryotic algae that through endosymbiosis evolved into the Euglena chloroplast. Just as the ancestral prokaryotic preprotein translocation system was retained for thylakoid protein import during the evolution of a photosynthetic prokaryotic endosymbiont into a chloroplast (4Cline K. Henry H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the ancestral chloroplast protein import system was retained as the chloroplast envelope membranes of the photosynthetic eukaryotic endosymbiont evolved into the intermediate and inner membranes of theEuglena chloroplast (32Schwartzbach S.D. Osafune T. Löffelhardt W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 247-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Melkonian M. Verh. Dtsch. Zool. Ges. 1996; 89.2: 71-96Google Scholar). The bipartiteEuglena presequence arose by the addition of a signal peptide to the existing stromal targeting presequence (32Schwartzbach S.D. Osafune T. Löffelhardt W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 247-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Melkonian M. Verh. Dtsch. Zool. Ges. 1996; 89.2: 71-96Google Scholar), enabling the precursor to be transported first to the phagocytic vacuole-derived Euglena outer chloroplast membrane (11Lefort-Tran M. Pouphile M. Freyssinet G. Pineau B. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 73: 44-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Melkonian M. Verh. Dtsch. Zool. Ges. 1996; 89.2: 71-96Google Scholar), separating the host cytoplasm from the endosymbiont, and subsequently through the intermediate and inner chloroplast membranes derived from the endosymbiont's chloroplast envelope (32Schwartzbach S.D. Osafune T. Löffelhardt W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 247-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Melkonian M. Verh. Dtsch. Zool. Ges. 1996; 89.2: 71-96Google Scholar).Proteins are imported into higher plant chloroplasts at envelope contact sites, regions of association between the outer and inner membrane translocation machinery (8Schnell D.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Nielsen E. Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy has shown that the three Euglena chloroplast membranes are closely appressed in some regions reminiscent of higher plant envelope contact sites, while in other regions they are well separated (10Gibbs S.P. Can. J. Bot. 1978; 56: 2883-2889Crossref Google Scholar, 11Lefort-Tran M. Pouphile M. Freyssinet G. Pineau B. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 73: 44-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Regions of adherence between the Euglenaintermediate and inner membrane similar to the contact sites between the plant outer and inner envelope membrane have been identified in freeze etch replicas (11Lefort-Tran M. Pouphile M. Freyssinet G. Pineau B. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 73: 44-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These ultrastructural studies support the assumption that protein translocation through the Euglenachloroplast intermediate and inner membranes is mechanistically similar to post-translational protein import into the plastids of cyanelles, plants, and green and red algae.Based on the evolutionary origins of the Euglena chloroplast and available biochemical evidence, a working model has been developed for protein import into Euglena chloroplasts (Fig.4). It is proposed that the outer membrane contains a protein translocation channel that is open on one side to the lipid bilayer as found for the ER protein translocation channel (2Martoglio B. Hofmann M.W. Brunner J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1995; 81: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), while the intermediate and inner membranes contain an import apparatus functionally similar to the import apparatus of plant chloroplasts (4Cline K. Henry H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 8Schnell D.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Nielsen E. Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Euglena chloroplast precursors are co-translationally inserted and anchored in the ER membrane oriented with the N-terminal 60 amino acids of the stromal targeting presequence projecting into the lumen and the remainder of the precursor in the cytoplasm. This orientation is maintained within Golgi to chloroplast transport vesicle so that upon fusion of transport vesicles with the outer chloroplast membrane, the precursor will be embedded in the outer membrane with 60 amino acids of the stromal targeting presequence projecting into the intermembrane space. Interactions between the presequence and middle membrane translocation complex would alter the orientation of the presequence in the outer membrane, promoting lateral movement from the lipid bilayer into the outer membrane translocation channel by a process that is mechanistically a reversal of the lateral migration of a protein from the ER translocation channel into the lipid bilayer (2Martoglio B. Hofmann M.W. Brunner J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1995; 81: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Interaction between the outer and intermediate membrane translocation channels would form a contact site providing a pathway for precursor import from the cytoplasm. As the precursor moves through the intermediate membrane, the presequence would engage inner membrane import receptors forming a three-membrane contact site for translocation into the stroma. Formation of the three-membrane contact site is probably mechanistically similar to the formation of contact sites between the outer and inner envelope membranes of higher plant chloroplasts (8Schnell D.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Nielsen E. Akita M. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Presequence cleavage and, in the case of polyprotein precursors such as pLHCPII and pSSU, polyprotein processing by stromal proteases (21Enomoto T. Sulli C. Schwartzbach S.D. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 743-746Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) would occur during or rapidly after precursor import.Euglena is one of a number of organisms with complex plastids having three or four envelope membranes (10Gibbs S.P.

Cytol. 1981; 72: 49-99Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The diverse organisms with complex plastids are thought to have arisen through multiple secondary endosymbiotic associations between a heterotrophic or possibly phototrophic host and photosynthetic eukaryotes (10Gibbs S.P. Can. J. Bot. 1978; 56: 2883-2889Crossref Google Scholar, 31Gibbs S.P. Annu. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 361: 193-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Melkonian M. Verh. Dtsch. Zool.

The different mechanisms used to deliver and translocate proteins through the outermost membranes of complex plastids reflects the multiple secondary endosymbiotic events that produced the diverse organisms having complex plastids. The complex plastids of dinoflagellates are surrounded by three membranes (33Melkonian M. Verh. Dtsch. Zool. Ges. 1996; 89.2: 71"

We studied structural and functional coupling in this protein complex by limited (controlled) trypsinization of membrane fractions from mouse cerebellum, the predominant site for IP3R1. Mouse IP3R1 (mIP3R1) was trypsinized into five major fragments (I–V) that were positioned on the entire mIP3R1 sequence by immuno-probing with 11 site-specific antibodies and by micro-sequencing of the N termini. Four fragments I–IV were derived from the N-terminal cytoplasmic region where the IP3-binding region extended over two fragments I (40/37 kDa) and II (64 kDa). The C-terminal fragment V (91 kDa) included the membrane-spanning channel region. All five fragments were pelleted by centrifugation as were membrane proteins. Furthermore, after solubilizing with 1% Triton X-100, all were co-immunoprecipitated with the C terminus-specific monoclonal antibody that recognized only the fragment V. These data suggested that the native mIP3R1-channel is an assembly of four subunits, each of which is constituted by non-covalent interactions of five major, well folded structural components I–V that are not susceptible to attack by mild trypsinolysis.

Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1990; 5: 11-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We proposed that the mIP3R1 traverses the store membrane six times at the C-terminal membrane-spanning region (residues 2276–2589) (23Michikawa T. Hamanaka H. Otsu H. Yamamoto A. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Tashiro Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9184-9189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus both ends, the large N-terminal arm region (residues 1–2275) and the short C-terminal tail region (residues 2590–2749), face the cytoplasmic side. Deletion mutageneses showed that the mIP3R1 binds IP3 within the N-terminal 650 amino acids, independently of tetramer formation (21Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y. Yoshikawa S. Nakagawa T. Saitoh T.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Furthermore, residues 226–578 were found to be close to the minimum for specific and high affinity ligand binding, thus assigned to the IP3 binding core (25Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The C-terminal membrane-spanning region, the most conserved region within the IP3R family, would form an ion channel. It was also shown that at least the C-terminal part, including the membrane-spanning region, was sufficient for subunit assembly (26Sayers L.G. Miyawaki A. Muto A. Takeshima H. Yamamoto A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1579-1588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we asked how ligand binding to four individual binding pockets cytoplasmically extruding from a tetrameric IP3R1 channel would gate its channel embedded in Ca2+ store membrane, apart from ∼1,700 amino acids in the primary sequence. However, little is known of mechanisms underlying structural and functional coupling between IP3binding and channel opening.The cerebellar IP3R1 was degradated by Ca2+-activated neutral protease calpain to two major fragments of 130 and 95 kDa immunoreacted with anti-C-terminal antibody (28Magnusson A. Haug L.S. Walaas I. Østvold A.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that the C-terminal channel region forms a folded structure. Joseph et al. (29Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) reported findings in a study on structural features of IP3R1 with limited trypsinolysis of cerebellar microsomes. They identified two trypsin-resistant bands of 68 and 94 kDa which, respectively, contained IP3 binding activity and membrane-spanning segments. A notable finding is that of a large portion of the 68-kDa peripheral fragment associated with the 94-kDa integral fragment. These results revealed a close association between both N-terminal and C-terminal tryptic fragments despite the disconnection of peptide bonds. Thus, it had to be determined if such non-covalent interactions among these tryptic fragments would affect retention of structural and functional coupling between IP3 binding and channel opening.We have now examined structure-function relationships of mIP3R1 by limited trypsinization of mouse cerebellar membrane fractions. We found that native mIP3R1 consists of five major trypsin-resistant fragments (I–V), which were lined up on the entire sequence. All cytoplasmic fragments I-IV were tightly associated with the membrane-spanning fragment V, despite cleaving their peptide bonds, and such fragmented mIP3R1 channels retained significant IP3-induced Ca2+ release (IICR) activity. We suggest that the native mIP3R1 channel is an assembly of four subunits each of which is constituted by five major structural components, non-covalently but tightly associated, and that this structural coupling rather than peptide linkages connecting them would be a prerequisite for functional coupling in ligand binding and channel gating.DISCUSSIONWe provided evidence that (i) the native mIP3R1 consists of five major fragments I–V resistant to limited trypsin digestion, which means that there are four most exposed or disordered regions of the polypeptide backbone, all highly susceptible to the trypsinolysis and that there are five well folded structural components; (ii) all the cytoplasmic peripheral fragments I-IV are directly and/or indirectly associated with the membrane-spanning integral fragment V in a non-covalent manner; (iii) such completely fragmented mIP3R1 retains IICR activity comparable to that of the intact one, indicating the tight structural-functional coupling of these five split fragments; (iv) the inhibition of IICR by binding of the mAb 18A10 to the C terminus is due to physical interference of mIP3R1 channel gating (or coupling) structure, since the C terminus itself is not indispensable to IICR.Limited proteolysis provides direct evidence of protein folding; regions accessible to proteases occur in extended linker regions or loops often exposed on the surface of the protein between tightly folded domains and which would be expected to be almost entirely resistant to attack by low concentrations of proteases (36Price N.C. Johnson C.M. Beynon R.J. Bonds J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes : A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 163-180Google Scholar). Trypsin sensitivity of the mIP3R1 channel noted in the present study would reflect the overall conformation of the native one. Trypsin cleaves the carboxyl side of arginyl and lysyl bonds. Although the mIP3R1 has 321 residues of Arg and Lys that are scattered over the primary structure of 2749 amino acids, substantially only four sites/regions are highly sensitive to limited trypsinolysis, generating five major trypsin-resistant fragments. With prolonged incubation time or higher trypsin concentrations, fragment IV was readily proteolyzed, but the other fragments remained fairly stable, except that the C-terminal tips of the fragment III and V were labile. These results suggest that fragments I, II, III, and V would be tightly folded, whereas fragment IV would be relatively relaxed. Judging from size and position, the fragments II and V appear to be equivalent to the 68- and 94-kDa fragments, respectively, as defined by Joseph et al.(29Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).All members of the IP3R family consist of long stretches with extensive homology separated by short stretches with a characteristic divergency (37Maranto A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1222-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, all four trypsin hypersensitive regions were found to be localized in these variable regions. These regions would be flexible loops between the trypsin-resistant and folded structures. It should be noted that two hypersensitive sites, Arg-343/Arg-345 and Arg-922/Arg-937, are close to the alternative splicing regions SI (10Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Südhof T.C. J.

Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 32: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), respectively. Near the SIII, accessibility of trypsin would also be suggestive, since there is a potential site for protein kinase C (KLKS) (14Nucifora Jr., F.C. Li S.-H. Danoff S. Ullrich A. Ross C.A. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 32: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).The IP3-binding core stretches over two split fragments I and II. Both fragments have a relatively tight association and would cooperate for ligand binding. 3F. Yoshikawa and T. Furuichi, unpublished data. With further extensive digestion, fragment II further cut into at least two parts, N-terminal 29-kDa and C-terminal 38-kDa subfragments. Based on size and surface probability (predicted using a computer program), the carboxyl side of Arg-603 and/or Lys-604 are the most plausible sites for this second trypsinization in fragment II, which are likely to be in the vicinity of the C-terminal boundary of the defined IP3-binding core (25Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).Fragment IV contains Ser-1587 and Ser-1755 phosphorylated by protein kinase A and protein kinase G (13Danoff S.K. Ferris C.D. Donath C. Fischer G. Munemitsu S. Ullrich A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2951-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 38Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting our view it would be a relatively relaxed structure. CaM binds residues 1564–1585 (33Yamada M. Miyawaki A. Saito K. Nakajima T. Yamamoto-Hino M. Ryo Y. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As trypsin cut nearby, the carboxyl side of Arg-1581, Arg-1585, or Arg-1586, these residues are probably positioned on the surface. The immunophilin FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) binds to a Leu-Pro pair (residues 1400–1401) in fragment III (39Cameron A.M. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Fung E.T. Livingston D.J. Aldape R.A. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27582-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The region surrounding this site, however, was not so susceptible to trypsin digestion. It might be that the mIP3R1 prepared under the present experimental conditions attached FKBP12, which covered tryptic site(s) such as Lys-1395 and Arg-1407 near the binding site. Similarly, it is impossible to rule out that binding of unidentified auxiliary protein(s) to the mIP3R1 may occlude tryptic sites, resulting in the fragmentation patterns we observed.All of four cytoplasmic fragments I-IV were directly and/or indirectly associated with the membrane-spanning fragment V in a non-covalent manner. It has been reported about many proteins that split complemental fragments of a protein, generated by limited proteolysis, can be associated with each other to form a functional structure as does the intact protein (40Taniuchi H. Parr G.R. Juillerat M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 185-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These inter-fragment interactions probably contribute to folding, stability, and functions of native proteins in general. We propose that the native mIP3R1 is composed of four subunits each of which is a non-covalent and tight assembly of five well folded components I–V, corresponding to the tryptic fragments I–V, thus the mIP3R1-channel complex forms a compact structure. This view is supported by electron microscopic studies that a single native IP3R1 complex forms a compact square-shaped conformation (41Takei K. Mignery G.A. Mugnaini E. Südhof T.C. De Camilli P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 327-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 42Katayama E. Funahashi H. Michikawa T. Shiraishi T. Ikemoto T. Iino M. Hirosawa K. Mikoshiba K.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), i.e.IP3 binds to the N-terminal ligand-binding region, the information of which transduced to opening of the C-terminal Ca2+ channel gate, leading to release into the cytoplasm of another second messenger Ca2+ from stores. Mignery and Südhof (24Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) reported that the N-terminal 1803 residues molecularly expressed displayed a mobility shift (apparent decrease in mass of >50 kDa) on gel filtration chromatography in the presence of IP3, suggesting a conformational change in the cytoplasmic region upon ligand binding. Joseph et al. (29Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), however, reported that the preincubation of cerebellar microsomes with IP3 does not affect the proteolytic pattern of the IP3R1, determined using two different anti-IP3R1 antibodies, the epitopes of which are the C terminus and residues 401–414. This means that a large conformational change probably does not occur at least within the components II and V (the 68- and 94-kDa fragments in their report). We found that the trypsin-fragmented mIP3R1 retains IICR activity and that functional coupling probably occurs through non-covalent interactions in these five structural components, independently of peptide linkages connecting them. Therefore, the gating signal triggered by IP3 binding may (i) change in relative position of each component including the binding components (I and II) and the channel component (V), and/or (ii) a series of propagation of conformational changes from one component to the next through interfaces, in which case the change would be delicate regarding II and V at least. We asked whether fragments I–IV were released into the soluble fraction by such putative conformational changes triggered by IP3 binding. However, either in the presence or the absence of 1 μmIP3, all the fragments were precipitated by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated by the 18A10 (data not shown). The function of the mIP3R1 channel is well regulated by a variety of modulatory systems as follows: phosphorylation with various protein kinases, binding to various modulators such as Ca2+, ATP, CaM, and FKBP12, etc. The functional sites for these modulatory systems are scattered chiefly in components III, IVa, and V (Fig. 1). We think that some aspects in these modulations would be related with subtle adjustments of the inter-component interactions, leading to alteration in configuration of the mIP3R1 channel and then in the structural-functional coupling level. The IICR activities measured in the present study reflect not only the mIP3R1 itself but also other molecules such as the SERCA/Ca2+ pump, the IP3 metabolic enzymes such as IP3 5-phosphatase and IP3 3-kinase, and IP3R1 modulatory proteins such as CaM and FKBP12, etc. Possible involvement(s) of changes of these molecules by trypsinolysis in IICR activity would need to be ruled out.IP3R shares a few fragmentary homologies with another intracellular Ca2+ release channel, ryanodine receptor (RyR) (9Furuichi T.

The structural similarity probably relates to functional similarities as intracellular Ca2+ release channels are common to the two families. A series of limited proteolyses of the skeletal muscle RyR have been carried out with trypsin (34Shoshan-Barmatz V. Zarka A. J. Biol.

The proteolytic fragments were also tightly associated in a non-covalent manner, and the fragmented RyR channel retained CICR activity. These findings suggest that these interactions among the folding components resistant to proteolysis play an important role in formation of functional configuration, as the intracellular Ca2+ release channel. Whether there is any similarity in structural-functional coupling for the ligand-gating mechanism between the IP3R-IICR channels and the RyR-CICR channels remains to be determined, although specific ligands differ between them (IP3 versus Ca2+). In the case of IP3R the IP3 ligand-binding site is far from the channel region in the primary sequence (although the distance in the tertiary structure is yet unclear), whereas in the case of RyR the region for Ca2+ activation is close to the channel region (53Chen S.R.W.

However, it is well known that the liganding IP3 is essential but not sufficient for the gating of the IP3R channel, and the concomitant action of cytosolic Ca2+ at stimulatory levels is requisite for it as “co-agonist.” It should be noted that the position of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ site for IP3R, determined by 45Ca2+ overlay experiment (57Sienaert I.

Extracellular stimuli can activate hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, a component of the plasma membrane, the result being production of an intracellular second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)1 (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). IP3 diffuses into the cytoplasm and mediates the release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ storage organella, chiefly the endoplasmic reticulum, by binding to its receptor (IP3R). IP3R is a tetrameric intracellular IP3-gated Ca2+ release channel (2Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning has revealed that there are at least three distinct types of IP3R in mammals (3Furuichi T. Khoda K. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Curr. Opin.

Acetyltransferases catalyze the acetylation of their specific substrates using the cofactor acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA).

Molecular Cytology of Escherichia coli. Academic Press, Inc., New York1985: 77-119Google Scholar, 5Park J.T. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

In eukaryotes, it serves as the substrate of chitin synthase and is also utilized for the GlcNAc moiety of N-linked glycosylation as well as the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor of cellular proteins (7Cabib E. Roberts R. Bowers B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 763-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 8Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc starts from the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) into glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) by glutamine:Fru-6-P amidotransferase. Then, GlcN-6-P is converted into glucosamine 1-phosphate (GlcN-1-P) by phosphoglucosamine (phospho-GlcN) mutase. Acetylation occurs on GlcN-1-P, and the resulting N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P) is uridylated by UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase (9Dobrogosz W.J. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), respectively. In addition, the product of the E. coli GlmU gene is a bifunctional protein having both GlcN-1-P acetyltransferase and UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase activities (16Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6150-6157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5788-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, GFA1 andAGM1 are responsible for the synthesis of GlcN-6-P from Fru-6-P and for the interconversion of N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6-P) and GlcNAc-1-P, respectively (18Watzele G. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8753-8758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hofmann M. Boles E. Zimmermann F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As Agm1p utilizes phospho-N-acetylglucosamine (phospho-GlcNAc) as the substrate, it has been assumed that acetyl transfer precedes the mutase reaction, and, therefore, GlcN-6-P would serve as the recipient of the acetyl moiety (19Hofmann M. Boles E. Zimmermann F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In our previous paper, we reported that the yeast UAP1 gene encodes UDP-GlcNAc pryophosphorylase and demonstrated that, unlike the product of the E. coli GlmUgene, phospho-GlcN acetyltransferase activity is not intrinsic in the yeast Uap1 protein (20Mio T. Yabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14392-14397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The human UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase was also identified and shown to be highly related to the yeast enzyme. Curiously, the human enzyme turned out to be identical to the antigen of male infertility patients (20Mio T. Yabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14392-14397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Diekman A.B. Goldberg E. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27055-27057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the human enzyme recognizes both UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc, but the deletion of 17 amino acids in the C-terminal region, which occurs physiologically by alternative splicing, alters its substrate specificity (22Wang-Gillam A. Pastuszak I. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27055-27057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the S. cerevisiae gene for phospho-GlcN acetyltransferase. The enzyme utilizes GlcN-6-P as the substrate, and its deletion is lethal, leading to a morphology similar to those observed in UAP1- and AGM1-deficient cells. The important residues for the catalysis are proposed on the basis of mutation analysis. The entire open reading frame (ORF)1 ofScGNA1 (YFL107C) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the S. cerevisiae genomic DNA extracted from strain A451 (MATα can1 aro7 can1 leu2 trp1 ura3) as a template. It was then cloned at the XbaI site of pUC18 or pYEUra3 (Toyobo), generating pUC-ScGNA1 and pYEU-ScGNA1, respectively. Primers used for polymerase chain reaction were 5′-AAGGATCCAGCTTACCCGATGGATTTTATATA-3′ and 5′-AAGAATTCCTATTTTCTAATTTGCATTTCCAC-3′. The Candida albicanshomolog of ScGNA1 was cloned by screening a C. albicans genomic DNA library as a probe using the 0.2-kilobase fragment of the C. albicans genomic DNA, whose sequence was available in the C. albicans data base and was found to be related to YFL017C. The filters were hybridized and washed under stringent conditions (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 5 × SSC (1 × SSC contains 150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 25% formamide at 42 °C for hybridization; 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for washing). After the third screening, DNA was extracted from bacterial cells that were strongly hybridized with the probe DNA, and the insert DNA was cloned between theBamHI and SalI sites of pUC19 for further plasmid construction. Radiolabeling of the probe DNA was performed by the random priming method using [α-32P]dCTP (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-13.77Google Scholar), and DNA sequencing was carried out as described elsewhere (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-13.77Google Scholar). Construction of the C. albicans genomic DNA library was already reported (24Yamada-Okabe T. Shimmi O. Doi R. Mizumoto K. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The coding regions of ScGNA1 and CaGNA1 were cloned between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (25Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmids were transfected into E. coli JM109 to express the recombinant yeast proteins as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Induction and expression of the recombinant Gna1 proteins was carried out with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described (24Yamada-Okabe T. Shimmi O. Doi R. Mizumoto K. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,25Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). At 4 h after the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the bacterial cells were harvested, suspended in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 10%(v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed by sonication. After cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min, GST-Gna1 fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B column chromatography, as described (25Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar), and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The primers used for amplifying the CaGNA1 ORF were 5′-AAGGATCCTTACCACAAGGTTATACATTCAGA-3′ and 5′-AAGAATTCCTAGAATCTACATACCATTTCAAC-3′. Because CoA reacts with 2-nitrobenzoic acid and releases 4-nitrothiophenolate (26Gehring A.M. Lees W.J. Mindiola D.J. Walsh C.T. Brown E.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,27Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), an assay for phospho-GlcN acetyltransferase was performed in 50 μl of a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μmGlcN-6-P, 200 μm Ac-CoA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and approximately 0.1 μg of the recombinant GST-Gna1p fusion protein. After incubation at 30 °C for the indicated time, the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of a solution containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 6.4 m guanidine hydrochloride and then 50 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 20 μm 2-nitrobenzoic acid. The amounts of CoA produced by the Gna1 protein were estimated from that of 4-nitrothiophenolate by measuring the optimal density at 412 nm. The UDP-GlcNAc synthesis assay was carried out in a 20 μl standard reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μmGlcN-6-P, 200 μm Ac-CoA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 μm [α-32P]UTP (specific activity, 1 × 103 cpm/pmol) and approximately 0.1 μg each of Gna1, Agm1, and Uap1 proteins at 30 °C for 10 min. Two microliters of the each reaction mixture were spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates, and nucleotide sugars were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in a solution that was prepared by mixing 6 g of Na2B4O7·10H2O, 3 g of H3BO3, and 25 ml of ethylene glycol in 70 ml of H2O (28Randerath K. Randerath E. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 13: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The radioactive spots were visualized by autoradiography. The entire ORF ofScGNA1 was cloned between the BamHI and SalI sites of pUC18 and pYEUra3 (downstream of the GAL1promoter), generating pUC-ScGNA1 and pYEU-ScGNA1, respectively. Then, the 133-base pair EcoT14I-EcoT14I region of theScGNA1 ORF in pUC-ScGNA1 was excised and replaced by theLEU2 gene, generating pUC-ScGNA1L. The haploid strain YPH499 (MATa ura3, lys2, ade2,trp1, his3, leu2) was transformed with pYEU-ScGNA1, and ura+ transformants were further transfected with pUC-ScGNA1L that had been digested withSalI and SmaI. The resulting ura+leu+ transformants, which grew in galactose medium but not in glucose medium, were collected and used as gna1Δ strain (MATa ura3, lys2, ade2,trp1, his3, leu2 gna1Δ::LEU2 GNA1-URA3). The S. cerevisiae uap1Δ null mutant (MATa ura3, lys2, ade2,trp1, his3, leu2 uap1Δ::LEU2 UAP1-URA3) and agm1Δ null mutant (MATa ura3, lys2, ade2, trp1,his3, leu2 agm1Δ::LEU2 AGM1-URA3) strains were already described in the previous paper (20Mio T. Yabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14392-14397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To test the ability of CaGNA to complementScGNA1, the entire ORF of CaGNA1 was cloned at the BamHI site (downstream of the ADH1 promoter) of pGBT9-T (24Yamada-Okabe T. Shimmi O. Doi R. Mizumoto K. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the transcription of CaGNA1 from this plasmid was under the control of the ADH1 promoter. The resulting plasmid was transfected into gna1Δ cells. After the trp+ cells were selected in the presence of galactose, they were transferred to plates containing glucose and further cultured for 3 days. A series of the ScGNA1mutants harboring an alanine substitution for Ile97, Glu98, Val102, Gln107, Gly112, Leu115, Ile116, Leu119, Phe142, Tyr143, or Gly147 were generated by the oligonucleotide-directed dual amber method as described (29Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Mizuno T. Ogasahara Y. Nakagawa M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with Mutan-Express KmTM(Takara). The entire ORF of the ScGNA1 gene was cloned between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pKF18k (Takara) using EcoRI linker and hybridized with oligonucleotides containing the indicated mutations. The resulting mutant ScGNA1 genes were excised from the vector and ligated with pGEX-2T, which had been digested with BamHI andEcoRI. All the mutations were confirmed by sequencing the DNA. Previously, we demonstrated that unlike the bacterial enzyme, the eukaryotic UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase is a monofunctional protein with no phospho-GlcN acetyltransferase activity (20Mio T. Yabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14392-14397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). When searching the S. cerevisiae data base, we foundYFL017C on chromosome VI encodes a protein with homology to known acetyltransferases. To examine the physiological function ofYFL017C, we created an S. cerevisiae strain in which the endogenous YFL017C gene was disrupted, but where episomal copies of YFL017C, whose transcription was under the control of the GAL1 promoter, were maintained. The resulting strain grew on galactose plates, but died on glucose plates, confirming that YFL017C is an essential gene. When cultured on glucose plates, most of the YFL017C-deficient cells swelled and often then lysed. This morphology was quite similar to that caused by the depletion of AGM1 or UAP1 (Fig.1), suggesting that YFL017C is involved in the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc. Although the expected product of YFL017C showed only a limited sequence similarity to the C-terminal phospho-GlcN acetyltransferase domain of the bacterialGlmU gene product (15% identity, see below),YFL017C was called GNA1(glucosamine synthesisacetyltransferase 1) in this study. If GNA1 is really a gene required for an essential metabolic pathway, such as UDP-GlcNAc synthesis, it should be preserved in other organisms. A search of the C. albicans data base revealed a partial nucleotide sequence that shared sequence similarity withS. cerevisiae GNA1 (ScGNA1). By screening theC. albicans genomic DNA library with the DNA fragment of the above nucleotide sequence as a probe, we were able to clone and sequence the C. albicans homolog of GNA1(CaGNA1). The predicted products of ScGNA1 andCaGNA1 are closely related to each other (Fig.2) (44% sequence identity over the entire protein). In addition, when expressed under the control of theADH1 promoter, CaGNA1 rescued an S. cerevisiae gna1Δ null mutant (data not shown), demonstrating that the CaGNA1 functionally complements ScGNA1. Furthermore, a search of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe andCaenorhabditis elegans data bases revealed that S. pombe SPAC16E8 and C. elegans B0024-12 encode proteins which share a high degree of sequence identity with ScGna1p over the entire protein (25.2% identity between ScGna1p and the SPAC16E8 product and 28.9% identity between ScGna1p and the B0024-12 product) (Fig. 2). Therefore, we referred to these genes as S. pombe GNA1 (SpGNA1) and C. elegans GNA1(CeGNA1), respectively. Although the functionality ofSpGNA1 and CeGNA1 remains to be established, all the above results strongly support the idea that GNA1encodes ubiquitous acetyltransferase necessary for UDP-GlcNAc synthesis. In UDP-GlcNAc synthesis, there is a process involving acetyltransferase that is the acetylation of phospho-GlcN. Accordingly, we asked whetherGNA1 specifies phospho-GlcN acetyltransferase. Both ScGna1 and CaGna1 proteins were expressed in E. coli as a fusion with GST and then purified by affinity column chromatography (Fig.3 A). When incubated with GlcN-6-P and Ac-CoA, GST-ScGna1p and GST-CaGna1p produced CoA, whereas GST alone did not (Fig. 3 B). The amounts of CoA released from Ac-CoA reached a plateau within 5 min (Fig. 3 B), and GlcN-6-P was preferably utilized as the substrate (Fig. 3 C). Although small amounts of CoA were produced when higher concentrations of GlcN-1-P were present (at concentrations higher than 100 μm), the K m value for GlcN-1-P was about 25 times higher than that for GlcN-6-P (3.0 mm for GlcN-1-P versus 124 μm for GlcN-6-P) (Fig.3 C, Table I). No CoA production was observed when galactosamine 1-phosphate (GalN-1-P) was used as the substrate (Fig. 3 C).Table ICharacteristics of the mutant ScGna1pMutantK mk catk cat/K mK mfor GlcN-6-Pμmmin−1μm−1min−1μmWild type228.7812.4555.06124.13I97A229.030.964.21353.79E98A498.513.16.23161.08V102A168.7312.9179.03262.68Q107A586.823.916.74276.29G112A136.6411.9090.71108.51L115A239.261.867.76152.61I116A130.616.2247.6195.8L119AaA nonconserved Leu119 was also mutated to alanine as a control.211.9210.7550.83169.55F142A1947.941.981.06673.68Y143ANDNDNDNDG147A128.977.2458.80127.74The K m and k cat values of the wild type and mutant enzymes for Ac-CoA were determined from the amounts of CoA produced from Ac-CoA.

The K m values for GlcN-6-P are also indicated in the right column. ND, not determined. Previously, we demonstrated that together with Agm1p, Uap1p produced UDP-GlcNAc from GlcNAc-6-P (20Mio T. Yabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14392-14397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). If Gna1p really catalyzes the acetylation of GlcN-6-P and produces GlcNAc-6-P, UDP-GlcNAc would be synthesized from GlcN-6-P in the presence of Gna1p, Agm1p, and Uap1p. As expected, GST-ScGna1p and GST-CaGna1p, but not GST alone, produced [32P]UDP-GlcNAc from GlcN-6-P, when the yeast Agm1p, Uap1p, and [α-32P]UTP were added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 4). A minor spot corresponding to UDP was also observed in each lane. This is presumably due to a minor contamination of [α-32P]UDP in the [α-32P]UTP preparation, because it appeared even in the absence of the enzyme (Fig. 4). Synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc from GlcN-6-P required acetyl-CoA, GlcN-6-P, and Gna1p, confirming that Gna1p generates GlcNAc-6-P using Ac-CoA (Fig.5). Although Gna1p did not efficiently utilize GlcN-1-P as the substrate in the acetyltransferase assay (Fig.3 C), [32P]UDP-GlcNAc was efficiently synthesized from GlcN-1-P when Agm1p, Uap1p, and [32P]UTP were present (Fig. 5). Moreover, phospho-GlcNAc mutase remained an essential factor even for the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc from GlcN-1-P; no [32P]UDP-GlcNAc was detected in the absence of Agm1p (Fig. 5). This result suggests that Agm1p recognizes both phospho-GlcN and phospho-GlcNAc as the substrates; Agm1p might first convert GlcN-1-P into GlcN-6-P, providing the substrate for Gna1p, and then might attack GlcNAc-6-P which was generated from GlcN-6-P by Gna1p. Taken together, we concluded that GNA1 encodes GlcN-6-P acetyltransferase, and defined GNA1 asglucosamine-6-phosphateacetyltransferase 1.Figure 5Factors required for the production of UDP-GlcNAc from GlcN-1-P. Approximately 0.1 μg of the purified GST-ScGna1p was incubated with 0.1 μg of GST-ScUap1p and 0.1 μm [α-32P]UTP in the presence or absence of 0.1 μg of GST-ScAgm1p, 200 μm GlcN-1-P, and 200 μm Ac-CoA. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the reaction products were separated by polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC and visualized by autoradiography.

When the amino acid sequence of ScGna1p was compared with known and putative acetyltransferases, we found that although the bacterial GlmU protein is not highly related to ScGna1p, some of the amino acids in the two short regions of ScGna1p are highly conserved among several acetyltransferases (Fig. 6). These regions, designated domain I and domain II, encompass the amino acid positions from 97 to 117 and from 142 to 147, respectively. To examine the importance of these domains for catalysis, we mutated the highly conserved amino acids in these regions Ile97, Glu98, Val102, Gly112, Leu115, Ile116, Phe142, Tyr143, and Gly147 to alanine. As a control, a nonconserved Leu119 was also converted to alanine. After confirming the nucleotide sequences, all the mutant enzymes were expressed as a fusion with GST and purified by affinity column chromatography (Fig. 7 A). As shown in Fig. 7 B, alanine substitutions for Val102, Gly112, Leu115, Ile116, Leu119, and Gly147 only weakly impaired the activity. In contrast, those for Phe142and Tyr143 severely diminished the activity. Furthermore, although the activity of Y143A was too low to perform kinetics, alanine substitution for the neighboring amino acid Phe142increased the K m values for Ac-CoA and GlcN-6-P by about 10- and 5-fold, respectively (Table I). The activities of I97A and E98A were also affected to a lesser extent (Fig.7 B). Interestingly, these two mutants displayed different features of the binding affinities to the cofactor and the substrate. Mutation of Ile97 increased the K m value for GlcN-6-P by about 3-fold, whereas that of Glu98 raised the K m value for Ac-CoA by about 2.5-fold (TableI).Figure 7Effects on ScGna1p activity of alanine substitution for the conserved amino acids. The wild type and the mutant ScGna1 proteins bearing an alanine substitution for each of the amino acids that are highly conserved in several acetyltransferases listed in Fig. 6 were expressed as a fusion with GST and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads. A, approximately 1-μg amounts of the wild type (WT) and the indicated mutant proteins were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The positions of the protein size markers and GST-ScUap1p are indicated in kilodaltons and by thearrowhead, respectively. B, approximately 0.1 μg of the purified wild type (WT) and the indicated mutant proteins were incubated with 200 μm each of GlcN-6-P and Ac-CoA at 30 °C for 10 min, and the amounts of the released CoA that represent the enzyme activities were determined as described in Fig. 3. The activities of the mutant enzymes are indicated as a percent of that of the wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In human spermine/spermidineN 1-acetyltransferase (HsSSAT), it was demonstrated that the amino acid sequence motif RGFGIGS beginning at the position of 101 is required for the Ac-CoA binding and that Arg101 and the proximal glycine loops in this motif are essential for the enzyme activity (30Lu L. Berkey K.A. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18920-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, the double mutant R101A/E152K acts as a dominant negative (31Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In our sequence alignment, Arg101 and Gly106 of HsSSAT correspond to Gln107 and Gly112 of ScGna1p, respectively (Fig. 6). As indicated above, G112A restored the significant activity, and other amino acids in the RGFGIGS motif are not highly conserved in Gna1p-related acetyltransferases listed in Table I and Fig. 6. Accordingly, we mutated Gln107 of ScGna1p to alanine. Though the effect of the mutation of Gln107 was not as severe as those of Phe142 and Tyr143, the activity and the kcat values of Q107A were significantly lower than that of the wild type, and theK m value for Ac-CoA was about five times higher than that of the wild type enzyme (Fig. 7 B, Table I). From these results, it was speculated that Phe142 and Tyr143 of ScGna1p are essential residues for the catalysis, and that Ile97, Glu98, and Gln107also locate in the active pocket and support the binding of the cofactor and the substrate. In this paper, we have identified the yeast GNA1 as the gene for phospho-GlcN acetyltransferase, and demonstrated that unlike the case in bacteria, yeast UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase and phospho-GlcN acetyltransferase are encoded by distinct genes. BecauseUAP1, AGM1, GNA1, and GFA1are all essential genes (18Watzele G. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8753-8758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hofmann M. Boles E. Zimmermann F.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14392-14397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), every step of the UDP-GlcNAc synthesis is essential for the viability of yeast cells. In addition, yeast has only one type of acetylated amino sugar, that is GlcNAc; neither GalNAc nor N-acetylmannosamine is present in yeast cells. Thus, Gna1p is expected to be the sole amino sugar acetyltransferase present in yeast cells. ScGna1p showed a relatively higher K m value for Ac-CoA (228 μm) compared with those of other acetyltransferases (e.g. 3 μm for HsSSAT and 3.8 μm for choline acetyltransferase) (30Lu L. Berkey K.A. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18920-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochem.

This is also true for the E. coli phospho-GlcN acetyltransferase (320 μm) (26Gehring A.M. Lees W.J. Mindiola D.J. Walsh C.T. Brown E.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Probably, low affinity to Ac-CoA is unique feature of phospho-GlcN acetyltransferases. The K mvalue of ScGna1p for GlcN-6-P was also comparatively high (124 μm). The enzyme displayed a reasonable substrate specificity to GlcN-6-P, however, because the K mvalue for GlcN-1-P was about 25 times greater than that for GlcN-6-P. Nevertheless, ScGna1p produced UDP-GlcNAc from GlcN-1-P in the presence of Agm1p, Uap1p, and UTP. Because Uap1p does not utilize GlcNAc-6-P as the substrate (20Mio T. Yabe T. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14392-14397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the results obtained in this study indicate that Agm1p has a broad substrate specificity and recognizes phospho-GlcN as well. In fact, not only phospho-GlcNAc but also phosphoglucose can be the substrate of Agm1p (19Hofmann M. Boles E. Zimmermann F.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although PAT1, which denotes putativeacetyltransferase, is not listed in the yeast data base, a search of the literature revealed that the amino acid sequence of ScGna1p is identical to that of previously reported Pat1p (33Lin R. Allis C.D. Elledge S.J. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 923-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PAT1 was isolated as the gene that suppressed the histone H1-dependent growth of the S. cerevisiaeYRL4 cells (33Lin R. Allis C.D. Elledge S.J. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 923-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Depletion of Pat1p function results in multiple phenotypical changes. The PAT1-deficient cells displayed enlarged cell volume, increased sensitivity to the microtuble inhibitor, benomyl, aberrant spindle structure, and incompletion of cytokinesis. Furthermore, by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, it was demonstrated that PAT1 is required for multiple steps in the cell cycle, such as exit from G0, progression of DNA synthesis, and mitosis (33Lin R. Allis C.D. Elledge S.J. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 923-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All these facts suggest a physiological link between UDP-GlcNAc synthesis and cell cycle progression. As UDP-GlcNAc is mainly used as the cell wall precursor in yeast, we wonder whether Gna1p has additional substrates, such as core histones, whose acetylation is essential for gene expression and cell cycle progression; however, no histone acetyltransferase activity was detected in the recombinant ScGna1p. Lin et al. (33Lin R. Allis C.D. Elledge S.J. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 923-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) cloned the PAT1/GNA1 homolog fromS. pombe by the functional complementation of an S. cerevisiae pat1Δ null mutation. Although the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal region of S. pombe Pat1p (SpPat1p) is identical to that of SpGna1p, the previously identified SpPat1p has 245 additional amino acids at the N terminus (33Lin R. Allis C.D. Elledge S.J. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 923-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because we could not find the DNA sequence corresponding to SpPat1p in the S. pombe data base, the presence of the extra N-terminal amino acids in SpPat1p may be unique to a certain S. pombe strain. Sequence comparisons of the various acetyltransferases revealed that ScGna1p contains two short domains, where several amino acids are highly conserved among several known and putative acetyltransferases. By the mutation study, we found that Phe142 and Tyr143 of ScGna1p are crucial amino acids for the catalytic reaction and that Ile97, Glu98, and Gln107 also play important roles in the binding of the cofactor and the substrate. As mentioned before, arginine at the position of 101 and the proximal glycine loops of HsSSAT have been implicated to be the active site of the enzyme (30Lu L. Berkey K.A. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18920-18924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Coleman C.S. Huang H. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although Arg101 of HsSSAT is converted to glutamine in the yeast Gna1 proteins, our results indicate that Gln107 of ScGna1p is also involved in the Ac-CoA binding. In contrast, alanine substitution for the highly conserved Gly112, which corresponds to the third glycine in the RGFGIGS motif, had little effect on the activity of ScGna1p, and other glycines in the RGFGIGS motif are not highly conserved in ScGna1p and its homologs. Recently, the three-dimensional structures of the yeast histone acetyltransferase (Hat1p) and Serratia marcescens aminoglycoside 3-N-acetyltransferase, both of which belong to the GCN5-related superfamily, were solved, and the R/Q-X-X-G-X-G motif, whereX denotes some variations, was demonstrated to form an important part of the pyrophosphate-binding loop (34Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 35Wolf E. Vassilev A. Makino Y. Sali A. Nakatani Y. Burley S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our results suggest that Phe142 and Tyr143 in domain II of Gna1p play more important roles in the Ac-CoA binding. Because neither Phe142 nor Tyr143 is conserved in most of GCN5-relatedN-acetyltransferases, it is still difficult to predict the exact roles of these two amino acids in catalysis. Possibly, Phe142 and Tyr143 in domain II are involved in the interaction with the adenine base of Ac-CoA. We thank S. Fukuchi for data base search and sequence alignment, Y. Miyazaki for assisting with the experiments, and S. B. Miwa for reading the manuscript."

Interaction of CD40L (CD154) with its receptor, CD40, provides essential signals for the development of a protective humoral immune response and is a key mechanism in the regulation of defense against pathogenic assault (for review see Ref. 1Grewal I.S. Flavell R.A. Immunol. Res. 1997; 16: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). CD40, a 50-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1 receptor superfamily (for review see Refs. 2Armitage R.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar and 3Gruss H.J. Dower S.K.

CD40 is also expressed on a number of other cell types including endothelial cells and a significant proportion of carcinomas. CD40L is predominantly expressed on activated CD4+ T cells, but variable expression has also been reported on CD8+ T cells, mast cells, basophils, B cells, monocytes, NK cells, and activated platelets (1Grewal I.S.

Nature. 1998; 391: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Generally, CD40L does not exist naturally in a soluble form, although exceptions have been reported (5Armitage R.J. Sato T.A.

Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1749-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Initial studies focusing on the interaction of CD40L with its receptor on B cells show that CD40L is largely responsible for the helper T cell function that drives B cell proliferation and Ig class switching and protects B cells from apoptotic cell death. More recent studies on other cell types have indicated an important role for CD40L in the induction of T cell-mediated effector functions, antigen presentation, and costimulatory activity of antigen-presenting cells and in the production of many cytokines (for review see Ref. 1Grewal I.S. Flavell R.A. Immunol. Res. 1997; 16: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). CD40L is a type II membrane glycoprotein and is a member of the TNF superfamily. CD40L has an extracellular domain consisting of a 75-amino acid spacer region immediately adjacent to the membrane spanning region that is not shared by other family members and a receptor-binding domain that consists of two stacked β-sheets. The receptor-binding domain has low amino acid sequence homology with TNF family members (<30%) but has high structural homology (7Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel C.V. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Soluble forms of CD40L have been expressed that are able to induce B cell proliferation, costimulate Ig class switching, and suppress the induction of apoptosis (8Fanslow W.C. Srinivasan S. Paxton R. Gibson M.G. Spriggs M.K. Armitage R.J. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 9Hollenbaugh D. Grosmaire L.S. Kullas C.D. Chalupny N.J. Braesch-Andersen S.

As with cell surface expressed CD40L, maximal activity of soluble forms of the molecule is dependent on the presence of costimulatory cytokines. Interestingly, in contrast to its generally stimulatory effects on normal B cells, interaction of soluble recombinant CD40L with CD40 on neoplastic B cells can lead to growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo effects appear to be mediated via both direct and indirect mechanisms. These findings suggest that soluble CD40L may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of some B cell lymphomas (3Gruss H.J. Dower S.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 3378-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,11Funakoshi S. Longo D.L. Beckwith M. Conley D.K. Tsarfaty G. Tsarfaty I. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Spriggs M.K. Murphy W.J.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 2488-2496PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies with CD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), both whole antibody and F(ab)′2 fragments, and various forms of soluble CD40L have demonstrated that each reagent has a unique ability to signal through the receptor. In general, the more multimeric the signaling agent, the more sustained is the subsequent signaling. Thus, bivalent mAb and dimeric or trimeric soluble forms of CD40L have more potent biological activity than either F(ab)′2 antibody fragments or soluble CD40L lacking multimerization domains (8Fanslow W.C. Srinivasan S. Paxton R. Gibson M.G. Spriggs M.K. Armitage R.J. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, although monovalent F(ab) fragments of CD40 mAbs can bind to CD40, they are not stimulatory and in fact antagonize signaling mediated via soluble trimeric CD40L (8Fanslow W.C. Srinivasan S. Paxton R. Gibson M.G. Spriggs M.K. Armitage R.J. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These data indicate not only that CD40 cross-linking is necessary for signaling but also that the degree of cross-linking determines the magnitude of the response. Recent investigations have shown that soluble forms of recombinant CD40L consisting only of the TNF homologous region spontaneously associate as trimers (13Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D. Structure. 1995; 3: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It has not been clear, therefore, why the addition of a multimerization domain would increase the activity of soluble CD40L. In the current report we have explored further the role of the trimerization domain in enhancing the activity of soluble human CD40L. We have expressed soluble forms of both the TNF homologous region and the entire extracellular domain of human CD40L and compared the activity of these molecules with that of a hybrid molecule consisting of the CD40L TNF homologous region fused to an isoleucine zipper (IZ) trimerization domain at its N terminus. We have found that the soluble CD40L molecules containing either the spacer region or the trimerization domain have significantly higher biological activity than constructs containing just the TNF homologous region. Furthermore, the CD40L construct consisting of only the TNF homologous region is considerably less stable than the form containing the trimerization domain. Taken together, the findings presented here suggest that the superior biological activity seen with the IZ-containing form of soluble CD40L is likely to be due to the ability of this trimerization motif to stabilize soluble CD40L into an orientation that is more favorable for receptor signaling. The TNF homologous region of human CD40L (amino acids 113–261) (14Spriggs M.K. Armitage R.J. Strockbine L. Clifford K.N. Macduff B.M. Sato T.A. Maliszewski C.R. Fanslow W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified, cloned 3′ to the human growth hormone leader sequence (15Pecceu F. Dousset P. Shire D. Cavrois E. Marchese E. Ferrara P. Kaghad M. Dumont X. Lupker J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 97: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in Bluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequence verified. The final protein sequence included a Thr-Ser dipeptide that is retained in the N terminus after processing of the growth hormone leader. The CD40L molecule encoded by this plasmid is termed CD40L receptor-binding domain (RBD). Similarly the entire extracellular region of CD40L (amino acids 52–261) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and cloned 3′ to the human growth hormone leader sequence, and this CD40L molecule was designated CD40L FL (full length). CD40L FL also contained a Thr-Ser at the N terminus after processing of the growth hormone leader sequence. Soluble human CD40L was also expressed as a hybrid protein containing a trimerization domain fused to the N terminus of the TNF homologous region (amino acids 112–261). The trimerization domain is based upon a leucine zipper motif (16O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) modified to form a trimer (17Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). This soluble CD40L molecule, designated CD40L IZ, includes a Thr-Ser-Ser-Asp sequence at its N terminus and Leu-Leu at the junction between the IZ and RBD regions of the molecule. For expression in CHO cells, the various CD40L constructs were cloned into the expression vector 2a5I (18Morris A.E. Lee C.C. Hodges K. Aldrich T.L. Krantz C. Smidt P.S. Thomas J.N. Carrondo M.J.T. Griffiths B. Moreira J.L.P. Animal Cell Technology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1997: 529-534Crossref Google Scholar). The final CD40L constructs were transfected into DXB11 DHFR− CHO cells (19Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4216-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINETM(Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, the cells were subcultivated into DHFR selection medium lacking glycine, hypoxanthine, and thymidine (−GHT) and grown to confluence. The cells were then selected in −GHT medium containing 50 μm methotrexate. Cell clones from each transfection were pooled and used in production cultures to generate milligram quantities of each soluble CD40L molecule. One molar Tris, pH 8.5, was added to the harvested cell culture supernatant to a final molarity of 80 mm and adjusted to pH 8.5 with 2 n NaOH. The adjusted cell culture supernatant was then diluted 1:5 with water before loading onto a Macro-Prep High Q column (4.4cmd × 4.2cmh) at a flow rate of 70 ml/min that was previously equilibrated in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5. The resulting unbound fraction was then directly loaded at a flow rate of 70 ml/min onto a Fractogel SO3− 650 m column (4.4-cm diameter × 1.8-cm height) that was previously equilibrated in 25 mm Tris, pH 8. The column was then washed in sequence with equilibration buffer followed by 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5. The recombinant CD40L was then eluted from the column with 0.3 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5. The eluted CD40L was then dialyzed into 25 mm Tris, 4% mannitol, 1% sucrose, pH 7.4 buffer and subsequently 0.2μ filtered. The final concentration of CD40L in the purified preparations was determined by amino acid analysis (20Spackman D.H. Stein W.H. Moore S. Anal. Chem. 1958; 30: 1185-1190Crossref Scopus (6603) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–20% Tris-Glycine gels, Novex, San Diego, CA). After electrophoresis, the gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or blotted onto nitrocellulose paper (Novex, San Diego, CA.) for Western blotting to visualize the protein bands. Western blots were performed using the mouse anti-human CD40L mAb M90 (21Fanslow W.C. Rousseau A.-M. Lofton T.E. Klinke R. Ulrich D.T. Armitage R.J. Kishimoto T.E.A. Leucocyte Typing VI. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1997: 101Google Scholar), which was generated at Immunex using recombinant human CD40L as immunogen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary reagent, and Western blots were developed using a chemiluminecent reagent (LumiGlo, Kirkegaard, and Perry Labs, Gaithersburg, MA). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized blood of healthy donors by centrifugation over Isolymph (Gallard-Schlesinger Industries Inc., Carle Place, NY). Purification of B cells was achieved by removal of cells rosetting with 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide-treated sheep red blood cells followed by positive enrichment by magnetic cell separation technology (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) using CD19-coated magnetic beads. The resultant B cell population was >98% CD20+ with no detectable CD3+ T cells as determined by flow cytometric analysis on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). B cell proliferation assays were conducted in RPMI medium + 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. 50,000 cells/well were cultured in triplicate in round-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates (Corning, Corning, NY) for 90 h in the presence of the appropriate additives as described under “Results.” Cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well tritiated thymidine (25 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the final 18 h of culture. Cells were harvested, and the number of cpm incorporated was determined by tritium-sensitive avalanche gas ionization detection on a Matrix 96 Direct Beta Counter (Packard, Meriden, CT). For IgE secretion, cells (5 × 104/well) were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium + 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma), 5 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. Quantitation of IgE levels in supernatants after 10 days of culture was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (22Armitage R.J. Macduff B.M. Eisenman J. Paxton R. Grabstein K.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 483-490PubMed Google Scholar). The nonglycosylated polypeptide molecular masses of the CD40L IZ and CD40L RBD constructs were determined using the SEC-UV/LS/RI method (on-line SEC followed by detection using ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm, light scattering at 90 °, and refractive index detectors in series). Light scattering and refractive index measurements were collected using a DAWN DSP and Optilab differential refractometer (products of Wyatt Technology Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA). The experiments were carried out using an Integral high pressure liquid chromatography system (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Farmingham, MA) with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Column loads for the two cases studied ranged from 150 to 200 μg. The flow rate was 1 ml/min with a mobile phase of 200 mm sodium phosphate at pH 8. All detector systems were calibrated as described (23Arakawa T. Langley K.E. Kameyama K. Takagi T. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Wen J. Arakawa T.

The resulting plot of (LS × UV)/[ε × (RI)2] as a function of molecular mass was linear, passing through the origin and having anr 2 = 0.994. LS is the light scattering intensity, RI is the refractive index, andUV is the absorbance. The slope of this plot provided the combined instrumental calibration constant k“ used in the determination of the molecular mass of the CD40L IZ and CD40L RBD. Theoretical molar extinction coefficients (ε) were determined from the amino acid composition (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) for the CD40L RBD and CD40L IZ versions of soluble CD40L and were found to be 0.76 and 0.65, respectively. Data were acquired using ASTRA (accompanying software from Wyatt Technology Corporation). Calorimetric measurements were carried out using a MicroCal MC-2 DSC. Samples were buffer exchanged into 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 400 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. Protein concentrations under these conditions were nominally between 2 and 3 mg/ml. The scan rate in each case tested was 68 °C/h. The thermograms were background corrected and rescans were employed to evaluate the reversibility of the unfolding transitions. In all cases examined the second upscan yielded no reversible enthalpy, suggesting that the sample was irreversibly denatured as indicated by the presence of aggregate when withdrawing the sample from the DSC. In this study, 90 °C was set as the upper temperature limit, which was beyond the completion of the major melting transition of the soluble CD40L molecules. All data manipulation was performed using the Origin software provided with the instrument. The three CD40L molecules compared in this study are diagrammed in Fig.1 A. After purification as described under “Materials and Methods,” each soluble CD40L preparation was analyzed for purity using Western blots (Fig.1 B, lanes 1–3) and Coomassie gels (Fig.1 B, lanes 4–6). Each molecule had one main band that migrated slightly higher than the predicted molecular mass and at least one faint lower molecular mass band that migrated closer to the expected monomeric molecular mass. The calculated peptide molecular masses for CD40L FL, CD40L RBD, and CD40L IZ are 24.0, 16.4, and 20.9 kDa, respectively. The preparations of CD40L IZ and CD40L RBD showed no bands on Coomassie gels besides the CD40L bands. The Coomassie preparation of CD40L FL (Fig. 1 B, lane 4) had a large number of background bands that were not detected by Western blot. This molecule did not express as well as the other two, and thus it was more difficult to obtain a highly purified final preparation. Previous analysis using N-glycanase of CD40L molecules expressed in CHO cells have indicated that the higher molecular mass bands detected on the Western blot are glycoforms of CD40L. The biological activities of CD40L RBD and CD40L IZ were compared in a human B cell proliferation assay performed in the presence of IL-4 as a costimulus (Fig.2 A). Although both forms of CD40L induce B cell proliferation, the IZ construct showed significantly higher biological activity with effects seen at ligand concentrations as low as 20 ng/ml. Proliferation induced by these forms of soluble CD40L could be inhibited by addition of anti-CD40L antibodies to the cultures (data not shown). A similar distinction in the activities of the two CD40L constructs was seen in the induction of IgE secretion from IL-4-costimulated B cells (Fig. 2 B). The CD40L RBD and CD40L FL were compared also for their ability to induce proliferation of peripheral blood B cells (Fig.3). An effect of the CD40L RBD was seen at concentrations higher than 1 μg/ml, whereas the full-length form of the ligand had greater biological activity, measurable down to 300 ng/ml. One possible explanation for the increased activity of CD40L IZ compared with that of the CD40L RBD construct could be attributed to it existing in a higher order multimeric form in solution. To evaluate the multimeric state of these two recombinant CD40L variants, SEC followed by three-detector analysis was employed. Evaluation of the molecular mass of glycosylated proteins using the SEC-UV/LS/RI method offers the advantage of being able to assess the molecular mass of the molecule as if it were nonglycosylated; glycosylation is essentially transparent at 280 nm (23Arakawa T. Langley K.E. Kameyama K. Takagi T. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A shows the elution profile of the CD40L RBD with a peak elution volume of 13.6 ml. The SEC-UV/LS/RI method yielded a measured molecular mass of 49.47 ± 0.81 kDa. Utilizing the monomer polypeptide molecular mass of this molecule (16.4 kDa), it was determined that CD40L RBD is indeed a trimer. This confirms and extends the findings from sucrose gradient sedimentation experiments published earlier (10Mazzei G.J. Edgerton M.D. Losberger C. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Graber P. Durandy A. Gauchat J.-F. Bernard A. Allet B. Bonnefoy J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7025-7028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Similarly, the polypeptide molecular mass of the CD40L IZ as measured by SEC-UV/LS/RI was 62.2 ± 0.14 kDa (Fig. 4 B). This is approximately three times the monomer molecular mass (20.9 kDa). These results provide evidence that both soluble forms of CD40L are trimeric. An alternative explanation for the increased activity of CD40L IZ compared with CD40L RBD is that the latter may disassociate into monomers at lower concentrations. Disassociation of trimeric CD40L RBD at low concentrations could greatly impair its ability to cross-link and thus signal through CD40. To address this issue, CD40L RBD was diluted to 2 μg/ml, and disassociation was monitored using the SEC-UV method. No disassociation of the CD40L RBD was detected (Fig.5), suggesting that this was not the reason for the differences observed in the biological activity of the CD40L IZ and CD40L RBD constructs. At 2 μg/ml the CD40L IZ molecule showed greater activity than CD40L RBD (Fig. 2 A); thus, disassociation of CD40L RBD into monomers does not explain the differences in activity. It is possible that the distinct activities of the CD40L IZ and CD40L RBD could be due to a difference in stability. To address this issue, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed. The DSC data distinctly showed a 10 °C difference in the melting transition, with the CD40L RBD having the lower melting transition (Fig. 6). Collectively, these data suggest that in the CD40L IZ, the IZ confers appreciable conformational stability compared with that seen in CD40L RBD, despite both existing in solution as trimers. That is to say, it is more difficult thermodynamically for the IZ version of the molecule to unfold under the given solution conditions. This might be explained in terms of the local restraint offered by the IZ in proximity to the receptor-binding domain. The results presented here demonstrate that the three forms of soluble CD40L examined, CD40L RBD, CD40L FL, and CD40L IZ, are biologically active. The presence of the IZ trimerization domain or the native extracellular spacer region significantly increased the activity of soluble CD40L in B cell proliferation assays. The presence of the IZ trimerization domain on CD40L RBD also increased IgE secretion. Significantly enhanced activity of CD40L IZ constructs, compared with that of CD40L RBD, was seen also in the induction of B cell activation antigens, CD54, CD86, and HLA-DR (data not shown). Furthermore, the SEC-UV/LS/RI method demonstrated that CD40L RBD and CD40L IZ exist as trimers in solution. Finally, the DSC study indicated that addition of the IZ serves to conformationally stabilize CD40L RBD. Molecular modeling studies have shown (7Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel C.V. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and crystallographic studies at 2 Å resolution have confirmed (13Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D. Structure. 1995; 3: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) that the trimerization of CD40L RBD involves Tyr170 and His224 to form an unusual cluster of two triads along the 3-fold axis. The trimerized assemblages are stabilized by hydrogen bonds and presumably salt bridge interactions. The DSC data indicate that significant differences exist in overall conformational stability when the IZ motif is incorporated at the N terminus of the RBD. Without the IZ, the CD40L RBD molecule would be more prone to unfold at the N terminus rather than the C terminus, because the latter is buried in the interior of the trimerized molecule (13Karpusas M. Hsu Y.M. Wang J.H. Thompson J. Lederman S. Chess L. Thomas D. Structure. 1995; 3: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). With the IZ one can begin to imagine how the N terminus would be constrained, making it more difficult to unfold from that end. The broad features in the unfolding profile of the IZ may suggest an unraveling of the molecule that begins with an overall loosening of the protein interior and ends with the sheet regions of the molecule exposed. The trimerized assemblages may thus form aggregates in the unfolded state (observations after removal of samples from the DSC have shown visible signs of aggregation). Such structural restraint of the N terminus may also affect the way in which the ligand interacts with the receptor and explain the enhanced bioactivity. Site-directed mutagenesis has shown that Lys143 and Tyr145 are critical for CD40L interaction with CD40 (27Bajorath J. Chalupny N.J. Marken J.S. Siadak A.W. Skonier J. Gordon M. Hollenbaugh D. Noelle R.J. Ochs H.D. Aruffo A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1833-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These residues are in close proximity to the N terminus. Restraint at the N terminus conferred by the IZ may stabilize the configuration in this region and thus augment signaling. In addition to improved conformational stability, the IZ may enhance signaling through other mechanisms. Based on previous studies using mAbs to mediate receptor ligation, it is predicted that binding of soluble CD40L to CD40 is followed by rapid cell surface localization and internalization of the receptor-ligand complex. The presence of the IZ motif in the CD40L IZ molecule may result in binding to CD40 in such a way that these processes are retarded, resulting in prolonged signaling through CD40. It is not clear why we were able to detect activity for the CD40L FL and others were not (10Mazzei G.J. Edgerton M.D. Losberger C. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Graber P. Durandy A. Gauchat J.-F. Bernard A. Allet B. Bonnefoy J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7025-7028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It could be that in the bacterial system it was not possible to achieve the correct folding or that important differences exist in the glycosylation achieved in bacteria compared with CHO cells. Either could affect the biological activity of CD40L FL. Furthermore, our studies with CHO cell-derived CD40L FL indicate that this molecule has a tendency to aggregate, which could explain why it has relatively good biological activity compared with CD40L RBD, because in a partially aggregated form it could more effectively mediate receptor cross-linking. Modeling studies have pointed to structural similarities between CD40L and TNF, a prototype member of the TNF/nerve growth factor superfamily of ligands. However, it is important to note that although biologically active TNF exists naturally as a soluble homotrimer, CD40L is predominantly expressed as a membrane-anchored molecule. Results presented in this study and those of Mazzei and colleagues (10Mazzei G.J. Edgerton M.D. Losberger C. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Graber P. Durandy A. Gauchat J.-F. Bernard A. Allet B. Bonnefoy J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7025-7028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain of CD40L can associate to form homotrimers in solution. However, in contrast to TNF, such a configuration does not impart optimal biological activity to the soluble CD40L molecule, because its stability appears to be enhanced considerably by the presence of the 75-amino acid spacer region or the IZ trimerization domain. This suggests that this region between the RBD and the transmembrane domain of the CD40L molecule may be important in facilitating formation of stable CD40L complexes on the cell surface. Supporting evidence for the importance of N-terminal multimerization in the structural integrity of CD40L comes from studies on a hyper IgM patient whose CD40L gene contained a deletion of the coding region for the extracellular spacer domain (28Seyama K. Nonoyama S. Gangaas I. Hollenbaugh D. Pabst H.F. Alejandro A. Ochs H.D. Blood. 1998; 92: 2421-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study the mutant CD40L was expressed in COS cells and found to have a reduced ability to bind to CD40 compared with a wild type CD40L. Regardless of the mechanism responsible for the enhanced biological activity observed, the results presented here shed new light on signaling mediated by soluble forms of CD40L. In two examples, the CD40L IZ and the CD40L FL, the presence of an N-terminal multimerization domain resulted in soluble forms of the ligand with improved specific activities. This result is not predicted by protein modeling studies, which suggest that the critical region for functional association of the CD40L molecule is just contained within the TNF homologous region. In fact, within the TNF ligand superfamily enhanced biological activity of IZ-containing constructs is not confined to CD40L. The activities of soluble Fas ligand and TRAIL, the extracellular domains of which can occur naturally in soluble form, are significantly enhanced by the addition of the IZ motif at the N terminus. 2D.

Further investigations into the mechanism of action of the IZ motif should lead to greater insight into regulation of receptor signaling and development of therapeutic constructs for this important family of molecules.

https://openalex.org/W3101535983,"The BN/KL region in the Orion molecular cloud1 is an archetype for the study of the formation of stars much more massive than the Sun2. This region contains luminous young stars and protostars but, like most star-forming regions, is difficult to study in detail because of the obscuring effects of dust and gas. Our basic expectations are shaped to some extent by the present theoretical picture of star formation, the cornerstone of which is that protostars accrete gas from rotating equatorial disks and shed angular momentum by ejecting gas in bipolar outflows. The main source of the outflow in the BN/KL region3,4,5 may be an object known as radio source I (ref. 6), which is commonly believed to be surrounded by a rotating disk of molecular material7,8,9. Here we report high-resolution observations of silicon monoxide (SiO) and water maser emission from the gas surrounding source I. We show that within 60 AUof the source (about the size of the Solar System), the region is dominated by a conical bipolar outflow, rather than the expected disk. A slower outflow, close to the equatorial plane of the protostellar system, extends to radii of 1,000 AU."

Superoxide dismutases (SODs)1 are found in all aerobic organisms and are thought to participate in the detoxification of reactive oxygen intermediates by catalyzing superoxide anion (O·̄2) dismutation, yielding hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and molecular oxygen (O2) (1Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). Three distinct SODs have been described in mammalian cells: a mitochondrial manganese-associated SOD, whose function is likely to detoxify superoxide anion generated by partial O2 reduction during oxidative phosphorylation; an extracellular SOD, which is found in extracellular fluids and bound to the extracellular matrix; and a cytosolic Cu,Zn-SOD, whose endogenous role remains poorly understood (2Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 3Przedborski S. Schon E.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 99-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The fundamental importance of SOD activity is illustrated in various organisms by the phenotype of mutants that do not express a form of SOD. In bacteria and yeast, SOD deficiency leads to severe growth deficits under aerobic conditions (4Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 5Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski A. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The life span ofDrosophila that lack SOD is shortened. Conversely,Drosophila that overexpress SOD and catalase can live up to 150% longer (6Phillips J.P. Campbell S.D. Michaud D. Charbonneau M. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1973; 137: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This region is involved in the most common genetic disease, known as trisomy 21 or Down's syndrome. However, although a 1.5-fold increase inSOD1 gene expression may be associated with the disease, several Down's syndrome patients carrying a partial trisomy 21 have a normal Cu,Zn-SOD activity (11De La Torre L.T. Casado A. Lopez-Fernandez E. Carrascosa D. Ramirez V. Saez J. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 871-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has been reported that some cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a serious neurodegenerative disease, are associated with dominant mutations in the SOD1gene (12Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P. Deng H.X. Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5443) Google Scholar, 13Deng H.X. Hentati A. Tainer J.A.

However, a gain of function is likely to cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, rather than a defect of Cu,Zn-SOD activity (14Yim M.B. Kang J.H. Yim H.S. Kwak H.S. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in mice, Cu,Zn-SOD homozygous null mutants are viable and do not exhibit the neuropathological symptoms characteristic of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. However, these Cu,Zn-SOD−/− mice exhibit an enhanced neuronal cell death following axotomy or ischemia, suggesting a requirement for Cu,Zn-SOD under stress (15Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown R.H.J. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 16Kondo T.

Chait A. Wolfbauer G. Deeb S.S. Blood. 1989; 74: 1807-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Allen R.G. Keogh B.P. Gerhard G.S. Pignolo R. Horton J. Cristofalo V.J. J. Cell.

Med. 1997; 23: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the SOD1 gene is often considered as a “housekeeping gene,” and its activity is often used as an internal control when variations of manganese-associated SOD activity are measured. We report here the analysis of the proximal region of theSOD1 gene promoter. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was used as a model agonist to identify trans- and cis-acting factors for SOD1 gene expression. We found that SOD1 gene expression is rapidly enhanced following PMA treatment. A region between nucleotides −71 and −29 was essential for both basal and PMA-induced expression. This region could be further refined to a single Sp1/Egr-1/WT1-binding site located between nucleotides −59 and −48. These findings suggest that competition between Sp1, Egr-1, and variants of WT1 (and perhaps other Sp1- or Egr-related proteins) for the same binding site may play a role in the regulation of SOD1 gene expression in response to a variety of biological signals.DISCUSSIONWe report the analysis of the human Cu,Zn-SOD gene proximal promoter. Deletion analysis of the SOD1 gene promoter suggests the existence of several regulatory sequences spread along the 5′-flanking region of the SOD1 gene. Indeed, previous reports had allowed identification of several cis-acting sequences. Two AP-2 sites located between positions −134 and −127 and positions −118 and −111 are involved in the promoter response toPanax ginseng extracts (30Kim Y.H. Park K.H. Rho H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24539-24543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An Sp1 site (positions −104 to −89) and a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) site (positions −64 to −55) have also been described (31Seo S.J. Kim H.T. Cho G. Rho H.M. Jung G. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 178: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that, although several regulatory sequences are present within 1.5 kilobases of 5′-upstream sequences, the SOD1 promoter region located between nucleotides −71 and +1 is sufficient to provide both basal and PMA-induced promoter activities. Within this region, we identified a site located between nucleotides −59 and −48 that is able to bind Sp1 constitutively and Egr-1 following PMA treatment. This sequence can also mediate transactivation by two splicing variants of the Wilms' tumor protein WT1. Interestingly, the C/EBP-binding site (positions −64 to −55) described by Seo et al. (31Seo S.J. Kim H.T. Cho G. Rho H.M. Jung G. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 178: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) partially overlaps the Sp1/Egr-1 site (positions –59 to −48) described in this study, suggesting the existence of a complex interplay between different trans-acting factors for the transcriptional regulation of the SOD1 gene.Comparison of the Sp1/Egr-1 site with consensus Sp1-, Egr-1-, or WT1-binding sites (Fig. 7) revealed that this site does not fit consensus sequences described so far (32Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). In addition, in most other sequences recognized by both Sp1 and Egr-1, the binding sites of the two proteins overlap on six nucleotides, but are not identical (27Liu C. Calogero A. Ragona G. Adamson E. Mercola D. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 101-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, Sp1 and Egr-1 sites seem to be identical or at least do not seem to differ by more than two nucleotides since we could not find a mutation that affects binding of only one of the two factors. This non-canonical Sp1/Egr-1/WT1 binding sequence might represent the prototype of a novel binding site involved in transcriptional regulation by members of the zinc finger transcription factor family. Another sequence is recognized by a possible Sp1-like protein. Surprisingly, the Sp1-like site fits perfectly the Sp1 consensus sequence, but does not seem to be involved in SOD1 transcription regulation in HeLa cells since a mutation at this site does not lead to significant modification of transcriptional activity.The apparent lack of phenotype in SOD1 null mice (15Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown R.H.J. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) indicates that Cu,Zn-SOD is probably not necessary for normal development and life, but rather is involved in the response to stress. Indeed, the only phenotype described for these mice is a partial defect in motor neuron regeneration following section. Interestingly, Egr-1 has been described as a key factor in response to mechanical stress in endothelial cells (33Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Thus, Egr-1 regulation of the SOD1gene provides a link between this key factor and Cu,Zn-SOD in response to mechanical stress in endothelial cells. Accordingly, a recent report has described an induction of Cu,Zn-SOD activity in human aortic endothelial cells in response to shear stress (34Inoue N. Ramasamy S. Fukai T. Nerem R.M. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This increase in activity was, at least in part, mediated by increased transcription of the SOD1 gene and was not observed in aortic smooth muscle cells. Although it was not demonstrated that this increase was mediated by Egr-1, we propose that Egr-1 regulation of SOD1participates, via the antioxidant properties of Cu,Zn-SOD, in an atheroprotective pathway.The function of the tumor suppressor protein WT1 in SOD1gene regulation remains unknown. A connection between WT1 and apoptotic processes has been described in several reports. WT1 stabilizes p53 and inhibits its ability to induce apoptosis in response to various stimuli (35Maheswaran S. Englert C. Bennett P. Heinrich G. Haber D.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2143-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of endogenous WT1 by antisense oligonucleotides induces apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cell lines (36Algar E.M. Khromykh T. Smith S.I. Blackburn D.M. Bryson G.J. Smith P.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1005-1014PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, a pro-apoptotic role for WT1 has been reported: overexpression of WT1 induces apoptosis in an osteosarcoma cell line (37Englert C. Hou X. Maheswaran S. Bennett P. Ngwu C. Re G.G. Garvin A.J. Rosner M.R. Haber D.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4662-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and p53-independent programmed cell death was induced in U2OS and Saos-2 cells (38Haber D.A. Englert C. Maheswaran S. Med.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) following WT1 induction. In most cases, the pro-apoptotic effect of WT1 seems to be mediated by the splicing variant that lacks the KTS tripeptide (38Haber D.A. Englert C. Maheswaran S. Med. Pediatr.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1353-1363PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, WT1 has been described as able to down-regulate transcription of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene. Although reactive oxygen intermediates are not likely to be involved in all apoptotic processes, sympathetic neurons and neuronally differentiated PC12 cells undergo a reactive oxygen intermediate-dependent apoptosis when deprived of nerve growth factor. This phenomenon is prevented by injection of Cu,Zn-SOD (41Greenlund L.J. Deckwerth T.L. Johnson E.M.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 303-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest a function for the WT1 pathway of SOD1 regulation in the prevention of stress-induced apoptosis in neuronal cells. Superoxide dismutases (SODs)1 are found in all aerobic organisms and are thought to participate in the detoxification of reactive oxygen intermediates by catalyzing superoxide anion (O·̄2) dismutation, yielding hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and molecular oxygen (O2) (1Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). Three distinct SODs have been described in mammalian cells: a mitochondrial manganese-associated SOD, whose function is likely to detoxify superoxide anion generated by partial O2 reduction during oxidative phosphorylation; an extracellular SOD, which is found in extracellular fluids and bound to the extracellular matrix; and a cytosolic Cu,Zn-SOD, whose endogenous role remains poorly understood (2Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 3Przedborski S. Schon E.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 99-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The fundamental importance of SOD activity is illustrated in various organisms by the phenotype of mutants that do not express a form of SOD. In bacteria and yeast, SOD deficiency leads to severe growth deficits under aerobic conditions (4Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 5Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski A. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The life span ofDrosophila that lack SOD is shortened. Conversely,Drosophila that overexpress SOD and catalase can live up to 150% longer (6Phillips J.P. Campbell S.D. Michaud D. Charbonneau M. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 7Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Manganese-associated SOD-deficient mice die shortly after birth (8Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Nat.

A. 1996; 93: 9782-9787Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Human Cu,Zn-SOD is encoded by a gene (SOD1) located in the 21q22 region (10Tan Y.H. Tischfield J. Ruddle F.H. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 137: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This region is involved in the most common genetic disease, known as trisomy 21 or Down's syndrome. However, although a 1.5-fold increase inSOD1 gene expression may be associated with the disease, several Down's syndrome patients carrying a partial trisomy 21 have a normal Cu,Zn-SOD activity (11De La Torre L.T. Casado A. Lopez-Fernandez E. Carrascosa D. Ramirez V. Saez J. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 871-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has been reported that some cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a serious neurodegenerative disease, are associated with dominant mutations in the SOD1gene (12Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P. Deng H.X. Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5443) Google Scholar, 13Deng H.X. Hentati A. Tainer J.A.

However, a gain of function is likely to cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, rather than a defect of Cu,Zn-SOD activity (14Yim M.B. Kang J.H. Yim H.S. Kwak H.S. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in mice, Cu,Zn-SOD homozygous null mutants are viable and do not exhibit the neuropathological symptoms characteristic of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. However, these Cu,Zn-SOD−/− mice exhibit an enhanced neuronal cell death following axotomy or ischemia, suggesting a requirement for Cu,Zn-SOD under stress (15Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown R.H.J. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 16Kondo T.

Although Cu,Zn-SOD activity has been found modified in some specific situations including hematopoietic cell differentiation, aging, and some tumor cells (17Auwerx J.H. Chait A. Wolfbauer G. Deeb S.S. Blood. 1989; 74: 1807-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Allen R.G. Keogh B.P. Gerhard G.S. Pignolo R. Horton J. Cristofalo V.J. J. Cell.

Med. 1997; 23: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the SOD1 gene is often considered as a “housekeeping gene,” and its activity is often used as an internal control when variations of manganese-associated SOD activity are measured. We report here the analysis of the proximal region of theSOD1 gene promoter. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was used as a model agonist to identify trans- and cis-acting factors for SOD1 gene expression. We found that SOD1 gene expression is rapidly enhanced following PMA treatment. A region between nucleotides −71 and −29 was essential for both basal and PMA-induced expression. This region could be further refined to a single Sp1/Egr-1/WT1-binding site located between nucleotides −59 and −48. These findings suggest that competition between Sp1, Egr-1, and variants of WT1 (and perhaps other Sp1- or Egr-related proteins) for the same binding site may play a role in the regulation of SOD1 gene expression in response to a variety of biological signals. DISCUSSIONWe report the analysis of the human Cu,Zn-SOD gene proximal promoter. Deletion analysis of the SOD1 gene promoter suggests the existence of several regulatory sequences spread along the 5′-flanking region of the SOD1 gene. Indeed, previous reports had allowed identification of several cis-acting sequences. Two AP-2 sites located between positions −134 and −127 and positions −118 and −111 are involved in the promoter response toPanax ginseng extracts (30Kim Y.H. Park K.H. Rho H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24539-24543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An Sp1 site (positions −104 to −89) and a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) site (positions −64 to −55) have also been described (31Seo S.J. Kim H.T. Cho G. Rho H.M. Jung G. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 178: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that, although several regulatory sequences are present within 1.5 kilobases of 5′-upstream sequences, the SOD1 promoter region located between nucleotides −71 and +1 is sufficient to provide both basal and PMA-induced promoter activities. Within this region, we identified a site located between nucleotides −59 and −48 that is able to bind Sp1 constitutively and Egr-1 following PMA treatment. This sequence can also mediate transactivation by two splicing variants of the Wilms' tumor protein WT1. Interestingly, the C/EBP-binding site (positions −64 to −55) described by Seo et al. (31Seo S.J. Kim H.T. Cho G. Rho H.M. Jung G. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 178: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) partially overlaps the Sp1/Egr-1 site (positions –59 to −48) described in this study, suggesting the existence of a complex interplay between different trans-acting factors for the transcriptional regulation of the SOD1 gene.Comparison of the Sp1/Egr-1 site with consensus Sp1-, Egr-1-, or WT1-binding sites (Fig. 7) revealed that this site does not fit consensus sequences described so far (32Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). In addition, in most other sequences recognized by both Sp1 and Egr-1, the binding sites of the two proteins overlap on six nucleotides, but are not identical (27Liu C. Calogero A. Ragona G. Adamson E. Mercola D. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 101-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, Sp1 and Egr-1 sites seem to be identical or at least do not seem to differ by more than two nucleotides since we could not find a mutation that affects binding of only one of the two factors. This non-canonical Sp1/Egr-1/WT1 binding sequence might represent the prototype of a novel binding site involved in transcriptional regulation by members of the zinc finger transcription factor family. Another sequence is recognized by a possible Sp1-like protein. Surprisingly, the Sp1-like site fits perfectly the Sp1 consensus sequence, but does not seem to be involved in SOD1 transcription regulation in HeLa cells since a mutation at this site does not lead to significant modification of transcriptional activity.The apparent lack of phenotype in SOD1 null mice (15Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown R.H.J. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) indicates that Cu,Zn-SOD is probably not necessary for normal development and life, but rather is involved in the response to stress. Indeed, the only phenotype described for these mice is a partial defect in motor neuron regeneration following section. Interestingly, Egr-1 has been described as a key factor in response to mechanical stress in endothelial cells (33Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Thus, Egr-1 regulation of the SOD1gene provides a link between this key factor and Cu,Zn-SOD in response to mechanical stress in endothelial cells. Accordingly, a recent report has described an induction of Cu,Zn-SOD activity in human aortic endothelial cells in response to shear stress (34Inoue N. Ramasamy S. Fukai T. Nerem R.M. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This increase in activity was, at least in part, mediated by increased transcription of the SOD1 gene and was not observed in aortic smooth muscle cells. Although it was not demonstrated that this increase was mediated by Egr-1, we propose that Egr-1 regulation of SOD1participates, via the antioxidant properties of Cu,Zn-SOD, in an atheroprotective pathway.The function of the tumor suppressor protein WT1 in SOD1gene regulation remains unknown. A connection between WT1 and apoptotic processes has been described in several reports. WT1 stabilizes p53 and inhibits its ability to induce apoptosis in response to various stimuli (35Maheswaran S. Englert C. Bennett P. Heinrich G. Haber D.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2143-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of endogenous WT1 by antisense oligonucleotides induces apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cell lines (36Algar E.M. Khromykh T. Smith S.I. Blackburn D.M. Bryson G.J. Smith P.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1005-1014PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, a pro-apoptotic role for WT1 has been reported: overexpression of WT1 induces apoptosis in an osteosarcoma cell line (37Englert C. Hou X. Maheswaran S. Bennett P. Ngwu C. Re G.G. Garvin A.J. Rosner M.R. Haber D.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4662-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and p53-independent programmed cell death was induced in U2OS and Saos-2 cells (38Haber D.A. Englert C. Maheswaran S. Med.

ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2α phosphorylation were assessed, respectively, as indices of chaperone inactivation and the inhibition of translational initiation. Inhibition of protein processing by ER stress (ionomycin and dithiothreitol) resulted in GRP78 deribosylation and eIF-2 phosphorylation. Suppression of translation relative to ER protein processing (cycloheximide) produced approximately 50% ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 within 90 min without eIF-2 phosphorylation. ADP-ribosylation was reversed in 90 min by cycloheximide removal in a manner accelerated by ER stressors. Cycloheximide sharply reduced eIF-2 phosphorylation in response to ER stressors for about 30 min; sensitivity returned as GRP78 became increasingly ADP-ribosylated. Reduced sensitivity of eIF-2 to phosphorylation appeared to derive from the accumulation of free, unmodified chaperone as proteins completed processing without replacements. Prolonged (24 h) incubations with cycloheximide resulted in the selective loss of the ADP-ribosylated form of GRP78 and increased sensitivity of eIF-2 phosphorylation in response to ER stressors. Brefeldin A decreased ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 in parallel with increased eIF-2 phosphorylation.

Accumulation of unfolded protein in response to these agents is thought to signal a slowing of translational initiation through activation of the double-stranded RNA-stimulated eIF-2α kinase, in conjunction with eIF-2α phosphorylation and the inhibition of eIF-2 cycling (6Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Continued inhibition of processing (ER stress) results in the subsequent induction of various ER chaperones (7Welch W.J. Physiol.

GRP78/BiP, the chaperone induced most prominently and rapidly by ER stress, has been hypothesized to function in the correct folding and assembly of proteins during early protein processing (10Haas I.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 167: 71-82PubMed Google Scholar), in the retention of improperly folded proteins that accumulate within the ER lumen when processing is distressed (11Pelham H.R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), and in the co-translational translocation of nascent polypeptides from the cytosol to the ER for processing (12Vogel J.P.

Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Induction or overexpression of the chaperone confers tolerance to translational inhibition and eIF-2 phosphorylation in response to ER stress (6Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 14Morris J.A. Dorner A.J. Edwards C.A. Hendershot L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In cell types overproducing proteins that translocate to the ER but that are incapable of ER to Golgi transport, GRP78 is chronically elevated, and mRNA translation is sustained upon challenge with ER stressors (6Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). GRP78 is reported to undergo post-translational modification by mono-ADP-ribosylation and by phosphorylation (15Carlsson L. Lazarides E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4664-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Hendershot L.M. Ting J. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4250-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Both modifications involve oligomerization of the chaperone to an inactive form. When complexed with other proteins, GRP78 is not subject to covalent modification or oligomerization (17Freiden P. Gaut J. Hendershot L.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications of GRP78 are generally observed during conditions that deplete the ER of processible protein. For example, the fractional ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 is increased by lowered temperature, amino acid starvation, and treatments with cycloheximide or amino acid analogs (18Ledford B.E. Jacobs D.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Leno G.H. Ledford B.E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Ledford B.E. Leno G.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, the modification of GRP78 is suppressed by conditions that inhibit glycoprotein processing within the ER such as glucose depletion or treatments with tunicamycin, glucose analogs, or Ca2+ ionophores (15Carlsson L. Lazarides E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4664-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Leno G.H. Ledford B.E.

Bouzyk M.M. Rosengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25239-25245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also suppressed by hormones that stimulate growth (22Staddon J.M. Bouzyk M.M. Rosengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25239-25245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unmodified, unbound form of GRP78 is thought, therefore, to function as the active form of the chaperone that is available to interact with processing intermediates derived from co-translational translocation. It is this form of the chaperone that must be subject to inactivation through covalent modification. Signaling of grp78 gene expression correlates inversely with the extent to which the chaperone is covalently modified (7Welch W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 4: 1063-1081Crossref Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 8Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 9Little E. Ramakrishnan M. Roy B. Gazit G.

The present report describes an investigation of the relationship of GRP78 modification to protein processing and mRNA translation in GH3 pituitary cells utilizing isoelectric focusing methodology. ADP-ribosylation of the chaperone was increased by treatments that slow the rate of mRNA translation relative to that of protein processing. By contrast, ADP-ribosylation was decreased or reversed by treatments that slow the rate of protein processing relative to that of mRNA translation. A dynamic relationship was found to prevail between the fractional ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 and the degree of eIF-2 phosphorylation that was explicable in terms of changing contents of the active monomer. Monoclonal antibody to eIF-2α was the gift of Dr. Lynn O'Brien, University of Rochester. Polyclonal rabbit anti-GRP78 and recombinant GRP78 were purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies. Ampholines were purchased from Gallard Schlesinger (pH 4–8) and from ESA Inc. (pH 3.5–10). Urea was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. [2-3H]Adenosine and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and l-[4,5-3H]-leucine was from ICN Radiochemicals. Thapsigargin and okadaic acid were obtained from Calbiochem. Pactamycin was donated by The Upjohn Co. Ionomycin, brefeldin A, puromycin, dithiothreitol, cycloheximide, emetine, novobiocin, nicotinamide, and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Sigma. GH3 pituitary cells were maintained in suspension and utilized as described (23Chin K.-V. Cade C. Brostrom C.O. Galuska E.M. Brostrom M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16509-16514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were normally provided with fresh growth medium for approximately 16 h before harvest. Prior to treatments, cells were equilibrated for 15 min with serum-free Ham's F-10 medium modified to contain 0.2 mm Ca2+. Leucine pulse incorporations were measured as described previously (24Laitusis A.L. Brostrom C.O. Ryazanov A.G. Brostrom M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) for 10- or 15-min incubations of 2 × 106 cells per experimental condition. One-dimensional 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of detergent-solubilized extracts of variously treated cell preparations was conducted as described previously (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Cells (106) were harvested by centrifugation and lysed with 300 μl of urea buffer containing 2% ampholines (pH 3.5–10, two-dimensional), 4% Triton X-100, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 9.9 m urea. Lysates were applied to a 6% acrylamide slab gel (30% acrylamide, 1.5% bisacrylamide) containing ampholines (1:1, pH 3.5–10 to pH 4–8) and subjected to slab gel isoelectric focusing in the presence of 9.5m urea to separate the modified and unmodified forms of eIF-2α and of GRP78. Gels were treated with 1 m Tris, pH 8.8, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes under basic conditions. Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated eIF-2α were immunodetected with monoclonal antibody to eIF-2 and chemiluminescence (26Prostko C.R. Brostrom M.A. Malara E.M. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16751-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were then treated with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 15–30 min to remove the secondary antibody. GRP78 was immunodetected with primary antibody (1:5000), with goat anti-rabbit antiserum (1:5000) serving as the secondary antibody. The incubation conditions for in vitro phosphorylation of GRP78 were as described previously (27Leustek T. Toledo H. Brot N. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), except that the reaction was conducted at 37 °C for 2 h in 250 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 20 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 100 mm CaCl2, and 30 μg of recombinant GRP78. Cells were suspended to 4 × 106/ml of Ham's F-10 supplemented with 0.4 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to maintain translational rates in the absence of serum and were incubated for 2 h in the presence of [2-3H]adenosine (100 μC/ml). Cells were then diluted 2-fold with fresh medium containing [2-3H]adenosine (100 μC/ml) and incubated in the absence or presence of 50 μm cycloheximide for 1 h. Samples were then prepared for isoelectric focusing and analysis of GRP78 modification. GH3 cells (2 × 106/ml) were incubated in Ham's F-10 medium with or without 50 μm cycloheximide for 2 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and placed on ice, and lysis buffer (50 mmTris·HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added at a ratio of 0.5 ml per 106 cells. The preparations were then subjected to homogenization and sonication. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatant fractions were stored at −70 °C until use. Lysates (200 μl) and/or recombinant [32P]GRP78 (1 μg) were incubated for 2 h with 10 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Samples were treated for 18 h with 5 volumes of ice-cold acetone, and the precipitates were collected, dried, and resuspended in 100 μl urea buffer. Good evidence supports the hypothesis that GRP78 functions in part to coordinate the respective rates of ER protein processing and mRNA translation (6Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to examine GRP78 for modifications occurring in response to different classes of agents that inhibit translation. GH3 pituitary cells were chosen as a model system for the experiments in view of their extensive characterization in terms of Ca2+ homeostasis and translational control. Analyses of GRP78 modification were conducted in conjunction with determinations of amino acid incorporation into protein and measurements of the phosphorylation of eIF-2α as an index of the suppression of initiation. Relatively short incubations (30–90 min) were utilized to minimize induction of chaperone by chemical stressors that inhibit mRNA translation. Isoelectric focusing procedures permitted the separation of eIF-2α from its phosphorylated form concurrently with the separation of the unmodified and modified forms of GRP78. Both types of analyses were conducted by sequential Western blotting of the same transfer membrane. GH3 cells were initially exposed for 30 min to various direct-acting inhibitors of translational elongation (puromycin, cycloheximide, and emetine) or to pactamycin, an acknowledged inhibitor of translational initiation (Fig.1). All of these agents were strongly inhibitory to amino acid incorporation. None of them promoted eIF-2 phosphorylation (B, lanes 2–5) with respect to an untreated control (B, lane 1), but all generated a separable modified form of GRP78 (A, lanes 2–5) as compared with an untreated control (A, lane 1). The ER Ca2+-mobilizing agents, ionomycin and thapsigargin, and the reducing agent, dithiothreitol, strongly inhibit both ER protein processing and translational initiation. These agents increased eIF-2 phosphorylation (B, lanes 6–8) without generating modified GRP78 (A, lanes 6–8). During longer term exposures, these agents act as ER stressors that induce the synthesis of GRP78 but not heat shock proteins. Sodium arsenite, in contrast, modifies the sulfhydryl groups of cytoplasmic proteins. This event produces cytoplasmic stress associated with the complexing of cytoplasmic chaperones, the activation of double-stranded RNA-activated eIF-2α kinase, and the inhibition of translational initiation, and the subsequent induction of the heat shock proteins but not GRP78 (28Brostrom C.O. Prostko C.R. Kaufman R.J. Brostrom M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24995-25002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Arsenite treatment produced phosphorylation of eIF-2 (B, lane 10) in conjunction with GRP78 modification (A, lane 10). The modification of GRP78 therefore differed according to the class of agent producing translational inhibition. During the subsequent 30 min of incubation the fractional modification of GRP78 increased in the nontreated controls (C, lane 1), a typical finding associated with longer term incubations without serum. Addition of ionomycin to mobilize sequestered Ca2+ reversed this modification (C, lane 9). Replicate samples undergoing treatments that inhibited protein synthesis (C and D, lanes 2–8, and 10) were also adjusted with ionomycin to ascertain whether the cells remained responsive to an ER stressor. Ionomycin treatment decreased pre-existing modification of GRP78 resulting from conventional inhibitors of translation at either elongation (C, lanes 2–4) or at initiation (C, lane 5). The modification of GRP78 in response to arsenite was also abolished by ionomycin (C, lane 10). Cells that had been pretreated with ER stressors (C and D, lanes 6–8) were not further affected by the addition of ionomycin. Phosphorylation of eIF-2α developed following the addition of ionomycin to a previously untreated sample (D, lane 9) but not in an untreated control (D, lane 1) as well as in samples containing conventional elongation inhibitors (D, lanes 2–4). Pactamycin treatment invariably precluded eIF-2 phosphorylation in response to ER stressors (D, lane 5). Cells treated with arsenite displayed intensified eIF-2 phosphorylation in response to ionomycin (D, lane 10). Both the modified and unmodified forms of GRP78 focused as discrete protein bands without evidence of multiple banding, as would have been anticipated if multiple sites were covalently modified or if more than one type of modification was occurring. Migration of the modified GRP78 to a more acidic isoelectric position was compatible with modification by either phosphorylation or by ADP-ribosylation, each of which have been reported to occur for this chaperone. Several lines of evidence indicate that the modification of GRP78 occurring in GH3cells was compatible with ADP-ribosylation, but not with phosphorylation, of the protein. Cells that were equilibrated with [2-3H]adenosine were found to possess radioactivity in the modified but not in the unmodified form (Fig.2 A, right lanes). To generate significant radiolabeling, high cell density in conjunction with a protracted incubation without serum was utilized. This condition resulted in a substantial degree of GRP78 modification (A, left lanes). Both the fractional degree of modification and the extent of radiolabeling were further increased by cycloheximide. While these results were supportive of ADP-ribosylation, they did not preclude a potential contribution of phosphorylation to the modification of GRP78. The role of phosphorylation in the generation of modified GRP78 was examined in more detail. Purified recombinant GRP78 was autophosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP. The stability of the phosphate moiety was then tested by the addition of a cell lysate derived from GH3 cells that had been pretreated with cycloheximide to promote modification of GRP78. Isoelectric focusing and Western blotting procedures revealed one major band of recombinant GRP78 migrating to the same position as the unmodified GRP78 derived from the cell lysates (Fig. 2 B, lower lanes). The radiolabeled recombinant protein (Fig. 2 B, upper lanes), as determined by radioautography, displayed the same isoelectric behavior as the modified form of GRP78 detected in cell lysates by Western blotting. Treatment of lysates with alkaline phosphatase did not affect the proportion of GRP78 in the modified form, whereas the32P-labeled recombinant protein was stripped of radioactivity. Dephosphorylation of recombinant GRP78 also occurred in incubations with lysate but without okadaic acid or alkaline phosphatase (not shown). Both the modified and unmodified forms of GRP78 were fully accessible and susceptible to proteolysis by trypsin. ADP-ribosylation of various proteins has been reported to be inhibited by novobiocin and nicotinamide (29Banasik M. Ueda K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 138: 185-197Google Scholar). The small amount of GRP78 that was modified in control cells was found to be abolished by either agent (Fig. 2 C, upper lanes). The much larger fractional modification of GRP78 in response to cycloheximide was also completely suppressed by either novobiocin or nicotinamide (Fig. 2 C, lower lanes). Novobiocin at 50 μm was sufficient for full suppression of ADP-ribosylation (not shown). Collectively, these findings emphasize that the covalent modification of GRP78 occurring in intact GH3 cells is consistent with ADP-ribosylation of the protein as described by others (15Carlsson L. Lazarides E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4664-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Hendershot L.M. Ting J. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25239-25245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time dependence of the ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 in response to cycloheximide was examined over 90 min (Fig. 3). ADP-ribosylation did not change in untreated controls throughout this period (lanes A, left). Cells exposed to cycloheximide developed increasing degrees of ADP-ribosylation within 15 min that approached maximal values at 60 min (lanes B, left). Neither of these conditions affected eIF-2 phosphorylation (lanes A andB, right). Cycloheximide-treated cells were then washed to remove the drug such that amino acid incorporation was no longer inhibited, and the cells were analyzed for the reversal of the ADP-ribosylation of GRP78. Reversal occurred with the same time dependence as seen for the development of ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 (lanes C, left) without eIF-2 phosphorylation (lanes C, right). The reversal of ADP-ribosylation was accelerated approximately 2-fold by either ionomycin (lanes D, left) or by dithiothreitol (lanes E, left) at concentrations established to suppress protein processing and amino acid incorporation. Phosphorylation of eIF-2 in response to either agent became maximal within 15 min (lanes D andE, right). It was therefore apparent that eIF-2 phosphorylation occurred more rapidly than either ADP-ribosylation or deribosylation of GRP78. Shorter term incubations were designed to minimize deactivation of GRP78 from ADP-ribosylation in response to cycloheximide while providing sufficient time (10 min) for eIF-2 phosphorylation in response to ER stressors. It was anticipated that slowed rates of translational elongation should result in the depletion of ER-processible protein as proteins completed processing in the absence of continuing translocation. Some accumulation of the active (unmodified) form GRP78 dissociating from proteins completing processing would be anticipated in view of the relatively slow rate of inactivation of GRP78 by ADP-ribosylation. The relationship of protein synthetic rates to the ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 and the phosphorylation of eIF-2 was examined at a series of cycloheximide concentrations (0.2, 0.75, and 10 μm) (Fig.4). These concentrations produced graded inhibitions of amino acid incorporation ranging from 50 to 93%. Over 30 min ADP-ribosylation was increased by each cycloheximide concentration (lanes 1, B-D, left) as compared with that of the untreated control (lane 1A, left). Phosphorylation of eIF-2 was not altered at any cycloheximide concentration in incubations without ER stressor (lanes 1, right). Phosphorylation of eIF-2 in response to a 15-min exposure to either ionomycin (1 μm, lanes 2, right) or dithiothreitol (600 μm, lanes 3, right) was also examined in cells that had been pretreated with cycloheximide for 15 min. Under these conditions eIF-2 phosphorylation in response to stressors was sharply reduced by increasing concentrations of cycloheximide (lanes 2 and 3, right). Phosphorylation of eIF-2 in response to ER stressors was completely suppressed at cycloheximide concentrations that largely inhibited translation (lanes D, right). Modest reductions of ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 occurred in response to ionomycin (lanes 2, left) or dithiothreitol (lanes 3, left) as compared with incubations with cycloheximide alone (lanes 1, B–D, left). The effect of cycloheximide on the sensitivity of eIF-2 phosphorylation to ER stressors was examined at various times of incubation (0–90 min) at a high concentration of the elongation inhibitor (20 μm) (Fig. 5). Samples for each incubation time were adjusted with either ionomycin or dithiothreitol 15 min before collection. Concentrations of each agent were tested that were known to produce either submaximal or maximal degrees of eIF-2α phosphorylation. Cells incubated as controls without cycloheximide displayed high degrees of eIF-2 phosphorylation with either concentration of either stressor (lanes A, 2–5, right) as compared with the unstressed control (lane A1, right) which did not change throughout the course of the experiment (lanes 1, right). Samples adjusted simultaneously with cycloheximide and ER stressors for 15 min displayed much less eIF-2 phosphorylation (lanes B, 2–5, right). Samples pretreated with cycloheximide for 15 min before the addition of stressors (lanes C, 2–5, right) displayed minimal degrees of phosphorylation of eIF-2. Phosphorylation in samples adjusted at 30 min of cycloheximide treatment (lanes D, 2–5, right) was depressed to a slightly lesser extent. By 45 min of cycloheximide treatment before adjustment with stressor, eIF-2 phosphorylation had nearly recovered (lanes E, 2–5, right) to the original values observed without cycloheximide (lanes A, right). This pattern was maintained at 90 min (lanes F, 2–5, right). The simultaneous analysis of ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 was also conducted. GRP78 was not significantly modified in controls lacking cycloheximide (lanes A, 1–5, left). ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 increased with time of incubation in cells exposed to cycloheximide without ER stressors (lanes 1, B–F, left) to approximately 50% at the longest treatment period with cycloheximide (lane 1, F, left). At each time the addition of either ionomycin or dithiothreitol lowered the fraction of GRP78 that was ADP-ribosylated. Marked reductions of ADP-ribosylation occurred during shorter pretreatment periods with cycloheximide (0–30 min) (lanes B–D, 2–5, left). Cells treated for 45 or 90 min with cycloheximide before the addition of stressors exhibited more modest reversals of ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 (lanes E–F, 2–5 left). Cycloheximide-treated samples with high degrees of ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 were invariably more subject to eIF-2 phosphorylation in response to ER stressors. The ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 and the phosphorylation of eIF-2 in GH3 cells were examined for coordination during a restricted time frame (Fig. 6). Additions of cycloheximide were staged at various times with respect to adjustments"
https://openalex.org/W2069562848,"Glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to ceramide to form glucosylceramide, the precursor of most higher order glycosphingolipids. Recently, we characterized GCS activity in highly enriched fractions from rat liver Golgi membranes (Paul, P., Kamisaka, Y., Marks, D. L., and Pagano, R. E. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 2287–2293), and human GCS was cloned by others (Ichikawa, S., Sakiyama, H., Suzuki, G., Hidari, K. I.-P. J., and Hirabayashi, Y. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 4638–4643). However, the polypeptide responsible for GCS activity has never been identified or characterized. In this study, we made polyclonal antibodies against peptides based on the predicted amino acid sequence of human GCS and used these antibodies to characterize the GCS polypeptide in rat liver Golgi membranes. Western blotting of rat liver Golgi membranes, human cells, and recombinant rat GCS expressed in bacteria showed that GCS migrates as an ∼38-kDa protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Trypsinization and immunoprecipitation studies with Golgi membranes showed that both the C terminus and a hydrophilic loop near the N terminus of GCS are accessible from the cytosolic face of the Golgi membrane. Treatment of Golgi membranes with N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-based cross-linking reagents yielded an ∼50-kDa polypeptide recognized by anti-GCS antibodies; however, treatment of ∼10,000-fold purified Golgi GCS with the same reagents did not yield cross-linked GCS forms. These results suggest that GCS forms a dimer or oligomer with another protein in the Golgi membrane. The migration of solubilized Golgi GCS in glycerol gradients was also consistent with a predominantly oligomeric organization of GCS. Glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to ceramide to form glucosylceramide, the precursor of most higher order glycosphingolipids. Recently, we characterized GCS activity in highly enriched fractions from rat liver Golgi membranes (Paul, P., Kamisaka, Y., Marks, D. L., and Pagano, R. E. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 2287–2293), and human GCS was cloned by others (Ichikawa, S., Sakiyama, H., Suzuki, G., Hidari, K. I.-P. J., and Hirabayashi, Y. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 4638–4643). However, the polypeptide responsible for GCS activity has never been identified or characterized. In this study, we made polyclonal antibodies against peptides based on the predicted amino acid sequence of human GCS and used these antibodies to characterize the GCS polypeptide in rat liver Golgi membranes. Western blotting of rat liver Golgi membranes, human cells, and recombinant rat GCS expressed in bacteria showed that GCS migrates as an ∼38-kDa protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Trypsinization and immunoprecipitation studies with Golgi membranes showed that both the C terminus and a hydrophilic loop near the N terminus of GCS are accessible from the cytosolic face of the Golgi membrane. Treatment of Golgi membranes with N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-based cross-linking reagents yielded an ∼50-kDa polypeptide recognized by anti-GCS antibodies; however, treatment of ∼10,000-fold purified Golgi GCS with the same reagents did not yield cross-linked GCS forms. These results suggest that GCS forms a dimer or oligomer with another protein in the Golgi membrane. The migration of solubilized Golgi GCS in glycerol gradients was also consistent with a predominantly oligomeric organization of GCS. glucosylceramide synthase N-lauroylsarcosine 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate disuccinimidyl suberate dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) sphingomyelin synthase. Glucosylceramide is synthesized by UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase (glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)1) (1Basu S. Kaufman B. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Glucosylceramide is the common precursor of most higher order glycosphingolipids, which are important cell membrane constituents and have been implicated as important factors in development, differentiation, tumor progression, and pathogen/host interactions (5Boldin S.

Thus, GCS may play significant roles in several biological processes by regulating the overall synthesis of glucosylceramide-derived glycosphingolipids. However, surprisingly little is known about the polypeptide responsible for GCS activity. We recently solubilized and partially purified (∼10,000-fold) enzymatically active rat liver GCS (12Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2287-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We found that detergent-solubilized GCS peaked in glycerol gradients at an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa, but were unable to conclusively identify the GCS polypeptide on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Since then, GCS was cloned from a human cDNA library by rescue of a mutant mouse cell line deficient in GCS activity (13Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of the cloned enzyme encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of ∼45 kDa, but the cloned enzyme was not visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The difference between the predicted molecular mass of GCS based on its amino acid sequence and its apparent size in glycerol gradients suggests that GCS may be organized in a dimer or oligomer; however, this possibility has not yet been investigated. In addition, no homology was found between the predicted amino acid sequence of GCS and any previously known protein. Thus, except for the identification of a predicted N-terminal membrane-spanning domain (13Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and observations by us (2Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem.

Given the unresolved issues concerning the GCS polypeptide, we prepared polyclonal antibodies against peptides based on the predicted amino acid sequence of human GCS and used these antibodies to identify the GCS polypeptide, to investigate the topology of GCS in rat liver Golgi membranes, and to provide evidence that GCS is organized as a dimer or oligomer in the Golgi membrane. Golgi membrane fractions were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats (5 weeks old) as described previously (12Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2287-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Futerman A.H. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol.

Livers were homogenized (25%, w/v) in 0.25 m sucrose in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 25 mmKCl) with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml each leupeptin, tosylarginylmethyl ester, and aprotinin; 1 μg/ml each pepstatin and antipain; and 25 mm 4-amidophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (all from Sigma)) using a Polytron (Brinkmann Instruments) at setting 1 for ∼30 s. The homogenate was filtered through cheesecloth and then adjusted (150 parts homogenate and 95 parts 2 m sucrose in buffer A (v/v)) to a final concentration of 1.07 m sucrose. The adjusted homogenate (19 ml/tube) was loaded into Beckman SW 28 tubes; 9 ml each of 0.9 and 0.2 m sucrose in buffer A were then sequentially overlaid above the homogenate. The tubes were then centrifuged in an SW 28 rotor for 2 h at 83,000 ×g. Golgi fractions were collected at the 0.2/0.9m sucrose interface. To prepare right-side-out “intact” Golgi membranes, Golgi fractions were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, and the protease inhibitors as indicated above) with 20% glycerol and centrifuged for 90 min at 200,000 ×g. Golgi membrane pellets were resuspended at one-twentieth of their original volume in 0.25 m sucrose in buffer B.N-Lauroylsarcosine (NLS)-washed Golgi membranes were prepared as described previously (12Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2287-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In some experiments, NLS-washed Golgi membranes were solubilized with either 1% Igepal CA-630 (a Nonidet P-40 equivalent from Sigma) or 1% CHAPS and 0.2% Triton X-100 in buffer B. The extract was then centrifuged at 200,000 ×g, and the pellet was discarded. Fractions ∼10,000-fold enriched in GCS were prepared from NLS-washed Golgi membranes using dye-agarose columns as described previously (12Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2287-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and then concentrated and equilibrated with buffer B containing 1% Igepal CA-630 using Centricon 50 filters (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). Four synthetic peptides were synthesized based on hydrophilic regions of the predicted amino acid sequence of human GCS (13Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The peptides used were CTISWRTGRYRLRCGGTAEEILDV (referred to as GCS-1), AMQNSGSYSISQFQSRMIRWTKLRC-NH2 (GCS-2), KPLKGVDPNLINNLETFFELDYC-NH2) (GCS-5), and TRLHLNKKATDKQPYSKLPGC-NH2 (GCS-6), which correspond to amino acids 372–394, 257–280, 57–78, and 33–52, respectively, of the human GCS sequence (13Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), except that cysteine was added to the N terminus of GCS-1, and cysteine-NH2 was added to the C terminus of GCS-2, -5, and -6 to facilitate peptide conjugation. Fractions of each peptide were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. To prepare polyclonal antibodies, New Zealand White rabbits (two rabbits/peptide) were injected with peptides (500 μg of conjugate plus 100 μg of the corresponding free peptide for initial injection) in Freund's adjuvant and boosted (100 μg each of conjugate and free peptide) every 20 days. Bleeds were tested for immunoreactivity to GCS by immunoprecipitation assays and Western blotting. For some studies, antibodies were affinity-purified using the corresponding peptide conjugated to Aminolink Plus columns (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation and immunopurification of active GCS, Golgi samples were solubilized in 1% CHAPS and 0.2% Triton X-100 in buffer B. For immunoprecipitation to be followed by Western blotting, samples were solubilized in 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (radioimmune precipitation assay buffer) (16Harlowe E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 427Google Scholar), or in 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (17Larkin J.M. Palade G.E. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 205-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with affinity-purified antibodies conjugated to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma) prepared using dimethyl pimelimidate (16Harlowe E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 427Google Scholar). The samples were then centrifuged; the supernatant was saved; and the pellet was washed three times in the solubilizing buffer. Pellets and supernatants were analyzed by GCS activity assays or by Western blotting (see below). Human GCS was immunoprecipitated from lysates of differentiated cultured human keratinocytes as described (10Watanabe R. Wu K. Paul P. Marks D.L. Kobayashi T. Pittelkow M.R. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9651-9655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For immunopurification, solubilized rat Golgi GCS was eluted from antibody-bead complexes with 3m MgCl2 and 25% ethylene glycol, pH 7.2 (18Tsang V. Wilkins P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 138: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS), disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP), 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP), and sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate were from Pierce. Cross-linking reagents dissolved in Me2SO were added to Golgi fractions or detergent extracts (in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 5 mm cross-linker with 10% Me2SO. Samples were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and the cross-linkers were quenched with 100 mm Tris at 4 °C for 30 min. Finally, the samples were stored at −80 °C until they were analyzed by Western blotting. The full coding region of rat GCS was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a rat brain GCS cDNA clone. 2K. Wu, D. L. Marks and R. E. Pagano, unpublished data. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To delete a portion of the N terminus of GCS, the position of the initiating ATG codon was altered using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). GCS cDNAs were subcloned into the pET-3d expression vector and expressed in BL21(DE3) bacteria (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 30 min at 37 °C, bacterial cell pellets were harvested by centrifugation and then stored at −70 °C until use. Right-side-out Golgi membranes were prepared as described above, except that the membranes were resuspended to a final concentration of ∼3 mg/ml protein in trypsinization buffer (0.25m sucrose, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 mm EDTA). Trypsin (Worthington) was added at a ratio of 1:8 (trypsin/Golgi protein (w/w)), and samples were incubated at 37 °C. At various time points, samples were placed on ice, and soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) was added at a ratio of 20:1 (soybean trypsin inhibitor/trypsin (w/w)). Aliquots of the samples were tested for GCS and sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) activity or subjected to Western blotting as described below. For immunoisolation of Golgi vesicles, right-side-out Golgi membranes (see above) were incubated with anti-GCS antibody-bead complexes for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were washed in 0.25m sucrose in buffer A, loaded onto a 0.9 msucrose cushion in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 5 min. Under these conditions, membranes bound to beads were pelleted, whereas unbound membranes were retained at the 0.25/0.9 m sucrose interface. The distribution of Golgi membranes was assessed by measuring GCS activity in pellets and supernatants Aliquots ofN-lauroylsarcosine-washed Golgi membranes (0.5 ml) were solubilized with 1% Igepal CA-630 (see above); adjusted to 5% glycerol; and loaded onto 10.5-ml 8–25% glycerol gradients prepared in 0.3% Igepal CA-630, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml tosylarginylmethyl ester, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 25 mm 4-amidophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 200,000 × g in a Beckman SW 41 rotor at 4 °C. After centrifugation, gradient fractions (0.8 ml) were collected and analyzed for GCS activity or by Western blotting. In some cases, Igepal CA-630-solubilized samples were treated with cross-linking reagents either before or after gradient fractionation. Total microsomes were prepared as described previously (19Ehrenreich J.H. Bergeron J.J.M. Siekevitz P. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 59: 45-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). GCS and SMS activities were measured usingN-[7-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)]-6-aminocaproyl-d-erythro-sphingosine as a substrate as described (12Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2287-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Total protein was measured with Coomassie Blue dye reagent (Bio-Rad) as described (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, samples were solubilized in sample buffer (200 mm Tris base, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 8m urea, 0.4 mg/ml bromphenol blue, ±7.5 mg/ml dithiothreitol) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) using transfer buffer with 20% methanol as described (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Western blotting of the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with anti-GCS antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was performed as described (10Watanabe R. Wu K. Paul P. Marks D.L. Kobayashi T. Pittelkow M.R. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9651-9655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Signals on Western blots were visualized with chemiluminescent reagents (NEN Life Science Products) and exposed to XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). To develop antibodies against the GCS protein, we synthesized four peptides (referred to as GCS-1, -2, -5, and -6; see Fig. 1 A) based on hydrophilic regions of the predicted amino acid sequence of human GCS and injected these into rabbits. Antibodies against peptides GCS-1, -5, and -6 each recognized an ∼38-kDa polypeptide in rat liver Golgi membrane fractions and in fractions of enzymatically active GCS purified from solubilized Golgi membranes on an anti-GCS-1 antibody affinity column (Fig. 1 B), slightly lower than the predicted molecular mass (44.9 kDa) of human GCS (13Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The migration of this immunoreactive band was unchanged by the inclusion of reducing agents (data not shown). Antisera made against the GCS-2 peptide did not recognize the ∼38-kDa band or other specific bands in Western blotting or immunoprecipitations (data not shown). Western blots showed that anti-GCS-1 and anti-GCS-6 antibodies immunoprecipitated the ∼38-kDa band from Golgi fractions under mildly denaturing conditions (radioimmune precipitation assay buffer); however, the anti-GCS-5 antibody immunoprecipitated the ∼38-kDa band only under strongly denaturing conditions (data not shown). These data demonstrate that rat Golgi GCS runs as an ∼38-kDa polypeptide on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. GCS was not detected by Western blotting in crude liver fractions (homogenates or total microsomes) loaded at 20 μg/lane (Fig. 1 B), probably due to the low overall expression of GCS in liver. To further characterize the GCS polypeptide, we compared the migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels of rat Golgi GCS with that of recombinant rat GCS expressed in Escherichia coli and GCS immunoprecipitated from differentiated human keratinocytes, a cell type that expresses a high level of GCS (10Watanabe R. Wu K. Paul P. Marks D.L. Kobayashi T. Pittelkow M.R. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9651-9655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Rat GCS is 97% identical to human GCS at the amino acid level, with a predicted molecular mass of 44.8 kDa.2 Western blotting showed that rat Golgi GCS migrated identically (∼38 kDa) on SDS-polyacrylamide gels compared with rat GCS expressed in E. coli and GCS immunoprecipitated from human keratinocytes. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with the anti-GCS-1 antibody, which recognizes the C-terminal amino acids of GCS, indicated that the C terminus of GCS is present in the mature rat and human proteins (Fig. 1). To investigate the possibility that the N-terminal region of GCS is missing (due to either post-translational cleavage or GCS translation initiating from a second methionine (amino acid 11 of the rat GCS sequence), we expressed a deletion mutant that lacks the first 10 amino acids of GCS. This mutant form of GCS ran lower on Western blots than wild-type recombinant rat GCS (Fig.1 C) and, in addition, had only 4% of the activity of the wild-type form.2 Together, these data indicate that both rat and human GCS proteins migrate anomalously as ∼38-kDa polypeptides and that the full amino acid sequence, including the N terminus, is present in the mature forms. We then used the anti-GCS antibodies to further investigate the topology of GCS in the Golgi membrane. Golgi membrane fractions were incubated with a low concentration of trypsin over time; samples were then tested for GCS and SMS activities, and the integrity of the GCS polypeptide was assessed by Western blotting. In agreement with our previous study (2Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), GCS activity decreased rapidly over time, whereas SMS activity was relatively unaffected (Fig.2 A). When incubations were performed in the presence of 0.02% Triton X-100, SMS was also rapidly degraded (data not shown). These results demonstrate that, under the experimental conditions used here, the Golgi membranes are predominantly nonpermeable to trypsin and are right-side out (GCS, but not SMS, is accessible to trypsin) (2Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 23Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Western blotting using three different anti-GCS antibodies showed that GCS was rapidly degraded by trypsin, with little of the intact ∼38-kDa form present after 5 min of incubation (Fig. 2 B). The anti-GCS-1 antibody recognized only intact GCS and detected no lower molecular mass forms after trypsin treatment, suggesting that the GCS-1 epitope is readily accessible to the protease. At 5 min and later time points, an ∼35-kDa GCS fragment was recognized by both the anti-GCS-5 and anti-GCS-6 antibodies (Fig. 2 B). Finally, a third fragment (∼33 kDa), which peaked in appearance at 10 min, was recognized by only the anti-GCS-5 antibody (Fig. 2 B). At later time points, the ∼33-kDa fragment was apparently degraded as well. These results show that both the GCS-1 and GCS-6 epitopes may be cleaved by trypsin, leaving the ∼33-kDa fragment, and suggest that this fragment may be partially protected from proteolysis by its secondary structure. We noted that after 10 min of proteolysis, almost no intact GCS was recognized by the anti-GCS-1 antibody, although large fragments recognized by the other antibodies were present, and GCS activity had decreased to ∼35% of initial levels (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the C-terminal region recognized by the anti-GCS-1 antibody may be important for optimal GCS activity. Expression of a recombinant GCS mutant lacking the 8 last amino acids of the C terminus showed that it had only ∼4% activity compared with wild-type GCS,2supporting the hypothesis that the C terminus of GCS is important for activity. We then tested the ability of different anti-GCS antibodies to interactin situ with GCS in right-side-out Golgi membranes. GCS-1 immunoprecipitated most (∼80%) of the GCS activity in Golgi vesicles; GCS-6 partially immunoprecipitated activity (∼50%); but the anti-GCS-5 antibody did not immunoprecipitate activity (Fig.2 C). Taken together with the controlled proteolysis studies, these data support a model for GCS in which the C terminus (GCS-1 epitope) extends into the cytosol from the outer face of the Golgi membrane and the GCS-6 epitope forms a loop or hinge that is also partially accessible to the cytosol, whereas the GCS-5 epitope is somewhat protected by the protein secondary structure or interactions with the Golgi membrane. We next began studies to determine if GCS is organized in oligomers. Experiments in which a series of bifunctional cross-linking agents were reacted with Golgi membranes demonstrated that cross-linkers based onN-hydroxysuccinimide esters (BS, DSS, DSP, and DTSSP) consistently induced the appearance of an ∼50-kDa polypeptide recognizable by anti-GCS antibodies on Western blots (Fig.3). Additional higher cross-linked forms were also detectable, especially with the anti-GCS-1 antibody (Fig.3 A). In general, cross-linking caused an increase in the overall signal of immunoreactive material on blots, possibly due to changes in immunoreactivity after protein derivatization by cross-linkers or increased efficiency of electrophoretic transfer of higher molecular mass derivatized forms relative to the unaltered GCS monomer. When Golgi fractions were incubated with the cleavable cross-linker DTSSP, the ∼50-kDa band formed was recognized by the anti-GCS-5 antibody, but not by GCS-1 (Fig. 3 B). However, cleavage of DTSSP with dithiothreitol in these samples eliminated the ∼50-kDa band and restored the anti-GCS-1 antibody-immunoreactive monomeric GCS band. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the ∼50-kDa form is a dimer or oligomer that contains GCS, rather than an artifact caused by reaction of the cross-linker with some other protein. Additional control experiments demonstrated the following. 1) The cross-linked forms were not recognized by nonimmune sera; and 2) higher molecular mass forms were not generated by reaction of Golgi proteins with sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate, a reagent with reactivity (i.e. primary amines) similar to that of the bifunctional cross-linkers used, but that does not form cross-links (data not shown). We next compared the cross-linking of GCS in four different Golgi-derived fractions. We found that reaction of BS or DSS with intact Golgi membranes, Golgi membranes washed withN-lauroylsarcosine (∼75% of total proteins (but little GCS) are removed by this step (12Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2287-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)), and Igepal CA-630 extracts of NLS-washed Golgi membranes all yielded similar patterns of GCS-immunoreactive cross-linked forms (Fig. 3 C). Treatment of dye-agarose-purified GCS with cross-linking reagents, however, did not result in the formation of the ∼50-kDa form or other immunoreactive cross-linked species (Fig. 3 C). Similarly, reaction of Igepal CA-630-solubilized recombinant rat GCS expressed in bacteria with cross-linkers also did not generate any cross-linked GCS forms (data not shown). These results suggest that GCS in Golgi membranes specifically cross-links to a closely associated protein, which is absent in dye-agarose-purified GCS and bacterially expressed GCS (i.e. GCS in the Golgi membrane is a heterodimer or heterooligomer). To provide further characterization of GCS oligomers, we fractionated detergent-solubilized Golgi membranes on a glycerol gradient and then cross-linked each sample with 5 mm BS after gradient fractionation to “trap” any oligomeric GCS in higher molecular mass forms that would be visible by Western blotting. Without cross-linking, only the GCS monomer (∼38-kDa form) was visible by Western blotting; this form peaked early in the gradient (approximately fractions 3–5) and coincided with the peak of GCS activity (Fig.4). Note that without cross-linking, any GCS oligomers present in these fractions are dissociated by the conditions of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis so that only the GCS monomer is visualized on Western blots. In cross-linked fractions (Fig. 4 A, +BS), the GCS monomer peaked earlier (fraction 3) in the glycerol gradient than the peak of GCS activity, and most GCS-immunoreactive material appeared as cross-linked ∼50-, ∼70-, and ∼120-kDa forms that peaked later in the gradient (fractions 5 and 6). The higher molecular mass forms, including aggregated immunoreactive material present at the top of the gel, were not recognized by nonimmune antisera, but were recognized by both anti-GCS-1 (Fig. 4 A) and anti-GCS-6 (data not shown) antibodies, confirming that they represent cross-linked forms of GCS. These data show that a significant portion of solubilized GCS migrated farther in the gradient than the monomer and was cross-linkable with BS, consistent with an oligomeric structure. This study reports the development of peptide-specific anti-GCS antibodies and their use to characterize the GCS protein in rat liver. We have used the anti-GCS antibodies to visualize GCS by Western blotting for the first time and show that it runs as an ∼38-kDa protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. We used Western blotting and activity assays for GCS in conjunction with controlled proteolysis and immunoprecipitation of intact Golgi vesicles to generate new information on the topology of GCS in the Golgi membrane. Finally, we used cross-linking reagents and glycerol gradients to provide evidence that GCS is organized as a heterodimer or heterooligomer. The predicted molecular mass of both the human (13Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and rat GCS polypeptides is ∼45 kDa. We demonstrate here that rat Golgi GCS, recombinant rat GCS expressed in bacteria, and human GCS run as ∼38-kDa polypeptides on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as detected by Western blotting with peptide-specific antibodies against GCS. We have shown that the C terminus of GCS is present in these polypeptides by the use of an antibody (GCS-1) against the C-terminal 23 amino acids of GCS. We also expressed a mutant rat GCS lacking the first 10 amino acids at its N terminus. This mutant ran lower than wild-type GCS on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and had little activity, in contrast to the wild-type form, suggesting that the N terminus of GCS must also be present in the native forms. Thus, we have ruled out the possibility that the inconsistency between the predicted and empirical molecular masses of GCS is due to the loss of a portion of the N- or C-terminal region of GCS during the processing of the protein. A likely explanation for the discrepancy in molecular mass is that, because GCS is an extremely hydrophobic protein, it runs anomalously on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, as do some other hydrophobic proteins (e.g. see Ref. 24Fishburn C.S. David C. Carmon S. Wein C. Fuchs S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1460-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Previous results from our laboratory (2Futerman A.H. Pagano R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and others (3Coste H. Martel M.-B. Got R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 4Jeckel D. Karrenbauer A. Burger K.N.J. van Meer G. Wieland F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) have established that the active site of GCS is on the cytosolic face of the Golgi membrane by showing that the GCS activity of right-side-out Golgi fractions is readily accessible to proteases. Here we extend these data by demonstrating that, in right-side-out Golgi vesicles, the GCS-1 epitope at the carboxyl terminus of the protein is rapidly degraded by trypsin and is accessible to antibodies (for immunoprecipitation of Golgi vesicles). The GCS-6 epitope was slightly less accessible to trypsin and could also be used to immunoisolate Golgi vesicles, although with lower efficiency. Finally, the GCS-5 epitope appeared to be somewhat protected against trypsin and was not accessible to antibodies for immunoprecipitation except under denaturing conditions. These results suggest that the carboxyl terminus of GCS (GCS-1 epitope) and a loop (containing the GCS-6 epitope) just after the putative N-terminal transmembrane domain of GCS protrude into the aqueous environment on the cytosolic face of the Golgi membrane, whereas the region containing the GCS-5 epitope is shielded from the aqueous environment by other portions of the protein or membrane interactions. We have shown that bifunctional cross-linking reagents shift the size of GCS to ∼50 kDa and higher forms. The ∼50-kDa form could be generated from both solubilized and intact Golgi membranes, suggesting that GCS is organized in dimers/oligomers; however, treatment of dye-agarose-purified GCS or bacterially expressed rat GCS with cross-linkers did not yield any cross-linked GCS products. These results suggest that there is a specific association of GCS with a small (∼15 kDa) polypeptide normally present in Golgi membranes, but absent in the dye-agarose-purified GCS fractions. In preliminary experiments, we attempted to identify such a “GCS-associated polypeptide” by trying to immunoprecipitate GCS (and associated proteins) from both metabolically 35S-labeled proteins from cultured cells and125I-labeled rat liver Golgi proteins; however, we could not visualize GCS or associated proteins above background radioactivity in either case (data not shown), presumably because of the low levels of GCS expression. Thus, the isolation of GCS-associated polypeptide(s) will probably require an affinity purification approach using overexpressed recombinant GCS. The organization of GCS in heterodimers or heterooligomers may play a significant role in GCS localization and/or function. The oligomerization of Golgi membrane proteins has been suggested to be involved in their retention in the Golgi complex (25Sevier C.S. Machamer C.E.

Accumulating evidence indicates that Ca(2+) and calmodulin regulate the MAPK signaling pathway at multiple positions in the cascade, but the molecular mechanism underlying these observations is poorly defined. We previously documented that IQGAP1 is a scaffold in the MAPK cascade. IQGAP1 binds to and regulates the activities of ERK, MEK, and B-Raf. Here we demonstrate that IQGAP1 integrates Ca(2+) and calmodulin with B-Raf signaling. In vitro analysis reveals that Ca(2+) promotes the direct binding of IQGAP1 to B-Raf. This interaction is inhibited by calmodulin in a Ca(2+)-regulated manner. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is unable to stimulate B-Raf activity in fibroblasts treated with the Ca(2+) ionophore A23187. In contrast, chelation of intracellular free Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) significantly enhances EGF-stimulated B-Raf activity, an effect that is dependent on IQGAP1. Incubation of cells with EGF augments the association of B-Raf with IQGAP1. Moreover, Ca(2+) regulates the association of B-Raf with IQGAP1 in cells. Increasing [Ca(2+)](i) with Ca(2+) ionophores significantly reduces co-immunoprecipitation of B-Raf and IQGAP1, whereas chelation of Ca(2+) enhances the interaction. Consistent with these findings, increasing and decreasing [Ca(2+)](i) increase and decrease, respectively, co-immunoprecipitation of calmodulin with IQGAP1. Collectively, our data identify a previously unrecognized mechanism in which the scaffold protein IQGAP1 couples Ca(2+) and calmodulin signaling to B-Raf function."

MAGUK proteins are typically localized in specific membrane domains such as cell junctions in epithelial cells (10Anderson J.M. Curr.

Much of what is known about PDZ protein function has come from studies of the PSD-95 family of MAGUK proteins that are predominantly localized in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses in the brain. The first two PDZ domains, PDZ1 and PDZ2, of PSD-95 bind specifically to a peptide sequence at the very C terminus of Shaker-type potassium channels and of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR2 subunits (14Kornau H.-C.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Recent studies have investigated the molecular mechanisms of ion channel clustering by PSD-95. Channel-clustering activity is dependent on the multimerization of PSD-95, which is mediated by a stretch of ∼64 amino acids in the N-terminal region of the protein (termed the N-segment) (18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Two members of the PSD-95 family, PSD-95 and chapsyn-110, can heteromultimerize with each other because they both contain the N-segment at their N-terminal ends. Moreover, a pair of cysteine residues, Cys3 and Cys5, is conserved in the N-terminal regions of PSD-95 and chapsyn-110. Mutation of either or both of these cysteines abolishes multimerization and the channel-clustering activity of PSD-95 (18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Based on biochemical experiments in vitro and in vivo, it was hypothesized that Cys3 and Cys5 formintermolecular disulfide bonds that stabilize the N-segment-mediated multimerization of PSD-95 (18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). More recently, these N-terminal cysteines have also been found to be sites for fatty acid modification (palmitoylation) of PSD-95 (22Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These investigators reported that mutation of Cys3 and Cys5 inhibited the association of PSD-95 with membranes and prevented PSD-95 from binding to the potassium channel Kv1.4 in heterologous cells. This would provide an alternative explanation of why Cys3 and Cys5 mutations abolish Kv1.4 clustering by PSD-95. The conclusion reached by Topinka and Bredt (22Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) is somewhat surprising because there are other members of the PSD-95 family that lack these N-terminal cysteines (e.g. SAP97 and the Drosophila homolog Discs large). SAP97 and Discs large (Dlg) are nevertheless membrane-associated proteins (17Kim E. Cho K.-O. Rothschild A. Sheng M.

In re-examining the role of the N-segment and of Cys3 and Cys5 in more detail, we report here that mutation of these N-terminal cysteines has no detectable effect on the PSD-95 binding of Kv1.4, although it abolishes the ability of PSD-95 to self-associate and to cluster Kv1.4 at the cell surface. Thus Kv1.4 binding and homomultimerization are separable functions of PSD-95, and the former activity is not dependent on the N-terminal cysteines. Moreover, we demonstrate that cysteine mutants of PSD-95 lose their ability to form a ternary complex with Kv1.4 and the cell adhesion molecule FasII, implying that multimerization is required for PSD-95 to bind simultaneously to two different PDZ ligands. All PSD-95 constructs used here contain a Myc epitope tag inserted between residue 9 and 10 of PSD-95. Expression constructs GW1-PSD-95, GW1-PSD-95 (C3S/C5S), GW1-N-GFP, GW1-N-PDZ12, and GW1-N-PDZ12(C3S/C5S) have been described previously (18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To construct HA-tagged PSD-95, the Myc cassette in Myc-tagged PSD-95 was replaced by an HA epitope. For the GFP-N construct, the Myc-tagged N-segment (corresponding to residues 1–64 of PSD-95) was polymerase chain reaction amplified from Myc-tagged PSD-95 and subcloned into plasmid EGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). To construct Myc-tagged SAP97, an AscI restriction site was introduced between residues 435 and 436 of SAP97 in GW1-CMV by inverse polymerase chain reaction, and a duplex oligonucleotide encoding the Myc epitope tag was inserted into the AscI site. GW1 expression constructs of WT Kv1.4, Kv1.4 C-terminal mutant (Kv1.4VA), WT FasII, and FasII C-terminal mutant (FasIIVA) have been described previously (15Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N.

The sites in the PSD-95 protein recognized by CSK and HM319 antibodies are indicated in Fig. 1. Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 and HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. FasII monoclonal antibodies 1D4 were kindly provided by Dr. Corey S. Goodman. Transfection was performed using the LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's directions (Life Technologies, Inc.). For immunoprecipitation, COS-7 cells in 35-mm plates at 50–70% confluency were incubated with a 1-ml Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) mixture containing 1.6 μg of DNA and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 h followed by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 48 h later, cells were harvested and lysed in 0.45 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer. One-third of the cell lysate was incubated with CSK antibodies or Kv1.4 antibodies at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml at 4 °C for 2 h. 20 μl of 1:1 slurry of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1–2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed with a series of buffers: first, radioimmune precipitation buffer; second, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 m LiCl; third, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 m LiCl; and finally, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5). The immunoprecipitates were eluted in SDS-loading buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by immunoblotting using 0.2 μg/ml Myc 9E10 or Kv1.4 antibodies. For immunocytochemistry, transfected COS-7 cells were fixed by 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline for 1 min, and blocked with 3% horse serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 1 μg/ml at room temperature for 1 h, followed by Cy3- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. Results were viewed with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope, and images were prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop. Transfected COS-7 cells were suspended in 800 μl of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and broken by Dounce homogenization. Total cell extracts were centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min twice. The supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to separate crude membrane pellet and S100 soluble fraction. Crude membrane pellets were further washed with either homogenization buffer, 1 m NaCl, or 100 mm sodium carbonate-buffered homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Equal fractions of crude membrane pellet, S100 cytosolic fraction, final washed pellet, and soluble fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using the HA antibody for WT PSD-95 and the Myc antibody for N-terminal cysteine mutant, PSD-95-CS. In an earlier study, we showed that deletion mutants of PSD-95 lacking a short N-terminal region of the protein (residues 1–64, termed the N-segment) (Fig.1) lost the ability to form homomultimers (18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus the N-segment is required for self-association of PSD-95. Moreover, the N-segment is sufficient to confer multimerization on a heterologous protein. A chimeric protein containing the N-segment from PSD-95 linked to the green fluorescent protein (Fig. 1,N-GFP) could be coimmunoprecipitated with wild type full-length PSD-95 using CSK antibodies directed against the SH3 domain of PSD-95 (Fig. 2 A) (18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the absence of PSD-95, N-GFP was not precipitated by CSK antibodies; furthermore, GFP itself (lacking the N-segment) cannot be coimmunoprecipitated with PSD-95 (data not shown) (18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the N-segment alone can confer on a heterologous protein (GFP) the ability to associate with PSD-95. Interestingly, a chimeric protein in which the PSD-95 N-segment is fused to the C-terminal end of GFP (diagrammed in Fig. 1,GFP-N) was unable to associate with full-length PSD-95 by the co-immunoprecipitation assay, despite being efficiently expressed (Fig. 2 A). This suggests that the N-segment has to be placed at an N-terminal location to self-associate. The GFP moiety, when placed at the N-terminal end but not when placed at the C-terminal end of the N-segment, may sterically interfere with self-association mediated by the N-segment. The N-terminal cysteine residues Cys3and Cys5 are conserved between PSD-95 and chapsyn-110; these members of the PSD-95 family can form homomultimers with themselves and heteromultimers with each other (17Kim E. Cho K.-O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To confirm that Cys3 and Cys5 are important for multimerization of PSD-95, both these cysteines were substituted with serines in the context of two different constructs of PSD-95 (generating N-PDZ12-CS and PSD-95-CS) (see Fig. 1). These double cysteine mutants were assayed for multimerization in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Unlike wild type N-PDZ12, the N-PDZ12-CS mutant could not be precipitated by CSK antibodies in the presence of full-length PSD-95 (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the Cys3 and Cys5 residues are essential for PSD-95 self-association. In previous studies, we presented evidence that PSD-95 can form disulfide-linked multimeric complexes through residues Cys3 and Cys5 (18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To make sure that the association of full-length PSD-95 and N-PDZ12 is not because of artifactual disulfide bonding that occurred during cell lysis,N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was included in the lysis buffer at 10 mm to inactivate free sulfhydryl groups. Even in the presence of NEM, N-PDZ12 was still as efficiently associated with full-length PSD-95 as in standard lysis conditions (Fig.2 C). The same result was obtained with 20 mm NEM added to the cell culture for 20 min prior to cell harvesting (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that PSD-95 multimerization requires Cys3 and Cys5; however, PSD-95 multimerization is not because of artifactual oxidation of these residues during or after cell extract preparation. The double cysteine mutants N-PDZ12-CS and PSD-95-CS lack multimerization activity (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, these mutants are incapable of forming cell surface-associated clusters with Shaker-type potassium channel Kv1.4 in heterologous cells (Fig.3 A) (data not shown for N-PDZ12-CS). Wild type PSD-95 formed plaque-like coclusters with Kv1.4 in doubly transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 A, a), as has been shown previously (15Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 17Kim E. Cho K.-O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These PSD-95-Kv1.4 coclusters are on or closely associated with the cell surface (25Kim E. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, in COS cells coexpressing Kv1.4 and double cysteine PSD-95 mutants, the typical plaque-like coclusters did not form (Fig. 3 A, b) (data for N-PDZ12-CS not shown). Instead, both Kv1.4 and PSD-95 cysteine mutants were often concentrated in brightly staining intracellular structures that colocalized with each other. These intracellular structures were typically spherical and had brightly immunoreactive perimeters, suggesting that they were membrane-bound. The membranous nature of these stained structures is consistent with the fact that the Kv1.4 ion channel is an integral membrane protein. The appearance of the intracellular staining seen with Kv1.4 and PSD-95-CS is strikingly reminiscent of that seen upon coexpression of Kv1.4 and SAP97 in COS-7 cells (25Kim E. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This may reflect a similarity between SAP97 and PSD-95-CS in that SAP97 naturally lacks any N-terminal cysteines equivalent to Cys3 and Cys5. A recent report suggested that mutations of Cys3 and Cys5 prevent PSD-95 from binding to Kv1.4 in COS cells, as measured by coimmunoprecipitation assays (22Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, we find that double cysteine mutants of PSD-95 coimmunoprecipitate as efficiently with Kv1.4 as does wild type PSD-95 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the inability of PSD-95 cysteine mutants to form surface clusters with Kv1.4 is not because of their inability to bind to the potassium channel. The ability of double cysteine mutants of PSD-95 to bind Kv1.4 is further supported by the colocalization of these proteins in the brightly staining intracellular structures. Another member of the PSD-95 family, SAP97, has an additional 94 amino acids preceding its N-segment-like region, and it does not contain a pair of cysteine residues at its N terminus. We tested for an interaction between SAP97 and Kv1.4 by the coimmunoprecipitation assay. When coexpressed in COS-7 cells, SAP97 was readily co-precipitated by anti-Kv1.4 antibodies in the presence of Kv1.4 (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that SAP97 and Kv1.4 can form a stable complex. This result reinforces the conclusion that N-terminal cysteines are not required for biochemical association of PSD-95 family proteins with Kv1.4 and perhaps other membrane protein-binding partners. Taken together, the above data indicate that residues Cys3and Cys5 of PSD-95 are required for PSD-95 multimerization and for formation of surface-associated clusters with Kv1.4. However, unlike Topinka and Bredt (22Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we find that these N-terminal cysteines are not important for Kv1.4 channel binding by PSD-95 or its relatives. Because Cys3 and Cys5 are the defined sites of palmitoylation in PSD-95 (22Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), our data imply that palmitoylation is not essential for the interaction of PSD-95 with membrane ion channels. To examine whether Cys3and Cys5 play a role in the membrane association of PSD-95, we compared the biochemical fractionation of HA-tagged wild type PSD-95 and Myc-tagged PSD-95-CS mutant coexpressed in COS-7 cells. The relative distribution of wild type and cysteine mutant PSD-95 could then be followed in the same extracts by immunoblotting with HA and Myc antibodies, respectively. In COS cells, the majority of both the wild type PSD-95 and the PSD-95-CS mutant were found in the cytosolic (S100) fraction, although substantial amounts were associated with the crude membrane fraction (Fig. 4). The association of PSD-95 with membranes was investigated further by extracting with high salt or high pH buffers. Sodium carbonate buffer (PH11) was slightly more efficient than 1 m NaCl in extracting PSD-95 from the crude membrane fraction; however, there was no major difference between wild type PSD-95 and PSD-95-CS with regard to sensitivity to these conditions (Fig. 4). Although PSD-95-CS was perhaps more efficiently extracted than wild type PSD-95, the difference was slight in contrast to the qualitative difference observed by Topinka and Bredt (22Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The amount of PSD-95-CS that remained associated with membranes after extraction with high salt or PH11 buffer was similar to that of wild type PSD-95 (Fig. 4). PSD-95 and its Drosophila homolog Dlg have recently been shown to bind via their PDZ domains to the cell adhesion molecule FasII as well as to the Shaker potassium channel (20Thomas U. Kim E. Kuhlendahl S. Koh Y.H. Gundelfinger E.D. Sheng M. Garner C.C. Budnik V. Neuron. 1997; 19: 787-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 21Zito K. Fetter R.D. Goodman C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Indeed, Dlg can form a ternary complex with Shaker and FasII proteins in heterologous cells, although Shaker and FasII have the same binding specificity for PDZ2 of Dlg/PSD-95 (20Thomas U. Kim E. Kuhlendahl S. Koh Y.H. Gundelfinger E.D. Sheng M. Garner C.C. Budnik V. Neuron. 1997; 19: 787-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We asked whether PSD-95 can form a ternary complex with Kv1.4 and FasII and whether this ability depended on multimerization of PSD-95. That is, can a cysteine mutant of PSD-95 that cannot multimerize bind simultaneously to Kv1.4 and FasII? COS-7 cells were triply transfected with Kv1.4, FasII, and either WT PSD-95 or PSD-95-CS mutant, and the cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with Kv1.4 antibodies. The presence of FasII in the Kv1.4 immunoprecipitate was taken to imply existence of the Kv1.4-PSD-95-FasII ternary complex (Fig.5). FasII was precipitated by Kv1.4 antibodies in the presence of wild type PSD-95, but not PSD-95-CS mutant (Fig. 5, lanes 7 and 10), indicating that residues Cys3 and Cys5 of PSD-95 are required for ternary complex formation. The C-terminal FasII(VA) mutant, which cannot interact with the PDZ2 domain of PSD-95, could not be coprecipitated with Kv1.4 and PSD-95 (Fig. 5, lane 11). Moreover, the C-terminal Kv1.4(VA) mutant, which cannot interact with PSD-95, could not coprecipitate either PSD-95 or FasII (Fig. 5,lane 12). These controls confirm that the ternary complex is mediated by C-terminal tail interactions with PDZ domains and that the immunoprecipitating antibodies (anti-Kv1.4) do not cross-react with PSD-95 or FasII. The requirement for N-terminal residues Cys3 and Cys5 in formation of the ternary complex suggests that a single monomer of PSD-95 cannot bind simultaneously to FasII and Kv1.4. Two properties appear to be essential for ion channel clustering by PSD-95 in heterologous cells: 1) the ability of PSD-95 to bind directly to the ion channel by a PDZ-mediated interaction (17Kim E. Cho K.-O. Rothschild A. Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 25Kim E. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); and 2) the ability of PSD-95 to self-associate into multimers (18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of PSD-95 that lack the Kv1.4-binding domains PDZ1 and PDZ2 lose Kv1.4-clustering activity (18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of PSD-95 that lack the N-segment responsible for multimerization are also unable to cluster Kv1.4 (18Hsueh Y.-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Multimerization of PSD-95 and surface clustering of Kv1.4 are dependent on a pair of cysteines in the N-segment of PSD-95 (Cys3 and Cys5). These cysteines are potential sites for disulfide bonding and/or palmitoylation. Palmitoylation of these cysteine residues has been proposed to mediate membrane association of PSD-95 and to allow its binding to Kv1.4, a membrane ion channel (22Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, we find that these palmitoylation sites are not required for Kv1.4 binding. Nor did the presence or absence of these cysteines have a major effect on the biochemical association of PSD-95 with membranes, at least when tested in heterologous cells. Perhaps most significantly, natural homologs of PSD-95 that lack these cysteines (such as SAP97 and Dlg) interact efficiently with Shaker-type potassium channels in heterologous cells and in native tissues (19Tejedor F.J. Bokhari A. Rogero O. Gorczyca M. Zhang J. Kim E. Sheng M. Budnik V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kim E. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Taken together, it seems unlikely that palmitoylation of Cys3 and Cys5 is essential for membrane association of PSD-95 or for PSD-95 interaction with Kv1.4 or other binding partners in the membrane. Although palmitoylation is not critical for membrane interactions of PSD-95 in general, it may facilitate the targeting of PSD-95 specifically to the plasma membrane. We noted that cysteine mutants of PSD-95 tended to be trapped in intracellular membranous organelles (Fig. 3 A). Our results are still consistent with the possibility that disulfide bond formation involving Cys3 and Cys5 is important in the ability of PSD-95 to organize large two-dimensional clusters of ion channels at the cell surface. Given the potential significance of these two cysteines for PSD-95 and chapsyn-110 function, it would be valuable to examine in greater detail the relative roles played by palmitoylation and disulfide bonding of these two residues. Whatever the chemical modifications of Cys3 and Cys5, it is clear that these cysteine residues are required for the N-segment-mediated multimerization of PSD-95. Mutations of these residues abolish PSD-95 self-association (Fig. 2 B). The coimmunoprecipitation experiments in the presence of NEM are consistent with PSD-95 being multimerized prior to cell lysis via disulfide bonds involving Cys3 and Cys5. Alternatively, N-segment multimerization may be mediated by noncovalent bonds, and the Cys3 and Cys5 residues could be important in some other way for the structure and function of the N-segment. It is also possible that palmitoylation is required for the multimerization mediated by the N-segment, although the mechanism of such involvement is unclear. The other major conclusion of this study is that the N-terminal cysteines are required for PSD-95 to coordinate a ternary complex of two distinct membrane proteins, FasII and Kv1.4. Mutation of Cys3 and Cys5 does not affect Kv1.4 binding by PSD-95, but it prevents association of Kv1.4 and FasII together in a PSD-95-based complex (Fig. 5). The simplest explanation of these results is that a single monomer of PSD-95 cannot bind simultaneously to both FasII and Kv1.4. Rather, the ternary complex is constructed on a multimer of PSD-95, each monomer of PSD-95 binding individually to either Kv1.4 or FasII. Such a mechanism neatly explains how PSD-95 can form a ternary complex with two distinct membrane proteins, both of which have the same binding preference for PDZ2 of PSD-95. In vivo, there are multiple proteins that have overlapping specificities for the various PDZ domains of PSD-95. A multimeric scaffold of PSD-95 based on N-segment-mediated association would provide a simple mechanism for several different proteins with the same PDZ specificity to be brought together in a physical complex.

Previous studies have established that repression function of the complex is performed by one subunit of the complex, the Tup1 protein, and requires specific components of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme such as Sin4 and Rgr1. In this study we test the transcriptional activity of the Cyc8 subunit using a lexAoperator-containing reporter. We show that a LexA-Cyc8 hybrid stimulates transcription when expressed in atup1Δ, a sin4Δ, or a rgr1Δstrain, suggesting that transcriptional activation is an intrinsic property of the Cyc8-Tup1 co-repressor. In support of this notion we demonstrate that Cyc8-Tup1 has a dual function on CIT2, a gene encoding a citrate synthase that is expressed upon mitochondrial dysfunction. First, we show that Cyc8-Tup1 is tethered toCIT2 promoter by interacting with the activation domain of Rtg3, a bHLH/L-Zip DNA-binding transactivator of CIT2. Next we demonstrate that Cyc8-Tup1 activates CIT2 transcription in response to mitochondrial dysfunction, and this stimulatory effect is mediated by Cyc8. In contrast, basal (noninduced) expression of this gene is inhibited by Tup1. These findings establish a positive role for the Cyc8-Tup1 complex in transcription and support a model by which specific metabolic signals may convert the Cyc8-Tup1 transcriptional co-repressor to a co-activator of certain promoters.

An important class of pleiotropic transcriptional regulators includes intermediary proteins such as co-activators and co-repressors. These protein factors are tethered to specific promoters mainly by contacting DNA-binding factors and regulate transcription either by interacting with components of the Pol II holoenzyme or by modifying chromatin structure, or both (1Kingston R.E.

Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar) are among the best characterized examples of this growing protein family. Interestingly, some of these factors have dual function on specific promoters; for example CBP/p300, which mediates activation of interferon β gene expression in response to virus induction is also responsible for post-induction turn off (35Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two physically associated proteins, Cyc8(Ssn6) and Tup1, inhibit the transcription of many diversely regulated genes when their expression is not required (6Williams F.E. Varanasi U. Trumbly R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3307-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Keleher C.A. Redd M.J. Schultz J. Carlson M. Johnson A.D.

It is well established that Cyc8-Tup1 acts as a co-repressor complex that does not bind DNA directly but is recruited to different promoters via interactions with specific DNA-binding regulatory proteins. The repression function of the complex is performed by a specific domain of Tup1 (8Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). When the Tup1 repression domain is brought upstream of an active test promoter through the DNA binding domain of LexA, it inhibits transcription independently of Cyc8. Moreover, this domain is required for repression of natural genes such as glucose, oxygen, and cell-type regulated genes. It has been postulated that multiple mechanisms are responsible for Tup1 repression. Tup1 interacts with histones H3 and H4 and may position nucleosomes over the transcription start point, suggesting that Tup1 might repress transcription by modifying chromatin structure (9Roth S.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). However, evidence from other studies argue that Tup1 inhibits the function of the basic transcription machinery; Tup1 repression was reconstituted in an in vitro transcription system in the absence of chromatin (11Herschbach B.M. Arnaud M.B. Johnson D.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and mutations in specific components of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex, such as the mediator proteins Sin4, Rgr1, Srb10, and Srb11, weaken the Tup1 repression activity (12Sakai A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Previous studies suggested that Cyc8 does not directly inhibit transcription but contacts specific DNA-binding regulatory proteins (8Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar,18Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of Cyc8 consists of 10 tandem repeats of a sequence motif termed tetratrico peptide repeat (TPR)1 (16Schultz J. Marshall-Carlson L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4744-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). TPRs serve as protein-protein interaction domains, and more importantly in the case of Cyc8, TPRs exhibit distinct interaction specificity although they are similar in primary structure (17Smith R.L. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Tzamarias D. Struhl K.

TPR1, TPR2, and TPR3 contact Tup1, while different combinations of TPR4 to TPR10 mediate recruitment of Cyc8-Tup1 to different promoters (18Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Based on these observations it was proposed that the function of Cyc8 is to link Tup1 to distinct, structurally dissimilar, DNA-bound repressor proteins. Consistently with this linker function, derivatives of Cyc8 that contain only the TPR domain are sufficient for repression. On the other hand, the C-terminal domain which comprises more than half of the protein appears to be dispensable (16Schultz J. Marshall-Carlson L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4744-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Smith R.L. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).Recent genetic data suggested that Cyc8-Tup1 might also play a positive role in transcriptional control. More specifically, activation of theCYC1 gene transcription by the Hap1 transactivator and maximal induction of SUC2 gene both require functional Cyc8 protein (26Zhang L. Guarente L. Genetics. 1994; 136: 813-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ozcan S. Vallier L.G. Flick J.S. Carlson M. Johnston M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this report, we present direct evidence that Cyc8-Tup1 indeed plays diverse roles in transcriptional regulation. Expression of Cyc8-Tup1 repressible genes is stimulated in response to specific signals, and under these conditions, the fate of the Cyc8-Tup1 co-repressor has been unclear for most of the cases. Our data suggest that this complex can convert to a co-activator of CIT2, a gene encoding a peroxisomal isoform of citrate synthase that is expressed upon inducing conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction (21Lewin A.S. Hines V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We show that Cyc8-Tup1 is tethered to the CIT2 promoter by interacting with Rtg3, a DNA-binding transactivator of CIT2. Genetic analysis indicates that basal (uninduced) expression ofCIT2 is inhibited by Tup1, but its transcriptional activation is mediated by the second component of the complex, the Cyc8 subunit and specifically requires the C-terminal domain of this protein.The transcriptional activity of Cyc8 was further examined using a synthetic reporter promoter and a LexA-Cyc8 hybrid. Previous studies have shown that LexA-Cyc8 represses transcription by recruiting the Tup1 repressor (18Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Here we show that LexA-Cyc8 can activate transcription when Tup1 is absent or when the Tup1 repression is substantially impaired, as it is in a sin4Δ or argr1Δ mutant strain. Taken together, these data suggest an inherent potential of the Cyc8-Tup1 co-repressor for transcriptional activation function and establish a dual role (positive and negative) of this complex in transcriptional control.DISCUSSIONIn this study we provide direct evidence for a dual role of Cyc8-Tup1 in transcriptional control. We found that besides the well established repression activity, which is performed by Tup1, the Cyc8-Tup1 protein complex can also act as a transcriptional co-activator, and this function is predominantly mediated by the Cyc8 protein. When the Tup1 repression activity is impaired, as it is in asin4 or a rgr1 mutant strain, Cyc8-Tup1 activates an artificial reporter gene, and in response to specific metabolic signals, activates the transcription of the natural CIT2gene.Transcription of CIT2 is controlled by Rtg3 and Rtg1, both members of the bHLH/Zip family of DNA-binding proteins. Recombinant Rtg3 and Rtg1 bind as a heterodimer at two sites within an upstream activation sequence of the CIT2 gene termed UASr(31Rothermel B.A. Shyjan A.W. Etheredge J.L. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Kos W. Kal A.J. van Wilpe S. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Heterologous promoters bearing a UASr respond to mitochondrial dysfunction in a Rtg1/Rtg3-dependent manner indicating that UASr is sufficient to mediateCIT2 regulation (30Liao X.S. Small W.C. Srere P.A. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Notably, EMSAs using whole yeast extracts (instead of recombinant Rtg1 and Rtg3 proteins) suggested that additional yeast proteins, probably co-activators or co-repressors, associate with the DNA-bound Rtg1-Rtg3 heterodimer (29Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our results show that Cyc8 and Tup1 are indeed components of this UASr-bound protein complex. The Cyc8-Tup1 complex associates with Rtg3 in vivo and in vitro, and a DNA fragment encompassing two Rtg3/Rtg1-binding sites (UASr) gives rise to a stable protein-DNA complex, the formation of which is dependent on the presence of the Cyc8 TPR domain. Consistently, Rtg3 interaction is mediated by two specific TPR regions of Cyc8, TPR4 to TPR7 and TPR8 to TPR10. A third separate region, TPR1 to TPR3, associates with Tup1 (18Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 33Carrico P.M. Zitomer R.S. Genetics. 1998; 148: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar) explaining how tandem TPRs can link different proteins and assemble multiprotein complexes. Based on these observations, we propose that recruitment of Cyc8-Tup1 to theCIT2 promoter is mediated by specific TPRs that are responsible for linkage of Cyc8 to Tup1 and of that complex to the Rtg1/Rtg3 heterodimer.Several lines of evidence suggest that Cyc8-Tup1 is directly involved in the activation of CIT2 transcription and that this function is performed by the Cyc8 subunit. First, Cyc8-Tup1 specifically associates with the activation domain of Rtg3. This region of Rtg3 has been shown to be the major activation domain of the Rtg1/Rtg3 heterodimer because Rtg1, which does not possess independent transactivation properties, functions to recruit Rtg3 to its binding site (28Rothermel B.A. Thornton J.L. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19801-19807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, a possible role of the Rtg1/Rtg3 activation domain is to simply contact the Cyc8-Tup1 complex. Second, deletion ofCYC8 or deletion of both CYC8 and TUP1(data not shown) severely reduces the levels of CIT2mRNA under inducing conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction. Under these conditions, CIT2 transcription is defective even in the presence of Cyc8 derivatives (N300 and N597) that fully complement all known cyc8Δ-specific phenotypes, including slow growth and temperature-sensitive lethality (18Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These results suggest that lower CIT2 transcription is not an indirect physiological effect of the cyc8Δ mutation. In agreement to this, deletion of TUP1, which causes similar pleiotropic defects as cyc8Δ, does not significantly affect the levels ofCIT2 mRNA under inducing conditions. Third, when brought to a LexA operator-containing reporter, LexA-Cyc8 activates transcription in a tup1Δ strain. Similarly, the LexA-Cyc8/Tup1 protein complex activates transcription in an isogenicsin4Δ or a rgr1Δ strain that lacks the respective factor essential for Tup1 repression. These data, together with previous observations (26Zhang L. Guarente L. Genetics. 1994; 136: 813-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ozcan S. Vallier L.G. Flick J.S. Carlson M. Johnston M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), establish a positive role of Cyc8 in transcription and moreover they suggest a dual, positive and negative, function of the Cyc8-Tup1 protein complex on CIT2. Indeed Cyc8-Tup1 inhibits the basal (uninduced) expression ofCIT2, and this function is performed by Tup1.CIT2 transcription is derepressed in cells carrying thetup1Δ mutation while in cells that express Tup1, but lack Sin4 or Rgr1, CIT2 derepression occurs at even higher levels. This observation further suggests that Cyc8 activation function is better performed in the context of the Cyc8-Tup1 protein complex.Our data indicate that CIT2 transcription requires the C-terminal domain of Cyc8, and in fact, this is the only case that a function has been assigned to this region. When bound upstream of a test promoter through a heterologous DNA-binding domain this C-terminal region of Cyc8 does not activate transcription (data not shown); therefore it does not function as a typical activation domain, but rather plays a regulatory role. Cyc8 is a phosphoprotein, and specific regions within this C-terminal domain, rich in serine and threonine residues, are potential phosphorylation sites (16Schultz J. Marshall-Carlson L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4744-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similarly, Rtg3 contains a serine/threonine-rich region which might also play a regulatory role (28Rothermel B.A. Thornton J.L. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19801-19807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that specific modifications of these protein domains, such as phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, may in fact modulate the transcriptional activity of Cyc8-Tup1. Some of these modifications, particularly in the C-terminal domain of Cyc8, are likely to be specific for the retrograde response of CIT2 as this domain is dispensable for the regulation of all other Cyc8-Tup1 repressible genes.The signal(s) that mediate induction of peroxisomal genes upon mitochondrial dysfunction are presently unknown, and although several possible models can be envisaged using the available data, the molecular mechanism by which Cyc8-Tup1 is converted from a co-repressor to a co-activator of CIT2 is not yet understood. One model predicts that, upon induction, Tup1 dissociates from the complex thus unmasking Cyc8 activation potential. However, EMSAs performed with protein extracts derived from either normal or mitochondria defective cells detect neither quantitative nor qualitative differences on UASr DNA-protein complexes (21Lewin A.S. Hines V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,29Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). 4R. S. Conlan and D. Tzamarias, unpublished observations. This observation also argues against the model according to which additional positive regulatory factors associate with Rtg3/1-bound Cyc8-Tup1 assembling an activator complex, although transient interactions with such factors cannot be excluded. Another, more plausible, model postulates that in response to specific signaling, Cyc8-Tup1 undergoes post-translational modifications which could reveal the intrinsic activation potential of Cyc8. Masking of Tup1 repression, although possible, cannot solely account for the activation function of the complex because Cyc8-mediated CIT2 induction is observed even in the absence of Tup1 (tup1Δ strain, Fig. 4 A). Regulatory mechanisms by which proteins undergo conformational changes and activate transcription have been previously reported, and in some cases, as that of the retinoic acid receptor, these mechanisms have been characterized extensively (34Westin S. Kurokawa R. Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Mclnerney E.M. Rose D.W. Milburn M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 395: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that Cyc8 undergoes specific structural changes, i.e. by phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain, which is specifically required for stimulation of CIT2 transcription, and this could possibly be the key step through which the complex attains its activation potential. It must be emphasized that according to this model post-translational modifications of Cyc8 and probably of Tup1 have such an effect only when the complex is associated with the Rtg3/1 proteins. This hypothesis explains why Cyc8-Tup1 has a dual function only in CIT2 expression and why DNA-bound LexA-Cyc8/Tup1 is not converted to an activator of a synthetic reporter under inducing conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction (data not shown). Finally, it is known that Cyc8-Tup1 functionally interacts with the basic transcription machinery as well as with chromatin (15Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); thus it is conceivable that Cyc8 might activate CIT2 transcription by affecting either one or even both processes. An important class of pleiotropic transcriptional regulators includes intermediary proteins such as co-activators and co-repressors. These protein factors are tethered to specific promoters mainly by contacting DNA-binding factors and regulate transcription either by interacting with components of the Pol II holoenzyme or by modifying chromatin structure, or both (1Kingston R.E. Bunker C.A. Imbalzano A.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 2Shibata H. Spencer T.E. Onate S.A. Jenster G. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 141-164PubMed Google Scholar). The human co-activator CBP/p300 (3Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), the yeast SAGA complex (4Roberts S.M. Winston F. Genetics. 1997; 2: 451-465Crossref Google Scholar), and the human nuclear receptor co-repressors SMRT and N-CoR (5Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar) are among the best characterized examples of this growing protein family. Interestingly, some of these factors have dual function on specific promoters; for example CBP/p300, which mediates activation of interferon β gene expression in response to virus induction is also responsible for post-induction turn off (35Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K. Chen G. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two physically associated proteins, Cyc8(Ssn6) and Tup1, inhibit the transcription of many diversely regulated genes when their expression is not required (6Williams F.E. Varanasi U. Trumbly R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3307-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Keleher C.A. Redd M.J. Schultz J. Carlson M. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 8Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). It is well established that Cyc8-Tup1 acts as a co-repressor complex that does not bind DNA directly but is recruited to different promoters via interactions with specific DNA-binding regulatory proteins. The repression function of the complex is performed by a specific domain of Tup1 (8Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). When the Tup1 repression domain is brought upstream of an active test promoter through the DNA binding domain of LexA, it inhibits transcription independently of Cyc8. Moreover, this domain is required for repression of natural genes such as glucose, oxygen, and cell-type regulated genes. It has been postulated that multiple mechanisms are responsible for Tup1 repression. Tup1 interacts with histones H3 and H4 and may position nucleosomes over the transcription start point, suggesting that Tup1 might repress transcription by modifying chromatin structure (9Roth S.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). However, evidence from other studies argue that Tup1 inhibits the function of the basic transcription machinery; Tup1 repression was reconstituted in an in vitro transcription system in the absence of chromatin (11Herschbach B.M. Arnaud M.B. Johnson D.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and mutations in specific components of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex, such as the mediator proteins Sin4, Rgr1, Srb10, and Srb11, weaken the Tup1 repression activity (12Sakai A. Shimizu Y. Kondou S. Chibazakura T. Hishinuma F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4130-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Li Y. Bjorklund S. Jiang Y.W. Kim Y.J. Lane W.S. Stillman D.J.

Previous studies suggested that Cyc8 does not directly inhibit transcription but contacts specific DNA-binding regulatory proteins (8Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar,18Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of Cyc8 consists of 10 tandem repeats of a sequence motif termed tetratrico peptide repeat (TPR)1 (16Schultz J. Marshall-Carlson L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4744-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). TPRs serve as protein-protein interaction domains, and more importantly in the case of Cyc8, TPRs exhibit distinct interaction specificity although they are similar in primary structure (17Smith R.L. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 20Das K.A. Cohen T.P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). TPR1, TPR2, and TPR3 contact Tup1, while different combinations of TPR4 to TPR10 mediate recruitment of Cyc8-Tup1 to different promoters (18Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Based on these observations it was proposed that the function of Cyc8 is to link Tup1 to distinct, structurally dissimilar, DNA-bound repressor proteins. Consistently with this linker function, derivatives of Cyc8 that contain only the TPR domain are sufficient for repression. On the other hand, the C-terminal domain which comprises more than half of the protein appears to be dispensable (16Schultz J. Marshall-Carlson L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4744-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Smith R.L. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Recent genetic data suggested that Cyc8-Tup1 might also play a positive role in transcriptional control. More specifically, activation of theCYC1 gene transcription by the Hap1 transactivator and maximal induction of SUC2 gene both require functional Cyc8 protein (26Zhang L. Guarente L. Genetics. 1994; 136: 813-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ozcan S. Vallier L.G. Flick J.S. Carlson M. Johnston M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this report, we present direct evidence that Cyc8-Tup1 indeed plays diverse roles in transcriptional regulation. Expression of Cyc8-Tup1 repressible genes is stimulated in response to specific signals, and under these conditions, the fate of the Cyc8-Tup1 co-repressor has been unclear for most of the cases. Our data suggest that this complex can convert to a co-activator of CIT2, a gene encoding a peroxisomal isoform of citrate synthase that is expressed upon inducing conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction (21Lewin A.S. Hines V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We show that Cyc8-Tup1 is tethered to the CIT2 promoter by interacting with Rtg3, a DNA-binding transactivator of CIT2. Genetic analysis indicates that basal (uninduced) expression ofCIT2 is inhibited by Tup1, but its transcriptional activation is mediated by the second component of the complex, the Cyc8 subunit and specifically requires the C-terminal domain of this protein. The transcriptional activity of Cyc8 was further examined using a synthetic reporter promoter and a LexA-Cyc8 hybrid. Previous studies have shown that LexA-Cyc8 represses transcription by recruiting the Tup1 repressor (18Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Here we show that LexA-Cyc8 can activate transcription when Tup1 is absent or when the Tup1 repression is substantially impaired, as it is in a sin4Δ or argr1Δ mutant strain. Taken together, these data suggest an inherent potential of the Cyc8-Tup1 co-repressor for transcriptional activation function and establish a dual role (positive and negative) of this complex in transcriptional control.

We found that besides the well established repression activity, which is performed by Tup1, the Cyc8-Tup1 protein complex can also act as a transcriptional co-activator, and this function is predominantly mediated by the Cyc8 protein. When the Tup1 repression activity is impaired, as it is in asin4 or a rgr1 mutant strain, Cyc8-Tup1 activates an artificial reporter gene, and in response to specific metabolic signals, activates the transcription of the natural CIT2gene. Transcription of CIT2 is controlled by Rtg3 and Rtg1, both members of the bHLH/Zip family of DNA-binding proteins. Recombinant Rtg3 and Rtg1 bind as a heterodimer at two sites within an upstream activation sequence of the CIT2 gene termed UASr(31Rothermel B.A. Shyjan A.W. Etheredge J.L. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Kos W. Kal A.J. van Wilpe S. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Heterologous promoters bearing a UASr respond to mitochondrial dysfunction in a Rtg1/Rtg3-dependent manner indicating that UASr is sufficient to mediateCIT2 regulation (30Liao X.S. Small W.C. Srere P.A. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Notably, EMSAs using whole yeast extracts (instead of recombinant Rtg1 and Rtg3 proteins) suggested that additional yeast proteins, probably co-activators or co-repressors, associate with the DNA-bound Rtg1-Rtg3 heterodimer (29Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our results show that Cyc8 and Tup1 are indeed components of this UASr-bound protein complex. The Cyc8-Tup1 complex associates with Rtg3 in vivo and in vitro, and a DNA fragment encompassing two Rtg3/Rtg1-binding sites (UASr) gives rise to a stable protein-DNA complex, the formation of which is dependent on the presence of the Cyc8 TPR domain. Consistently, Rtg3 interaction is mediated by two specific TPR regions of Cyc8, TPR4 to TPR7 and TPR8 to TPR10. A third separate region, TPR1 to TPR3, associates with Tup1 (18Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 33Carrico P.M. Zitomer R.S. Genetics. 1998; 148: 637-644PubMed Google Scholar) explaining how tandem TPRs can link different proteins and assemble multiprotein complexes. Based on these observations, we propose that recruitment of Cyc8-Tup1 to theCIT2 promoter is mediated by specific TPRs that are responsible for linkage of Cyc8 to Tup1 and of that complex to the Rtg1/Rtg3 heterodimer. Several lines of evidence suggest that Cyc8-Tup1 is directly involved in the activation of CIT2 transcription and that this function is performed by the Cyc8 subunit. First, Cyc8-Tup1 specifically associates with the activation domain of Rtg3. This region of Rtg3 has been shown to be the major activation domain of the Rtg1/Rtg3 heterodimer because Rtg1, which does not possess independent transactivation properties, functions to recruit Rtg3 to its binding site (28Rothermel B.A. Thornton J.L. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19801-19807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, a possible role of the Rtg1/Rtg3 activation domain is to simply contact the Cyc8-Tup1 complex. Second, deletion ofCYC8 or deletion of both CYC8 and TUP1(data not shown) severely reduces the levels of CIT2mRNA under inducing conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction. Under these conditions, CIT2 transcription is defective even in the presence of Cyc8 derivatives (N300 and N597) that fully complement all known cyc8Δ-specific phenotypes, including slow growth and temperature-sensitive lethality (18Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These results suggest that lower CIT2 transcription is not an indirect physiological effect of the cyc8Δ mutation. In agreement to this, deletion of TUP1, which causes similar pleiotropic defects as cyc8Δ, does not significantly affect the levels ofCIT2 mRNA under inducing conditions. Third, when brought to a LexA operator-containing reporter, LexA-Cyc8 activates transcription in a tup1Δ strain. Similarly, the LexA-Cyc8/Tup1 protein complex activates transcription in an isogenicsin4Δ or a rgr1Δ strain that lacks the respective factor essential for Tup1 repression. These data, together with previous observations (26Zhang L. Guarente L. Genetics. 1994; 136: 813-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ozcan S. Vallier L.G. Flick J.S. Carlson M. Johnston M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), establish a positive role of Cyc8 in transcription and moreover they suggest a dual, positive and negative, function of the Cyc8-Tup1 protein complex on CIT2. Indeed Cyc8-Tup1 inhibits the basal (uninduced) expression ofCIT2, and this function is performed by Tup1.CIT2 transcription is derepressed in cells carrying thetup1Δ mutation while in cells that express Tup1, but lack Sin4 or Rgr1, CIT2 derepression occurs at even higher levels. This observation further suggests that Cyc8 activation function is better performed in the context of the Cyc8-Tup1 protein complex. Our data indicate that CIT2 transcription requires the C-terminal domain of Cyc8, and in fact, this is the only case that a function has been assigned to this region. When bound upstream of a test promoter through a heterologous DNA-binding domain this C-terminal region of Cyc8 does not activate transcription (data not shown); therefore it does not function as a typical activation domain, but rather plays a regulatory role. Cyc8 is a phosphoprotein, and specific regions within this C-terminal domain, rich in serine and threonine residues, are potential phosphorylation sites (16Schultz J. Marshall-Carlson L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4744-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similarly, Rtg3 contains a serine/threonine-rich region which might also play a regulatory role (28Rothermel B.A. Thornton J.L. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19801-19807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that specific modifications of these protein domains, such as phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, may in fact modulate the transcriptional activity of Cyc8-Tup1. Some of these modifications, particularly in the C-terminal domain of Cyc8, are likely to be specific for the retrograde response of CIT2 as this domain is dispensable for the regulation of all other Cyc8-Tup1 repressible genes. The signal(s) that mediate induction of peroxisomal genes upon mitochondrial dysfunction are presently unknown, and although several possible models can be envisaged using the available data, the molecular mechanism by which Cyc8-Tup1 is converted from a co-repressor to a co-activator of CIT2 is not yet understood. One model predicts that, upon induction, Tup1 dissociates from the complex thus unmasking Cyc8 activation potential. However, EMSAs performed with protein extracts derived from either normal or mitochondria defective cells detect neither quantitative nor qualitative differences on UASr DNA-protein complexes (21Lewin A.S. Hines V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,29Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). 4R. S. Conlan and D. Tzamarias, unpublished observations. This observation also argues against the model according to which additional positive regulatory factors associate with Rtg3/1-bound Cyc8-Tup1 assembling an activator complex, although transient interactions with such factors cannot be excluded. Another, more plausible, model postulates that in response to specific signaling, Cyc8-Tup1 undergoes post-translational modifications which could reveal the intrinsic activation potential of Cyc8. Masking of Tup1 repression, although possible, cannot solely account for the activation function of the complex because Cyc8-mediated CIT2 induction is observed even in the absence of Tup1 (tup1Δ strain, Fig. 4 A). Regulatory mechanisms by which proteins undergo conformational changes and activate transcription have been previously reported, and in some cases, as that of the retinoic acid receptor, these mechanisms have been characterized extensively (34Westin S. Kurokawa R. Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Mclnerney E.M. Rose D.W. Milburn M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 395: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that Cyc8 undergoes specific structural changes, i.e. by phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain, which is specifically required for stimulation of CIT2 transcription, and this could possibly be the key step through which the complex attains its activation potential. It must be emphasized that according to this model post-translational modifications of Cyc8 and probably of Tup1 have such an effect only when the complex is associated with the Rtg3/1 proteins. This hypothesis explains why Cyc8-Tup1 has a dual function only in CIT2 expression and why DNA-bound LexA-Cyc8/Tup1 is not converted to an activator of a synthetic reporter under inducing conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction (data not shown). Finally, it is known that Cyc8-Tup1 functionally interacts with the basic transcription machinery as well as with chromatin (15Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); thus it is conceivable that Cyc8 might activate CIT2 transcription by affecting either one or even both processes.

Sln1p also regulates the activity of a Hog1p-independent pathway whose transcriptional output can be monitored using an Mcm1p-dependent lacZreporter gene.

Yeast cells maintain elaborate mechanisms for adaptation and growth under a variety of adverse environmental conditions. For example, an increase in the osmolarity of the medium elicits an osmotic stress response that includes transient cell cycle arrest, restructuring of the actin cytoskeleton, and an elevation in the intracellular glycerol concentration (1Mager W.H.

Glycerol is produced intracellularly to partially offset the rise in external osmolarity thus preventing water loss that would lead to dehydration and eventual death (5Blomberg A.

Although the exact mechanism by which cells sense a change in osmotic pressure is not known, components of the intracellular signaling pathway that responds to osmotic stress response have begun to be elucidated (10Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 11Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the response to osmotic stress is mediated, in part, by the Hog1p MAP1kinase pathway (10Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Two membrane-associated osmosensors, Sln1p and Sho1p, regulate the activity of the Hog1p pathway, although the mechanism by which they do so differs (11Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Sho1p associates with and activates the Ste11p MEK kinase which phosphorylates the Pbs2p MEK, which in turn activates the MAP kinase Hog1p (10Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 12Posas F. Saito H. Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Sln1p, on the other hand, is a yeast homolog of “two-component” regulators prominent in bacterial signal transduction (13Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The two-component designation refers to the two modules, a sensor/transmitter (histidine kinase) and a response regulator (receiver plus output) module that comprise the basic signaling unit. Two-component signal transduction involves autophosphorylation of the transmitter module on a histidine residue followed by phosphotransfer to an aspartate residue of the receiver module (14Stock J.B. Stock A.M. Mottonen J.M. Nature. 1990; 344: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Sln1p controls the activity of the Hog1p MAP kinase pathway via a phosphorelay system involving Ypd1p (a phosphorelay intermediate) and Ssk1p (a response regulator with an output domain). The dephosphorylated form of the Ssk1p response regulator activates the MEK kinases, Ssk2p and Ssk22p which then activate the Pbs2p MEK and Hog1p MAP kinase (11Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 15Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 16Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Hog1p is thought to phosphorylate transcription factors responsible for turning on a family of osmoresponse genes that includes glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1) which is involved in the synthesis of glycerol (8Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that Sln1p also regulates the activity of a Hog1p-independent pathway whose transcriptional output can be monitored using a lacZ reporter gene we call P-lacZ, which consists of a CYC1-lacZ fusion in which the UAS of CYC1 has been replaced by a palindromic-binding site (P site) for the Mcm1p transcription factor (17Fassler J.S.

Potential and known target genes of Mcm1p encode proteins involved in cell type determination, cell wall and membrane integrity, cellular metabolism, and cell cycle progression (19Kuo M.H. Grayhack E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 348-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Null mutations in SLN1decrease P-lacZ reporter gene expression whereas activator mutations in the gene (sln1*) increase P-lacZreporter gene expression. As is the case for the HOG pathway, Sln1p control of the P-lacZ reporter appears to require the kinase and phosphotransfer functions of Sln1p (17Fassler J.S. Gray W.M. Malone C.L. Tao W. Lin H. Deschenes R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13365-13371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The sln1*mutations that result in increased P-lacZ reporter gene activity map to positions likely to affect phosphorylation. More compelling evidence for the role of phosphorylation and phosphotransfer in sln1* activation of the P-lacZ reporter comes from the osmosensitive phenotype of these mutants which is a reflection of reduced HOG pathway activity (17Fassler J.S. Gray W.M. Malone C.L. Tao W. Lin H. Deschenes R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13365-13371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The demonstration of a second pathway controlled by Sln1p led us to propose that the Sln1p osmosensor sends two signals in response to changes in osmolarity. Activation of Hog1p accounts for the increase in glycerol, whereas changes in Mcm1p activity might account for changes in parameters of cell growth (e.g. cell cycle progression, cell wall composition, and expansion) that are postulated to occur in response to osmotic stress. In their natural environment, yeast are exposed not only to increased osmolarity but also to decreased osmolarity. Cellular adjustment to decreased osmolarity involves a protein kinase C-like protein (PKC) encoded by the PKC1 gene (20Levin D.E. Fields F.O. Kunisawa R. Bishop J.M. Thorner J. Cell. 1990; 62: 213-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) which regulates a MAP kinase cascade consisting of the BCK1 MEK kinase (21Costigan C. Gehrung S. Snyder M. Mol. Cell.

Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In contrast to HOG pathway mutants which fail to grow under high osmolarity conditions, mutants lacking PKC pathway function exhibit cell lysis at low osmolarity (26Levin D.E. Bartlett-Heubusch E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The cell lysis phenotype and corresponding reduction in β-glucan content in the cell walls of pkc1 mutants (27Shimizu J. Yoda K. Yamasaki M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) indicates that the PKC pathway is required, in part, for cell wall integrity. Consistent with the idea that the PKC kinase cascade is an osmosensory system required for growth under low osmolarity, Davenport et al. (28Davenport K.R. Sohaskey M. Kamada Y. Levin D.E. Gustin M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30157-30161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) have shown that Mpk1p is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to hypo-osmotic conditions. Interestingly, the Hog1 and Mpk1 pathways appear to cross-talk; tyrosine phosphorylation of Mpk1 was inhibited in cells exposed to an elevated osmotic environment. Although there is now a considerable body of information about the pathways that lead to changes in gene expression and adaptation to osmotic stress environments, the mechanism by which osmotic stress is sensed remains obscure. To further investigate the signals and molecules involved in modulating Sln1 activity, we have undertaken a genetic screen to find new mutations that mimic the effect ofsln1* mutations in elevating the activity of the P-lacZ reporter gene. We report here the isolation of loss of function mutations in FPS1, a gene encoding a major glycerol transporter of the cell. Mutations in FPS1 are known to reduce glycerol efflux resulting in increased intracellular glycerol levels, thus disturbing normal osmotic balance (29Luyten K. Albertyn J. Skibbe W.F. Prior B.A. Ramos J. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The identification of Fps1p as a regulator of a Sln1p pathway activity suggests that the Sln1 protein may generally detect and respond to deviations from the normal osmotic gradient and may not specifically bind or sense external osmolytes. All yeast strains used in this work (Table I) are from our strain collection or were constructed for this study. The fps1 deletion was introduced by one-step transformation (30Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar) using the 4.9-kbBamHI-HindIII fragment from pWT1040. The replacement was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis ofBamHI-HindIII digested genomic DNA using the 2.5-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment from theFPS1 gene as a probe. Conversion of the LEU2 gene disruption marker to kan R in various strains was accomplished as described previously (31Guldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Kan replacements were confirmed on the basis of the newly gained Leu− and G418 resistance phenotypes.

Open table in a new tab Conversion of the SLN1 + allele tosln1–22 was accomplished by two-step replacement (32Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Plasmid pWT980 which carries the sln1–22 allele was linearized within the SLN1 sequences using NruI. Ura+ transformants in which the plasmid was integrated at the SLN1 locus were then subject to selection on 5-fluoroorotic acid to isolate recombinants containing only thesln1–22 allele. The presence of the sln1–22allele was confirmed by sequence analysis (primer: 5′-AGAATGTTGAACTTGGAGGGC-3′) of a 0.5-kb polymerase chain reaction product generated from yeast genomic DNA template (primers: SLN1 3200 (5′-GCCACATCAAGTTGAGAATTCCCCACAGTCAAAGACG-3′) and SLN1 4119 (5′- CGCGCAAGCTTTTGATTTCTC-3′)). Integration of the P-lacZ reporter was accomplished by linearizing the P-lacZ integrating vector, pGY88 withinURA3 using ApaI, and transforming the strain to Ura+. Successful integration at the URA3 locus and the number of plasmids integrated in each strain was examined by Southern analysis of PstI digested DNA. A 1-kblacZ polymerase chain reaction product (primers: lacZ 280F (5′-CGGTTACGATGCGCCCATCTACACC-3′) and lacZ 1291R (5′-GGATCATCGGTCAGACGATTCATTGG -3′)) was used for probe synthesis. The presence of multiple copies of the reporter was revealed by hybridization of the probe to a novel 7-kb PstI fragment. The media were prepared as described by Sherman et al. (33Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 163-167Google Scholar) and included synthetic complete medium (SC) lacking one or more specific amino acids (e.g. SC-uracil) and rich medium (YPD). Plates for the detection of β-galactosidase contained 50 mg of 5-bromo-4-chlor-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal)/ml and were prepared as described by Larson et al. (34Larson G.P. Itakura K. Ito H. Rossi J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 22: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmids pGY48 (35Yu G. Fassler J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and pBG12 (TEF2lacZ) (36Gray W.M. Fassler J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were previously described. The integrating derivative of pGY48, pGY88, was constructed by deleting a 2.2-kbEcoRI fragment containing the 2-μm origin. TheCYC1-lacZ reporter is pLG669Z (37Guarente L. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2199-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and the ΔUAS-lacZ reporter is pLG670Z, a derivative of pLG669Z which lacks the XhoI fragment encompassing the CYC1 UAS. Additional P site-dependent reporters included pJF947 (1xP), pCM771 (4xP), and pCM772 (4xmutP). The P site and mut P site oligonucleotides used in construction of these reporters were as follows: 5′-TCGAGTTTCCTAATTAGGAAAC-3′ (P) and 5′-TCGAGTTTCCTAATTAATAAAC-3′ plus 5′-TCGAGTTTATTAATTAGGAAAC-3′ (mutP).LEU2 CEN plasmids used in the genetic screen for new nrp mutants included SLN1 (pGY111) (18Yu G. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), GAL11(pJF765) (35Yu G. Fassler J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and KEX2 (pSBKX, R. Fuller). pGY107 is a 2-μm plasmid containing an MCM1 gene with a Myc epitope tag. The Myc epitope was inserted into a newEcoRV site that was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis between amino acids 3 and 4 of the cloned MCM1 gene. The Myc epitope was encoded by complementary 30-base pair oligonucleotides which were annealed to generate a blunt end fragment for cloning into the EcoRV site. The presence and orientation of Myc sequences was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The modifiedMCM1 gene was then subcloned as a 3.5-kbXbaI-XhoI fragment into pRS316 (URA3,CEN) (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid complemented the α-halo defect of an mcm1-1 mutant. pWT1037 consists of a 2.6-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment containing FPS1 cloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the LEU2 CEN vector, pRS315 (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pWT1039 consists of a 2.8-kb HindIII-EcoRI fragment containing SDH2 and YLL042C cloned into theHindIII and EcoRI sites of pRS315. pWT1040 is a derivative of pWT1037 from which an internal 0.9-kbXhoI-PstI fragment was deleted and replaced with a 3.3-kb XhoI-PstI LEU2 fragment excised from plasmid YEp13. pJF1070 is a LEU2 marked disruption of the GPD1gene. A GPD1 fragment encompassing the entire open reading frame was polymerase chain reaction amplified using a primer pair corresponding to open reading frame YDL022W (Research Genetics) and genomic DNA as template. A 1.9-kb AvaI-BamHI restriction fragment was cloned into pUC19 (Promega Biotech) to generate the intermediate plasmid, pJF1068. A deletion of 268 base pairs was introduced into the GPD1 open reading frame on pJF1068 by SalI digestion and ligation. A 2.2-kbSalI-XhoI LEU2 fragment was subsequently ligated into the SalI site to create pJF1070. pWT250 is a derivative of pRS424 (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a 2-μm TRP1 marked plasmid into which was cloned a 5-kb EcoRI fragment containing the GPD1 gene isolated from YEpGPD1 (8Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Plasmid pWT980 used in converting SLN1 + strains tosln1–22 consists of a 2.1-kbEagI-XbaI fragment containing thesln1–22 alteration cloned into pRS406 URA3integrating vector. A kar1 (JF1593 or JF1595) strain carrying the plasmid to be introduced was mated to candidate mutants (which also carry two recessive drug resistance alleles). Cytoductants were selected on drug plates (selecting for the persistence of thenrp nucleus and loss of the kar1 nucleus) lacking leucine (selecting for the presence of the plasmid) and tested for their X-gal phenotype. The starting strain, JF1567 was subject to ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis (18Yu G. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) sufficient to cause 65% killing. Approximately 54,600 surviving colonies were screened on X-gal plates to find 550 mutants with increased blue color. Mutants were crossed by a wild type strain of the opposite mating type and diploids tested for their X-gal phenotype. Fifty diploids out of 550 exhibited a mutant (blue phenotype) and were thus put aside on the basis of the dominance of the mutation. SLN1 and GAL11 plasmids were introduced into each of the 500 remaining mutants by a cytoduction strategy (see “Results”). Nine were complemented by theSLN1 plasmid, and 22 were complemented by theGAL11 plasmid. From previous studies we were aware that mutations in the KEX2 gene also (nonspecifically) increase the color of reporter bearing strains on X-gal plates. Mutations in theKEX2 gene were in fact the major class in the preliminary screen that resulted in three sln1* alleles. Consequently, we also introduced a KEX2 plasmid into each mutant. Three hundred mutants were complemented by the KEX2 plasmid or by more than one plasmid. One hundred forty-two mutants could not be complemented by any of the three plasmids. Each of the remaining mutants was tested for its P site specificity. The P-lacZreporter was first eliminated from each strain by selection on 5-fluoroorotic acid plates and then a TEF2-lacZreporter introduced. Each strain was examined on X-gal media and cultured for quantitation of β-galactosidase levels in liquid assays. Twelve mutants exhibited a 2-fold or greater increase in P-lacZ activity but less than a 2-fold increase inTEF2-lacZ reporter activity. Cells were cultured in YPD or SC media overnight. Approximately 8 × 107 cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with water. Cells were resuspended in sporulation medium (1% potassium acetate and 10 μg/ml amino acids required by the strain). Sporulation cultures were incubated with aeration at room temperature for 5–8 days. Cells were grown to a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml at 30 °C in the designated media. Sorbitol (Fluka) was added to log phase cultures to a final concentration of 1.0 m as follows. A 5.0m sorbitol stock was first added to conditioned YPD to a final concentration of 2.0 m. YPD cultures grown to 1 × 107 cells/ml were then diluted 1:1 with the 2.0m conditioned YPD/sorbitol to a final concentration of 1.0m sorbitol. Preparation of RNA, electrophoresis, blotting, and hybridization were performed as described previously (18Yu G. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8739-8743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).32P-Labeled probes were prepared using random primers (39Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar,40Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5193) Google Scholar). Quantitation was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were harvested in exponential growth. Extracts were prepared using a previously described trichloroacetic acid extraction (41Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%; 4.5% stacking gel), transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blot was probed with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (1:1000 dilution). Immune complexes were visualized by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) Intracellular glycerol was assayed enzymatically with a commercial glycerol determination kit (Boehringer-Mannheim Biochemicals). Extracts were prepared essentially as described (42Philips J. Herskowitz I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to log phase in selective media. Three 10-ml aliquots were separately filtered onto 0.45-μm cellulose nitrate filters (Whatman), washed with 5 ml of cold YPD, and resuspended in 2 ml 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. One-ml samples were heated to 95 °C for 10 min and cell debris pelleted by low-speed centrifugation. Pooled aliquots were used in determining glycerol levels according to manufacturer's specifications. Protein extracts were prepared from the remaining cells. Cells were vortexed four times (30 s each) in the presence of glass beads and cell debris pelleted by high speed centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Glycerol concentrations were normalized to total protein. Fold increase in glycerol concentration was determined by normalizing to the glycerol concentration in wild type cells. Data represent the average of six trials using a minimum of three transformants. A strain carrying theMCM1-dependent reporter, P-lacZexhibits a pale blue phenotype on plates containing the chromogenic substrate, X-gal (50 mg/liter). Previously, we have described recessive alleles of SLN1 (nrp2-1, nrp2-2, andnrp2-3; renamed sln1–21, 22, and 23) and GAL11 that exhibi"

https://openalex.org/W2068134425,"In plants, Ser is synthesized through a couple of pathways. 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH), the first enzyme that is involved in the phosphorylated pathway of Ser biosynthesis, is responsible for the oxidation of 3-phosphoglycerate to phosphohydroxypyruvate. Here we report the first molecular cloning and characterization of PGDH from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Sequence analysis of cDNA and a genomic clone revealed that the PGDH gene is composed of three exons, encoding a 623-amino acid polypeptide (66,453 Da). The deduced protein, containing three of the most conserved regions in the NAD-dependent 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family, has 38–39% identity to its animal and bacterial counterparts. The presence of an N-terminal signal sequence for translocation into plastids was confirmed by particle-gun bombardment experiments using green fluorescence protein as a reporter protein for subcellular localization. Southern hybridization analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping indicated that PGDH is a single-copy gene that is mapped to the upper arm of chromosome 1. Northern hybridization analysis indicated preferential expression of PGDH mRNA in root tissues of light-grown plants, suggesting that the phosphorylated pathway of Ser biosynthesis plays an important role in supplying Ser to non-photosynthetic tissues. The recombinant enzyme overproduced in <i>Escherichia coli</i> displayed hyperbolic kinetics with respect to 3-phosphoglycerate and NAD<sup>+</sup>."

Studies on mice with a null mutation in the GnT I gene have indicated that N-glycans play critical roles in mammalian morphogenesis. This paper presents studies on N-glycans during the development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We have cloned cDNAs for three predicted C. elegans genes homologous to mammalian GnT I (designatedgly-12, gly-13, and gly-14). All three cDNAs encode proteins (467, 449, and 437 amino acids, respectively) with the domain structure typical of previously cloned Golgi-type glycosyltransferases. Expression in both insect cells and transgenic worms showed that gly-12 and gly-14, but not gly-13, encode active GnT I. All three genes were expressed throughout worm development (embryo, larval stages L1–L4, and adult worms). The gly-12 and gly-13promoters were expressed from embryogenesis to adulthood in many tissues. The gly-14 promoter was expressed only in gut cells from L1 to adult developmental stages. Transgenic worms that overexpress any one of the three genes show no obvious phenotypic defects. The data indicate that C. elegans is a suitable model for further study of the role of complex N-glycans in development.

Recent work on mice and humans in which the synthesis of complex N-glycans is defective has provided excellent evidence that these structures play essential roles in development. Although somatic Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants lacking the GnT I gene show essentially normal growth, mouse embryos with a null mutation in this gene do not survive beyond 10.5 days postfertilization and show severe developmental abnormalities particularly of the brain (3Metzler M.

Mice with a homozygous null mutation in the gene encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:α-6-d-mannoside β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GnT II) survive to term but are born stunted with various congenital abnormalities and die shortly after birth (5Campbell R.

Carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome (CDGS) is a group of congenital diseases in which there is a defect in protein N-glycosylation (6Jaeken J. Carchon H. Stibler H. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Children with CDGS types 1 and 2 show severe psychomotor retardation and other multisystemic abnormalities. About 80% of CDGS type 1 children have a defect in the phosphomannomutase gene (7Van Schaftingen E. Jaeken J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 8Jaeken J.

The data indicate that complex N-glycans appeared in evolution just prior to the appearance of multicellular organisms and that, at least in mammals, they play important roles in the interactions between a cell and its cellular and fluid environment. Because of the complexities encountered in the study of mammalian development, we have initiated studies on the role of complexN-glycans in the development of a simpler organism, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Over 80% of theC. elegans genome has been sequenced, and detailed information is available on the morphology, development, and physiology of this worm. The GnT I gene (MGAT1) has been cloned from several mammalian and nonmammalian species (38Sarkar M. Pagny S. Unligil U. Joziasse D. Mucha J. Glossl J. Schachter H. Glycoconj.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Pharmacia DNA synthesizer and purified by the cartridge method (Hospital for Sick Children-Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Center, Toronto, Canada). All cDNAs and DNA constructs were sequenced in both directions by the double strand dideoxy method (48Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to prepare threegly-13 gene-specific probes (based on the genomic sequence; GenBankTM accession number U23516), as follows (see Table Ifor PCR primer sequences): probe A (142 nt), primers CEBF1 and CEBR2; probe B (145 nt), primers CEBF3 and CEBR4; probe C (168 nt), primers CEBF5 and CEBR6. PCR products were purified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 3000 Ci/mmol) using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech “Ready To Go” DNA labeling kit. The labeled probes were purified using Sephadex G50 DNA grade nick columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An oligo(dT)-primed C. elegans cDNA library in λgt10 (provided by Drs. S. Kim and H. R. Horvitz, MIT) was screened with a mixture of probes A, B, and C. Positive plaques were rescreened with each probe individually. Only one plaque hybridized to all three probes, and it was purified for further analysis.Table IOligonucleotide primersGenePrimer NameExonRestriction EnzymePrimer sequencegly-12CEFF145′-CGTCACACAAGTCGCACAAAAG-3′CEFF25EcoRI5′-TGCGGAATTCTCAAAAAGCGGAACAACTACCCAG-3′CEFR314BamHI5′-CTGAGGATCCGTTGGAAACTGAAGAGAGCATTG-3′CEFR45, 65′-GTCGTCTTCAGTCACAATG-3′CEFF575′-GGGATGACTGGATGCGAAAGC-3′CEFR714EcoRI5′-GCCCGAATTCAACGAAAGCTAAACGGAAAGAATC-3′CEFR102NotI5′-ATTAGCGGCCGCATATCATCCTCATCTTCCCG-3′CEFR158EcoRI5′-GGGCGAATTCTATGCGACGTTCTACTGATT-3′CEFF-DEL7, 8EcoRI5′-GAGTGAATTCGGGATGACTGGATGCGAAAGCCAGAACACTACTGGGATGGAGAA-3′UnknownaUnknown gene upstream of gly-12, designated as F48E3.1a (see “Results”).CEFF81NotI5′-TATAGCGGCCGCATGAACCAGACCTTTGAACG-3′CEFF94NotI5′-TATAGCGGCCGCAATACGAACTCACACAAATCAA-3′CEFR115NotI5′-ATATGCGGCCGCTCTTCACACCTTTGCCTCAT-3′gly-13CEBF125′-ACGGATAATATTGATGATTTAC-3′CEBR225′-CTTCCATTATCACATGTTTTCC-3′CEBF395′-AAACGTGGCATGAACTAGAACC-3′CEBR495′-CTGGCGCCTTCTTTTCCATAAG-3′CEBF5125′-ATATTGACTACATCCGGAAAGC-3′CEBR6125′-CCGACCAATCTGGATTATATGC-3′CEBF14bThese primers were used to make PCR products for insertion into the baculovirus transfer vector (see “Materials and Methods”).2NotI5′-GCGTGCGGCCGCTTTACTGGAATCAGCGAATA-3′CEBR15bThese primers were used to make PCR products for insertion into the baculovirus transfer vector (see “Materials and Methods”).,cThese primers contain a STOP codon.12NotI5′-GCAAGCGGCCGCAAACTACTCTCCAAACGACG-3′gly-14CEMF1bThese primers were used to make PCR products for insertion into the baculovirus transfer vector (see “Materials and Methods”).1, 2NotI5′-TACTGCGGCCGCAATCGTAAAAGAGGAACTAAGG-3′CEMR225′-AATTCTCAGTCTCGTTGCTCTA-3′CEMR4bThese primers were used to make PCR products for insertion into the baculovirus transfer vector (see “Materials and Methods”).,cThese primers contain a STOP codon.12KpnI5′-GACGGCGGTACCTCACCAAGAAGAATCATAACCA-3′CEMR585′-GGCTCTCTCATCCAATCATCCCAG-3′CEMR68NotI5′-GAATGCGGCCGCCCAGAATCCATTCGGCCAAATTG-3′CEMF755′-GACTGCGACAATGAAAGCGTGAAG-3′CEMF85NotI5′-CATAGCGGCCGCATCCTCCAGGAGAAAGTGTGAA-3′CEMR105KpnI5′-TCGTGGTACCTATGATTCAACGCCAGCTTG-3′CEMR-DELcThese primers contain a STOP codon.10, 12SacI5′-GGCCGAGCTCTCACCAAGAAGAATCATAACCATCAATATCGACGGGAACAGCAT-3′AP15′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′AP25′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′SL1XhoI5′-GCCTCGAGGGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG-3′gly-12PRFF5SalI5′-GCTCGTCGACACAGCGATTTGGTATTGGAAC-3′PRFR6BamHI5′-AGCTGGATCCTCTTGGGCGTTGGTGGTCCTT-3′gly-13PRBF53SalI5′-TTACGTCGACTTACGATATTGGAGGAGTGC-3′PRBR1040BamHI5′-TTCTGGATCCGCATGCAAGATTTTAGGTGG-3′PRBF618SpeI5′-CGTGACTAGTGCGGTGACAAAAATCTTTAT-3′PRBR4027AlfII5′-GCTGCTTAAGTTTAGCTTTGCTTCTTGCCC-3′gly-14PRMF1158SpeI5′-GCATACTAGTTCACATTTATCTTCGTGCTC-3′PRMR4530AflII5′-CAGTCTTAAGGTAGAGATACAGTTGGAGTA-3′PRMF33SalI5′-ACCAGTCGACGCTTATAAACTTGGAGATGA-3′PRMR2664BamHI5′-TCGTGGATCCTATATGCGTGATTTTGGCTG-3′gly-12FEXF11NsiI5′-TTCCATGCATCGGGTGCTCCGTCG-3′FEXR212SacI5′-GCCTGAGCTCTAAACAACTAGCATCTCGC-3′gly-13BEXF11NheI5′-ATCTGCTAGCCTAAAATCATGCATGCGGTG-3′BEXR22EcoRV5′-GCCTGATATCCCTTCCTGTTTGCCCTTATT-3′gly-14MEXF11NheI5′-GCGTGCTAGCCAAAATCATGCATATATCATCG-3′MEXR2intron 4EcoRV5′-CTCGGATATCGTATGGAAGGGGGAAGGATG-3′SC#0015′-GTCGAGCTAGCCATGGCGGCCGAACAGAAG-3′SC#002NsiI5′-TTCTATGCATTCCTCCAACCGCCGCAGCATTAT-3′Restriction sites and point mutations of the ATG start codons are underlineda Unknown gene upstream of gly-12, designated as F48E3.1a (see “Results”).b These primers were used to make PCR products for insertion into the baculovirus transfer vector (see “Materials and Methods”).c These primers contain a STOP codon. Open table in a new tab Restriction sites and point mutations of the ATG start codons are underlined Since there is an EcoRI site in the open reading frame of gly-13 near the 3′-end, the full-lengthgly-13 cDNA was obtained by partial digestion of the λgt10 plaque DNA with EcoRI, subcloned into pGEM7Zf(+) (Promega), and sequenced. A partial cDNA was also produced by the RT-PCR/3′-RACE procedure (49Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar) using a preparation of C. elegans total RNA as template. An oligo(dT) primer was used for reverse transcription. A gene-specific forward primer (CEBF5, Table I) and a reverse adaptor primer (AP2) were used for 3′-RACE (Marathon cDNA amplification kit, CLONTECH). The gly-14 cDNA was cloned by an RT-PCR approach using the Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH) as recommended by the manufacturer. Adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of adult C. elegans total RNA followed by second strand synthesis and ligation of Marathon cDNA adaptor to both ends of the double-stranded cDNA. The Marathon cDNA adaptor has two primer binding sites: AP1 (outer) and AP2 (inner) (see Table I). PCR was then carried out three times in succession using the adaptor-ligated cDNA as template and the following primer pairs (Table I; gene-specific primers based on the genomic sequence, GenBankTM accession number Z46381): CEMR5-AP1 (once) followed by CEMF1-CEMR6 (twice). PCR was also carried out three times in succession using the following primer pairs (Table I): CEMF7-AP1 (once) followed by CEMF8-CEMR4 (twice). The PCR products could be visualized by ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels only after the third round of PCR. Fusion of the two PCR products was carried out by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the primer pair CEMF1-CEMR4 (Table I) to yield a cDNA fragment encoding the GLY-14 protein sequence containing the STOP codon but lacking 30 amino acids at the amino terminus, including the putative transmembrane domain. This truncated cDNA was subcloned into the NotI andKpnI sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pVT-Bac-His (kindly donated by Dr. David Joziasse, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam) (38Sarkar M. Pagny S. Unligil U. Joziasse D. Mucha J. Glossl J. Schachter H. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and sequenced. Some of the missing 5′-sequence ofgly-14 cDNA was obtained by PCR using the AP2-CEMR10 primer pair (Table I) and adaptor-ligated cDNA as template. Attempts to determine the remainder of the 3′-end of the cDNA by 3′-RACE were not successful. A 1.2-kb gly-12 hybridization probe was made by PCR using the Marathon adaptor-ligated C. elegans cDNA (described above) as template and primers CEFF2-CEFR3 (Table I; gene-specific primers based on the genomic sequence, GenBankTM accession number U28735). The C. elegans cDNA library was screened with this probe, as described above for gly-13. After three rounds of screening with the same probe, nine positive plaques were identified. Phage DNA from five of these plaques was prepared, and inserts were excised withEcoRI, subcloned into pGEM7Zf(+), and sequenced. A portion of the 3′-end of the gly-12 cDNA (88 nt) was obtained by PCR using adaptor-ligated cDNA as template and three successive PCR reactions with primer pairs CEFF1-AP1, CEFF2-AP2, and CEFF5-CEFR7, respectively (Table I). Attempts to determine the remainder of the 3′-end of the cDNA by 3′-RACE were not successful. Total cDNA was prepared by RT-PCR using as substrate total RNA prepared from the L2 larval stage. The following PCR reactions were carried out using this cDNA as template and the SL1 primer (TableI) as the forward primer and reverse primers as shown in Table I. PCR was carried out using CEFR15 as the reverse primer. The solution was reamplified using the nested primer CEFR4. A PCR product of the expected size was observed and further amplified with reverse primer CEFR10. PCR was carried out using CEBR4 as the reverse primer. A PCR product of the expected size was seen and reamplified with the nested primer CEBR2. A procedure similar to that used forgly-12 was carried out using CEMR6, CEMR10, and CEMR2, respectively, as reverse primers. The three final PCR products were sequenced and all three messages showed trans-splicing to SL1. C. elegans GnT I was expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system as described previously (38Sarkar M. Pagny S. Unligil U. Joziasse D. Mucha J. Glossl J. Schachter H. Glycoconj.

DNA fragments encoding truncated GLY-12, GLY-13, and GLY-14 GnT I proteins lacking the amino-terminal cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains and parts of the stem region were synthesized by PCR amplification using Vent DNA polymerase and GnT I cDNAs as templates (43, 39, and 31 amino acids were removed from the amino-terminal end, respectively). The primer pairs used forgly-13 and gly-14 are shown in Table I. The PCR products were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVT-Bac-His (38Sarkar M. Pagny S. Unligil U. Joziasse D. Mucha J.

J. 1998; 15: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) downstream from and in frame with the ATG start site of the plasmid using restriction enzyme sites introduced by the primers (Table I). This vector encodes a cleavable signal sequence for secretion from the Sf9 cells. Full-length gly-12 cDNA was excised from plasmid p78F-Myc (see below) and subcloned into pBlueBacHis C (Invitrogen) downstream from and in frame with the ATG start site of the plasmid to create a recombinant transfer vector encoding full-length GLY-12 (51Tan J.

Recombinant plasmids were sequenced and co-transfected with BaculoGold linearized baculovirus DNA (PharMingen) to produce recombinant baculovirus by homologous recombination in Sf9 cells (50Sarkar M. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus, and after 5–6 days, cells were sedimented and lysed in 0.5 ml of 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% sodium azide. Sf9 cell lysates and culture medium and worm lysates were assayed for GnT I activity using as acceptor substrate 0.5 mm Manα1–6(Manα1–3)Manβ-octyl (M3-octyl, kindly provided by Dr. Hans Paulsen, University of Hamburg) (50Sarkar M.

The assay mixture also contained 2.5 mm AMP, 50 mm GlcNAc, 20 mm MnCl2, 1 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 6.1, and 0.010 ml of enzyme in a 0.050-ml total volume (50Sarkar M. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Time of incubation was 0.5–1 h at 37 °C for all baculovirus/Sf9-expressed enzymes and at 26 °C for enzymes expressed in C. elegans. Kinetic parameters were determined on the recombinant rabbit (50Sarkar M. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) andC. elegans enzymes by a series of reciprocal velocity-substrate plots at four concentrations of both substrates (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm M3-octyl and 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08 mm UDP-GlcNAc) (50Sarkar M.

Kinetic analyses were also carried out using (Manα1–6(Manα1–3)Manα1–6)(Manα1–3)Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-Asn (M5-glycopeptide) (54Nishikawa Y. Pegg W. Paulsen H. Schachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8270-8281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as acceptor substrate (0.22, 0.44, 0.66, and 0.88 mm). Control GnT I assays were carried out with uninfected Sf9 cells and cells infected with wild type baculovirus. Metal requirements (20 mm divalent cation) and pH and temperature optima were determined. Protein content was measured by the BCA assay (Pierce). Total (∼20 μg) and poly(A)+ RNA (∼2.5 μg) from a mixed stage population of N2 hermaphrodites and total RNA from staged synchronous populations was subjected to Northern analysis by electrophoresis in a denaturing 1.0% agarose gel (10% formaldehyde) (55Yip B. Chen S.H. Mulder H. Hoppener J.W.M. Schachter H. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). DNA size markers were prepared by digestion of λ phage DNA (5 μg) with EcoRI and HindIII; DNA fragments were end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and Klenow DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Probes for gly-12 (126–1504 nt relative to the ATG start codon at +1) and gly-13 (114–1350 nt relative to the ATG start codon at +1) were made by excision of the truncatedgly-12 and gly-13 inserts from the respective recombinant baculovirus transfer vectors (see above). Probes were randomly labeled with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). After hybridization of Northern blots with these probes (1 × 107 cpm/ml for gly-12and 3.2 × 106 cpm/ml for gly-13), the blots were stripped with 0.1% SDS at 100 °C and reprobed with a32P-labeled probe for the fem-1 gene (1–2 × 106 cpm/ml) as a sample loading control (56Gaudet J. Van der Elst I. Spence A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1107-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We were able to detect gly-14 mRNA only by RT-PCR, not by Northern blot analysis, suggesting thatgly-14 is expressed at lower levels than gly-12and gly-13. We used competitive quantitative RT-PCR to estimate the relative abundance of both gly-12 andgly-14 mRNA during development. Total cDNA was obtained by oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription of total RNA from all six developmental stages in the presence of 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Advantage"
https://openalex.org/W1987056502,"Cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which utilize the well studied JAK/STAT pathway for nuclear signal transduction, are themselves translocated to the nucleus. The exact mechanism for the nuclear import of IFN-γ or the functional role of the nuclear translocation of ligand in signal transduction is unknown. We show in this study that nuclear localization of IFN-γ is driven by a simple polybasic nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in its COOH terminus, as verified by its ability to specify nuclear import of a heterologous protein allophycocyanin (APC) in standard import assays in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Similar to other nuclear import signals, we show that a peptide representing amino acids 95–132 of IFN-γ (IFN-γ(95–132)) containing the polybasic sequence126RKRKRSR132 was capable of specifying nuclear uptake of the autofluorescent protein, APC, in an energy-dependent fashion that required both ATP and GTP. Nuclear import was abolished when the above polybasic sequence was deleted. Moreover, deletions immediately NH2-terminal of this sequence did not affect the nuclear import. Thus, the sequence126RKRKRSR132 is necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. Furthermore, nuclear import was strongly blocked by competition with the cognate peptide IFN-γ(95–132) but not the peptide IFN-γ(95–125), which is deleted in the polybasic sequence, further confirming that the NLS properties were contained in this sequence. A peptide containing the prototypical polybasic NLS sequence of the SV40 large T-antigen was also able to inhibit the nuclear import mediated by IFN-γ(95–132). This observation suggests that the NLS in IFN-γ may function through the components of the Ran/importin pathway utilized by the SV40 T-NLS. Finally, we show that intact IFN-γ, when coupled to APC, was also able to mediate its nuclear import. Again, nuclear import was blocked by the peptide IFN-γ(95–132) and the SV40 T-NLS peptide, suggesting that intact IFN-γ was also transported into the nucleus through the Ran/importin pathway. Previous studies have suggested a direct intracellular role for IFN-γ in the induction of its biological activities. Based on our data in this study, we suggest that a key intracellular site of interaction of IFN-γ is the one with the nuclear transport mechanism that occurs via the NLS in the COOH terminus of IFN-γ. Cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which utilize the well studied JAK/STAT pathway for nuclear signal transduction, are themselves translocated to the nucleus. The exact mechanism for the nuclear import of IFN-γ or the functional role of the nuclear translocation of ligand in signal transduction is unknown. We show in this study that nuclear localization of IFN-γ is driven by a simple polybasic nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in its COOH terminus, as verified by its ability to specify nuclear import of a heterologous protein allophycocyanin (APC) in standard import assays in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Similar to other nuclear import signals, we show that a peptide representing amino acids 95–132 of IFN-γ (IFN-γ(95–132)) containing the polybasic sequence126RKRKRSR132 was capable of specifying nuclear uptake of the autofluorescent protein, APC, in an energy-dependent fashion that required both ATP and GTP. Nuclear import was abolished when the above polybasic sequence was deleted. Moreover, deletions immediately NH2-terminal of this sequence did not affect the nuclear import. Thus, the sequence126RKRKRSR132 is necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. Furthermore, nuclear import was strongly blocked by competition with the cognate peptide IFN-γ(95–132) but not the peptide IFN-γ(95–125), which is deleted in the polybasic sequence, further confirming that the NLS properties were contained in this sequence. A peptide containing the prototypical polybasic NLS sequence of the SV40 large T-antigen was also able to inhibit the nuclear import mediated by IFN-γ(95–132). This observation suggests that the NLS in IFN-γ may function through the components of the Ran/importin pathway utilized by the SV40 T-NLS. Finally, we show that intact IFN-γ, when coupled to APC, was also able to mediate its nuclear import. Again, nuclear import was blocked by the peptide IFN-γ(95–132) and the SV40 T-NLS peptide, suggesting that intact IFN-γ was also transported into the nucleus through the Ran/importin pathway. Previous studies have suggested a direct intracellular role for IFN-γ in the induction of its biological activities. Based on our data in this study, we suggest that a key intracellular site of interaction of IFN-γ is the one with the nuclear transport mechanism that occurs via the NLS in the COOH terminus of IFN-γ. interferon(s) nuclear localization sequence allophycocyanin 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription nucleoprotein interactor-1. The interferons (IFNs)1are cytokines that use the well studied JAK/STAT pathway for signal transduction to the nucleus (1Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This pathway is initiated by the binding of the ligand to the extracellular domain of the appropriate receptor complex followed by the activation of select members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases at the intracellular cytoplasmic domain of the receptor subunits. These tyrosine kinases in turn phosphorylate appropriate members of the STAT family of transcription factors present in the cytoplasm, thereby targeting these factors, through unknown mechanisms, for translocation to the nucleus to activate transcription. Transcription factors the size of STATs must be taken into the cell nucleus by an active transport process through the nuclear pore complex. Active nuclear import of a large number of nuclear proteins occurs through the Ran/importin pathway (for review, see Ref. 2Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). In this pathway, the nuclear protein initially binds to a heterodimeric nuclear transport protein called importin which contains a α and β subunit. Nuclear proteins interact with the α subunit, importin α, of the transporter via a specific nuclear localization sequence (NLS). These NLSs generally consist of a cluster of basic amino acids or two short clusters separated by a spacer of variable length (a bipartite NLS; 2). The canonical simple polybasic NLS is represented by the sequence of the NLS of the SV40 T-antigen, KKKRK. The β subunit, importin β, in turn mediates the binding of the NLS-importin α complex to the GTPase Ran present at the nuclear pore complex. Nuclear import of this nuclear protein-bearing complex through the nuclear pore is initiated by Ran with the subsequent hydrolysis of GTP and ATP and hence is a strictly energy-dependent process (2Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the nuclear import of STAT1 requires active transport. Indeed, it has been shown recently that the IFN-γ-activated STAT1 is transported into the nucleus via the Ran/importin pathway by binding the importin α homolog NPI-1 (3Sekimoto T. Nakajima K. Tachibana T. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31017-31020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). NPI-1 is known to interact with nuclear proteins via the above polycationic NLSs. However, based on current knowledge, no polybasic NLS has been identified on STAT1 (3Sekimoto T. Nakajima K. Tachibana T. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31017-31020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of STAT1 failed to reveal a conventional NLS on STAT1 which was responsible for mediating the binding to NPI-1 or nuclear translocation of STAT1 (4Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These studies are consistent with the concept that the necessary basic NLS required for STAT1 interaction with NPI-1 is provided for by another molecule associated with STAT1. Based on the results of studies from our laboratory on the COOH-terminal domain of IFN-γ, IFN-γ(95–133), and its interaction with the α chain of the receptor, we propose that this candidate chaperone function may be served by the ligand IFN-γ (5Johnson H.M. Torres B.A. Green M.M. Szente B.E. Siler K.I. Larkin III, J. Subramaniam P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Crucial to this hypothesis, as a first step, is demonstrating that IFN-γ contains a functional NLS. In this report, we have specifically addressed this issue. It has been well documented that human and murine IFN-γ are themselves translocated to the nucleus (6MacDonald H.S. Kushnaryov V.M. Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Kushnaryov V.M. MacDonald H.S. Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The sequence of murine IFN-γ contains a putative polybasic NLS126RKRKRSR132 within the above mentioned COOH-terminal domain. It has been known for some time that this conserved sequence in murine and human IFN-γ is absolutely required for the biological activities of the corresponding IFN-γ (9Szente B.E. Soos J.M. Johnson H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1645-1654Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Szente B.E. Weiner I.J. Jablonsky M.J. Krishna N.R. Torres B.A. Johnson H.M. J.

Biochem. 1991; 202: 1133-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have also shown that both human and murine IFN-γ interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the α chain of the corresponding IFN-γ receptor complexes via this COOH-terminal domain containing this putative NLS sequence (17Szente B.E. Johnson H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Szente B.E. Subramaniam P.S. Johnson H.M. J.

Commun. 1998; 243: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). STAT1 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the α chain of the receptor at a downstream site. The interaction of the COOH terminus of IFN-γ with the α chain is dependent on the presence of the putative NLS sequence and in turn increases the affinity of the receptor-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 to an immediately proximal site on the α chain of the receptor (18Szente B.E. Subramaniam P.S. Johnson H.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5617-5622PubMed Google Scholar). JAK2, along with JAK1, is involved in the receptor recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT1, events that precede the subsequent nuclear translocation of STAT1. Thus, this COOH-terminal domain of IFN-γ has many characteristics that it make a good candidate to be involved in the chaperoning of STAT1α to the nucleus, probably as part of a ligand-receptor-STAT1α complex. Given the properties of this sequence, we tested in this study whether the above polybasic sequence in the COOH-terminal domain of IFN-γ can function as an NLS and facilitate the nuclear translocation of a heterologous protein. We demonstrate that this sequence is, indeed, an NLS and can function to import an associated non-NLS heterologous protein. The NLS functions in the strictly energy-dependent fashion typical of active nuclear import. Competition assays suggest that nuclear import driven by the IFN-γ NLS may functionally overlap with the Ran/importin pathway utilized by the SV40 T-NLS. Cell Culture—Mouse 3T3 cells (Balb/c, clone A31; from ATCC) were grown in ATCC-modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine serum. WISH cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated onto coverslips for 24 h before use. Peptides used in this study (see Table I) were synthesized on a PerSeptive Biosystems 9050 automated peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry as detailed previously (10Szente B.E.

Open table in a new tab Allophycocyanin (APC) activated with the bifunctional cross-linker succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate was purchased from Prozyme (San Leandro, CA) and used according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Briefly, peptides or human IFN-γ (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) reduced with dithiothreitol (50 mm) was coupled at a 1:1 or 1:2 molar ratio (APC:peptide) in 5 mm MES, pH 6.0, containing 5 mm EDTA. After the initial separation of uncoupled peptides by gel filtration through an Econo 10DG column (Bio-Rad) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, any residual peptide was removed by repeated concentration in the same buffer through a Centricon 50 ultrafiltration unit (MWCO 50,000; Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and the conjugate stored at 4 °C. Coupling efficiency (two or three peptides/APC) and peptide removal were established by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Transport assays with mouse A31 cells were based on methods described previously (for review, see Ref.20Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cells (both A31 and WISH cells) grown on coverslips were washed at 4 °C with transport buffer: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3; 110 mm potassium acetate; 5 mm sodium acetate; 2 mm magnesium acetate; 1 mm EGTA; 2 mm dithiothreitol; 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin; and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were then permeabilized with digitonin (at 40 μg/ml) in transport buffer for 5 min at 4 °C. After washing with transport buffer, cells were incubated with the transport reaction mixtures for 30 min at 30 °C. Complete reaction mixtures (60-μl final volume) contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3; 110 mm potassium acetate; 5 mm sodium acetate; 2 mm magnesium acetate; 1 mm EGTA; 2 mm dithiothreitol; 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin; 0.5 mm GTP; 2.5 mm ATP; 5 mm phosphocreatine (Calbiochem); 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (Calbiochem); approximately 200 nm appropriate import substrate; and 20 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (untreated; Promega, Madison, WI). Coverslips were washed in transport buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin, mounted on slides, and observed under a fluorescence microscope (cooled-CCD deconvolution microscopy). For ATP depletion experiments reticulocyte lysates were first treated with a mixture of hexokinase (∼300 units/ml), glucose (8 mm), and apyrase (0.2 units/ml) at 30 °C for 15 min before the addition of the rest of the components. For GTP dependence, GTP was omitted from the reaction mixture, and the reticulocyte lysate was incubated at room temperature with the analog GTPγS (Calbiochem) at 0.5 mm before the addition of other components. For peptide competition experiments, peptides were added at 600-fold molar excess, calculated with respect to APC, in the presence of all other components except the import substrate. After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the APC substrate was then added and the mixture incubated with the cells. The competence of the putative nuclear localization sequence within the COOH-terminal domain of IFN-γ to function in nuclear import was evaluated by testing its ability to mediate the nuclear import of a heterologous protein. This was performed using the standardin vitro nuclear transport assay (20Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) in digitonin-permeabilized mouse A31 cells. In this study, we used as substrate a peptide corresponding to amino acids 95–132 of murine IFN-γ (IFN-γ(95–132); see TableI) coupled to the heterologous autofluorescent protein APC to provide a substrate for the assay. As shown in Fig. 1, essentially a 100% of the A31 cells accumulated the IFN-γ(95–132)-APC substrate in the nucleus and nucleoli (compare Fig. 1, A and B). This accumulation was inhibited at 4 °C (Fig. 1 C) and was dependent on the addition of reticulocyte-derived cytosolic factors (Fig. 1 D). Addition of a simple mixture of IFN-γ(95–132) with carrier protein without covalent coupling did not lead to any nuclear staining (data not shown). These data show that the IFN-γ(95–132) was capable of mediating the nuclear import of a heterologous protein when coupled to it. The transport of karyophilic proteins across the nuclear membrane via the nuclear pore complex is an active, energy-dependent event (2Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). It depends strictly on the availability of both ATP and GTP. This energy-independent binding to the nuclear pore complex leads to a typical “rimming” pattern at the nuclear periphery (21Newmeyer D.D. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1988; 52: 641-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the nuclear import of IFN-γ(95–132)-APC was strictly energy-dependent. Cytosolic extracts depleted of ATP did not support the nuclear import of IFN-γ(95–132)-APC into the nucleus of A31 cells (compare Fig. 2,A and B). In the absence of ATP the IFN-γ(95–132)-APC substrate accumulates as a rim at the nuclear envelope. In a similar fashion, the absence of exogenous GTP coupled with the addition of the nonhydrolyzable analog GTPγS also resulted in failure of transport into the nucleus (Fig. 2 C) and resulted in the accumulation of the substrate at the nuclear periphery. Thus, these data further demonstrate that the domain represented by IFN-γ(95–132) contains an NLS that functions in a strictly energy-dependent fashion characteristic of nuclear import signals (2Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). To establish further the specificity of this NLS-bearing domain, we performed competition experiments using peptides to block the transport of the IFN-γ(95–132)-APC substrate. The peptides used were the following (see Table I): a peptide containing the NLS of the SV40 T-antigen (SV40 T-NLS); the IFN-γ(95–132) peptide; and the peptide IFN-γ(95–125), which is derived from IFN-γ(95–132) by deletion of the polybasic putative NLS, 126RKRKRSR132. The SV40 T-NLS is one of the best characterized NLSs that utilizes the well studied Ran/importin pathway for nuclear import (2Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). It contains an NLS that is a simple polybasic cluster similar to that in IFN-γ(95–132). As can be seen in Fig. 3, transport of IFN-γ(95–132)-APC was strongly inhibited in the presence of IFN-γ(95–132) (compare Fig. 3, A and B) and the SV40 NLS peptide (Fig. 3 C) but not by the shortened peptide IFN-γ(95–125) lacking the putative NLS (Fig. 3 D). We repeatedly saw staining in the cytoplasm whenever the NLS-containing peptides were added as competitors to block transport compared with nuclear translocation in their absence. Several important conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, the ability of IFN-γ(95–132) to inhibit transport of IFN-γ(95–132)-APC clearly demonstrates that the nuclear import of the substrate is specifically driven by the attached peptide IFN-γ(95–132), further establishing the specific ability of IFN-γ(95–132) to act as an NLS. Second, the ability of the SV40 T-NLS to inhibit transport of the substrate suggests that the nuclear import of IFN-γ(95–132)-APC occurs through the Ran/importin pathway that is utilized by the prototypical polybasic SV40 T-NLS. Third, the fact that IFN-γ(95–125) that is deleted in the polybasic putative NLS is unable to block the import of IFN-γ(95–132)-APC strongly suggests that the NLS is contained in the deleted sequence126RKRKRSR132. This sequence is very similar to that of the classical polybasic NLS contained in the SV40 T-NLS. Thus, it is consistent that the SV40 T-NLS peptide can block the import of IFN-γ(95–132)-APC. We conclude that IFN-γ(95–132) contains a classical polybasic NLS that clearly functions in nuclear import in a fashion similar to that of the prototypical SV40 T-NLS. The IFN-γ NLS probably utilizes components of the Ran/importin pathway common to the nuclear import pathway of the SV40 T-NLS. To confirm further that the polybasic sequence126RKRKRSR132 is responsible for the nuclear localization properties of IFN-γ(95–132) we tested directly the ability of the IFN-γ(95–125)-APC conjugate to function as a substrate in the nuclear import assays compared with IFN-γ(95–132)-APC. As shown in Fig. 4, in contrast to IFN-γ(95–132)-APC (Fig. 4 A), IFN-γ(95–125)-APC (Fig. 4 B and its phase-contrast image in 4D), which is deleted in the polybasic NLS region, was not able to function as a nuclear import substrate. We also tested the ability of a peptide derived from IFN-γ(95–132) where the sequence immediately NH2-terminal to the NLS has been deleted, namely IFN-γ(121–132) (see Table I). IFN-γ(121–132)-APC retained its ability to function as a substrate for nuclear import and appeared as effective as IFN-γ(95–132)-APC in nuclear import (Fig.4 C). These data clearly show that this polybasic sequence is necessary and sufficient for the nuclear targeting properties of the COOH-terminal domain IFN-γ(95–132). Finally, we demonstrated in these assays that intact IFN-γ itself has the ability to mediate nuclear import of a heterologous protein. As can be seen in Fig. 5, IFN-γ-APC was also transported into the nucleus (Fig. 5 A) in a fashion that was strictly dependent on the presence of cytosolic factors (Fig.5 B). A lower signal was observed in these assays compared with the transport of peptide-APC conjugates because of the lower coupling efficiency to APC. Nuclear import of IFN-γ-APC was strongly inhibited by competition with the IFN-γ(95–132) peptide and the SV40 T-NLS peptide. These data show that the nuclear import of IFN-γ itself is mediated in a fashion similar to IFN-γ(95–132) and the SV40 T-NLS and probably occurs via the classical Ran/importin pathway for nuclear import. In this report, we have demonstrated that the nuclear translocation of IFN-γ occurs via a classical polybasic NLS sequence,126RKRKRSR132, in the COOH terminus of the molecule. This sequence functions in the nuclear import of IFN-γ via an active energy-dependent process. Competition studies suggest that the NLS most likely utilizes components of the Ran/importin pathway that is common to the nuclear import mechanism of the prototype of this class of NLSs, namely the SV40 T-NLS. We have shown previously that this sequence is a critical requirement for the biological activity of the IFN-γ molecule (9Szente B.E. Soos J.M. Johnson H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1645-1654Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Szente B.E. Weiner I.J. Jablonsky M.J. Krishna N.R. Torres B.A. Johnson H.M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Several similar studies using human IFN-γ have shown that a highly homologous polybasic region within the COOH terminus is absolutely required for biological activity (11Arakawa T. Hsu Y.R.

Biochem. 1991; 202: 1133-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, in conjunction with these studies our data show that the nuclear localization of IFN-γ via this NLS serves a crucial role in the biological activity of IFN-γ. Previous studies have suggested a biological role for intracellular IFN-γ and IFN-α. These include the observations that (i) human IFN-γ delivered by a liposomal vector was able to activate murine macrophages (22Fidler I.J. Fogler W.E. Kleinerman E.S. Saiki I. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 4289-4296PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) secretion-defective human IFN-γ expressed in murine fibroblasts induced an antiviral state in these cells (23Sanceau J. Sondermeyer P. Beranger F. Falcoff R. Vaquero C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2906-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); (iii) microinjected IFN-γ can induce Ia expression on murine macrophages (24Smith M.R. Muegge K. Keller J.R. Kung H.F. Young H.A. Durum S.K. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1777-1782PubMed Google Scholar); and (iv) intracellularly expressed IFN-α is also active and can activate the DNA binding activity of the ISGF3 transcription complex containing STAT1α and STAT2 (25Rutherford M.N. Kumar A. Coulombe B. Skup D. Carver D.H. Williams B.R.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the IFN-γ most likely interacts with intracellular element(s) to induce a biological response. Based on our data in this study we suggest that a key intracellular interaction is the one with the nuclear transport mechanism which occurs via the NLS in the COOH terminus of IFN-γ. Our studies in this report have clearly identified for the first time the NLS in IFN-γ. Although it appears critical for biological activity of IFN-γ, the exact contribution of this NLS to biological function is less clear. Based on previous studies from our laboratory on the interaction of this domain of IFN-γ with the receptor and its effect on signaling components, we have speculated that a role for the NLS could be as a chaperone for the nuclear localization of activated STAT1α (5Johnson H.M. Torres B.A. Green M.M. Szente B.E. Siler K.I. Larkin III, J. Subramaniam P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that STAT1α is transported to the nucleus via the Ran/importin pathway (3Sekimoto T. Nakajima K. Tachibana T. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31017-31020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). STAT1α binds to the importin α homolog NPI-1 that mediates the nuclear import of substrates, like the SV40 T-NLS, in a conventional NLS-dependent fashion (4Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). However, mutation analysis of STAT1α has failed to reveal any sequence responsible for nuclear import of STAT1α (4Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These studies are consistent with a role for a STAT1α-associated molecule that binds importin α and provides the required NLS, i.e. the interaction of STAT1α with the Ran/importin system could be indirect. We suggest that the NLS required for nuclear import of STAT1α may be provided by the ligand IFN-γ, which interacts intracellularly at the level of the nuclear transport mechanism. Others have noted the presence of putative NLSs in other ligands and their receptors (26Jans D.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Jans D.A. Hassan G. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and have suggested a broad role for the nuclear targeting of ligands and/or their receptors in signaling to the nucleus (26Jans D.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In fact, recent studies have demonstrated that interleukin-1 and interleukin-5 possess functional NLSs (28Wessendorf J.H.M. Garfinkel S. Zhan X. Brown S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22100-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Jans D.A. Briggs L.J. Gustin S.E. Jans P. Ford S. Young I.G.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 368-372Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have found that when a comparison is made between such cytokines and their signaling pathways, a remarkable correlation exists between the ability of a cytokine to activate the JAK/STAT pathway and the presence of a putative NLS in either ligand or receptor (5Johnson H.M. Torres B.A. Green M.M. Szente B.E. Siler K.I. Larkin III, J. Subramaniam P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This raises the intriguing possibility that this model of ligand/receptor-assisted nuclear translocation of STATs may extend to other cytokine/receptor systems. In this regard, as outlined in the Introduction, we have already demonstrated that the COOH-terminal domain represented by IFN-γ(95–132) interacts specifically with the cytoplasmic domain of the α chain of the IFN-γ receptor (9Szente B.E. Soos J.M. Johnson H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1645-1654Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Szente B.E. Johnson H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Subramaniam P.S. Szente B.E. Johnson H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This interaction is also dependent on the presence of the NLS (9Szente B.E. Soos J.M. Johnson H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1645-1654Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Szente B.E. Johnson H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The α chain of the IFN-γ receptor is the subunit that binds activated STAT1α. We have recently shown using immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation techniques that after IFN-γ treatment of intact WISH cells, the cytoplasmic domain of the α chain of the IFN-γ receptor is also translocated rapidly to the nucleus. 2J. Larkin III, M. R. Paddy, H. M. Johnson, and P. S. Subramaniam, manuscript in preparation. This is specific to the α chain of the receptor because the β chain of the receptor complex, which does not bind STAT1α, did not undergo endocytosis or nuclear translocation. Furthermore, the pattern of receptor and STAT1α distribution throughout this process and the kinetics of receptor α chain and STAT1α translocation to the nucleus are very similar, consistent with the proposition that these events may be coupled. Because a putative NLS sequence cannot be identified in the receptor α chain, a likely scenario is that translocation of the receptor complex bearing STAT1α after ligand-dependent activation events is ultimately directed by the NLS in the ligand via the interaction of the NLS-containing domain in the ligand with the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor α chain. This scenario can be tested and is being examined in our ongoing studies."

During apoptosis, DFF-40/CAD is activated by caspase-3-mediated cleavage of DFF45/ICAD. Mutational analysis of DFF40/CAD revealed that DFF40/CAD is composed of a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain. Deletion of the catalytic domain (residues 290–345) abrogated the caspase-3-induced nuclease activity of DFF40/CAD but not its ability to interact with DFF45/ICAD. Conversely, removal of the regulatory domain (residues 1–83) yielded a constitutively active DFF40/CAD nuclease that neither bound to its inhibitor nor required caspase-3 for activation. Amino acid alignment revealed that the regulatory domain of DFF40/CAD has homology to the N-terminal region of mammalian andDrosophila DFF45/ICAD and CIDE-N, a regulatory domain previously identified in pro-apoptotic CIDE proteins. Mutational analysis of the N-terminal region revealed mutants with diminished nuclease activity but with intact ability to bind DFF45/ICAD. Thus, CIDE-N represents a new type of domain that is associated with the regulation of the apoptosis/DNA fragmentation pathway.

Apoptotic cells undergo multiple changes including membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation of genomic DNA into nucleosomal fragments.

However, the molecular basis for DFF40/CAD function and its regulation by DFF45/ICAD remains poorly understood.In a previous study, we identified a conserved family of proteins named CIDEs, that include CIDE-A, CIDE-B, and Fsp27, based on amino acid homology to the N-terminal region of DFF45/ICAD (9Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Unlike DFF45/ICAD, CIDEs are pro-apoptotic proteins that induce DNA fragmentation as well as other apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing and nuclear condensation (9Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S.

PGF synthase has at least two isoforms, the lung-type enzyme (K m value of 120 μm for PGD2 (Watanabe, K., Yoshida, R., Shimizu, T., and Hayaishi, O. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7035–7041) and the liver-type one (K m value of 10 μm for PGD2 (Chen, L. -Y., Watanabe, K., and Hayaishi, O. (1992)Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 296, 17–26)). The liver-type enzyme was presently found to consist of a 969-base pair open reading frame coding for a 323-amino acid polypeptide with aM r of 36,742. Sequence analysis indicated that the bovine liver PGF synthase had 87, 79, 77, and 76% identity with the bovine lung PGF synthase and human liver dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DD) isozymes DD1, DD2, and DD4, respectively. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the liver-type PGF synthase was identical with that of bovine liver DD3. The liver-type PGF synthase was expressed in COS-7 cells, and its recombinant enzyme had almost the same properties as the native enzyme. Furthermore, to investigate the nature of catalysis and/or substrate binding of PGF synthase, we constructed and characterized various mutant enzymes as follows: R27E, R91Q, H170C, R223L, K225S, S301R, and N306Y. Although the reductase activities toward PGH2 and phenanthrenequinone (PQ) of almost all mutants were not inactivated, the K m values of R27E, R91Q, H170C, R223L, and N306Y for PGD2 were increased from 15 to 110, 145, 75, 180, and 100 μm, respectively, indicating that Arg27, Arg91, His170, Arg223, and Asn306 are essential to give a low K m value for PGD2 of the liver-type PGF synthase and that these amino acid residues serve in the binding of PGD2. Moreover, the R223L mutant among these seven mutants especially has a profound effect on k cat for PGD2 reduction. TheK m values of R223L, K225S, and S301R for PQ were about 2–10-fold lower than the wild-type value, indicating that the amino acid residues at 223, 225 and 301 serve in the binding of PQ to the enzyme. On the other hand, the K m value of H170C for PGH2 was 8-fold lower than that of the wild type, indicating that the amino acid residue at 170 is related to the binding of PGH2 to the enzyme and that Cys170 confer high affinity for PGH2. Additionally, the 5-fold increase in k cat/K m value of the N306Y mutant for PGH2 compared with the wild-type value suggests that the amino acid at 306 plays an important role in catalytic efficiency for PGH2.

TheK m values of R223L, K225S, and S301R for PQ were about 2–10-fold lower than the wild-type value, indicating that the amino acid residues at 223, 225 and 301 serve in the binding of PQ to the enzyme. On the other hand, the K m value of H170C for PGH2 was 8-fold lower than that of the wild type, indicating that the amino acid residue at 170 is related to the binding of PGH2 to the enzyme and that Cys170 confer high affinity for PGH2. Additionally, the 5-fold increase in k cat/K m value of the N306Y mutant for PGH2 compared with the wild-type value suggests that the amino acid at 306 plays an important role in catalytic efficiency for PGH2. prostaglandin 9, 10-phenanthrene quinone dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase potassium phosphate buffer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction. F series prostaglandins (PG)1 are widely distributed in various organs of mammals and exhibit a variety of biological activities including constriction of pulmonary arteries (1Hyman A.L. J.

PGF2 is synthesized from PGE2, PGD2, or PGH2 by PGE 9-ketoreductase, PGD 11-ketoreductase, or PGH 9,11-endoperoxide reductase, respectively. PGF synthase (EC 1.1.1.188) was purified from bovine lung by Watanabeet al. (3Watanabe K. Yoshida R. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of other carbonyl compounds including 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PQ) as well as that of PGD2 and PGH2 but does not catalyze the reduction of PGE2. Although PGD211-ketoreductase activity was competitively inhibited by PQ, PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase activity was not inhibited by PGD2 or PQ (3Watanabe K. Yoshida R. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7035-7041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PGF synthase belongs to the aldo-keto reductase family. The bovine lung PGF synthase is a monomeric protein with a M r of 36,666 consisting of 323 amino acids, and its amino acid sequence shows high homology compared with that of other aldo-keto reductase family members (5Watanabe K. Fujii Y. Nakayama K. Ohkubo H. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Nakanishi S. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). PGF synthase has two isozymes, one in the lung (3Watanabe K. Yoshida R. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7035-7041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the other one in the liver (6Chen L.-Y. Watanabe K. Hayaishi O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), with different K m values for PGD2 (120 and 10 μm, respectively). The regulation by metals, the sensitivity to chloride ions, the inhibition by CuSO4 and HgCl2, and the profile of immuno-precipitation with anti-bovine lung PGF synthase antibody are different between the two isozymes (6Chen L.-Y. Watanabe K. Hayaishi O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although Kuchinke et al. (7Kuchinke W. Barski O. Watanabe K. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1238-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) isolated a clone (PGFS II) of PGF synthase from bovine liver and determined its amino acid sequence, the 99% similarity with the amino acid sequence of lung PGF synthase and the high K m value for PGD2 of this recombinant PGFS II indicated that its cDNA was that of the lung-type enzyme even though it had been isolated from liver. Until now, the primary structure of the liver-type PGF synthase and the amino acids related to the affinity for PGD2 have not yet been defined.Dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DD, EC 1.3.1.20) catalyzes the NADP-linked oxidation of trans-dihydrodiols of aromatic hydrocarbons to the corresponding catechols and is distributed in various mammalian tissues. DD, also belonging to the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, has been purified from various animal tissues, i.e. human liver (8Hara A. Taniguchi T. Nakayama T. Sawada H. J. Biochem.

Taniguchi T. Nakayama T. Sawada H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Human DD3 was identified as an aldehyde reductase, and the other three forms exhibited 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD, EC1.1.1.213) activity. Bovine liver DD also has three multiple forms (DD1–DD3), namely DD1 (3α-HSD), DD2 (high K maldehyde reductase), and DD3 (dihydrodiol-specific enzyme) (13Nanjo H. Adachi H. Morihana S. Mizoguchi T. Nishihara T. Terada T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Human liver DD1, DD2, and DD3 are not identical with bovine liver DD1, DD2, and DD3, respectively, on the basis of their enzymatic properties including the substrate specificity. The amino acid sequence of the bovine lung-type PGF synthase (3Watanabe K. Yoshida R. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 414: 545-553Crossref Google Scholar). Among human liver DDs, DD1 and DD2 exhibited PGF synthase activity with K m values of 12 and 79 μm, respectively, for PGD2, but this activity of DD4 was not detected (16Hara A. Matsuura K. Tamada Y. Sato K. Miyabe Y. Deyashiki Y. Ishida N. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, PGF synthase activity of bovine liver DD3 has not yet been reported.In the present study, we describe the primary structure of the bovine liver-type PGF synthase and the enzymatic properties of the recombinant enzyme in COS-7 cells. Based on the comparison of the amino acid sequences among the liver-type and the lung-type PGF synthases and human liver DDs, several mutants were constructed, and their enzymatic properties were examined. The results of mutagenesis indicated the amino acid residues related to the binding sites of PGD2, PGH2, and PQ.DISCUSSIONWe isolated a clone of the liver-type PGF synthase with a lowK m value for PGD2 from the cDNA library of bovine liver, expressed the enzyme in COS-7 cells, and constructed seven mutants. Moreover, we examined the enzymatic properties of the wild-type enzyme and of the mutant enzymes, and we investigated the amino acid residue(s) related to the affinity of PGF synthase for the substrates.The amino acid sequence of the liver-type PGF synthase consisted of 323 amino acid residues with a M r of 36,742 (Fig. 1) and showed 87% identity with that of the lung-type synthase (Fig. 2). When the liver-type enzyme was expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3), the recombinant purified protein (Fig. 3, B and C, and Table I) was essentially identical to the native liver-type enzyme and not to the lung-type enzyme, based on the enzymatic properties (Table II) including the low K m value (15 μm) for PGD2 and the results of Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). These results suggest that this liver-type PGF synthase is distinct from the lung-type PGF synthase isolated from the cDNA library of bovine lung (5Watanabe K. Fujii Y. Nakayama K. Ohkubo H. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Nakanishi S. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) or liver (7Kuchinke W. Barski O. Watanabe K. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1238-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Recently, Jez et al. (23Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) reported on a structure/function analysis of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. They reported that five amino acid residues, i.e. Asp50, Asn167, Gln190, Ser271, and Arg276, and three residues, i.e.Asp50, Tyr55, and Lys84, function in cofactor binding and in the active site, respectively. Based on the locations of the cofactor-binding pocket and the active site, a putative substrate-binding site was also proposed. However, the binding site for PGs has not yet been reported. The amino acid sequence of the liver-type PGF synthase was highly homologous with those sequences of DD1, DD2, and DD4 of human liver (Fig. 2), and DD1 and DD2 exhibited PGD2 11-ketoreductase activity (16Hara A. Matsuura K. Tamada Y. Sato K. Miyabe Y. Deyashiki Y. Ishida N. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Based on the comparison among the amino acid sequences of human liver DDs (15Deyashiki Y. Ogasawara A. Nakayama T. Nakanishi M. Miyabe Y. Sato K. Hara A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Hara A. Matsuura K. Tamada Y. Sato K. Miyabe Y. Deyashiki Y. Ishida N. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the lung-type and the liver-type PGF synthases, we studied the site-directed mutagenesis to change seven amino acid residues as follows: R27E, R91Q, H170C, R223L, K225S, S301R, and N306Y. All mutants expressed the proteins in COS-7 cells to almost the same extent as the wild-type protein, suggesting that the tertiary structures of these mutants were not drastically changed. Moreover, all mutants retained the activity with above 50% ofk cat/K m values of the wild type for PGH2 and PQ, indicating that the structures of all mutants were conserved. Therefore, the change in the enzymatic properties of the mutants reflected the mutation of the amino acid residue and not a change in the structure. Judging from the results of this study, Arg27, Arg91, His170, Arg223, and Asn306 are essential to give a lowK m value for PGD2 and play an important role in the binding of PGD2; and the amino acid residue at 223 has a significant effect on k cat for PGD2 reduction. Moreover, the results ofK m of the R223L, K225S, and S301R mutants for PQ and PGD2 show that R223L, K225S, and S301R mutations acquired high binding for PQ and low for PGD2. Leu223, Ser225, and Arg301 of the lung-type PGF synthase have a positive effect on the binding of PQ. In terms of the binding site for PGH2, the amino acid residue at 170 seems to be related to the binding of this PG and that at 306 plays an important role in k cat/K m of this PG.Twelve amino acid residues among the 42 amino acid residues of the liver-type enzyme that differed from those of the lung-type one were located in the α-helix or β-sheet, and the other 30 amino acid residues were located in loop structures of the tertiary structure of the liver-type PGF synthase, as inferred from data on human aldose reductase (24Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 25Rondeau J.-M. Tete-Favier F. Podjarny A. Reymann J.-M. Barth P. Biellmann J.-F. Moras D. Nature. 1992; 355: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and rat 3α-HSD (26Hoog S.S. Pawlowski J.E. Alzari P.M. Penning T.M. Lewis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2517-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), which showed 46 and 70% identity, respectively, in terms of amino acid sequence with bovine liver-type PGF synthase. As a general rule, an amino acid(s) located in an α-helix or a β-sheet is involved in supporting the tertiary structure and that in loop structures of aldo-keto reductases is related to define substrate specificity (23Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 27Jez J.M. Schlegel B.P. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30190-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although His170 is located in an α-helix of the inferred tertiary structure of the liver-type PGF synthase, the amino acid residue at this position in the aldo-keto reductase family shows variation and is located near Asn167, which makes hydrogen bonds with the carboxyamide moiety of the cofactor (23Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). His170 was changed to Cys of DD4, which has no PGD2 11-ketoreductase activity. The k cat/K m values of this mutant for PGD2 was 16% that of the wild type, and its 1/K m value decreased to about 20% that of the wild type. On the other hand, thek cat/K m values of this mutant for PGH2 were about 6-fold that of the wild type, and its 1/K m value of this mutant increased to 8-fold that of the wild type. These results indicate that the amino acid residue at 170 seems to be related to the binding for PGD2 and to that for PGH2. The reverse effects of the H170C mutant on PGD2 and PGH2 reductase activities indicate that His and Cys at 170 play an important role in the binding of PGD2 and PGH2.Arg27, Arg91, Arg223, Lys225, Ser301, and Asn306 located in a loop structure are related to the binding site of PGD2, PQ, or PGH2. Jez et al. (27Jez J.M. Schlegel B.P. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30190-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported that Trp86 and Trp227 of the 3α-HSD near the active site may have roles in substrate binding. They proposed that Trp86 is important in binding to a steroid ligand, whose A-ring lies between this Trp and the cofactor, and that Trp227 interacts with the C- and/or D-rings of steroid ligands. The effect of R91Q on PGD2 taken together with the report on Trp86 of the 3α-HSD suggests that Arg91 near Trp86 is a part of the substrate-binding pocket for PGD2. Moreover, although the effects of W227Y on thek cat/K m values for steroids are dramatic, smaller effects of this mutant on those for one-, two-, and three-ring substrates are also shown in this order (27Jez J.M. Schlegel B.P. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30190-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PGD2 has one cyclopentane ring and two long tails (ω- and α-chains), and Arg223 and Lys225 are also located near Trp227. The results of the R223L mutant for PGD2 suggest that Arg223 is an essential amino acid residue to give a low K m value for PGD2 of the liver-type PGF synthase and that the amino acid residue at 223 plays an important role in k catof PGD2 reduction. The results of the R223L and K225S mutants for PQ suggest that Leu223 and Ser225have a significant effect on the binding of PQ. PGD2 and PQ seem to bind to the same apolar pocket of PGF synthase differently, like steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and aldose reductase inhibitors of 3α-HSD (27Jez J.M. Schlegel B.P. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30190-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, the effect of S301R on PQ suggests that Ser301 also has a role in the binding of PQ to the enzyme. Asn306, located in the C-terminal region, may have structural importance for the binding of the substrate. Members of the NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductase superfamily are in part distinguished by unique C-terminal loops (28Oleg A.B. Kenneth H.G. Bohren K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14276-14280Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Bohren K.M. Grimshaw C.E. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). C-terminal loops of aldo-keto reductase are unique for each member and differ drastically in length and amino acid composition; and the C-terminal loop is critical for catalytic efficiency and for substrate and inhibitor specificity (28Oleg A.B. Kenneth H.G. Bohren K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14276-14280Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Bohren K.M. Grimshaw C.E. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the case of PGF synthases, the C-terminal region may be also critical for the affinity and specificity for the substrate. 2M. Sato, M. Tanaka, K. Ikehara, T. Suzuki, and K. Watanabe, manuscript in preparation. The effect on the binding of the N306Y mutant for PGD2 and that onk cat/K m of this mutant for PGH2 also suggest that Asn306 is a critical determinant of PGs.Considering the one binding site for NADPH in the inferred tertiary structure of the liver-type PGF synthase, the catalytic site for the various substrates of aldo-keto reductase including PGF synthase seems to be the same. Tyr55 of aldo-keto reductase is favored as the catalytic acid in the reaction mechanism (23Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Tyr55 of PGF synthase also plays the same role as that of the corresponding position in the other aldo-keto reductases.2 The Y55F mutation eliminated PGD2, PGH2, and PQ reductase activities of PGF synthase completely.2 However, although PGD2 and PQ reductase activities of Y55Q were eliminated completely, only PGH2 reductase activity of this mutant was stimulated, 27-fold.2 These results suggest that Tyr55 is favored as the catalytic residue, but the reduction mechanism, which involves a hydride transfer from NADPH to the substrate and protonation of the oxygen by a residue of the enzyme acting as a general acid, may be different between PGH2 and PGD2/PQ. The reduction site of PGD2 is the keto group like other carbonyl compounds but that of PGH2 is the endoperoxide group. Moreover, the results of the reverse effects of H170C and N306Y on PGD2 and PGH2 reductase activities shown in this paper, taken together with the results on the competitive inhibition between PGD2 and PQ (3Watanabe K. Yoshida R. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7035-7041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on the lack of inhibition between PGH2 and PGD2/PQ (3Watanabe K. Yoshida R. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7035-7041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,6Chen L.-Y. Watanabe K. Hayaishi O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicate that the reduction mechanism for PGD2 may be the same as that for PQ but not the same as that for PGH2.3α-HSD, which catalyzes the NADP-dependent reversible oxidation of the 3α-hydroxy group of various steroids, interacts extensively with bile acids (31Stolz A. Takikawa H. Ookhtens M. Kaplowitz N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); and it and human liver high affinity bile acid-binding protein with minimal 3α-HSD activity are multifunctional proteins in bile acid transport and xenobiotic metabolism (32Stolz A. Hammond L. Lou H. Takikawa H. Ronk M. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10448-10457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of HSD and high affinity bile acid-binding protein are similar to the sequence of bovine liver PGF synthase, and DD2 and DD4 exhibited binding activity for bile acids (33Deyashiki Y. Taniguchi H. Amano T. Nakayama T. Hara A. Sawada H. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, bovine liver PGF synthase may also be expected to exhibit the ability to bind bile acids. In the liver, PGF2α, PGE2, and PGD2 reduce bile flow and bile acid secretion, and especially the effect of PGF2α is more potent than that of PGE2 or PGD2 (34Beckh K. Kneip S. Arnold R. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 1208-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PGF synthase may be multifunctionally involved in the biosynthesis of PGF and in the binding of bile acids, and PGF synthase in the liver may reduce bile flow. Moreover, PGF2α stimulates hepatocyte DNA synthesis and may have a role in promoting hepatocyte proliferation (35Refsnes M. Thoresen G.H. Dajani O.F. Christoffersen T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36Dajani O.F. Rottingen J.A. Sandnes D. Horn R.S. Refsnes M. Thoresen G.H. Iversen J.-G. Christoffersen T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 608-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PGF2α and PGD2 are released from primary Ito cell cultures after stimulation by noradrenaline and ATP (37Athari A. Hanecke K. Jungermann K. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 142-148PubMed Google Scholar). PGF2α plays an important physiological role in the liver, and the liver-type PGF synthase mainly contributes to the biosynthesis of PGF2α there.Recently, the sequence of the bovine liver DD3 (17Terada T. Adachi H. Nanjo H. Fujita N. Takagi T. Nishikawa M. Imagawa M. Nishihara T. Maeda M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 414: 545-553Crossref Google Scholar) was reported. The sequence of the liver-type PGF synthase reported in this paper was found to be identical to that of the bovine liver DD3. The liver-type PGF synthase showed the enzyme activity for (S)-(+)-indanol (6.3 μmol/min/mg), 3T. Suzuki, and K. Watanabe, unpublished results. which is a typical substrate of DD3 (13Nanjo H. Adachi H. Morihana S. Mizoguchi T. Nishihara T. Terada T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 17Terada T. Adachi H. Nanjo H. Fujita N. Takagi T. Nishikawa M. Imagawa M. Nishihara T. Maeda M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 414: 545-553Crossref Google Scholar). However, PG(s) is the naturally occurring substrate(s) for this enzyme, as indanole is a xenobiotic compound. F series prostaglandins (PG)1 are widely distributed in various organs of mammals and exhibit a variety of biological activities including constriction of pulmonary arteries (1Hyman A.L. J.

PGF2 is synthesized from PGE2, PGD2, or PGH2 by PGE 9-ketoreductase, PGD 11-ketoreductase, or PGH 9,11-endoperoxide reductase, respectively. PGF synthase (EC 1.1.1.188) was purified from bovine lung by Watanabeet al. (3Watanabe K. Yoshida R. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

We characterized the transcription factor complexes binding to the TF gene promoter LPS response element (LRE) (−220 to −172), which contains binding sites for nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and activator protein 1 (AP1) transcription factors, and examined the nature of the activation of these factors during a 24-h time course of LPS stimulation. We found proteolysis of the cytoplasmic inhibitory protein IκBα and nuclear translocation of the NFκB/Rel family proteins p65 and c-Rel, corresponding to the transient binding of a p65/c-Rel heterodimer to the κB-like site of the LRE. AP1 binding to the LRE was found to be constitutive, with the majority of the AP1 complexes being JunD/Fra-2 heterodimers. A change in the activation state of the AP1 complexes was, however, found to be transient, as determined by JunD phosphorylation of AP1 bound to the proximal binding site. This directly correlates to the transient activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK). These data indicate that LPS induction of TF gene expression in monocytic THP-1 cells is regulated by both the transient phosphorylation of Jun-family proteins and the nuclear translocation and transient binding of NFκB/Rel proteins.

Tissue factor (TF)1 is the primary initiator of the serine protease cascade of the coagulation system (1Edgington T.S. Mackman N. Brand K. Ruf W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). TF is constitutively expressed in a number of different cell types that do not normally come into contact with blood (2Drake T.A. Morrisey J.H. Edgington T.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 134: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar) but is of necessity not usually expressed within the vasculature. However, in various disease states, aberrant TF expression in vascular cells may lead to thrombosis, such as during sepsis, when bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) induction of TF in monocytes can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (3Osterud B. Flaestad T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1983; 49: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Monocytes are the only circulating cells in which TF expression is subject to inducible regulation (4Mackman N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Synthesis may be up-regulated by a number of different stimuli including phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) (5Lyberg T. Prydz H. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor-α (6Conkling P.R. Greenberg C.S. Weinberg J.B. Blood. 1988; 72: 128-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (7Niemetz J. Morrison D.C. Blood. 1977; 49: 947-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gregory S.A. Morrisey J.H. Edgington T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2752-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In LPS-induced monocytes, TF mRNA levels increase as a result of transcriptional activation (7Niemetz J. Morrison D.C. Blood. 1977; 49: 947-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the monocytic cell line THP-1, TF gene expression is induced by LPS in a similar manner with, however, some increase in mRNA stability as well (9Brand K. Fowler B.J. Edgington T.S. Mackman N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4732-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Functional studies in THP-1 cells identified an enhancer in the TF gene promoter that mediates LPS induction. This 56-base pair region (−227 to −172) is termed the LPS response element (LRE) (10Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In addition, a second region (−85 to −52) containing Egr-1 binding sites has been identified that is also subject to inducible binding (11Groupp E.R. Donovan-Peluso M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our study focused on the LRE that contains two AP-1 sites (a distal, low affinity site and a proximal, high affinity site) and an NFκB-like site. Mutation of any of these sites compromises LPS inducibility (10Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 12Oeth P. Parry G.C.N. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting that all three are required for optimal LPS induction. In this study we have analyzed the protein interactions with the LRE binding sites over a 24-h time course of LPS induction in THP-1 cells. We have determined that a number of regulatory mechanisms act to control TF gene transcription in response to LPS stimulation. These include the transient binding of a p65/c-Rel heterodimer from at least 30 min to 2 h, resulting from the proteolysis of IκBα and nuclear translocation of p65 and c-Rel and transient phosphorylation of JunD in LRE-bound AP-1 complexes correlating to the activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) from 10 min up to 1 h of LPS treatment. These data suggest multiple mechanisms acting co-operatively at the LRE enhancer element to direct a transient increase in TF mRNA levels in monocytic THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells (13Tsuchiya N. Yamabe M. Yamaguchi Y. Kobayashi Y. Konno T. Tada K. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 26: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 withl-glutamine and 25 mm HEPES buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were routinely grown to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and induced with 10 μg/ml LPS from Salmonella typhimurium (Sigma) for the times indicated in the figures. THP-1 cells were recovered from suspension and washed in phosphate- buffered saline. Cell extracts were then prepared, and TF antigen levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described by Consonni and Bertina (14Consonni R. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 904-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), using TF 4503 monoclonal antibody (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) as the catching antibody and biotinylated TF 5 monoclonal antibody (Costar) as the tagging antibody. Recomboplastin S/Innovin (Baxter Diagnostica Inc., Deerfield, IL) was used as a standard after calibration against the standard of the Immubind tissue factor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT). The final results were expressed as ng TF/106 cells. Total RNA was prepared from THP-1 cells using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), a modification of the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63167) Google Scholar). 15 μg of total RNA/time point were fractionated on 1% agarose, 0.22m formaldehyde gels in 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA and 0.22m formaldehyde. After staining with ethidium bromide and visualization of the ribosomal RNA under UV light, RNA was transferred to Hybond-N filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by standard capillary transfer methods (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA was then immobilized by UV irradiation on a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). Filters were prehybridized for 3 h at 42 °C in 50% deionized formamide, 0.5% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 5 × SSPE (0.9m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.7, 0.5 mm Na2EDTA), and 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. Filters were then hybridized for 18 h under the same conditions with an [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)-labeled 601-base pair HhaI-EcoRI TF cDNA probe (17van der Logt C.P.E. Reitsma P.H. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 67: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). They were washed in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS for 2 × 15 min at room temperature followed by two 15-min washes in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Filters were exposed to film at −70 °C with intensifying screens. Equivalence of loading was controlled for by rehybridization of stripped blots with a32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (18Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Crude nuclear extracts were prepared for use in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) essentially as described previously (11Groupp E.R. Donovan-Peluso M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Modifications include cell shearing by repeated aspiration through a 27-gauge needle rather than a Dounce homogenizer and the addition of phosphatase inhibitors (0.25 mm orthovanadate and 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate) to all solutions. Protein concentrations of all extracts were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. The following oligonucleotides were radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Epicentre Technologies) and [γ32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) before being annealed to oligonucleotides of complementary sequence. TFAP1distal, (−230 to −211) GCGCGGTTGAATCACTGGGG; AP1pκB (containing the TF LRE proximal AP1 site and the NFκB site), (−213 to −172) GGGTGAGTCATCCCTTGCAGGGTCCCGGAGTTTCCTACCGGG; TFκB, (−193 to −174) GGTCCCGGAGTTTCCTACCG; and the NFκB consensus, GGGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAG. Additional double-stranded oligonucleotides used as competitors include the AP1 consensus, GCCGCAAGTGACTCAGCGCGGG, and an Sp1 site from the TF promoter (−96 to −66) used in the current context as a nonspecific competitor, AGTCGGGAGGAGCGGCGGGGGCGGGCGCCGG. Two binding reaction buffers were used; one optimized for AP1 binding (binding buffer 1: 23 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 113 mm NaCl, 9 mmMgCl2, 0.23 mm EDTA, 19% glycerol, 4.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.75 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.75 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, pepstatin A) (11Groupp E.R. Donovan-Peluso M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and a second optimized for NFκB binding (binding buffer 2: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 19% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, pepstatin A) (19Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11803-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 20 μl of binding reactions contained 5 μg of nuclear extract, 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, and 3 μg poly(dI-dC), unless otherwise stated. When looking specifically for phosphorylated proteins, the binding reactions also contained orthovanadate and β-glycerophosphate at final concentrations of 0.25 mm and 25 mm, respectively. Reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min before electrophoresis through 6%, 0.5× TGE (1× TGE-25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 10 mmEDTA) polyacrylamide gels. For competition assays and supershift assays, a preincubation at 4 °C for 12–16 h with a 100-fold molar excess of competitor or 1 μg of antibody, respectively, was carried out before the addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. Gels were dried under vacuum and exposed at −70 °C with intensifying screens. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts used in the Western blot analyses were prepared essentially as described for EMSAs with the exception of Nonidet P-40 being added to the cells to a final concentration of 0.5% following shearing by aspiration, for extracts used to examine NFκB compartmentalization. After centrifugation of the lysed cells, the supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C as the cytoplasmic extract. Again, the protein concentrations of all extracts were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (a modification of the Bradford protein assay (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar)). 20 μg of nuclear extracts or 60 μg of cytoplasmic extracts were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) in 48 mm Tris, 58.6 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, 20% methanol at 0.8 V/cm2 for 2.5 h using the Nova Blot system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blots were blocked, and immunoreactive products were detected according to the protocol of the Boehringer Mannheim chemiluminescence Western blotting kit. Briefly, blots were blocked in 1% blocking solution overnight at 4 °C then washed in TBST (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The blots were then incubated with the primary antibodies (Santa Cruz, Transcruz antibodies diluted 1:10,000 in 0.5% (w/v) blocking solution and phospho-specific antibodies diluted 1:1,000 in TBST, 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). The secondary antibody incubation was in 0.5% blocking solution containing 1:10,000 goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Bio-Rad) and 1:2,000 anti-biotin antibody (New England Biolabs) to detect the biotinylated protein standard used (New England Biolabs). Comparative blots of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were performed simultaneously and exposed to film for the same length of time. The polyclonal antibodies used in the EMSA supershift assays and Western blot analyses were as follows: c-Jun/AP-1 (sc-44x); c-Jun/AP-1 (sc-45x); JunB (sc-46x); JunD (sc-74x); ATF-2 (sc-187x); c-Fos (sc-253x); c-Fos (sc-52x); FosB (sc-48x); Fra-1 (sc-605x); Fra-2 (sc-171x); NFκB p50 (sc-114x); NFκB p52 (sc-298x); NFκB p65 (sc-109x); RelB (sc-226x); c-Rel (C) (sc-71x); c-Rel (N) (sc-70x), all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; phospho-specific c-Jun (Ser-73) (9164); phospho-specific ATF-2 (Thr 71) (9221); SAPK/JNK (9252); phospho-specific SAPK/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) (9251) were all from New England Biolabs. The α-tubulin antibody used in the Western blot analysis was a kind gift from Dr. Ingrid Gaemers obtained from Dr. Pavel Draber (21Vicklicky V. Draber P. Hasek J. Bartek J. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1982; 6: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Draber P. Draberova E. Linhartova I. Vicklicky V. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 519-528PubMed Google Scholar). To determine their response to LPS, monocytic THP-1 cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml LPS for various times up to 24 h. TF mRNA, analyzed by Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 1), increased by 30 min and reached a peak at 1 h. Levels dropped considerably by 2 h and had returned to preinduction levels at the following time points. Larger transcripts resulting from incomplete splicing (17van der Logt C.P.E. Reitsma P.H. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 67: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) can be seen in addition to the mature 2.2-kilobase mRNA. A corresponding increase in the level of TF antigen was also observed, reaching a peak at 2 h then decreasing through to 24 h (data not shown). The EMSA studies presented were predominantly carried out using the AP1PκB oligonucleotide (−213 to −172). This region of the TF LRE was chosen as AP1 consists of various dimers of Fos and Jun family proteins, and this oligonucleotide together with TFAP1distal, allowed us to distinguish between AP1 complexes binding to the proximal and distal AP1 sites while maintaining possible effects on complex binding arising from the proximity of the adjacent high affinity proximal AP1 site and the κB-like site. We found that variation in the binding reaction conditions had a noticeable effect on the relative intensities of the DNA-protein complexes that were observed (Fig.2). Under conditions that seemed to favor AP1 binding (binding buffer 1) two complexes became apparent whose intensity appears to be relatively constant throughout the time course (Fig. 2 A). A very faint larger complex (I) and a smaller doublet complex (II), which constituted the majority of the binding to this oligonucleotide, are seen. Both complexes I and II could be competed with a 100-fold molar excess of AP1PκB and an AP1 consensus competitor but not with an NFκB consensus or a nonspecific competitor (Sp1), indicating that both complex I and II are AP1 complexes. Constitutive binding of an AP1 complex throughout the 24-h time course was also observed using an oligonucleotide containing the distal AP1 site (data not shown). Under the conditions of binding buffer 2 (Fig. 2 B), we see a much lower intensity of complex II, with complex I no longer visible, whereas complexes III and IV become more obvious. Complexes III and IV begin to appear at 30 min, with binding reaching a peak at 1–2 h. At 4 h and later, their presence is no longer detected. A 100-fold molar excess of AP1PκB or the NFκB consensus oligonucleotide both compete complexes III and IV. The AP1 consensus competes complex II (as seen in Fig. 2 A), whereas the nonspecific competitor (Sp1) appears to compete only complex IV. These data demonstrate the transient binding of two NFκB complexes to the oligonucleotide between 30 min and 2 h, of which only complex III appears to have high affinity for the κB-like site. Under conditions where the ratio of nuclear proteins to oligonucleotide is much higher (200-fold higher, binding buffer 1, Fig. 2 C) we see the appearance of a new larger complex (V). This complex is present from 30 min to 2 h, similar to complexes III and IV binding in Fig. 2 B. The AP1PκB oligonucleotide and the NFκB consensus oligonucleotide compete complex V, as does the AP1 consensus competitor (in addition to complex II). A nonspecific competitor (Sp1) has no effect. These results indicate that complex V is a complex of the oligonucleotide AP1PκB with both AP1 and NFκB binding simultaneously. Supershift assays were carried out with the AP1PκB oligonucleotide, the TF κB-like site oligonucleotide and the NFκB consensus oligonucleotide, and antibodies against specific NFκB/Rel proteins. With AP1PκB (Fig. 3,lanes 1–10), supershifts of complex III were observed with an antibody against p65 and to a lesser extent, anti-c-Rel, but not with antibodies specific for other members of the NFκB/Rel family. The complex formed with the TFκB oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, lanes 11–20) had the same mobility and transient binding characteristics as complex III and was also supershifted by antibodies against p65 and c-Rel. The affinity of protein complexes for the TFκB site in isolation was much lower than with the adjacent AP1 proximal site present (lanes 11–20 of Fig. 3 were exposed four times longer than the rest of the assay). The complex formed with the NFκB consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, lanes 21–30) was supershifted by antibodies against p50 and p65 but not by antibodies specific for other members of the NFκB/Rel family. These data show complex III to be a p65/c-Rel heterodimer. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS for the times indicated in the figure were examined by Western blot analyses (Fig.4). Antibodies against p65 and c-Rel, the component proteins of the higher affinity complex III, and also the cytoplasmic inhibitory protein IκBα, were used. When nuclear extracts used in the EMSA studies were examined with an antibody against a cytoplasmic protein (α-tubulin) in Western blot analysis a certain proportion of cytoplasmic protein was observed. Therefore, to attain a greater degree of nuclear/cytoplasmic separation, an adapted technique of preparation was used (see “Experimental Procedures”). However, rather than single bands corresponding to the p65 and c-Rel proteins, we observe multiple bands after immunostaining of the Western blots, which we would suggest are because of partial degradation of the proteins during this preparation procedure. However, because we are mainly concerned with the localization of these proteins, the degradation was not considered to impede the interpretation of the data. IκBα and Fos/Jun family proteins show relatively little degradation on Western blots, indicating that p65 and c-Rel may be particularly susceptible to breakdown with this preparation method. We can see that very little p65 is evident in the nucleus in unstimulated cells. After 10 min of LPS induction, nuclear p65 begins to appear and peak at 1 h, declining again by 2 h. A concomitant decrease in cytoplasmic p65 corresponds to the observed increase in nuclear p65. In the case of c-Rel, again very little protein is evident in the nuclei of unstimulated cells or at 10 min. However, by 30 min to 1 h, nuclear c-Rel has increased to a level that, unlike p65, appears to be maintained up to 24 h. The level of cytoplasmic c-Rel seems relatively constant with only a slight dip observed at 1 h, corresponding to the peak in nuclear c-Rel levels. The amount of IκBα seen in the cytoplasm drops sharply at 30 min, with levels beginning to increase again at 1 h, peaking at 2–4 h, and reaching preinduction levels by 24 h. This peak in IκBα expression corresponds to a peak in IκBα mRNA levels at 1 h (data not shown). Nuclear levels of IκBα in Western analysis were found to be low and constant, confirming breakdown and re-synthesis of cytoplasmic IκBα rather than translocation. These data are consistent with the proposal that IκBα is proteolyzed after induction of the NFκB system, releasing the NFκB proteins, which then translocate to the nucleus (10Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 19Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. J. Biol.

An NFκB element in the IκBα promoter (25Le Bail O. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1993; 15: 5043-5049Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar) directs the increase in IκBα levels at later time points. Nuclear extracts prepared from THP-1 cells stimulated with LPS through a 24-h time course were used to analyze the identity of complex II in supershift assays (Fig. 5). In stimulated and unstimulated cells, complex II is completely supershifted by an antibody against JunD (Fig. 5 A). An unidentified complex that seems to have a slightly higher mobility than complex II becomes evident when complex II is supershifted by anti-JunD. Antibodies specific for c-Jun and ATF-2 have no observable effect on complex II. The effect of an antibody against JunB was also investigated with negative results (data not shown). Further supershifts with antibodies against Fos proteins were also carried out. In the absence of LPS, complex II is completely supershifted by a broadly reactive Fos antibody. Anti-Fra-2, although not producing an observable supershift, does significantly decrease the intensity of complex II. Anti-c-Fos has no effect. This situation remains the same following LPS stimulation of up to 24 h. The effects of antibodies against FosB and Fra-1 were also analyzed with negative results (data not shown). Our data show complex II to be a JunD/Fra-2 heterodimer both before and after LPS stimulation of up to 24 h. The residual complex II observed in the presence of anti-Fra-2 may either be because of the antibody having a relatively low affinity for Fra-2 or because of the presence of an as yet unidentified Fos-related protein that forms a dimer with JunD. Supershift assays with the AP1 distal site oligonucleotide demonstrated the binding of both JunD/Fra-2 and JunD/c-Fos heterodimers with no change in the components of the complex through the 24-h time course (data not shown). These data suggest slight differences in binding at the two adjacent AP1 sites. In the absence of a significant quantitative change in binding to the proximal AP1 site through the 24-h time course (see Fig. 2 A), we examined whether there was a change in the phosphorylation state of JunD. Supershift assays (Fig. 6) were carried out using anti-JunD alone or in combination with an antibody specific for JunD phosphorylated at Ser-100 (c-Jun phosphorylated at Ser-73, a conserved site, is also recognized). In the absence of LPS, complex II is supershifted with anti-JunD, with the addition of the phospho-specific Jun antibody (α-p-Jun) having little effect. At 30 min to 1 h of LPS stimulation, the anti-phospho-Jun antibody caused a further shift in the anti-JunD supershift (supershift I), producing a lower mobility complex (supershift II). The amount of observable “supershift II” is considerably reduced at periods of LPS incubation of 2 h and longer. These data indicate that the majority of the JunD bound to the AP1PκB oligonucleotide is not phosphorylated at its transactivation domain (Ser-100) in the absence of LPS, but with LPS induction of up to 1 h, transient phosphorylation occurs. The presence of phosphorylated JunD at 30 min to 1 h of LPS stimulation was confirmed by Western blot analyses using the phospho-specific Jun antibody (data not shown). We also analyzed the activation state of SAPK/JNK, whose downstream targets include JunD. The data indicate no change in the levels of nuclear or cytoplasmic SAPK/JNK (Fig. 7,A and C) but clearly show activation by phosphorylation at the Thr-183/Tyr-185 residues beginning at 10 min and peaking at 30 min to 1 h (Fig. 7, B and D). The activation of SAPK/JNK directly reflects the appearance of phosphorylated JunD. LPS activation of monocytes and monocytic THP-1 cells produces a transient increase in the levels of TF mRNA and TF antigen and activity (8Gregory S.A. Morrisey J.H. Edgington T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2752-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 9Brand K. Fowler B.J. Edgington T.S. Mackman N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4732-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our data charting these levels in THP-1 cells through a 24-h time course show a correlation to previous reports, with a rapid induction of TF mRNA from 30 min to 1 h of LPS stimulation and TF antigen levels peaking at 2 h. When we examined the TF gene promoter LRE in DNA binding studies, we found the transient binding of an NFκB complex and the constitutive binding of AP1 complexes. The NFκB complex was observed to bind the LRE site from at least 30 min up to 2 h of LPS stimulation and was found to contain p65 and c-Rel in a heterodimeric complex. The TF LRE NFκB-like sequence has been shown to be an optimal site for the binding of p65 and c-Rel but not p50 (26Oeth P.A. Parry G.C.N. Kunsch C. Nantermet P. Rosen C.A. Mackman N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of previous reports studying this NFκB complex identified its component proteins as p65 and c-Rel, in agreement with our data (26Oeth P.A. Parry G.C.N. Kunsch C. Nantermet P. Rosen C.A. Mackman N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A different study, however, suggested that an Ets transcription factor is binding to the core sequence of the κB-like site upon LPS stimulation rather than an NFκB complex. We found no evidence of Ets proteins binding to this site using an antibody against Ets 1/2 in supershift assays (data not shown). To confirm the predicted model of NFκB activation, we compared nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts for evidence of nuclear translocation. Our data show the proteolysis of the cytoplasmic inhibitory protein IκBα and the translocation of both p65 and c-Rel from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, corresponding to the appearance of the NFκB complex in gel shift studies. An earlier study charting the nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of the NFκB proteins in THP-1 cells (19Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11803-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that p65 was present in the nucleus before LPS induction, with levels increasing on stimulation and continuing to be elevated for up to 24 h. This contrasts with our data, where p65 was not detected before stimulation and only translocated to the nucleus for a very short period (up to 2 h), corresponding to the appearance of NFκB complexes in the binding studies and the transiently elevated levels of TF gene transcription. This same study, in agreement with our data, observed the rapid nuclear translocation of c-Rel with elevated levels persisting for up to 24 h. The fact that c-Rel is present at these longer periods of LPS stimulation yet does not appear to bind the TF κB-like site suggests that either this site is specific for the binding of p65/c-Rel heterodimers and not c-Rel homodimers or that the DNA binding capacity of c-Rel is subject to regulation. A recent study demonstrated that IκBα may also regulate the transcriptional activity of c-Rel in the nuclear compartment (28Luque I. Gelinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and other studies have shown that the DNA binding capacity of certain NFκB proteins may be controlled by redox mechanisms (29Suzuki Y.J. Mizuno M. Tritschler H.J. Packer L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 241-246PubMed Google Scholar) or at the level of phosphorylation (30Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 31Hayashi T. Sekine T. Okamoto T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32606-32612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The EMSA data also suggest that the affinity of p65/c-Rel for the κB-like site is considerably increased if the proximal AP1 site is present. Although this effect has not been quantitated in our study, comparison of the binding to the AP1PκB oligonucleotide and the isolated TFκB oligonucleotide showed that much longer exposure times were required to observe complexes with TFκB than with AP1PκB (Fig. 3, lanes 11–20 and1–10, respectively, probes labeled to similar specific activities). Because under these conditions multiprotein-DNA complexes, which might involve protein-protein interactions, were not observed, the effect appears to lie in the structural influence of the DNA itself. Although this effect may be a result of the size of the oligonucleotides used and the position of the transcription factor binding sites relative to the ends of the oligonucleotides, it may also be a result of adjacent sequence influencing binding characteristics. A recent study demonstrated such a structural role for the AP1 sites in the TF promoter when their replacement by intrinsically bent DNA was able to partially restore LPS induction (12Oeth P. Parry G.C.N. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The AP1 sites of the LRE are essential for LPS induction, with mutation of either site compromising LPS inducibility (10Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 12Oeth P. Parry G.C.N. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). AP1 is a dimer of proteins of the Fos/Jun family. Jun proteins are able to bind to DNA as homodimers or as Fos/Jun heterodimers. Fos proteins, however, are obliged to form heterodimers to bind (33Vogt P.K. Bos T.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 55: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 34Ransone L.J. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Previous studies analyzing the composition of the LRE-bound AP1 complexes in THP-1 cells report differing binding profiles at these sites. Oeth et al. (12Oeth P. Parry G.C.N. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) looked at the two AP1 sites in isolation in THP-1 cells and found c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers both pre- and post-LPS stimulation, with the amount of protein binding exhibiting some increase after stimulation; these results are consistent with the constitutive expression of c-Jun and c-Fos in human monocytes and their induction in response to LPS (35Dokter W.H.A. Esselink M.T. Halie M.R. Vellenga E. Blood. 1993; 81: 337-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second study in THP-1 cells (11Groupp E.R. Donovan-Peluso M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) used a larger oligonucleotide containing the entire LRE with an additional downstream Sp1 site and found LPS induction of c-Jun binding. c-Fos/JunD heterodimers were found preinduction, whereas following LPS stimulation, both c-Fos/JunD and c-Fos/c-Jun complexes were observed. Our data examining AP1 LRE binding through a 24-h time course of LPS induction shows a relatively constant degree of AP1 binding to AP1PκB throughout the 24-h time course, although we have consistently observed a decrease in the amount of complex II at 4 h and a subsequent increase at 24 h (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with the study of Groupp and Donovan-Peluso (11Groupp E.R. Donovan-Peluso M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we find the majority of AP1 binding activity to contain JunD. In our study, JunD/Fra-2 bound at the proximal AP1 site (complex II), and both JunD/Fra-2 and JunD/c-Fos bound at the distal AP1 site, both at pre- and post-induction time points. The Jun proteins may be regulated in their DNA binding and transactivation activities by means of changes in their phosphorylation state. Phosphorylation of c-Jun at the C terminus by casein kinase II or glycogen synthase kinase 3 prevents DNA binding (36Nikolakaki E. Coffer P.J. Hemelsoet R. Woodgett J.R. Defize L.H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation at the N-terminal region (Ser-63/Ser-73) by the mitogen-activated protein kinase homologue SAPK/JNK enhances transcriptional activation. Ser-100 of JunD is a conserved phosphorylation site corresponding to Ser-73 of c-Jun and is also a target for SAPK/JNK (37Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar, 38Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). Because our data showed no significant change in the degree of AP1 binding or in the composition of the complexes, we examined evidence for the activation states of the Jun proteins by assessing the phosphorylation of the amino acids that influence their transactivation domains. Our data clearly show the transient (30 min to 1 h) phosphorylation of JunD in the JunD/Fra-2 complex bound to the proximal AP1 site (Fig. 6, lanes 6 and 9). The activation of SAPK/JNK, for which JunD is a target, directly correlates to the appearance of phosphorylated JunD. Although only a small proportion of the cellular JunD is phosphorylated when examined by Western blot analysis (data not shown), gel mobility shift assays indicate that a high proportion of the proximal AP1 site-bound JunD is phosphorylated (Fig. 6), raising the question as to whether there may be some form of coordinated regulation of DNA binding and transactivation enhancement. Although we did not assess the phosphorylation state of JunD bound to the distal AP-1 site, it seems probable that it, too, is phosphorylated at the transactivation domain upon LPS stimulation. Our evaluation of transcription factor binding to the TF gene promoter LRE throughout a 24-h time course of LPS induction demonstrates a number of regulatory features (Fig. 8). These include the transient, inducible binding of a p65/c-Rel heterodimer to the TF κB-like site (30 min to 2 h) corresponding to the proteolysis of IκBα and the nuclear translocation of p65 and c-Rel as predicted by previously proposed models of NFκB activation (10Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 19Cordle S.R. Donald R. Read M.A. Hawiger J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1361-1369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the transient phosphorylation (30 min to 1 h) of JunD bound to the proximal AP1 site, reflecting the appearance of phospho-JunD in nuclear extracts. JunD is a target for SAPK/JNK, which we have demonstrated is activated by phosphorylation for this same period. The transient nature of the NFκB translocation and binding of p65/c-Rel to the TFκB-like site and of the activation of SAPK/JNK and phosphorylation of target AP1 proteins directly correlate with the observed transient increases in TF mRNA in LPS-induced THP-1 cells through the 24-h time course."

Here we demonstrate the serum-stimulated co-isolation of the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) with the eIF4F complex. This apparent interaction of PABP with eIF4F suggests that a mechanism shown to be important in the control of translation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also operates in vertebrate cells. We also present evidence that the signaling pathways modulating eIF4E phosphorylation and function inXenopus kidney cells differ from those in several mammalian cell types studied previously. Experiments with the immunosuppressant rapamycin suggest that the mTOR signaling pathway is involved in serum-promoted eIF4E phosphorylation and association with eIF4G. Moreover, we could find little evidence for regulation of eIF4E function via interaction with the specific binding proteins 4E-BP1 or 4E-BP2 in these cells. Although rapamycin abrogated serum-enhanced rates of protein synthesis and the interaction of eIF4G with eIF4E, it did not prevent the increase in association of eIF4G with PABP. This suggests that serum stimulates the interaction between eIF4G and PABP by a distinct mechanism that is independent of both the mTOR pathway and the enhanced association of eIF4G with eIF4E.

The cap structure present at the 5′-end of mRNA facilitates its binding to the ribosome, a process mediated by at least three initiation factors (eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F)1 and ATP hydrolysis. eIF4F is a cap-binding protein complex composed of three polypeptides; eIF4E, which specifically recognizes the cap structure, eIF4A, a single strand RNA-binding protein with helicase activity (9Pause A.

It is believed that eIF4F functions to unwind secondary structure in the mRNA 5′-untranslated region to facilitate binding to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (4Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-44Google Scholar). Recent studies in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae have indicated that a further association occurs between eIF4G and poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1p), which binds to the 3′ poly(A) tail of mRNA. This interaction allows functional interaction of the 5′- and 3′-ends of the mRNAs that is essential for transmitting the stimulatory signal of the poly(A) tail on translation to the cap structure (8Morley S.J.

Increased levels of eIF4E phosphorylation have been directly correlated with the enhancement of translation that follows mitogenic stimulation of mammalian cells (1Morley S.J. Clemens M.J.

Another important mechanism regulating the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G is exerted by the eIF4E-binding proteins 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (PHAS-I and PHAS-II). In resting cells, 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 are hypophosphorylated and bound to eIF4E (7Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control.

Stimulation of cells with growth factors or hormones increases the phosphorylation of these eIF4E-binding proteins to disrupt their association with eIF4E, liberating eIF4E to interact with a conserved hydrophobic region of eIF4G. A similar sequence found in 4E-BP1 is involved in binding to eIF4E and competes with eIF4G for eIF4E binding (33Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Insight into the signaling pathways regulating the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1/BP2 has been provided by the use of the immunosuppressant, rapamycin (34Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 35Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This drug binds to its cytosolic receptor (FK-506-binding protein), which then interacts with and inhibits the activity of a protein known variously as RAFT-1/FRAP/RAPT-1 or mTOR (36Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this, rapamycin causes the selective inhibition of two parallel signaling pathways downstream of mTOR; the p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) signaling pathway and the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (36Brown E.J.

In contrast, rapamycin does not prevent the phosphorylation of eIF4E during the early phases of T cell activation (26Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Biochem.

Using Xenopus kidney cells in culture, we have utilized rapamycin to examine the signal transduction pathways involved in the enhanced phosphorylation of eIF4E, its recruitment into eIF4F complexes, and its association with other initiation factors. In contrast to the situation with the mammalian cells described above, rapamycin prevented the serum-stimulated increase in eIF4E phosphorylation in these cells. Although rapamycin inhibited eIF4F complex formation, this did not appear to be due to stabilization of the interaction of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 or 4E-BP2. In addition, we show that serum stimulated the association between eIF4G and PABP via a rapamycin-insensitive pathway. These data indicate that multiple signaling pathways converge at the level of eIF4F complex formation to influence the interactions between eIF4E, eIF4G, and PABP during the stimulation of cell growth.

Biochem. 1992; 205: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were grown in 10-cm dishes at room temperature (20–24 °C), containing 60% Leibovitz l-15 medium, 30% H2O, 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For serum starvation, cultures were incubated with 0.5% fetal calf serum for 24 h prior to treatment with serum (10%), as described in individual figure legends. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h in phosphate-free Leibovitzl-15 medium and incubated with [32P]orthophosphate (200 μCi/ml) for 2 h prior to treatment with serum (10%). Extracts were prepared as described below. Cultures were placed on ice, and cells were scraped into 1 ml of Buffer A (80 mmβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm benzamidine), isolated by centrifugation, washed in the same buffer, and lysed by the addition of 200 μl Buffer B (10 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 μm microcystin, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (by volume) Triton X-100, 1% (by volume) sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mmNaF, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmbenzamidine, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Following a 5-min incubation on ice with occasional vortexing, extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 rpm in a cooled microcentrifuge. The supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Serum-starved cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and 10% fetal calf serum in complete medium for the times indicated. Cells were recovered and washed twice in Buffer A, prior to lysis in 0.3 m NaOH. Incorporation of radioactivity into protein was determined by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. One-dimensional polyacrylamide gels and vertical slab isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis were carried out as described previously (27Morley S.J. McKendrick L. J. Biol.

Following the transfer of proteins to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane, the presence of eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A, PABP, eIF2α, 4E-BP1, and 4E-BP2 was detected with specific antisera, as described in the individual figure legends. For specific analysis of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2, total cell extract was boiled for 8 min, the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (29Lin T.-A.

For the isolation of eIF4E and associated proteins, cell extracts of equal protein concentration were subjected to m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography, the resin was washed three times with Buffer C (50 mm Mops/KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmEGTA, 1 μm microcystin, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 2 mmbenzamidine, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmGTP), and recovered protein was eluted directly into sample buffer for either SDS-PAGE or VSIEF, prior to analysis (25Morley S.J.

In a similar manner, to directly isolate PABP and associated proteins, cell extracts were subjected to affinity chromatography using poly(A)-Sepharose, and the resin washed in Buffer C prior to elution with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitation of eIF4G and associated proteins from cell extracts was as described previously, except the resin was washed five times (with 1 ml of buffer each time) (27Morley S.J.

Bloomberg, Department of Biochemistry, University of Bristol, United Kingdom) and affinity-purified on the same peptide. In all cases, detection was within the linear response of the antiserum to the protein. In several mammalian cell systems, it has been possible to show that physiological stimulation of protein synthesis and cell growth results in parallel enhancement of the phosphorylation of eIF4E and eIF4G (23Bu X.

Cell Physiol. 1997; 272: C754-C759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine this relationship further, we have analyzed the activation of protein synthesis in Xenopus kidney cells in culture, using a cell line well established for studies of serum stimulation of both general translation and of specific translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (41Loreni F. Amaldi F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Relative to control cells, addition of serum resulted in a 20% increase in the rate of total protein synthesis within 30 min, reaching a 40% increase by 3 h (Fig.1 A). Consistent with previous studies with this cell line (41Loreni F. Amaldi F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the early activation of protein synthesis was accompanied by a significant increase in the proportion of ribosomes in polysomes (data not shown). This modest effect on the translation rate at early times after stimulation is similar in extent to that reported for insulin-stimulated (39Flynn A. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 46Kimball S.R. Jurasinski C.V. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 3418-3426PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of serum on the phosphorylation of eIF4E, extracts were prepared from control or stimulated cells, and the level of phosphorylation was directly monitored by immunoblotting using a phosphospecific antiserum; the recovery of eIF4E was monitored using antiserum that recognizes eIF4E irrespective of its phosphorylation status (24Morley S.J. Rau M. Kay J.E. Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1751-1760PubMed Google Scholar, 27Morley S.J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 418: 327-332Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, serum stimulation resulted in a 40% increase in the phosphorylation of total eIF4E, which was maximal within 30 min. Because Xenopus cells contain two distinct forms of eIF4E (25Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1751-1760PubMed Google Scholar, 50Wakiyama M. Saigoh M. Shiokawa K. Miura K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we have analyzed the phosphorylation of these independently following m7GTP-Sepharose affinity purification, VSIEF, and immunoblotting (Fig. 1 C). With this system, for each form of the protein, the more phosphorylated eIF4E variant is the upper immunoreactive band (25Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1751-1760PubMed Google Scholar, 27Morley S.J. McKendrick L. J. Biol.

Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8983-8990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These data show that the addition of serum resulted in a 50% increase in the total phosphorylation of eIF4E within 30 min; the proportion of eIF4E in the phosphorylated form did not increase any further upon prolonged incubation of the cells (data not shown). In most experiments, the enhancement of phosphorylation was similar for both forms of eIF4E, but in some cases the effect on phosphorylation of the upper form (resolved by VSIEF) was greater (see Fig.2 A). The data on overall eIF4E phosphorylation were confirmed by prelabeling of cells with [32P]orthophosphate; extracts were prepared from starved and serum-stimulated cells, and eIF4E and associated proteins were isolated by affinity chromatography. Serum induced greater than a 50% increase in the phosphate labeling of total eIF4E, without affecting the amount of eIF4E protein present in the cell (Fig. 1 D). By virtue of its association with eIF4E, eIF4G was also recovered following m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography. Following this step, an 80% increase in the phosphate labeling of eIF4G recovered in association with eIF4E was observed (Fig. 1 D). Although we have observed modest increases in the phosphorylation of total cellular eIF4G following serum stimulation (data not shown), the results presented here mainly reflect the enhanced recovery of eIF4G protein associated with eIF4E following serum activation of cells (see Fig.3 A). Conversely, by comparing the signals on Western immunoblots probed with antisera recognizing either total or phosphorylated eIF2α, we have been able to demonstrate that serum stimulation caused a reduction in the phosphorylation of this factor (Fig. 1 E).Figure 2Rapamycin abrogates the serum-induced phosphorylation of eIF4E in Xenopuskidney cells. A, serum-starved B3.2 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of rapamycin (50 nm) for 1 h, prior to the addition of serum (10%). Following a 30-min incubation, extracts were prepared and adjusted to equal protein concentration, and total eIF4E was isolated by m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography prior to analysis by VSIEF and immunoblotting with anti-eIF4E antiserum. In a parallel culture, cells were prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described in Fig. 1 Dprior to incubation in the absence or presence of serum (10%) and rapamycin (50 nm).

Here we report that trypsin-fragmented mouse IP3R1 (mIP3R1) retains significant inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) binding activity that is comparable to the intact receptor in affinity, capacity, and specificity. This is despite the fact that the IP3-binding core (residues 226–578), which is close to the minimum for high affinity binding, is completely split into two tryptic fragments at the Arg-343 and/or Arg-345, around the center of the core. Furthermore, we have examined whether binding activity could be complemented in vitro by mixing two distinct glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, which were respectively composed of residues 1–343 and 341–604, almost corresponding to two split binding components, and separately expressed in Escherichia coli. The GST-fused residues 1–343 (GN) showed no binding affinity for IP3, whereas the GST-fused residues 341–604 (GC) displayed weak but definite activity with an affinity >100-fold lower than that of the native receptor. Upon mixing of both GN and GC, a high affinity site comparable to the native site appeared. We suggest that the IP3-binding pocket consists of two non-covalently but tightly associated structural domains each of which has a discrete function: the C-terminal domain alone has low affinity for IP3, whereas the N-terminal one alone is incapable of binding but is capable of potentiating binding affinity.

It is 2749 amino acids long (molecular mass about 313 kDa) and is structurally divided into three parts as follows: a large N-terminal cytoplasmic arm region (residues 1–2275), a putative six membrane-spanning region clustered near the C terminus (residues 2276–2589) which is thought to constitute an ion channel by forming a tetramer, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail region (residues 2590–2749) (11Michikawa T.

The minimum region for high affinity binding has been localized within the 353 residues, 226–578, so that it appears to be close to the binding “core.” Within the core region, we have identified 10 important basic amino acid residues all of which are well conserved in all IP3R family proteins cloned to date: three (Arg-265, Lys-508, and Arg-511) are critical and the other seven are required for specific binding. Nahorski and Potter (7Nahorski R. Potter B.V.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 139-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) predicted that ionic interactions of positive charges on a binding site with negative charges on the three phosphate groups of IP3would make major contributions to specific recognition and binding. Thus, we have proposed that the IP3-binding core forms a pocket with a positively charged inner surface lining of these basic residues which recognizes and binds a negatively charged IP3 ligand. Interestingly, all members of the IP3R family share extensive homology in the core sequence, except that the IP3R1 has an alternative splicing SI region (15 residues, 318–332) (9Mignery G.A.

Recently, we have shown that limited trypsin digestion of mouse cerebellar membrane fractions causes fragmentation of the mIP3R1 into five major trypsin-resistant polypeptides and that these five tryptic fragments I–V have tight structural-functional coupling because of the following: (i) co-sedimentation of all four cytoplasmic peripheral fragments I–IV (40/37, 64, 76, and 40/36 kDa) together with the membrane-spanning integral fragment V (91 kDa) by centrifugation to pellet membrane proteins and immunoprecipitation with C terminal-specific antibody, and (ii) retention of IP3-induced Ca2+ release channel activity in such fragmented mIP3R1. As a result of trypsinization, the IP3-binding region is cleaved at the carboxyl side of Arg-343 and/or Arg-345, around which is the alternative splicing SI region, into two polypeptides: fragments I and II. These results have demonstrated that the native IP3-binding region consists of two major tightly folded structural components connected by one exposed loop near the SI region; the latter loop is very susceptible to trypsin attack, whereas the former two components are not. Similarly, fragments III, IV, and V would be reflected by well folded conformation of the native mIP3R1 channel. Thus, determination of the structure-function relationships among these components might clarify the molecular mechanism of ligand binding and channel opening of the mIP3R1 channel. In the present study, we describe the structure-function relationships of the split tryptic IP3-binding region. We have characterized the IP3 binding properties of trypsin-fragmented mIP3R1, and we have demonstrated that the tryptic mIP3R1, completely fragmented into five polypeptides, still retains specific IP3 binding activity comparable to that of the intact receptor. To analyze further the split IP3 binding components, we have separately synthesized two glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins with these two components, and we have shown that high affinity binding site can be reconstituted in vitro by complementation with both distinct fusion proteins, each of which alone has no (N-terminal component) or low affinity (C-terminal component) binding. From these data, we propose that the functional structure of the IP3-binding pocket consists of two well folded structural domains that are non-covalently but tightly associated and a diverse loop-like structure between these two domains.

Site-specific anti-mIP3R1 antibodies (polyclonal antibodies N1, N3, anti-(1718–31), and 1ML1; monoclonal antibodies 10A6 and 18A10) have been described (18Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T.

The cerebella were homogenized by 10 strokes (850 rpm) in an ice-chilled glass Teflon Potter homogenizer containing 9 volumes of 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μmleupeptin, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was re-centrifuged under the same conditions to completely remove P1 fraction. The second supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min at 2 °C. The precipitate (crude microsome) was resuspended with binding buffer (1 mmEDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0 (at 4 °C)) to give a final concentration of about 15 mg/ml protein, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a reference. Microsomal fraction (1 mg/ml protein) was incubated with the desired concentration of trypsin at 35 °C in trypsinizing buffer (120 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The reaction was quenched with 10-fold weight excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.1 mm PMSF. IP3 binding was carried out by incubating sample protein with 9.6 nm (or 4.8 nm for Scatchard analysis of microsomal fraction) [3H]IP3 in 100 μl of binding buffer for 10 min at 4 °C. The IP3/protein mixture was added to 4 μl of γ-globulin (50 mg/ml) and 100 μl of PEG precipitation buffer (30% (w/v) PEG6000, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C) and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein-PEG complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 18,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in 180 μl of Solvable and then neutralized by adding 18 μl of acetic acid. The radioactivity of the neutralized samples was measured by mixing 5 ml of Atomlight followed by counting in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). The specific binding was defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding that was measured in the presence of 2–100 μm cold IP3. In Scatchard plots, lines were fit to the data by the least squares method using either the single site relationship B/F = −B/K d +B max/K d or the two-site relationship B/F =B max1/(K d1+ F) +B max2/(K d2+ F) as appropriate, where B is the specific IP3 binding in pmol/mg protein, F is the concentration of the free IP3, K d is dissociation constant for each separate site, andB max represents the maximal number of binding sites for each site (16Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Standard methods (PCR, cloning, and DNA sequencing) for construction of the mIP3R1 cDNA-derived plasmids were as described previously (14Yoshikwa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). DNA clones derived from PCR products were all confirmed by sequencing. To generate fusion constructs between GST and the IP3-binding region of mIP3R1, foreign nucleotide fragments as described below were attached to the mIP3R1 cDNA by PCR using appropriately designed primers. A BamHI site (GGATCC) was attached at the 5′ terminus of the initiation codon (ATG) of the mIP3R1 for the GST-fused residue 1–343 (GN and GN(R265Q)) and at the 5′ terminus of Arg-341 codon for the GST-fused residues 341–604 (GC), and TAAGAATTC (stop codon + EcoRI site) was attached at the 3′ terminus of Arg-343 codon for the GN and GN(R265Q) and at the 3′ terminus of Arg-604 codon for the GC. A fragment including the R265Q mutation was amplified using the R265Q mutant (14Yoshikwa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) as a template. Each genetically worked fragment coding the residues 1–343 (for GN), 1–343(R265Q) (for GN(R265Q)) and 341–604 (for GC) was digested byBamHI and EcoRI, and the resultant restriction fragment was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI site of the GST fusion vector pGEX-2T. Escherichia coli JM109 strain was transformed with these expression constructs, and recombinant fusion proteins were expressed by the low temperature method that was developed to increase solubility of expressed IP3-binding proteins as described previously (14Yoshikwa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and disrupted by sonication on ice. After centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 60 min at 2 °C, the supernatants were collected and subjected to a GST purification step through glutathione-Sepharose 4B column chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purified GST fusion proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and IP3 binding assay. We previously showed that limited trypsin digestion of mouse cerebellar membrane fractions fragmented the mIP3R1 into five major polypeptides (fragments I–V), in which the IP3-binding region was split into two fragments I and II (18Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, these completely fragmented mIP3R1 still retained strong activity for IP3-induced Ca2+ release comparable with that of the intact receptor, suggesting that even the split IP3-binding site was sufficient to couple with gating the fragmented channel. To characterize further the structural and functional properties of the split IP3-binding site, we analyzed the mIP3R1 in trypsin-digested and undigested microsomal fractions of mouse cerebellum for specificity, affinity, and capacity of IP3binding. Microsomal fractions were digested with 5 μg/ml trypsin for 4 min at 35 °C and then pelleted by centrifugation. Almost all of the tryptic fragments as well as the intact mIP3R1 collected into the pellet. The pellet was solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 60 min at 2 °C to obtain the supernatant. The Triton extracts were then subjected to Western blot analysis using six site-specific antibodies, which specifically recognize the major tryptic fragments Ia/b (40/37 kDa), II (64 kDa), III (76 kDa), IVa/b (40/36 kDa), and V (91 kDa) (18Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, trypsinization resulted in complete fragmentation of the mIP3R1 into five tryptic fragments that were detectable with the site-specific antibodies (Trypsin +), but when pre-mixed with 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor and 0.1 mm PMSF prior to the digestion, no apparent mobility change was observed in the intact mIP3R1 band (Trypsin −). The IVa/b fragments were only detected at very low levels, since the epitope for anti-(1718–31) located in the alternative splicing SII region (40 residues 1692–1731) of these fragments is most labile to trypsinolysis (18Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The size difference between the Ia and Ib fragments has been thought to be due to alternative splicing at the SI region (15 residues 318–332), the former derived from the SI+ subtype and the latter from the SI− subtype (15Nakagawa T. Okano H. Furuichi T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 18Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). By using the Triton extracts containing these tryptic fragments, the following [3H]IP3-binding experiments were carried out. Although the IP3-binding core was completely separated into two fragments I and II, which were recognized by the N1 and N3 antibodies, respectively (Fig. 1 A), the fragmented mIP3R1 (Trypsin +) still retained specific IP3 binding activity equivalent to that of the intact receptor (Trypsin −) (Fig. 1 B). In [3H]IP3 binding competition experiments with various inositol phosphates, the fragmented mIP3R1 (Trypsin +) showed comparable ligand binding specificity to the intact receptor (Trypsin −) in the order of (1,4,5)IP3 > (2,4,5)IP3 > (1,3,4,5)IP4 (Fig.2 A). Scatchard analysis showed that the capacity for IP3 was unaffected by trypsin digestion; the B max (pmol/mg protein) was 23 for the fragmented mIP3R1 (Trypsin +) and 22 for the intact receptor (Trypsin −) (Fig. 2 B). In addition, the affinity for IP3 (K dvalue) was also comparable between the fragmented mIP3R1 (13 nm) and the intact receptor (19 nm). These results suggested that a rigid folded conformation of the tetrameric mIP3R1 complex in the native membrane might preserve its inherent IP3-binding pocket from trypsin digestion, even though the IP3-binding core was split into two near the center. Most IP3 binding activity and fragments I and II were collected in an insoluble membrane fraction upon mild trypsin digestion, whereas a proportion of these fragments became soluble upon more extensive digestion. We next examined the temporal profile of IP3binding activity in relation to increasing time of digestion (Fig.3). Microsomal fractions were treated with 10 μg/ml trypsin for 0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 min and were separated in insoluble and soluble fractions by centrifugation at 105,000 ×g for 60 min. The pelleted insoluble fractions were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 to obtain Triton extract. An equivalent volume of the soluble fraction (sup) and the Triton extract of insoluble fraction (ppt) were subjected to [3H]IP3 binding (Fig. 3 A) and Western blotting assay (Fig. 3 B). As the digestion time with trypsin was extended to 10 min, both the insoluble and soluble fraction showed a sharp difference in temporal changes of IP3binding activity; the former exhibited gradual attenuation, whereas the latter showed a gradual increase. When the digestion time was extended to beyond 20 min, no more marked changes were observed. These temporal profiles appear to parallel the immunoblotting patterns (Fig.3 B); as the digestion time was extended to 10 min, the levels of the Ia/b and II fragments, containing the epitopes for the N1 and N3, respectively, were decreased in the insoluble fraction but increased in the soluble fraction, and thereafter (at 20 and 40 min) no apparent change was seen in both fractions. However, more extensive digestion caused loss of binding activity and of these immunoreactive fragments (data not shown). These data indicated that the two tryptic Ia/b and II fragments were tightly associated with the tryptic mIP3R1-membrane complex and that some portions released by the prolonged digestions appeared to retain conformation for specific binding by interaction between fragments. To examine the functional interaction between the two tryptic fragments I and II containing the split IP3-binding core, we tried to express recombinant proteins corresponding to these fragments in anE. coli system. However, it was difficult to obtain sufficient amounts of soluble proteins, especially for the fragment II (data not shown). To solve this, we constructed GST fusion proteins as shown in Fig. 4. The GN was composed of GST fused to the N-terminal residues 1–343, corresponding to almost the entire fragment I. We previously showed that Arg-265 within the IP3-binding core is one of three basic amino acid residues for which Gln substitutions (R265Q) caused a complete loss of binding activity (14Yoshikwa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The GN(R265Q) had this R265Q mutation in the GN construct. The GC consisted of a GST fusion protein with residues 341–604, corresponding to almost all of the N-terminal 29-kDa subfragment derived from fragment II, which took place upon extensive trypsinolysis (18Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These GST fusion proteins were expressed inE. coli and were purified through a glutathione column (Fig.5 A). [3H]IP3 binding assay showed that neither GN nor GN(R265Q) alone had any significant binding activity, whereas the GC alone showed some traces of activity (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Complementation of the IP3binding activity by two separately expressed GST-fused IP3-binding domains. A, SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant GST-fused IP3-binding domains. Two μg of GST fusion proteins, GN, GN(R265Q) and GC, and GST (see Fig. 4) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Sizes of molecular makers in kDa are shown in theright. B, specific [3H]IP3 (9.6 nm) binding to the GST fusion proteins. IP3 binding of GST fusion proteins (7 μg) were individually analyzed: GST, GN,GN(R265Q), and GC. Two GST fusion proteins were mixed (7 + 7 μg), and then the IP3 binding activity of the mixtures was analyzed: GN+GC, GN(R265Q)+GC,GST+GC, GN+GST, and GN(R265Q)+GST. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 2 μmIP3. Values are the mean ± S.D. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether the two split components worked cooperatively to bind IP3, we performed a complementation test by which two of these separately synthesized proteins were simply mixed in vitro (right half of Fig. 5 B). The combinations of GN + GST, GC + GST, GN(R265Q) + GST, and GN(R265Q) + GC had no significant change in [3H]IP3 binding. In marked contrast, the combination of GN + GC displayed a dramatic increase in the specific binding activity, suggesting that the GN and the GC complemented each other to retrieve IP3 binding activity, even though both have a large extra GST moiety at the N terminus. To characterize further this structural and functional reconstitution of an IP3-binding site by mixing two separately synthesized GN and GC, we carried out Scatchard analysis as shown in Fig.6. The GN alone exhibited no binding activity as the control GST. On the other hand, the GC alone could form a very low affinity site with K d value of 4.7 μm. It was of particular interest that the mixture of GN + GC displayed a plot fitted by two binding sites; the low affinity site appeared to be consistent with that of the GC alone, and the high affinity site had a K d value of 11 nm, about 400-fold lower than that of the low affinity site and comparable to that of the intact mIP3R1. Judging from theB max value of 40 pmol/mg protein, it was estimated that about 2% of the total GC (about 1800 pmol/mg of protein) was involved in reconstitution of this high affinity site by complementation with the GN. Mild trypsin digestion of a cerebellar membrane fraction generates five major tryptic fragments, including the N-terminal two fragments Ia/b (40/37 kDa) and II (64 kDa), that share the entire IP3-binding site and are tightly associated with the insoluble membrane fraction (18Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that the trypsinized IP3-binding site of mIP3R1 retains significant affinity, specificity, and binding capacity for IP3, comparable to those of the intact one. These results indicate that the trypsinized IP3-binding site may retain functional tertiary structure. Prolonged trypsinization caused concomitant loss of IP3 binding activity and release of fragments I and II from the insoluble mIP3R1-membrane complex to the soluble fractions. These results demonstrate that the folded conformation of the IP3-binding site is stably retained in either the insoluble or soluble form by a possible inter-fragment interaction. Joseph et al. (17Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) previously reported that prolonged trypsin digestions of rat cerebellar microsomes caused release of a 68-kDa fragment of IP3R with concomitant appearance of higher IP3 binding activity in the soluble fraction, whereas with mild digestion the 68-kDa fragment was retained in the membrane-bound insoluble form with lower activity. In the present study, however, we have shown that the affinity of the insoluble fraction from the mildly trypsinized samples is slightly higher than that of un-trypsinized samples. We consider that the 68-kDa fragment is likely to correspond to the 64-kDa fragment II identified in the present study and that the binding activity observed by Josephet al. (17Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) could be attributed to a native-like interaction between fragments I and II which are simultaneously released, although Joseph et al. (17Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) did not note fragment I in both the soluble and insoluble fractions. This discrepancy between our results and the previous study (17Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) may be due to differences in preparation of membrane fractions, trypsin digestions, and/or binding assays (filtration versus PEG precipitation). Neither the SI plus (mIP3R1SI+) nor minus (mIP3R1SI−) subtype showed any significant alteration in IP3 binding activity,2 whereas deletions of any other region within the IP3-binding core tested so far completely abolished the activity (12Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 13Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y. Yoshikawa S. Nakagawa T. Saitoh T. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), suggesting that the SI region is the only redundant part of the binding core. Arg-343 and Arg-345, which lie between fragments I and II and are close to the alternative splicing SI region (residues 318–332), are very susceptible to limited trypsinolysis. Within the IP3-binding core of all members of the IP3R family, the most divergent sequences are found around the SI region. Thus, we suggest that in the vicinity of the SI region, Arg-343 and Arg-345 may form a flexible loop-like structure (residues ∼318 to ∼345) that interconnects two non-covalently but tightly associated well folded structural components; “binding domains” I (residues 1 or N terminus to ∼317) andII (residues ∼346 to ∼923) corresponding to the trypsin-resistant fragments I and II, respectively (Fig.7). Residues 224–579 of the mIP3R1 expressed in E. coli which almost correspond to the IP3-binding core (residues 226–578) show specific and high affinity IP3binding activity, indicating that the binding core itself forms a functional structure (14Yoshikwa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We recently showed that more extensive trypsin digestion further split fragment II into two subfragments, an N-terminal 29-kDa and a C-terminal 38-kDa fragment, and that the carboxyl side of Arg-603 and/or Lys-604 would be the sites for this extensive trypsinization, which lie in the vicinity of the C-terminal boundary of the IP3-binding core (18Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that the IP3-binding core consists of two“core domains” I (at least residues ∼226 to ∼317) and II (residues ∼346 to ∼604) in the binding domains I and II, respectively (Fig. 7). The present study showed that the GST-fused N-terminal binding domain I (GN) had no significant binding activity, whereas the GST-fused C-terminal core domain II (GC) exhibited low affinity. Strikingly, simple mixing of these regions led to increased binding activity. TheK d value of this reconstituted high affinity IP3-binding site was almost comparable to that of the intact mIP3R1. These results suggested that the two separate GST fusion proteins mutually recognized and cooperatively formed a virtually native high affinity IP3-binding pocket. However, we could only reconstitute about 2% of the total input of the GC by just mixing the GN and the GC. This low rate of functional complementation may be due to physical interference by the N-terminal GST moiety attached to both fusion proteins, and/or due to low efficiency in direct interactions between GN and GC or in proper folding of expressed GN and GC, under the present conditions. The present study provides evidence for the modular construction of the IP3-binding region with discrete functional domains. We suggest that the low affinity core domain II is a prototypeof the IP3-binding structure (Fig. 7). The binding domain I, although it has no binding capacity by itself, could contribute to form a high affinity site cooperatively with the core domain II. Thus, the domain I seems to act as a “modulator” to potentiate the affinity of the IP3 binding prototype, core domain II. The functional property of this N-terminal binding domain I, however, is a little complicated as described previously (14Yoshikwa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); a short deletion of the N-terminal 31 amino acids from the N-terminal 734 amino acid region (T734) resulted in a significant reduction in the binding activity, although the resultant mutant included the entire IP3-binding core sequence. Such contradictory mutational effects were also found in serial N-terminal deletions up to residue 215. However, the authentic binding activity was markedly recovered, when deleted up to the first N-terminal 220, 223, or 225 amino acids, thereby indicating that the N-terminal boundary of IP3-binding core is at most residue 226. Notably, the mutant lacking the first N-terminal 223 amino acids showed more than 10-fold higher affinity for IP3 than that of the parental T734. Furthermore, a substitution of GST (26 kDa) for the first 223 amino acids of the N-terminal 604 amino acids (T604) significantly increased the affinity, as compared with the parental T604.2 These lines of peculiar evidence led us to hypothesize that the N-terminal first ∼225 amino acids are not directly responsible for the binding but are somewhat related to its suppression. Then, as shown in Fig. 7 we hypothesize that there are at least three functional modules, two modulators in the domain I (N-terminal suppressor and C-terminal enhancer(core domain I)) and one proto-IP3-binding site in the core domain II. Co-operative regulation among these modules for ligand binding may influence the channel gating. Mignery et al. (12Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) reported that the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of rat IP3R1 expressed in COS cells displayed an altered mobility (apparent decrease in mass of >50 kDa) on gel chromatography in the presence of IP3 and suggested that any conformational change induced upon binding to IP3 might be involved in coupling the ligand binding to the channel gating. We suppose that relative movement of the core domains I and II non-covalently associated with each other would occur upon ligand binding as described below. We previously demonstrated the significance of the 10 basic amino acid residues (Arg or Lys) in specific IP3 binding, all of which are well conserved within the IP3R family (14Yoshikwa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Of these, Arg-265, Lys-508, and Arg-511 are critical. We thus suggested that these 10 basic residues, especially Arg-265, Lys-508, and Arg-511, contribute to form a positively charged pocket for binding to the negative charges on the three phosphate groups of IP3. Four of them (Arg-241, Lys-249, Arg-265, and Arg-269) are positioned in the core domain I and the other six (Arg-504, Arg-506, Lys-508, Arg-511, Arg-568, and Lys-569) in the core domain II (Fig. 7). Thus, the IP3-binding pocket constituting two core domains may be relatively expanded due to repulsion among the positive charges on the inner surface in the nonligand-bound state (open) and become narrow due to neutralization of the positive charges by interactions with the negative charges on IP3 in the ligand-bound state (closed).

Blockade of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway in neutrophils with the NO synthase inhibitorN-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester or by treatment with the NO scavenger 2-phenyl-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide attenuated phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 in response to lipopolysaccharide but not fMet-Leu-Phe. Using the NO releasing agentsS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine and sodium nitroprusside it was determined that nitric oxide is sufficient to cause an increase in phosphorylation of p38. Increasing cellular cGMP with phosphodiesterase inhibitors, by stimulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase with YC-1 or with exogenous dibutyryl cGMP resulted in mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 3,6 (MEK3,6) activation and phosphorylation of p38. This phenomenon was specific for MEK3,6, because these agents had no effect on the phosphorylation state of MEK1,2. A role for protein kinase G but not protein kinase A downstream of lipopolysaccharide but not formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine was shown using the specific inhibitors KT5823 and H89, respectively. These data indicate that activation of p38 by fMet-Leu-Phe and lipopolysaccharide involve different mechanisms, and that activation of protein kinase G by NO-dependent stimulation of guanylyl cyclase is necessary and sufficient for phosphorylation of p38 downstream of lipopolysaccharide.

Detection of microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 andN-formyl peptides (fMLF) by neutrophils is an essential event that triggers the microbicidal functions of these cells. Activation of neutrophils by such stimuli results in chemotaxis to inflammatory sites, cytokine production, release of degradative granule enzymes, and generation of toxic oxygen intermediates. The MAP kinases are members of discrete signaling cascades that form focal points for diverse extracellular stimuli and function to regulate fundamental cellular processes. Three distinct classes within the MAP kinase family have been described, including ERK, c-jun-NH2 kinase, and p38, each having different physiological roles (1Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 5070-5078PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that challenge of neutrophils with LPS leads to activation of p38 but with slower kinetics than G-protein-coupled chemoattractant receptors (17Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nahas N. Molski T.F. Fernandez G.A. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism(s) leading to activation of ERK have been largely unraveled, but the regulation of components upstream of p38 remain to be clarified. Although recent reports have examined signaling downstream of fMLF, little attention has focused on the mechanism for LPS-mediated activation of p38 in neutrophils (18Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Furuya W. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Rane M.J. Carrithers S.L. Arthur J.M. Klein J.B. McLeish K.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5070-5078PubMed Google Scholar). In Jurkat T-cells, long-term exposure to nitric oxide (NO) leads to activation of several MAP kinases, with ERK being the most responsive (21Lander H.M. Jacovina A.T. Davis R.J. Tauras J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19705-19709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). LPS induces NO production in neutrophils, and this process is thought to mediate many of its inflammatory activities (22Numata M. Suzuki S. Miyazawa N. Miyashita A. Nagashima Y. Inoue S. Kaneko T.

Stimulation of neutrophils with fMLF can also induce NO production, which is thought to play an important role in chemotaxis and degranulation elicited by this agent (28Wyatt T.A. Lincoln T.M.

The mechanism of action for NO to regulate cell physiology is not clear; however, a key mediator is cGMP, which is generated by direct activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase. In this study we examined the role of NO in the activation of p38 MAP kinase by LPS and by fMLF in human neutrophils. It was found that NO formation is sufficient to cause phosphorylation of p38 and that its formation is a prerequisite to p38 activation by LPS but not by fMLF. Furthermore, it was found that the mechanism of action involves an increase in intracellular cGMP and possibly activation of protein kinase G. Inhibitors of the nitric oxide system, includingN-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, 2-phenyl-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide, and the NO releasing agents S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, sodium nitroprusside, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine, the phosphodiesterase inhibitors 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 4-(methylenedioxy)-benzylamino-6-methoxyquinazoline, RO-20-1724, and the protein kinase G inhibitor KT5823 were purchased from Calbiochem. The guanylyl cyclase stimulator YC-1 was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Dibutyryl cGMP and fMLF were from Sigma; LPS fromSalmonella Minnesota was purchased from Calbiochem. Rabbit anti-p38 serum was a generous gift from Dr. J. Han (Scripps Research Institute). All other antibodies, including those directed against the phosphorylated forms of MEK3,6, MEK1,2, and p38, were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) unless otherwise indicated. Neutrophils were prepared from the blood of healthy donors using Percoll gradient (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as published elsewhere (33Browning D.D. Pan Z.K. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7995-8001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, coagulation of the blood was prevented using citrate-dextrose during collection, and the erythrocytes were sedimented by adding 0.5 volume of 6% heta-starch (Abbott) at room temperature for ∼45 min. The erythrocyte-depleted supernatants were then layered on top of 55% isotonic Percoll containing a 74% cushion and centrifuged at 12 °C for 40 min. After collection of the granulocytes from the cushion interface, they were diluted 4-fold in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and washed twice by centrifugation at 500 × g. Neutrophils were then resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml and maintained at 37 °C. In experiments requiring pretreatment with inhibitors, cells were incubated in microtubes for 30 min (unless otherwise indicated) rotating at 37 °C. In all cases cells were pelleted and resuspended in 0.25 ml of the same medium, (in some cases the stimulating agents were added at this time), and the cells were incubated for various periods in a 37 °C water bath. Incubations were terminated by placing tubes on ice and diluting rapidly with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then pelleted for 5 s in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatant was replaced with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. After resuspension in sample buffer, cell extracts were prepared for electrophoresis by boiling for 6 min followed by clarification by centrifugation. Equal amounts of protein (∼20 μg in 10 μl) of each extract were then loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide minigels and separated using 30 mA/gel. Protein profiles were transferred to supported nitrocellulose membranes, which were then blocked by incubating in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.025% Tween 20 and 4% bovine serum albumin (PTS buffer) for 20 min at room temperature. In all cases the blots were probed by incubating without agitation with 1/1000 primary antibody in PTS at 4 °C overnight. MAP kinases on the blots were then visualized by rotating for 1 h at room temperature in PTS containing 1/2000 peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (PharMingen, La Jolla, CA) followed by chemiluminesence using enhanced reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Between incubation steps blots were washed in excess PTS buffer three times for 5 min each. To standardize for protein loading in each lane, blots were stripped by incubation in a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C. Blots were then washed extensively in PTS, followed by reprobing with antibody directed against the unphosphorylated form of p38. It has been shown previously that LPS and theN-formyl peptide fMLF stimulate the phosphorylation and activation of p38 in human neutrophils (17Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar, 18Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Furuya W. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Rane M.J. Carrithers S.L. Arthur J.M. Klein J.B. McLeish K.R. J.

Invest. 1997; 99: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). MEK3 and MEK6 are upstream kinases that, on activation by phosphorylation, can recognize p38 as a substrate both in vitro and in vivo. The presence or activation of either of these kinases has not previously been demonstrated in neutrophils. As shown here, challenge with 100 nm fMLF caused a rapid and transient phosphorylation of MEK3,6 in neutrophils, with a maximum within 1 min of stimulation and a return to basal levels within 15 min (Fig.1 A). This phosphorylation leads to activation of MEK3,6, as indicated by the equally rapid and transient appearance of phosphorylated p38. Stimulation of neutrophils with LPS (10 μg/ml) also resulted in phosphorylation of MEK3,6, with a concomitant appearance of phospho-p38 (Fig. 1 B). In agreement with previous findings (17Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar), the LPS-mediated phosphorylation of p38 and MEK3,6 was slower than that of fMLF, increasing after 5 min, and was maximal between 15 and 30 min after stimulation. Because the kinetics of MEK3,6 phosphorylation paralleled the appearance of phospho-p38 for both of these stimuli, it is likely that MEK3,6 is upstream of p38 in neutrophils as in other systems. In this study we did not address whether MEK3 or MEK6 (or both) was important in neutrophils, because our antibodies did not distinguish these closely related species. The signal detected on Western blots probed with phospho-MEK3,6 antibodies was very weak when compared with similar blots probed with phospho-MEK1,2 antibodies (see below), which suggests that these proteins are less abundant. This point supports previous findings, which have determined that MEK1 and MEK2 are the major isoforms found in neutrophils (35Grinstein S. Butler J.R. Furuya W. L'Allemain G. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19313-19320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Avdi N.J. Winston B.W. Russel M. Young S.K. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21005-21011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both LPS and fMLF are able to induce NO formation in neutrophils, and this function contributes to the biological activity of these agents. Furthermore, in Jurkat cells NO can activate several MAP kinase pathways (21Lander H.M. Jacovina A.T. Davis R.J. Tauras J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19705-19709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To examine the relevance of NO formation in the phosphorylation of p38, neutrophils were treated with either the NO scavenger 2-phenyl-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide or the NO-synthase inhibitor N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester before stimulation with fMLF and LPS. The increase in phospho-p38 levels measured 20 min after stimulation with LPS was dose-dependently inhibited by both 2-phenyl-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide andN-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (Fig.2, A and B). In contrast, neither of these drugs was capable of reducing fMLF-induced phosphorylation of p38 even at doses 100-fold over the published EC50 (Fig. 2, C and D). These data support a physiological role for NO formation in the activation of p38 in neutrophils by LPS but not by fMLF. Because NO production appeared to have a role in the activation of p38 MAP kinase, it was of interest to determine whether NO was sufficient to stimulate this pathway. Although several NO-releasing compounds are commercially available, some of these are problematic in neutrophils (38Kankaanranta H. Knowles R.G. Vuorinen P. Kosonen O. Holm P. Moilanen E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 882-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We chose to use agents that have been shown previously to be effective in neutrophils, includingS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, and a combination of sodium nitroprusside (an NO releasing agent) andN-acetyl-l-cysteine (increases availability of NO) (26Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb J.P. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M. Danner R.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4102-4109PubMed Google Scholar, 27Corriveau C.C. Madara P.J. Van Dervort A.L. Tropea M.M. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used here, incubation of neutrophils in medium without NO-releasing agents for periods of up to 30 min did not result in significant levels of phospho-p38 (Fig.3 A). However, in the presence of the NO-releasing agentsS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine and sodium nitroprusside/N-acetyl-l-cysteine, there was a notable increase in the phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 3, Band C). In both cases the increase in phospho-p38 was detectable within 20 min and increased in amount throughout the period investigated. The biological effects of NO formation are generally assumed to be attributable to the activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, leading to cGMP accumulation (39Hobbs A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 484-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 40Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 41Vaandrager A.B. de Jonge H.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 157: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). If this mechanism underlies the NO-mediated activation of p38, as measured here, then it follows that cGMP should also play an important role. To examine this question we used several different methods to increase the intracellular concentration of this messenger. Initial studies used phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, which presumably lead to an increase in basal cGMP levels by preventing cyclic nucleotide degradation. Treatment of neutrophils with the broad-range PDE inhibitor IBMX resulted in an increase in phospho-MEK3,6 and phospho-p38 after 1 min of incubation in the drug with maximal levels at 15 min (Fig.4 A). Although IBMX has been reported to have agonist activity to adenosine receptors, the phosphorylation of p38 by this drug was not affected by other adenosine agonists (data not shown). There are several PDEs known to be expressed in different mammalian tissues. In neutrophils the expression of both the cAMP-specific (PDE-IV) and the cGMP-specific (PDE-V) isoforms have been demonstrated (42Schudt C. Winder S. Forderkunz S. Hatzelmann A. Ullrich V. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1991; 344: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 43Grady P.G. Thomas L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 885: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 44Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Merricks E.P. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Treatment of neutrophils with RO-20-1724, a specific inhibitor of the cAMP-specific PDE-IV, was unable to increase the level of phosphorylated MEK3,6 in similar experiments (Fig.4 B). In contrast, it was found that the specific inhibitor of PDE-V (4-(methylenedioxy)-benzylamino-6-methoxyquinazoline) was equal to IBMX in its ability to increase levels of the phosphorylated forms of both MEK3,6 and p38 in neutrophils, which indicated an important role for cGMP in this phenomenon (Fig. 4 C). To lend support to the idea that cGMP but not cAMP is important to the activation of p38 in neutrophils, neutrophils were treated with activators of soluble guanylyl cyclase or of adenylyl cyclase. Activation of guanylyl cyclase by adding YC-1 to neutrophils resulted in a rapid phosphorylation of both p38 and MEK3,6, and this increased level remained stable within the 15-min period investigated (Fig.5 A). In contrast, increasing the intracellular cAMP concentration by treatment with forskolin did not change the levels of the phosphorylated forms of either p38 or MEK3,6 (Fig. 5 B). These studies demonstrate that an elevation in the intracellular concentration specifically of cGMP is sufficient to cause phosphorylation of p38 in neutrophils. Increasing the intracellular concentration of cGMP by treating cells with increasing doses of the membrane-permeable analog dibutyryl cGMP resulted in phosphorylation of both MEK3,6 and p38 (Fig.6 A). In these studies cGMP was effective at concentrations as low as 250 nm, and at 250 mm the resulting phosphorylation of p38 and MEK3,6 was equal to or greater (respectively) than levels produced by fMLF stimulation of the cells. The similarity in the phosphorylation of MEK3,6 and p38, both in terms of the effect of PDE inhibition and the dose response for dibutyryl cGMP, further supports the role of MEK3,6 in the regulation of p38 activity in neutrophils. In addition, these data point to cGMP-sensitive regulation of components upstream of MEK3,6 in neutrophils. Treatment of freshly isolated neutrophils with 250 mm dibutyryl cGMP caused a rapid and transient phosphorylation of MEK3 and p38, with maximal levels detected within 1 min after addition of this reagent to the cells. Using antibodies specific to the phosphorylated domain of other MEK isoforms, we found that the effect of cGMP was specific to MEK3,6, because neither MEK1,2 (Fig. 6) nor MEK4 (not shown) was affected by dibutyryl cGMP. The translation of elevated intracellular cGMP levels into a physiological response is often mediated by activation of protein kinase G (41Vaandrager A.B. de Jonge H.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 157: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of PKG is important to the phosphorylation of p38, neutrophils were treated with a specific inhibitor of this kinase before stimulation with LPS and fMLF (Fig.7). It was found that this inhibitor (KT5823) could dose-dependently block the accumulation of phospho-p38 when stimulated with LPS for 20 min. Furthermore, maximal doses reduced the phospho-p38 in response to LPS close to basal levels. The increases in phospho-p38 levels in neutrophils stimulated with fMLF for 1 min were only slightly reduced by blocking PKG activation even at maximal doses of this inhibitor (Fig. 7 B). This finding supports the observation that NO formation and elevation of cGMP levels do not contribute significantly to the activation of p38 by fMLF. Although the previous data favor a role for cGMP rather than cAMP in the activation of p38 downstream of LPS, higher concentrations of this nucleotide might stimulate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in addition to PKG. To test this hypothesis, the inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (H89) was compared with the PKG inhibitor KT5823 with respect to its ability to block LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 7 C). In these experiments inhibition of PKG using KT5823 at 100 times the reported EC50 completely blocked the increase in p38 phosphorylation by LPS. In contrast, blockade of cAMP-dependent protein kinase function with similar concentrations of H89 were ineffective. Stimulation of neutrophils with LPS or fMLF leads to activation of several MAP kinase pathways, although only MEK1,2 has been identified in these cells. In this study it was demonstrated that both LPS and fMLF were able to transiently activate MEK3,6 kinase activity in neutrophils. Both fMLF and LPS cause endogenous nitric oxide formation in neutrophils. Recent work by Lander and colleagues (21Lander H.M. Jacovina A.T. Davis R.J. Tauras J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19705-19709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) has demonstrated activation of ERK, c-jun-NH2-kinase, and p38 kinase activities after stimulation of Jurkat T-cells with NO. As shown here in human neutrophils, inhibition of the NO pathway was able to inhibit phosphorylation of p38 downstream of LPS but not fMLF. This result indicates that NO functions specifically downstream of LPS in p38 MAP kinase activation, and that fMLF must use different signaling pathways to achieve the same end. The different kinetics of p38 phosphorylation with fMLF reaching a maximum at 1–2 min, whereas LPS activated p38 only after 10–20 min, might reflect these underlying differences in signaling mechanism. Other work by Lander et al. (45Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 46Lander H.M.

It is not clear from their studies how NO might stimulate p38 MAP kinase activity in their system, or which stimuli might use this pathway to activate MAP kinases. Because activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase by NO is well documented, in this report we examined the role of cGMP in the signaling pathway leading to activation of p38 in neutrophils. It was found that phosphorylation of MEK3,6 was induced by increasing intracellular cGMP levels in several different ways: by inhibition of PDEs, by ligand-independent activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, or by addition of dibutyryl cGMP. The increase in phospho-MEK3,6 levels initiated by each of these treatments corresponded with activation of MEK3,6 kinase activity, as measured by the in vivophosphorylation of its physiological substrate p38. Because both LPS and fMLF stimulation of neutrophils leads to the phosphorylation of p38, it would follow that signals generated by each ligand must converge at some point upstream of p38. Results shown here suggest that this point of convergence is likely to be at, or upstream of, MEK3,6 activation. In contrast to the previous studies using Jurkat cells, results shown here demonstrate that the MEK3,6/p38 pathway is specifically phosphorylated downstream of the NO system and that activation of the MEK1,2/ERK pathway or the MEK4/c-jun-NH2-kinase pathway was not affected. This result suggests that NO-related species might signal to the MAP kinases using more than one mechanism and indicates cell type-specific differences in the responsive signaling pathways. To extend these findings, we show that the cGMP-dependent phosphorylation of p38 in neutrophils requires activation of PKG. The lack of effect of cAMP-elevating agents and of the inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase suggests that this pathway does not play an important role in the activation of p38 by LPS in this system. It is not known from our studies where in the p38 signaling pathway PKG is likely to function, because many proteins have been reported to have a role upstream of MEK3,6. Because the number of substrates for PKG that have been characterized in any system is few, and those that might contribute to activation of MAP kinase pathways have not been explored, this remains a question for future endeavors. LPS and fMLF use fundamentally different signaling mechanisms; the former is incompletely understood, whereas that latter uses activation of G-proteins. The differential effect of NO inhibitors on fMLF- and LPS-stimulated p38 phosphorylation reveals that there are different biochemical pathways capable of activating p38 phosphorylation in neutrophils. It remains to be determined whether other stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor α or interleukin 1β, which activate p38 with similar kinetics to LPS as measured here, also use NO generation as a mediator of MAP kinase activation. The mechanism used by fMLF to activate p38 in neutrophils requires both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and calcium-dependent activation of protein kinase C (18Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 5070-5078PubMed Google Scholar). Other work has shown that fMLF causes PKG to co-localize with intermediate filaments and to phosphorylate vimentin in a calcium-dependent manner, and speculation has suggested that in this context, PKG is involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement associated with the degranulation process (28Wyatt T.A.

However, results shown here would suggest that PKG does not contribute to the phosphorylation of p38 in response to stimulation with fMLF. Previous work has shown that NO can contribute to cytokine gene expression in neutrophils (26Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb J.P. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M. Danner R.L. J.

Activation of p38 has also been associated with transcription factor activation (1Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J. Scott P.H. Gould G.W. Plevin R. Cell.

Recent work has demonstrated that in LPS-stimulated neutrophils and monocytes, p38 is involved in cytokine production (9Foey A.D. Parry S.L. Williams L.M. Feldmann M. Foxwell B.M. Brennan F.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 920-928PubMed Google Scholar, 55Knall C. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3052-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that the activation of p38 MAP kinase by NO contributes to the inflammatory response in these cells through regulation of cytokine gene expression. It has been shown that p38 activation is important to the up-regulation of iNOS in glial cells and astrocytes (52Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Da Silva J. Pierrat B. Mary J.-L. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28373-28380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although this has not been demonstrated for myeloid cells, it is an intriguing possibility that longer-term activation of p38 might create an autonomous regulatory loop where the increased NO would help maintain or augment cytokine synthesis in these cells. In summary, we have investigated the role of NO production on the activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway in human neutrophils. It was found that exogenous NO caused phosphorylation of p38 in these cells. In addition, using inhibitors of NO synthesis it was shown that LPS but not fMLF used this pathway to activate p38. Preliminary investigations of the mechanism of action for NO indicated that cGMP accumulation was sufficient to cause phosphorylation of p38 and its upstream regulatory kinase MEK3,6 but not MEK1,2 and MEK4, which are associated with ERK and c-jun-NH2-kinase MAP kinase pathways, respectively. Inhibition of protein kinase G attenuated LPS- but not fMLF-induced phosphorylation of p38, suggesting that it might function downstream of NO formation but upstream of MEK3,6 in this pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2084138834,"We have found that the novel phospholipid diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP), identified in bacteria, yeast, and plants, but not in mammalian cells, is able to potently activate macrophages for enhanced secretion of arachidonate metabolites, a key event in the immunoinflammatory response of leukocytes. Macrophage responses to DGPP are specific and are not mediated by its conversion into other putative lipid mediators such as phosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidic acid, or diacylglycerol. The responses to DGPP are compatible with a receptor-recognition event because they are blocked by suramin. Intracellular signaling initiated by DGPP includes phosphorylation and activation of the Group IV cytosolic phospholipase A2 and of the extracellular-signal regulated p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p44 MAPK, and membrane translocation of the protein kinase C isoenzymes alpha, epsilon, delta. These results establish DGPP as a novel macrophage-activating factor and suggest a potential role for this compound in triggering homeostatic cellular responses."

Our studies have been directed at elucidating the mechanisms by which T3 and cAMP stimulate the expression of the gene for PEPCK in the liver. Regulation of gene transcription by T3 is mediated through the binding of liganded T3 receptors (TR) to T3 response elements (TRE) in the promoters of genes (2Lazar M.A. Endocr.

The results indicate that the α or β isoforms of C/EBP have similar functions when bound to this element. Gel mobility assays were conducted on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (80:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 22 mm Tris and 190 mm glycine at 4 °C (8Park E.A. Song S. Olive M. Roesler W.J. Biochem.

The binding reactions were performed at room temperature in 10% glycerol, 80 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Each binding reaction contained 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor and proteins as indicated. Nuclear proteins were prepared from HepG2 cells by the method of Shapiro et al.

The sequence was confirmed by sequence analysis at the St. Jude Center for Biotechnology. Gal4-C/EBPβ 1–108 and 1–66 were constructed by PCR amplification. The forward primer, which contained an EcoRI site and the first 18 nucleotides of the rat C/EBPβ cDNA, tccgaattcatgcaccgcctgctggcctgggac, was used in PCR amplification.

Following PCR amplification with the forward and reverse primers and the rat C/EBPβ cDNA as template (14Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L.

This DNA fragment was ligated into the mammalian Gal4 DNA expression vector called pM (CLONTECH). To create the Gal4-C/EBPβ 1–25, the Gal4-C/EBPβ 1–108 vector was digested with BalI and HindIII. The restriction site overhangs were filled in with Klenow enzyme and the four deoxynucloetide triphosphates, and then the plasmid was religated. The Gal4-C/EBPβ 1–264 was created by digestion of 1–108 withBalI and PstI. The BalI toPstI fragment of C/EBPβ cDNA containing amino acids 25–264 was ligated into this site. The Gal4-C/EBPβ 1–138 were generated by digestion of 1–264 with HindIII andSfuI. These restriction site overhangs were filled in with Klenow enzyme and religated. Construction of the Gal4-C/EBPα vectors is given elsewhere (11Roesler W.J. Crosson S.M. Vinson C. McFie P.J. J. Biol.

HepG2 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (8Park E.A. Song S. Olive M. Roesler W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Each transfection contained 5.0 μg of PEPCK-CAT vector, 5.0 μg of the expression vector RSV-TRβ, and 2.0 μg of SV40-β-gal as a transfection control. Total DNA concentration was kept constant by the addition of pBluescript (Stratagene). CAT assays were conducted with [3H]chloramphenicol andn-butyryl-coenzyme A using the xylene phase extraction method (8Park E.A. Song S. Olive M. Roesler W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All transfections were performed in duplicate and repeated three to six times. For the transfections with the luciferase vectors, the calcium phosphate precipitate included 3.0 μg of PEPCK-luciferase, 1.0 μg of an expression vector for the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, and 1.0 μg of SV40-β-gal. Luciferase assays were conducted with the luciferin reagent as outlined by the manufacturer (Promega). The goal of these studies was to evaluate the role of C/EBPβ proteins bound to the P3(I) site in modulating PEPCK gene expression. To demonstrate that C/EBP proteins are involved in the T3induction of PEPCK transcription, we tested a set of specific dominant negative vectors. A-C/EBP is a dominant negative C/EBP vector, which has the C/EBP leucine zipper attached to an acidic amphipathic helix containing 4 heptad repeats (22Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The amphipathic helix interacts with the basic region of C/EBP proteins. A-C/EBP forms a strong non-DNA binding heterodimer and will inhibit all C/EBP proteins (22Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A-CREB is a dominant negative CREB protein with a CREB leucine zipper and an amphipathic helix (23Ahn S. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). A-Fos is a dominant negative Jun vector with the Fos leucine zipper and an amphipathic helix (24Olive M. Krylov D. Echlin D.R. Gardener K. Taparowsky E. Vinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18586-18594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of these dominant negative proteins on the T3responsiveness of the PEPCK gene, a PEPCK-CAT vector containing 490 base pairs of the PEPCK promoter driving the CAT reporter gene (−490-PCAT) was cotransfected with three dominant negative vectors (Table I). The addition of T3stimulated the −490-PCAT vector 3.5-fold. Cotransfection with A-C/EBP inhibited the 3–4-fold induction of −490-PCAT by T3. The dominant negative CREB did not affect the induction by T3, and cotransfection with the dominant negative Jun actually improved the T3 response from 3.5-fold to 9-fold. Although the reason for the enhanced responsiveness is not clear, it has been shown that C/EBP and Fos/Jun can bind to the P3(II) and P4(I) sites in the PEPCK promoter (15Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher J.D. Shuman J. Friedman A. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6264-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the Fos/Jun binding may allow increased binding of C/EBP proteins. When the PTRE was converted to an optimal TRE containing a direct repeat of the AGGTCA motif separated by four nucleotides (DR4) in the context of the PEPCK promoter, the dominant negative C/EBP vector still inhibited the T3 induction (data not shown). Therefore, the inhibition of the T3stimulation by A-C/EBP is dependent not on the specific sequence of the PTRE but on its context within the PEPCK promoter.Table IDominant negative C/EBP proteins inhibit the thyroid hormone induction of PEPCK gene transcriptionReporter vectorDominant negative vectorInduction by T3-fold−490-PCATNone3.5 ± 0.3−490-PCATA-C/EBP1.0 ± 0.1−490-PCATA-CREB4.2 ± 0.4−490-PCATA-Fos9.3 ± 0.9DR4X2 SV40-LucNone11.1 ± 0.4DR4X2 SV40-LucA-C/EBP23.0 ± 5.0DR4X2 SV40-LucA-CREB8.2 ± 0.7DR4X2 SV40-LucA-Fos13.0 ± 1.5HepG2 cells were transfected with 5 μg of PEPCK-CAT vector (−490-PCAT), 5 μg of RSV-TRβ, 5 μg of dominant negative expression vector for either C/EBP (A-C/EBP), CREB (A-CREB), or Jun (A-Fos), and 2.0 μg of SV40-β-gal. For the transfections with luciferase vectors, HepG2 cells were transfected with 3 μg of SV40-luciferase (DR4X2 SV40-Luc), 3 μg of RSV-TRβ, 3 μg of dominant negative vector, and 1 μg of SV40-β-gal. Following transfection, the cells were placed in DMEM containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum.

Thyroid hormone (T3) was added at a concentration of 100 nm for 48 h prior to harvesting for CAT assays. All transfections were repeated three to five times in duplicate. The results are presented as the -fold induction by T3 ± S.E. As a control, two copies of a consensus TRE containing a DR4 motif were ligated in front of the enhancerless SV40 promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene and transfected into HepG2 cells with the three dominant negative proteins. Transcription of the SV40-luciferase vector was stimulated 11-fold by T3 (Table I). None of the dominant negative vectors decreased the T3 response. In fact, the T3 induction of the SV40-luciferase vector was increased in the presence of A-C/EBP. These observations indicate that the role of C/EBP in T3 responsiveness is specific to the PEPCK gene and that the inhibition of PEPCK-CAT by A-C/EBP is not an inhibition of the TR. We have used both the CAT and luciferase reporter genes in these studies. Our results are similar with either reporter gene. Generally, we have used the CAT gene for our studies with T3 and PEPCK promoter so that we can easily compare our results with our previous work. Our recent experiments with cAMP and the PEPCK promoter have been conducted with the luciferase gene. Previous studies had shown that C/EBP, CREB, and AP-1 proteins were involved in the stimulation of PEPCK transcription by cAMP (9Roesler W.J. Graham J.G. Kolen R. Klemm D.J. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8225-8232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine whether dominant negative vectors for C/EBP, CREB, or Jun would affect the cAMP response, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with a mammalian expression vector for the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), −490 PEPCK-luciferase (−490-PLuc), and the dominant negative vectors. Overexpression of PKA increased the luciferase activity 6-fold, and this stimulation was reduced by each dominant negative protein (Table II). These results confirm that the cAMP induction requires all three proteins and support the mutational studies of the PEPCK gene in which disruption of CRE, P3(I), P3(II), or P4(I) decreased the induction by cAMP (9Roesler W.J.

All transfections were performed three to five times in duplicate. The inductions by PKA are presented as -fold induction ± S.E.

To test whether the DNA binding domain of the TRβ was required for the T3 induction of PEPCK transcription, the PTRE was converted into a Gal4 binding site to create −330 PTRE/G4-PCAT (see Fig. 1 A). This CAT vector was cotransfected with a Gal4-TRβ mammalian expression vector, which has the ligand binding/transactivation domain of the TRβ (amino acids 168–456) fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (25Baniahmad A.

The Gal4-TRβ will bind to the Gal4 site in the PEPCK-CAT vector. An 80-fold stimulation of PEPCK-CAT activity was obtained (TableIII). Even with the robust T3induction obtained with the Gal4-TRβ vector, mutation of the P3(I) site (−330 PTRE/G4-P3 m PCAT) eliminated the T3 response. Cotransfection of −330 PTRE/G4-PCAT with A-C/EBP also severely decreased the T3 induction (data not shown).Table IIIT3 responsiveness of the PEPCK promoter can be mediated by TR homodimers or heterodimersReporter vectorReceptor expression vectorInduction by T3-fold−330 TRE/G4-PCATNone1.2 ± 0.1−330 TRE/G4-PCATGal4-TRβ80.7 ± 20.7−330 TRE/G4-P3M-PCATGal4-TRβ2.1 ± 0.2−330 TRE/G4-PCATΔΔTR1.5 ± 0.1−330 TRE/G4-PCATGal4-RXRα1.3 ± 0.3−330 TRE/G4-PCATGal4-RXRα/ΔΔTR56.0 ± 16.9−330 TRE/G4-PCATRSV-TRβ0.8 ± 0.1−330 TRE/G4-PCATGal4-RXRα/RSV-TRβ3.9 ± 0.3−330 TRE/G4-P3M-PCATGal4-RXRα/ΔΔTR2.5 ± 0.3HepG2 cells were transfected with 5 μg of the PEPCK-CAT vector and either 0.5 μg of Gal4-TRβ, 0.5 μg of ΔΔTRβ, 0.5 μg of Gal-RXRα, or 5 μg of RSV-TRβ. All transfections contained 2 μg of SV40-β-gal. Following transfection, the cells were placed in medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum with 100 nm T3. Cells were harvested after 48 h and assayed for CAT activity. All transfections were done in duplicate and repeated at least three times. The data are presented as -fold induction ± S.E. Open table in a new tab HepG2 cells were transfected with 5 μg of the PEPCK-CAT vector and either 0.5 μg of Gal4-TRβ, 0.5 μg of ΔΔTRβ, 0.5 μg of Gal-RXRα, or 5 μg of RSV-TRβ.

Cells were harvested after 48 h and assayed for CAT activity. All transfections were done in duplicate and repeated at least three times. The data are presented as -fold induction ± S.E. To determine if the T3 effect could be mediated by TR-RXR heterodimers, we used a Gal4-RXRα mammalian expression vector (Gal4-RXRα) and a mammalian expression vector for the ligand binding domain of TRβ (CMV-ΔΔTRβ) (26Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). ΔΔTRβ cannot bind DNA. When cotransfected with Gal4-RXRα, ΔΔTRβ associates with the promoter through heterodimerization with Gal4-RXRα. Co-transfection of −330 PTRE/G4 PCAT with the combination of Gal4-RXRα and ΔΔTRβ stimulated transcription 56-fold in the presence of T3 (Table III). ΔΔTRβ alone did not mediate a T3 response, and mutation of the P3(I) site eliminated the T3 induction. These observations indicate that the TRβ ligand binding domain is sufficient for the interaction with C/EBP proteins if it is tethered to the PEPCK promoter. In addition, these results suggest that the T3 effect could be mediated by either TR homodimers or TR-RXR heterodimers. The next experiments examined whether sequences adjacent to the C/EBP binding site were required for T3 and cAMP responsiveness. A series of mutations was introduced through the P3(I) binding region in the context of the −490-PLuc and −490-PCAT vectors. The C/EBP binding site (TTGTGTAAG) is contained within nucleotides −243 to −235. The mutations that were introduced into the −490-PCAT vector of nucleotides −248 to −245, −243 to −238, and −237 to −235 are shown in Fig. 1 B. Alteration of nucleotides −243/−238 and −237/−235 eliminated C/EBP binding, whereas mutation of nucleotides −248/−245 did not affect C/EBP binding (data not shown). Mutation of nucleotides −243/−238 and −237/−235 diminished PKA responsiveness and basal expression (TableIV). The mutation of nucleotides −248/45 caused a slight reduction in the PKA responsiveness and a small increase in basal transcription. Alteration of the base pairs −243/−238 and −237/−235 eliminated the T3 response. Mutation of nucleotides −248 to −245 reduced the T3stimulation modestly. In conjunction with the data from the dominant negative vectors, these results indicate that the protein bound to the P3(I) site that contributes to basal expression and hormone responsiveness is a member of the C/EBP family.Table IVEffect of various mutations within P3(I) region on responsiveness to T3, overexpression of PK"

Hsp15 is well conserved and related to a number of RNA-binding proteins, including ribosomal protein S4, RNA pseudouridine synthase, and tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. The region shared between these proteins appears to represent a common, but previously unrecognized, RNA binding motif. Filter binding studies showed that Hsp15 binds to a 17-mer single-stranded RNA with a dissociation constant of 9 μm in 22.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2. A role of Hsp15 in binding nucleic acids puts this protein into a different functional category from that of many other heat shock proteins that act as molecular chaperones or proteases on protein substrates.

Temperature upshifts and a number of other stress conditions result in the rapid production of a number of proteins termed heat shock proteins (Hsps).1Although heat shock proteins were initially studied from a regulatory viewpoint, in recent years more and more attention has focused on determining the function of these proteins. All four major classes of heat shock proteins (Hsp90, Hsp70, GroE, and small heat shock proteins) are known to function as molecular chaperones, proteins that help other proteins adopt a biologically active conformation, without themselves becoming part of the final structure (1Schwarz E. Lilie H. Rudolph R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of heat shock proteins are proteases, which hydrolyze irreversibly damaged proteins (2Gross C.A. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, DC1996: 1382-1399Google Scholar). Thus, heat shock proteins appear to be generally involved in the folding and degradation of proteins. Sensitive RNA hybridization techniques and the availability of an ordered, sequenced library of Escherichia coli clones have made possible the discovery of 26 new heat shock proteins in E. coli (3Chuang S.-E. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5242-5252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). This represents a largely untapped resource of novel heat shock proteins. In this paper, we report that one of these proteins, Hsp15, is an abundant, well conserved nucleic acid-binding protein, a function distinct from that of other previously described heat shock proteins. The BamHI fragment encoding the Hsp15 gene, yrfH (hslR), was isolated from λ clone 621 (4Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) and ligated into pUC19 (New England Biolabs) giving the plasmid pTHZ13. The hslR gene was isolated via PCR using pTHZ13 as the template, primer Hsp15-P1 (5′-TGAAGGAGACCATATGAAAGAGAAA-3′), primer Hsp15-P2 (5′-TCTTGCAGGATCCAGTTATTCACT-3′), and Taq polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR product was purified with the QIAEX kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), digested with BamHI and NdeI, and ligated into the overexpression vector pET11a (Ref. 5Dubendorff J.W. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar; Novagen) to generate the plasmid pTHZ25. The sequence of this construct was confirmed by sequencing the entire insert region on both strands using an ABI automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). The strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) harboring the plasmid pTHZ25 was induced at anA 578 of 0.8–1.0 with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h and harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 5000 × g, 4 °C). All further steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in cold buffer A (30 mm sodium borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5) and lysis was performed by two passes through a French pressure cell (1 inch in diameter, American Instrument) at 18,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged (25 min, 39,100 × g) and the supernatant immediately loaded onto a tandem ion-exchange chromatography system consisting of 50 ml of Q-Sepharose and subsequent 25 ml of SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) both equilibrated with buffer A. After washing to base line at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and removing the Q-Sepharose column, the SP-Sepharose column was eluted with 10 column volumes (250 ml) of a linear KCl-gradient (0.0–1.0 m KCl in buffer A). Hsp15-containing fractions as assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were pooled and dialyzed over night against a >500-fold volume of buffer B (30 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0). During this dialysis a precipitate formed that was removed by centrifugation (15 min, 34,800 ×g, 4 °C). The supernatant was brought to 1.5m ammonium sulfate in buffer B and loaded onto a 25-ml Phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing to base line, the protein was eluted with 250 ml of a linear gradient with decreasing ammonium sulfate concentration (1.5–0.0 m ammonium sulfate in buffer B). Fractions that contained Hsp15 only were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (180-ml Amicon cell; 3-kDa exclusion volume membrane (Millipore)). To test for coelution of Hsp15 with nucleic acids, the Q-Sepharose column was eluted separately with a linear KCl gradient (500 ml, 0.0–1.0 m KCl in buffer A). Aliquots of the fractions were concentrated by ethanol precipitation (6Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and assayed for nucleic acid content with agarose gels (6Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Using the method of Edelhoch (7Edelhoch H.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar) the molar extinction coefficient was determined as 15,524 m−1cm−1, which is in good agreement with the calculated value of 15,470 m−1 cm−1 (8Pace N.C. Vajados F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar), and was used for determination of Hsp15 concentrations. hslR PCR product (0.1 pmol) was fixed to a Hybond (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) nylon membrane and probed with labeled coding DNA as prepared by reverse transcription of 20 μg of total RNA (isolated with Trizol reagent; Life Technologies, Inc.) from log phase cultures grown at 37 °C or from the same culture heat-shocked for 10 min at 46 °C. Cultures of E. coli AB1157 or MC4100 were grown in LB (6Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 29 °C until anA 546 = 1.0 (50 ml of culture in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks, 300 rpm air shaker, doubling time 40–50 min). Subsequent heat shock was achieved by transferring to a 42 °C shaking water bath, the new temperature in the culture being reached after <3 min. For the heat shock kinetic, aliquots were withdrawn, cooled in ice-water, and centrifuged (1 min, 7900 × g, 4 °C), and the cells were washed in cold 150 mm NaCl and re-centrifuged. The cell pellet was lysed in 2.4% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8.0% glycerol by heating to 95 °C for 10–30 min. The protein content of the lysate was determined by a modified Lowry assay using BSA as a standard (9Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7067) Google Scholar). The amount of Hsp15 present was determined by Western immunoblotting analysis according to the protocol of the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The films were scanned with an Elscript 400 AT densitometer (Hirschmann, Neuried, Germany) and analyzed using the PEAKFIT program (Jandel Scientific). Known quantities of purified Hsp15 were treated on the same blots for calibration. Both strains gave consistent results. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against purified Hsp15 was a gift of Michael Ehrmann (Universität Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany). The sedimentation analysis data were collected with a Beckman model E analytical ultracentrifuge in an AN-D rotor and double sector cells; one sector contained Hsp15 at 11.6 μm in buffer B, and the reference sector contained only buffer B. The molecular weight was determined by the meniscus depletion method (10Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar), and the evaluation of the corresponding high speed (20,000 rpm) sedimentation equilibrium data (ln c versus r 2W. B. M. Muse, T. Zander, and J. C. A. Bardwell, unpublished data.) was done by a computer program developed by Dr. G. Boehm, Regensburg, Germany. The specific volume of the protein was assumed to be 0.735 ml/g (11Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Rheinhold Publishing, New York1943: 374-377Google Scholar). The temperature at equilibrium was 19 °C. Analytical gel filtration was done on a Superdex 75 analytical grade HR10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The additional salt in the running buffer was necessary to prevent Hsp15 from sticking to the column material. 5–14 μg of Hsp15 were loaded at a concentration of 150 μm in buffer B. Single-stranded, circular M13mp18 DNA (7249 bases; U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was heated to 80 °C for 2 min prior to use. The plasmid pGEM-3Z (2743 base pairs; Invitrogen) was prepared with the kit Nucleobond AX 500 (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The commercially available RNA preparation (yeast RNA type III; Sigma, catalog no. R7125) is reported to consist mainly of tRNA (12Holley R.W. Apgar J. Doctor B.P. Farrow J. Marini M.A. Merrill S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 200-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein, nucleic acid, buffer, and salt were mixed in a final volume of 18 μl, and complex formation was allowed to proceed for at least 30 min at room temperature. To assure equilibrium, up to 1 week of incubation time was tested with no change in the apparent band patterns compared with the 30-min incubation time. Immediately prior to loading 2 μl of 10× loading buffer (50% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol) was added. Electrophoresis was performed in 1% agarose (Biozyme) gels using TAE buffer (6Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 120 V for 3–4 h. Afterwards, the gels were stained with ethidium bromide (6Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The quantitative zonal affinity chromatography was performed as described in Jenuwine and Shaner (13Jenuwine E.S. Shaner S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), except that instead of the high performance liquid chromatography we used a FPLC system with the HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The elution buffer was 1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.7, 0.1 mm EDTA, with NaCl added to the designated concentration (13Jenuwine E.S. Shaner S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations and volumes loaded on the column were as follows: RNase A (Sigma), 6.6 mg/ml in H2O, 10 μl loaded; Hsp15, 2.39 mg/ml in buffer B, 6 μl loaded; cro repressor (a gift from Katrin Ramm, Universität Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany), 1.6 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μl loaded; lac repressor (a gift from Sonya Melcher, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), 4.18 mg/ml in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.55, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol, 30% glycerol, 5 μl loaded. To calculate the affinities, the concentration of DNA in nucleotides was used. This was 1.26–2.73 mm accessible nucleotides depending on the DNA-cellulose preparation, determined as in Ref. 13Jenuwine E.S. Shaner S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar. The data were consistent, independent of the batch of DNA-cellulose. The data were plotted and analyzed with the SigmaPlot program (Sigma). A DEAE filter (NA45 DEAE-cellulose, Schleicher & Schuell) was soaked for 10 min in 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, then 10 min in 0.5 m NaOH with shaking at room temperature, washed to neutrality with water, and incubated for >1 h in the wash buffer (22.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.75 mm EDTA). The nitrocelluose-filter (Protran nitrocellulose, Schleicher & Schuell) was treated as the DEAE-cellulose but without the EDTA step. Immediately prior to application of the samples, the two filters were mounted in a 48-slot blotting device (Hoefer), the nitrocellulose filter directly on top of the DEAE filter. Only a very gentle vacuum was applied to prevent the filters from drying out. For the same reason, all samples were added as fast as possible, which usually did not take more than 5 min in total. The volume of the binding reaction was 10 μl; the buffer was the same as the wash buffer plus additional 1.0 μm BSA (New England Biolabs), 8 mm1,4-dithio-dl-threitol, and 3.2 units of RNAsin (Promega). Binding reactions were incubated at room temperature (23–25 °C) for about 20 min. Addition of BSA prior to the addition of Hsp15 was important to prevent Hsp15-RNA-complexes from sticking to tube walls. The Hsp15 preparation was RNase-free, but the RNase inhibitor RNAsin was always added when using BSA. When the liquid of the samples had completely passed the filters, the slot was immediately washed with 200 μl of wash buffer. The sequences of the various RNA substrates were: GMP as monomer, CUG as trimer, CUCG as tetramer, CCCUC(dT) as hexamer, GGGAACGUC as nonamer, and GGGAACGUCGUCGUCGC as heptadecamer (17-mer). All substrates were 5′-32P-labeled as described in Ref. 14Herschlag D. Khosla M. Tsuchihashi Z. Karpel R.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2913-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar. About 2000 cpm/slot were used. The dried filters were quantitated and analyzed with the PhosphorImager System (Molecular Dynamics). The curve fit in Fig. 7 was done with the program Kaleidagraph (Macintosh). The protease assay was done according to Twining (15Twinig S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 143: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar); the chaperone assay was performed as described by Jakobet al. (16Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Dialysis buffer was used as negative control. Positive controls were trypsin (Sigma) and Hsp90 (a gift from U. Jakob). Twenty-six new heat shock genes were discovered in E. coli by global transcription analysis and mapped to specific λ clones in the ordered Kohara library (3Chuang S.-E. Blattner F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5242-5252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the estimated molecular weights of the corresponding heat shock proteins and the recently released sequence of the complete E. coligenome, we have been able to assign most of these “heat shock loci” (hsl) genes to sequenced open reading frames.2 We consider these genes a largely unexplored resource of heat shock genes unrelated to previously studied heat shock genes. One of these,yrfH (hslR) encodes a 15,496-Da protein with a calculated isoelectric point (pI) of 9.94. Based on the molecular weight and the heat inducibility of the product of the yrfH (hslR) gene, we have assigned it the name Hsp15. The Hsp15 sequence was used to search the nonredundant data base and the data base of unfinished microbial genomes maintained at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Significant matches were found for sequences present in a wide variety of prokaryotic organisms including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Fig. 1). All of the homologues are very basic proteins, with pI values ranging from 9.9 to 10.3. We conclude that Hsp15 is a member of a previously undescribed family of well conserved, highly basic proteins. The molecular mass values of the Hsp15 homologues in Gram-negative organisms are in the range of 15.1–15.5 kDa. The proteins in the Gram-positive organismsStreptococcus and Bacillus are 5 kDa smaller in size due to a shortened C terminus. We decided to further investigate the function of this protein because its high degree of conservation implies that it plays an important role. We reasoned that, because it is not related to any known heat shock protein, this role may turn out to be new. The search of the nonredundant data base with E. coliHsp15 was iterated using the sensitive PSI-BLAST program, which includes profile construction (17Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). This search method automatically combines the significant alignments produced by BLAST into a matrix of position-specific scores. Searching the data base using this matrix in many cases allows the discovery of faint, but biologically relevant sequence similarities. Using this approach, a number of proteins that interact with RNA were found to contain a motif in common with each other and Hsp15 (Fig. 2). These include ribosomal protein S4, RNA pseudouridine synthase, and tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. A 31-amino acid motif that usually begins with the sequence RLD and ends with the sequence NG is shared among Hsp15, these families of RNA-binding proteins, and HlyA. HlyA is homologous to FtsJ, a RNA methylase, 3H. Buegl, U. Jakob, and J. C. A. Bardwell, unpublished data.suggesting that members of the HlyA family may bind RNA as well. A purification strategy based on the high isoelectric point of Hsp15 was devised. It involved a tandem ion-exchange chromatography system at pH 8.5 consisting of an anion exchange “pre-clearing” column, immediately followed by a subsequent cation exchange “trapping” column. Of the contaminating proteins co-eluting with Hsp15 from the cation exchange matrix, nearly all precipitated during the following dialysis, which therefore served as an effective purification step. A hydrophobic chromatography step separated Hsp15 from a small amount of degradation product. Hsp15 was assayed for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent silver staining and was estimated by densitometry (data not shown) to be of greater than 99.7% purity. The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of the first nine amino acids; the initiation methionine was still present. Although Hsp15 is expected to still be positively charged at pH 8.5, elution of the anion exchange column yielded some Hsp15-containing fractions. These fractions also showed the presence of nucleic acids in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels (data not shown). This co-elution suggested to us that Hsp15 bound to the anion exchange matrix via nucleic acids, suggesting a tight interaction between Hsp15 and nucleic acids. To verify that Hsp15 is indeed a member of a new heat shock protein family, mRNA hybridization experiments were performed (Fig.3, inset). A transient burst of heat shock RNA synthesis normally occurs in the 5–15 min following temperature shift. mRNA was prepared from log phase E. coli cultures grown at 37 °C or from the same culture after a 10-min heat shock treatment at 46 °C. As shown in theinset to Fig. 3 and characteristic of heat shock genes, Hsp15's mRNA is strongly up-regulated upon a temperature shift from 37 °C to 46 °C. This transient burst of heat shock mRNA synthesis has the effect of rapidly allowing the heat shock proteins to reach a new higher steady state level following temperature shift. In order to quantitate the level of Hsp15 protein present during steady state growth, we measured the intracellular abundance of Hsp15 in exponentially growing cultures at 29 °C and various times following a shift to 42 °C. Western immunoblot analysis showed that cultures at 29 °C contained 1.29‰ w/w Hsp15 per total cell protein. This fraction increased to 2.22‰, 2.37‰, and 2.04‰ after 11, 22.5, and 45 min of heat shock treatment (42 °C), respectively. Thus 12,000–22,000 molecules of Hsp15 are present per cell, as calculated using a conversion factor of 2.34 ×10−13 g of protein/cell (Ref. 19Bremer H. Dennis P.P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, DC1996: 1553-1569Google Scholar; Fig. 3). To calculate the intracellular concentration, the association state of Hsp15 needed to be determined. Hsp15 was found to be a monomer, in the absence of nucleic acid, by both analytical ultracentrifugation (14.7 ± 1.3 kDa) and gel permeation chromatography (15.8 ± 2.4 kDa) (Fig.4). According to an average volume of anE. coli cell of 0.63 μm3 (Ref. 20Donachie W.D. Robison A.C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, DC1987: 1578-1593Google Scholar; doubling time of 40 min), the intracellular concentration of Hsp15 is 30–60 μm. This makes Hsp15 a very abundant protein in the cell before and after heat shock, even more abundant than the GroEL 14-mer, which has been estimated (using slightly different conversion factors) to be present in 1580 copies or at a concentration of 2.6 μm at 37 °C (21Lorimer G.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The observed ∼2-fold increase in Hsp15 at the protein level is very similar to the degree of increase in protein level seen with the other characterized heat shock proteins inE. coli. The average increase in steady state level following shift from 30 °C and 42 °C for the 11 heat shock proteins that have been measured in E. coli is 1.97-fold (22VanBogelen R.A. Abshire K.Z. Pertsemlidis A. Clark R.L. Neidhardt F.C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, DC1996: 2067-2117Google Scholar). Many show similar n-fold increases such as GroEL (2.3-fold) or DnaK (2.0-fold); some, such as GrpE (1.3-fold) and lon (1.1-fold), show less of an increase; one other, HtpG, shows a substantially greater increase of 3.8-fold (22VanBogelen R.A. Abshire K.Z. Pertsemlidis A. Clark R.L. Neidhardt F.C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, DC1996: 2067-2117Google Scholar). To directly show that Hsp15 binds nucleic acids, we tested its ability to shift various kinds of nucleic acids in gel retardation assays. Three different substrates were tested: the plasmid pGEM-3Z as an example of dsDNA, the single-stranded vector M13mp18 as an example of ssDNA, and a commercially available RNA preparation that consists mainly of tRNA. Under the same conditions and within the same gels, Hsp15 was compared with two well characterized nucleic acid-binding proteins: RNase A, as an example for a very weak binder (23Jensen D.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7198-7214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the λ phage cro repressor, which exhibits high binding affinities (24Boschelli F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The binding reaction was performed in buffer B plus 150 mm KCl to mimic physiological ionic strength to a first approximation. The highest protein concentration was also tested in buffer B without additional KCl to give an impression of binding in low salt. Fig. 5 a shows the gel retardation assay using the dsDNA substrate (pGEM-3Z). The migration behavior of the naked DNA is seen in lanes 1 and17. As is typical for plasmid preparations, there are four major bands corresponding to the supercoiled and nicked form of the plasmid monomers and dimers (25Johnson P.H. Grossman L.I. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4217-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). RNase A shows hardly any effect at the RNase A concentrations tested, not even in low salt (Fig.5 a, lanes 2–6). This indicates that the assay in this range of protein concentrations is not sensitive enough to detect the low binding affinity of RNase A to dsDNA. In contrast, the cro repressor clearly shifts all four bands of the plasmid preparation (Fig. 5 a, lanes 12–16). The retardation becomes more pronounced with rising protein concentration arguing for an additive binding mode. A very similar behavior is seen for Hsp15 (Fig. 5 a,lanes 7–11). This is clear evidence that Hsp15 is binding to dsDNA. The extent of band shift for both Hsp15 and the crorepressor was increased at the low salt conditions (Fig. 5 a,lanes 11 and 16). This confirms that the binding interaction is sensitive to ionic strength. The same type of experiment was repeated using a single-stranded DNA substrate (Fig. 5 b). Here, RNase A shows a slight shift at high concentration reflecting its higher affinity for ssDNA than dsDNA (23Jensen D.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7198-7214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp15 retards ssDNA to a greater extent at lower concentration than the cro repressor, perhaps suggesting a preference of Hsp15 for single-stranded over double-stranded substrates (see Fig.5 b, lanes 10 and 11 versus 15 and 16). Fig. 5 c shows that both Hsp15 and the crorepressor clearly retard the migration of a mainly tRNA substrate. The abundance of the shifted complex appears to be higher with Hsp15. In order to assess the interaction of Hsp15 with dsDNA in a more quantitative way, we employed zonal quantitative affinity chromatography. This method provides a rapid and convenient means to quantitatively compare a protein of interest with standard proteins in its nucleic acid binding affinity as well as the salt dependence of this affinity (13Jenuwine E.S. Shaner S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Proteins with affinity for DNA will cyclically bind and unbind as they pass through a DNA cellulose column. The time it takes a protein to elute from such a column compared with the elution time under high salt conditions, where no binding occurs, is directly correlated to the affinity constant KB, if chromatography is performed in the linear regime allowing rapid determinations ofKB values (13Jenuwine E.S. Shaner S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The range of KB values for which the method is applicable is limited to the window of 102 to 104m−1. Higher affinities will generate prolonged elution times, diffusion of the protein peak, and subsequent detection problems. However, most nonspecific protein-DNA interaction equilibrium constants can be shifted into the 102 to 104m−1 window by adjusting the salt concentration since the cation concentration is the major determinant for the affinity of a nonspecific protein-DNA interaction (26Record Jr., M.T. Lohman T.M. deHaseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Using this method, Hsp15 was compared in its elution properties at varying salt concentrations to three proteins whose nonspecific binding affinities to DNA are well studied: the lac repressor, RNase A, and the cro repressor (Fig.6, a–c). The binding affinity of Hsp15 to the dsDNA matrix was found to be virtually the same as that of the lac repressor (Fig.6 a). Linear regressions for the data sets of Hsp15 and thelac repressor are in good agreement. Further, the measured values for the lac repressor meet very well previously published data for the nonspecific binding of the lacrepressor to dsDNA (Fig. 6 b; Refs. 27Lohman T.M. Wensley C.G. Cina J. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3561Google Scholar, 28deHaseth P.L. Gross C.A. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T.

A linear regression for the combined sets of data from the literature and our measurements for the lacrepressor (log(KB/m−1) = −2.92–9.61 log([NaCl]/m); r 2 = 0.941) resembles very much the salt dependence of the affinity constant for the lac repressor as published by Jenuwine and Shaner (Ref"
https://openalex.org/W2038402717,"Iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) are redox-sensitive RNA-binding proteins that modulate the expression of several genes encoding key proteins of iron metabolism. IRP1 can also exist as an aconitase containing a [4Fe-4S] cluster bound to three cysteines at the active site. We previously showed that biosynthesis of nitric oxide (NO) induces the transition of IRP1 from aconitase to apoprotein able to bind RNA. This switch is also observed when cytosolic extracts are exposed to NO donors. However, the activation of IRP1 under these conditions is far from maximal. In this study we examined the capacity of physiological reducing systems to cooperate with NO in the activation of IRP1. Cytosolic extracts from the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 or purified IRP1 were incubated with NO donors and subsequently exposed to glutathione or to thioredoxin (Trx), a strong protein disulfide reductase. Trx was the most effective, inducing a 2–6-fold enhancement of the RNA binding activity of NO-treated IRP1. Furthermore, the effect of NO on IRP1 from cytosolic extracts was abolished in the presence of anti-Trx antibodies. We also studied the combined effect of NO and Trx on IRP2, which exhibits constitutive RNA binding activity. We observed an inhibition of IRP2 activity following exposure to NO donors which was restored by Trx. Collectively, these results point to a crucial role of Trx as a modulator of IRP activity in situations of NO production.

In iron-depleted cells, high affinity of IRP1 for IREs diminishes iron storage in ferritin and induces transferrin receptor synthesis, thereby enhancing iron uptake via receptor-mediated endocytosis of serum transferrin. Conversely, in iron-loaded cells IRP1 fails to bind RNA but functions as an aconitase, converting citrate into isocitrate in the cytosol (1Kühn L.C. Hentze M.W. J. Inorg.

IRP1 is thus a bifunctional protein whose activities appear to depend on the presence or absence of an intact [4Fe-4S] cluster (12Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1442-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) which is ligated by three cysteine residues at the active site (13Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C.

The second IRP discovered, IRP2, shares 61% amino acid identity with IRP1, differing by the insertion of a 73-amino acid sequence rich in cysteine residues (15Guo B. Brown F.M. Phillips J.D. Yu Y.

Although IRP2 contains the three conserved cysteine ligands for the [4Fe-4S] cluster of IRP1, it seems not to have such a cluster, and it lacks aconitase activity (17Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol.

It is now clear that signals other than iron can regulate IRP1 and IRP2 activities and thus modulate cellular iron metabolism. Indeed, previous studies showed that biosynthesis of NO, oxidative stress, and phosphorylation increase IRP1/IRE binding in different cell types (20Drapier J.C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As regards stimulation by NO, previous results from our laboratory showed that IRE binding by IRP1 is almost maximal when NO synthase 2 is induced in macrophages by stimulation with both interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide (20Drapier J.C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The conversion of IRP1 from holo- to apoprotein can also be elicited in vitro by exposing cell cytoplasmic extracts to NO-releasing chemicals. However, despite high concentrations of NO donor, we consistently observed that IRP1 activation under these conditions was far from that observed in intact cells (27Bouton C. Raveau M. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, exposure of purified recombinant IRP1 to NO donors or to NO gas resulted in an even weaker IRP1 activation (20Drapier J.C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). It seems therefore that simplification of the experimental system results in the loss of a cellular component that plays a part in NO-mediated IRP1 activation. Moreover, it is also worth recalling that IRP1 and IRP2 are redox-sensitive proteins. Indeed, it has long been known that high concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) fully activate IRP1 in vitro (28Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Conversely, IRP1 is inhibited in its ability to bind IREs following treatment with the sulfhydryl-modifying oxidant diamide or by alkylation (13Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Philpott C.C. Haile D. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1992; 208: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that Cys437, one of the three cysteines that hold the iron-sulfur cluster, must be reduced to allow IRP1 to bind IREs (13Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar,14Philpott C.C. Haile D. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17655-17658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As regards IRP2, its regulation mainly proceeds through proteasome-dependent degradation (16Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 30Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), but recent evidence indicates that it is also activable to some extent by reducing agents (26Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15704-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that endogenous redox systems may play a part in the process of IRP activation. Here, we first investigated the capacity of endogenous reducing systems to cooperate with NO in IRP1 activation. We focused on two major physiological reducing systems, i.e. reduced glutathione and the thioredoxin (Trx)/Trx reductase system. Trx is a 12-kDa protein present in many species from plants to mammals which functions as a major protein disulfide reductase within cells (34Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that reduced Trx strongly enhances the RNA binding activity of IRP1 exposed to NO donors. In addition, we observed an inhibition of IRP2 activity after exposure to NO in vitro, which was restored by the Trx system. 3-Morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1) was synthesized by Cassella AG (Frankfurt, Germany) and kindly provided by J. Winicki, Hoechst, France.S-Nitroso-l-glutathione (GSNO) and diethylamine NONOate (DEANO) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Bovine thioredoxin reductase (TR), Escherichia colithioredoxin (Trx), and goat anti-human Trx antibody were from IMCO Corp. (Stockholm, Sweden). Bovine erythrocyte Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), insulin, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. The mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) supplemented with 5% low endotoxin fetal calf serum. Mitochondria-free cytosolic extracts were prepared as described previously (35Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments lysate was concentrated by ultrafiltration on microconcentrators (Microsep, Ultrafiltron, Northborough, MA, molecular mass cut-off, 30 kDa). Cytosolic extract (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with NO-generating compounds at 37 °C for different times in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. In the case of SIN-1, experiments were always performed in the presence of 3000 units/ml SOD (referred to as SIN-1/SOD). Under these conditions the production of peroxynitrite, the coupling product of the reaction between NO and O·̄2 released by SIN-1, was reduced by 95–98%, as testified by the rhodamine assay (36Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Production of nitrite, one of the end products of NO, was followed to test the efficacy of the NO donor. Samples treated with NO donors were routinely desalted on P-6 Bio-Spin chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) prior to exposure to Trx. Reactions with the Trx system, containing various concentrations of Trx (oxidized form), 1 nm TR, and 0.4 mm NADPH, were performed at 37 °C for 20 min. These reaction conditions were sufficient to reduce oxidized Trx fully, as indicated by the insulin disulfide reduction assay. Disulfide reduction by thioredoxin was evaluated by the insulin reduction assay (37Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.4 mm NADPH, 1 nm TR, and different concentrations of Trx were incubated with 9 units/ml insulin in 2 mm EDTA, 80 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, for 20 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 120 μl. The reaction was terminated by addition of 0.5 ml of 0.4 mg/ml 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 6m guanidine hydrochloride in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the absorbance at 412 nm was measured. The expression vector for recombinant IRP1 (rIRP1) has been constructed in the laboratory of Dr. Lukas C. Kühn (Epalinges, Switzerland). rIRP1 was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in E. coli and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column as described (13Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Purified rIRP1 was incubated with NO donors in 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. After desalting on a P-6 Bio-Spin column, rIRP was exposed to the Trx system under the same conditions as described above. A 32P-labeled IRE probe was generated by in vitro transcription from the plasmid pSPT-fer that contains the IRE sequence of human ferritin H-chain (kindly provided by Dr. L. C. Kühn, Switzerland). Plasmid was linearized by BamHI and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 50 μCi of [32P]CTP (NEN Life Science Products). The IRP-IRE interactions were analyzed as described previously (4Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 9Müllner E.W. Neupert B. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) by incubating 2 μg of cytoplasmic protein with a molar excess (0.1 ng = 40,000 cpm) of 32P-labeled ferritin IRE probe in 20 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, and 5% glycerol. IRP·IRE complexes were resolved on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. In parallel experiments, samples were treated with 2-ME at a final concentration of 2% prior to the addition of the RNA probe. The IRP·IRE complexes were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Electrophoretic mobility shift experiments were performed at least three times, and one representative experiment is shown. The aconitase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by following the disappearance ofcis-aconitate at 240 nm at 37 °C as described (35Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of nitrite, one of the end products of nitric oxide, was determined spectrophotometrically at 543 nm, using the Griess reagent containing final concentrations of 0.5% sulfanilamide and 0.05% N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine hydrochloride in 45% acetic acid. The protein content of cytoplasmic extracts was determined spectrophotometrically at 595 nm, using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. We consistently observed that the IRE binding activity of IRP1 in cytosolic lysates was little enhanced by treatment with NO donors like SIN-1/SOD when lysates had been previously concentrated on a membrane with an M r cut-off of 30,000 (Fig.1, lane 2). Furthermore, when filtrate containing low molecular weight fractions (LF) was added back to the retentate (HF), the capacity to bind IREs after NO treatment was largely increased (lane 4). LF had little, if any, effect on HF from control cell extracts (lane 3). We therefore considered the hypothesis that LF contained a constitutive component with an M r <30,000 able to activate an NO-primed pool of IRP1. RAW 264.7 cell cytosol was first incubated with SIN-1 together with SOD. Cytosolic extracts were subsequently exposed to increasing concentrations of GSH or Trx in the presence of TR and NADPH and analyzed for IRP1 IRE binding activity. As expected from previous experiments (27Bouton C. Raveau M. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the incubation with SIN-1/SOD for 1 h induced an approximately 2-fold increase in the IRE binding activity of IRP1 relative to the control (Fig. 2,A and B, compare lanes 5 and1). Addition of up to 1 mm reduced glutathione to cell lysate had only a marginal effect on IRP1 IRE binding. When lysate had been previously exposed to an NO-generating system, GSH had a slight but consistent effect at high concentration (≥1 mm) (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, a strong enhancement of IRP1 activity (up to 6 times the control value) was observed when SIN-1/SOD-pretreated cytosolic extracts were exposed to increasing concentrations of Trx for 20 min (Fig. 2 B, see lane 8). Under these conditions, control IRP1 kept its IRE binding capacity low (lanes 1–4) and aconitase activity high (not shown). The modulation of IRP1 activity by Trx after exposure to SIN-1/SOD required electron transfer from NADPH through TR, since omission of one component of the thioredoxin system, either NADPH, or TR, or Trx itself, did not induce any further increase in IRP1/IRE binding (not shown). When Trx was added before or together with the NO donor, its contribution was not significant. The level of nitrite released was diminished, suggesting that added Trx partially scavenged NO. In a set of time course experiments, cytosolic extracts were incubated with SIN-1/SOD for increasing periods before exposure to Trx. As can be seen in Fig. 3, IRE binding activity of SIN-1/SOD-treated IRP1, which reached 50% of the full activity expressed in the presence of 2% 2-ME within 30 min, was almost maximal (90%) when cell cytosol was subsequently exposed to 5 μmTrx. This enhancement of IRP1 activity induced by Trx in SIN-1/SOD-treated cytosolic extracts correlated with NO production which was assessed spectrophotometrically by measuring nitrite production (Fig. 3, bottom). To investigate further if NO is a prerequisite in rendering IRP1 sensitive to Trx, we tested two other types of NO donors that do not release oxygen-derived reactive molecules: the fast NO-releasing compound diethylamine NONOate (DEANO), andS-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a product derived from a physiologically relevant thiol. As shown in Fig.4 A, the IRE binding activity of IRP1 was moderately increased after incubation with 1 mmDEANO (27% of the total binding as compared with 10% for non-treated samples). Exposure to the full components of the Trx system strongly enhanced IRP1 activity in DEANO-treated samples (compare lanes 4–6, upper). Likewise, addition of Trx to cytosolic extracts previously exposed to GSNO induced a marked increase in IRP1/IRE binding, whereas no effect could be detected with GSNO alone (Fig.3 B). Surprisingly, we consistently noted a faster mobility of the IRP1·IRE complex present in GSNO-treated extracts (lane 4). After exposure to the Trx system, this shift in the electrophoretic mobility was eliminated in a concentration-dependent manner for Trx (lanes 4–6). To rule out any interference from other cytosolic components in the activation of IRP1 by Trx, recombinant IRP1 (rIRP1) was purified using a bacterial expression system and exposed to the Trx system after preincubation with GSNO or SIN-1/SOD. As shown in Fig.5, incubation of rIRP1 with GSNO or SIN-1/SOD slightly increased rIRP1/IRE binding. However, when GSNO- or SIN-1/SOD-pretreated rIRP1 was further exposed to Trx, IRE binding activity was dramatically enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. Increase in IRE binding after treatment with Trx did not occur with control rIRP1. These experiments demonstrate that electrons provided by the Trx system directly activate the RNA binding of IRP1 previously exposed to NO generators. To gain further insights into the role of endogenous Trx in NO-dependent IRP1 activation, we treated cytosolic lysates with anti-Trx antibodies before exposure to SIN-1/SOD. As shown in Fig.6, incubation of cell cytosols with anti-Trx antibodies abolished the increase of RNA binding activity of IRP1 routinely observed after treatment with SIN-1/SOD (Fig. 6, comparelanes 3 and 4). It is therefore clear from this result that endogenous Trx allows activation of IRP1 in concert with NO. RNA binding activity of IRP2 can be inactivated by treatment with sulfhydryl-modifying compounds and oxidants (26Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20509-20515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Bouton C. Hirling H. Drapier J.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15704-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether IRP2 activity could also be affected by NO and Trx. As shown in Fig. 7, treatment of RAW 264.7 cell cytosol with DEANO decreased IRE binding activity of IRP2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Neither incubation of cell cytosol with 500 μm diethylamine nor exposure to stable end products of DEANO decomposition inhibited IRE binding activity of IRP2 (not shown). The lower activity of IRP2 upon DEANO treatment was not a consequence of protein degradation as it could be restored after incubation with 0.5% 2-ME, which reveals maximal IRP2/IRE binding (32Bouton C. Hirling H. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19969-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IRP2 activity was also restored after exposure of DEANO-treated cell cytosol to 5 μm Trx in the presence of TR and NADPH. Similar results were obtained with other NO donors like GSNO (data not shown). It is worth noting that, contrary to what was observed for IRP1, Trx enhanced RNA binding activity of control IRP2. Relatively little is known about the cellular mechanism that drives IRPs to modulate translation and turnover of IRE-containing mRNA. As largely documented before, the mode of activation/inactivation of IRP1 can be explained, at least in part, by the removal/insertion of a [4Fe-4S] cluster (38Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Yet it is well established that IRP1 activation requires reduction of cysteine residues (13Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Philpott C.C. Haile D. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17655-17658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Overall, it emerged from these studies that cluster removal may not be sufficient to give IRP1 the proper conformation required to fit the stem-loop-shaped IREs. We previously demonstrated that in response to NO synthesis, IRP1 loses aconitase activity but gains IRE binding capacity (20Drapier J.C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). To explain this change, we proposed that NO or a related nitrosating species directly destabilizes the Fe-S cluster of IRP1. As regards IRP2, in vitro experiments revealed that it is also activable to some extent by reducing agents (26Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15704-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and inhibited by peroxynitrite, an NO-derived oxidant (32Bouton C. Hirling H. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19969-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the capacity of two major endogenous reducing systems, i.e. GSH and Trx, to promote or at least participate in concert with NO in IRP activation. First, we found that addition of GSH to macrophage lysate had only a marginal effect on IRP1/IRE binding in vitro, thus confirming previous data (29Müllner E.W. Rothenberger S. Muller A.M. Kühn L.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, when cell cytosols were pretreated with NO donors, no significant effect of GSH on IRP1 activity was detected below the millimolar range. These results imply that modulation of the glutathione pool is not a major parameter which interferes with IRP1 activity. Rather, our data point to reduced thioredoxin as a potent modulator of IRP activity. Trx is a multifunctional enzyme involved in a vast array of biological functions ranging from hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase activity to immunostimulatory effects (39Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Yodoi J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Yet its main function is a disulfide reductase activity. By so doing, it allows refolding of disulfide bridge-containing proteins (40Pigiet V.P. Schuster B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and modulation of the DNA binding activity of several redox-sensitive transcription factors including NF-kB, AP-1 via reduction of Ref-1, glucocorticoid receptor, or heat shock factor-1 (41Schenk H. Klein M. Erdbrugger W. Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 42Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 43Packer L. Sen C.K. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 44Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 11: 2469-2477Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 45Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Polla B.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Trx by itself had little direct effect on IRP1. The low amount of IRP1 activated directly by reduced Trx in some experiments probably corresponded to a fraction of apo-IRP1 which spontaneously underwent oxidation. Interestingly, addition of low concentrations of Trx to IRP1 markedly enhanced the effect of different classes of NO donors on IRE binding. It is noteworthy that GSNO had two effects on IRP1 as follows: (i) like the other NO donors, it predisposed IRP1 to IRE binding upon further reduction, and (ii) it yielded a modification in the protein characterized by a downward shift in the polyacrylamide gel migration. Migration returned to normal after exposure to 2% 2-ME or 10 μm Trx. It is tempting to speculate that trans-nitrosation mediated by GSNO promoted formation of two different disulfide bridges. One would mostly affect binding to IRE by oxidizing at least one allosteric thiol close or belonging to the IRE-binding domain. Another disulfide bond, selectively formed by GSNO, may affect vicinal thiols distal from the IRE-binding domain. The structural change that may result from the latter does not seem to be crucial for activity as it did not affect RNA binding capacity and may not be effective in the presence of reduced Trx. Besides, we observed that sequential exposure of IRP1 to NO and reduced Trx led to the largest increase in IRP1/IRE binding. This is probably due to the fact that Trx must be maintained reduced by TR and NADPH. Such a situation was previously encountered with H2O2-enhanced DNA binding of heat shock factor-1 (45Jacquier-Sarlin M.R. Polla B.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is likely that combining an NO generator with exogenously added Trx can partially overcome the reducing capacity of the latter. Indeed, as pointed out by Nikitovic and Holmgren (46Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19180-19185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), reaction of GSNO with Trx leads to homolytic cleavage with release of NO and inhibition of the TR/Trx system. Further evidence for a physiological role of Trx in IRP1 activation was provided by the use of specific anti-Trx antibodies. Indeed, neutralization of endogenous Trx prevented NO-mediated activation of IRE binding by IRP1. Enhancement of IRP1 RNA binding activity in response to high concentrations of reducers such as dithiothreitol or 2-ME has long been known (28Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), but intriguingly neither low levels of these chemicals nor physiologically relevant reducers have been shown to reproduce this effect. The major obstacle to mild reduction is probably the presence of the Fe-S cluster which, in partnership with substrate (e.g. citrate), prevents access to the sensitive thiols,i.e. Cys437, Cys503 and Cys506 (13Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Even at high concentrations, 2-ME is not able to remove the cluster since after filtration on a G-25 column, IRP1 still needs a high concentration of 2-ME to bind IREs (13Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which is characteristic of a cluster-containing form of IRP1. In fact, IRP1 becomes readily sensitive to low amounts of 2-ME only after cluster removal (13Hirling H. Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Apart from the two classical forms of IRP1,i.e. the [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 (aconitase) and the apo-IRP1 (IRE-binding regulator), a [3Fe-4S] cluster-containing IRP1 was described (47Kennedy M.C. Mende-Mueller L. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11730-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 48Toth I. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19540-19544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, recent evidence from several laboratories including ours has indicated that an oxidized form of apo-IRP1 exists in vitro (32Bouton C. Hirling H. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19969-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 49Schalinske K.L. Anderson S.A. Tuazon P.T. Chen O.S. Kennedy M.C. Eisenstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3950-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 50Cairo G. Castrusini E. Minotti G. Bernelli-Zazzera A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1326-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and in living cells (26Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This form of IRP1 has been assigned to a cluster-free protein whose oxidation of sulfhydryl groups at the active site confers on it neither aconitase activity nor IRE binding capacity. We recently showed that such an IRP1 also exists after exposure to peroxynitrite (32Bouton C. Hirling H. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19969-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this form of IRP1, oxidation of Cys437 by peroxynitrite would prevent IRE binding. We proposed that this oxidized apo-IRP1 is a latent form rapidly available to bind IREs upon physiologic reduction (32Bouton C. Hirling H. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19969-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, thus far the nature of this reduction has remained enigmatic. The data presented here suggest that reduced Trx acts in partnership with NO or NO-derived oxidizing species to activate IRP1 within cells. Moreover, the fact that Trx activates a pool of IRP1 previously exposed to NO provides an explanation for a somewhat paradoxical situation. Indeed, NO is a signaling molecule that, in the presence of oxygen, can yield oxidizing or nitrosating reactive species which form S-nitrosothiol adducts and/or disulfides on proteins. Higher oxides derived from NO, like peroxynitrite, may also yield sulfenic or sulfinic groups (51Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore intriguing that NO or related products alone could activate IRP1, which needs to be reduced prior to binding IREs. Whether critical sulfhydryls of IRP1 are S-nitrosylated or oxidized to sulfenic or sulfinic acids in NO-producing cells remains to be determined, but since the disulfide-reducing Trx was able to generate full RNA binding activity, the most likely conclusion is that nitrogen oxides, in addition to disrupting the cluster, also interact with the cluster-coordinating cysteines Cys503, Cys506, and Cys437 to promote a disulfide bridge. We anticipate that such a bridge should link Cys437 and either Cys503 or Cys506. Our results point to the Trx system as the most effective reducing system ultimately to activate such an oxidized apo-IRP1. IRP2 has the same specificity as IRP1 and, despite the fact that it is generally less abundant than IRP1 (52Henderson B.R. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), it can regulate cellular iron metabolism by itself, as recently shown in IRP1-lacking cells (53Schalinske K.L. Blemings K.P. Steffen D.W. Chen O.S. Eisenstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10681-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, its effect on ferritin expression may prevail (54Recalcati S. Taramelli D. Conte D. Cairo G. Blood. 1998; 91: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been recently proposed that IRP2 rather than IRP1 is involved in abnormal iron distribution in the brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (55Smith M.A. Wehr K. Harris P.L.R. Siedlak S.L. Connor J.R. Perry G. Brain Res. 1998; 788: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). IRP2, in contrast to IRP1, does not possess an Fe-S cluster but has the 3 corresponding cysteines which in IRP1 anchor the cluster and, remarkably, 5 cysteine residues in its specific insertion sequence (16Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Its activity was enhanced in vitroafter exposure to 2-ME or dithiothreitol (26Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15704-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and in vivo, in a model of acute inflammation (56Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As macrophages can produce both NO and large amounts of reactive oxygen species, it is therefore relevant to consider carefully the effect of physiological reactive mediators such as NO on IRP2. Here, we showed an inhibition of RNA binding of IRP2 in macrophage cytosol following exposure to NO donors. Inhibition was reversed by reduced Trx but not by GSH. Trx/TR-dependent reduction of intracellular disulfide may therefore regenerate IRP2/IRE binding activity of macrophages exposed to situations where oxidizing species can be generated, e.g.when they migrate into inflammatory areas or secrete oxidants during phagocytosis or after stimulation by chemotactic factors. In conclusion, these findings provide a decisive clue to the regulation of IRPs. We propose that NO and Trx cooperate to regulate IRP function(s). A few examples already exist where the NO/Trx tandem has been shown to modulate efficiently enzyme or transcription factor activity (57Patel J.M. Zhang J. Block E.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 410-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 58Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. Spyrou G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is likely that Trx-catalyzed disulfide reduction of IRPs previously oxidized by nitrogen or oxygen-derived species represents a novel example of coordinated regulation of gene expression.

Two of these, the heavy chains 1 and 2 (H1 and H2), are of 75–80 kDa and have similar amino acid sequences. The third polypeptide, bikunin, has a molecular mass of 25 kDa and contains a 7-kDa chondroitin sulfate chain that is covalently linked to the C-terminal amino acid residues of H1 and H2. IαI has been shown to be required for the formation of the hyaluronan-containing extracellular matrix of certain cell types. How IαI exerts this function is not known, but it appears that upon interaction with cells, the heavy chains are released and become covalently linked to hyaluronan. Our results indicate that IαI and its heavy chains are extended molecules; thus, upon electron microscopy, IαI appeared to consist of two globular domains connected by a thin structure 31-nm long and the isolated heavy chains of a globular domain and a “tail” about 15-nm long. Analysis of the heavy chains by partial proteolysis showed that the C-terminal halves are particularly sensitive to hydrolysis indicating that they are loosely folded. Furthermore, electron microscopy showed that partially degraded heavy chains lacked the extended regions.

Inter-α-inhibitor (IαI)1 is a plasma protein synthesized by hepatocytes. It consists of bikunin, which has a molecular mass of about 25 kDa (1Olsen E.H.N. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Thogersen I.B. Roepstorff P. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 2Lindström K.E. Blom A. Johnsson E. Haraldsson B. Fries E.

Raguenez G. Daveau M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Bikunin carries a 7-kDa chondroitin sulfate chain (4Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Thogersen I.B.

Balduyck M. Sautiere P. Kouach M. Michalski C. Fournet B. Mizon J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments with isolated hepatocytes have shown that the coupling of bikunin to the heavy chains occurs in the Golgi complex immediately after the chondroitin sulfate chain has been completed (7Sjöberg E.M. Fries E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol.

Klin. Wochenschr. 1977; 55: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), is a proteinase inhibitor with a wide specificity range but with relatively low affinity to the proteolytic enzymes tested so far (10Potempa J. Kwon K. Chawla R. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15109-15114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although IαI was isolated more than 30 years ago (11Steinbuch M. Loeb J. Nature. 1961; 192: 1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), its physiological role is still unclear (for a review see Ref. 3Salier J.-P. Rouet P. Raguenez G. Daveau M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recent findings indicate that this protein is required for the maturation of oocytes; in vitro experiments have shown that IαI stabilizes the hyaluronan-containing extracellular matrix that is formed by the cells surrounding the oocytes (12Chen L. Mao S.J. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12380-12386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the capillaries near the follicles become leaky to plasma proteins during ovulation supports the idea that the observed effect occursin vivo (13Chen L. Mao S.J. McLean L.R. Powers R.W. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28282-28287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IαI has also been shown to be required for the formation of the hyaluronan-containing structure that surrounds fibroblasts and mesothelial cells (14Blom A. Pertoft H. Fries E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9698-9701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The physiological role of these coats is unclear, but it has been suggested that they may protect against compression (15Lee G.M. Johnstone B. Jacobson K. Caterson B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), promote cell migration (16Banerjee S.D. Toole B.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and help to keep cells separated (15Lee G.M. Johnstone B. Jacobson K. Caterson B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is not clear in what way IαI stabilizes this extracellular structure, but it appears that when the bikunin-containing proteins interact with cells, the bikunin moiety is displaced by hyaluronan molecules that become covalently linked to the heavy chains (17Huang L. Yoneda M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26725-26730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chen L. Zhang H. Powers R.W. Russell P.T. Larsen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19409-19414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recent observations have indicated that IαI may also play a role in inflammation. Thus hyaluronan isolated from the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis has been found to contain covalently linked heavy chains (19Jessen T.E. Odum L. Johnsen A.H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Zhao M. Yoneda M. Okashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26657-26663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, upon inflammation, fibroblasts and monocytes secrete a protein named TSG-6, which reacts with IαI by displacing H1 and forming a covalent link with the chondroitin sulfate of bikunin (21Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Upon this reaction, the ability of bikunin to inhibit plasmin is enhanced, and the formed complex appears to have a strong anti-inflammatory capacity (22Wisniewski H. Hua J.-C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular details of the interactions of IαI and TSG-6 are still unknown. For further functional studies of IαI, detailed structural information will be helpful. The amino acid sequences of the heavy chains and bikunin are known, as are the structures of their glycans and disulfide arrangements (1Olsen E.H.N. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Thogersen I.B. Roepstorff P. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23Wachter E. Hochstrasser K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1981; 362: 1351-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the conformation of IαI and its isolated heavy chains with various techniques. Chymotrypsin and elastase from pig pancreas were purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim. Thermolysin (type X) was from Sigma, hyaluronidase from ovine testes from Calbiochem, and chondroitinase AC II Arthro from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan. For the isolation of IαI, a side fraction from the commercial production of factor IX was used (kindly provided by I.-M. Lööf; Pharmacia-Upjohn, Stockholm, Sweden). After dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and removal of insoluble protein, this material was subjected to gel filtration on Sepharose S-400, which yielded pure IαI. For the release of the heavy chains, 2m NaOH was added to a solution of IαI (1 mg/ml in PBS) to give a final concentration of 0.05 m (24Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15975-15981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 15 min at room temperature, Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added to yield a final concentration of 0.25 m. Alternatively, one volume of IαI (1 mg/ml in PBS) was mixed with two volumes of 0.4 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, followed by the addition of chondroitinase and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to yield the final concentrations 20 milliunits/ml and 0.2 mm, respectively (25Balduyck M. Laroui S. Mizon C. Mizon J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated for 20 h at 37 °C. The sample was then dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, and applied to an anion exchange gel (MonoQ HR 5/5; Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer. The proteins were eluted at 4 °C at a linear flow rate of 20 cm × h−1 with 100 ml of a gradient from 0 to 0.7 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6 (26Balduyck M. Piva F. Mizon C. Maes P. Malki N. Gressier B. Michalski C. Mizon J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Unless specified otherwise, protein concentrations were determined by UV measurements. The absorbance coefficients for the protein moieties of IαI, H1, and H2 were calculated from the amino acid compositions (Lasergene, DNASTAR Inc.). The published carbohydrate contents were then used for the calculation of the corresponding values for the whole proteins: 0.60, 0.47, and 0.72 mg−1 ml cm−1, respectively. The protein solutions were stored at −20 °C until they were used for experiments. The proteins were applied to a Superdex 200 gel (3.2/30; Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with PBS at a flow rate of 50 μl/min; the absorbances at 280, 254, and 214 nm of the eluate were continuously measured. Thymidine and blue dextran were used as a markers forV t and V 0, respectively. Calibration curves for Stokes radius and molecular mass were obtained with thyroglobulin (8.5 nm, 668 kDa), ferritin (6.1 nm, 440 kDa), catalase (5.2 nm, 232 kDa), aldolase (4.8 nm, 158 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (3.55 nm, 67 kDa), all were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech. After thawing the protein samples, proteinase inhibitors were added: 0.1 m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 5 mm N-ethylmalemide, 5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The solutions were then dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against 0.2 mNH4HCO3, pH 7.9. Glycerol spraying and rotary shadowing were performed as described previously (27Engel J. Furthmayr H. Cunningham L.W. Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 3-78Google Scholar, 28Fowler W.E. Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 29Shotton D.M.

Res. 1980; 71: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Briefly, buffer and glycerol were added to make the final concentrations of protein and glycerol 5 μg/ml and 400 ml/liter, respectively. The contrast was increased by the addition of polyethylene glycol 1500 (0.01 g/liter). The samples were sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica pieces, dried in vacuo and rotary shadowed at 9° with carbon/platinum through electron bombardment heating in a Balzers BAF 400 D freeze etching device. The samples were observed in a Jeol 1200 EX electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage. Evaluation of the data from the electron micrographs was done as described previously (27Engel J. Furthmayr H. Cunningham L.W. Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 3-78Google Scholar). For the selective removal of bikunin from IαI, the procedure of Enghild et al. (24Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15975-15981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used: a sample containing 0.9 mg/ml IαI and 6 μg/ml hyaluronidase in PBS was incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C. H2 was selectively removed by elastase digestion essentially as described by Balduyck et al. (26Balduyck M. Piva F. Mizon C. Maes P. Malki N. Gressier B. Michalski C. Mizon J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:1,000 with the conditions described below for digestion of the isolated heavy chains. Limited chymotrypsin digestion of H1 was done as described below with an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:50. Subsequent electrophoretic analysis of the different protein samples showed bands with the expected apparent molecular masses. 2 μl of a solution with different concentrations of enzyme was added to 18 μl of a solution containing heavy chain (0.4 mg/ml) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2 to give various molar ratios of enzyme to heavy chain. After 150 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 2 mm. The reaction was performed as for chymotrypsin, except the buffer was 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 50 mm NaCl and 20 mm CaCl2. The reaction was performed as for chymotrypsin, except the buffer was 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl. The reaction was performed as for elastase but was terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. After proteolysis, the proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gels in Tricine buffer (31Schägger H. Jagow G.v. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The proteins were stained or transferred by electrophoresis onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Problott; Applied Biosystems; Foster City, California). The membrane was stained, and the appropriate bands excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing in a 476 A amino acid sequenator (Applied Biosystems). Samples containing 0.1–0.3 mg/ml protein were dialyzed against 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), and the protein concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Circular dichroism spectra were obtained at room temperature on a JASCO-720 spectropolarimeter with a 0.1 cm cell. Data points were collected from 250 to 190 nm in 0.5 nm intervals at a rate of 50 nm/min; for each spectrum, 10 scans were performed and added. The percentages of secondary structural elements were estimated with the method of variable selection using a data base of 22 proteins with known secondary structure (32Manavalan P. Johnson W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 33Hennessey J.P. Johnson W.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Analysis of IαI, H1, and H2 by gel filtration (Fig.1 A) showed that more than 90% of the applied material eluted as one peak. Based on their amino acid sequences and known carbohydrate contents, the molecular masses of the constituents of IαI (H1, H2, and bikunin) are 77, 78 (1Olsen E.H.N. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Thogersen I.B. Roepstorff P. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and 25 kDa (1Olsen E.H.N. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Thogersen I.B. Roepstorff P. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 2Lindström K.E. Blom A. Johnsson E. Haraldsson B. Fries E. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1053-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), respectively, yielding a total mass of 180 kDa for the whole protein. The gel filtration experiments showed that IαI, H1, and H2 behave like globular proteins of 350 ± 7, 100 ± 4, and 140 ± 1 kDa (Fig. 1 B, ○; three determinations) indicating that they have extended structures. The corresponding Stokes radii are 6.4 ± 0.2, 3.8 ± 0.2, and 4.5 ± 0.1 nm, respectively (Fig. 1 B, •). The ratios between these radii and those of spherical proteins of the same masses, the frictional ratios, are 1.7, 1.4, and 1.6, respectively (34Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). IαI molecules visualized by rotary shadowing (Fig.2, A and B) showed particles with a diameter of 11 ± 2 nm. Most of these (63%) occurred pairwise joined by a thin strand. The average distance between the centers of the particles measured along the strand (Fig.3 A, shaded bars) was 42 ± 8 nm (Fig. 3 B) implying that the strand was about 31-nm long. In the middle of the strand, there was a small globular structure the size of which was at the limit of the resolution of the method (Fig. 2 B, arrowheads). To test the idea that this globule was bikunin, IαI was subjected to limited hyaluronidase treatment, which has previously been shown to selectively remove bikunin (24Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15975-15981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, the treated molecules lacked the globule, 95% of the total number. To further test the identity of the structures seen by electron microscopy, H2 was specifically released from IαI by limited elastase digestion (26Balduyck M. Piva F. Mizon C. Maes P. Malki N. Gressier B. Michalski C. Mizon J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 D shows that this treatment leads to the disappearance of one of the large globular domains, whereas the small globule remained (indicated by arrowheads). Isolated H1 studied with the same technique (Fig. 2, E and F) displayed a globular domain (diameter, 11 ± 2 nm) with a thin tail; the average length of the molecule (Fig. 3 A, open bars) was 20 ± 5 nm (Fig. 3 B), the tail being about 15 nm. Mild proteolytic treatment of H1 (Fig. 2 G) resulted in removal of the tail, whereas the size of the globular domain seemed unaffected. Apparently identical results were obtained with H2 (data not shown). The extended structure of IαI and its isolated heavy chains was also seen with negatively stained material (data not shown).Figure 3Size distribution of molecular structures seen by electron microscopy.

Fassina G. Vita C. Dalzoppo D. Zamai M. Zambonin M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1847-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Partial proteolysis can therefore be used for the structural analysis of proteins. Fig. 4 A shows the effect of incubating H1 with increasing amounts of different proteinases as judged by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Upon treatment at a molar ratio of thermolysin to H1 of 1:1,000 (lane 2), the apparent molecular mass of the major band shifted from 79 to 74 kDa, and three groups of bands of about 60, 40, and 29 kDa appeared. The separated fragments were transferred to a membrane and the N-terminal sequences of two of these (denotedt 1 and t 2) were determined. The obtained sequences were the same as the N-terminal sequence of the intact protein (Fig. 4 B) showing that the fragments had been formed by C-terminal truncation (Fig.4 C). Increasing the relative amount of the enzyme 10-fold (lane 4) resulted in the disappearance oft 1, t 2 (and other, larger fragments) and the appearance of three major bands of 27, 18, and 10 kDa (denoted t 3, t 4, andt 5). Sequence analysis showed thatt 3 was an N-terminal fragment and thatt 4 and t 5 were the C- and N-terminal halves of t 3 (Fig. 4, Band C). Further increases in the enzyme concentration lead to the disappearance of t 3 and a simultaneous increase of t 4 and t 5(lanes 5 and 6). As judged by its apparent molecular mass on SDS-PAGE, t 4 appears to extend beyond the C terminus of t 3 (Fig. 4 C). Whether this is actually the case or whether t 4 behaves anomalously upon electrophoresis remains to be clarified. Treatment of H1 with chymotrypsin (lanes 8–12) yielded fragments with apparent molecular masses close to those obtained with thermolysin (bandsc 1-c 4). Their positions within the molecule were essentially the same as those found for thermolysin (Fig. 4, B and C). The fragments generated by treating H1 with elastase (lanes 14–18) or trypsin (not shown) were similar in size to those obtained with the two other enzymes; their N-terminal amino acid sequences were not determined. We also used partial proteolysis to probe the structure of H2 (Fig.5 A). At a thermolysin/H2 ratio of 1:10,000, a number of bands in the range of 80–40 kDa were formed (lane 2). Some of these (collectively denotedt 1) were analyzed by amino acid sequencing and found to have the N terminus of the intact polypeptide (Fig. 5,B and C). It should be noted that this degradation occurred at a proteinase concentration ten times lower than that required to achieve a similar effect on H1. When the concentration of enzyme was increased (lanes 3–5), new bands appeared (t 2-t 4) apparently through truncation of the C-terminal end. At the highest proteinase concentrations used (lane 5), cleavage near the N terminus also took place (band t 4). Similar results were obtained with chymotrypsin (lanes 8–10) and elastase (lanes 13–15). The relative content of secondary structures in the heavy chains was assessed by circular dichroism measurements. The spectra of the two proteins were essentially identical (Fig.6). The relative occurrence of different secondary structures were obtained by fitting the spectra to those of proteins with known secondary structure (32Manavalan P. Johnson W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 33Hennessey J.P. Johnson W.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Three determinations were performed yielding values varying less than 2%. The estimated uncertainty in the procedure was less than 7% for each type of structure. This analysis yielded the following results: 34% α-helix, 11% anti-parallel β-sheets, 8% parallel β-sheets, 16% turns, and 32% unordered structures; similar compositions have been obtained for globular proteins (36Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). In this study, we have found that IαI and its isolated heavy chains behave as extended molecules in free solution; their Stokes radii as estimated by gel filtration are 40–70% larger than those of globular proteins of the same mass. These results are supported by electron microscopy, which shows that IαI consists of two globular domains connected by a thin flexible structure (Fig. 2, Aand B). With the same technique, the isolated heavy chains seem to consist of a globular domain of the same size as those in IαI and of a thin tail whose length is about half that of the strand connecting the globular domains in the whole molecule (Fig. 2,E and F). These tails appear to be the C-terminal ends of the polypeptides, because upon treatment of the heavy chains with low concentrations of proteinases, the C-terminal parts of the polypeptides are degraded (Figs. 4 C and 5 C) and the extended regions seen by electron microscopy removed (Fig.2 G). Biochemical analysis has shown that the C-terminal ends of the two heavy chains in IαI are covalently linked to the chondroitin sulfate chain of bikunin (6Morelle W. Capon C. Balduyck M. Sautiere P. Kouach M. Michalski C. Fournet B. Mizon J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the electron micrographs of IαI, a small globule can be seen in the middle of the strand connecting the larger globular domains (Fig. 2 B,arrowheads). This structure appears to be bikunin, because it is not present in molecules subjected to mild hyaluronidase digestion (Fig. 2 C), a treatment selectively releasing the bikunin moiety (24Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15975-15981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the chondroitin sulfate chain of bikunin constitutes part of the thread-like structure between the globular domains in IαI. However, the finding that the sizes of the isolated heavy chains are about half of the whole molecule indicates that the contribution of the polysaccharide is small; the fact that the bikunin polypeptide is selectively released upon mild hyaluronidase treatment might be because of the heavy chains being linked to the chondroitin sulfate chain at relatively closely located sites (24Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15975-15981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for our results is that the release of the heavy chains from IαI was incomplete and that the tails are bikunin. However, the observation that the heavy chains ran as homogeneous bands upon SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of the expected value argues against this possibility. In this study, we used two procedures for releasing the heavy chains from IαI: short exposure to high pH and chondroitinase digestion. The former method is the simpler to perform but could possibly bring about conformational changes. However, we have not been able to detect any such differences between heavy chains prepared by either procedure. Our results suggest that the heavy chains of IαI have a club-like structure. There are numerous examples of proteins of this kind. For example, the subunit of the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), which has a molecular mass of about 120 kDa, appears to consist of a globular domain with a diameter of 5 nm and a thin flexible strand of 28 nm (37Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6137-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extended protein structures are often decorated with carbohydrate groups, and it has been suggested that one of their functions is to decrease the flexibility of the polypeptide chain (38Jentoft N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 291-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that most of the carbohydrate groups on H1 and H2 are near the C termini (see Fig.7). In one of the heavy chains (H1) there is a disulfide bridge connecting the C- and N-terminal halves of the molecule (see Fig. 7). The existence of this cross-link indicates that the extended part of the molecule is formed mainly by the polypeptide segment beyond this disulfide, which contains about 150 amino acid residues. If this part of the polypeptide would form an α-helix, it would have a length of about 20 nm. As judged by electron microscopy, the length of the tail is about 15 nm implying that the extended part of the heavy chains contains little tertiary structure. Our observation that proteolytic cleavage in this region of the protein occurs at many closely spaced sites (Figs. 4 A and 5 A) is in agreement with this conclusion. Furthermore, there is a high frequency of the structure-breaking amino acid proline near the C termini of H1 and H2 (39Bourguignon J. Diarra M.M. Thiberville L. Bost F. Sesboue R. Martin J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The fact that the proteinase-sensitive parts of the heavy chains constitute approximately half the polypeptides (see Fig. 7) indicates that there are regions other than the tails that contain flexible structures. However, as judged by electron microscopy (Fig.2 G) and gel filtration, 2A. M. Blom and E. Fries, unpublished observation. the sizes of the globular domains were not affected by partial proteolytic digestion. These findings indicate that the fragments formed from the globular domains were not released. It is possible that the structures of IαI and its isolated heavy chains were altered during the preparation for electron microscopy. The fact that this technique did not reveal any difference in the sizes between H1 and H2, whereas gel filtration showed that that H1 was less extended than H2, suggests that this is the case. Possibly, electron microscopy of unstained, vitrified samples could provide the sizes at more physiological conditions. The experiments with partial proteolytic cleavage described in this paper is an extension of an earlier study in which it was shown that upon treatment of intact IαI with elastase, fragments of H1 and H2 were released by C-terminal cleavages (26Balduyck M. Piva F. Mizon C. Maes P. Malki N. Gressier B. Michalski C. Mizon J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained upon incubation of IαI with tumor cells (40Kobayashi H. Gotoh J. Hirashima Y. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11362-11367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Whether this cleavage process is of physiological significance remains to be seen. It is still unclear how IαI supports the formation of the hyaluronan-containing pericellular coat on various cell types. It has been suggested that the heavy chains bind to the cell surface and then become covalently linked to hyaluronan molecules through their C-terminal ends (41Yoneda M. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5247-5257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If this is the case, it would make sense for the globular domains to be close to the cell surface and the flexible C-terminal parts to extend out of the glycocalyx (38Jentoft N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 291-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). We thank Å. Engström for help with the gel filtration experiments and T. C. Laurent for valuable suggestions."

Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1)1is a component of the platelet α-granule that is released upon platelet degranulation (1Mosher D.F. Annu. Rev. Med. 1990; 41: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is a member of a family of proteins that includes TSP2, TSP3, TSP4, and TSP5 (COMP) (reviewed in Ref. 2Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 62-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). TSP1 and TSP2 are both large trimeric glycoproteins composed of 150-kDa subunits covalently linked by interchain disulfides (3Bornstein P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3290-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). From the amino to the carboxyl terminus, each TSP1 or TSP2 monomer contains a heparin-binding domain, oligomerization (heptad) domain, a procollagen module, three properdin (type I) modules, three epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like (type II) modules, a calcium binding domain, and a globular carboxyl-terminal domain (C-globe) (2Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 62-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). TSP3, TSP4, and TSP5 are pentameric proteins that are composed of subunits that do not contain procollagen or properdin modules (2Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 62-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The disulfide-rich, central stalk region of TSP1, containing the interchain disulfides, the oligomerization domain, the procollagen module, the properdin modules, and the EGF modules, is protease-resistant (4Lawler J. Derick L.H. Connolly J.E. Chen J. Chao F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3762-3772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, assigning function to a discrete module or set of modules within the central stalk of TSP1 has been difficult. Functions have been assigned to the domains of TSP1 using proteolytic fragments, monoclonal antibodies, and synthetic peptides (2Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 62-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Frazier W.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Functions also have been ascribed to recombinant properdin modules expressed as bacterial fusion proteins including activation of latent transforming growth factor β (6Schultz-Cherry S. Lawler J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26783-26788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), attachment of Bowes melanoma cells (7Clezardin P. Lawler J. Amiral J. Quentin G. Delmas P.

No attempts have been made, however, to express the individual modules of the stalk region in their native disulfide-bonded state. The heparin binding domain of TSP1 has been localized to the amino terminus of TSP1 (10Dixit V.M. Grant G.A. Santoro S.A. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10100-10105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

TSP1 becomes bound to fibrin both noncovalently and covalently via activated factor XIII (FXIIIa)-mediated transglutamination during blood coagulation (16Bale M.D. Westrick L.G. Mosher D.F. J. Biol.

FXIII mediates formation of an ε-γ-glutamyl cross-link between specific glutamine and lysine residues. Incorporation of TSP1 into the fibrin clot results in fibrin polymers that are finer and thinner (22Bale M. Semin. Thromb.

The 70-kDa core fragment of TSP1 has the potential to contribute both lysine and glutamine residues to the cross-linking (24Bale M.D. Mosher D.F.

Dubernard V. Bégault B. Lawler J. Blood. 1992; 79: 1995-2003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the fibrin clot has an important role in wound healing, including promoting cell migration, cell adhesion, and endothelial tube formation (20Mosher D.F. Sun X. Sottile J. Hogg P.J. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 6: 115-132Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 29Nehls V. Herrmann R. Microvasc. Res. 1996; 51: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the understanding of proteins incorporated into the clot may provide a better understanding of wound remodeling. In order to explore specific interactions of procollagen and properdin modules of TSP1, we expressed the modules as fusion proteins with the gelatin-binding domain (GBD) of fibronectin in insect cells using baculovirus. The expression system allowed the modules to be processed by the secretory machinery and thus optimizes the chances that the modules will adopt their native fold and disulfides. The proteins were purified from conditioned media by gelatin-agarose affinity chromatography, examined for heparin binding activity, and studied in protein-protein interactions. Five constructs of the procollagen and properdin modules of human TSP1 cDNA were expressed in the GELEX (GE1) expression vector based on the amino-terminal third of fibronectin (30Sottile J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar): the first properdin module (P1); the third properdin module (P3); the first and second properdin modules in series (P12); the first, second, and third properdin modules in series (P123); and the procollagen domain with the first, second, and third properdin modules in series (CP123) (Fig. 1). The amplified cDNA inserts for P1, P12, and P123 all encoded for the amino-terminal sequence beginning at SDSA (positions 357–360), selected based on intron/exon boundaries (31Wolf F.W. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Dixit V.M. Genomics. 1990; 6: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The P3 constructs began at INGG (positions 473–476) based on the same reasoning. The CP123 construct began at LRRP (positions 294–298), a choice based on a cleavage site in TSP1 that gives rise to the anti-angiogenic gp140 fragment of hamster TSP1 generated by baby hamster kidney cells (32Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F. Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal sequences of the constructs were as follows: P1, QECD; P12, DACP; and P123, P3, and CP123, DCPI. TSP1 cDNA, a kind gift from Dr. Vishva Dixit (33Frazier W.A. Dixit V.M. Galvin N.J. Rotwein P.R. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1987; 13: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), was amplified using PCR with appropriate primers to introduce a BstXI restriction site at each end of the PCR-amplified DNA. The PCR products were digested withBstXI and subcloned into GE1/pGEM4 producing module/GE1 constructs (30Sottile J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the cloned constructs was verified against errors introduced by polymerase chain reaction by dideoxy sequencing of double-stranded DNA (Sequenase kit, U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The module/GE1 constructs, P1/GE1, P12/GE1, P123/GE1, and CP123/GE1, were cut from pGEM4 at the 5′-end with Acc65, blunt ended with Klenow fragment, and modified with PstI linkers (Promega, Madison, WI). The constructs were treated withPstI and XbaI. The PstI toXbaI properdin/GE1 sequence was isolated and subcloned into the transfer vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for production of recombinant baculovirus and expression in Sf9 insect cells. P3/GE1 was cut from pGEM4 (Promega) using BamHI and directly subcloned into pVL1392. Cotransfection of recombinant DNA with Baculogold DNA (Invitrogen) was done in Sf9 insect cells under serum-free conditions. Viruses that had undergone homologous recombination were plaque-purified and amplified to pass 2 or pass 3. For production of recombinant protein, Hi5 or Sf9 insect cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection between 5 and 10 in suspension or adherent cultures. Forty-eight to 72 h after infection, culture medium was spun down to remove cells and/or cellular debris, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 2 mm. Protein was bound to gelatin-agarose via the GBD; unbound material was removed by washing with TBS (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl); and recombinant protein was eluted with 3 m guanidine hydrochloride in TBS, dialyzed against TBS, quick-frozen, and stored at −80 or −135 °C. Purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Determination of protein concentration was based upon the following calculated extinction coefficients (mg/ml/cm) (34Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar) and absorbance at 280 nm: CP123/GE1, 2.10; P123/GE1, 2.10; P12/GE1, 2.03; P1/GE1, 1.96; P3/GE1, 1.98; GE1, 1.90; and P123, 2.55. The fusion proteins are designated with the suffix “GE1” in contrast to proteins cleaved from the GBD that contain no suffix. To remove the GBD, protein was bound to gelatin-agarose (Sigma) at 0.25 μg of protein/μl of gelatin-agarose by batch adsorption, poured into a column, equilibrated with digestion buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2), and treated with trypsin (0.2%, w/w) for 30 min with occasional mixing at room temperature. The cleaved protein was washed from the column in TBS and collected into tubes containing soybean trypsin inhibitor bound to Sepharose (Pierce). The soybean trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose was removed by applying the sample to a chromatography column. The protein was found to be 85–90% pure by SDS-PAGE with the primary contaminant being free GBD. For incorporation of amines into the transglutaminase site(s), either fluorescein-cadaverine (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) or monodansylcadaverine (Sigma) was incubated with the recombinant protein and blood coagulation FXIIIa under similar conditions to the cross-linking experiments described below. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and examined for fluorescent bands with an ultraviolet light source (35Astermark J. Sottile J. Mosher D.F. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3690-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To compare trypsin sensitivity between untreated P123 and reduced, denatured, and alkylated P123, P123 was denatured with 3 mguanidine hydrochloride and reduced with 50 mmdithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C. Then the protein was treated with iodoacetic acid (100 mm) for 2.5 h at room temperature and dialyzed overnight against TBS. Samples were treated with 0.6% (w/w) l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min at the indicated temperature. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with rabbit anti-TSP1 antibodies (36Sottile J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6556-6562Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). NaCl was removed by dialysis of fusion proteins into 20 mm Tris with subsequent addition to the indicated NaCl concentration. Alternatively, P123 cleaved from GBD was dialyzed against TBS. Heparin binding was determined by batch adsorption of proteins for 2 h at 4, 22, or 37 °C to heparin-agarose (Sigma). After batch adsorption, the unbound protein was removed, the heparin-agarose was washed three times, and bound protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris containing 300 mm NaCl or sample buffer (3% SDS, 9 m urea). Bound and unbound protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. FXIII cross-linking was performed to examine the interaction in solution of the P123 construct with proteins of interest. Recombinant FXIII (generous gift of Paul Bishop, Zymogenetics, Seattle, WA) was preactivated with thrombin (generous gift of John Fenton II, New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY) for 30 min at 37 °C, and thrombin was inactivated with hirudin (Sigma). The amino-terminal 70-kDa fragment of fibronectin (37Zhang Q. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33284-33292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), fibrinogen (38Mosher D.F. Johnson R.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), histidine-rich glycoprotein (39Asakura S. Hurley R.W. Skorstengaard K. Ohkubo I. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), plasminogen (40Hogg P.J. Stenflo J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and Hi2 DSK cyanogen bromide fragment of fibrinogen (41Hessel B. Thromb. Res. 1975; 7: 75-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were purified as described previously. The proteins (0.2 μm) were incubated in solution with P123 (0.1 μm) at 37 °C in the presence of FXIIIa (1 μg/ml) in the absence of Ca2+in a total volume of 30 μl to allow binding in the absence of cross-linking. After 1 h, CaCl2 (3 mm) was added for 10 min for cross-linking, and the reaction was stopped with sample buffer containing EDTA (6 mm). Alternatively, in the case using fibrinogen, the FXIIIa was inhibited with EDTA, and the complex was treated with thrombin to cleave fibrinopeptide A and fibrinopeptide B from the Aα- and Bβ- chains of fibrinogen, respectively. To analyze complex formation, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted. The recombinant TSP1 modules were probed with anti-human TSP1 (36Sottile J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6556-6562Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The GBD of the fusion proteins and the tails from GE1 that remain on the amino and carboxyl terminus of the inserted protein after cleavage with trypsin (Fig. 1) were probed with rabbit anti-GE1 (expressed without any insert) antibodies. These antibodies were specific for rat fibronectin and did not recognize human fibronectin in immunoblots. The 27-kDa fragment of fibronectin was probed with rabbit anti-27 kDa (37Zhang Q. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33284-33292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An ovalbumin conjugate of a synthetic peptide corresponding to human fibrinopeptide A (FPA, Aα-(1–16)) was used for preparation of antibody FPA 19/7 (IgG1κ). In contrast to a fibrinogen peptide A-specific antibody identified previously (42Procyk R. Kudryk B. Callender S. Blomback B. Blood. 1991; 77: 1469-1475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), antibody FPA 19/7 not only reacts with native and synthetic Aα-(1–16) and synthetic Aα-(7–16) but also with intact fibrinogen (Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, data not shown). In fact, the reactivity of this antibody with fibrinogen is significantly greater than with any of the free peptides (IC50(fibrinogen) = 100 pmol/ml; IC50(Aα-(1–16)/Aα-(7–16)) = 2000 pmol/ml). This antibody does not react with any chain of fibrin or FXIIIa cross-linked fibrin. Three other anti-Aα monoclonal antibodies were used: 1D4 to residues 349–406, 1C2-2 to residues 529–539, and T103 to residues 308–318 of fibrinogen. The epitope for T103 was defined by synthetic peptides similar to what was described previously for the epitopes of ID4 and IC2–2 (43Procyk R. Bishop P.D. Kudryk B. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Negative controls, i.e. cross-linking in the presence or absence of P123, were included in each experiment to be certain there was no antibody cross-reactivity to other proteins. Cross-linking of P123 or the fusion proteins to self was assessed in each experiment and was negative under all conditions used. Chemiluminescence reagents (NEN Life Science Products) were used to detect horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies (Cappel/Organon Teknika Corp., West Chester, PA) bound to the rabbit or mouse primary antibodies. To study the incorporation of the 27-kDa fragment of fibronectin (purified as described (44McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar)) and procollagen and properdin modules of TSP1 into fibrin clots, the various proteins (0.1 μm) were incubated with purified fibrinogen (1.47 μm), recombinant FXIII (3 μg/ml), CaCl2 (3 mm), and thrombin (1 unit/ml) in 10 mm Tris with 150 or 300 mm NaCl in a total volume of 20 or 40 μl. The clots were formed for 60 min as described (45Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6614-6621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysis of fibrin clots was done at 37 °C using 5–10 μg/ml concentration of urokinase-activated plasminogen (40Hogg P.J. Stenflo J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To analyze P123 cross-linking to fibrin in a more complex milieu, platelet poor plasma was prepared, and the globulin proteins were precipitated with 40% saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was resuspended and dialyzed against TBS containing 0.1 mm EDTA. After the addition of P123, the plasma globulin fraction was clotted with thrombin and CaCl2 for 60 min at 37 °C. Purified fibrinogen supplemented with FXIII was used as a control. For plasma clots and the respective control, the clot was separated from the supernatant but not washed. The clot was reduced, denatured, and loaded onto the gel. For fibrin clots, the entire clot and supernatant were denatured and in some cases reduced, with the total volume loaded onto the gel. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot as described above. Alternatively, for 125I-TSP cross-linking experiments, fibrin clots were formed with purified fibrinogen (20 μg/ml) and 125I-TSP (3.8 μg/ml) in 30 μl for 1 h at 37 °C as described previously (16Bale M.D. Westrick L.G. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7502-7508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P123 was tested at several concentrations (10–54 μg/ml). The negative controls, the 70-kDa fragment of fibronectin and GE1, were tested at equimolar concentration of 2.4 μm (equivalent to 54 μg/ml P123). The entire clot and supernatant were reduced and denatured, the total volume was loaded onto the gel, and the proteins were separated on 5% SDS-PAGE, in some cases in the absence of a stacker. Amounts of cross-linked125I-TSP were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). P123/GE1 was iodinated as described previously for the 70-kDa fragment of fibronectin (37Zhang Q. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33284-33292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and binding of 125I-P123/GE1 to fibrinogen (1–3 μg/ml) coated onto plastic (Falcon Probind 96-well plate, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was determined in duplicate as described for collagen V (46Takagi J. Fujisawa T. Usui T. Aoyama T. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15544-15549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the structure/function of the procollagen and properdin modules of TSP1, the modules (Fig.1 A) were expressed in insect cells using the GE1 expression vector that encodes the pre-pro secretion signal, the transglutaminase site(s), the protease-sensitive site, and GBD (Fig. 1 B) (30Sottile J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The modules of the GBD must be in their native conformation to bind to gelatin (47Yamada K.M. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, Inc., New York1989: 47-121Google Scholar). This property allows the GBD to serve as a quality control for proper folding of the fusion proteins during processing in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. After trypsin cleavage, the expressed module(s) retain(s) from the expression vector the transglutaminase cross-linking sites in the amino and carboxyl-terminal tails from the expression vector. The primary transglutaminase acceptor site (Gln4) is amino-terminal to the modules (Fig. 1 B), while a potential, additional site, Gln13, is carboxyl-terminal to the expressed modules (35Astermark J. Sottile J. Mosher D.F. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3690-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Corbett S.A. Lee L. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24999-25005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed at concentrations of 2.5–20 μg/ml, secreted into the culture medium, and purified by gelatin-agarose affinity chromatography (Fig.2 A). CP123/GE1, P123/GE1, and P12/GE1 were approximately 68, 61, and 55 kDa, respectively, as estimated from SDS-PAGE. P1/GE1 and P3/GE1 were similar in size, approximately 48 kDa. The estimated sizes by SDS-PAGE were consistent with the calculated masses. All proteins migrated more rapidly in the absence of reducing agent (data not shown), indicating the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds, and disulfide-linked oligomers were not detected (data not shown). All proteins incorporated monodansylcadaverine or fluorescein-cadaverine when reacted with FXIIIa (data not shown), indicating that the transglutaminase site(s) were functional. There were no apparent differences in amine incorporation among constructs. The protein preparations shown are representative in that all contained GBDs of approximately 41 kDa, presumably due to cleavage between the expressed modules and the GBD fusion proteins during expression or purification. The stalk region of TSP1 is resistant to protease digestion (4Lawler J. Derick L.H. Connolly J.E. Chen J. Chao F.C. J. Biol.

The mitochondrial ATP synthase is the major enzyme responsible for aerobic synthesis of ATP. ATP synthase exhibits a tripartite structure consisting of a head piece (the catalytic sector), a base piece (the membrane sector), and a connecting stalk. However, the enzyme can be resolved into two parts: the first part is the catalytic sector called F1, which is a water-soluble entity, composed of subunits α, β, γ, δ, and ε, which retains the ability to hydrolyze ATP when in a soluble form; the second part is a detergent-soluble entity, called F0, which is embedded in the membrane and is composed of hydrophobic subunits forming a specific proton pathway. The connecting stalk is composed of elements of both F1 and F0. When the two sectors are coupled, the enzyme functions as a reversible H+-transporting ATPase or ATP synthase (1Pedersen P.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,2Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 1319: 19-58Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The model for energy coupling by F1F0 ATP synthase that has gained the most general support is the binding change mechanism (3Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). This concept has been strengthened by the crystal structure of the major part of the bovine F1 (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). The affinity changes for the substrates and products at the catalytic sites are coupled to proton translocation via the rotation of subunits that belong to F1 and F0 (for review, see Refs.5Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4401-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As a result, the Escherichia coli ATP synthase could be a rotary motor with a rotor that is composed of subunits γ and ε and the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding protein oligomer, all other subunits being parts of the stator.The E. coli ATP synthase and the bovine enzyme contain 8 and 16 different types of subunits, respectively (9Collinson I.R. Runswick M.J. Buchanan S.K. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Van Raaij M.J. Griffith D.E. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7971-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the case ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the ATP synthase is composed of at least 13 different kinds of subunits involved in the structure of the enzyme (10Spannagel C. Vaillier J. Chaignepain S. Velours J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); the disruption of each of their structural genes leads to a lack of assembly of the complex. Additional subunits are involved in the regulation of the catalytic sector, such as the natural inhibitory peptide of the mitochondrial ATPase (11Ichikawa N. Yoshida Y. Hashimoto T. Ogasawara N. Yoshikawa H. Imamoto F. Tagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6274-6278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stabilizing factors in yeast (12Akashi A. Yoshida Y. Nakagoshi H. Kuroki K.

Arselin G. Graves P.V. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the two other components, e and g, appear as being not essential for the structure of the mitochondrial enzyme, because their respective gene disruption does not significantly alter yeast growth on nonfermentable carbon sources (17Tokatlidis K. Junne T. Moes S. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Kronidou N. Nature. 1996; 384: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A.

In this paper, we describe a new component of the yeast ATP synthase, the gene disruption of which leads to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation yield.DISCUSSIONWe report here that, as shown previously (18Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), subunit e is associated with the yeast ATP synthase and that, in addition, this subunit is easily removed from the complex by Triton X-100. Therefore, this protein is not essential to the structure of the enzyme. Another component of the ATP synthase, named subunit i, is also described. So far, such an additional protein has not been identified in the beef enzyme. The absence of subunit i in the null mutant does not alter the structure or the assembly of the yeast ATP synthase. We have observed that polyclonal antibodies raised against the α-subunit made it possible to precipitate the wild-type and the null mutant ATP synthase from mitochondrial 0.375% Triton X-100 extracts, and that the obtained immunoprecipitates showed similar patterns of subunits on SDS-PAGE (not shown).Disruption of the ATP18 gene showed that this subunit is not essential for oxidative phosphorylations. However, the efficiency of the phosphorylating system is decreased with inactivation of theATP18 gene, and this probably originates from a reduced turnover of the enzyme. It has been described that mutants in F0 often display pleiotropic effects such as low oxygen consumption and low cytochrome oxidase activity (40Ebner E. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5379-5384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Paul M.F. Velours J. Arselin de Chateaubodeau G. Aigle M. Guérin B. Eur. J.

The experimental data give insight into a mechanistic defect that is expressed during ATP synthase function rather than a deficiency caused by a decrease in the cytochrome oxidase amount. On the basis of all the data presented in this paper, we conclude that the null mutant ATP synthase, devoid of the supernumerary subunit i, shows in vitro a defect in proton translocation through F0during ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis. In vivo, this alteration leads to a slow growth of mutant cells and the production of a low amount of matter on nonfermentable carbon sources. Experiments are in progress to elucidate the involvement of subunit i in the activity of the ATP synthase, especially at the proton translocation level, and to investigate the relationships of subunit i with other known components of the yeast complex. The mitochondrial ATP synthase is the major enzyme responsible for aerobic synthesis of ATP. ATP synthase exhibits a tripartite structure consisting of a head piece (the catalytic sector), a base piece (the membrane sector), and a connecting stalk. However, the enzyme can be resolved into two parts: the first part is the catalytic sector called F1, which is a water-soluble entity, composed of subunits α, β, γ, δ, and ε, which retains the ability to hydrolyze ATP when in a soluble form; the second part is a detergent-soluble entity, called F0, which is embedded in the membrane and is composed of hydrophobic subunits forming a specific proton pathway. The connecting stalk is composed of elements of both F1 and F0. When the two sectors are coupled, the enzyme functions as a reversible H+-transporting ATPase or ATP synthase (1Pedersen P.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,2Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 1319: 19-58Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The model for energy coupling by F1F0 ATP synthase that has gained the most general support is the binding change mechanism (3Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). This concept has been strengthened by the crystal structure of the major part of the bovine F1 (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). The affinity changes for the substrates and products at the catalytic sites are coupled to proton translocation via the rotation of subunits that belong to F1 and F0 (for review, see Refs.5Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4401-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). As a result, the Escherichia coli ATP synthase could be a rotary motor with a rotor that is composed of subunits γ and ε and the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding protein oligomer, all other subunits being parts of the stator. The E. coli ATP synthase and the bovine enzyme contain 8 and 16 different types of subunits, respectively (9Collinson I.R. Runswick M.J. Buchanan S.K. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Van Raaij M.J. Griffith D.E. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7971-7978Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the case ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the ATP synthase is composed of at least 13 different kinds of subunits involved in the structure of the enzyme (10Spannagel C. Vaillier J. Chaignepain S. Velours J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); the disruption of each of their structural genes leads to a lack of assembly of the complex. Additional subunits are involved in the regulation of the catalytic sector, such as the natural inhibitory peptide of the mitochondrial ATPase (11Ichikawa N. Yoshida Y. Hashimoto T. Ogasawara N. Yoshikawa H. Imamoto F. Tagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6274-6278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stabilizing factors in yeast (12Akashi A. Yoshida Y. Nakagoshi H. Kuroki K.

Arselin G. Graves P.V. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1111-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the two other components, e and g, appear as being not essential for the structure of the mitochondrial enzyme, because their respective gene disruption does not significantly alter yeast growth on nonfermentable carbon sources (17Tokatlidis K.

In this paper, we describe a new component of the yeast ATP synthase, the gene disruption of which leads to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation yield.

Nature. 1991; 351: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), suggesting that the secondary structure, rather than the primary sequence and/or the specific length of that domain, plays a key role in G-protein coupling. Recent investigations revealed that a synthetic peptide representing the proximal part of i3 (residues 216–230) is able to activate purified Gi and G0 proteins, while the peptide comprising the distal part of that loop (residues 229–242) has no effect (33Shirai H. Takahashi K. Katada T. Inagami T. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 726-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results have been obtained in a study focused on the activation of Gq, where it has been shown that the peptide encompassing residues 216–231 is active, while the one representing the i3 segment 230–241 does not exhibit any activity (34Sano T. Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Nakagomi Y. Nakazawa S. Kikyo M. Shirai H. Blank J.S. Exton J.H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23631-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the proximal half of i3 has been predicted to have a very high probability to adopt an amphipathic α-helical structure, whereas the distal half is predicted to form a short helix only at its COOH-terminal end (35Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 36Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Compu. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of these evidences, we have studied the solution conformation of two synthetic fragments mapping the entire i3 loop, the NH2-terminal 19-mer TSYTLIWKALKKAYEIQKN-NH 2, Ni3 (residues 213–231), and the C COOH-terminal 16-merEIQKNKPRNDDIFRII-NH 2, Ci3 (residues 227–242). The underlined residues indicate the overlapping region between the two peptides. The structures of the two peptides in 70% H2O/30% TFE were obtained by means of restrained molecular dynamics calculations using, as restraints, the NMR-derived proton distances and φ dihedral angles. The results show that Ni3 is characterized by a well defined amphipathic α-helix extending over almost the entire peptide sequence. For Ci3, the data indicate the existence of cis-transisomerization about the Lys6—Pro7 peptide bond giving rise to two slowly exchanging conformational states. The resulting isomers adopt very similar secondary structures characterized by a poorly defined NH2 terminus and by a flexible amphipathic α-helix in the COOH-terminal stretch (Asn9-Ile15). Interestingly, the sequence EIQKN common to Ni3 and Ci3, and corresponding to the central part of i3, adopts a quite distinct structural organization in the two peptides suggesting, for Pro233, a functional role as structure breaker or modulator (37Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar, 38Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The results of this work, together with our previous study (17Franzoni L. Nicastro G. Pertinhez T.A. Tatò M. Nakaie C.R. Paiva A.C.M. Schreier S. Spisni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9734-9741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), provide the basis for disclosing some conformational features of the native receptor cytosolic face. In particular, the data support the hypothesis that the capability of specific domains of the receptor to form amphipathic α-helices is essential for receptor activation and G-protein selection and coupling. The two peptides corresponding to residues 213–231 (Ni3) and 227–242 (Ci3) of the i3 loop of the rat angiotensin II AT1A receptor (Fig. 1) have been synthesized by the solid phase method usingt-butoxycarbonyl chemistry.

The peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and their purity and molecular weight were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Fig. 5 shows the sequences with both the numbering for the residues of the peptides and the one from the primary sequence of rat AT1A receptor (32Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Runge M.S.

Ellipticity is reported as the mean residue molar ellipticity, [θ] (deg cm2dmol−1). The instrument has been calibrated with recrystallized d-10-camphorsulfonic acid. The H2O/TFE cross-titration experiments were carried out mixing the appropriate aliquots of two 0.15 mm stock solutions, one in water at pH ≈ 4 and the other in TFE. A 1 mm cell was used. NMR samples were prepared in 70% H2O/30% TFE-d 3 (v/v), pH ≈ 4, to yield a peptide concentration of about 2 mm for both peptides. All two-dimensional 1H-NMR experiments were recorded and processed by the procedures elsewhere described (17Franzoni L. Nicastro G. Pertinhez T.A. Tatò M. Nakaie C.R. Paiva A.C.M. Schreier S.

The structures of the two peptides were computed using the final set of NOE-derived distance constraints listed in Table III together with the φ dihedral angles. The quality of the final structures was verified on the basis of the minimum number of NOE distance and φ dihedral angle violations as well as of the minimum root mean square deviation values of the backbone atoms in the region of interest. For NOE distance and φ dihedral angle violations, an upper limit of 0.3 Å and 5 degrees has been used, respectively.Table II1H-NMR chemical shifts and 3JHN-α coupling constants for Ni3, (2.0 mm) in 70% H2O/30% TFE-d3 (v/v), pH ≈ 4, at 25 °CResidue3 J HN-αNHαHβHγHOthersHzppmThr13.884.081.24Ser28.664.603.95, 3.88Tyr36.28.304.422.97, 2.86δH 7.06; εH 6.82Thr45.67.784.054.211.29Leu56.27.674.221.80, 1.681.74δH 1.01, 0.94Ile66.57.503.861.94γH2 1.60, 1.22γH3 0.89; δH 0.86Trp75.68.064.433.36, 3.341NH 9.81; 2H 7.17; 4H 7.59; 5H 7.10; 6H 7.20; 7H 7.44Lys85.97.963.902.00, 1.931.44δH 1.73; εH 3.01Ala95.97.994.151.57Leu106.08.504.121.891.52δH0.86Lys115.78.154.001.82, 1.741.35δH 1.63; εH 2.95Lys126.27.854.162.04, 1.961.56δH 1.78; εH 2.99Ala135.68.194.101.54Tyr145.98.404.233.21δH7.15; εH 6.83Glu155.98.173.952.32, 2.212.64, 2.50Ile166.58.263.852.01γH2 1.60, 1.23γH3 0.95; δH 0.88Gln176.38.064.112.162.54, 2.38δNH2 7.30, 7.07Lys185.98.174.101.72, 1.691.33δH 1.62; εH 2.98Asn197.67.904.692.90, 2.81γNH2 7.61, 6.86term-NH2 7.16, 6.61 Open table in a new tab Table I1H-NMR chemical shifts and 3JHN-α coupling constants for the trans- and the cis-Pro-containing isomers of Ci3, (2.6 mm) in 70% H2O/30% TFE-d3 (v/v), pH ≈ 4 at 25 °CResidue3 J HN-αNHαHβHγHOthersHzppmGlu14.152.172.45Ile27.28.684.241.89γH2 1.55, 1.25γH3 0.98; δH 0.95Gln36.48.514.412.14, 2.042.43δNH2 7.56, 6.82Lys47.28.384.341.88, 1.781.50, 1.46δH 1.75; εH 3.04Asn56.48.364.602.80γNH27.58, 6.88Lys67.28.134.651.88, 1.781.51δH 1.76; εH 3.067.3aNumbers in italics, trans andcis-Pro-containing isomers.8.174.641.88, 1.791.51δH 1.76; εH 3.06Pro74.472.34, 1.962.07, 2.04δH 3.85, 3.684.462.35, 1.962.07, 2.04δH 3.85, 3.69Arg87.18.414.411.97, 1.831.75, 1.70δH 3.27; εNH 7.586.48.214.311.96, 1.851.76, 1.69δH 3.24; εNH 7.59Asn96.78.464.682.84γNH27.54, 6.825.58.294.642.79γNH27.53, 6.82Asp106.78.444.652.807.78.364.752.79Asp117.28.174.622.805.48.354.612.78Ile124.67.843.961.82γH2 1.33, 1.16γH3 0.82; δH 0.694.27.863.971.85γH2 1.34, 1.16γH3 0.83; δH 0.72Phe135.97.744.433.26, 3.10δH 7.32; εH 7.375.5ζH7.317.824.433.25, 3.11δH 7.33; δH 7.37ζH 7.31Arg146.57.754.221.951.76, 1.68δH 3.27; εNH 7.375.67.784.231.931.72, 1.68δH 3.26; εNH 7.37Ile157.07.734.061.97γH2 1.62, 1.22γH3 0.93; δH 0.87Ile166.07.814.121.95γH2 1.53, 1.26γH3 0.96; δH 0.84term-NH2 7.25, 6.91a Numbers in italics, trans andcis-Pro-containing isomers.

Open table in a new tab The CD spectra of both peptides did not indicate the existence of any preferential secondary structure in aqueous solution (Fig. 2), and they were not affected by changes in concentration within the 0.15–1.5 mm range. 2Pertinhez, T. A., et al., manuscript in preparation.However, upon addition of small aliquots of TFE, it was found that Ni3 exhibited a transition to an α-helical conformation the extension of which increased up to 30% TFE (Fig. 2 A), where it stabilized at an helical content of ∼55%, as calculated according to the method of Chen et al. (40Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). For Ci3, instead, only a partial folding into an ill defined helical structure could be observed at high TFE concentration (Fig. 2 B). In this case, however, due to the complexity of the spectrum suggesting the existence of a multiple conformation equilibrium, the use of the same method to evaluate the peptide α-helical content (Fig. 2 B) appears not to be ideal. A detailed analysis of the CD data will be the subject of a work in preparation.2 According to the CD results, all 1H-NMR experiments were recorded in 70% H2O/30% TFE-d 3 (v/v). The complete assignment of the proton resonances for the two peptides was obtained using standard two-dimensional methods (41Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The spectra of Ci3 displayed two distinct sets of resonances for the stretch Lys6–Arg14 (TableI), suggesting the existence of acis-trans isomerization about the Lys6—Pro7 peptide bond. The correct assignments of the protons corresponding to the two conformers was based on the observation, in the NOESY and rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectra, of the characteristic connectivities between Lys6αH and Pro7αH for the cisisomers and between Lys6αH and Pro7δH for the trans isomers. The relative intensity of the peaks indicates that the cis-trans molar ratio turns out to be ∼1:1.5, suggesting that the two isomers are energetically quite similar. The chemical shifts for Ci3 and Ni3 are listed in Tables I and II, respectively. The proton resonances of the common sequence EIQKN present significant differences in the two peptides, indicating that the amino acids flanking that domain play an important role in defining its secondary structure. The conformational features of the two peptides have been derived by the analysis of complementary NMR parameters such as the α-proton chemical shift perturbation, the3 J HN-α coupling constants and the NOEs pattern. The α-proton residual chemical shifts (42Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar) are reported in Fig.3. In the case of Ni3 (Fig.3 A), it is evident that, except for Ser2 and Leu5, all the α-proton resonances move upfield with respect to the random coil values, thus suggesting the existence of a helical structure extending from Ile6 to Asn19. The presence of sequential d NN (i,i + 1) NOEs, spanning almost the entire Ni3 sequence in the 150-ms NOESY spectrum (Fig.4 A), indeed supports the existence of an α-helical conformation whose stability is confirmed by the characteristic d αN (i,i + 3) connectivities encompassing residues Tyr3–Asn19 (Fig. 4 B). The summary of the interresidue NOEs is reported in Fig.5 A, showing a good correlation with the αCH secondary shifts (Fig. 3 A). Finally, except for Asn19, the majority of the NH-αCH coupling constants (3 J HN-α) are in the range of 5.60–6.5 Hz (Table II), as expected for a peptide in α-helical conformation. On the other hand, knowing that a minimum of 4 adjacent residues with a negative deviation of the αCH chemical shifts is necessary to assess the presence of a stable helical organization, and that its stability is proportional to the intensity of such deviation (42Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar), the secondary shifts plot for Ci3 (Fig. 3B) indicates that, in this case, a helical folding is possible only in the peptide COOH-terminal portion. In addition, except for Arg8 and Asp10, all the residues do not exhibit any significant difference between thetrans and the cis isomers (Fig. 3B) suggesting that Ci3, in the two states, adopt very similar conformations. Indeed, the analysis of the NOESY and rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectra carried out for both the trans andcis isomers evidenced nearly no difference. Thus, Fig. 5B shows the summary of the interresidue NOEs only for the relatively more populated trans isomers. As for Ni3, a good correlation with the αCH secondary shifts (Fig. 3B) can be observed. In fact, adjacent NH-NH correlations, together with medium and weak intensitiesd αN (i, i+3) andd αβ (i, i+3) NOEs were found from Asp10 to Ile16, indicating the presence of a helical conformation only in the COOH-terminal portion of the peptide. Moreover, the coexistence of medium and weak intensity (i, i+3) NOEs together with the intense d αN(i, i+1) correlations, suggests the presence of conformational fluctuations in that stretch. The N-terminal half of Ci3, including the first five amino acids that belong to a well defined α-helix in the COOH-terminal half of Ni3, clearly does not adopt any stable secondary structure. Except for the Asn5 NH-Lys6 NH connectivity, the other medium range NOEs associated to the presence of helical regions are unambiguously absent from the spectra. Finally, in the Pro-containing stretch, NOE connectivities reminiscent of the presence of a β-turn were not found. Following the restrained molecular dynamics protocol described under “Materials and Methods,” 80 possible three-dimensional structures were calculated for both peptides. After minimization, 20 structures for each peptide were selected to represent their solution conformation. The structural statistics are reported in Table III. Fig. 6 A displays the Ni3 structures superimposed, for the minimum backbone deviation, between residues Tyr3 and Lys18. The existence of a stable and well defined α-helical folding, involving most of the peptide, is also supported by the analysis of the main chain hydrogen bonds (Table III) and of the φ and ψ dihedral angles (data not shown), carried out using the program DSSP (43Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar). In the case of Ci3, Fig. 6 B refers to thetrans-Pro conformers, and the superimposition of the backbone atoms has been made for the Asn9–Ile15 stretch. As previously mentioned, discussing the NMR data, the structures of the cis andtrans isomers are quite similar, with an α-helical conformation extending over the COOH-terminal peptide stretch, only. Because of the limited number of NMR constraints available, the NH2-terminal region preceding Asn9 is poorly defined and no elements of stable ordered secondary structure have been detected. Fig. 6 (bottom) shows a schematic representation of the least energy structure for the two peptides evidencing the amphipathic nature of the α-helical regions. There is a general consensus (6Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar,44Wess J.

Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) on the hypothesis that the specific conformational changes of GPCRs cytosolic domains, induced by agonist binding, are critical for their activation. Since experimental observations with substitution or deletion in receptor mutants cannot rule out the induction of indirect conformational effects, the use of synthetic peptides representing defined receptor regions allows the performance of experiments in a more conformationally controlled manner. The validity of this approach is based on the recognition that if the isolated fragments retain the biological function they have in the receptor (e.g.G-protein activation), it is likely that their folding and conformational dynamics are similar to the ones they undergo in the native receptor (33Shirai H. Takahashi K. Katada T. Inagami T. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 726-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar).

Previous studies have shown that several DNA repair proteins also play a role in RNAP II-mediated transcription. For example, the general transcription factor TFIIH provides a direct link between nucleotide excision repair and transcription mediated by RNA polymerase II. TFIIH is a multifunctional, multiprotein complex whose subunits play critical roles in repair, transcription, and progression through the cell cycle (14Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W.

Reinberg D. Nature. 1996; 381: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and with isolated preinitiation complexes (18Peterson S.R. Dvir A. Anderson C.W. Dynan W.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 426-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Certain transcription factors, including heat shock factor 1, have been shown to stimulate the activity of DNA-PK in an in vitroreaction (19Peterson S.R. Jesch S.A. Chamberlin T.N. Dvir A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26009-26016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Also, DNA-PK is known to phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNAP II in vitro (18Peterson S.R. Dvir A. Anderson C.W. Dynan W.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 426-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Progression through the transcription cycle is coupled to changes in phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNAP II (reviewed in Ref. 21Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar), although the specific role of DNA-PK in this process has not been established. To investigate directly the involvement of DNA-PKcs and/or Ku protein in RNAP II-mediated transcription, we have measured in vitrotranscription levels in nuclear extracts prepared from DNA-PK-deficient CHO cell lines. We found that cells deficient in either DNA-PKcs (V30T) or Ku80 (xrs-6cvec) consistently show a 2–7-fold decrease in transcription with a number of promoters. Surprisingly, in vitro transcription levels cannot be restored to the deficient nuclear extracts by supplementing with purified catalytic subunit or Ku protein. Rather, restoration of activity requires a positively acting factor or complex derived from a DNA-PK-containing cell line. In addition, we found that the decreased levels of transcription in DNA-PK-deficient cells lie in a decreased ability to carry out secondary initiation subsequent to the initial round of transcriptional initiation. Supercoiled plasmids were used as templates in all experiments. The AdMLP template consisted of the adenovirus major late core promoter upstream of a 380-base pair G-less cassette. The hsp70 template consisted of two idealized heat shock elements joined to the hsp70 core promoter, upstream of a 190-base pair G-less cassette (22Becker P.B. Rabindran S.K. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4109-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The HTLV-I template consisted of four Tax-responsive elements joined to the HTLV-I core promoter, upstream of a 380-base pair G-less cassette. CHO cells were grown as confluent monolayers in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 150 mg/liter l-glutamine in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Cells were harvested from 50, 150 × 25-mm culture dishes by scraping into phosphate-buffered saline-containing 5 mm MgCl2. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline/MgCl2 and resuspended in 4 packed cell volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 1 mm DTT, 60 μm PMSF). Subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were incubated 20 min on ice with swirling and then lysed by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed in 2 packed cell volumes of lysis buffer. The washed pellet was resuspended in 4 packed cell volumes of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 0.42 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 10% sucrose, 2 mm DTT, 60 μmPMSF), stirred for 30 min, and then centrifuged for 30 min at 17,000 × g. (NH4)2SO4 (0.33 g/ml) was then added to the supernatant. The mixture was stirred for 30 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 original packed cell volumes of TM 0.1 m(50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 0.1 m KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 60 μm PMSF), dialyzed twice against TM 0.1 m buffer, and centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was collected and protein concentration determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. HeLa and LTRα3 cells were grown in suspension in S-minimum Eagle's medium (Joklik-modified) supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, 5% newborn calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acid supplement, and 100 mm sodium pyruvate in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and nuclear extract prepared as described. 500 ng of DNA template was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 30–50 μg of the appropriate nuclear extract in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 0.05 m KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, and 20 units of RNasin in a final volume of 46.5 μl. 3.5 μl of nucleotides was then added to final concentrations of 250 μm ATP, 250 μm CTP, 12.5 μm CTP, 12.5 μm3′-O-methyl-GTP and 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP and the mixture incubated for another 45 min at 30 °C. In some reactions, 10 μg/ml heparin was added 2–5 min after the initiation of transcription to prevent further initiation events (23Conaway J.W. Bradsher J.N. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10142-10148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, endogenous GTP permitted extension of transcripts beyond the G-less cassette. To digest these to a uniform size, 40 units of ribonuclease T1 was added, and the reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. All reactions were stopped by the addition of 150 μl of 0.2 m NaCl, 200 μg/ml tRNA, 0.02 m EDTA, and 1% SDS and 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m NaCl. The reactions were extracted with 300 μl of a 1:1 (v:v) mixture of phenol and 96% chloroform, 4% isoamyl alcohol, and the RNA was precipitated by the addition of 750 μl of cold ethanol-containing 0.5 mNH4OAc. The resulting pellets were washed with 500 μl of 70% cold ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 20 μl of 7 murea dye. Samples were loaded onto a prerun 5% urea polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 700 V for 45 min. Incorporated radiolabel was visualized and quantitated by PhosphorImage analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Recombinant Ku protein was purified as described previously (20Huang J. Nueda A. Yoo S. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26009-26016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Native DNA-PKcs was purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts as described previously, except that the phenyl-Superose and Mono S steps were omitted (24Dvir A. Stein L.Y. Calore B.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10440-10447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α/β and γ subunits of TFIIA were purified individually using Ni+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography (25Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). TFIIA was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column to isolate assembled complexes from free subunits. Recombinant TFIIB (26Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Nature. 1991; 352: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and recombinant TFIIF 30- and 74-kDa subunits (27Aso T. Vasavada H.A. Kawaguchi T. Germino F.J. Ganguly S. Kitajima S. Weissman S.M. Yasukochi Y. Nature. 1992; 355: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were purified individually by phosphocellulose and gel filtration chromatography. Recombinant TFIIE 34- and 56-kDa subunits were purified as described (28Peterson M.G. Inostroza J. Maxon M.E. Flores O. Admon A. Reinberg D. Tjian R. Nature. 1991; 354: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). RNAP II (29Lu H. Flores O. Weinmann R. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10004-10008Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) was purified from a HeLa cell nuclear pellet by DE52, heparin-agarose, and DEAE hydrocell 1000 (Rainin) chromatography. TFIIH was purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts by phosphocellulose and DE52 chromatography, followed by GST-VP16 affinity chromatography as described previously (30Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). TFIIH was also purified from HeLa nuclear extracts using phosphocellulose, DE52, Superdex 200 (in 0.1m KCl buffer), DEAE hydrocell, phenyl-Superose, and Superdex 200 (in 0.3 m KCl buffer) chromatography. For both purification schemes, TFIIH fractions were identified by Western blots using anti-TFIIH p62 antibody (Santa Cruz) and anti-TFIIH p40 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Native TFIID was purified as described previously (31Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 557-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The peak from the Mono S column was further purified on a PureGel strong cation exchange resin. Highly purified preparations of epitope-tagged affinity purified TFIID (eIID) were obtained from a HeLa cell line expressing an influenza hemagglutinin peptide-TBP fusion protein. The eIID was purified as described previously (32Zhou Q. Lieberman P.M. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) except that the 1.0 m KCl phosphocellulose fractions containing the eIID complexes were passed over a column (1 ml of beads per 60 liters of starting volume of cell culture) of anti-epitope antibody coupled to protein A. After washing, eIID was eluted with 3 ml of 1 mg/ml influenza epitope peptide. Fractions containing eIID were identified by Western blots probed with anti-TBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Individual factors were assayed for activity by comparing levels of in vitrotranscription in their absence to levels seen in reactions containing the complete complement of general transcription factors. The kinase activity of DNA-PK was determined using the SignaTECT DNA-dependent Protein Kinase Assay System from Promega. In brief, 300 ng of a purified mixture containing both Ku and DNA-PKcs was incubated with activator DNA, a biotinylated p53-derived peptide substrate, and [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of the DNA-PK inhibitor, wortmannin. The biotinylated substrate was then isolated using a streptavidin-cellulose filter. Incorporation of phosphate into the peptide was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. To investigate the possible involvement of DNA-PKcs, Ku protein, or both in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription, we measured in vitrotranscription levels in nuclear extracts prepared from matched pairs of DNA-PK-containing and DNA-PK-deficient CHO cell lines. The V30T cell line is radiation-sensitive and DNA-PKcs-deficient, and AA8 is a matched wild-type, parental CHO cell line (5Peterson S.R. Kurimasa A. Oshimura M. Dynan W.S. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2934-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Collins A.R. Mutat. Res. 1993; 293: 99-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The xrs-6cvec cell line is radiation-sensitive and -deficient in the 80-kDa subunit of Ku protein, and xrs-6cKu80 is a matched cell line rescued with the cDNA encoding the human Ku80 protein (34Chen F. Peterson S.R. Story M.D. Chen D.J. Mutat. Res. 1996; 362: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We performed transcription assays using extracts from these cell lines and a supercoiled DNA template containing either the AdMLP, hsp70, or HTLV-I promoter incorporated upstream of a G-less cassette. Nuclear extracts were prepared and stored under identical conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” Equal amounts of total nuclear extract protein were added to each transcription reaction. Representative transcription assays are shown in Fig.1. In each case, the extracts from DNA-PK-deficient cells (xrs-6cvec and V30T) showed less transcription than the matched, wild-type counterparts (xrs-6cKu80 and AA8). Results from this and four similar, independent experiments are summarized in Table I. These data show a clear defect in the transcriptional activity of DNA-PK-deficient nuclear extracts, ranging from 2.4- to 7.7-fold, when compared with their matched controls. The defect appears to be general, in that it is observed with all promoters tested.Table IFold difference in in vitro transcription levels in extracts of DNA-PK positive and negative cellsExtractTemplateAdMLPhsp70HTLV Ixrs-6cKu80 vs.xrs-6cvec5.5 ± 2.97.7 ± 2.24.3 ± 1.6AA8vs. V30T2.4 ± 2.34.3 ± 1.12.9 ± 2.2Values are means ± S.D. n = 5 in all cases. Open table in a new tab Values are means ± S.D. n = 5 in all cases. Overall levels of transcription were generally higher with the hsp70 promoter than with the others, and this promoter also showed the greatest fold difference between the paired nuclear extracts. Similar results were obtained with a template containing only the hsp70 core promoter and lacking the heat shock elements (data not shown). To determine if thein vitro transcriptional activity of the DNA-PK-deficient nuclear extracts could be rescued, a series of mixing experiments was performed. In these experiments, 7.5, 15, 22.5, or 30 μg of a test nuclear extract was mixed with 30 μg of the deficient nuclear extract, and in vitro transcription assays were carried out using the AdMLP template as described under “Materials and Methods.” Transcription levels of the mixed nuclear extracts were compared with the appropriate DNA-PK-positive control. Results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen in A and D, addition of xrs-6cKu80 nuclear extract resulted in the complete rescue of in vitrotranscription levels of both xrs-6cvec and V30T nuclear extracts. The decrease in transcription levels observed in reactions containing greater than 45 μg of total nuclear extract protein may be due to an excess of protein. Similarly, addition of AA8 nuclear extract resulted in the complete rescue of transcription levels in the DNA-PKcs-deficient V30T nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 B). However, AA8 gave less than maximal restoration in the Ku80-deficient xrs-6cvec extracts (Fig. 2 C). The xrs-6cKu80 cells express a humanKu80 gene under control of the strong cytomegalovirus promoter. It may be that expression of this gene at higher than endogenous levels makes the extracts even more active than would otherwise be the case. We have also seen that V30T extracts failed to rescue xrs-6cvec nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 E), despite the fact that these cells represent different genetic complementation groups (XRCC5versus XRCC7) (35Jeggo P.A. Taccioli G.E. Jackson S.P. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). There was greater, but still incomplete, rescue when the experiment was performed in the opposite direction, with xrs-6cvec extracts added to V30T. These results suggest that both mutant cell lines lack a common factor, not DNA-PK itself, the absence of which results in decreased levels of in vitrotranscription. This was confirmed by the experiments described in the next section. Initially, we attempted to restore transcription levels to the DNA-PK-deficient nuclear extracts by the addition of purified recombinant Ku and DNA-PKcs purified from HeLa cells. However, we observed no increase in transcription levels in the presence of these purified proteins (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained when proteins were added individually over a wide range of concentrations (data not shown). It is possible that the human Ku70 subunit or DNA-PKcs subunit is not capable of functioning in the hamster cell lines, explaining the lack of complementation between species. However, the amino acid sequences of DNA-PK components are relatively conserved between species (reviewed in Ref. 36Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Also, previous studies have shown that cross-species complementation occurs between human and yeast Ku70 (37Barnes G. Rio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and between human and mouse DNA-PKcs (38Kurimasa A. Nagata Y. Shimizu M. Emi M. Nakamura Y. Oshimura M. Hum. Genet. 1994; 93: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that human DNA-PK components can function in hamster cells. Assuming that human DNA-PK can, in principle, function in hamster cells, then the failure to rescue transcription by the addition of purified DNA-PK suggests that the defect may not be directly attributable to the absence of Ku or DNA-PKcs from the extract but rather to the absence of some other common factor. This could be an individual protein that lies downstream of DNA-PK in a signaling pathway or a complex of proteins that fails to assemble in the absence of Ku and DNA-PKcs. When this positively acting factor or complex is supplied to the DNA-PK-deficient cell lines, there is a complete restoration of in vitro transcription levels. Since DNA-PK has intrinsic protein kinase activity, it was of interest to know whether ongoing phosphorylation activity of endogenous DNA-PK contributed to the higher level of transcription seen with extracts from DNA-PK-containing cells. The catalytic subunit of DNA-PK falls into the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family, and its activity has been shown to be effectively inhibited by approximately 250 nm of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (39Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). If the enzymatic activity of DNA-PK is responsible for the higher levels of in vitro transcription observed in the DNA-PK-containing nuclear extracts, one would expect that the difference in transcription levels between xrs-6cKu80 and xrs-6cvec nuclear extracts would be eliminated in the presence of wortmannin. Transcription reactions were performed in the presence of various concentrations of wortmannin, with results shown in Fig.4. The approximately 2-fold difference in transcription levels between the paired nuclear extracts was maintained throughout a range of 0 to 1000 nm wortmannin. In control experiments, we show that the enzymatic activity of purified DNA-PK is almost completely abolished at a concentration of 500 nmwortmannin (Fig. 4 C). We conclude from these experiments that ongoing DNA-PK enzymatic activity is not required for transcription. Consistent with this, we have compared linear and circular templates under the conditions of our assays, and we find that the difference between extracts from DNA-PK-positive and -negative cells is maintained in both cases (data not shown). It is established that linear DNAs are much more effective than circular DNAs in stimulating DNA-PK phosphorylation activity (40Carter T. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar,41Morozov V.E. Falzon M. Anderson C.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16684-16688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that both types of templates give equivalent results is one more line of evidence that ongoing enzymatic activity of DNA-PK does not contribute to the difference between extracts. Because the transcriptional defect of the DNA-PK-deficient cell lines occurred at all promoters tested, one possibility was that the missing component was a general transcription factor. We attempted to rescue transcription by the addition of purified transcription factors to our in vitro transcription assays. Recombinant TFIIA, recombinant TFIIB, recombinant TBP, epitope-tagged TFIID, recombinant TFIIE, recombinant TFIIF, RNAP II, and TFIIH were purified and assayed for activity as described under “Materials and Methods.” No single factor, when added in the amounts indicated (Fig. 5 A), was capable of restoring transcription levels in xrs-6cvec nuclear extract to the levels seen in the xrs-6cKu80 control. Transcription was also not restored by addition of a combination of purified transcription factors (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the observed decrease in transcription levels of DNA-PK-deficient nuclear extracts cannot be attributed to limiting amounts of a general transcription factor. Most of the transcription factors used in this experiment were from recombinant sources and may lack post-translational modifications. Therefore, we cannot at present rule out the possibility that DNA-PK induces some post-translational modification in vivo(e.g. phosphorylation) that is responsible for the higher levels of transcriptional activity seen in the DNA-PK-containing cell lines. The RNAs that are synthesized in vitro can be divided into two categories: those that result from “primary” initiation events that occur immediately upon addition of ribonucleoside triphosphates and those that result from “secondary” initiation events that occur later in the course of the reaction. These secondary events are sometimes referred to as reinitiation events because they may reflect reuse of templates or RNAP II. However, secondary initiation events can also occur for other reasons, for example, if there is template or RNAP II that is sequestered in nonproductive complexes at the time of ribonucleoside triphosphate addition. Experimentally, primary and secondary initiation events can be distinguished by the addition of the sulfated polysaccharide heparin immediately following the initiation of transcription. Heparin, in low concentrations, has been shown to prevent the formation of new initiation complexes without disrupting transcriptionally active complexes already present on the template (23Conaway J.W. Bradsher J.N. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10142-10148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine whether the xrs-6cvec nuclear extracts are defective in primary or secondary transcriptional initiation, the transcription assay illustrated in Fig. 6was performed. Both the rate of PIC formation and the number of productive PICs formed were measured by varying the length of time that the nuclear extract was incubated with template prior to the addition of ribonucleoside triphosphates. The ability of the extracts to undergo secondary initiation events was monitored by comparing the level of RNA synthesis in the presence and absence of heparin. These experiments produced a clear but unanticipated result. When transcription was limited to primary initiation events by the addition of heparin, little or no difference was observed in the ability of either nuclear extract to initiate transcription (Fig. 6; compare intensity of bands at 30 min preincubation in presence of heparin). The rate of preinitiation complex formation and the number of productive complexes formed were similar in both extracts. In fact, preinitiation complex formation was actually higher in the xrs-6cvec extracts when compared with xrs-6cKu80 extracts. In contrast, the two extracts differed considerably in levels of transcription in the absence of heparin. This difference could be solely attributed to the approximately 4-fold greater ability of the xrs-6cKu80 extracts to carry out secondary initiation. In order to better understand the mechanistic differences between primary and secondary initiation events in the xrs-6cvec versus the xrs-6cKu80 nuclear extracts, we have taken advantage of a technique first described by Szentirmay and Sawadogo (42Szentirmay M.N. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and later refined by Lei et al. (43Lei L. Ren D. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2130-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that involves “trapping” of the RNA polymerase II at the end of a G-less cassette by the addition of high concentrations of the chain terminator 3′-O-methyl GTP (O-Me-G). As can be seen in lanes 3 and8 of Fig. 7 A, addition of O-Me-G to a final concentration of 500 μm is sufficient to compete with endogenous GTP present in the nuclear extracts, preventing elongation beyond the G-less cassette, and resulting in the formation of stalled RNAP II complexes. The majority of these complexes can be chased to yield long RNAs by the addition of GTP (Fig. 7 B). This approach allows one to identify whether multiple rounds of transcription are limited by the number of active templates, by the concentration of active RNAP II, or by some other kinetic phenomenon. If reinitiation of transcription is occurring via the reuse of templates, the presence of stalled RNAP II forces subsequent RNAP II molecules to pile up at the end of the G-less cassette resulting in a ladder of shortened transcripts at intervals of approximately 30 nucleotides. We do not observe such a ladder in the presence ofO-Me-G in either the xrs-6cvec (lane 3) or xrs-6cKu80 (lane 8) nuclear extracts. Therefore, few, if any, templates are being reused in our assays. Consequently the differences in observed transcription levels cannot be directly attributed to differences in the ability of the two nuclear extracts to recycle template. Likewise, if the recycling of RNAP II and/or tightly associated transcription factors is required for later rounds of transcription, trapping of RNAP II at the end of the G-less cassette should inhibit new initiation. Although there is some inhibition of transcription withO-Me-GTP (compare lanes 2 and 3 andlanes 7 and 8), it does not ablate the difference between xrs-6cKu80 and xrs-6cvec nuclear extracts (lanes 3and 8) nor does it reduce transcription to the level seen in the presence of heparin (lanes 5 and 10). This suggests that whereas RNAP II and/or some tightly associated factor is partially limiting in the reaction, this limitation is not responsible for the difference of in vitro transcription levels between these two nuclear extracts. This result is consistent with our earlier findings that addition of purified RNAP II does not rescue transcription in the Ku-negative nuclear extract. Thus the difference between extracts falls into the category that Lei et al.(43Lei L. Ren D. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2130-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) described as “kinetic limitation.” The Ku80 nuclear extracts must contain an activity that promotes multiple rounds of transcription but this activity is not RNAP II itself. We present the first definitive evidence that nuclear extracts prepared from cells that are deficient in DNA-PK, a protein primarily known for its essential role in repair of DNA double-strand breaks, are also impaired in their ability to carry out basal transcriptionin vitro. The effect was seen with extracts of both Ku80-deficient and DNA-PKcs-deficient cells. The relative decrease in transcription levels was always greater for the Ku80-negative nuclear extracts than for the DNA-PKcs-negative extracts. This suggests that Ku protein may have a greater or perhaps more direct role than DNA-PKcs in transcriptional regulation. Mixing experiments show that the impaired transcription is due to the lack of a positively acting factor or complex of factors in the deficient extracts. We have yet to identify this positively acting factor. Our inability to restore transcription by the addition of purified DNA-PK suggests that the role of DNA-PK in RNAP II-mediated transcription may be either less direct or more complex than we had initially anticipated. Interestingly, it has been reported that nuclear extracts from DNA-PK-deficient cells also show a modest (2-fold) decrease in nucleotide excision repair activity. As with the transcription defect, the excision repair defect could not be restored by purified DNA-PK protein components (44Muller C. Calsou P. Frit P. Cayrol C. Carter T. Salles B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1382-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It remains to be established whether the transcription and nucleotide excision repair defects have any common mechanistic basis. We have shown that the Ku-negative nuclear extracts are not defective in their ability to carry out single round transcription. Rather, the observed difference in in vitro transcription levels between Ku80-positive and Ku80-negative nuclear extracts can be attributed solely to the ability of the Ku80-containing nuclear extracts to undergo multiple rounds of transcription. The role of secondary initiation, or reinitiation, in the overall levels of RNA synthesis has been overshadowed by the tremendous effort required to obtain our basic understanding of how primary initiation takes place. However, there is every reason to expect that the process of reinitiation is also a highly regulated step. Recently Oelgeschlageret al. (45Oelgeschlager T. Tao Y. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have shown that in HeLa cell nuclear extracts, TAF(II)s (general transcription co-factors that associate with the TATA-binding protein of TFIID and play a central role in RNAP II transcriptional regulation) (reviewed in Ref. 46Verrijzer C.P.

Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) actually impair functional PIC assembly but elevate absolute levels of transcription by facilitating secondary initiation events. Activators of transcription such as heat shock factor and the estrogen receptor have also been shown to selectively enhance reinitiation (45Oelgeschlager T. Tao Y. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 925-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 46Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Reinitiation may be enhanced by recycling promoter and/or RNAP II and other transcription related proteins more efficiently (47Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For example, a promoter might be “marked” as competent for reinitiation during the primary initiation event. Our RNAP II trapping experiments indicate, however, that under our conditions templates are in functional excess and are not being recycled. Similarly, whereas we did find that the concentration of RNAP II may be partially limiting in both extracts, recycling of RNAP II was not required in order to observe the difference in transcription levels between Ku80-negative and Ku80-positive nuclear extracts. Our results thus fall into the category of “kinetic limitation” described by Lei et al. (43Lei L. Ren D. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2130-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is interesting that the multiple round transcription defect in DNA-PK-deficient extracts resembles that observed by these workers with carboxyl-terminally truncated forms of the 74-kDa subunit of TFIIF (43Lei L. Ren D. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2130-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the effect of DNA-PK on multiple round transcription is mediated through phosphorylation of TFIIF in the carboxyl-terminal region. The activity of the 74-kDa subunit of TFIIF is known to be regulated by phosphorylation (48Kitajima S. Chibazakura T. Yonaha M. Yasukochi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29970-29977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TFIIF is phosphorylated by the TAFII 250-associated protein kinase (49Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), but it is not known if other kinases also contribute to its phosphorylation. It will be of interest to determine whether the pattern of TFIIF phosphorylation changes in the presence and absence of DNA-PK in vivo. Alternatively, DNA-PK could affect transcription by phosphorylation of a different general transcription or through interactions with an unknown or novel protein. This protein could facilitate active reloading of transcription factors at new promoters or releases nonproductively loaded factors from DNA. The extraordinarily large DNA-PK holoenzyme could serve as a nucleus for assembly of a multiprotein complex that carries out these functions. One of the important questions that remains to be answered, in addition to the identity of the missing factor, is whether DNA-PK-deficient cells are impaired in their ability to carry out transcription in vivo. In this respect, it is interesting to note that certain transcriptional activators are capable of binding to and stimulating the activity of DNA-PK (19Peterson S.R. Jesch S.A. Chamberlin T.N. Dvir A. Rabindran S.K. Wu C. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1449-1454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This interaction could provide a mechanism for increasing the level of reinitiation at specific promoters regulated by these factors. Moreover, mice lacking Ku 80 (50Nussenzweig A.

Kosman, submitted for publication. Several features of the regulatory activity of Mac1p have been described. For example,in vitro EMSA2 has demonstrated that Mac1p binds to a sequence in upstream activating regions of two genes whose expression is known to be Mac1p-dependent, CTR1 and FRE1 (4Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

These two genes encode a high affinity copper permease (9Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), respectively. The latter activity is required for both copper and iron uptake in yeast, that is reduction of medium Cu(II) and Fe(III) to the lower valent species is an essential first step of the accumulation of both metal ions (2Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 11Kosman D.J. Winkelmann G. Winge D.R. Metal Ions in Fungi.

For example, Mac1p- and copper-dependent protection of this region in one of these other loci, CTR3, which encodes a second copper permease not expressed in all yeast strains, has been demonstrated byin vivo DNA footprint analysis (7Labbé S.

Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and from the LexA protein (6Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), has provided evidence that Mac1p also has an inherent transactivation activity that is copper-dependent. The copper dependence of DNA binding and transactivation activity is negative, that is both activities are expressed in copper-deficient cells but are suppressed in copper-replete ones. The down-regulation of Mac1p activity occurs between 1 nm and 1 μm; at [copper] medium ≥1 μm little expression from the CTR1promoter is observed (5Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As shown in Scheme I, the core GCTC-binding site in the CTR1promoter is found within a nearly perfect palindrome; this element in the FRE1 locus is a direct repeat (sequences underlined in Scheme I). CTR3 also contains an inverted repeat which, however, is separated by 44 base pairs. That both GCTC sites are essential for transactivation by Mac1p has been indicated by previous studies that demonstrated loss of such activity in reporter promoter constructs derived from the FRE1 (10Dancis A.

The presence of this repeated motif suggested to us the possibility of Mac1p binding to both sites simultaneously if not cooperatively. Thus, the objective of the work described herein was to delineatein vitro the gross structural features of the Mac1p·DNA complex that had been demonstrated by EMSA (4Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M.

We first tested the hypothesis that the N-terminal domain of Mac1p, which contains a CCHC zinc finger motif (1Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S.

Thiele D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), was essential to the binding of Mac1p to DNA. We next evaluated the possible formation of ternary complexes, that is (Mac1p)2·DNA species, and determined what sequence characteristics in the DNA promoted such complex formation. We show a correlation between the in vivo activity of a promoter sequence and its ability to support formation of a (Mac1p)2·DNA ternary complex in vitro. Finally, we present data from a two-hybrid analysis that demonstrate that in this assay, at the least, a Mac1p-Mac1p interaction can be demonstrated. The data indicate that Mac1p can and does bind at both sites in the CTR1 promoter simultaneously and that formation of the resulting ternary complex correlates to downstream transcriptional activity. Three yeast strains were used in this study. For the one- and two-hybrid analyses, strain SFY526 (obtained from CLONTECH) was used as host (MATa ura3-52 his3-200 ade2-101 lys2-801 trp1-901 leu2-3, 112 can r gal4-542 gal80-538 URA3::GAL1-lacZ). For the promoter activity studies using CTR1 promoter-lacZ reporter plasmids, DEY1457 was used as host (MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3). This strain was obtained from David Eide (21Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For test of the complementing activity of mutant forms of Mac1p (ΔZFMac1p and ZF*Mac1p), DEY1457(mac1Δ) was used as host (DEY1457mac1::TRP1) (4Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The following media were used for culture growth: YPD was used for routine growth of wild type strains (2% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose); SC medium was used for routine selective growth of transformed strains (1.67 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose plus the appropriate drop-out (otherwise complete)) mixture of amino acids; for growth of copper-depleted cultures, a completely synthetic, Chelex-treated medium was used that was prepared as described previously (2Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This medium contained an estimated 0.5 nmresidual copper based on the amount of copper in the individual media components (as determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry) and the affinity of the Chelex resin for copper. This medium was subsequently supplemented with a trace metal mixture lacking copper to which copper was added as required for a given experiment. This medium was also used with glycerol replacing glucose as carbon source to test for the respiration competence of DEY1457 (mac1Δ) when performing functional tests of mutant forms of Mac1p. This is a standard test for mac1Δ-complementing clones that takes advantage of the iron (and, consequently, respiratory) deficiency in this background (1Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). All PCR-generated fragments, mutations, and reading frames in the plasmid constructs described below were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing using the T7 Sequenase 2.0 kit from Amersham Life Sciences, Inc. The DNA sequence for the Mac1p ORF was derived from the plasmid MAC16 that was obtained by inserting aMAC1 SacI (−162) to HindIII(+1997) fragment (1Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) into the complementary restriction sites in vector pRS316 (22Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ORF for ΔZFMac1p (lacking residues 1–41) was constructed using the endogenous NcoI site (+121) in MAC1 which includes the codon for Met-42. The NcoI (filled in)/SalI fragment from MAC16 was ligated into theSmaI/SalI sites in pGEM3Zf(+) (Promega) generating pGEM-ΔZF for in vitro synthesis of ΔZFMac1p and into the bait pGBT9 (giving pGB-ΔZF) and catch pGAD424 (giving pGAD-ZF) vectors for one- and two-hybrid analyses (23Bartel P.L. Chen C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). To construct whole Mac1p ORF fusions, the endogenous NcoI (+121) site in MAC16 was destroyed by PCR mutagenesis, and a new NcoI site was engineered at the +1 nucleotide (translation start). This modifiedNcoI(−1)/PstI(+210) fragment from MAC16 was exchanged with the NcoI(+121)/PstI(+210) fragment in pGB-ΔZF to generate pGB-MAC, comprising the whole Mac1p ORF. The recombinant NcoI(−1)/SalI(+1927) fragment from pGB-MAC was then subcloned into the catch vector pGAD424 (giving pGAD-MAC) and pGEM3Zf(+) (giving pGEM-MAC) as above. The double mutant ZF*Mac1p (C23S/H25N) was engineered by two rounds of PCR mutagenesis using pGEM-MAC as the template. TheNcoI(−1)/HindIII(+1927) fragment from pGEM-ZF*MAC was filled-in and subcloned into the SmaI sites in pGBT9 and pGAD424 to make plasmids pGB-ZF*MAC and pGAD-ZF*MAC, respectively. ΔZF-Mac1p and ZF*Mac1p were functionally tested by complementation in DEY1457Δmac1 in the following manner. The respective ORFs from pGEM-ΔZF and pGEM-ZF*MAC were subcloned into vector pADH; the resulting recombinants were subsequently transformed into the Mac1pminus strain and the transformants tested for respiration competence as described above. pADH was constructed from pGAD424 by replacing the HindIII fragment in this vector that contained all sequences from GAL4 by a multiple cloning site containing an NcoI site. Thus, pADH contained the yeast 2μ replication origin, the promoter and terminator from ADH1, and LEU2 for plasmid selection (23Bartel P.L. Chen C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). The wild type CTR1 promoter-lacZ fusion reporter plasmid was obtained from Andrew Dancis (see Ref. 9Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two promoter mutants, C5′AT-lacZ and C3′TA-lacZ, were derived from the wild type by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick-Change kit from Stratagene. For the former plasmid, the complementary primers used were 5′-GCAAATCATGGGATTTTTGCTCAAGAC and 5′-GTCTTGAGCAAAAATCCCATGATTTGC (A to T transition underlined), whereas for the latter the primers used were 5′-CGGTAAAATGAGCAAATATGGCACGATCC and 5′-GGATCGTGCCATATTTGCTCATTTTACCG (T to A transition underlined). The double-stranded oligonucleotides used in the EMSAs are given in Table I. A typical binding reaction contained 2–10 fmol of radiolabeled probe, 0.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 12% glycerol, 12 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, and competitor DNA when present (14Buchman C. Skroch P. Dixon W. Tullius T.D. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4778-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This 15-μl binding mixture, in addition, contained 3–5 μl of a wheat germ extract transcription-translation reaction (Promega) that had been programmed with either vector alone (typically pGEM3Zf(+)) or with vector containing either wild type or mutated Mac1p-encoding sequences. Binding reactions were performed by preincubation of all components except labeled probe for 10 min at room temperature with or without competitor DNA; 2–10 fmol of radiolabeled probe was then added, and the mixture was incubated for another 10 min at room temperature. The mixture was chilled on ice and then electrophoretically resolved on a 6.0% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and to Kodak BiomaxTM MR film. The screen was then read using a Bio-Rad model GS-505 PhosphorImager, and the digitized intensity data were then quantitated using Molecular Analyst 1.5. The EMSA figures herein were imaged directly from these digitized intensities. In Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, the relative amount of a given complex with respect to the control is shown using a bar graph; the control was the radioactivity associated with the faster migrating complex formed with the WT CTR1 promoter probe which we have assumed represents a binary Mac1p·DNA complex.

The base substitutions are underlined. To determine if the amount of input Mac1p protein was independent of the MAC1 construct used to program the wheat germ extract, each construct was expressed in the presence of [35S]methionine, the reaction mixture resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the dried gel developed by autoradiography. In all cases, a single Mac1p product was detected by appropriate molecular weight. Based on quantitation of the film by image analysis (Bio-Rad Gel Doc system) equivalent amounts of protein were produced from all templates. Yeast transformants were grown in the appropriate Chelex-treated/copper-supplemented defined medium for at least 5 doublings until the cultures reached mid-log phase (O.D.660 nm = 1.5–2.0). Samples (2 × 107 cells) were assayed in triplicate for β-galactosidase activity which was expressed in Miller units in the standard fashion (24Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 7 are from three independent experiments (samples in triplicate), and statistical significance of differences in mean values was determined with the use of InStat (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Two mutant forms of Mac1p were tested to demonstrate that DNA binding was due at least in part to the N-terminal portion of Mac1p (1Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) that was homologous to the zinc finger, DNA-binding domain in both Ace1p (15Dameron C.T. George G.N. Arnold P.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One mutant had an N-terminal 41-amino acid deletion (ΔZFMac1p). The other was a C23S/H25N double mutant designated ZF*Mac1p; Cys-23 and His-25 are two of the five conserved residues in the zinc finger-like motif found in the three trans-factors. These two constructs, as well as wild type Mac1p, were then tested by EMSA as shown in Fig. 1using the wild type CTR1 Mac1p-specific promoter element as probe (see Scheme I and Table I). Binding of wild type Mac1p to this probe was clearly evident (lane 4). In contrast, neither mutant protein yielded a detectable level of protein-DNA complex in this assay (ΔZFMac1p, lane 6; ZF*Mac1p, lane 8). Furthermore, neither mutant construct was capable of complementing a deletion in MAC1 when expressed in a Δmac1-containing background (see “Experimental Procedures” and data not shown). These results most reasonably suggest that a major determinant of functional Mac1p binding to DNA resides in the Ace1p/Amt1p homology element in the N-terminal domain of the protein. The repeated nature of the core GCTC element suggested to us the possible formation of a transcriptionally active protein-DNA complex, (Mac1p)2·DNA. We tested this model by first establishing the presence of such a complex by EMSA and then by delineating the sequence features of the DNA that promoted its formation. In fact, two mass species were apparent in an EMSA in which the wild type CTR1 sequence (WT, Table I) was used as probe (Fig.2, lane 3; see also Fig. 1, wild type Mac1p, lane 4). The more slowly migrating of these two complexes (shaded bar, quantitation below) was present with an abundance of 50% that of the faster migrating species (solid bar, quantitation below). We infer that the more slowly migrating species is larger in mass and arises from separate protein molecules binding to the two core elements. This inference is derived from the disappearance of this slowly migrating species when either core element was mutated indicating that two elements were required for the formation o"

In32P-labeled hippocampal neurons, exposure to 10 μm glutamate induced a long lasting increase in phosphorylation of MARCKS. The long lasting increase in MARCKS phosphorylation mainly required activation of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. Unexpectatively, the MARCKS phosphorylation after the 10-min incubation with glutamate was not inhibited by treatment with calphostin C, a potent inhibitor for protein kinase C (PKC), or down-regulation of PKC but was largely prevented by PD098059, a selective inhibitor for mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase. In contrast, the phosphorylation following the short exposure to glutamate was prevented by a combination of PD098059 and calphostin C. The phosphopeptide mapping and immunoblotting analyses confirmed that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of MARCKS was transient and the MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation was relatively persistent. Investigations of the functional properties also showed that the MARCKS phosphorylation by MAP kinase regulates its calmodulin-binding ability and its interaction with F-actin as seen in the PKC-dependent phosphorylation. These results suggest that glutamate causes a long lasting increase in MARCKS phosphorylation through activation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and subsequent activation of MAP kinase in the hippocampal neurons.

The myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS)1 with an apparent molecular mass of 80–87 kDa is a prototype of family members of prominent cellular substrates for protein kinase C (PKC). Comparison of known MARCKS sequences revealed three highly conserved regions: the N terminus, which contains a myristoylation consensus sequence, the MH2 domain, and a basic effector domain, which contains the PKC phosphorylation sites and calmodulin- and actin-binding sites (1Nairn A.C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within the basic internal domain of 25 residues, three or four serine residues are phosphorylated by PKC (4Graff J.M.

Commun. 1993; 190: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The potential to bind calcium/calmodulin and cross-links filamentous (F)-actin is regulated by PKC-dependent phosphorylation (4Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In addition, the PKC-dependent phosphorylation introduces negative charges into the basic cluster, reducing its electrostatic interaction with acidic lipids and results in translocation of MARCKS from membrane to cytoplasm (7Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A.

Genomic analysis with Southern blots and polymerase chain reactions revealed the presence of only the 87-kDa MARCKS gene in bovine and human genomes and only the 80-kDa MARCKS gene in the mouse and rat genomes. These are equivalent genes in the different species, and there is about 70% amino acid similarity between the 87-kDa and 80-kDa MARCKS (11Herget T. Brooks S.F. Broad S. Rozengurt E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). MacMARCKS, with a molecular mass of 48–60 kDa, is another member of the MARCKS family, which has been cloned from mouse macrophage (12Li J. Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 70: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and mouse brain (13Umekage T. Kato K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). MacMARCKS also has a myristoylated N terminus, a highly conserved MH2 domain, and a basic effector domain that contains PKC phosphorylation sites.Protein and mRNA of MARCKS are widely distributed and are most abundant in brain, spinal cord, spleen, and lung (14Stumpo D.J. Graff J.M. Albert K.A. Greengard P. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4012-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In the brain, MARCKS is widespread throughout the brain and is enriched in certain regions, including the piriform and entorhinal cortices, portions of the amygdaloid complex, the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the hypothalamus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, nucleus ambiguus, and many catecholaminergic and serotonergic nuclei (15Ouimet C.C. Wang J.K. Walaas S.I. Albert K.A. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1683-1698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In situhybridization also revealed a high expression of mRNA in the hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus (16McNamara R.K. Lenox R.H. J. Comp. Neurology. 1997; 379: 48-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis revealed immunoreactivity in axons, axon terminals, small dendritic branches, and occasionally in dendritic spines. No immunoreactive product was observed in large dendrites, somata, or nuclei (15Ouimet C.C. Wang J.K. Walaas S.I. Albert K.A. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1683-1698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of the MARCKS gene in mice leads to abnormal brain development and perinatal death, with defects in neurulation, fusion of the cerebral hemispheres, formation of the great forebrain commissures, and retinal and cortical lamination (17Stumpo D.J. Bock C.B. Tuttle J.S. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The observation suggests that expression of MARCKS during embryonic and fetal life in the mouse is necessary for normal brain development of the central nervous system.The properties of MARCKS, including cross-linking F-actin and binding to plasma membrane, suggest that MARCKS regulates actin-membrane interaction and in turn maintains cell shape and motility. Consistent with this hypothesis, MARCKS is phosphorylated during chemotaxis, secretion, and phagocytosis in neutrophils and macrophages (18Aderem A.A. Albert K.A. Keum M.M. Wang J.K. Greengard P. Cohn Z.A. Nature. 1988; 332: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1982; 79: 5249-5253Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21Wang J.K. Walaas S.I. Sihra T.S. Aderem A. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1983; 80: 7244-7248Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 23Blackshear P.J. Wen L. Glynn B.P. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1459-1469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC-dependent phosphorylation is possibly involved in functional roles of MARCKS. However, accumulating evidence has suggested that MARCKS is also an in vivo and in vitro substrate of proline-directed protein kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and cycline-dependent protein kinase (cdk) 5. A mass spectroscopic analysis of intact MARCKS purified from bovine brain revealed at least 6 phosphorylation sites in the Ser-Pro motif in the N-terminal domain and upstream of the phosphorylation sites for PKC (24Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the proline-directed protein kinases, such as MAP kinase (25Schönwaßer D.C. Palmer R.H. Herget T. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and cdc2 kinase or cdk5 (26Yamamoto H. Arakane F. Ono T. Tashima K. Okumura E. Yamada K. Hisanaga S. Fukunaga K. Kishimoto T. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), can phosphorylate recombinant mouse MARCKS and purified rat MARCKS, respectively.MAP kinase, especially ERK 2, was found to be widely expressed in whole rat brain and enriched in the hippocampal formation. In addition, neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors have been seen to activate MAP kinase in neurons (27Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 233-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 28Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 6: 79-95Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For example, activation of glutamate receptors, especially the NMDA receptor, causes a large increase in MAP kinase in the hippocampal neurons (29Bading H. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 253: 912-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 30Kurino M. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1282-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and stimulation of AMPA/kainate receptors elevated MAP kinase activity in cultured cortical neurons (31Fiore R.S. Murphy T.H. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Baraban J.M. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1626-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Similarly, basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor stimulate MAP kinase activity to the same extent as seen with glutamate (30Kurino M. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1282-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 32Marsh H.N. Palfrey H.C. J.

Eves E.M. Wainer B.H. Rosner M.R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1376-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Taken together, MAP kinase is a possible candidate for phosphorylation of MARCKS in vivo in the central nervous system. We now report that a long lasting increase in MARCKS phosphorylation in rat hippocampal neurons following stimulation of the glutamate receptor was mainly though the NMDA receptor activation and is due to activation of MAP kinase rather than PKC. Furthermore, a transient increase in the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of MARCKS was observed following stimulation of the glutamate receptors.DISCUSSIONIn neutrophils and macrophages, MARCKS is phosphorylated during chemotaxis, secretion, and phagocytosis (18Aderem A.A.

Because this phosphorylation seems to be closely associated with activation of PKC and its abilities to bind calcium/calmodulin and cross-link actin filaments are directly regulated by the PKC-dependent phosphorylation (4Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21818-21823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), the physiological functions of MARCKS would appear to be mainly regulated by PKC in vivo. However, mass spectrometrical analysis using purified bovine MARCKS demonstrated six novel phosphorylation sites in addition to the known PKC phosphorylation sites (24Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The endogenous phosphorylation by PKC was a minor portion and all the novel sites were serine residues, followed immediately by proline residues, which means that MARCKS is also a good substrate for proline-directed protein kinase, including MAP kinase and cdk5, in vivo.We reported activation of PKC and MAP kinase, as well as CaM kinase II, in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (30Kurino M. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1282-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 38Fukunaga K. Soderling T.R. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22527-22533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We focused on activation of the protein kinase cascades following the activation of NMDA receptors in the hippocampal neurons, because NMDA receptor activity was exclusively associated with synaptic plasticity in the developing brain as well as in the adult brain. For example, activation of CaM kinase II in cultured hippocampal neurons was predominantly regulated by the activity of the NMDA receptor, because glutamate-induced activation of CaM kinase II was only inhibited by addition of the NMDA receptor antagonist but not by antagonists of AMPA/kainate and the metabotropic receptors (38Fukunaga K. Soderling T.R. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22527-22533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NMDA receptor-dependent activation of CaM kinase II was also evident in the long term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 regions (51Fukunaga K. Stoppini L. Miyamoto E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7863-7867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The potentiation of CaM kinase II was closely associated with the induction of LTP, in an NMDA receptor-dependent manner (51Fukunaga K. Stoppini L. Miyamoto E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7863-7867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Fukunaga K. Muller D. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6119-6124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of MAP kinase by stimulation with glutamate was primarily due to activation of the NMDA receptor (30Kurino M. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1282-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The activation of MAP kinase may be related to the induction of LTP in the CA1 region, because PD098059 attenuated the induction of LTP (53English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol.

Thus, MAP kinase became an attractive candidate related to the underlying the molecular basis for expressing a stable LTP in CA1 regions.In the present study, we demonstrated that MARCKS is one in vivo substrate for MAP kinase following stimulation of glutamate receptors. MARCKS phosphorylation was sustained during more than 30 min after glutamate stimulation, a long lasting increase predominantly due to activation of the NMDA receptor. In addition, the long lasting glutamate-induced MARCKS phosphorylation was largely prevented by PD098059, a MAP kinase kinase inhibitor but not by a PKC inhibitor. When examining our previous results in terms of MAP kinase activation by stimulation of the glutamate receptors, the time course of glutamate-induced MARCKS phosphorylation was closely related to that of MAP kinase activation, in which the NMDA receptor activation was mainly involved (30Kurino M. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1282-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Treatment with PD098059 totally inhibited the glutamate-induced MAP kinase activation, as shown in the present study. Consistent with these observations, the major site for MAP kinase detected by HPLC analysis was mainly potentiated after a 10-min exposure to glutamate. The phosphorylation of the major site for MAP kinase was elevated even after a 30-min incubation (data not shown). The finding of one major peak in MARCKS phosphorylated in vitro by MAP kinase is consistent with findings that Ser-113 in mouse MARCKS and Ser-116 in bovine MARCKS were mainly phosphorylated by the purified MAP kinase in vitro (24Taniguchi H. Manenti S. Suzuki M. Titani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18299-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schönwaßer D.C. Palmer R.H. Herget T. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Schönwaßer et al. (25Schönwaßer D.C. Palmer R.H. Herget T. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the mutation of Ser-113 to alanine in MARCKS largely abolished the phosphorylation by MAP kinase. However, Ser-113 was not phosphorylated in permeabilized Swiss 3T3 cells after stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor as well as PMA (25Schönwaßer D.C. Palmer R.H. Herget T. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because platelet-derived growth factor activates MAP kinase in a variety of cells, the phosphorylation of MARCKS by MAP kinase may not generally occur. In hippocampal neurons, MARCKS may be an important substrate for MAP kinase, because stimulation with brain-derived neurotrophic factor in hippocampal neurons could also elicit an increase in MARCKS phosphorylation by MAP kinase. 3M. Kanahori, K. Fukunaga, and E. Miyamoto, unpublished data.The present study demonstrated that stimulation of hippocampal neurons with glutamate elicits biphasic increases in phosphorylation of MARCKS: that is, phosphorylation with PKC through the metabotropic glutamate receptor in a short period and with MAP kinase through activation of the NMDA receptor over a long period. This was confirmed by using a specific antibody that recognizes PKC-phosphorylation sites. These results are consistent with previous observations that glutamate-induced translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fraction was transient and were reverted to basal levels in 5 min (38Fukunaga K. Soderling T.R. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22527-22533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The translocation of PKC was only inhibited by addition of an inhibitor for the metabotropic glutamate receptor (38Fukunaga K. Soderling T.R. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22527-22533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient increase in phosphorylation of MARCKS was noted in hippocampal neurons (54Scholz W.K. Palfrey H.C. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2422-2432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cerebellar granule cells (55Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. Eur. J.

Brain Res. 1993; 73: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It is important to determine which kinase is involved in the phosphorylation described in previous works (54Scholz W.K.

The phosphopeptides eluted in fractions 38–42 were not identified. It has not been elucidated how cdc2 kinase and cdk5 are activated by external stimuli for receptors, although these kinases are expressed in neurons (57Hellmich M.R. Pant H.C. Wada E. Battey J.F.

MAP kinase-induced phosphorylation of synapsin I was noted in cultured cortical neurons following stimulation with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (41Jovanovic J.N. Benfenati F. Siow Y.L. Sihra T.S. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Greengard P. Czernik A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3679-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Synapsin I is predominantly located in presynaptic regions and regulates the binding between synaptic vesicles and actin filaments. In vitrophosphorylation of synapsin I by MAP kinase reduced the ability of cross-linking of actin filaments but had no evident effect on the binding ability to synaptic vesicles. The regulation of bundling of actin filaments by synapsin I phosphorylation through MAP kinase suggests that MAP kinase is implicated in neurite extension rather than exocytosis in the phosphorylation of synapsin I. On the other hand, MARCKS, which is also enriched in nerve terminals, regulates interactions between actin filaments and plasma membranes. In this context, we investigated the physiological significance of MARCKS phosphorylation by MAP kinase. The phosphorylation by MAP kinase significantly regulated the interaction between MARCKS and F-actin rather than its CaM-binding ability. The results suggest a potential role of MAP kinase in the regulation of F-actin-membrane interaction. The site for MAP kinase, Ser-113, is located in the near upstream site for the central PKC phosphorylation domain that includes Ser-152, Ser-156, and Ser-163 and is conserved in all members of the MARCKS family and MacMARCKS. The inhibitory effect of phosphorylation of Ser-113 by MAP kinase on binding to calmodulin may be due to conformational changes in the MARCKS structure. In cerebellar granule cells, involvement of MARCKS phosphorylation in NMDA-stimulated neurite outgrowth was suggested as MARCKS was present in neurites and growth cones (55Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated that MARCKS is also present in neurites and the varicosity-like structure, as based on light microscopic observations of cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2). Further investigation of localization of MARCKS phosphorylated by MAP kinase is needed to clarify the roles of MARCKS in the central nervous system. MARCKS may serve as a good substrate for MAP kinase during the LTP expression, because MARCKS can provide a reversible cross-bridge between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane, which may contribute to reorganization or morphological changes in synapses in the hippocampus during LTP expression. The myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS)1 with an apparent molecular mass of 80–87 kDa is a prototype of family members of prominent cellular substrates for protein kinase C (PKC). Comparison of known MARCKS sequences revealed three highly conserved regions: the N terminus, which contains a myristoylation consensus sequence, the MH2 domain, and a basic effector domain, which contains the PKC phosphorylation sites and calmodulin- and actin-binding sites (1Nairn A.C.

Commun. 1993; 190: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The potential to bind calcium/calmodulin and cross-links filamentous (F)-actin is regulated by PKC-dependent phosphorylation (4Graff J.M. Young T.N. Johnson J.D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In addition, the PKC-dependent phosphorylation introduces negative charges into the basic cluster, reducing its electrostatic interaction with acidic lipids and results in translocation of MARCKS from membrane to cytoplasm (7Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A.

Genomic analysis with Southern blots and polymerase chain reactions revealed the presence of only the 87-kDa MARCKS gene in bovine and human genomes and only the 80-kDa MARCKS gene in the mouse and rat genomes. These are equivalent genes in the different species, and there is about 70% amino acid similarity between the 87-kDa and 80-kDa MARCKS (11Herget T. Brooks S.F. Broad S. Rozengurt E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). MacMARCKS, with a molecular mass of 48–60 kDa, is another member of the MARCKS family, which has been cloned from mouse macrophage (12Li J. Aderem A.

ACh (50 nm-5 μm) increased [Ca2+]i and evokedIm currents without alteringIj in 19 of 37 acinar cell pairs. Although [Ca2+]i rose asynchronously in cells comprising a cluster, the delay of the [Ca2+]i responses decreased with increasing ACh concentrations. Perfusion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) into one cell of a cluster resulted in [Ca2+]i responses in neighboring cells that were not necessarily in direct contact with the stimulated one. This suggests that extensive coupling between acinar cells provides a pathway for cell-to-cell diffusion of Ca2+-releasing signals. Strikingly, maximal (1–5 μm) ACh concentrations reduced Ijby 69 ± 15% (n = 9) in 25% of the cell pairs subjected to dual patch-clamping. This decrease occurred shortly after the Im peak and was prevented by incubating acinar cells in a Ca2+-free medium, suggesting that uncoupling was subsequent to the initiation of the Ca2+-mobilizing responses. Depletion of Ca2+-sequestering stores by thapsigargin resulted in a reduction of intercellular communication similar to that observed with ACh. In addition, ACh-induced uncoupling was prevented by blocking nitric oxide production with l-nitro-arginine and restored by exposing acinar cells to dibutyryl cGMP.

Gap junctions are intercellular channels formed by twelve subunits of membrane proteins called connexins (Cx).1 Six subunits are contributed by each cell to form hemichannels, the docking of which provides a low resistance pathway for exchange of ions and small molecules between cells in contact. Gap junctional coupling was shown to be involved in the control of embryonic development, cell proliferation, electrical conduction, and metabolic cooperation (1Bennett M.V.L.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Because gap junction channels allow for the potential passage of molecules of a molecular mass up to 1000 Da, it is conceivable that second messengers produced in one cell can diffuse between neighboring cells to coordinate their individual response. In support of this hypothesis, the passage of Ca2+ waves has been reported in epithelial cells, glial cells, and various cultured cells (4Sanderson M.J. News Physiol. Sci. 1996; 11: 262-269Google Scholar).The exocrine pancreas represents a valuable model to search for the role of gap junctional coupling in signal transduction of nonexcitable tissues. Acinar cells are extensively electrically and chemically coupled by Cx32- and Cx26-built gap junction channels (5Meda P. Bruzzone R. Chanson M. Bosco D. Hertzberg E.L. Johnson R.G. Modern Cell Biology. 7. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 353-364Google Scholar). A major group of secretagogues in these cells are the Ca2+-mobilizing agonists, including cholecystokinin and acetylcholine (ACh). In the highly polarized acinar cells, cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) initially rises within the apical secretory region and, when stimulation is sufficient, subsequently spreads as a wave toward the basal pole of the cell (6Kasai H.

Intercellular propagation of Ca2+ oscillations and/or Ca2+ waves elicited by Ca2+-mobilizing secretagogues has been reported to correlate with gap junctional activity (7Nathanson M.H. Padfield P.J.

Increasing evidence indicates that open gap junctions coordinate the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations within individual cells of a same acinus which, in turn, regulates enzyme secretion. This hypothesis, however, is in apparent contradiction with the observation that these secretagogues also evoke acinar cell uncoupling, both in vitro and in vivo, at concentrations that maximally stimulate enzyme secretion (14Petersen O.H. Ueda N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1975; 247: 461-471Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Iwatsuki N. Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1978; 274: 81-96Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Meda P.

Physiol. 1991; 261: G28-G36PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the role of gap junctional coupling during acute stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells remains tantalizing.One of the first questions to address is whether rises in [Ca2+]i and changes in junctional coupling evoked by acinar cell stimulation are parallel events. The application of the patch-clamp technique to dissociated acinar cells has revealed that the kinetic of Ca2+-dependent membrane current activation reflects that of the [Ca2+]i changes (18Osipchuk Y.V. Wakui M. Yule D.I. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Maruyama Y. Inooka G. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Kasai H.

Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). However, accurate monitoring of junctional conductance under dual whole-cell recording conditions has been limited because spontaneous uncoupling occurs within seconds, presumably as a result of cytoplasm dialysis (21Neyton J. Trautmann A. Nature. 1985; 317: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 22Chanson M. Bruzzone R. Spray D.C. Regazzi R. Meda P. Am. J.

To bypass this problem, we applied here a dual perforated patch-clamp approach, which preserves the integrity of the internal milieu (24Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar, 25Takens-Kwak B.R. Jongsma H.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1992; 422: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), to monitor pairs of acinar cells stimulated with increasing ACh concentrations for both Ca2+-dependent membrane and gap junctional currents. In parallel experiments, changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored by digital imaging of fluo-3-loaded acinar cells. Under these conditions, we observed that ACh-induced closure of gap junction channels parallels the phase plateau of the [Ca2+]i response, but not the initial peak. We further show that acinar cell uncoupling requires the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and parallels capacitative Ca2+ entry.DISCUSSIONOur results describe the temporal relationship between changes in [Ca2+]i and gap junctional conductance within pairs of pancreatic acinar cells exposed to ACh. Uncoupling of pancreatic acinar cells by concentrations of Ca2+-mobilizing secretagogues that maximally stimulate exocrine secretion is well documented (14Petersen O.H. Ueda N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1975; 247: 461-471Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Iwatsuki N. Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1978; 274: 81-96Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Meda P. Bruzzone R. Chanson M.

However, the intracellular mechanism that mediates this effect is not known (38Chanson M. Meda P. Hall J.E. Zampighi G.A. Davis R.M. Progress in Cell Research. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1993: 199-205Google Scholar). Using a dual perforated patch-clamp approach and confocal digital imaging, we report here that ACh-induced uncoupling and [Ca2+]i changes had distinct kinetics. Thus, decrease in junctional conductance of acinar cells consistently develops after the initial [Ca2+]i peak and is maximal during the [Ca2+]i plateau. Furthermore, ACh-induced uncoupling was no longer detected when reloading of internal Ca2+ stores was prevented by incubation of the cells in a Ca2+-free medium. These results suggest that depletion-activated Ca2+ entry was a key determinant for the ACh-induced uncoupling of acinar cells.In many nonexcitable cells, depletion of intracellular Ca2+stores by IP3 is the primary mechanism by which cell surface receptors activate Ca2+ influx. This phenomenon, which is termed capacitative Ca2+ entry (33Putney J.W. Bird G. St J. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), has been involved in the control of Ca2+ oscillations (32Berridge M.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The signal that couples store depletion to Ca2+ entry has not yet been identified (33Putney J.W. Bird G. St J. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In pancreatic acinar cells, however, there is definite evidence that NO produced by nitric-oxide synthase mediates the stimulation of cGMP formation by cholinergic agonists. cGMP, in turn, is known to modulate Ca2+ entry (29Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bahnson T.D. Pandol S.J. Dionne V.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29169-29175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, we observed that activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry by either depletion of internal Ca2+stores with thapsigargin or by exposure of acinar cells to dibutyryl cGMP decreased intercellular communication to an extent similar to that observed with ACh alone. Side effects of these agents on intercellular communication appear unlikely because uncoupling was abolished in acini that were depleted for their internal Ca2+ and incubated in a Ca2+-free medium. In addition, cell uncoupling evoked by ACh was prevented in the presence of a nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, supporting the view that gap junctional conductance and capacitative Ca2+ entry are concurrently regulated. These results, however, do not rule out the possibility that capacitative Ca2+ entry may activate another intracellular pathway leading to modulation of junctional conductance. Support for this idea is provided by the earlier observation that okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor that modulates capacitative Ca2+ entry (44Berlin R.D. Preston S.F.

Pfluegers Arch. 1992; 422: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and nitric oxide (46Lu C. McMahon D.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 689-699Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), our data provide the first observation that ACh-induced uncoupling is linked to capacitative Ca2+entry.Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have documented a relationship between intercellular communication and the secretory activity of pancreatic acinar cells (17Chanson M.

In this context, gap junctional coupling is thought to coordinate the Ca2+ response of individual acinar cells within an acinus and thereby to regulate exocytosis (11Stauffer P.L. Zhao H.

This idea is supported by our present finding that the large and stable junctional conductance observed in most acinar cell pairs was not altered during changes in [Ca2+]i evoked by ACh. In agreement with a previous study using cholecystokinin (13Yule D.I. Stuenkel E. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1285-C1294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that rises in [Ca2+]i were asynchronous in acinar cells stimulated with low concentrations of ACh. Increasing the agonist concentration was associated with shortening of the delay between the onset of the Ca2+ responses, suggesting that these cells were coupled in terms of Ca2+mobilization. Also, perfusion of IP3 into one cell evoked a rise in [Ca2+]i in neighboring cells even though not necessarily in those that directly contacted the stimulated one. This observation suggests that rat pancreatic acinar cells differ in their ability to mobilize Ca2+ from internal stores, as indicated by previous studies reporting similar heterogeneity in [Ca2+]imobilization (31Willems P.H.G.M.

This differential responsiveness may be essential to provide a properly modulable response to agonist-specific stimulation (11Stauffer P.L. Zhao H. Luby-Phelps K. Moss R.L. Star R.A. Muallem S. J.

Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).These results, however, are not immediately reconcilable with the observation that ACh decreases gap junctional coupling while maximally stimulating the secretory activity of acinar cells (30Meda P.

The blockade of acinar cell-to-cell communication is known to enhance the basal release of amylase in vitro and in vivo(16Meda P. Bruzzone R. Chanson M. Bosco D. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4901-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Chanson M. Bruzzone R. Bosco D. Meda P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Meda P.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Under conditions of gap junction blockade, the potency of several agonists in stimulating exocytosis has also been found to be reduced when the effect of acinar cell uncoupling on basal secretion was taken into account (11Stauffer P.L. Zhao H. Luby-Phelps K. Moss R.L. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19769-19775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Meda P. Bruzzone R. Chanson M. Bosco D. Orci L. Proc. Natl.

Therefore, uncoupling may provide acinar cells with a mechanism to sustain enzyme release during acute stimulation by increasing their rate of basal secretion. In this context, the delayed uncoupling evoked by ACh may compartmentalize cells that are highly sensitive to ACh from cells that are less sensitive to the secretagogue, therefore decreasing the effective volume of cytoplasm of interconnected cells. This regulation may be essential to ensure that the intracellular levels of critical factor(s) are maintained to allow for sustained activity of groups of actively secreting cells. Future studies should determine whether uncoupling induced by Ca2+ store depletion is a common mechanism to control junctional communication in other types of nonexcitable cells. Gap junctions are intercellular channels formed by twelve subunits of membrane proteins called connexins (Cx).1 Six subunits are contributed by each cell to form hemichannels, the docking of which provides a low resistance pathway for exchange of ions and small molecules between cells in contact. Gap junctional coupling was shown to be involved in the control of embryonic development, cell proliferation, electrical conduction, and metabolic cooperation (1Bennett M.V.L.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Because gap junction channels allow for the potential passage of molecules of a molecular mass up to 1000 Da, it is conceivable that second messengers produced in one cell can diffuse between neighboring cells to coordinate their individual response. In support of this hypothesis, the passage of Ca2+ waves has been reported in epithelial cells, glial cells, and various cultured cells (4Sanderson M.J. News Physiol. Sci. 1996; 11: 262-269Google Scholar). The exocrine pancreas represents a valuable model to search for the role of gap junctional coupling in signal transduction of nonexcitable tissues. Acinar cells are extensively electrically and chemically coupled by Cx32- and Cx26-built gap junction channels (5Meda P. Bruzzone R. Chanson M. Bosco D. Hertzberg E.L. Johnson R.G. Modern Cell Biology. 7. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 353-364Google Scholar). A major group of secretagogues in these cells are the Ca2+-mobilizing agonists, including cholecystokinin and acetylcholine (ACh). In the highly polarized acinar cells, cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) initially rises within the apical secretory region and, when stimulation is sufficient, subsequently spreads as a wave toward the basal pole of the cell (6Kasai H. Agustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 7Nathanson M.H. Padfield P.J. O'Sullivan A.J. Burghstahler A.D. Jamieson J.D. J. Biol.

Intercellular propagation of Ca2+ oscillations and/or Ca2+ waves elicited by Ca2+-mobilizing secretagogues has been reported to correlate with gap junctional activity (7Nathanson M.H. Padfield P.J.

Stuenkel E. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1285-C1294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that open gap junctions coordinate the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations within individual cells of a same acinus which, in turn, regulates enzyme secretion. This hypothesis, however, is in apparent contradiction with the observation that these secretagogues also evoke acinar cell uncoupling, both in vitro and in vivo, at concentrations that maximally stimulate enzyme secretion (14Petersen O.H. Ueda N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1975; 247: 461-471Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Iwatsuki N. Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1978; 274: 81-96Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Meda P.

Physiol. 1991; 261: G28-G36PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the role of gap junctional coupling during acute stimulation of pancreatic acinar cells remains tantalizing. One of the first questions to address is whether rises in [Ca2+]i and changes in junctional coupling evoked by acinar cell stimulation are parallel events. The application of the patch-clamp technique to dissociated acinar cells has revealed that the kinetic of Ca2+-dependent membrane current activation reflects that of the [Ca2+]i changes (18Osipchuk Y.V. Wakui M. Yule D.I. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Maruyama Y. Inooka G. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Kasai H. EMBO J. 1993; 8: 3017-3022Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). However, accurate monitoring of junctional conductance under dual whole-cell recording conditions has been limited because spontaneous uncoupling occurs within seconds, presumably as a result of cytoplasm dialysis (21Neyton J. Trautmann A. Nature. 1985; 317: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 22Chanson M. Bruzzone R. Spray D.C. Regazzi R. Meda P. Am. J.

To bypass this problem, we applied here a dual perforated patch-clamp approach, which preserves the integrity of the internal milieu (24Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar, 25Takens-Kwak B.R. Jongsma H.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1992; 422: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), to monitor pairs of acinar cells stimulated with increasing ACh concentrations for both Ca2+-dependent membrane and gap junctional currents. In parallel experiments, changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored by digital imaging of fluo-3-loaded acinar cells. Under these conditions, we observed that ACh-induced closure of gap junction channels parallels the phase plateau of the [Ca2+]i response, but not the initial peak. We further show that acinar cell uncoupling requires the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and parallels capacitative Ca2+ entry. DISCUSSIONOur results describe the temporal relationship between changes in [Ca2+]i and gap junctional conductance within pairs of pancreatic acinar cells exposed to ACh. Uncoupling of pancreatic acinar cells by concentrations of Ca2+-mobilizing secretagogues that maximally stimulate exocrine secretion is well documented (14Petersen O.H. Ueda N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1975; 247: 461-471Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Iwatsuki N. Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1978; 274: 81-96Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Meda P. Bruzzone R. Chanson M. Bosco D. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4901-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Chanson M. Orci L. Meda P. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G28-G36PubMed Google Scholar). However, the intracellular mechanism that mediates this effect is not known (38Chanson M. Meda P. Hall J.E. Zampighi G.A. Davis R.M. Progress in Cell Research. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1993: 199-205Google Scholar). Using a dual perforated patch-clamp approach and confocal digital imaging, we report here that ACh-induced uncoupling and [Ca2+]i changes had distinct kinetics. Thus, decrease in junctional conductance of acinar cells consistently develops after the initial [Ca2+]i peak and is maximal during the [Ca2+]i plateau. Furthermore, ACh-induced uncoupling was no longer detected when reloading of internal Ca2+ stores was prevented by incubation of the cells in a Ca2+-free medium. These results suggest that depletion-activated Ca2+ entry was a key determinant for the ACh-induced uncoupling of acinar cells.In many nonexcitable cells, depletion of intracellular Ca2+stores by IP3 is the primary mechanism by which cell surface receptors activate Ca2+ influx. This phenomenon, which is termed capacitative Ca2+ entry (33Putney J.W. Bird G. St J. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), has been involved in the control of Ca2+ oscillations (32Berridge M.J.

A. 1995; 92: 7907-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and enzymatic regulation (41Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The signal that couples store depletion to Ca2+ entry has not yet been identified (33Putney J.W. Bird G. St J. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In pancreatic acinar cells, however, there is definite evidence that NO produced by nitric-oxide synthase mediates the stimulation of cGMP formation by cholinergic agonists. cGMP, in turn, is known to modulate Ca2+ entry (29Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bahnson T.D. Pandol S.J. Dionne V.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29169-29175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, we observed that activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry by either depletion of internal Ca2+stores with thapsigargin or by exposure of acinar cells to dibutyryl cGMP decreased intercellular communication to an extent similar to that observed with ACh alone. Side effects of these agents on intercellular communication appear unlikely because uncoupling was abolished in acini that were depleted for their internal Ca2+ and incubated in a Ca2+-free medium. In addition, cell uncoupling evoked by ACh was prevented in the presence of a nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, supporting the view that gap junctional conductance and capacitative Ca2+ entry are concurrently regulated. These results, however, do not rule out the possibility that capacitative Ca2+ entry may activate another intracellular pathway leading to modulation of junctional conductance. Support for this idea is provided by the earlier observation that okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor that modulates capacitative Ca2+ entry (44Berlin R.D. Preston S.F.

Therefore, uncoupling may provide acinar cells with a mechanism to sustain enzyme release during acute stimulation by increasing their rate of basal secretion.

Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1993: 199-205Google Scholar). Using a dual perforated patch-clamp approach and confocal digital imaging, we report here that ACh-induced uncoupling and [Ca2+]i changes had distinct kinetics. Thus, decrease in junctional conductance of acinar cells consistently develops after the initial [Ca2+]i peak and is maximal during the [Ca2+]i plateau. Furthermore, ACh-induced uncoupling was no longer detected when reloading of internal Ca2+ stores was prevented by incubation of the cells in a Ca2+-free medium. These results suggest that depletion-activated Ca2+ entry was a key determinant for the ACh-induced uncoupling of acinar cells. In many nonexcitable cells, depletion of intracellular Ca2+stores by IP3 is the primary mechanism by which cell surface receptors activate Ca2+ influx. This phenomenon, which is termed capacitative Ca2+ entry (33Putney J.W. Bird G. St J. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), has been involved in the control of Ca2+ oscillations (32Berridge M.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The signal that couples store depletion to Ca2+ entry has not yet been identified (33Putney J.W. Bird G. St J. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In pancreatic acinar cells, however, there is definite evidence that NO produced by nitric-oxide synthase mediates the stimulation of cGMP formation by cholinergic agonists. cGMP, in turn, is known to modulate Ca2+ entry (29Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bahnson T.D. Pandol S.J. Dionne V.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29169-29175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, we observed that activation of capacitative Ca2+ entry by either depletion of internal Ca2+stores with thapsigargin or by exposure of acinar cells to dibutyryl cGMP decreased intercellular communication to an extent similar to that observed with ACh alone. Side effects of these agents on intercellular communication appear unlikely because uncoupling was abolished in acini that were depleted for their internal Ca2+ and incubated in a Ca2+-free medium. In addition, cell uncoupling evoked by ACh was prevented in the presence of a nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, supporting the view that gap junctional conductance and capacitative Ca2+ entry are concurrently regulated. These results, however, do not rule out the possibility that capacitative Ca2+ entry may activate another intracellular pathway leading to modulation of junctional conductance. Support for this idea is provided by the earlier observation that okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor that modulates capacitative Ca2+ entry (44Berlin R.D. Preston S.F. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), also prevents ACh-induced uncoupling (38Chanson M. Meda P. Hall J.E. Zampighi G.A. Davis R.M. Progress in Cell Research. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1993: 199-205Google Scholar). Although several studies have shown that gap junction channels are blocked by cGMP (25Takens-Kwak B.R. Jongsma H.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1992; 422: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and nitric oxide (46Lu C. McMahon D.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 689-699Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), our data provide the first observation that ACh-induced uncoupling is linked to capacitative Ca2+entry. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have documented a relationship between intercellular communication and the secretory activity of pancreatic acinar cells (17Chanson M. Orci L. Meda P. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G28-G36PubMed Google Scholar, 30Meda P. Bruzzone R. Knodel S. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 47Chanson M. Fanjul M. Bosco D. Nelles E. Suter S. Willecke K. Meda P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this context, gap junctional coupling is thought to coordinate the Ca2+ response of individual acinar cells within an acinus and thereby to regulate exocytosis (11Stauffer P.L. Zhao H. Luby-Phelps K. Moss R.L. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19769-19775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Bosco D. Soriano J.V. Chanson M. Meda P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by our present finding that the large and stable junctional conductance observed in most acinar cell pairs was not altered during changes in [Ca2+]i evoked by ACh. In agreement with a previous study using cholecystokinin (13Yule D.I. Stuenkel E. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1285-C1294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that rises in [Ca2+]i were asynchronous in acinar cells stimulated with low concentrations of ACh. Increasing the agonist concentration was associated with shortening of the delay between the onset of the Ca2+ responses, suggesting that these cells were coupled in terms of Ca2+mobilization. Also, perfusion of IP3 into one cell evoked a rise in [Ca2+]i in neighboring cells even though not necessarily in those that directly contacted the stimulated one. This observation suggests that rat pancreatic acinar cells differ in their ability to mobilize Ca2+ from internal stores, as indicated by previous studies reporting similar heterogeneity in [Ca2+]imobilization (31Willems P.H.G.M. Van Emst-De Vries S.E. Van Os C.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and amylase secretion (48Bosco D. Soriano J.V. Chanson M. Meda P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 49Bosco D. Chanson M. Bruzzone R. Meda P. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: G664-G670PubMed Google Scholar). This differential responsiveness may be essential to provide a properly modulable response to agonist-specific stimulation (11Stauffer P.L. Zhao H. Luby-Phelps K. Moss R.L. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19769-19775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Yule D.I. Lawrie A.M. Petersen O.H. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These results, however, are not immediately reconcilable with the observation that ACh decreases gap junctional coupling while maximally stimulating the secretory activity of acinar cells (30Meda P. Bruzzone R. Knodel S. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 47Chanson M. Fanjul M. Bosco D. Nelles E. Suter S. Willecke K. Meda P. J.

The blockade of acinar cell-to-cell communication is known to enhance the basal release of amylase in vitro and in vivo(16Meda P. Bruzzone R. Chanson M. Bosco D. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4901-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Chanson M. Bruzzone R. Bosco D. Meda P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Meda P.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Under conditions of gap junction blockade, the potency of several agonists in stimulating exocytosis has also been found to be reduced when the effect of acinar cell uncoupling on basal secretion was taken into account (11Stauffer P.L. Zhao H. Luby-Phelps K. Moss R.L. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19769-19775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Meda P. Bruzzone R. Chanson M. Bosco D. Orci L. Proc. Natl.

Therefore, uncoupling may provide acinar cells with a mechanism to sustain enzyme release during acute stimulation by increasing their rate of basal secretion. In this context, the delayed uncoupling evoked by ACh may compartmentalize cells that are highly sensitive to ACh from cells that are less sensitive to the secretagogue, therefore decreasing the effective volume of cytoplasm of interconnected cells. This regulation may be essential to ensure that the intracellular levels of critical factor(s) are maintained to allow for sustained activity of groups of actively secreting cells. Future studies should determine whether uncoupling induced by Ca2+ store depletion is a common mechanism to control junctional communication in other types of nonexcitable cells. We thank D.

https://openalex.org/W2091110596,"Phosphorylation by protein kinase C of isoform 4a of the human plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (hPMCA4a) was studied using the COS cell expression system. Phosphorylation of several truncated mutants of hPMCA4a indicated that a single phosphorylation site lies in a region between residues 1113 and 1125. This region is within the calmodulin binding domain and contains a single phosphorylatable residue, serine 1115. Converting this serine to an alanine diminished phosphorylation greatly. Phosphorylation, done in the absence of calmodulin, did not affect subsequent calmodulin binding, but previous binding of calmodulin did inhibit phosphorylation. Moreover, no significant shift in the calmodulin response curve of hPMCA4a was observed when phosphorylation was mimicked by converting serine 1115 to an acidic residue. The calmodulin binding domain of hPMCA4a is much longer than other calmodulin binding domains and has been suggested to consist of two binding lobes interrupted by a short nonbinding region. The findings of this study indicate that serine 1115 is the residue phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and that it lies within the nonbinding region of the calmodulin binding domain.

The plasma membrane Ca2+ pump, with its high Ca2+ affinity, appears to be responsible for maintaining the low resting level of Ca2+ in the unstimulated cell. The activity of this pump is controlled by several different means: by calmodulin, acidic phospholipids, phosphorylation with protein kinases, proteolysis, and dimerization. Most of the regulatory determinants of the enzyme are located at its carboxyl terminus. This region contains the high affinity calmodulin binding site, an autoinhibitory region, sites for phosphorylation with protein kinases C and A, and cleavage sites for proteolysis (1Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 23B: 247-272Google Scholar, 2Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). It is a highly variable region displaying great diversity between the different PMCA1 isoforms. The pump is encoded by four different genes, and an additional variability is produced by alternative RNA splicing so that the number of possible transcripts of the pump is >20 (3Strehler E.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 120: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The alternative splices at site C alone create ∼10 protein variants. This site is located in the middle of the region coding for the calmodulin binding domain, and the splices involve a frameshift that changes all of the downstream residues. Because these splices are in the regulatory region, the different pump variants are expected to have different regulatory properties. In hPMCA4 such a variation has been shown to have a striking effect on the calmodulin binding and basal activity (4Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Heim R. Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 41-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These structural changes also cause a major change in the sites available for phosphorylation by protein kinases. Although all isoforms show a great proportion of serine and threonine residues at the carboxyl terminus, the locations of consensus sequences for phosphorylation are quite different from one isoform to the other (1Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 23B: 247-272Google Scholar). The alternate splice, especially, has a profound effect on the location of the phosphorylatable residues in this region. The regulatory region of hPMCA4b begins with a 28-residue calmodulin binding domain and continues with a downstream inhibitory region, which does not contribute to calmodulin binding (5Verma A.K. Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This downstream inhibitory region contains the sites for phosphorylation with protein kinase C. Phosphorylation of these sites releases the inhibition caused by the inhibitory region but does not affect the inhibition caused by the calmodulin binding domain. Thus, phosphorylation stimulates the pump only partially, and binding of calmodulin is needed to achieve full activity of the enzyme. Because these phosphorylation sites are located downstream of the calmodulin-binding domain, phosphorylation of hPMCA4b at these sites does not affect calmodulin binding (6Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The structure of the regulatory region of hPMCA4a, the other splice variant of isoform 4, is quite different. It has a much longer calmodulin binding domain of 49 residues, which overlaps completely with the inhibitory region. We have suggested that the long calmodulin binding sequence of hPMCA4a actually consists of two binding lobes separated by a short nonbinding region (7Verma A.K. Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3714-3718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because of this difference in the structure of the regulatory region, isoform 4a has a much lower affinity for calmodulin and a higher basal activity than isoform 4b (4Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Heim R. Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 41-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The great variability between the isoforms at the carboxyl terminus has suggested that they would have different protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, and phosphorylation at these sites would have a different effect on their activity. A recent study has shown that isoforms 2b and 3b were not phosphorylated significantly by protein kinase C, whereas isoforms 2a and 3a were phosphorylated (8Enyedi A. Elwess N.L. Filoteo A.G. Verma A.K. Paszty K. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27525-27528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of 2a and 3a with the kinase reduced calmodulin binding of these forms drastically but did not affect their basal activity. Here we show that phosphorylation of hPMCA4a with protein kinase C occurs within the calmodulin binding domain but does not affect substantially either the calmodulin affinity or the basal activity of the enzyme. Using site-directed mutagenesis we have identified a unique phosphorylation site in hPMCA4a and determined that this site lies within the folded out nonbinding region of the calmodulin binding domain. 45Ca and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Calmodulin and calmodulin-Sepharose were obtained from Sigma. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and rat brain protein kinase C (containing isoforms α, β1, β2, and γ) were purchased from Calbiochem. The specific activity of the protein kinase C preparation was 1130 units/mg protein. LipofectAMINE and Optimem media were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals used for this study were of reagent grade. 4a-ct56 and 4a-ct44 were constructed as described before (4Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Heim R. Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E.

White B.A. PCR Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 277-286Google Scholar). In this method, the first PCR product was made by amplification of an hPMCA4a sequence using a primer containing the desired mutation and a primer including a unique restriction site (KpnI) already present in the sequence. The product of this PCR was then used as a primer for a second round of PCR, with the other primer including the second unique restriction site (NsiI). The PCR products were cloned using the blunt PCR cloning kit from Invitrogen and sequenced by the Mayo Molecular Biology Core Facility. The NsiI-KpnI piece was cut out and placed into the wild-type hPMCA4a in the vector psp72. The full-length SalI-KpnI piece was then cut out of psp72 and ligated into the expression vector pMM2. Transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE based on the protocol as described by the manufacturer and by Enyedi et al. (8Enyedi A. Elwess N.L. Filoteo A.G. Verma A.K. Paszty K. Penniston J.T.

The cells were incubated at 37 °C with the DNA-LipofectAMINE complex (formed by incubating 8 μg of DNA and 100 μl of LipofectAMINE in 3.6 ml of serum-free Optimem medium) in 14.5 ml of serum-free Optimem medium. After 5 h of incubation, the cells were supplemented with serum, and incubation continued for a total of 24 h. The medium containing DNA-LipofectAMINE complex was then replaced with fresh tissue culture medium with 10% serum, and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. Crude microsomal membranes from COS cells were prepared as described by Enyedi et al. (6Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol.

Ca2+ uptake by microsomal vesicles was carried out in a 200-μl reaction mixture and assayed by rapid filtration through Millipore membrane filters (0.45 μm pore size, type HA) as described (6Enyedi A.

The reaction mixture contained 100 mm KCl, 25 mmTES-triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 40 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.2, 200 nm thapsigargin, 5 mm NaN3, 4 μg/ml oligomycin, 7 mm MgCl2, 100 μm CaCl2 (labeled with 45Ca; specific activity, 100,000–150,000 cpm/nmol), and enough EGTA to obtain 1.2 μm free Ca2+ concentration. Microsomes at a 10–20 μg/ml concentration were preincubated in the presence of the appropriate calmodulin concentration for 2 min at 37 °C, and Ca2+ uptake by the vesicles was started by the addition of 6 mm ATP. When the effect of protein kinase C on the calmodulin-activity was studied, Ca2+ uptake by the vesicles was started in the presence of 20 milliunits (0.0857 μg/ml) of PKC and 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in the absence of calmodulin. 250 nm calmodulin was added where appropriate, and the reaction was continued for an additional 5 min. The reaction was terminated by separating the microsomes with filtration through the Millipore membrane filters. 10 μg of microsomal membranes isolated from COS-1 cells transfected with the appropriate construct were phosphorylated with rat brain protein kinase C basically as described (6Enyedi A.

A 200-μl reaction mixture contained 100 mm KCl, 25 mm TES-triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 100 μm CaCl2, and 90 μm EGTA. This mixture was preincubated for 3 min with 20 milliunits (0.0875 μg/ml) of protein kinase C and 100 nmphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and the reaction was started by the addition of 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP. After 5 min of incubation the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 6% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm ATP and 10 mm inorganic phosphate. The precipitate was supplemented with 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, washed three times with the same trichloroacetic acid solution, and then dissolved in the electrophoresis sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 125 mg/ml urea, and 100 mm dithiothreitol. An aliquot of this solution containing 2 μg of membrane protein was applied to each track of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. This was done as described previously (6Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G.

Briefly, the phosphorylation reaction described above was terminated by putting the samples on ice, and subsequently, 40 μl of extraction solution containing 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 2% Triton X-100, 1.5 msucrose, 0.8 m NaCl, and 50 mmTES-triethanolamine, pH 7.2, were added. The mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min. Then, 50 μl of a suspension of calmodulin-Sepharose beads was added to each sample, and binding was allowed to proceed on ice for 90 min. The unbound proteins were removed by washing the beads four times with 200 μl of 5 × diluted extraction buffer. The proteins bound to the calmodulin-Sepharose were removed by incubating the beads with the electrophoresis sample buffer described above, which contained SDS-urea. The beads were separated from the samples by centrifugation, and an aliquot of each sample was applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The radioactive samples were electrophoresed on 4–15% gradient acrylamide gel following Laemmli's procedure (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The samples were subsequently electroblotted, and the blots were immunostained with monoclonal antibody 5F10 (10Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem.

The amount of phosphorylation was quantitated using the Bio-Rad GS-363 Molecular Imager System and related to the amount of pump protein of the same immunoblot. The amount of the constructs was determined by antibody binding using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection system and was quantitated using the Bio-Rad Molecular Imager System. We studied the phosphorylation of hPMCA4a expressed in the COS cell system with protein kinase C. To determine the region where phosphorylation occurs, we followed the same strategy as we had previously used for hPMCA4b (6Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); i.e. we used truncated mutants of hPMCA4a called 4a-ct44 and 4a-ct56 expressed in COS cells. Fig. 1 shows the sequence of the calmodulin binding domain at the carboxyl terminus of hPMCA4a, and thearrows show where the truncates end. Using these constructs, we have been able to determine the boundaries of the calmodulin binding domain and the autoinhibitory region (7Verma A.K. Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3714-3718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the membranes containing the expressed constructs was performed in the presence of protein kinase C and [γ-32P]ATP. Fig.2 A shows an immunoblot of the phosphorylated membrane samples stained with monoclonal antibody 5F10, whereas Fig. 2 B is an autoradiogram of the same immunoblot. Fig. 2 A shows that hPMCA4a and the truncates were expressed in the COS cell membrane equally well. On the autoradiogram shown in Fig. 2 B strong phosphorylated bands could be seen at the position of full-length hPMCA4a and 4a-ct44, whereas the phosphorylation was much weaker at the position of 4a-ct56.Figure 2Phosphorylation with protein kinase C of hPMCA4a and its truncated mutants, 4a-ct44 and 4a-ct56. 10 μg of microsomal membrane proteins isolated from COS cells transfected with the appropriate constructs were phosphorylated with protein kinase C as described under “Materials and Methods.” 2 μg of the samples were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted. A, 5F10 staining. B, autoradiogram of the same paper. The phosphorylation pattern seen is typical of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To analyze binding of the phosphorylated proteins to calmodulin, the samples were loaded onto calmodulin-Sepharose in the presence of calcium followed by extensive washings to remove the loosely bound proteins. The protein bound to the Sepharose beads was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (Fig.3). It is evident from Fig. 3 that all constructs bound to the calmodulin-Sepharose and that strong phosphorylation of hPMCA4a and 4a-ct44 could be seen. This experiment allowed us to see more clearly the lack of labeling of 4a-ct56. This was evident because only the pump bound to the column with high affinity, greatly improving the labeling/background ratio in the phosphorylation experiment. Because 4a-ct56 was not labeled, our data suggested that the phosphorylatable site in hPMCA4a resides between residues 1113 and 1125, within a region that is common to both hPMCA4a and 4a-ct44 but missing in 4a-ct56. The only residue that could become phosphorylated within this region is the serine at position 1115. Although this region lies within the calmodulin binding domain of hPMCA4a, phosphorylation did not affect calmodulin binding drastically;i.e. the phosphorylated samples bound to calmodulin-Sepharose. On the other hand, including excess calmodulin in the phosphorylation medium effectively inhibited the labeling of the pump (Fig. 4).Figure 4Binding of calmodulin blocked phosphorylation of hPMCA4a at serine 1115. Mutating serine 1115 to an alanine (4a S → A) or an aspartic acid (4a S→ D) diminished phosphorylation of hPMCA4a similarly to that when phosphorylation of the wild0type hPMCA4a was carried out in the presence of calmodulin (4a + CaM). Calmodulin was added to the membrane sample containing the wild-type hPMCA4a, and phosphorylation was initiated after 2 min of preincubation at 37 °C. At the same time phosphorylation of the mutants was carried out in the absence of calmodulin. The amount of phosphorylation was quantitated using the Bio-Rad Molecular Imaging System and related to the amount of expressed pump protein. The data are expressed as percent phosphorylation of the wild-type enzyme in the absence of calmodulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify that phosphorylation was indeed occurring at position 1115, this residue was modified. Fig. 4 shows that converting serine 1115 to an alanine or an aspartate in the full-length hPMCA4a blocked phosphorylation completely, in good accordance with the results obtained with the truncates. These experiments confirmed that serine 1115 is indeed a potential phosphorylation site in hPMCA4a and that this site lies within a region that is involved in calmodulin binding. Then we tested the effect of phosphorylation with protein kinase C on the Ca2+ transport activity of hPMCA4a. Microsomal membrane vesicles were preincubated with protein kinase C and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in the presence of ATP, and Ca2+uptake was initiated by the addition of labeled Ca2+. Phosphorylation did not affect either the basal or the calmodulin-stimulated activity of the enzyme (data not shown). Moreover, the activity of the mutant in which phosphorylation was mimicked by adding a fixed negative charge by replacing serine 1115 with an aspartate was equal to that of the wild type or to the mutant in which the serine was replaced by an alanine. Although phosphorylation did not abolish calmodulin binding, a shift in the calmodulin affinity would be expected because of the introduction of a negative charge within the calmodulin binding domain. Thus, we examined whether the negative charge added by phosphorylation of serine 1115 affected the calmodulin affinity of hPMCA4a. When calcium transport by membrane vesicles expressing the wild-type hPMCA4a was tested, we were unable to detect any effect of phosphorylation on the calmodulin concentration required for half-maximal stimulation of the enzyme (not shown). Because calmodulin may interfere with the phosphorylation reaction, in Fig. 5 we compared the calmodulin response curves of the mutants in which serine 1115 was replaced by an aspartate or by an alanine. These mutants mimic the totally phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the pump, respectively. No substantial shift in the calmodulin response curves of the mutants compared with that of the wild type could be detected, indicating that phosphorylation of hPMCA4a at serine 1115 does not affect the calmodulin affinity of the enzyme. Protein kinase C is a key element of intracellular signaling, which phosphorylates and regulates a wide variety of intracellular targets. Many of these targets are calmodulin-binding proteins in which phosphorylation occurs in or near the calmodulin binding domain; therefore, phosphorylation of these proteins affects (usually decreases) calmodulin binding (11Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Vasulka C. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9361-9367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Matsuoka Y. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25157-25166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It has been accepted that one of these targets is the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump and that the phosphorylation sites of the enzyme also lie near its calmodulin binding domain. The isoform diversity of this pump has caused us to ask whether the different isoforms are all regulated in the same way, or whether the regulation also shows diversity among the isoforms. Close inspection of the sequences of the isoforms has indicated that they should have different phosphorylation sites. Indeed, our recent experiments have demonstrated that among five different isoforms (rPMCA2b, rPMCA3b, hPMCA4b, rPMCA2a, and rPMCA3a) expressed in the COS cell system, only three are potential targets for protein kinase C phosphorylation (hPMCA4b, rPMCA2a, and rPMCA3a), and that phosphorylation affects their activities differently. In the case of hPMCA4b, protein kinase C partially increases the basal activity and does not affect calmodulin binding (6Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32461-32467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the cases of the other two isoforms phosphorylation does not affect the basal activity, but, rather, by diminishing calmodulin binding, it inhibits the calmodulin-stimulated activity of the enzymes (8Enyedi A. Elwess N.L. Filoteo A.G. Verma A.K. Paszty K. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27525-27528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the sequences of the regulatory regions of rPMCA2a and 3a resemble each other rather closely, the sequence of the same region of the other “a” forms is different. In the case of hPMCA4a the serine and threonine residues of this region are much less abundant than in the case of rPMCA2a and 3a, with fewer putative phosphorylation sites. The regulatory sequence and the location of the putative phosphorylation sites of hPMCA4a shows even less resemblance to hPMCA4b. In this study we demonstrated that hPMCA4a is also a potential target for protein kinase C phosphorylation. Determination of the site of phosphorylation was obtained by analyzing several carboxyl-terminally truncated mutants of hPMCA4a and by point mutation of the full-length enzyme expressed in the COS cell system. Using this strategy, we identified serine 1115 as a single phosphorylation site in the consensus sequence SFKG. The phosphorylation was blocked when calmodulin was bound to the enzyme, in good accordance with previous findings that this sequence is part of the calmodulin binding domain. Although binding of calmodulin inhibited phosphorylation, the phosphorylated pump still bound to calmodulin-Sepharose and was activated by calmodulin. Moreover, the mutant in which phosphorylation was mimicked by converting serine 1115 to an aspartic acid also was activated by calmodulin. We were unable to detect an effect by introducing a negative charge either by phosphorylation or by mutation on the concentration of calmodulin required for half-maximal activation of hPMCA4a. These results show that serine 1115 is not involved directly in calmodulin binding but is hidden from protein kinase C phosphorylation when calmodulin is bound before phosphorylation. Recently, we have suggested that the calmodulin binding domain of hPMCA4a consists of two separate binding regions, which are interrupted by a short nonbinding loop (7Verma A.K. Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3714-3718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The present findings support this idea and indicate that serine 1115 is part of the loop that is folded out of the calmodulin-enzyme interaction surface. Thus, the nonbinding loop may start with the aspartic acid at position 1105 and end with the sequence surrounding serine 1115, as shown in Fig.6. Phosphorylation of hPMCA4b at its downstream inhibitory region caused partial activation of the enzyme. On the contrary, phosphorylation of hPMCA4a within its calmodulin binding domain (which also serves as an inhibitor) did not affect the basal activity. This suggests that the loop that is folded out from the calmodulin-enzyme interaction is not in contact with the catalytic core of the pump and therefore is not involved in self-inhibition. In conclusion, here we have provided additional evidence for the differential regulation of the plasma membrane calcium pump isoforms with protein kinase C. It is clear that each isoform has a unique mode of regulation by protein kinase C phosphorylation, which is presumably suited to its function in the cell. Of the six isoforms studied so far, four (4b, 4a, 3a, and 2a) are phosphorylated by protein kinase C, but only one (4b) is activated by this phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of 2a and 3a prevented calmodulin binding, whereas phosphorylation of 4a and 4b had little effect on calmodulin binding. The relationship of these properties to the functions of these isoforms in the living cell remains to be determined. All of these findings are based on studies using the overexpressed pump isoforms in COS cell membranes. We cannot exclude the possibility that in other kinds of membranes unknown factors may modify the locus and the effect of protein kinase C phosphorylation, but this is the only system currently available for studying the characteristics of the individual pump isoforms."

Plants are sessile organisms that have evolved a wide spectrum of mechanisms to adapt to changes in their natural environment. Light is used not only as the energy source for photosynthesis, but also as a major environmental signal. To monitor changes in light quality and quantity and to regulate temporal and spatial patterns in photomorphogenesis, plants have evolved at least three different photoreceptor systems: UVB photoreceptors, blue UVA photoreceptors, and phytochromes (1$$Google Scholar). Of these photoreceptors, the phytochromes are the best characterized. Five genes encoding phytochrome apoproteins have been identified in Arabidopsis (2Sharrock R.A. Quail P.H. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1745-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 3Clack T. Mathews S. Sharrock R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar).

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The dominant phytochrome of etiolated seedlings, the light-labile phyA, controls the very low fluence and the high irradiance responses, whereas the dominant phytochrome of green seedlings and mature plants, the light-stable phyB, controls responses governed by red/far-red reversibility or continuous red light (9Furuya M. Schäfer E. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 301-307Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).Phytochromes are dimers composed of 120-kDa monomers, each of which contains two domains linked by a highly conserved hinge region. The N-terminal domain bears the chromophore, and the C-terminal domain is involved in dimerization (Fig.1 A) (10Furuya M. Song P.-S. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 105-140Crossref Google Scholar). Phytochromes are synthesized in the dark in their physiologically inactive red light-absorbing form (Pr). Upon photon absorption, Pr is converted into the physiologically active far-red light-absorbing form of phytochrome (Pfr). During this reversible process, the absorption maximum of the molecule shifts from 660 nm (red light) to 730 nm (far-red light). Under saturating red light, 80% or more of the phytochrome is in the Pfr form, whereas only 3% Pfr remains following exposure to saturating far-red light (11Mancinelli A.L. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 211-269Crossref Google Scholar). In vivo spectroscopy has demonstrated that phyA undergoes dark reversion in most dicotyledonous seedlings, but not in monocotyledonous seedlings (11Mancinelli A.L. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 211-269Crossref Google Scholar). Hence, some of the Pfr in dicotyledonous seedlings is converted to the physiologically inactive Pr form in total darkness.Rapid de novo synthesis of phyA in darkness, rapid degradation of the Pfr form (half-life of 30–60 min) in light, rapid dark reversion of 20% of the Pfr molecules to Pr (half-life of 20 min) in most dicotyledonous seedlings, and light-dependent rapid aggregation (half-life of 2 s) of the protein into SAPs have been demonstrated by in vivo spectroscopy and immunological methods (1$$Google Scholar). Ubiquitin may be involved in this degradation process, which is associated with the formation of SAPs (12Vierstra R.D. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 141-162Crossref Google Scholar). In vivocharacterization of phytochromes has been possible only for phyA because the less abundant phyB cannot be spectroscopically distinguished from the abundant phyA, and high levels of chlorophyll prevent measurement of phyB even if phyA is destroyed in the light. Even in mutants lacking phyA, phyB is difficult to detect because of its low concentration. In vivo spectroscopic studies of phytochrome have been performed in light-grown bleached seedlings of certain species; the results of these studies may reflect properties of phyB (13Jabben M. Holmes M.G. Shropshire W. Mohr H. Photomorphogenesis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1983: 704-722Crossref Google Scholar, 14Heim B. Jabben M. Schäfer E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1981; 34: 89-93Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These studies indicate a very slow destruction of the light-stable phytochrome (half-life of >8 h) and a weak partial dark reversion.A model system for spectroscopic and immunological characterization of phyB has been developed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (15Kunkel T. Speth V. Büche C. Schäfer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20193-20200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The yeast-derived phytochrome-chromophore adducts are functionalin planta (16Kunkel T. Neuhaus G. Batschauer A. Chua N.-H. Schäfer E. Plant J. 1996; 10: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and tobacco PHYB* is stable, shows a partial rapid dark reversion from Pfr to Pr, and does not form SAPs. In contrast, rice PHYA* expressed in yeast does not undergo dark reversion, but does exhibit SAPs as well as light-independent formation of SAP-like structures (15Kunkel T. Speth V. Büche C. Schäfer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20193-20200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, phytochromes expressed in yeast appear to exhibit most of the properties demonstrated in planta.The effects of modified and overexpressed phytochromes in transgenic plants have helped define the structure and function of phyA and phyB. The 4–6-kDa N terminus of phyA is important for photoreceptor function. Deletion of this region results in a dominant-negative phenotype in overexpressing lines (17Boylan M. Douglas N. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Emmler K. Stockhaus J. Chua N.-H. Schäfer E.

From these studies, it was concluded that the N-terminal domains determine photosensory specificity and light lability (19Wagner D. Fairchild C.D. Kuhn R.M. Quail P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4011-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Quail P.H. Boylan M.T. Parks B.M. Short T.W. Xu Y. Wagner D. Science. 1995; 268: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar).In this study, we describe the expression and assembly of PHYA, PHYB, and various chimeric apoproteins in yeast and the spectroscopic properties of the phytochrome adducts and their capacity to form SAP-like structures. Our aim was to elucidate the molecular substructures of phytochrome important for SAP formation and dark reversion, both of which appear to be essential in regulating signal transduction.DISCUSSIONWe investigated which domains of the phytochrome molecule are responsible for dark reversion and SAP formation. For this investigation, rice PHYA, tobacco PHYB, and various chimeric phytochrome apoproteins were expressed in yeast and reconstitutedin vivo with PCB as the chromophore to enable in vivo spectroscopic examinations. Table II summarizes the results.Rice PHYA* showed no dark reversion, but showed light-independent SAP-like formation. The opposite was true for tobacco PHYB* (see also Ref. 15Kunkel T. Speth V. Büche C. Schäfer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20193-20200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Wagner et al. (19Wagner D. Fairchild C.D. Kuhn R.M. Quail P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4011-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) demonstrated, by domain swap experiments in transgenic wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings, that the chromophore-bearing N-terminal domains of phyA and phyB determine the photosensory specificity and different light lability of the phytochromes. These authors used oat PHYAand rice PHYB to clone chimera for their analysis. We used a yeast expression system and rice PHYA and tobaccoPHYB for our constructs. To obtain more information about the role of the N-terminal domain, we constructed chimeric PHYAB and PHYBA by swapping the 60-kDa domains, and two additional chimera (PHYTBRA and PHYPARA) were constructed by fusing either the 10.5-kDa N terminus of tobacco PHYB or the 9-kDa N terminus of parsley PHYA, respectively, to the truncated part of rice PHYA (Fig.1 A).Photoreversible phytochromes were obtained with all constructs, which was a prerequisite for all subsequent analyses. Interestingly, all of the PHYA* chimeras with a replaced N terminus (PHYBA*, PHYTBRA*, and PHYPARA*) showed a slightly hypsochromic shift of the far-red absorption maxima compared with PHYA* (Fig. 2).A characteristic difference between phyA and phyB is the light-dependent SAP formation of phyA in plantaand the light-independent SAP-like formation of PHYA in yeast. Light-induced SAP formation of phyA has been observed in etiolated monocotyledonous and some dicotyledonous seedlings (33Pratt L.H. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 163-185Crossref Google Scholar). As SAP formation and pelletability (34Hofmann E. Grimm R. Harter K. Speth V. Schäfer E. Planta (Heidelb.). 1991; 183: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) show parallel kinetics, temperature dependence, and light dependence, it was concluded that these two observations reflect the same process. Therefore, SAP formation is considered as a molecular property of phyA. Although SAP formation of PHYA* and PHYA has also been found in yeast cells, it could not be obtained for PHYB* and PHYB (15Kunkel T. Speth V. Büche C. Schäfer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20193-20200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared SAP-like formation of PHYAB and PHYBA chimeric phytochromes in yeast cells.The chimeric phytochromes PHYAB and PHYBA both showed SAP-like formation. This might be explained by the fact that the N-terminal half and the C-terminal half of PHYA are each sufficient to allow SAP formation when the domains are fused to the corresponding domains of PHYB. It is possible that the surfaces of the chimeric phytochrome molecules became hydrophobic in order to aggregate more simply in a cytosolic environment. phyB is not prone to aggregate because it is possibly more hydrophilic than phyA; the addition of a hydrophobic part causes it to sequester.Wagner et al. (19Wagner D. Fairchild C.D. Kuhn R.M. Quail P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4011-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) demonstrated that phyAB shows a similar destruction as phyA and that phyBA, like phyB, shows almost no destruction. The sequestering of PHYA in yeast is light-independent (15Kunkel T. Speth V. Büche C. Schäfer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20193-20200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and this was also the case with PHYBA in our experiments, although no destruction occurred in planta (19Wagner D. Fairchild C.D. Kuhn R.M. Quail P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4011-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, SAP formation might be necessary, but not sufficient, for destruction (12Vierstra R.D. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 141-162Crossref Google Scholar, 35Speth V. Otto V. Schäfer E. Planta (Heidelb.). 1987; 171: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because of the fact that PHYBA* is stable in yeast (Fig.4 D), a specific destruction pathway like that in plants does not exist in yeast.Spectroscopic examinations of dark reversion in vivorevealed that 20% of PHYA* decayed (Fig. 4 A, dashed line), whereas Ptot for all other constructs was stable (Fig. 4, B–F, dashed lines). There was no dark reversion of PHYA*. Kunkel et al. (15Kunkel T. Speth V. Büche C. Schäfer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20193-20200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) did not observe this instability of PHYA* because their measurements were performed at 4 °C, whereas we performed our analysis at 20 °C. This difference in temperature is a sufficient explanation of this result. The amount and rate of phytochrome dark reversion in yeast were independent of temperature (compare Fig. 4, A and B, with Ref.15Kunkel T. Speth V. Büche C. Schäfer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20193-20200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar; data not shown for Fig. 4, C–F). In contrast to this, phyA dark reversion is strongly temperature-dependentin planta (36Schäfer E. Schmidt W. Planta (Heidelb.). 1974; 116: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), indicating that this process is not a simple thermal instability of Pfr, but a catalyzed process in planta.In most etiolated dicotyledonous seedlings, a small fraction of Pfr (∼20%) undergoes dark reversion into Pr as detected by in vivo spectroscopy (36Schäfer E. Schmidt W. Planta (Heidelb.). 1974; 116: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Marmé D. Marchal B. Schäfer E. Planta (Heidelb.). 1971; 100: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas in etiolated grasses, no dark reversion of Pfr can be detected in vivo (38Schäfer E. Lassig T.-U. Schopfer P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1975; 22: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). phyA was probably measured in these studies because etiolated plant material was used (see the Introduction). Recently, Kunkel et al. (15Kunkel T. Speth V. Büche C. Schäfer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20193-20200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) demonstrated dark reversion for reconstituted tobacco PHYB* in yeast.In vitro dark reversion of extracts of potato PHYA* and PHYB* expressed in yeast was shown by Ruddat et al. (39Ruddat A. Schmidt P. Gatz C. Braslavsky S.E. Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).In vitro dark reversion of oat phyA is detectable only for the so-called large phytochrome, which lacks the 4–6-kDa N-terminal fragment (40Pratt L.H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 27: 81-105Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Rice PHYA* did not show any dark reversion. The dark reversion rates of PHYA constructs with an N-terminal replacement (PHYBA*, PHYTBRA*, and PHYPARA*) were three times faster and involved a greater proportion of Pfr molecules than the dark reversion rate of PHYB* (Fig. 4,D–F). Consequently, these molecules are less stable in their physiological Pfr form, which is consistent with the previous observation that the N terminus is very important for the stability of the Pfr form of phytochrome (40Pratt L.H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 27: 81-105Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We conclude that, among other factors, the very N-terminal part of the monocotyledonous phyA is necessary, but not sufficient, for the prevention of dark reversion. The prevention of dark reversion stabilizes the Pfr form of phytochrome and plays an important role in the regulation of signal transduction. This mechanism in signal transduction of phyA in monocotyledonous plants would only be attenuated by destruction of the phyA molecule.The chimeric adducts PHYAB* and PHYBA* both exhibited dark reversion, which indicates that a special domain of phyB does not mediate dark reversion. PHYAB* showed dark reversion comparable to PHYB* and weaker than the three N terminus-swapped phytochromes (PHYBA*, PHYTBRA*, and PHYPARA*). Thus, the C terminus of phyA has a minor, but necessary, role in the prevention of dark reversion, whereas the N terminus has a major, but not sufficient, role in the prevention of dark reversion. Therefore, the very N terminus (9 kDa) and the C-terminal half of phyA are both needed to hinder dark reversion. For most phyA and phyB phytochromes, dark reversion seems to be a crucial down-regulator of signal transduction because the half-life of ∼20 min is much faster than the competing destruction. The attenuation of the signal transduction of phyA in monocotyledonous and some dicotyledonous plants (e.g. Amaranthus) is obviously due to the destruction with a half-life of ∼30 min, rather than due to dark reversion (41Kendrick R.E. Hillman W.S. Am. J. Bot. 1971; 58: 424-428Google Scholar). Destruction probably replaces dark reversion as a switching-off mechanism of signal transduction. However, in all other cases, dark reversion seems to be an intrinsic molecular property of phytochromes per se and was even measured inSynechocystis phytochrome (42Yeh K.-C. Wu S.-H. Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1505-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).We advance the hypothesis that there exists a mechanism in phytochrome that prevents dark reversion, rather than the existence of a mechanism that promotes dark reversion. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that changes in the molecular structure of phytochrome result in a partial instability of Pfr, which leads to enhanced and accelerated dark reversion.If this interpretation holds, it would also have to be taken into account for interpretations of phyA and phyB signaling mutants. The missense mutations in both phyA and phyB in Arabidopsis are all clustered in a region in the C-terminal part of phytochrome (43Xu Y. Parks B.M. Short T.W. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,44Wagner D. Quail P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8596-8600Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); they lead to a loss of function without, however, changing the expression level of the photoreceptors. Therefore, this domain has been described as a signaling box (Fig. 1 A). However, alterations of the extent and the velocity of dark reversion may be caused by mutations in this region, thus leading to a non-signaling mutation.Recently, Elich and Chory (45Elich T.D. Chory J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2271-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) analyzed one of these mutations (phyB-101, a Glu-to-Lys change at amino acid 812) and, after expression of this mutated phytochrome in yeast and assembly with the chromophorein vitro, showed a 3-fold faster dark reversion with three to four times more dark-reverting Pfr obtained compared with wild-type phyB. Thus, the interpretation of these “signaling” mutants necessitates a careful in vivo spectroscopic and physiological study.The data presented here and by Elich and Chory (45Elich T.D. Chory J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2271-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) show that the amount and velocity of dark reversion may be altered by mutations or domain swapping. Based on the observations that the dark reversion of the Pfr/Pr heterodimer is faster than destruction and that only a small percentage of the Pfr molecules undergo dark reversion, Brockmannet al. (46Brockmann J. Rieble S. Kazarinova-Fukshansky N. Seyfried M. Schäfer E. Plant Cell Environ. 1987; 10: 105-111Google Scholar) hypothesized that dark reversion is only possible starting from the Pfr/Pr heterodimer state. After a light pulse shifts a phytochrome system to a 50% photoequilibrium, only 50% of the molecules can convert into the heterodimer state. This is the maximum of heterodimers in the phytochrome system. As only half of these molecules undergo dark reversion, there are only 25% of the Pfr molecules left to show such a reversion. After a saturating light pulse, the system arrives at a photoequilibrium of 80–86%. Hence, 24–32% of heterodimers exist, so 12–18% of the Pfr molecules should show dark reversion. However, as demonstrated in Fig. 4, PHYB* and PHYAB* exhibited a dark reversion of 30%, and PHYBA*, PHYTBRA*, and PHYPARA* showed a dark reversion of 40–50%. Thus, the heterodimer hypothesis is not true in this context, and dark reversion must consequently also be possible from the Pfr/Pfr homodimer state.Our data show that dark reversion is a crucial mechanism to attenuate signal transduction and that this differs for phyA and phyB. Therefore, the dynamics of the phytochrome molecule, especially dark reversion, must be considered in the analysis of the first steps in the signal transduction chain of phytochrome-dependent photomorphogenesis. Plants are sessile organisms that have evolved a wide spectrum of mechanisms to adapt to changes in their natural environment. Light is used not only as the energy source for photosynthesis, but also as a major environmental signal. To monitor changes in light quality and quantity and to regulate temporal and spatial patterns in photomorphogenesis, plants have evolved at least three different photoreceptor systems: UVB photoreceptors, blue UVA photoreceptors, and phytochromes (1$$Google Scholar). Of these photoreceptors, the phytochromes are the best characterized. Five genes encoding phytochrome apoproteins have been identified in Arabidopsis (2Sharrock R.A. Quail P.H. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1745-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 3Clack T. Mathews S. Sharrock R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Mutants of phyA,1 phyB, and phytochrome D in Arabidopsis have different effects on photomorphogenesis (4Nagatani A. Reed J.W. Chory J. Plant Physiol.

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The dominant phytochrome of etiolated seedlings, the light-labile phyA, controls the very low fluence and the high irradiance responses, whereas the dominant phytochrome of green seedlings and mature plants, the light-stable phyB, controls responses governed by red/far-red reversibility or continuous red light (9Furuya M. Schäfer E. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 301-307Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Phytochromes are dimers composed of 120-kDa monomers, each of which contains two domains linked by a highly conserved hinge region. The N-terminal domain bears the chromophore, and the C-terminal domain is involved in dimerization (Fig.1 A) (10Furuya M. Song P.-S. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 105-140Crossref Google Scholar). Phytochromes are synthesized in the dark in their physiologically inactive red light-absorbing form (Pr). Upon photon absorption, Pr is converted into the physiologically active far-red light-absorbing form of phytochrome (Pfr). During this reversible process, the absorption maximum of the molecule shifts from 660 nm (red light) to 730 nm (far-red light). Under saturating red light, 80% or more of the phytochrome is in the Pfr form, whereas only 3% Pfr remains following exposure to saturating far-red light (11Mancinelli A.L. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 211-269Crossref Google Scholar). In vivo spectroscopy has demonstrated that phyA undergoes dark reversion in most dicotyledonous seedlings, but not in monocotyledonous seedlings (11Mancinelli A.L. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 211-269Crossref Google Scholar). Hence, some of the Pfr in dicotyledonous seedlings is converted to the physiologically inactive Pr form in total darkness. Rapid de novo synthesis of phyA in darkness, rapid degradation of the Pfr form (half-life of 30–60 min) in light, rapid dark reversion of 20% of the Pfr molecules to Pr (half-life of 20 min) in most dicotyledonous seedlings, and light-dependent rapid aggregation (half-life of 2 s) of the protein into SAPs have been demonstrated by in vivo spectroscopy and immunological methods (1$$Google Scholar). Ubiquitin may be involved in this degradation process, which is associated with the formation of SAPs (12Vierstra R.D. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 141-162Crossref Google Scholar). In vivocharacterization of phytochromes has been possible only for phyA because the less abundant phyB cannot be spectroscopically distinguished from the abundant phyA, and high levels of chlorophyll prevent measurement of phyB even if phyA is destroyed in the light. Even in mutants lacking phyA, phyB is difficult to detect because of its low concentration. In vivo spectroscopic studies of phytochrome have been performed in light-grown bleached seedlings of certain species; the results of these studies may reflect properties of phyB (13Jabben M. Holmes M.G. Shropshire W. Mohr H. Photomorphogenesis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1983: 704-722Crossref Google Scholar, 14Heim B. Jabben M. Schäfer E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1981; 34: 89-93Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These studies indicate a very slow destruction of the light-stable phytochrome (half-life of >8 h) and a weak partial dark reversion. A model system for spectroscopic and immunological characterization of phyB has been developed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (15Kunkel T. Speth V. Büche C. Schäfer E. J"
https://openalex.org/W1971909540,"Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is known to sensitize platelets to agonists via integrin mediated outside-in signaling (Hackeng, C. M., Huigsloot, M., Pladet, M. W., Nieuwenhuis, H. K., Rijn, H. J. M. v., and Akkerman, J. W. N. (1999) Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., in press). As outside in signaling is associated with phosphorylation of p125FAK, the effect of LDL on p125FAK phosphorylation in platelets was investigated. LDL induced p125FAK phosphorylation in a dose- and time- dependent manner. The phosphorylation was independent of ligand binding to integrin αIIbβ3 and aggregation, such in contrast to α-thrombin-induced p125FAK phosphorylation, that critically depended on platelet aggregation. Platelets from patients with Glanzmann's thrombastenia showed the same LDL- induced phos- phorylation of p125FAK as control platelets, whereas α-thrombin completely failed to phosphorylate the kinase in the patients platelets. LDL signaling to p125FAK was independent of integrin α2β1, the FcγRII receptor, and the lysophosphatidic acid receptor and not affected by inhibitors of cyclooxygenase, protein kinase C, ERK1/2 or p38MAPK. Phosphorylation of p125FAK by LDL was strongly inhibited by cyclic AMP. These observations indicate that LDL is a unique platelet agonist, as it phosphorylates p125FAKin platelet suspensions, under unstirred conditions and independent of integrin αIIbβ3. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is known to sensitize platelets to agonists via integrin mediated outside-in signaling (Hackeng, C. M., Huigsloot, M., Pladet, M. W., Nieuwenhuis, H. K., Rijn, H. J.

Focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase implicated in signaling pathways mediated by integrins, G-protein coupled receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors, and the v-Src and v-Crk oncoproteins (1Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). After cell activation, p125FAKtranslocates to the cytoskeleton at focal adhesions (2Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A.

The protein contains six tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Autophosphorylation of Tyr397 generates a high affinity binding site for the SH2 domain of Src family kinases. The association of Src subsequently initiates phosphorylation of Tyr407,576,577, inducing maximal kinase activity of p125FAK (7Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Association of Src also leads to the phosphorylation of Tyr925, thereby creating a docking site for the adaptor protein Grb2 that is known to mediate Ras activation by binding of the GDP/GTP exchange factor Sos, linking p125FAK to the Ras/MAP kinase pathway (8Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). The relevance of phosphorylation on Tyr861 is not entirely clear, but it could serve as another site of p125FAKinteraction with Src-family kinases. Phosphorylation of p125FAK in blood platelets is different for platelets in suspension and platelets adherent to immobilized ligand. In platelet suspensions, p125FAK phosphorylation only occurred under aggregating conditions (9Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). An antibody against integrin αIIbβ3, that blocked fibrinogen binding and aggregation, totally abolished p125FAKphosphorylation by α-thrombin and collagen in stirred suspensions. In the absence of stirring, α-thrombin (9Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) failed to induce p125FAK-phosphorylation. The role for αIIbβ3 in this signaling event was further supported by platelets from patients with Glanzmann's thrombastenia, that lack αIIbβ3, in which neither α-thrombin nor collagen induced p125FAK phosphorylation in stirred suspensions (9Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Platelets adherent to immobilized ligand show αIIbβ3-dependent and -independent p125FAK phosphorylation. Platelets bound to fibrinogen show p125FAK phosphorylation via αIIbβ3. Platelets from a patient with a truncated cytoplasmic domain of the β3-subunit (11Wang R. Shattil S.J. Ambruso D.R. Newman P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2393-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with truncated forms of the β3-subunit (12Leong L. Hughes P.E. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3817-3825PubMed Google Scholar) bound to immobilized fibrinogen but failed to induce phosphorylation of p125FAK. Expression of a constitutively active mutant of β3 together with αIIb led to a slight degree of p125FAKphosphorylation in suspended Chinese hamster ovary cells in the presence of fibrinogen. However, this phosphorylation was negligible compared with the same cells adherent to fibrinogen (13Lyman S. Gilmore A. Burridge K. Gidwitz S. White II, G.C. J. Biol.

Hence, in platelets p125FAK may play a central role in signal transduction after αIIbβ3ligation or in platelet adhesion, thereby strengthening ligand- receptor interaction and coordinating further signaling.

The faster collagen-induced secretion in LDL-treated platelets critically depends on ligand-induced outside-in signaling via integrin αIIbβ3. This is illustrated in αIIbβ3-deficient platelets, where pretreatment with LDL failed to increase dense granule secretion in response to collagen (22Hackeng C.M. Huigsloot M. Pladet M.W.

Fresh, nonfrozen plasma from four healthy subjects each containing less than 100 mg lipoprotein(a)/liter was pooled, and LDL (density range 1.019–1.063 kg/liter) was isolated by sequential flotation in a Beckman L-70 ultracentrifuge (26Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6479) Google Scholar). To prevent lipid modification and bacterial contamination, 0.25 mm PMSF, 0.2 mm thimerosal, 2 mmNaN3, and 4 mm EDTA (final concentrations) were present during the first run (20 h, 175,000 × g, 10 °C). Subsequent centrifugations (20 h, 175,000 ×g, 10 °C) were carried out in the absence of additives except for NaN3 and EDTA. LDL was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore, Molsheim, France) and subsequently dialyzed against 103 volumes of 150 mm NaCl containing 1.5 mm NaN3 and 1 mmEDTA. LDL was stored at 4 °C under nitrogen for not longer than 14 days and before each experiment dialyzed overnight against 104 volumes 150 mm NaCl. ApoB100 and lipoprotein(a) concentrations were measured using the Behring Nephelometer 100. As described previously (22Hackeng C.M. Huigsloot M. Pladet M.W. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Rijn H.J.M.v. Akkerman J.W.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), these LDL preparations contained only minimal amounts of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (0.20 ± 0.07 nmol/mg) and lipid peroxides (6.7 ± 1.9 nmol/mg). The concentrations of these oxidation markers were below or within other reported values for native LDL (27Ardlie N.G. Selley M.L. Simons L.A.

LDL preparations were analyzed for possible contamination by fibrinogen (Laurell technique), fibronectin (ELISA) or von Willebrand Factor (ELISA); all concentrations were below detection limits, which were <50 μg fibrinogen, <50 ng fibronectin, and < 5 ng von Willebrand Factor per g of B100 protein. The concentration of LDL was expressed as gram of apoB100 protein/liter. Freshly drawn venous blood from healthy volunteers was collected with informed consent into 0.1 volume of 130 mm trisodium citrate. The donors claimed not to have taken any medication during 2 weeks prior to blood collection. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation (200 × g for 15 min at 22 °C). Gel-filtered platelets were isolated by gel filtration through Sepharose 2B equilibrated in Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 1.7 mmMgCl2, and 11.9 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.25) containing 0.2% BSA and 5 mm glucose. Platelets were adjusted to a final count of 2 × 1011/liter. Platelets (108 cells) were incubated with LDL or α-thrombin as indicated under “Results” and thereafter mixed with ice-cold lysis buffer (1:10 v/v) containing 10% Nonidet P-40, 5% N-octyl glucoside, 10 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm PMSF, 200 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 mm benzamidine in Tyrode's solution. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were precipitated using 1 μg of 4G10 and protein A-Sepharose (100 μl of a 1% suspension of protein A-Sepharose in lysis buffer, previously blocked in 1% BSA, 1 h, 22 °C) for 5 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and taken up in sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylated p125FAK was visualized by incubation with anti-p125FAK mAb (0.25 μg/ml, 15 h, 4 °C), peroxidase-linked rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 v/v, 1 h, 4 °C), and enhanced chemiluminescence. In some experiments, as indicated, samples (2 × 108cells) were split in two equal aliquots and precipitated with polyclonal anti-p125FAK (1.5 μg) under the same conditions. Phosphorylated p125FAK was visualized using 4G10 (0.5 μg/ml) and total p125FAK using anti-p125FAK mAb. For semiquantitative determination of p125FAK, the density of the bands was analyzed using Image Quant software. Four unrelated patients with Glanzmann's thrombastenia (MAV, CPW, LYON1, and LYON2) were studied. The diagnosis was made on the basis of a markedly prolonged bleeding time (Simplate, >30 min; normal, <8 min) and a severe reduction in platelet αIIbβ3. Patients MAV and CPW have been described previously (22Hackeng C.M. Huigsloot M. Pladet M.W. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Rijn H.J.M.v. Akkerman J.W.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). On a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, 0.3% and 0.4% αIIbβ3-positive platelets were detected, respectively. Platelets from patients LYON1 and LYON2 (32Negrier C. Vinciguerra C. Attali O. Grenier C. Larcher M.E. Dechavanne M. Br. J. Haematol. 1998; 100: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were obtained with the kind assistance of Dr. Claude Negrier, Hospital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France. Fig.1 illustrates that LDL induced a dose-dependent increase in phosphotyrosine content of p125FAK, in unstirred platelet suspensions. When precipitation was performed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by SDS-PAGE, significant p125FAK phosphorylation was observed at an LDL concentration of 0.5 g/liter apoB100 (Fig. 1,A and B). Inversely, when precipitation was performed with an anti-p125FAK antibody, and blots were probed for phosphotyrosine containing proteins, similar results were obtained (Fig. 1 C). Samples from Fig. 1 C revealed equal amounts of p125FAK protein in each lane when the blot was probed with anti-p125FAK (Fig. 1 D). A rise in phosphorylation of p125FAK after LDL incubation was observed as soon as 10 s after addition of LDL; activation was maximal at about 2 min. This maximum was sustained until 30 min (Fig.2, A and B) and did not decline until 90 min after stimulation (not shown). P125FAKphosphorylation in platelet suspensions stimulated with α-thrombin and collagen is known to depend on ligand binding to integrin αIIbβ3 and aggregation (9Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 10Huang M.M. Lipfert L. Cunningham M. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 33Shattil S.J. Haimovich B. Cunningham M. Lipfert L. Parsons J.T. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14738-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In concert with these reports, α-thrombin (1 unit/ml) failed to induce p125FAK phosphorylation in unstirred platelet suspensions, where aggregation was absent (Fig.3 A). Under these conditions, prevention of fibrinogen binding to integrin αIIbβ3 by the fibrinogen γ-chain-derived dodecapeptide (γ400–411) (34Shattil S.J. Jamieson G.A. Platelet Membrane Receptors: Molecular Biology, Immunology, Biochemistry and Pathology. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 345-380Google Scholar) did not have any effect. Under stirred conditions, α-thrombin induced a strong phosphorylation of p125FAK. The phosphorylation was completely abolished by γ400–411, which inhibits αIIbβ3 occupancy by fibrinogen that is released by α-thrombin-stimulated platelets, which is in agreement with an earlier report (9Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Again, LDL induced p125FAKphosphorylation in the absence (Fig. 3) and presence (not shown) of stirring. Surprisingly, p125FAK phosphorylation by LDL was insensitive to the presence of γ400–411 (Fig.3 A), although under these conditions LDL induced a slight but significant α-granule secretion (5–10% P-selectin (CD62P) expression compared with 20 μm thrombin receptor activating peptide (SFLLRN)) (22Hackeng C.M. Huigsloot M. Pladet M.W. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Rijn H.J.M.v. Akkerman J.W.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, LDL induced p125FAK phosphorylation independent of ligand binding to integrin αIIbβ3 and aggregation. To investigate whether the phosphorylation of p125FAK by LDL involved ligand-independent signaling via αIIbβ3, or completely bypassed the integrin, the experiments were repeated with platelets from patients with Glanzmann's thrombastenia that are deficient in αIIbβ3. Fig. 3 B shows the phosphorylation of p125FAK by LDL in the absence and presence of γ400–411 in Glanzmann's platelets, which was the same as seen in normal subjects. In stirred suspensions of Glanzmann's platelets, α-thrombin completely failed to induce p125FAK phosphorylation, both in the absence or presence of γ400–411. From these experiments we conclude that LDL is a unique platelet agonist, as it initiates phosphorylation of p125FAK in unstirred platelet suspensions, independent of integrin αIIbβ3. To investigate whether LDL-induced p125FAK phosphorylation involved the same signaling mechanisms as seen in surface-activated platelets, incubations were performed with agents that interfere with signal processing at the level of surface receptors (Fig.4 A) or intracellular signaling routes (Fig. 4 B). As already shown in Fig. 3 A, γ400–411 did not affect p125FAKphosphorylation. Earlier work has shown that collagen-induced p125FAK phosphorylation was mediated by integrin α2β1 and was inhibited by the antibody 6F1 against this integrin (16Polanowska-Grabowska R. Geanacopoulos M. Gear A.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). p125FAK phosphorylation by immobilized IgG was inhibited by anti FcγRII antibody IV-3 (15Haimovich B. Regan C. DiFazio L. Ginalis E. Ji P. Purohit U. Rowley R.B. Bolen J. Greco R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16332-16337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). None of these antibodies affected LDL-induced p125FAKphosphorylation. Also inhibition of thromboxane A2(TxA2)-formation by indomethacin had no effect. As it was reported that p125FAK phosphorylation is regulated via PKC in platelets adherent to immobilized fibrinogen (35Haimovich B. Kaneshiki N. Ji P. Blood. 1996; 87: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or collagen (15Haimovich B. Regan C. DiFazio L. Ginalis E. Ji P. Purohit U. Rowley R.B. Bolen J. Greco R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16332-16337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the studies were repeated in the presence of the PKC inhibitor GF109203X, but p125FAK phosphorylation remained the same. Also the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2 (p44/42MAPK) has been implicated in integrin-mediated signaling (36Li S. Kim M. Hu Y.L. Jalali S. Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30455-30462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 37Lin T.H. Aplin A.E. Shen Y. Chen Q. Schaller M. Romer L. Aukhil I. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the effect of the inhibitor PD98059 of MEK, the upstream activator of ERK1/2. The stress-activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) has been implicated in actin reorganization and cell migration in endothelial cells, both processes that are accompanied by focal adhesion formation (38Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Inhibition of p38MAPK was achieved using SB203580 (39Saklatvala J. Rawlinson L. Waller R.J. Sarsfield S. Lee J.C. Morton L.F. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6586-6589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Both inhibitors did not change LDL-induced p125FAKphosphorylation. In contrast, a strong inhibition was observed in the presence of agents that increase cyclic AMP (cAMP). PGI2(prostacyclin), its stable analogue iloprost and the cell-permeable cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) all strongly decreased p125FAK phosphorylation induced by LDL. Taken together, these data show that LDL-induced phosphorylation of p125FAK occurred upstream of or independent from signal transduction through TxA2 formation, PKC, ERK1/2, and p38MAPK. However, the strong inhibition by agents that raise cAMP reflects negative regulation by cAMP-dependent processes. Previous studies have shown that LPA induces phosphorylation of p125FAK in Swiss 3T3 cells (40Wang F. Nobes C.D. Hall A. Spiegel S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and rat hepatoma cells (41Imamura F. Shinkai K. Mukai M. Yoshioka K. Komagome R. Iwasaki T. Akedo H. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 65: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As activated platelets release LPA in vitro (42Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and possibly in vivo, we investigated whether the activating properties of LDL were caused by contamination with LPA. In a concentration that induces cell activation (1 μmol/liter, Ref. 43Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Mulder S. Postma F.R. Simon M.F. Chap H. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and 10-fold higher, LPA did not initiate the phosphorylation of p125FAK. The present findings show that LDL triggers the phosphorylation of p125FAK in platelet suspensions independent of integrin αIIbβ3 and aggregation. This is in sharp contrast to phosphorylation by α-thrombin, collagen, and costimulation of epinephrine with ADP (9Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) or LIBS6 Fab fragments (33Shattil S.J. Haimovich B. Cunningham M. Lipfert L. Parsons J.T. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14738-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in cell suspension, which requires ligand binding to αIIbβ3 and platelet-platelet contact. The requirement for ligand-induced outside-in signaling is illustrated by the absence of p125FAK phosphorylation under conditions that prevent platelet spreading (10Huang M.M. Lipfert L. Cunningham M. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11Wang R. Shattil S.J. Ambruso D.R. Newman P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2393-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 5Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LDL induces p125FAK phosphorylation within seconds after stimulation, reaching a maximum at physiological concentrations of LDL (0.26–1.23 g of apoB100/liter) (44Jacobs D.S. Laboratory Test Handbook. Lexi-Comp Inc., Cleveland, OH1996Google Scholar). LDL signaling to p125FAK is not dependent on TxA2 formation or activation of PKC, p38MAPK, and ERK1/2. These observations indicate that p125FAK phosphorylation occurs directly downstream of the LDL receptor. P125FAK is phosphorylated independent of αIIbβ3 when platelets adhere to immobilized collagen via integrin α2β1 (14Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Haimovich B. Regan C. DiFazio L. Ginalis E. Ji P. Purohit U. Rowley R.B. Bolen J. Greco R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16332-16337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Polanowska-Grabowska R. Geanacopoulos M. Gear A.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or to immobilized IgG via the FcγRII receptor (15Haimovich B. Regan C. DiFazio L. Ginalis E. Ji P. Purohit U. Rowley R.B. Bolen J. Greco R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16332-16337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the LDL particle acts as an activating surface that phosphorylates p125FAK by clustering of membrane receptors. However, antibodies against integrin α2β1and FcγRII, known to block further signal generation to p125FAK, had no effect. Additionally, LPA did not induce p125FAK phosphorylation. Another candidate for LDL-induced p125FAK phosphorylation is the collagen receptor glycoprotein (GP)VI. Collagen signaling through this glycoprotein leads to phosphorylation of p125FAK (45Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Arai M. Yamamoto N. Takahashi H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 63-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and is inhibited by cAMP (46Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. Okuma M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28029-28036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, GPVI-mediated p125FAK phosphorylation is not observed in Glanzmann's platelets or in the presence of the RGDS peptide, such in contrast to the effect of LDL. The nature of the cAMP sensitivity of p125FAK phosphorylation by LDL remains to be elucidated. A rise in cAMP leads to activation of protein kinase A, that in turn can activate vasodilator-stimulated protein (VASP), a 50-kDa protein that localizes to focal adhesions and regulates actin dynamics (47Haffner C. Jarchau T. Reinhard M. Hoppe J. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of VASP correlates with a decrease in αIIbβ3 activation and aggregation (48Horstrup K. Jablonka B. Honig Liedl P. Just M. Kochsiek K. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, cAMP might inhibit LDL signaling to p125FAK via VASP by preventing cytoskeleton rearrangements. It has been reported that phosphorylation of p125FAK on Tyr397 induces Src activity, leading to phosphorylation of Tyr407,576,577, inducing maximal kinase activity of the protein (7Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the importance of p125FAK activity remains unclear. P125FAK knockout mice were not viable, and embryonic cells of these mice had a reduced mobility. Surprisingly, the number of focal adhesions in these mice was increased. From these observations, it was proposed that p125FAK regulates focal contact turnover (49Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar), rather than their formation. Two major signaling mechanisms downstream of p125FAK are: (i) p130CAS associates to one of the two C-terminal proline-rich regions of p125FAK. This association results in phosphorylation of p130CAS and subsequent binding of Crk via its SH2 domain (reviewed in Refs. 5Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 6Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Crk can associate with the GDP/GTP exchange factors Sos (for Ras) or C3G (for Rap1) (50Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. et al.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). (ii) The GTPase regulator associated with FAK (Graf) associates directly to p125FAK via the proline-rich region of residues Pro875–Arg880 in an SH3 domain-dependent manner. Activation of Graf was induced by phosphorylation mediated by ERK1/2 and was shown to stimulate the GTPase activity of CDC42 and Rho, but not Ras or Rac (51Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The implications of CDC42 and Rho activity for stress fiber and focal adhesion assembly (52Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3728) Google Scholar) led to the proposition that activation of Graf might down-regulate these CDC42 and Rho-mediated cytoskeletal changes (1Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Recently, we observed that LDL induced activation of the small GTPases Rap1 and Ral in platelets. 2C. M. Hackeng et al., submitted for publication.Activation of Rap1 and Ral critically depend on Ca2+ (53Franke B. Akkerman J.W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar,54Wolthuis R.M.F. Franke B. Triest M.v. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W.N. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and Ral is a putative effector molecule of Rap1 (55Spaargaren M. Bischoff J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12609-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In turn, Ral is thought to be an upstream regulator of a member of the Rac/Rho family, CDC42. This small GTPase is involved in the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. The strong phosphorylation of p125FAKtriggered by LDL described in the present report might therefore initiate these two pathways: (i) activation of Rap1 and Ral and CDC42 via C3G and (ii) cytoskeleton regulation via Ral-activated Rho, controlled by Graf. In conclusion, via these two separate mechanisms, LDL might be controlling cytoskeleton rearrangements, thereby targeting several signal transducing proteins to an appropriate site of action, leading to an increased sensitivity to platelet agonists such as α-thrombin and collagen.

https://openalex.org/W2038445932,"β1-null GD25 fibroblasts adherent to vitronectin fail to bind the N-terminal 70-kDa matrix assembly domain of fibronectin or to assemble fibronectin (Sakai, T., Zhang, Q., Fässler, R., and Mosher, D. F. (1998) J. Cell Biol.141, 527–538). We have made four observations that extend this finding. First, the presence of vitronectin on a substrate that otherwise can support fibronectin assembly has a dominant-negative effect on assembly. Second, the dominant-negative effect is lost when active β1A is expressed. Third, β1A containing the extracellular D130A inactivating mutation has a dominant-negative effect on fibronectin assembly. Fourth, β1-null cells adherent to vitronectin are flat and lack filopodia, whereas β1-null cells adherent to fibronectin or β1A-expressing cells adherent to either vitronectin or fibronectin are contracted and exhibit numerous filopodia. These results reveal, therefore, that GD25 cells adherent to vitronectin can only assume a shape suitable for assembly of fibronectin when there is a countervailing signal from functional β1-integrins. β1-null GD25 fibroblasts adherent to vitronectin fail to bind the N-terminal 70-kDa matrix assembly domain of fibronectin or to assemble fibronectin (Sakai, T., Zhang, Q., Fässler, R., and Mosher, D.

Among the membrane components implicated in fibronectin matrix assembly, integrins have been firmly demonstrated to have a central role (5Wu C. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. McDonald J.A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Integrins are a group of cell surface heterdimers of α- and β-glycoprotein subunits that mediate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, and collagen or to countereceptors on other cells (11Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar, 12Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8940) Google Scholar). The interactions between integrins and their ligands influence a number of cellular processes, including proliferation (13Rosales C. O'Brien V. Kornberg L. Juliano R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 77-98PubMed Google Scholar), differentiation (14Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Development (Camb.). 1993; 117: 1183-1198PubMed Google Scholar), survival (15Meredith Jr., J. Fazeli B.

Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of the two subunits are noncovalently associated, forming a ligand-binding pocket, and the cytoplasmic domains interact with cytoskeletal proteins and other cytoplasmic components (12Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8940) Google Scholar). In addition to mediating adherence, ligation of integrins activates signal transduction pathways (19Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar,20Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which integrins modulate fibronectin assembly are not well understood. Transfection of α5-integrin and expression of α5β1-integrin by CHO1cells results in a large increase in fibronectin assembly (5Wu C. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21883-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). A chimera comprising the interleukin 2 receptor and the cytoplasmic tail of β1, working presumably in a dominant-negative manner, inhibits assembly (22LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to α5 or β1 inhibit binding and assembly of fibronectin by fibroblasts and also binding of the N-terminal fibronectin fragment to cell surfaces (23Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Chen W.-T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 24Fogerty F.J. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The 70-kDa N-terminal fragment of fibronectin that mediates binding to assembly sites colocalizes with β1-integrin in focal contacts of cycloheximide-treated cells (25Dzamba B.J. Bultmann H. Akiyama S.K. Peters D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19646-19652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of α5 knock-out mice and cells derived from these mice and also of β1 knock-out cells (7Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J.

Hynes R.O. Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 1093-1105PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that other molecules can substitute for α5β1 in matrix assembly. Expression of activated forms of αIIbβ3 allows CHO cells to assemble a fibronectin matrix (6Wu C. Keivens V.M. O'Toole T.E. McDonald J.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 27Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of αv, which can pair with β1 or β3 (28Zhang Z. Morla A.O. Vuori K. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), or α4, which pairs with β1 (29Wu C. Fields A.J. Kapteijn B.A.E. McDonald J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 821-829PubMed Google Scholar), does not confer assembly competency to CHO cells. Transfection of α3 causing overexpression of α3β1, an adhesion receptor for entactin and other molecules, however, allows assembly of fibronectin if CHO cells are cultured on an entactin-coated substrate; such assembly is not blocked by antibodies to the cell adhesion domain of fibronectin (30Wu C. Chung A.E. McDonald J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2511-2523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, expression of several different integrins allows adherent cells to be assembly competent, and the specific integrins specifically required seem dependent on the substrate to which assembling cells are adherent. We recently found that β1-integrin-null GD25 fibroblasts fail to bind the N-terminal 70-kDa matrix assembly domain of fibronectin when the cells are cultured on vitronectin (10Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We now show that adhesion to intact vitronectin has a dominant-negative effect on fibronectin matrix assembly by GD25 cells and that expression of functional β1A-integrin overcomes the suppression of fibronectin matrix assembly by the vitronectin-coated surface. GD25 cells on vitronectin were well spread, but GD25 cells on fibronectin or GD25-β1A cells on either vitronectin or fibronectin were contracted and displayed numerous hairy protrusions. These results indicate that one role of β1A-integrin is to facilitate cytoskeleton organization and cell shape and that this signal is missing when β1A-deficient cells are adherent to vitronectin. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Fatty acid-free bovine albumin was from Sigma. Vitronectin was purified in its native form (31Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human plasma fibronectin and the 70-kDa N-terminal, gelatin-binding fragment of fibronectin generated by cathepsin D were isolated, iodinated, and reisolated as described previously (32McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 33McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Fibronectin was also labeled with FITC (33McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were stored in portions at −70 °C in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine albumin. A chimeric protein comprising residues 1–53 of vitronectin and the gelatin-binding part of fibronectin (vitronectin portion N-terminal to the fibronectin portion) was constructed and expressed in insect cells using a published strategy (34Astermark J. Sottile J. Mosher D.F. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3690-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-fibronectin and anti-vitronectin antisera were produced in rabbits. IgG was purified from sera by affinity chromatography on protein A. Recombinant modules III7–III10 of human fibronectin were expressed in bacteria and purified (35Leahy D.J. Erickson H.P. Aukhil I. Joshi P. Hendrickson W.A. Proteins. 1994; 19: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) using the expression plasmid kindly provided by Harold Erickson (Duke University). To introduce mutations into the synergistic sequence DRVPHSRN in the III-9 module, in vitromutagenesis by two-stage polymerase chain reaction was performed using 5′ or 3′ oligonucleotides containing the base changes and 3′ or 5′ oligonucleotides outside two convenient BamHI restriction sites. After confirmation of the sequence, the mutated fragment was cloned into the III7–III10-expressing vector (35Leahy D.J. Erickson H.P. Aukhil I. Joshi P. Hendrickson W.A. Proteins. 1994; 19: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), replacing the natural BamHI-BamHI fragment. This yielded the mutated polypeptides III7–III10 R1374A, R1374,1379A, and R1379A; in which DRVPHSRN was changed to DAVPHSRN, DAVPHSAN, and DRVPHSAN, respectively. GD25 and GD10 cells were obtained by differentiation of the β1-null stem cell clone G201, which is deficient in the integrin β1 subunit because of disruption of the β1 gene by homologous recombination (36Fässler R. Pfaff M. Murphy J. Noegel A.A. Johansson S. Timpl R. Albrecht R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). GD25-β1A cells transfected with the β1A splice variant of β1-integrin were those described by Wennerberg et al. (7Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). D130A mutant β1A was generated in the pBSβ1A expression plasmid (7Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) by oligonucleotide-primed DNA synthesis using the U.S.E. mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Stably transformed cell lines were cloned after electroporation of the mutant β1A cDNA into GD25 cells using puromycin resistance for selection (7Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 10Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). GD25 and GD10 cells were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY) (i.e. nonselection medium). The β1A-expressing cell lines were cultured in the same medium plus 10 μg/ml puromycin (selection medium) and placed in medium lacking puromycin only for short-term experiments. Cell surface levels of β1A, α5, and α6 were monitored by flow cytometry, and clones were chosen in which expression of mutant β1A was the same as GD25 cells expressing wild-type β1A (10Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion and migration assays were performed as described previously (10Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Confluent cell layers were usually studied 3 d after sparse seeding in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. For 2–4-h culture without serum, tissue culture plastic wells were coated overnight with adhesive proteins, 0.02–10 μg/ml, in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, followed by blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h. In preparation for experimentation, confluent cells were treated with trypsin and EDTA until cells detached (usually 5 min for GD25-β1A and GD25-β1A/D130A and 10–15 min for GD25 and GD10), followed by washing twice with DMEM and resuspension at 4 × 105 cells/2-cm2well in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Endogenous fibronectin accumulation in cell layers plus medium during the 2–4-h initial incubation time was measured by Western blot. For binding studies, freshly seeded cells on the adhesive substrates or the confluent cell layers were washed with Tris-buffered saline and incubated with 125I-labeled fibronectin or 70-kDa fragment of fibronectin in DMEM containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine albumin in the absence or presence of 400 nm LPA for 60 min as described (37Zhang Q. Checovich W.J. Peters D.M. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cells cultured on different adhesive substrate-coated glass coverslips were incubated with 400 nm LPA for 60 min at 37 °C. For visualization of bound exogenous fibronectin, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml FITC-labeled human plasma fibronectin for 60 min at 37 °C. For localization of endogenous fibronectin, cell layers were fixed and incubated with 1:1000 rabbit anti-human fibronectin at 37 °C for 2 h, after the detection of the polyclonal antibody by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The anti-fibronectin was shown to be cross-reactive with mouse fibronectin at this dilution. Coverslips were mounted with glycerol gel (Sigma), and cells were viewed on an Olympus epifluorescence microscope or a Bio-Rad confocal microscope at the Keck Facility of the University of Wisconsin. For scanning electron microscopy, cells were washed, prefixed, and post-fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and then 0.1% osmium tetroxide, both in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.0. Post-fixed cells were washed, dehydrated with ethanol, and critical point-dried (38Peters D.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cells were examined on a Hitachi S-900 high resolution, low voltage, scanning electron microscope at the Integrated Microscopy Resource of the University of Wisconsin. The fibronectin matrix of confluent GD25 cells expressing β1A integrin is more extensive than the fibronectin matrix of confluent β1-null GD25 cells (7Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 10Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Assembly of fibronectin matrix involves a reversible binding step, which is mediated by the N-terminal region of fibronectin, followed by insolubilization of the fibronectin molecules to form SDS-insoluble multimers (4Mosher D.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 214-222Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 39Chen H. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9084-9089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We previously found that the N-terminal fragment of fibronectin binds to GD25 cells after adherence to fibronectin but not after adherence to vitronectin (10Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To understand how assembly of fibronectin is modulated by vitronectin and β1-integrins and to relate our findings to those of Wennerberget al. (7Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we carried out additional studies with GD25 cells lacking β1-integrin, GD25-β1A cells, which are stably transfected with the cDNA encoding wild-type murine integrin β1A, and GD25-β1A/D130A cells, which express β1A with the inactivating D130A mutation in the extracellular domain. Initial experiments replicated the conditions of Wennerberg et al. (7Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in serum-containing medium and then incubated with the125I-labeled N-terminal 70-kDa fragment of fibronectin in the absence or presence of LPA, which enhances the binding and assembly of fibronectin (37Zhang Q. Checovich W.J. Peters D.M. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 40Checovich W.J. Mosher D.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1662-1667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Zhang Q. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33284-33292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast to the quantitative and qualitative decrement in fibronectin staining observed around confluent GD25 cells compared with confluent GD25-β1A cells (7Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 10Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the two cell lines bound the 70-kDa fragment equally well (Fig.1). Similar results were also found in a 1-h assay of binding of intact fibronectin to confluent cells (data not shown). To learn whether decreased fibronectin matrix at confluence is attributable to a deficiency in assembly as GD25 cells are growing to confluence, we studied cells shortly after seeding onto one or the other of the major adhesive proteins in serum; i.e. GD25 and GD25-β1A cells were seeded densely on a substrate coated with vitronectin or fibronectin for 2–4 h and tested for binding of FITC-labeled fibronectin or 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment of fibronectin. Endogenous fibronectin accumulation in cell layers plus medium during the 2–4-h incubation as measured by Western blotting was similar for GD25 cells and GD25-β1A cells: 10–50 ng/2-cm2 well. GD25 and GD25-β1A cells on both vitronectin and fibronectin substrate had small amounts of cell surface fibronectin staining in punctate or short linear patterns when analyzed by immunofluorescence with antibodies that recognized mouse fibronectin (Fig. 2, a–d). The staining was greatest on GD25-β1A cells adherent to fibronectin. GD25 cells on vitronectin did not bind FITC-fibronectin, whereas short linear arrays of FITC-fibronectin binding were abundant when GD25 cells on fibronectin (Fig. 2, A and B). GD25-β1A cells adherent on either vitronectin or fibronectin had cell-associated FITC-fibronectin fibrils, especially at areas of cell-cell interaction (Fig. 2, C and D). Binding of the 125I-labeled N-terminal 70-kDa fragment of fibronectin to the freshly seeded monolayers correlated with results of fluorescence microscopy. The 70-kDa fragment bound specifically to GD25 cells spread on fibronectin (Fig.3 A) and GD25-β1A cells spread on either vitronectin or fibronectin (Fig. 3 B). Binding to GD25 cells spread on fibronectin or GD25-β1A cells spread on fibronectin or vitronectin was enhanced by LPA treatment (Fig. 3,A and B). For LPA-treated GD25 and GD25-β1A cells spread on fibronectin, the K d values were 7.5 and 4.8 nm, respectively, versus 10.8 and 9.0 nm for the same cells without LPA treatment, and there were 170,000 and 190,000 binding sites per LPA-treated cell, respectively,versus 110,000 and 130,000 sites for untreated cells. GD25-β1A cells spread on vitronectin bound less 70-kDa fragment compared with GD25-β1A cells spread on fibronectin (Fig.3 B); the K d was 8.7 nm with LPA versus 14.4 nm without LPA, and there were 80,000 binding sites per LPA-treated cell versus 59,000 sites per untreated cell. GD25 cells spread on vitronectin did not bind the 70-kDa fragment specifically, even after stimulation with LPA (Fig.3 A). The fact that GD25-β1A cells are capable of 70-kDa fragment binding on vitronectin-coated surfaces, whereas GD25 cells are not, indicates that β1A-integrins overcome the absent or negative input arising from adhesion of cells to vitronectin. We previously found that expression of β1As with inactivating mutations of cytoplasmic residues did not restore the ability of GD25 cells on vitronectin to bind the 70-kDa fragment (10Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To test whether β1A with a wild-type cytoplasmic domain but a nonactive extracellular domain is restorative, a β1A-integrin with a D130A mutation was generated and transfected into GD25 cells. Mutation of the homologous residue in β3 is associated with defective platelet αIIbβ3 function and Glanzmann thrombasthenia (42Loftus J.C. O'Toole T.E. Plow E.F. Glass A. Frelinger A.L. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). GD25 cells expressing the D130A mutant adhered well to vitronectin or fibronectin (TableI) but did not adhere to laminin (data not shown). GD25-β1A/D130A cells did not bind the 70-kDa fragment when adhered to vitronectin, even in the presence of LPA (Fig.4). Therefore, β1A-integrin must have both functional intracellular and extracellular domains to support fibronectin matrix assembly by cells cultured on vitronectin. In contrast to GD25 cells lacking β1A (10Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fässler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), GD25 cells expressing β1A/D130A did not bind the 70-kDa fragment even when cultured on fibronectin (Fig. 4). Furthermore, when D130A cells were studied by immunofluorescence after reaching confluence, no fibronectin extracellular matrix was present (data not shown). These observations indicate that the D130A mutation in β1A has a dominant-negative effect on fibronectin matrix assembly. Adherence of GD25 cells expressing β1A/D130A to either vitronectin or fibronectin and migration of β1A/D130A cells through filters coated with vitronectin or fibronectin was not grossly impaired when compared with GD25 cells or GD25-β1A cells (Table I). Therefore, the dominant-negative effect of β1A/D130A on cells cultured on fibronectin is specific for fibronectin assembly.Table IAdhesion and migration of GD25, GD25-β1A, and GD25-β1A/D130A cellsGD25GD25-β1AGD25-β1A/ D130AAdhesion to vitronectin (A 595)1.56 ± 0.081.87 ± 0.141.23 ± 0.03Adhesion to fibronectin (A 595)1.48 ± 0.021.68 ± 0.120.89 ± 0.03Migration on vitronectin (cells/0.16 cm2)113 ± 5161 ± 2471 ± 5Migration on fibronectin (cells/0.16 cm2)112 ± 4141 ± 27127 ± 13Attachment of GD25, GD25-β1A, and GD25-β1A/D130A cells to vitronectin or fibronectin or migration through vitronectin- or fibronectin-coated filters in response to platelet-derived growth factor, 30 ng/ml.

One explanation for the differential response of the GD25 cells cultured on vitronectin versus fibronectin is that substratum-bound fibronectin is used as a co-polymerizing molecule (43Grinnell F. J.

Therefore, responses of cells adherent to recombinant proteins constituting the central cell adhesion domain of fibronectin were compared with the response to whole fibronectin. GD25 cells spread on III7–III10 were capable of binding of the 70-kDa fragment (Fig. 5). The sequence DRVPHSRN in III9 (residues 1373–1380) has been identified as a synergistic site for integrin functions (47Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol.

We mutagenized the synergy sequences to form R1374A with an Ala in place of the Arg1374, R1379A with an Ala replacing Arg1379, and R1374,1379A with Alas replacing both Args. When the mutant proteins were tested, all supported 70-kDa fragment binding to GD25 cells (Fig. 5). To further investigate the determinants for fibronectin matrix assembly on GD25 cells, residues 1–53 of vitronectin containing the RGD sequence (residues 42–44) were expressed as a chimera with the gelatin-binding part of fibronectin. GD25 cells spreading on this chimeric protein bound the 70-kDa fragment specifically (Fig. 5). Of the seven cell adhesion proteins tested, therefore, all were adhesive for GD25 cells, but only intact vitronectin did not support fibronectin matrix assembly. The LPA stimulation of fibronectin binding and assembly by human fibroblasts correlates with rapid changes in cytoskeleton and cell shape (37Zhang Q. Checovich W.J. Peters D.M. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We therefore performed scanning electron microscopy of GD25 and GD25-β1A cells on vitronectin or fibronectin after treatment with LPA. GD25 cells on vitronectin were well spread (Fig.6 a). GD25 cells on fibronectin (Fig. 6 b) or GD25-β1A cells on either vitronectin (Fig.6 c) or fibronectin (Fig. 6 d) were contracted and displayed numerous hairy protrusions. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the GD25 cells on vitronectin were 4–5 μm high, whereas GD25 cells on fibronectin and GD25-β1A cells on fibronectin or vitronectin were 9–11 μm high (images not shown).

When complexes are formed between the SERPIN and its target protease, there is an accompanying conformational change in the SERPIN that either unmasks or causes the formation of a new binding site in the complexed SERPIN that is not present in the free SERPIN (8Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Perlmutter D.H. Travis J. Punsal P.I. J. Clin.

It ensures that SERPINs will remain extracellular, either in plasma or in tissues near cell surfaces, until they have formed an irreversible complex with a protease.The list of SERPINs dependent on the LRP for cellular internalization includes, protease nexin 1 (PN1) (10Knauer M.F.

It is interesting to note that although the LRP acts as the internalization receptor, other cellular components are most likely required for the efficient catabolism of the SERPIN-Protease complexes (12Kounnas M.Z.

However PN1, which is primarily restricted to tissues, utilizes at least two different cell surface molecules to assist LRP-mediated internalization. When PN1 forms complexes with uPA, the uPA receptor is required for efficient concentration at the cell surface of uPA-PN1 complexes and subsequent internalization via the LRP (11Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In contrast, when PN1 is in complex with thrombin, heparin chains present at the cell surface greatly facilitate the uptake and turnover of thrombin-PN1 complexes (15Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and uPA receptor is not involved (11Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, in the case of PN1, the nature of the target protease directly plays a role in the clearance mechanism.In a recent study using a synthetic peptide library strategy, a putative LRP-binding site was identified in PN1 (10Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The library consisted of peptides 12 amino acids in length, and spanned nearly the entire PN1 sequence. A single peptide in the library,47PHDNIVISPHGI58 was identified as a potent inhibitor of Th-PN1 internalization and degradation. Using α-1-antitrypsin structure and sequence alignments, this sequence is predicted to be a transition sequence that occurs just after helix A and continues to form the sixth strand of sheet B (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Consequently, this site meets the criteria of being at least partially buried in the intact SERPIN, with the potential of becoming more exposed after complex formation with thrombin. There is no direct evidence, however, to distinguish this possibility from a simple conformational change in which the exposure of this site remains constant.In the present studies we further investigate the potential role of this putative site in LRP-mediated internalization using two different approaches. In the first approach, a polyclonal IgG was generated against Pro47–Ile58 with a cysteine residue added after the Ile to facilitate haptenization to ovalbumin. We demonstrate that this antibody specifically and selectively inhibits the binding of Th-PN1 complexes to the LRP, but does not affect the interaction of the complexes with cell surface heparins. In the second approach we utilize site-directed mutagenesis and baculovirus-driven expression in insect cells. Two variant forms of PN1 were expressed; one with an alanine substitution at the position of His 48 (H48A), and another with alanine substitutions at the positions of His 48 and Asp 49 (H48A,D49A). Each PN1 variant was characterized biochemically by determining the k assoc value for thrombin inhibition and ability to form SDS-resistant complexes with thrombin. Additionally, the PN1 variant-thrombin complexes and native PN1-thrombin complexes were assayed for their capacity to bind to cell surface heparins. While the PN1 variants were found to be very similar to native PN1 in their ability to inactivate thrombin and bind to cell surface heparins, complexes made with each of the PN1 variants showed decreased rates of catabolism. These experiments define a critical role for the structural determinant, Pro47–Ile58, in the LRP-mediated internalization of Th-PN1 complexes. These data also demonstrate that with the use of anti-(Pro47–Ile58) antibody, cell surface heparin binding and LRP-mediated internalization of Th-PN1 complexes can be studied as independent events, even though they act cooperatively to facilitate complex catabolism.DISCUSSIONThe present studies were undertaken to further probe the potential role of the PN1 peptide sequence,47PHDNIVISPHGI58, in the LRP-mediated clearance of Th-PN1 complexes and to determine what structural features of this sequence might be important in this process. The potential importance of this sequence was discovered using a synthetic peptide library of PN1 sequences and screening for peptides that inhibited the catabolism of complexes by HF cells (10Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The requirement for heparin-mediated binding of the complexes to the cell surface to promote an efficient interaction between the complexes and the LRP (15Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) precluded more detailed studies of this sequence using a synthetic peptide approach, because the sites in PN1 that interact with heparin and the LRP are distinct. In the present studies, two different approaches have been used to more clearly define the role of the structural determinant, Pro47–Ile58, in Th-PN1 complex catabolism and to identify critical residues within this determinant.To independently confirm and more narrowly define the role of this structural determinant in Th-PN1 catabolism, an anti-(Pro47–Ile58) polyclonal IgG was generated. This antibody specifically inhibited the internalization and subsequent degradation of Th-PN1 complexes but had no effect on the binding of complexes to cell surface heparins. These data independently confirm the role of Pro47–Ile58 in LRP-mediated internalization, which had previously been based solely on synthetic peptide competition studies (10Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, they strongly suggest that the LRP and heparin-binding determinants in PN1 are structurally distinct, despite the fact that they act cooperatively to promote efficient complex catabolism (15Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In addition to the antibody studies, a genetic approach was used in which alanine substitutions were introduced at positions His48 and Asp49 of the intact PN1 protein. The rationale for these choices is derived from the predicted structural location of 47PHDNIVISPHGI58 in PN1 based on its homology to α-1-antitrypsin (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). This sequence is predicted to be at least partially interior to the protein surface. Pro47most likely represents the beginning of the transition sequence between helix A and strand 6B(1). His48 and Asp49 are transition amino acids, and Asn50 through Pro55become strand 6 of sheet B. Given this structural information, we hypothesized that the charged residues, His48 and Asp49, might be important for either direct interaction with the LRP receptor or assisting in the attainment of the active conformation of this structural determinant when fully exposed to the hydrophilic exterior of the molecule.To evaluate the role of these specific amino acids we generated two different PN1 variants: one in which only His48 was replaced by Ala and another where both His48 and Asp49 were replaced by Ala. Replacement of the first charged residue, His48 by Ala, had a significant effect on the catabolism of PN1(H48A) complexes, reducing it by 50%. The additional substitution of Ala for Asp49, reduced complex catabolism by 85%. In both cases this was demonstrated to be due to a decreased rate of LRP-mediated internalization. Control studies revealed that the substitutions had no effect on the heparin-mediated binding of the complexes to the cell surface nor on the biochemical characteristics of the PN1 variant complexes with thrombin. Taken together, it is clear that both His48 and Asp49play very important roles in the interaction of the PN1 structural determinant, 47PHDNIVISPHGI58, with the LRP. Whether this is due to a direct interaction of these residues with the LRP or because these residues are required to establish a particular structural conformation of this determinant is presently unknown. Given the overall hydrophobic character of Pro47–Ile58, (PHDNIVISPHGI), it is likely that removal of the charged residues affects the solubility of the sequence. The genetic evidence using PN1 variants with point substitutions and the anti-(Pro47–Ile58) antibody experiments represent two important and independent lines of evidence that support and extend the original observation that the sequence Pro47–Ile58 in PN1 is required for the LRP-mediated clearance of Th-PN1 complexes.A common pathway for many LRP internalized ligands seems to be emerging that involves cell surface proteoglycans and perhaps other accessory proteins in many cases. Several of the ligands first bind to cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans and are subsequently internalized by the LRP (15Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Even Th-ATIII complexes, which display a negligible affinity for heparin, use hepatic heparin sulfate proteoglycans as a part of their clearance mechanism but do so by an association with vitronectin (Vn) (14Wells M.J. Blajchman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Th-ATIII complexes first bind to Vn and then utilize the heparin-binding site in Vn, which is exposed only after it binds to Th-ATIII complexes (14Wells M.J. Blajchman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, another accessory molecule, cytokeratin 18, has been shown to play an important role in the clearance of Th-ATIII-Vn ternary complexes (13Wells M.J. Hatton M.W. Hewlett B. Podor T.J. Sheffield W.P. Blajchman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28574-28581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for cytokeratin 18 were shown to markedly reduce the LRP-mediated internalization of Th-ATIII-Vn ternary complexes. Although the heparin-mediated pathway appears to be common for many LRP internalized ligands, there is at least one example where the involvement of heparin has not yet been documented (27Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The uPA receptor binds complexes between high molecular weight urokinase and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 or PN1 prior to LRP-mediated internalization (27Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). There are data suggesting that the uPA receptor, as well as its bound ligand, is co-internalized along with the LRP (16Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Because plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 does contain a heparin-binding site, however, the potential involvement of heparin in this pathway should be examined more carefully.Structural information on binding sites in ligands that interact with the LRP is, however, limited. The highest resolution studies have been done on the LRP-binding site in activated α2-macroglobulin, which identified lysine residues 1370 and 1374 as essential for binding to the LRP (28Nielsen K.L. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Thogersen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12909-12912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The LRP-binding site in thrombospondin 1 has been localized to the same amino-terminal fragment that contains the heparin-binding domain (25Mikhailenko I. Krylov D. Argraves K.M. Roberts D.D. Liau G. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6784-6791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the carboxyl-terminal folding domain of lipoprotein lipase, which also contains the heparin-binding domain, has been implicated in binding to the LRP (26Nielsen M.S. Brejning J. Garcı́a R. Zhang H. Hayden M.R. Vilar S. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5821-5827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Most recently, studies on the binding of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1-protease complexes to the LRP have implicated two residues located in the heparin-binding site in LRP binding (27Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These data may be subject to alternate interpretations, because the opposite charge nature of the amino acid substitutions in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 variants that resulted in a decreased LRP affinity may impart structural changes in the general region that are not necessarily part of the heparin-binding site (27Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, data supporting any type of a universal structural motif shared by all LRP ligands are not very compelling, because the ligands are diverse, and many of the ligands do not cross-compete for binding (28Nielsen K.L. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Thogersen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12909-12912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the binding of several LRP ligands to cell surface heparins has been shown to play an important role in their clearance by the LRP, it remains to be determined whether the heparin and the LRP-binding sites overlap in some cases. The data in the present report, along with previously published studies using synthetic peptides strongly argue against this in the case of PN1.

When complexes are formed between the SERPIN and its target protease, there is an accompanying conformational change in the SERPIN that either unmasks or causes the formation of a new binding site in the complexed SERPIN that is not present in the free SERPIN (8Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9Perlmutter D.H. Travis J. Punsal P.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1774-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cryptic nature of the LRP-binding site in the free SERPIN makes sense biologically. It ensures that SERPINs will remain extracellular, either in plasma or in tissues near cell surfaces, until they have formed an irreversible complex with a protease. The list of SERPINs dependent on the LRP for cellular internalization includes, protease nexin 1 (PN1) (10Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol.

It is interesting to note that although the LRP acts as the internalization receptor, other cellular components are most likely required for the efficient catabolism of the SERPIN-Protease complexes (12Kounnas M.Z.

However PN1, which is primarily restricted to tissues, utilizes at least two different cell surface molecules to assist LRP-mediated internalization. When PN1 forms complexes with uPA, the uPA receptor is required for efficient concentration at the cell surface of uPA-PN1 complexes and subsequent internalization via the LRP (11Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In contrast, when PN1 is in complex with thrombin, heparin chains present at the cell surface greatly facilitate the uptake and turnover of thrombin-PN1 complexes (15Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and uPA receptor is not involved (11Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, in the case of PN1, the nature of the target protease directly plays a role in the clearance mechanism. In a recent study using a synthetic peptide library strategy, a putative LRP-binding site was identified in PN1 (10Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The library consisted of peptides 12 amino acids in length, and spanned nearly the entire PN1 sequence. A single peptide in the library,47PHDNIVISPHGI58 was identified as a potent inhibitor of Th-PN1 internalization and degradation. Using α-1-antitrypsin structure and sequence alignments, this sequence is predicted to be a transition sequence that occurs just after helix A and continues to form the sixth strand of sheet B (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Consequently, this site meets the criteria of being at least partially buried in the intact SERPIN, with the potential of becoming more exposed after complex formation with thrombin. There is no direct evidence, however, to distinguish this possibility from a simple conformational change in which the exposure of this site remains constant. In the present studies we further investigate the potential role of this putative site in LRP-mediated internalization using two different approaches. In the first approach, a polyclonal IgG was generated against Pro47–Ile58 with a cysteine residue added after the Ile to facilitate haptenization to ovalbumin. We demonstrate that this antibody specifically and selectively inhibits the binding of Th-PN1 complexes to the LRP, but does not affect the interaction of the complexes with cell surface heparins. In the second approach we utilize site-directed mutagenesis and baculovirus-driven expression in insect cells. Two variant forms of PN1 were expressed; one with an alanine substitution at the position of His 48 (H48A), and another with alanine substitutions at the positions of His 48 and Asp 49 (H48A,D49A). Each PN1 variant was characterized biochemically by determining the k assoc value for thrombin inhibition and ability to form SDS-resistant complexes with thrombin. Additionally, the PN1 variant-thrombin complexes and native PN1-thrombin complexes were assayed for their capacity to bind to cell surface heparins. While the PN1 variants were found to be very similar to native PN1 in their ability to inactivate thrombin and bind to cell surface heparins, complexes made with each of the PN1 variants showed decreased rates of catabolism. These experiments define a critical role for the structural determinant, Pro47–Ile58, in the LRP-mediated internalization of Th-PN1 complexes. These data also demonstrate that with the use of anti-(Pro47–Ile58) antibody, cell surface heparin binding and LRP-mediated internalization of Th-PN1 complexes can be studied as independent events, even though they act cooperatively to facilitate complex catabolism. DISCUSSIONThe present studies were undertaken to further probe the potential role of the PN1 peptide sequence,47PHDNIVISPHGI58, in the LRP-mediated clearance of Th-PN1 complexes and to determine what structural features of this sequence might be important in this process. The potential importance of this sequence was discovered using a synthetic peptide library of PN1 sequences and screening for peptides that inhibited the catabolism of complexes by HF cells (10Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The requirement for heparin-mediated binding of the complexes to the cell surface to promote an efficient interaction between the complexes and the LRP (15Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) precluded more detailed studies of this sequence using a synthetic peptide approach, because the sites in PN1 that interact with heparin and the LRP are distinct. In the present studies, two different approaches have been used to more clearly define the role of the structural determinant, Pro47–Ile58, in Th-PN1 complex catabolism and to identify critical residues within this determinant.To independently confirm and more narrowly define the role of this structural determinant in Th-PN1 catabolism, an anti-(Pro47–Ile58) polyclonal IgG was generated. This antibody specifically inhibited the internalization and subsequent degradation of Th-PN1 complexes but had no effect on the binding of complexes to cell surface heparins. These data independently confirm the role of Pro47–Ile58 in LRP-mediated internalization, which had previously been based solely on synthetic peptide competition studies (10Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, they strongly suggest that the LRP and heparin-binding determinants in PN1 are structurally distinct, despite the fact that they act cooperatively to promote efficient complex catabolism (15Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29039-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In addition to the antibody studies, a genetic approach was used in which alanine substitutions were introduced at positions His48 and Asp49 of the intact PN1 protein. The rationale for these choices is derived from the predicted structural location of 47PHDNIVISPHGI58 in PN1 based on its homology to α-1-antitrypsin (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). This sequence is predicted to be at least partially interior to the protein surface. Pro47most likely represents the beginning of the transition sequence between helix A and strand 6B(1). His48 and Asp49 are transition amino acids, and Asn50 through Pro55become strand 6 of sheet B. Given this structural information, we hypothesized that the charged residues, His48 and Asp49, might be important for either direct interaction with the LRP receptor or assisting in the attainment of the active conformation of this structural determinant when fully exposed to the hydrophilic exterior of the molecule.To evaluate the role of these specific amino acids we generated two different PN1 variants: one in which only His48 was replaced by Ala and another where both His48 and Asp49 were replaced by Ala. Replacement of the first charged residue, His48 by Ala, had a significant effect on the catabolism of PN1(H48A) complexes, reducing it by 50%. The additional substitution of Ala for Asp49, reduced complex catabolism by 85%. In both cases this was demonstrated to be due to a decreased rate of LRP-mediated internalization. Control studies revealed that the substitutions had no effect on the heparin-mediated binding of the complexes to the cell surface nor on the biochemical characteristics of the PN1 variant complexes with thrombin. Taken together, it is clear that both His48 and Asp49play very important roles in the interaction of the PN1 structural determinant, 47PHDNIVISPHGI58, with the LRP. Whether this is due to a direct interaction of these residues with the LRP or because these residues are required to establish a particular structural conformation of this determinant is presently unknown. Given the overall hydrophobic character of Pro47–Ile58, (PHDNIVISPHGI), it is likely that removal of the charged residues affects the solubility of the sequence. The genetic evidence using PN1 variants with point substitutions and the anti-(Pro47–Ile58) antibody experiments represent two important and independent lines of evidence that support and extend the original observation that the sequence Pro47–Ile58 in PN1 is required for the LRP-mediated clearance of Th-PN1 complexes.A common pathway for many LRP internalized ligands seems to be emerging that involves cell surface proteoglycans and perhaps other accessory proteins in many cases. Several of the ligands first bind to cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans and are subsequently internalized by the LRP (15Knauer M.F. Kridel S.J. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol.

Even Th-ATIII complexes, which display a negligible affinity for heparin, use hepatic heparin sulfate proteoglycans as a part of their clearance mechanism but do so by an association with vitronectin (Vn) (14Wells M.J. Blajchman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Th-ATIII complexes first bind to Vn and then utilize the heparin-binding site in Vn, which is exposed only after it binds to Th-ATIII complexes (14Wells M.J. Blajchman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, another accessory molecule, cytokeratin 18, has been shown to play an important role in the clearance of Th-ATIII-Vn ternary complexes (13Wells M.J. Hatton M.W. Hewlett B. Podor T.J. Sheffield W.P. Blajchman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28574-28581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for cytokeratin 18 were shown to markedly reduce the LRP-mediated internalization of Th-ATIII-Vn ternary complexes. Although the heparin-mediated pathway appears to be common for many LRP internalized ligands, there is at least one example where the involvement of heparin has not yet been documented (27Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The uPA receptor binds complexes between high molecular weight urokinase and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 or PN1 prior to LRP-mediated internalization (27Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). There are data suggesting that the uPA receptor, as well as its bound ligand, is co-internalized along with the LRP (16Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Because plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 does contain a heparin-binding site, however, the potential involvement of heparin in this pathway should be examined more carefully.Structural information on binding sites in ligands that interact with the LRP is, however, limited. The highest resolution studies have been done on the LRP-binding site in activated α2-macroglobulin, which identified lysine residues 1370 and 1374 as essential for binding to the LRP (28Nielsen K.L. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Thogersen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12909-12912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The LRP-binding site in thrombospondin 1 has been localized to the same amino-terminal fragment that contains the heparin-binding domain (25Mikhailenko I. Krylov D. Argraves K.M. Roberts D.D. Liau G. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6784-6791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the carboxyl-terminal folding domain of lipoprotein lipase, which also contains the heparin-binding domain, has been implicated in binding to the LRP (26Nielsen M.S. Brejning J. Garcı́a R. Zhang H. Hayden M.R. Vilar S. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5821-5827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Most recently, studies on the binding of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1-protease complexes to the LRP have implicated two residues located in the heparin-binding site in LRP binding (27Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These data may be subject to alternate interpretations, because the opposite charge nature of the amino acid substitutions in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 variants that resulted in a decreased LRP affinity may impart structural changes in the general region that are not necessarily part of the heparin-binding site (27Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, data supporting any type of a universal structural motif shared by all LRP ligands are not very compelling, because the ligands are diverse, and many of the ligands do not cross-compete for binding (28Nielsen K.L. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Thogersen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12909-12912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the binding of several LRP ligands to cell surface heparins has been shown to play an important role in their clearance by the LRP, it remains to be determined whether the heparin and the LRP-binding sites overlap in some cases. The data in the present report, along with previously published studies using synthetic peptides strongly argue against this in the case of PN1. The present studies were undertaken to further probe the potential role of the PN1 peptide sequence,47PHDNIVISPHGI58, in the LRP-mediated clearance of Th-PN1 complexes and to determine what structural features of this sequence might be important in this process.

These data may be subject to alternate interpretations, because the opposite charge nature of the amino acid substitutions in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 variants that resulted in a decreased LRP affinity may impart structural changes in the general region that are not necessarily part of the heparin-binding site (27Stefansson S.

In addition, data supporting any type of a universal structural motif shared by all LRP ligands are not very compelling, because the ligands are diverse, and many of the ligands do not cross-compete for binding (28Nielsen K.L. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. Sottrup-Jensen L. Thogersen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12909-12912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the binding of several LRP ligands to cell surface heparins has been shown to play an important role in their clearance by the LRP, it remains to be determined whether the heparin and the LRP-binding sites overlap in some cases. The data in the present report, along with previously published studies using synthetic peptides strongly argue against this in the case of PN1."

The molecular mechanisms regulating neutrophil development are not defined yet. Abnormal neutrophil development is related to several pathological conditions such as neutropenia, neutrophilia, and myelogenous leukemia (1Holyoake T.L. Freshney M.G. Sproul A.M. Richmond L.J.

The regulation of this developmental process most likely involves the interplay of transcription factors with positive and negative cis-acting elements and cytokines interacting with their cognate receptors (4Lenny N.

For example, disrupting either of the murine genes encoding the transcription factors PU.1 (Spi-1) and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α impairs neutrophil development (6Scott E.W. Simon C.

In mature neutrophils, IL-8 is the major mediator for the recruitment of neutrophils from circulation to the sites of injury and infection. Despite the importance of the IL-8 receptor in myeloid development and its restrictive expression in myeloid cells, the transcriptional mechanisms regulating myeloid-specific expression of the IL-8 receptor genes are unknown. Previous studies have shown that CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression is under transcriptional control (14Lloyd A.R. Biragyn A. Johnston J.A. Taub D.D. Xu L. Michiel D. Sprenger H. Oppennheim J.J. Kelvin D.J.

The CXCR1 gene consists of two exons interrupted by an intron of ∼1.7 kilobases. The entire open reading frame is encoded in exon 2. Sprengeret al. (15Sprenger H. Lloyd A.R. Meyer R.G. Johnston J.A.

However, identification of regulatory elements and transcription factors regulating the myeloid lineage-specific expression of the CXCR1 gene have been precluded by the lack of suitable myeloid cell lines expressing high levels of CXCR1 or CXCR2. In this work we delineate cis-acting elements that direct myeloid-specific expression of the CXCR1 promoter and identify the ets family transcription factor PU.1 as a major regulator of the CXCR1 promoter. Cell culture supplies were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. 32Dcl3 cells were a gift from Dr. Joel Greenberger (University of Pittsburgh Medical School, Pittsburg, PA). NIH3T3, RAW264.7, and CEMT4 cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). 32Dcl3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% WEHI-3B conditioned media, 15% fetal bovine serum, and 50 IU/ml penicillin-50 μg/ml streptomycin. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 IU/ml penicillin-50 μg/ml streptomycin. CEMT4 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 IU/ml penicillin-50 μg/ml streptomycin. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium (1 g/l d-glucose) supplemented with 10% bovine serum and 50 IU/ml penicillin-50 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Total RNA was isolated by the RNAzol procedure (Biotecx Laboratories Inc., Houston, TX). Total RNA (10 μg) was fractionated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels and blotted to nylon membranes (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA). The blot was probed with murine PU.1, murine CXCR2, and human β-actin cDNAs labeled by random priming with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN). The blot was hybridized at 42 °C for 16–20 h in the following solution: 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE (750 mmNaCl, 500 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 200 μg/ml sonicated calf thymus DNA. Blots were washed three times for 10 min with 0.5 × SSC (75 mm sodium chloride, 7.5 mm sodium citrate) and 1% SDS at 65 °C. The blot for β-actin was washed two times for 10 min with 0.1 × SSC and 1% SDS at 65 °C. Peripheral blood was collected from healthy human donors and placed in a 1% sodium citrate (anticoagulant) solution. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes as described (17John S.W.M. Weitzner G. Rozen R. Scriver C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 408Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). A forward primer corresponding to −800 to −777 bp of CXCR1 and containing an XhoI site (5′-CGGCTCGAGGCTAACCAGCCAGACTCTGGGAGT-3′), and a reverse primer corresponding to +63 to +86 bp of CXCR1 and containing aHindIII site (5′-GGACACACCTAAGCACCGGCCAGGTGTGTC-3′) were used to amplify an 889-bp 5′-flanking region of CXCR1 (15Sprenger H. Lloyd A.R. Meyer R.G. Johnston J.A. Kelvin D.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2524-2532PubMed Google Scholar). Conditions of PCR included a step of 95 °C for 3 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min 30 s, 65 °C for 1 min 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s, and a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified PCR product was gel-purified and digested withXhoI and HindIII, and cloned intoSalI-HindIII sites upstream of a luciferase cDNA in a promoterless pGEM-3 vector referred to as pLUC. Deletion constructs were made by digestion with unique restriction sites within the CXCR1 sequence (A2 construct,NdeI; A3 construct,AccI; and A4 construct, PstI). The A2 mutant construct was generated by cassette mutagenesis. The sequence (−58 to +50 bp) was removed at AccI-PstI sites and replaced by a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide in which guanine nucleotides at positions −13, −12, −3, and −4 bp in the wild-type sequence were replaced with thymine nucleotides. The pGEM-3 vector containing the SV40 promoter and enhancer upstream of a luciferase cDNA (pSV40/LUC) was used as a positive control. The β-galactosidase reporter gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV/β-gal) was used as an internal control to correct for differences in transfection efficiency between experiments. The vectors pSV40/LUC and pCMV/β-gal were provided by Dr. Allan Braiser (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX). Plasmids were purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation as described by Ausubel et al. (18$$Google Scholar), and the sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing using a Sequenase kit (United States Biochemical Co., Cleveland, OH). Log phase 32Dcl3 (14 × 106), RAW264.7 (107), CEMT4 (107), and NIH3T3 (2.5 × 106) cells were incubated with 20 μg of pIL-8RA/LUC or pSV40/LUC constructs and 2 μg of pCMV/β-gal for 5 min at room temperature, electroporated using a 300-V, 960-μF pulse, and then incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were plated in 5 ml of complete culture media and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were harvested 17 h after electroporation. Transfected cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (25 mmTris-PO4, pH 7.8, 2 mm 1,2 diaminocyclo-N,N,N,N′-tetracetic acid, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), vortexed for 2 min, and stored at −70 °C until ready for reporter gene assays. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed in duplicate with cell lysates (10 μl) from each transfection. Luciferase assays were performed as described inPromega Protocols and Applications Guide (19$$Google Scholar). Lysates were incubated with a luciferase assay reagent composed of 20 mmTricine, 1.07 mm(MgCO3)4MgOH2, 2.67 mmMgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 270 μmcoenzyme A, 470 μm luciferin, 530 μm ATP, and 33.3 mm dithiothreitol. (Coenzyme A, luciferin, ATP, and dithiothreitol were added immediately before each assay.) Purified luciferase was used as a standard. Emitted light was recorded as relative light units using an Analytical Luminescence Laboratory Monolight 2010 luminometer. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). Peripheral blood was collected from healthy human donors and placed in a 1% sodium citrate (anticoagulant) solution. Neutrophils and monocytes were separated from other cell types by centrifugation with mono-poly resolving medium (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared by cell lysis with the detergent Nonidet P-40 as described by Johnson et al. (21Johnson D.R. Levanat S. Bale A.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar). All extracts were prepared in the presence of 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl flouride. The protease inhibitors leupeptin (1 μm) and aprotinin (0.3 μm) were also used in the preparation of extracts from neutrophils and monocytes. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214409) Google Scholar). The sense strand sequences of the probes are as follows: A2, (−22 to +14 bp), 5′-ATGTGGTTTCCTTATTTCCGTTTATTCATCAAGTGC-3′; M1, 5′-ATGTGGTTTAATTATTTCCGTTTATTCATCAAGTGC-3′; M2, 5′-ATGTGGTTTCCTTATTTAAGTTTATTCATCAAGTGC-3′; M3, 5′-ATGTGGTTTAATTATTTAAGTTTATTCATCAAGTGC-3′; PU.1 (CDllb promoter), 5′-GCTCAAAGAAGGGCAGAAAAGGAGAAGTAG-3′; and NS(nonspecific), 5′-CTCGCAGTGACATTAGCATTCCGGTACTGTATCGTA-3′. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′ end-labeled by polynucleotide kinase using 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN). Unincorportated [γ-32P]ATP was removed from the labeled probe with nick spin columns-Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA probes (0.5 ng) were incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extracts and 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) for 30 min at room temperature. A 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe was used for competition experiments. For supershift analyses, 2 μg of a rabbit polyclonal PU.1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or 2 μl of rabbit preimmune sera were incubated with nuclear extracts for 15 min at 4 °C before addition of probe. Binding reactions were electrophoresed on 6% acrylamide gels with 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA (4.45 mm Tris base, 4.45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) as a running buffer. Gels were dried and exposed with intensifying screens to x-ray film for 24–48 h at −70 °C. CEMT4 and NIH3T3 cells were transfected by electroporation with 15 μg of construct A2 (−126 to +86 bp), 15 μg of an expression vector encoding for murine PU.1 (CMV/pCB6+PU.1) or vector without the PU.1 cDNA (CMV/pCB6+), and 2 μg of pCMV/β-gal. DNA concentrations were adjusted to 42 μg with the CMV/pCB6+ vector. The vector pCMV/pCB6+PU.1 was generously provided by Dr. Michael Atchison (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). CXCR1 and CXCR2 are highly expressed in neutrophils and readily detected by Northern blot analysis. The short life span of neutrophils and the difficulties of transfecting these cells have precluded the use of neutrophils as a cellular system to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of neutrophil-specific genes. On the other hand, most cell lines of hematopoietic origin express trace amounts of CXCR1 or CXCR2 (23Moser B. Barella L. Mattei S. Schumacher C. Boulay F. Colombo M.P. Baggiolini M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified a myeloid cell line, 32Dcl3 (32D), that increases intracellular calcium in response to IL-8 (12Sanchez X. Hodges-Cousins B. Horton J. Navarro J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 906-910PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of murine neutrophils and 32D, NIH3T3 (3T3), CEMT4 (CEM), and RAW264.7 (RAW) cell lines revealed high levels of murine IL-8 receptor mRNA in 32D cells and neutrophils (Fig.1). The 32D cell line is a murine interleukin-3-dependent myeloid precursor cell line that differentiates into neutrophils in the presence of G-CSF (24Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we found that IL-8 and the related chemokine melanoma growth-stimulating activity suppress the proliferation of 32D cells (12Sanchez X. Hodges-Cousins B. Horton J. Navarro J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 906-910PubMed Google Scholar). Although previously it was argued that mouse and rat only express the human homolog of CXCR2, two reports have identified the human homolog of CXCR1 in rat and mouse (25Dunstan C.-A.N.

Gerard N.P. von Uexkull-Guldenband C. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Conklyn M.J. Breslow R. Showell H.J. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29355-29358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the murine 32D cell line is a suitable cellular system to identify the regulatory elements and transcription factors regulating the myeloid lineage-specific expression of the human CXCR1 gene. Previous studies showed that CXCR1 promoter constructs containing the first 800 bp of 5′-flanking DNA directed activation of the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in hematopoietic cell lines expressing negligible levels of IL-8 receptors (15Sprenger H. Lloyd A.R. Meyer R.G. Johnston J.A. Kelvin D.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2524-2532PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ahuja S.K. Shetty A. Tiffany H.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of the CXCR1 promoter for the myeloid lineage, myeloid (32D and RAW) and nonmyeloid (3T3 and CEM) cell lines were transfected with the −800 to +86 bp/luc promoter construct (A1). As shown in Fig.2, the A1 promoter construct exhibited the greatest reporter activities in 32D and RAW cell lines, 200- and 400-fold higher than the promoterless luciferase vector, respectively. In the nonmyeloid cells CEM and 3T3, the promoter activity of construct A1 was significantly lower than the activity observed in myeloid cells. Deletion of the sequence −800 to −126 bp (construct A2) increased reporter activity 2-fold relative to construct A1. This finding suggests that the sequence −800 to −126 bp contains negative promoter elements. Further deletion of the sequence −800 to −58 bp (construct A3) still exhibited high levels of promoter activity in the myeloid cells 32D and RAW. Surprisingly, the A3 construct showed higher levels of promoter activity in 3T3 cells than the A1 and A2 constructs, suggesting the presence of negative elements between −126 and −58 bp. Deletion of the −800- to +51-bp region (construct A4) abolished promoter activity. These data indicate the presence ofcis-acting elements from −126 to +51 bp that direct positive promoter activity in the myeloid cells 32D and RAW and elements from −126 to −58 bp that direct negative promoter activity in the nonhematopoietic cell line 3T3. EMSAs were performed to identify transcription factors binding to the CXCR1 promoter sequences in a myeloid-specific fashion. EMSAs were performed with 32P end-labeled DNA fragments encompassing the −58- to +50-bp sequence, because the majority of myeloid-specific promoter activity is contained in this region. Only a fragment corresponding to the sequence −22 to +14 bp (A2 probe) produced a fast-migrating, myeloid-specific complex (Fig.3). An excess of unlabeled A2 probe displaced the binding of the labeled A2 probe to the myeloid-specific factor (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 7); however, an excess of unlabeled nonspecific probe did not displace the binding of A2 probe (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and 15). A similar myeloid-specific complex was observed with the A2 probe and nuclear extracts from human neutrophils and human monocytes (data not shown). These results suggest that myeloid-specific transcription factors bind to the −22- to +14-bp fragment. Analysis of the −22 to +14 bp sequence revealed consensus binding sequences for transcription factors of theets family. PU.1 is a member of the ets family that is expressed in myeloid cells, including neutrophils and macrophages, and B cells (27Chen H.-M. Zhang P. Voso M.T. Hohaus S. Gonzalez D.A. Glass C.K. Zhang D.-E. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1995; 85: 2918-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PU.1 binds to the −22- to +14-bp sequence (probe A2), the two putative PU.1 binding sites were first mutated. Disruption of the two putative PU.1 sites (M3) or the PU.1 site proximal to the transcription start site (M2) did not displace the A2 probe bound to the myeloid-specific protein, and M3 and M2 probes did not generate the myeloid-specific complex (Fig.4). By contrast, disruption of the PU.1 site distal to the transcription start site (M1) effectively displaced the A2 probe bound to the myeloid-specific protein, and the M1 probe generated the myeloid-specific complex (Fig. 4). These findings strongly suggest that the core PU.1 binding motif is located −7 to −4 bp. Second, a fragment corresponding to the PU.1 binding site of the CD11b promoter was an effective competitor for formation of the myeloid-specific complex (Fig. 4, lanes 2–5) but not for nonmyeloid DNA-protein complexes formed with myeloid (Fig. 4,lanes 2–5) and nonmyeloid extracts (Figs. 4, lanes 6–9, and 5 A). Third, the PU.1 fragment produced a similar myeloid-specific complex as the −22- to +14-bp fragment A2 with extracts from 32D (Fig. 5 A, lane 11) and RAW (Fig. 5 A, lane 13), and A2 was an effective competitor for the formation of the PU.1 complex (Fig. 5 A, lanes 12and 14). Fourth, EMSA in the presence of antibodies that specifically recognize human and murine PU.1 produced supershifts of the myeloid-specific complexes generated with the PU.1 fragment (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 6) and the −22 to +14 bp sequence (probe A2) (Fig. 5 B, lanes 10 and 12). Fifth, Northern blot analysis revealed that PU.1 mRNA is expressed specifically in the myeloid cells 32D and RAW but not in nonmyeloid cells CEM and 3T3 (Fig. 6). These results demonstrate that the myeloid-specific complex is generated by PU.1 binding to the −22 to +14 bp fragment.Figure 5PU.1 binding to the −22- to +14-bp fragment. EMSA conditions are as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, competition analysis of A2 probe binding by PU.1 probe (lanes 1–9) and PU.1 probe binding by A2 probe (lanes 10–16).

Disruption of the PU.1 binding site abolished the promoter activity of the −126 to +86 bp/luc construct (A2) (Fig.7). This result indicates that the PU.1 site is essential for promoter activity and that compensatory elements are not present in this construct to drive the expression of the reporter gene. To directly demonstrate that PU.1 binds and activates the IL-8RA promoter, the nonmyeloid cell lines that do not express PU.1, CEM, and 3T3 were cotransfected with the −126 to +86 bp/luc construct (A2) and an expression vector encoding PU.1. Cotransfections with PU.1 cDNA increased promoter activity 4-fold in CEM cells (Fig. 8 A) and >16-fold in 3T3 cells (Fig. 8 B) compared with vector alone. These findings strongly suggest that the myeloid-specific expression of the CXCR1 gene is activated by PU.1 interacting with promoter sequences adjacent to the transcription start site.Figure 8Transactivation of the IL-8RA promoter by PU.1. CEM (A) and 3T3 (B) cells were cotransfected with the A2 construct (−126 to +86 bp) and an expression vector encoding PU.1 (PU.1/pCB6+) or vector alone (pCB6+).C, 3T3 cells were cotransfected with the A2 construct (−126 to +86 bp) and increasing concentrations of PU.1/pCB6+. Lysates were assayed for promoter activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfection with CMV/β-galactosidase plasmids. Promoter activity is reported as fold increase relative to the activity of the promoterlesss luciferase vector (pLUC). Error bars indicate the S.E. from the results of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chemokines are major regulators of the proliferation of myeloid precursor cells (12Sanchez X.

However, little is currently known about the mechanisms regulating the expression of chemokine receptors during the commitment and differentiation of progenitor cells toward myeloid lineages and neutrophil development, in particular. The restrictive expression of IL-8 receptors in myeloid precursor cells and neutrophils provides a system to identify the regulatory elements and transcription factors that may regulate the commitment of progenitor cells to the neutrophil lineage. In this study, the promoter activity of the proximal −800 bp of the CXCR1 gene was analyzed. This sequence was found to contain the regulatory elements that direct CXCR1 promoter activity in a myeloid-specific fashion. High levels of promoter activity were detected specifically in 32D (myeloid precursor cells) and RAW (macrophages). Sequences −800 to −126 bp were found to contain negative regulatory elements. This finding is in agreement with that of Sprenger et al. (15Sprenger H. Lloyd A.R. Meyer R.G. Johnston J.A. Kelvin D.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2524-2532PubMed Google Scholar), who suggested the presence of silencer elements between positions −841 and −280 bp on the basis of transfection studies with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter genes in nonmyeloid cell lines. Because most of the promoter activity is localized within the −56- to +50-bp sequence, myeloid-specific proteins binding in this region were identified. On the basis of EMSA, the transcription factor PU.1 was shown to bind the −22- to +14-bp fragment with the common GGAA binding motif at position −7 to −4 bp. Disruption of the PU.1 binding site abolished the myeloid-specific transcriptional activity of the CXCR1 promoter. Transfection of nonmyeloid cell lines CEM (T cells) and 3T3 (fibroblasts) with cDNA encoding PU.1 increased the promoter activity of the −126 to +86 bp/luc construct. Because PU.1 expression in nonmyeloid cell lines produced high levels of promoter activity, this suggests that PU.1 does not require other myeloid-specific factors for activation of the promoter construct. These data show for the first time the transcriptional regulation of a chemoattractant G protein-coupled receptor by the myeloid transcription factor PU.1. PU.1 has been shown to regulate several myeloid lineage-specific genes, including granulocyte-macrophage CSF receptor, G-CSF receptor, macrophage CSF receptor, CD11b, scavenger receptor, FcγRIIIA, FcγR1b, c-fes, interleukin-1β, myeloperoxidase, and neutrophil elastase (8Zhang D.-E.

Studies with PU.1-null mice indicate that PU.1 is necessary for normal neutrophil development (6Scott E.W. Simon C. Anastasi J. Singh H.

Neutrophils from mice deficient of PU.1 fail to terminally differentiate and are functionally incompetent. PU.1−/−mice contain neutrophils that do not respond to IL-8, indicating that functional receptors are not expressed (33Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Pio F. Torbett B.E. Maki R.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and further supporting the view that PU.1 is required for the expression of IL-8 receptors. Our studies reveal that the regulatory sequences analyzed in this study do not direct cell-specific expression, because high levels of promoter activity are demonstrated in both 32D cells, which express IL-8 receptors, and RAW cells, which do not express IL-8 receptors. Similar findings were observed with the promoter of the eosinophil-specific IL-5 receptor, in which high levels of promoter activity were obtained in both myeloid and eosinophilic cell lines (36Sun Z. Yergeau D.A. Tuypens T. Tavernier J. Paul C.C. Baumann M.A. Tenen D.G. Ackerman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1462-1471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The neutrophil lineage-specific expression of CXCR1 transcripts could possibly be attributable to post-transcriptional mechanisms or transcription factor regulatory sites located further upstream or downstream of the sequences analyzed in this study. Further experiments will be focused on mapping additional functional elements of the CXCR1 promoter and identifying the transcription factors that bind to these elements to elucidate the mechanisms regulating the neutrophil lineage-specific expression of CXCR1.

Deletion analysis revealed the 704-base pair minimal promoter region flanking the translational initiation codon, for which two distinct promoter activities were detected and differentially used in PC12 and Neuro2a cells. The minimal promoter region contained a GC-rich domain (GC content 80%), in which a Sp1 binding sequence and a GSG-like nerve growth factor-responsive element were found, but lacked TATA- and CAAT-boxes. Promoter analysis with a primary culture of DRG neurons demonstrated that the minimal promoter region of the RFT-I gene was sufficient for the expression of a reporter gene in DRG neurons.

The H antigens are rarely detected in adult nervous tissues of human and other mammals but are present on a subset of neurons. Analyses with Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 lectin, which binds to type 2 H (Fucα1,2Galβ1,4GlcNAc) determinants, and anti-H antibodies revealed that the expression of H antigens was restricted to olfactory bulb and cochlear hair cells in rats (5Mollicone R.

Most of the H-positive axons of primary sensory neurons were unmyelinated and thought to be C-fibers that mediate nociceptive or thermoceptive inputs or both. We have extended the analysis of the expression of H determinants in the mammalian nervous system using anti-fucosyl GM1 antibodies andU. europaeus agglutinin 1 lectin (10Kusunoki S. Inoue K. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Mannen T. Brain Res. 1989; 494: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11Kusunoki S. Inoue K. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Mannen T. Neurosci.

In the human and rabbit nervous systems, H antigens are abundantly expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which consist of several types of primary sensory neurons. The anti-fucosyl GM1 antibodies and U. europaeusagglutinin 1 lectin recognized a subpopulation of neurons in DRG and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The anti-fucosyl GM1 antibodies also bound to the satellite cells surrounding the fucosyl GM1-positive neurons (10Kusunoki S. Inoue K. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Mannen T. Brain Res. 1989; 494: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Kusunoki S. Inoue K. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Mannen T. Kanazawa I. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 15: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, in rabbits, the anti-fucosyl GM1 antibodies bound to the axons and the myelin of the small myelinated fibers in the dorsal root and the large neurons in the ventral horn (13Kusunoki S. Chiba A. Shimizu T. Kanazawa I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In rabbit DRG, fucosyl GM1 is readily detectable immunohistochemically on embryonic day 25, followed by the appearance of U. europaeus agglutinin 1 lectin-reactive antigens postnatally (12Kusunoki S. Inoue K. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Mannen T. Kanazawa I. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 15: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Kusunoki S. Chiba A. Shimizu T. Kanazawa I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The expression of H antigens in human and rabbit DRG neurons seems to be under similar control, although little is known about the molecular basis of their regulated expression. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the biosynthesis of H antigens in DRG neurons, we recently cloned three types of rabbit α1,2-FT gene,i.e. one H-type and two Se-type genes, as judged from the results of kinetic studies (14Hitoshi S. Kusunoki S. Kanazawa I. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8844-8850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Hitoshi S. Kusunoki S. Kanazawa I. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16975-16981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Analysis of the expression of these genes revealed that all three α1,2-FT genes were expressed in DRG of late embryonic rabbits but that only the H-type α1,2-FT gene, the RFT-I gene, was expressed postnatally (16Hitoshi S. Kusunoki S. Kanazawa I. Tsuji S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2174-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In situhybridization demonstrated that abundant RFT-I mRNA was present in adult rabbit DRG neurons of small diameter. We have shown that the RFT-I gene specifies the mRNAs of a major 3.1-kb transcript in DRG and a minor 4.2-kb transcript broadly expressed in rabbit nervous tissues. These results indicate that the 3.1-kb transcript of the RFT-I gene is under the control of DRG small neuron-specific promoter activity. In this study, we determine the genomic structure of the RFT-I gene and the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region using a primary culture of DRG neurons. Poly(A)-rich RNAs were extracted from adult rabbit DRG by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method and purified with Oligotex-dT30 (Takara-Shuzo, Japan). Amplification of the 5′-end of the RFT-I cDNA was performed essentially according to the procedure of Frothman et al. (17Frothman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription (Superscript II; Life Technologies, Inc.) of 5 μg of rabbit DRG poly(A)-rich RNA using primer H4B3, 5′-AAGCAAGAAGGCCAGACAGAGCTG-3′, which is complementary to nucleotides +45 to +22 (taking the translational initiation site as +1) of the RFT-I gene. The excess primer and deoxynucleotide were removed by passage of the cDNA through a MicroSpin S-400 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA was A-tailed with 0.6 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Boehringer Mannheim), using 0.05 mm dATP. Two consecutive PCRs were performed with two nested sets of primers; for the first PCR, the forward primer wasNotI-(dT)18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the reverse primer was H4B3; for the second PCR, the forward primer was as above but without the T-tail, 5′-AACTGGAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCAGGAA-3′, and the reverse primer was H4B4 (5′-AGAGCTGCCGGCGGCTCGGAGGCCACAT-3′; complementary to nucleotides +28 to +1). The cDNA was amplified for 40 cycles of a step program (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 30 s). The amplification products were subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) and then sequenced. For 3′-RACE, cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using (dT)18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two consecutive PCRs were performed using forward primer H4A11 (5′-TTTAACCCAGGGGCAGCACAGGGTCT-3′; nucleotides +2082 to +2107) and reverse primer NotI-(dT)18 and then using the forward primer H4A12 (5′-TGGAGTCGAGGTCCACACCTCCA-3′; nucleotides +2284 to +2306) and the above reverse primer without the T-tail. We previously reported two RFT-I mRNA transcripts, 4.2 and 3.1 kb, the latter of which is major and specific to DRG (16Hitoshi S. Kusunoki S. Kanazawa I. Tsuji S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2174-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To determine the transcription pattern of the DRG-specific mRNA isoform, we performed Northern blot analysis using three probes located in the 5′-flanking region relative to the translation initiation site. Probes A (−481 to −302), B (−294 to −55), and C (−75 to +29) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products), using a pair of synthetic oligonucleotide primers specific to each probe and Klenow fragment (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNAs (3 μg) from adult rabbit brain and DRG were fractionated on a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel (1.0%) and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran; Schleicher & Schuell). Three membranes prepared from a gel were hybridized with probe A, B, or C. To obtain various lengths of the 5′-flanking region of the RFT-I gene, pH4-SK3.6 was constructed by sequentially subcloning 2.0-kb XhoI–KpnI (nucleotides +856 to +2890) and 1.6-kb SacI–XhoI (nucleotides −707 to +856) fragments from RG11 into the pUC118 plasmid. A 0.7-kb SacI–PstI fragment was subcloned into pPicaGene-Basic II (pPGBII; Toyo-ink, Japan) to obtain pBH4-SP0.7. A 0.6-kb SacI fragment was subcloned into theSacI site of pBH4-SP0.7 to obtain pBH4-SSP1.3. A 1.6-kbBamHI–SacI fragment was subcloned into the upperSacI site of pBH4-SSP1.3 to obtain pBH4-BP3.0. Series of deletion plasmids were constructed by subcloning the restriction enzyme-digested DNA fragments. SacI–SmaI (169 bp), SmaI (325 bp), and NcoI–PstI (291 bp) fragments were subcloned into pPGBII to obtain pBH4-SSm0.2, pBH4-Sma0.3, and pBH4-NP0.3, respectively. The correct constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled BII primer (5′-AGTGCAAGTGCAGGTGCCAGAA-3′) and an A.L.F. DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pBH4-SacB8 (containing nucleotides −707 to −626) and pBH4-SacB8m (containing the same region with mutations) constructs were made by integrating the DNA fragments amplified by PCR using pBH4-SSm0.2 as a template and a pair of primers, the forward BII primer and reverse primer H4B8 (5′-TCCGGGCTCCCAGCCCCCGCCCCCAGGG-3′) or H4B8m (5′-TCCGGGCTCCCAGCCCCTGTCCCCAGGG-3′, mutations underlined), into pPGBII, respectively. The pBH4-A6Pst (containing nucleotides −257 to −4) and pBH4-A6mPst (containing the same region with mutations) constructs were made by integrating the DNA fragments amplified by PCR using pH4-SK3.6 as a template and a pair of primers, forward primer H4A6 (5′-GAGCCGGTGGGCTTGGCACGTGGGGAGG-3′) or H4A6m (5′-GAGCCGGTGGGCTTGGCAAATGGGGAGG-3′, mutations underlined) and reverse primer H4B4, into pPGBII, respectively. The DNA fragments containing the SV40 early promoter cut from pPicaGene-Control Vector II (Toyo-ink) were subcloned into pPGBII to obtain pBII-SV40. The DNA fragments containing CMV promoter cut from pRc-CMV (Invitrogen) were subcloned into pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH) to obtain pCMV-EGFP. Neuro2a and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/35-mm diameter dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum 24 h prior to transfection, respectively. PC12 cells were seeded in the same manner in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum. The luciferase plasmid (2 μg) used as a reporter and the pSR-β-gal plasmid (0.2 μg) used as an internal control for transfection efficiency were transfected into the cells by means of Lipofectoamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). As negative and positive controls, the pPGBII and pBII-SV40 plasmids, respectively, were also transfected. Plasmid pH4-SK3.6, which contains 5′-untranslated region, the entire coding region, and 3′-untranslated region with a poly(A) signal, was linearized with HindIII, combined with pTK-Hyg (CLONTECH), and then transfected into Neuro2a and PC12 cells. After culturing for 72 h, the cells were selected with 0.3 μg/ml of hygromycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and subsequently subcloned. Cultures of DRG neurons and cerebellar granule cells were obtained as follows. DRG were excised from P14 rabbits, trypsinized, treated with 0.01% DNase I and then 10 μg/ml of collagenase I (Sigma), and finally mechanically dissociated. The cell suspension was plated onto collagen S (Boehringer Mannheim)-coated coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 ng/ml of 2.5 S nerve growth factor (NGF; Sigma). Dorsal roots were also excised and treated as above to obtain fibroblasts and Schwann cells, but without DRG neurons. Cerebella excised from P5 rabbits were trypsinized and then mechanically dissociated. The cell suspension was plated onto poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips at 2–5 × 105 cells/cm2 in minimum essential medium with 26 mm potassium supplemented with 5% horse serum. After 48 h of plating, the luciferase plasmid (0.5 μg) and the pSR-β-gal plasmid (0.05 μg) were transfected into the cells by means of FuGene 6 (Boehringer Mannheim). To verify the viability of cells and actual transfection of the plasmids into DRG neurons or cerebellar granule cells, pCMV-EGFP (0.5 μg) was also transfected in another coverslip culture. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were washed three times with PBS and then lysed with cell lysis buffer (PGβ-50; Toyo-ink, Japan). Luciferase activity was measured using a PicaGene Luciferase assay system (Toyo-ink) and a Luminescencer AB-2000 (Atto, Japan). Light activity measurements were performed in duplicate, averaged, and then normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity in order to correct for the transfection efficiency. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using a Luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit (CLONTECH). Nuclear extracts from Neuro2a and PC12 cells with and without treatment with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 90 min were prepared by the method of Masuda et al. (18Masuda E.S. Tokumitsu H. Tsuboi A. Shlomai J. Hung P. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7399-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) Briefly, 5 × 107 cells were collected by centrifugation and then sequentially resuspended with buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 15 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin), buffer A containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and buffer A containing 0.2 m sucrose and centrifugation at 800 × g. The cell pellet was then resuspended with buffer D (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged. Protein concentration of supernatant was determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay. The DNA fragments of nucleotides −707 to −626 with and without mutations in the Sp1 and GSG overlapping elements were cut out withSacI and HindIII from pBH4-SacB8m and pBH4-SacB8. The synthetic DNA primers, H4A8 (5′-GGCCCTGGGGGCGGGGGCTGGGAGCCCGGA-3′) and H4B8, and H4A8m (5′-GGCCCTGGGGACAGGGGCTGGGAGCCCGGA-3′, mutations underlined) and H4B8m, were annealed to yield A8B8 and A8mB8m fragments, respectively. The DNA fragments were end-labeled with [32P]dCTP using Klenow polymerase. Binding assays were performed with a labeled probe in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 0.4 footprinting units of recombinant human Sp1 (Promega) or 0.5 μg of nuclear extracts. Binding reactions were carried out for 30 min on ice in 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 3.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Competitor fragments of a 20-fold excess amount or anti-Egr-1 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were added where indicated. After incubation, the samples were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE. The gel was run in the cold at 200 V and dried, and then the radioactivity was detected with a BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Japan). We previously showed that two RFT-I mRNA transcripts, 4.2 and 3.1 kb, were expressed in rabbit nervous tissues (16Hitoshi S. Kusunoki S. Kanazawa I. Tsuji S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2174-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The 4.2-kb transcript was broadly found in the central and peripheral nervous tissues examined but in low amounts, whereas the 3.1-kb transcript was abundantly and specifically observed in DRG neurons of small diameter. To isolate the 5′-end of the RFT-I cDNA, we performed RACE-PCR using poly(A) RNA from adult rabbit DRG, and found two transcriptional start sites, at positions −498 and −82 (Figs.1 and 2). The RACE-PCR results revealed that there are three types of mRNA transcripts; one transcript (3.1-kb mRNA in Fig. 1) started at position −82 and contained no intron, the second one (3.3-kb mRNA in Fig. 1) started at position −98 and skipped the intron of nucleotides −265 to −3, yielding an additional 3.3-kb transcript, and the last one (4.2-kb mRNA in Fig. 1) also started at position −498 but without splicing out the 3.3-kb mRNA intron sequence. We also performed 3′ RACE-PCR and found a poly(A) signal at position +2579 without an intron.Figure 2Nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the RFT-I gene.

Probe A, recognizing 3.3- and 4.2-kb mRNAs, gave weak signals at the corresponding bands in both DRG and brain RNA (Fig. 3). Probe B gave weak signals at 4.2-kb in DRG and brain RNA. Probe C hybridized to a 3.1-kb transcript in DRG RNA strongly enough to be detected on short exposure. These results showed that the 3.1-kb mRNA of the RFT-I gene was abundantly and specifically expressed in DRG and that the 3.3- and 4.2-kb mRNAs were broadly found in DRG and other nervous tissues but in low amounts. To determine the RFT-I gene promoter activity, we used three types of cells: PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells expressing rat H-blood type α1,2-FT, a counterpart of RFT-I; Neuro2a mouse neuroblastoma cells originating from the neural crest but not expressing α1,2-FT; and nonneuronal CHO cells. A series of reporter plasmids containing progressive deletions of the 5′-flanking region of the RFT-I gene fused to the promoterless luciferase gene were mixed with an internal control plasmid, pSR-β-Gal, carrying a β-galactosidase gene under the control of the SRα promoter, and then transfected into cells. The luciferase activity due to each luciferase reporter plasmid was normalized as to the β-galactosidase activity. The promoter activity was calculated relative to the SV40 promoter activity taken as 100%. pBH4-BP3.0, containing the 3.0-kb 5′-flanking sequence of the RFT-I gene (−2970 to −4), showed high levels of promoter activity when expressed in PC12 and Neuro2a cells but not in CHO cells (Fig.4). The pBH4-SP0.7 reporter plasmid also showed high promoter activity in PC12 and Neuro2a cells, although the activity was lower than that of pBH4-BP3.0. The 0.7-kb 5′-flanking region was divided into three portions, and each fragment was ligated into a pPGBII plasmid. The pBH4-SSm0.2 plasmid, containing the 0.2-kb sequence (−707 to −539), showed a substantial level of promoter activity when expressed in PC12 but not in Neuro2a cells, whereas the pBH4-NP0.3 plasmid, containing the 0.3-kb sequence (−294 to −4), showed a level of promoter activity comparable with pBH4-SP0.7 in Neuro2a cells but not in PC12 cells. pBH4-Sma0.3 showed little promoter activity in both types of cells. These results suggested that the promoter activity was differentially regulated in PC12 and Neuro2a cells. To determine the effect of the differential promoter activity on the transcriptional pattern, plasmid pH4-SK3.6, containing the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions and the entire coding region of the RFT-I gene, was stably transfected into Neuro2a and PC12 cells. The transcriptional pattern was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR using three pairs of primers; the H4A5 and H4B4 primers could discriminate the presence of a 3.3-kb mRNA, the H4A5 and H4B5 (5′-GGAGGAGGTCTGGGAAAAGAGGCG-3′) primers could detect a 4.2-kb mRNA, and the H4A4 and H4B4 primers could detect 3.1- and 4.2-kb mRNAs but could not discriminate them. All pairs of primers gave positive bands when RNA from Neuro2a cell-derived stable transfectants with pH4-SK3.6 was analyzed (data not shown), indicating the presence of 3.3- and 4.2-kb transcripts of the RFT-I gene in these cells, although this result did not exclude the possibility of the presence of a 3.1-kb transcript. On the contrary, a positive band was amplified only by the H4A4 and H4B4 primers in PC12 cell-derived stable transfectants with pH4-SK3.6 (data not shown), showing the presence of a 3.1-kb transcript of the RFT-I gene. A data base search for possible binding of transcription factors revealed several Sp1 binding sites and a N-Myc binding site in the region of nucleotides −707 to −4. Among possible Sp1 binding sites, one (nucleotides −650 to −638) showed the highest homology to the consensus sequence and overlapped a GSG (GCGGGGCG)-like motif (nucleotides −645 to −637). To determine whether or not these elements were functional, we constructed plasmids pBH4-SacB8 (containing nucleotides −707 to −626) and pBH4-SacB8m (the same region with mutations) and transfected them into PC12 cells. PC12 cells transfected with pBH4-SacB8 and treated with 100 ng/ml of NGF for 48 h showed 2-fold higher luciferase activity than those without NGF (Fig.5 A). The mutations in the Sp1 and GSG overlapping domain decreased the luciferase activity and abolished the effect of NGF treatment. We then examined whether or not a possible N-Myc binding site (nucleotides −244 to −233) found within the pBH4-NP0.3 construct could be demonstrated functionally. We constructed plasmids pBH4-A6Pst (containing nucleotides −264 to −4) and pBH4-A6mPst (the same region with mutations), and transfected them into Neuro2a cells. The pBH4-A6Pst and pBH4-A6mPst constructs showed comparable promoter activities when transfected into Neuro2a cells (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that the N-Myc was not a major factor for the activity. To confirm the actual binding of Sp1 to the putative Sp1 binding site between nucleotides −650 and −638, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In the mobility shift experiments involving the DNA fragments of nucleotides −707 to −626, recombinant Sp1 bound to the DNA fragments (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). The shifted band completely disappeared in the presence of the nonlabeled specific competitor (DNA fragments from −707 to −626, the same as the labeled probe; Fig. 6 A,lane 3) and partially disappeared in the presence of the same region of the DNA fragments with mutations (lane 4). Recombinant Sp1 did not bind to the labeled probe of the DNA fragments from −707 to −626 with mutations. To determine the transcriptional factors that regulate the specific promoter activity of this region in PC12 but not in Neuro2a cells, we next performed the assay using nuclear protein extracts of Neuro2a and PC12 cells with and without NGF treatment. When nuclear protein extracts of Neuro2a and PC12 cells were used, the labeled DNA fragment of nucleotides −655 to −626 (A8B8) appeared as two shifted bands with apparently the same electromobility (Fig. 6 B,lanes 2–4, bands a andc). An additional band (band b) was observed when using a nuclear extract of PC12 cells treated with NGF for 90 min, and this shifted band disappeared upon the addition of the anti-Egr-1 polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 6 B, lane 7). All shifted bands completely disappeared in the presence of the nonlabeled specific competitor (A8B8, lane 5) but were not abolished by the mutant competitor (A8mB8m, the same region of the DNA fragments with mutations; lane 6). No shifted band was found when using the labeled DNA fragment of nucleotide −655 to −626 with mutations (A8mB8m) and nuclear protein extracts of Neuro2a and PC12 cells. DRG neurons were cultured and transfected with reporter plasmids containing several lengths of the 5′-flanking region of the RFT-I gene. The pBH4-SP0.7 construct showed the highest level of promoter activity when expressed in DRG neurons (Fig. 7), which was consistent with the results for PC12 and Neuro2a cells. However, the pBH4-SSP1.3, pBH4-SSm0.2, and pBH4-NP0.3 constructs showed relatively low promoter activities. The DRG culture contained neurons, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts, and all of them were transfected with plasmids and expressed the reporter gene, as revealed by the transfection of pCMV-EGFP and observation by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). To determine the contributions of Schwann cells and fibroblasts to the promoter activity, we then used a dorsal root culture, which contained Schwann cells and fibroblasts but no neurons. All of the constructs showed a relatively low level of promoter activity (Fig. 7), suggesting that the high promoter activity of the pBH4-SP0.7 construct could be due to the expression of the reporter gene in DRG neurons. Next, we determined whether or not the promoter activity of the pBH4-SP0.7 construct was specific to DRG neurons. The pBH4-SP0.7 and other constructs showed lower promoter activity when expressed in cerebellar granule cells, another type of neuron, than in DRG neurons (Fig. 7). We previously showed that the expression of RFT-I is strictly regulated spatially and temporary in the rabbit nervous system and abundant in adult DRG neurons of small diameter (16Hitoshi S. Kusunoki S. Kanazawa I. Tsuji S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2174-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the genomic organization and promoter activity that regulates the DRG neuron-specific expression of t"
