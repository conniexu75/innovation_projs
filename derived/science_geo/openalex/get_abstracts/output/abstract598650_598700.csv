We describe the multi-platform molecular landscape of 206 adult soft tissue sarcomas representing 6 major types. Along with novel insights into the biology of individual sarcoma types, we report three overarching findings: (1) unlike most epithelial malignancies, these sarcomas (excepting synovial sarcoma) are characterized predominantly by copy-number changes, with low mutational loads and only a few genes (TP53, ATRX, RB1) highly recurrently mutated across sarcoma types; (2) within sarcoma types, genomic and regulomic diversity of driver pathways defines molecular subtypes associated with patient outcome; and (3) the immune microenvironment, inferred from DNA methylation and mRNA profiles, associates with outcome and may inform clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Overall, this large-scale analysis reveals previously unappreciated sarcoma-type-specific changes in copy number, methylation, RNA, and protein, providing insights into refining sarcoma therapy and relationships to other cancer types."

Disrupting the BTB is therefore highly desirable but complicated by the need to maintain the normal blood-brain barrier (BBB).

These findings highlight the clinical potential of targeting neoplastic pericytes to significantly improve treatment of brain tumors. Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal brain tumor resistant to current therapies. Despite significant advances in cancer treatment, there has been little improvement in the prognosis of GBM patients over decades (Chinot et al., 2014Chinot O.L. Wick W. Mason W. Henriksson R. Saran F. Nishikawa R. Carpentier A.F. Hoang-Xuan K. Kavan P. Cernea D. et al.Bevacizumab plus radiotherapy-temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.N. Engl. J.

Neurooncol. 2014; 117: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This striking failure could be ascribed to multiple factors, but the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) represents a formidable obstacle. As a filtering barrier of capillaries, the BTB and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevent most anti-cancer agents from penetrating GBM tumors and limit therapeutic efficacy (Fellner et al., 2002Fellner S. Bauer B. Miller D.S. Schaffrik M. Fankhänel M. Spruss T. Bernhardt G. Graeff C. Färber L. Gschaidmeier H. et al.Transport of paclitaxel (Taxol) across the blood-brain barrier in vitro and in vivo.J.

Therapeutic efficacy of multiagent chemotherapy with drug delivery enhancement by blood-brain barrier modification in glioblastoma.Neurosurgery. 1986; 19: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The BTB and BBB exclude most compounds except highly lipidized small molecules of less than 400 Daltons, rendering potentially powerful anti-cancer drugs impotent for GBM treatment (Pardridge, 2002Pardridge W.M. Drug and gene targeting to the brain with molecular Trojan horses.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Thus, breaking the BTB or BBB will significantly affect GBM treatment. However, because the BBB serves as an indispensable vascular barrier to protect the normal brain by blocking entry of harmful materials (Bergers and Song, 2005Bergers G. Song S. The role of pericytes in blood-vessel formation and maintenance.Neuro-oncol. 2005; 7: 452-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar), abnormal breakdown of the BBB could result in neuronal degenerative changes or diseases (Bell et al., 2010Bell R.D. Winkler E.A. Sagare A.P. Singh I. LaRue B. Deane R. Zlokovic B.V. Pericytes control key neurovascular functions and neuronal phenotype in the adult brain and during brain aging.Neuron. 2010; 68: 409-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Thus, it is crucial to selectively disrupt the BTB in GBM tumors while sparing the BBB in normal brain tissues during chemotherapy. The BBB and BTB are composed of several components, including tight junctions, vessel basement membranes, and astrocyte endfeet that cover endothelial cells to form a physical barrier (Watkins et al., 2014Watkins S. Robel S. Kimbrough I.F. Robert S.M. Ellis-Davies G. Sontheimer H. Disruption of astrocyte-vascular coupling and the blood-brain barrier by invading glioma cells.Nat.

Astrocytic laminin regulates pericyte differentiation and maintains blood brain barrier integrity.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Besides, molecular effusion through endothelial cells is actively regulated by transcytosis, the vesicular transport of macromolecules across cells (Shue et al., 2008Shue E.H. Carson-Walter E.B. Liu Y. Winans B.N. Ali Z.S. Chen J. Walter K.A.

Neurosci. 2015; 18: 978-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Despite their similarities, the BBB and BTB differ in many aspects. The BTB is formed by highly proliferative, morphologically abnormal tumor capillaries (Pries et al., 2010Pries A.R. Höpfner M. le Noble F. Dewhirst M.W. Secomb T.W. The shunt problem: control of functional shunting in normal and tumour vasculature.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, Verbeek et al., 1994Verbeek M.M. Otte-Höller I. Wesseling P. Ruiter D.J. de Waal R.M. Induction of alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in cultured human brain pericytes by transforming growth factor-beta 1.Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 372-382PubMed Google Scholar). These tumor vessels may have aberrant expression of transcytotic proteins (Strickland et al., 2005Strickland L.A. Jubb A.M. Hongo J.A. Zhong F. Burwick J. Fu L. Frantz G.D. Koeppen H. Plasmalemmal vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP) is expressed by tumour endothelium and is upregulated by vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF).J. Pathol. 2005; 206: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, perivascular components, such as astrocytic endfeet on tumor vessels, are altered (Watkins et al., 2014Watkins S. Robel S. Kimbrough I.F. Robert S.M. Ellis-Davies G. Sontheimer H. Disruption of astrocyte-vascular coupling and the blood-brain barrier by invading glioma cells.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). These facts suggest a possibility to selectively disrupt the BTB in the tumor without affecting the BBB in normal brain tissue, which will enhance delivery of poor BTB-penetrating but potent anti-cancer drugs into brain tumors to improve chemotherapy efficacy but limit the unwanted toxicity to the normal brain. Vascular pericytes that attach to endothelial cells play a pivotal role in maintaining the BBB. Pericyte depletion disrupted the BBB and elevated vascular permeability in Pdgfb knockout mice (Armulik et al., 2010Armulik A. Genové G. Mäe M. Nisancioglu M.H. Wallgard E. Niaudet C. He L. Norlin J. Lindblom P. Strittmatter K. et al.Pericytes regulate the blood-brain barrier.Nature. 2010; 468: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, Daneman et al., 2010Daneman R. Zhou L. Kebede A.A. Barres B.A. Pericytes are required for blood-brain barrier integrity during embryogenesis.Nature. 2010; 468: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). Consistent with the essential functions of pericytes in maintaining the BBB, loss of pericytes has been observed in brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and ischemia, which is believed to exacerbate the diseases (Hall et al., 2014Hall C.N. Reynell C. Gesslein B. Hamilton N.B. Mishra A. Sutherland B.A. O’Farrell F.M. Buchan A.M. Lauritzen M. Attwell D. Capillary pericytes regulate cerebral blood flow in health and disease.Nature. 2014; 508: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar, Sagare et al., 2013Sagare A.P. Bell R.D. Zhao Z. Ma Q. Winkler E.A. Ramanathan A. Zlokovic B.V. Pericyte loss influences Alzheimer-like neurodegeneration in mice.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in GBM tumors, the majority of vascular pericytes are derived from glioma stem cells (GSCs) through transdifferentiation (Cheng et al., 2013Cheng L. Huang Z. Zhou W. Wu Q. Donnola S. Liu J.K. Fang X. Sloan A.E. Mao Y. Lathia J.D. et al.Glioblastoma stem cells generate vascular pericytes to support vessel function and tumor growth.Cell. 2013; 153: 139-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). These GSC-derived pericytes bear tumor-specific genetic alterations that distinguish them from normal pericytes (Cheng et al., 2013Cheng L. Huang Z. Zhou W. Wu Q. Donnola S. Liu J.K. Fang X. Sloan A.E. Mao Y. Lathia J.D. et al.Glioblastoma stem cells generate vascular pericytes to support vessel function and tumor growth.Cell. 2013; 153: 139-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), indicating a possibility to selectively target these neoplastic pericytes. However, the functional significance of GSC-derived pericytes in maintaining the structure and function of the BTB in GBMs remains elusive. This study aims to determine the role of GSC-derived pericytes in BTB maintenance and the effects of genetic and pharmacological targeting of tumor pericytes on vascular permeability, drug delivery, and chemotherapy efficacy. Because the majority of neoplastic pericytes in GBM tumors originate from GSCs, these pericytes likely share some essential molecular signatures with GSCs. Among the multiple regulators critical for GSC maintenance, we identified the bone marrow and X-linked (BMX) non-receptor tyrosine kinase to be highly expressed in GSC-derived pericytes but not in normal pericytes in the brain. BMX is a member of the Tec tyrosine kinase family (Saharinen et al., 1997Saharinen P. Ekman N. Sarvas K. Parker P. Alitalo K. Silvennoinen O. The Bmx tyrosine kinase induces activation of the Stat signaling pathway, which is specifically inhibited by protein kinase Cdelta.Blood. 1997; 90: 4341-4353PubMed Google Scholar). BMX kinase can be activated by multiple signaling pathways and several chemokines, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, ErbB3, and integrins (Chen et al., 2001Chen R. Kim O. Li M. Xiong X. Guan J.L. Kung H.J. Chen H. Shimizu Y. Qiu Y. Regulation of the PH-domain-containing tyrosine kinase Etk by focal adhesion kinase through the FERM domain.Nat.

Biol. 2002; 22: 7512-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). BMX is highly expressed in multiple cancers and contributes to cell transformation, proliferation, and resistance to therapies (Dai et al., 2010Dai B. Chen H. Guo S. Yang X. Linn D.E. Sun F. Li W. Guo Z. Xu K. Kim O. et al.Compensatory upregulation of tyrosine kinase Etk/BMX in response to androgen deprivation promotes castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 5587-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, Guo et al., 2007Guo L.

Expression of tyrosine kinase Etk/Bmx and its relationship with AP-1- and NF-kappaB-associated proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma.Oncology. 2007; 72: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We found that BMX is preferentially expressed in GSCs and activates STAT3 to maintain the self-renewal and tumorigenic potential of GSCs (Guryanova et al., 2011Guryanova O.A. Wu Q. Cheng L. Lathia J.D. Huang Z. Yang J. MacSwords J. Eyler C.E. McLendon R.E.

Interestingly, we and others detected BMX expression in the perivascular regions (Ekman et al., 1997Ekman N. Lymboussaki A. Västrik I. Sarvas K. Kaipainen A. Alitalo K. Bmx tyrosine kinase is specifically expressed in the endocardium and the endothelium of large arteries.Circulation. 1997; 96: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Guryanova et al., 2011Guryanova O.A.

Because GSCs are able to differentiate into pericytes but not endothelial cells (Cheng et al., 2013Cheng L. Huang Z. Zhou W. Wu Q. Donnola S. Liu J.K. Fang X. Sloan A.E. Mao Y. Lathia J.D. et al.Glioblastoma stem cells generate vascular pericytes to support vessel function and tumor growth.Cell. 2013; 153: 139-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), GSC-derived pericytes may maintain BMX expression. In this study, we found that BMX is also highly expressed in GSC-derived pericytes, which makes selective targeting and pharmacological inhibition of neoplastic pericytes possible. Importantly, the kinase activity of BMX could be inhibited by ibrutinib (PCI-32765), an inhibitor initially developed to inhibit Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) but showed a similar affinity to BMX (Honigberg et al., 2010Honigberg L.A. Smith A.M. Sirisawad M. Verner E. Loury D. Chang B. Li S. Pan Z. Thamm D.H. Miller R.A. Buggy J.J. The Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor PCI-32765 blocks B-cell activation and is efficacious in models of autoimmune disease and B-cell malignancy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ibrutinib has been used clinically to effectively treat lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia by targeting BTK (Bernard et al., 2015Bernard S. Goldwirt L. Amorim S. Brice P. Brière J. de Kerviler E. Mourah S. Sauvageon H. Thieblemont C.

Med. 2015; 21: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Moreover, ibrutinib has been shown to penetrate the BBB (Bernard et al., 2015Bernard S. Goldwirt L. Amorim S. Brice P. Brière J. de Kerviler E. Mourah S. Sauvageon H. Thieblemont C. Activity of ibrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma patients with central nervous system relapse.Blood. 2015; 126: 1695-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Lionakis et al., 2017Lionakis M.S.

Therefore, there is significant clinical potential in repurposing ibrutinib for BMX inhibition to target GSC-derived pericytes for selective disruption of the BTB. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic effect of targeting neoplastic pericytes on BTB disruption to enhance drug delivery into GBM tumors. We investigated the potential relationship between vascular pericyte coverage and the survival of GBM patients treated with chemotherapy. In an orthotopic GBM model, we demonstrated that selective targeting of GSC-derived pericytes potently disrupted BTB tight junctions and increased vascular permeability to enhance drug effusion into GBM tumors. Importantly, we found that inhibition of BMX by ibrutinib in vivo potently disrupted tumor vascular pericytes, selectively impaired the BTB but not the BBB, and enhanced delivery of poor BTB-penetrating drugs into tumors to inhibit malignant growth. Our preclinical studies identified ibrutinib as a BTB-disrupting drug that can synergize with poor BTB-penetrating anti-cancer drugs to improve chemotherapy efficacy for GBM patients. Because high pericyte coverage is associated with low vascular permeability, we speculated that the degree of pericyte coverage in GBM tumors may affect drug delivery in chemotherapy. We initially examined the potential link between pericyte coverage in GBM specimens and the survival of patients treated with or without chemotherapy. Immunofluorescent staining of α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a tumor pericyte marker that is expressed in vascular pericytes in brain tumors and smooth muscle cells on extracranial vessels (Armulik et al., 2011Armulik A. Genové G. Betsholtz C. Pericytes: developmental, physiological, and pathological perspectives, problems, and promises.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21: 193-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar), and the endothelial cell (EC) marker CD31 in human primary GBMs revealed that pericyte coverage (pericyte density/EC density) on tumor vessels varies across GBM specimens (Figures 1A; Figure S1A). To explore the potential association of pericyte coverage and chemotherapy efficacy, we examined pericyte coverage in a cohort of human GBM specimens (Table S1) and investigated its correlation with the survival of GBM patients treated with or without chemotherapy. Pericyte coverage in each GBM was determined by immunohistochemical staining of the tumor pericyte marker α-SMA and the EC marker CD34, which labels ECs better than CD31 in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor sections (Figures 1B; Figures S1B and S1C). GBM patients were stratified into high and low pericyte coverage groups by using the average value of pericyte coverage of all examined GBMs as a threshold. Statistical analysis confirmed a significant difference in tumor pericyte coverage between these two groups of GBMs (Figure S1D). We then determined whether pericyte coverage correlates with the patient’s response to chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses revealed an inverse correlation between pericyte coverage and the overall survival and progression-free survival of GBM patients treated with chemotherapy (n = 40) (Figures 1C and 1D). However, in the group of GBM patients without chemotherapy (n = 26), pericyte coverage showed no significant correlation with prognosis (Figures 1E and 1F). In addition, regression analyses further confirmed a significant inverse correlation between pericyte coverage and the prognosis of GBM patients treated with chemotherapy (Figure 1G), but such correlation was not significant in GBM patients without chemotherapy (Figure 1H). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the extent of pericyte coverage in GBM is inversely associated with patient response to chemotherapy, suggesting that neoplastic pericytes in GBM may regulate the BTB to affect the efficiency of drug delivery. Next we addressed whether targeting neoplastic pericytes disrupts the BTB to increase vascular permeability in GBM xenografts. Our previous study demonstrated that the majority of vascular pericytes in GBM tumors are derived from GSCs (Cheng et al., 2013Cheng L. Huang Z. Zhou W. Wu Q. Donnola S. Liu J.K. Fang X. Sloan A.E. Mao Y. Lathia J.D. et al.Glioblastoma stem cells generate vascular pericytes to support vessel function and tumor growth.Cell. 2013; 153: 139-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HsvTK) targeting system (Culver et al., 1992Culver K.W. Ram Z. Wallbridge S. Ishii H. Oldfield E.H. Blaese R.M. In vivo gene transfer with retroviral vector-producer cells for treatment of experimental brain tumors.Science. 1992; 256: 1550-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar) with the Desmin promoter-driven HsvTK (DesPro-HsvTK) (Figure 2A) to selectively eliminate the GSC-derived pericytes in GBM xenografts upon ganciclovir (GCV) treatment (Cheng et al., 2013Cheng L. Huang Z. Zhou W. Wu Q. Donnola S. Liu J.K. Fang X. Sloan A.E. Mao Y. Lathia J.D. et al.Glioblastoma stem cells generate vascular pericytes to support vessel function and tumor growth.Cell. 2013; 153: 139-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Briefly, sorted GSCs were transduced with DesPro-HsvTK and then transplanted into the brains of immunocompromised mice. Mice bearing the tumors were then treated with GCV to selectively eliminate GSC-derived pericytes expressing HsvTK. We used this selective targeting system to investigate whether elimination of GSC-derived pericytes alters vascular permeability in intracranial GBM xenografts. Twenty days after implantation of the GSCs transduced with DesPro-HsvTK or the DesPro-Vec control, mice were confirmed to have similarly sized tumors and then treated with GCV for 3–5 days. Because long-term depletion of GSC-derived pericytes by GCV treatment severely disrupted vessels (Cheng et al., 2013Cheng L. Huang Z. Zhou W. Wu Q. Donnola S. Liu J.K. Fang X. Sloan A.E. Mao Y. Lathia J.D. et al.Glioblastoma stem cells generate vascular pericytes to support vessel function and tumor growth.Cell. 2013; 153: 139-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), we tested whether short-term GCV treatment could largely eliminate GSC-derived pericytes but preserve vessels. GCV treatment for 4 days reduced pericyte coverage from 80% to 10% but retained vessels, as measured by co-staining of the pericyte marker Desmin and the endothelial marker Glut1 in xenografts derived from GSCs (T4121 and CCF2045) transduced with DesPro-HsvTK (Figures S2A and S2B). However, vessel density was not affected by short-term GCV treatment (Figures S2A and S2C). Then we performed the same experimental procedure followed by tail vein injection of fluorescent tracers to examine vascular permeability (Figure 2B). Cadaverine is a small molecular (1 kDa) fluorescent tracer commonly used to measure the integrity of the BBB or BTB and thus serves as an indicator of vascular permeability in vivo (Armulik et al., 2010Armulik A. Genové G. Mäe M. Nisancioglu M.H. Wallgard E. Niaudet C. He L. Norlin J. Lindblom P. Strittmatter K. et al.Pericytes regulate the blood-brain barrier.Nature. 2010; 468: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, Watkins et al., 2014Watkins S. Robel S. Kimbrough I.F. Robert S.M. Ellis-Davies G. Sontheimer H. Disruption of astrocyte-vascular coupling and the blood-brain barrier by invading glioma cells.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Two hours after cadaverine injection, mice were sacrificed, and the intracranial tumors were analyzed for cadaverine effusion. Selective targeting of GSC-derived pericytes significantly elevated (>40 fold) cadaverine effusion into tumors derived from GSCs transduced with DesPro-HsvTK but not into the matched normal brain tissue (Figures 2C and 2D; Figures S2D and S2E), whereas cadaverine effusion was negligible in tumors derived from the GSCs transduced with DesPro-Vec after GCV treatment. However, targeting GSC-derived pericytes did not increase the entry of a large fluorescent tracer dextran (10 kDa) into tumors (Figures 2E and 2F). Furthermore, we found that the effusion of a tracer of 3 kDa was slightly increased, whereas tracers larger than 3 kDa were impeded from entering the tumor mass (Figures 2E and 2F; Figures S2F–S2I). Importantly, the elevated tracer effusion was detected only in tumor tissues but not in the matched normal brain tissues after targeting GSC-derived pericytes (Figures 2C–2F), suggesting a selective disruption of the BTB but not the BBB. These results demonstrate that selective disruption of GSC-derived pericytes significantly increases vascular permeability, allowing for efficient effusion of small molecules. Thus, selective targeting of GSC-derived pericytes may specifically disrupt the BTB and facilitate drug delivery into GBM tumors to improve chemotherapy efficacy. We next investigated the effect of disrupting GSC-derived pericytes on BTB integrity in tumor vessels. The BBB or BTB contains several components, including tight junctions, vessel basement membranes, and astrocyte endfeet. In addition, transcytosis across endothelial cells may regulate the BBB or BTB. Vascular tight junctions block the free exchange/diffusion of materials between vessels and the surrounding tissues (Tietz and Engelhardt, 2015Tietz S. Engelhardt B. Brain barriers: Crosstalk between complex tight junctions and adherens junctions.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and thus provide the fundamental structural basis for the BBB or BTB. Through immunofluorescence staining of two tight junction markers, ZO-1 and Occludin, we found that disruption of GSC-derived pericytes severely impaired tight junctions (Figures 3A and 3B ; Figures S3A and S3B). Less than 5% of tumor vessels marked by CD31 staining had tight junctions after elimination of GSC-derived pericytes (Figures 3C and 3D; Figures S3C and S3D). In contrast, the tight junctions were intact in control xenografts without pericyte disruption (Figures 3A and 3B; Figures S3A and S3B). More than 60% of tumor vessels were positive for ZO-1 and Occludin in control xenografts (Figures 3C and 3D; Figures S3C and S3D). Moreover, transmission electron microscopy demonstrated loss of tight junction structures between endothelial cells on tumor vessels in xenografts after disruption of GSC-derived pericytes (Figure 3E), but disruption of neoplastic pericytes did not alter tight junctions on vessels in matched normal brain tissue (Figure 3E). These data indicate that disruption of GSC-derived pericytes caused a significant loss of tight junctions and affected BTB integrity. Next we examined whether targeting GSC-derived pericytes affects other BTB components (Figures S3E–S3H and S4). Surprisingly, disruption of GSC-derived pericytes had little effect on the vascular basement membrane according to immunofluorescent staining of the vascular basement membrane marker Laminin (Figures S3E, S3F, S4A, and S4B). Likewise, expression of Plvap, which associated with endothelial vesicle transport and the BBB or BTB transcytosis (Shue et al., 2008Shue E.H. Carson-Walter E.B. Liu Y. Winans B.N. Ali Z.S. Chen J. Walter K.A. Plasmalemmal vesicle associated protein-1 (PV-1) is a marker of blood-brain barrier disruption in rodent models.BMC Neurosci. 2008; 9: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was not changed in the xenografts after disruption of GSC-derived pericytes (Figures S3G, S3H, S4C, and S4D), indicating unchanged endothelial transcytosis after pericyte disruption in the tumors. Of note, Plvap was not detect"

https://openalex.org/W2765737423,"Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are heterogeneous tumors sustained by tumor-propagating cancer cells (TPCs). SCCs frequently resist chemotherapy through still unknown mechanisms. Here, we combine H2B-GFP-based pulse-chasing with cell-surface markers to distinguish quiescent from proliferative TPCs within SCCs. We find that quiescent TPCs resist DNA damage and exhibit increased tumorigenic potential in response to chemotherapy, whereas proliferative TPCs undergo apoptosis. Quiescence is regulated by TGF-β/SMAD signaling, which directly regulates cell-cycle gene transcription to control a reversible G1 cell-cycle arrest, independent of p21CIP function. Indeed, genetic or pharmacological TGF-β inhibition increases the susceptibility of TPCs to chemotherapy because it prevents entry into a quiescent state. These findings provide direct evidence that TPCs can reversibly enter a quiescent, chemoresistant state and thereby underscore the need for combinatorial approaches to improve treatment of chemotherapy-resistant SCCs."
https://openalex.org/W2765123285,"The quiescence of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) is regulated by local parvalbumin (PV) interneurons within the dentate gyrus (DG). Little is known about how local PV interneurons communicate with distal brain regions to regulate NSCs and hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we identify GABAergic projection neurons from the medial septum (MS) as the major afferents to dentate PV interneurons. Surprisingly, dentate PV interneurons are depolarized by GABA signaling, which is in sharp contrast to most mature neurons hyperpolarized by GABA. Functionally, these long-range GABAergic inputs are necessary and sufficient to maintain adult NSC quiescence and ablating them leads to NSC activation and subsequent depletion of the NSC pool. Taken together, these findings delineate a GABAergic network involving long-range GABAergic projection neurons and local PV interneurons that couples dynamic brain activity to the neurogenic niche in controlling NSC quiescence and hippocampal neurogenesis."

ANG is known to be internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and undergo cell-type- and context-specific differential subcellular localization. Under growth conditions and in differentiated cells, ANG is translocated to the nucleus and stimulates rRNA transcription, thereby promoting cell growth and proliferation. Under stress conditions or in primitive cells, ANG is translocated to stress granules (SGs) and mediates production of tRNA-derived stress-induced small RNA (tiRNA), which reprograms protein synthesis by suppressing global protein translation to save anabolic energy while permitting internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation (Ivanov et al., 2011Ivanov P. Emara M.M. Villen J. Gygi S.P. Anderson P. Angiogenin-induced tRNA fragments inhibit translation initiation.Mol. Cell. 2011; 43: 613-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), a mechanism that is often used by anti-apoptotic genes. Thus, the cell surface receptor is essential for ANG to exert its biological activities and is a promising target for ANG-related therapies (Di Scala and Hidalgo, 2016Di Scala M. Hidalgo A. Angiogenin Defines Heterogeneity at the Core of the Hematopoietic Niche.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 284-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). However, the identity of this receptor remains unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that plexin-B2 (PLXNB2) is both necessary and sufficient to mediate the biological activities of ANG in physiologically, pathologically, and therapeutically relevant cell types, including endothelial, cancer, neuronal, and normal and malignant stem and progenitor cells. We show that PLXNB2 mediates cellular activities of ANG, including nuclear translocation, SG localization, rRNA transcription, tiRNA production, AKT and ERK phosphorylation, and Rac and Cdc42 activation, as well as cell growth, stem cell self-renewal, survival, and regenerative capabilities. Further, we establish that modulation of ANG-PLXNB2 activities is therapeutically relevant in a number of pathological conditions, including solid and blood cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and hematopoietic regeneration. ANG was originally identified as a tumor angiogenic factor (Fett et al., 1985Fett J.W. Strydom D.J. Lobb R.R. Alderman E.M. Bethune J.L. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Isolation and characterization of angiogenin, an angiogenic protein from human carcinoma cells.Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5480-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were thus extensively used in previous attempts for identification of ANG receptors. However, this strategy has been unproductive, as the receptor in endothelial cells is downregulated when cell density increases (Hu et al., 1997Hu G.F. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. A putative angiogenin receptor in angiogenin-responsive human endothelial cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As ANG was also found to stimulate LNCaP proliferation in the absence of androgen (Li et al., 2013Li S. Hu M.G. Sun Y. Yoshioka N. Ibaragi S. Sheng J. Sun G. Kishimoto K. Hu G.F. Angiogenin mediates androgen-stimulated prostate cancer growth and enables castration resistance.Mol. Cancer Res. 2013; 11: 1203-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we used LNCaP as the target cells and found that 125I-ANG binds to LNCaP cells specifically (Figure 1A) with a Kd of 0.45 nM (Figure 1B). Affinity chromatography on ANG-Sepharose revealed a prominent band with apparent MW of ∼175 kDa (Figure 1C). This band did not appear in the eluate from a non-affinity Sepharose column, and its abundance was reduced when the sample was pre-incubated with free ANG, indicating that it is specific for ANG. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 15 peptides were matched to human PLXNB2 (Figure 1D). PLXNB2, originally identified from malignant brain tumors (Shinoura et al., 1995Shinoura N. Shamraj O.I. Hugenholz H. Zhu J.G. McBlack P. Warnick R. Tew J.J. Wani M.A. Menon A.G.

PLXNB2 expression is widespread during development, but is more restricted in adult tissues—mainly neural stem cells (Saha et al., 2012Saha B. Ypsilanti A.R. Boutin C. Cremer H. Chédotal A.

RT-PCR showed that PLXNB2 expression is density-dependent in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) but density-independent in LNCaP cells (Figure 1E), consistent with the observation that the activity of ANG in HUVEC is density-dependent (Hu et al., 1997Hu G.F.

Immunofluorescence (IF) confirmed that PLXNB2 is expressed on LNCaP cell surface (Figure 1F). Meta-analysis of publicly available array experiments shows that PLXNB2 level in neoplasm is significantly higher (p < 10−10) than in normal tissues, cells, and other diseases (Figure S1A). Overproduction of PLXNB2 protein in various human cancers (Figures S1B–S1D) and in mouse tumors (Figures S1E and S1F) was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlates with significantly reduced median survival in patients with prostate cancer (Figure S1G), glioma (Figure S1H), and breast cancer (Figure S1I).Figure S1Upregulation of PLXNB2 Expression in Cancers, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Meta-analysis of PLXNB2 expression from 206 public available arrays of 5,732 samples containing 369 different cell and tissue types.(B) IHC detection of PLXNB2 protein in human prostate cancer (PaC), benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and normal prostate tissues.(C) High-magnification images of PLXNB2 in human PaC and normal prostate tissues.

Low and high PLXNB2 levels were divided at median. Statistical analyses of Kaplan-Meier survival curves were done by long rank tests (Graphpad Prism). To obtain biochemical evidence that ANG indeed binds to PLXNB2, we expressed the Sema domains of PLXNB2, purified it to homogeneity (Figure S2A), and examined its interaction with ANG by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and found that ANG binds to PLXNB2 with an apparent Kd of 0.74 nM (Figure 1G) and a steady-state Kd of 2.87 nM (Figure S2B). No appreciable binding was detected between ANG and the Sema domain of PLXNB1 (Figure S2C) or PLXNB3 (Figure S2D) by SPR. These results show that ANG binds to PLXNB2 specifically with a Kd in nM range. ELISA analyses also showed that ANG binds to both Sema domain and extracellular domain (ECD) of PLXNB2, but not to that of PLXNB3 (Figure 1H). Ribonuclease 4 (RNASE4), a homologous protein of ANG, did not bind to PLXNB2 or PLXNB3 (Figure 1I). Co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) demonstrated association of ANG with PLXNB2 in vivo (Figure 1J). Knockdown of PLXNB2 expression in LNCaP cells (Figure 1K) abolished specific binding of ANG to cell surface (Figure S2E), inhibited nuclear translocation of ANG (Figure 1L), and abolished ANG-induced cell proliferation (Figure 1M), AKT and ERK phosphorylation, and 47S rRNA transcription (Figure 1N). PLXNB2 knockdown also inhibited ANG-mediated tiRNA production (Figure 1O) and abolished the protective activity of ANG against starvation-induced apoptosis (Figure 1P). It is notable that ∼30% of tiRNA remained in PLXNB2 knockdown cells, probably due to the residual PLXNB2 expressed in these cells. PLXNB2 knockdown in PC3 (Figure S3A) and DU145 (Figure S3B) cells also resulted in decreased nuclear translocation of ANG (Figures S3C and S3D) and reduced cell proliferation (Figures S3E and S3F). Further, we observed reduced proliferation in glioblastoma cells (Figures S3F and S3G), breast cancer cells (Figures S3I and S3J), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells (Figure S3K) following PLXNB2 knockdown. Together, these data demonstrate that PLXNB2 is necessary for the biological activities of both endogenous and exogenous ANG in multiple cancer cell lines. Ectopic expression of human PLXNB2 in COS-7 cells, which express a low level of endogenous monkey PlxnB2 (Figure 2A), enabled nuclear translocation of ANG (Figure 2B) and AKT phosphorylation (Figure 2C) upon ANG stimulation in these originally ANG-unresponsive cells. We found that ANG bound to the surface of PLXNB2 transfectants of COS-7 at 4°C (Figure S4A) and underwent nuclear translocation at 37°C (Figure S4B). Ectopic expression of PLXNB1 and PLXNB3 in COS-7 cells (Figure 2D) did not enable nuclear translocation of ANG (Figure 2E). Moreover, biotinylated ANG bound to COS-7 cells transfected with PLXNB2, but not to those transfected with PLXNB1 and PLXNB3 (Figure 2F). Together, these results indicate that PLXNB2 is a specific and functional receptor for ANG and is both necessary and sufficient to mediate the biological functions of ANG.Figure S4Identification of ANG-Binding Site on PLXNB2, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) ANG was incubated with vector or PLXNB2 transfectants of COS-7 cells at 4°C (A) or 37°C (B) for 1 h.

To identify the ANG-binding site on PLXNB2, serial deletion mutants were prepared and transfected into COS-7 cells, and the ability of these transfectants to mediate nuclear translocation of ANG was examined. Deletion of the Sema domain eliminated nuclear translocation of ANG (Figure 2G), whereas deletion of plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) and/or Ig-like, plexins, transcription factots (IPT) domains had no effect. Further serial deletions were examined, and the putative ANG-binding site was identified to be located between residues 334 and 449 (Figure S4C). Then, a series of peptides of 15 amino acids covering this region were synthesized, and their binding capacity to ANG was examined by equilibrium dialysis (Figure 2H), differential spectrum (Figure 2I), and ELISA (Figure 2J). Among the peptides examined, only hplb2-15-06 showed appreciable binding to ANG in all three assays. Next, we attempted to determine which one of the three functional sites of ANG is responsible for PLXNB2 binding. ANG has a receptor binding site, a catalytic center, and a nuclear localization sequence. Mutations at the receptor binding site of ANG (R66A and N68D) abolished binding to this peptide, but mutations at the catalytic center (H13A) had no effect (Figure 2J). These results indicate that the receptor binding site of ANG is where PLXNB2 binds. We next examined the inhibitory activity of hplb2-15-06 toward ANG and found that it inhibited nuclear translocation of ANG, as did the Sema domain (Figure 2K), and inhibited ANG-induced angiogenesis (Figure 2L). The peptide from the adjacent sequence (hplb2-15-05) did not bind ANG (Figures 2H–2J) and did not inhibit ANG activity (Figures 2K and 2L). These results demonstrate that the ANG-binding site on PLXNB2 is located within hplb2-15-06 at amino acid residues 424–441 with a sequence of GTSSEYDSILVEINKRVK (Figure S4D). It is notable that the sequence of this binding site is only present in PLXNB2 and not conserved in PLXNB1 and PLXNB3 (Figure S4E) (Janssen et al., 2010Janssen B.J. Robinson R.A. Pérez-Brangulí F. Bell C.H. Mitchell K.J. Siebold C. Jones E.Y. Structural basis of semaphorin-plexin signalling.Nature. 2010; 467: 1118-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of PLXNB1, the ANG-binding site on PLXNB2 consists of the end of sixth blade (β6d) and part of the loop that connects the seventh blade (Figure S4E). Since the ANG-binding site on PLXNB2 is located on a beta-sheet strand and a linker loop with low steric constraints, we reasoned that a synthetic peptide containing this sequence could serve as an antigen to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that would bind to PLXNB2 and blocks ANG binding to the same site. Indeed, mAbs generated using hplb2-15-06 as the immunogen bind both the synthetic peptide (Figure S5A) and the ECD (Figure S5B) and Sema domain (Figure S5C) of PLXNB2. A commercial mAb of PLXNB2 did not bind to the small peptide but did bind to the ECD and Sema domains. These mAbs inhibited ANG-induced LNCaP cell proliferation with an IC50 ranging from 4 to 16 μg/mL (Figure S5D). Among them, mAb17 has the lowest IC50 and was thus used in subsequent experiments. First, we confirmed binding between PLXNB2 and mAb17 biochemically by SPR and determined the binding affinity to be 8.3 × 10−14 M (Figure 3A). Second, we performed flow cytometry analysis of LNCaP cells and showed that mAb17 binds to the surface of live cells (Figure 3B). Functionally, we showed that at 30 μg/mL, mAb17 completely blocked nuclear translocation of ANG under growth conditions (Figure 3C) and SG localization under stress (Figure 3D) and abolished angiogenic activity of both ANG and VEGF (Figure 3E), as we have shown before that ANG-mediated rRNA transcription is required for VEGF to induce angiogenesis (Kishimoto et al., 2005Kishimoto K. Liu S. Tsuji T. Olson K.A. Hu G.F. Endogenous angiogenin in endothelial cells is a general requirement for cell proliferation and angiogenesis.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Proliferation of solid and hematopoietic cancer cells was also inhibited by mAb17, including GBM (Figure S5K) and prostate (Figures 3F, S5D, and S5E), breast (Figures S5F and S5G), and myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells (Figures S5H–S5J). mAb17 had no effect on proliferation following doxycycline-induced, shRNA-mediated knockdown of PLXNB2 in U87 cells (Figure S5K). Quantitative flow cytometry analysis showed that these mAb17-responsive cells express considerable amount of PLXNB2 (Table S1). Even though a correlation between PLXNB2 expression and responsiveness to mAb17 could not be established, we found that treatment with mAb17 resulted in downregulation of PLXNB2 in MCF7 cells (Figure S5L) and led to upregulation of pro-apoptotic transcripts and downregulation of pro-survival transcripts in U87 cells (Figure S5M).Figure 3Monoclonal Antibodies of the ANG-Binding Site of PLXNB2 Inhibited Biological Activities of ANG and Tumor GrowthShow full caption(A) Binding of mAb17 on PLXNB2 analyzed by SPR.(B) Binding of mAb17 on LNCaP cell surface analyzed by flow cytometry.(C) mAb17 inhibited nuclear translocation of ANG in LNCaP cells under growth conditions.

Our results suggest that antisense TE transcription is a “trap” that elicits an endosiRNA response to restrain acute transposon activity during epigenetic reprogramming in the mammalian germline. Epigenetic reprogramming in the mammalian germline is key for restoration of developmental potency and occurs at the preimplantation stage of embryonic development and during development of primordial germ cells (PGCs) (Reik and Surani, 2015Reik W. Surani M.A. Germline and pluripotent stem cells.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7: a019422Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These events lead to global DNA methylation and H3K9me2 erasure together with the transient transcriptional activation of specific classes of transposable elements (TEs) (Hajkova et al., 2008Hajkova P. Ancelin K. Waldmann T. Lacoste N. Lange U.C. Cesari F. Lee C. Almouzni G. Schneider R.

Dynamic control of endogenous retroviruses during development.Virology. 2011; 411: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This raises fundamental questions about the regulation of TE defense in the absence of repressive epigenetic marks. TEs comprise ∼50% of the mammalian genome and can be categorized into two major classes: retrotransposons and DNA transposons (Lander et al., 2001Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M. FitzHugh W. et al.International Human Genome Sequencing ConsortiumInitial sequencing and analysis of the human genome.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17763) Google Scholar). While most TEs in the genome are inactive due to mutations and/or truncations, around 1%–2% of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) remain able to retrotranspose (Maksakova et al., 2006Maksakova I.A. Romanish M.T. Gagnier L. Dunn C.A. van de Lagemaat L.N. Mager D.L. Retroviral elements and their hosts: insertional mutagenesis in the mouse germ line.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Notably, the ERV family members intracisternal A particles (IAPs) and early transposons (ETns) are the most active TEs in the murine germline (Maksakova et al., 2006Maksakova I.A. Romanish M.T. Gagnier L. Dunn C.A. van de Lagemaat L.N. Mager D.L. Retroviral elements and their hosts: insertional mutagenesis in the mouse germ line.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Due to their ability to retrotranspose, TEs are thought to play an important role in genome evolution, but can also cause genetic diseases (Goodier and Kazazian, 2008Goodier J.L. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Retrotransposons revisited: the restraint and rehabilitation of parasites.Cell. 2008; 135: 23-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In order to protect the genome from harmful mutations, regulatory mechanisms must be in place to limit their transcription. TE activity is controlled by multiple epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, repressive histone modifications, and small RNAs (Rowe and Trono, 2011Rowe H.M. Trono D. Dynamic control of endogenous retroviruses during development.Virology. 2011; 411: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In somatic tissues, DNA methylation and H3K9me2/3 have been shown to be responsible for TE silencing (Walsh et al., 1998Walsh C.P. Chaillet J.R. Bestor T.H. Transcription of IAP endogenous retroviruses is constrained by cytosine methylation.Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 116-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, Hutnick et al., 2010Hutnick L.K. Huang X. Loo T.-C. Ma Z. Fan G. Repression of retrotransposal elements in mouse embryonic stem cells is primarily mediated by a DNA methylation-independent mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 21082-21091Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, in the germline, DNA methylation and H3K9me2 are globally erased, while H3K9me3 is maintained and H3K27me3 is redistributed (Iurlaro et al., 2017Iurlaro M. von Meyenn F. Reik W.

Dietmann S. Surani M.A. Specification and epigenetic programming of the human germ line.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17: 585-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Indeed, deletion of the H3K9me3 methyltransferase Setdb1 leads to activation of IAPs during PGC development as well as in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Karimi et al., 2011Karimi M.M. Goyal P. Maksakova I.A. Bilenky M. Leung D. Tang J.X. Shinkai Y. Mager D.L. Jones S. Hirst M. Lorincz M.C.

Retroviral elements and their hosts: insertional mutagenesis in the mouse germ line.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Further, global demethylation of naive ESCs results in transcriptional activation of TEs and subsequent resilencing by a redistribution of repressive histone marks (Walter et al., 2016Walter M. Teissandier A. Pérez-Palacios R. Bourc’his D. An epigenetic switch ensures transposon repression upon dynamic loss of DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells.eLife. 2016; 5: e11418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies have demonstrated that small RNAs may also act post-transcriptionally as a second-tier defense against TEs, particularly in the germline. In mouse oocytes, microRNAs (miRNAs) and endogenous short interfering RNAs (endosiRNAs) that control TE expression have been identified (Tam et al., 2008Tam O.H. Aravin A.A. Stein P. Girard A. Murchison E.P. Cheloufi S. Hodges E. Anger M. Sachidanandam R. Schultz R.M. Hannon G.J.

Cell. 2008; 31: 785-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). In ESCs, tRNA fragments have been recently described to play a role in ERV translational control (Schorn et al., 2017Schorn A.J. Gutbrod M.J. LeBlanc C. Martienssen R. LTR-retrotransposon control by tRNA-derived small RNAs.Cell. 2017; 170: 61-71.e11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In contrast to somatic cells, increased pervasive transcription across TEs was reported in ESCs, suggesting that TEs may regulate transcription of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) (Kelley and Rinn, 2012Kelley D. Rinn J. Transposable elements reveal a stem cell-specific class of long noncoding RNAs.Genome Biol. 2012; 13: R107Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, however, in yeast it was shown that genome-wide pervasive transcription antisense to transposons leads to an RNAi response as a defense mechanism against TEs (Cruz and Houseley, 2014Cruz C. Houseley J. Endogenous RNA interference is driven by copy number.eLife. 2014; 3: e01581Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Sense/antisense transcription permits the production of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggering RNAi (Fire et al., 1998Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Potent and specific genetic interference by double-stranded RNA in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11769) Google Scholar), which has also been identified as a control mechanism of TEs (Robert et al., 2005Robert V.J.P. Sijen T. van Wolfswinkel J. Plasterk R.H.A. Chromatin and RNAi factors protect the C. elegans germline against repetitive sequences.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here we test the hypothesis that genic transcripts antisense to TEs serve as a trap for transcriptional activation of TEs during global demethylation in mammals. Generation of Dicer as well as Ago2 conditional and constitutive knockout ESC lines in the background of a Dnmt1 conditional knockout (cKO) line allowed us to define an “immediate” endosiRNA-dependent repressive response to TE activation and a subsequent “chronic” response, characterized by targeting of repressive histone modifications. Our experimental system recapitulates epigenetic reprogramming of early embryos and PGCs in vitro. We used Cre-mediated conditional Dnmt1 deletion in ESCs (Dnmt1 cKO) (Sharif et al., 2016Sharif J. Endo T.A. Nakayama M. Karimi M.M. Shimada M. Katsuyama K. Goyal P. Brind’Amour J. Sun M.A. Sun Z. et al.Activation of endogenous retroviruses in Dnmt1(-/-) ESCs involves disruption of SETDB1-mediated repression by NP95 binding to hemimethylated DNA.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 81-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and sampled DNA and RNA at several defined time points after Dnmt1 deletion for methylome, long and small transcriptome, and chromatin analyses (Figure 1A). By whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS-seq), we confirmed that acute deletion of Dnmt1 led to genome-wide demethylation from an initial 85% CpG methylation to 35% at day 3 after deletion, and 20% at day 6 after deletion with no further demethylation thereafter (Figures 1B and S1A). The residual methylation can be attributed to the activity of the de novo DNA methyltransferases (Lei et al., 1996Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Jüttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. De novo DNA cytosine methyltransferase activities in mouse embryonic stem cells.Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon Dnmt1 cKO, loss of methylation was observed in genic and intergenic elements, CGIs, and non-CGI promoters (Figure 1B). Characteristic methylation profiles over gene bodies were reduced with the same kinetics as the rest of the genome upon Dnmt1 cKO (Figure S1B). Furthermore, low methylated regions (LMRs) (Stadler et al., 2011Stadler M.B. Murr R. Burger L. Ivanek R. Lienert F. Schöler A. van Nimwegen E. Wirbelauer C. Oakeley E.J. Gaidatzis D. et al.DNA-binding factors shape the mouse methylome at distal regulatory regions.Nature. 2011; 480: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar) and active enhancers became demethylated (Figure S1C). Thus, this in vitro model results in replication-dependent global demethylation of the genome, which closely resembles the dynamics of global reprogramming in early embryos and PGCs (von Meyenn et al., 2016von Meyenn F. Iurlaro M. Habibi E. Liu N.Q. Salehzadeh-Yazdi A. Santos F. Petrini E. Milagre I. Yu M. Xie Z. et al.Impairment of DNA methylation maintenance is the main cause of global demethylation in naive embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cell. 2016; 62: 848-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To analyze TEs in WGBS-seq, RNA-seq, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq data, we only considered uniquely mapped reads and filtered out TEs overlapping the (± 2 kb) region surrounding genes. While unique mapping might not capture all information about young TEs (as they lack the increased sequence divergence of older TEs that makes unique mapping more efficient; Lerat et al., 2003Lerat E. Rizzon C. Biémont C. Sequence divergence within transposable element families in the Drosophila melanogaster genome.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 1889-1896PubMed Google Scholar), this conservative approach allows us to be confident that mapped reads can be definitively ascribed to specific TE subfamilies. Moreover, the filtering of the region (± 2 kb) surrounding genes avoids ambiguity about the origin of TE expression from promoters that are not their own (Figure S1D; Data S1). Acute Dnmt1 deletion led to hypomethylation of TEs at the same rate as the rest of the genome (Figures 1B and S1E), with the exception of IAPs, RLTRs, and MMERVK10C, which preserved higher methylation levels (Figure S1F). Thus, our experimental system also closely recapitulates global demethylation dynamics of TEs in vivo, including the fact that IAPs are relatively resistant to global demethylation (Seisenberger et al., 2012Seisenberger S. Andrews S. Krueger F. Arand J. Walter J. Santos F. Popp C. Thienpont B. Dean W. Reik W. The dynamics of genome-wide DNA methylation reprogramming in mouse primordial germ cells.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 849-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, Kobayashi et al., 2013Kobayashi H. Sakurai T. Miura F. Imai M. Mochiduki K. Yanagisawa E. Sakashita A. Wakai T. Suzuki Y. Ito T. et al.High-resolution DNA methylome analysis of primordial germ cells identifies gender-specific reprogramming in mice.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Next, we performed total RNA-seq upon acute Dnmt1 deletion to examine if demethylation led to transcriptional activation of TEs. Transcriptional activation was limited to specific classes of ERVs (Figure 1C). We found TEs with increased transcription upon hypomethylation that remained active over the whole time course (MMERVK10C), as well as TEs initially activated but notably subsequently re-silenced (e.g., IAPs and MERVLs). In addition to TEs, a small number of genes became activated upon loss of DNA methylation (Figures S1G and S1H), including the imprinted genes Xlr3a, Mirg, and Rian (Table S1), consistent with the known roles for methylation in regulation of these genes (Ferguson-Smith, 2011Ferguson-Smith A.C. Genomic imprinting: the emergence of an epigenetic paradigm.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) (Figure S1I). DNA hypomethylation did not result in ESC differentiation, as indicated by the unaltered expression of the core pluripotency network (Figure S1J). Interestingly, when quantifying reads overlapping with genes, we found upon global hypomethylation increased pervasive transcription in the antisense orientation to those genes (Figure 1D). These pervasive antisense transcripts are in fact produced by transcription of TEs that have integrated in an antisense orientation to the genes (Figure 1E). Consistent with previous studies, high numbers of TEs were found to be preferentially integrated in antisense orientation to genes (van de Lagemaat et al., 2006van de Lagemaat L.N. Medstrand P. Mager D.L. Multiple effects govern endogenous retrovirus survival patterns in human gene introns.Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R86Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Figure S1K). We next analyzed the total RNA-seq data to determine whether both sense and antisense transcription was detectable at sites of TE integration. Indeed, TE antisense transcription was found in all TE families, with sense transcripts of members of the ERVs being upregulated consistent with their activation in response to demethylation (Figure 1F). We also included TEs that were not activated by hypomethylation, but instead are regulated in a DICER-dependent manner (Figure 3E). The production of sense and antisense transcripts across TEs is expected to lead to dsRNAs, which can subsequently induce an RNAi response and silence TEs post-transcriptionally. These results suggest that TE expression may be sensed by pervasive antisense transcription, thus constituting a TE “trap” (Figure 2A). To test this hypothesis, we performed small RNA-seq at defined time points after Dnmt1 deletion. The majority of small RNAs were miRNAs (Figures S2A–S2C) and were expressed independently of DNA methylation, with the exception of miRNAs from the imprinted Dlk and Xlr3 loci (Figures S2D and S2E). Small RNA quantitative real-time PCR of mature miRNAs confirmed their methylation-dependent regulation (Figure S2F). The Dlk locus serves as an example of the genome-wide response to acute Dnmt1 deletion with the imprint control region (ICR) becoming demethylated, leading to transcriptional upregulation of the imprinted locus and embedded miRNAs (Figure S2G). Due to the short reads in small RNA-seq, we used TE consensus sequence mapping to analyze global TE-derived small RNAs. This method allows unambiguous alignment to unique TE classes. Notably, we observed a substantial increase of small RNAs mapping to IAP, MERVL, and ETn upon Dnmt1 deletion (Figure 2B), which in the case of IAPs mapped across the whole length of the element (Figure 2C). Small RNAs mapping to L1MdGf and MMERVK10C were detected both in wild-type (WT) and Dnmt1 cKO ESCs, respectively (Figure 2B). The mammalian ARGONAUTE proteins (AGO) are critical components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). AGO2 can bind miRNAs as well as endosiRNAs and has the ability to “slice” its targets (Doi et al., 2003Doi N. Zenno S. Ueda R. Ohki-Hamazaki H. Ui-Tei K. Saigo K. Short-interfering-RNA-mediated gene silencing in mammalian cells requires Dicer and eIF2C translation initiation factors.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We performed AGO2 IP from Dnmt1 cKO ESCs at day 9 after deletion and analyzed the pull-down by small RNA-seq (Figure 2D). The AGO2 IP small RNA-seq libraries of both WT and Dnmt1 cKO ESCs were composed 90% of known miRNAs, while 40% of the remaining small RNAs mapped to TEs (Figure S2H, Dnmt1 cKO shown). This subset of AGO2-bound small RNAs was 22 nt long and mapped to sense and antisense strands of TEs (Figure 2E); the small RNAs had 5′ U overhangs (Figure S2I) and formed characteristic 5′-5′ overlaps at nucleotide 20, identifying them as bona fide endosiRNAs (Figure S2J) (Ghildiyal and Zamore, 2009Ghildiyal M. Zamore P.D. Small silencing RNAs: an expanding universe.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). AGO2-bound endosiRNAs mapping to MERVL and RLTR45 were expressed throughout the time course while endosiRNAs mapping to L1, IAP, and ETn or MMERVK10C were significantly enriched upon Dnmt1 deletion (Figure 2F), suggesting that functional endosiRNAs against specific TE classes are generated during global demethylation. We also generated small RNA-seq libraries of male and female PGCs from embryonic day (E)13.5 and E14.5 embryos and found that ∼10% of all 20–24 nt small RNAs mapped to TEs in both male and female E13.5 and E14.5 PGCs, with small RNAs mapping to IAPEZ and L1MdGf particularly enriched in E14.5 PGCs (Figures S2K and S2L). These small RNAs had the defining properties of endosiRNAs (Figures S2M–S2O), suggesting that a similar response to the one we discovered in ESCs exists during global demethylation in the germline in vivo. To investigate whether the observed endosiRNAs were involved in restraining TE expression, we knocked down key components of the endosiRNA and miRNA pathways in Dnmt1 cKO and monitored IAP expression by quantitative real-time PCR. Upon knockdown of Dicer or Ago2, both essential components of the RNAi pathway, IAP transcription was strongly upregulated, while knockdown of Dgcr8 (dispensable for endosiRNA function) had no effect on IAP expression (Figure 3A). This suggests that TEs are controlled by functional endosiRNAs. To examine the role of the RNAi pathway during global hypomethylation in more detail, we generated conditional Dicer/Dnmt1 cDKO (conditional double-knockout) ESCs (Figure S3A) and carried out a number of quality controls. Loss of Dicer activity was confirmed by loss of expression of mmu-miR-93, while Dicer-independent small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) were still expressed (Figure S3A). We generated total RNA-seq data from Dicer/Dnmt1 cDKO ESCs and found increased antisense transcripts in these cells, as seen earlier in the Dnmt1 cKO ESCs (Figure S3B). Furthermore, small RNA-seq of Dicer/Dnmt1 cDKO ESCs showed a depletion of all miRNAs (Figure S3C) and a loss of 21–24 nt small RNAs mapping to all TEs as well as specifically to L1MdGf and IAPEz (Figures 3B and S3D), which proves that the described small RNAs are DICER-dependent products. Acute conditional deletion of both Dicer and Dnmt1 together resulted in significantly higher levels of transcription of IAPs by day 10 in comparison to those in Dnmt1 cKO ESCs (Figure 3C). Importantly, there was no notable resilencing of IAP transcripts in Dicer/Dnmt1 cDKO. This demonstrates that DICER plays a role in the re-repression of IAPs upon global hypomethylation. LINEs and major satellites (non-TE pericentric repeats), while not upregulated upon Dnmt1 deletion, were also dramatically upregulated following Dicer deletion (Figure 3C). Dicer/Dnmt1 cDKO ESCs started to show signs of cell death from day 12 after deletion, potentially as a result of TE mobilization, as has been shown in constitutive Dicer KO (Bodak et al., 2017Bodak M. Cirera-Salinas D. Yu J. Ngondo R.P. Ciaudo C. Dicer, a new regulator of pluripotency exit and LINE-1 elements in mouse embryonic stem cells.FEBS Open Bio. 2017; 7: 204-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We next asked whether deletion of RNAi components downstream of DICER would lead to a similar response and generated conditional Ago2/Dnmt1 cDKO ESCs (Figure S3E). While we initially expected that Ago2/Dnmt1 cDKO might show comparable results to the Dicer/Dnmt1 cDKO, we found that the deletion kinetics of Ago2 KO were substantially slower than those of Dicer KO (Figures S3F and S3G). Surprisingly, however, we found that transcriptional upregulation of TEs in the Ago2/Dnmt1 cDKO was considerably blunted (Figure 3D). To gain deeper insights into the blunted TE expression, we constitutively deleted Ago2 or Dicer using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in the background of Dnmt1 cKO ESCs (Figures S3H–S3J). We first determined the effect of Dicer KO on genic and transposon transcription and were able to identify TEs that were solely dependent on DICER for their silencing, such as L1MdGf (Figures 3E and S3K–S3O). We next performed a time course of Dnmt1 deletion in Ago2 KO/Dnmt1 cKO and in Dicer KO/Dnmt1 cKO and measured IAP expression by quantitative real-time PCR. Notably, we found substantially attenuated upregulation of IAPs upon Dnmt1 deletion in both ESC lines, which was confirmed by total RNA-seq (Figures 3D and S3O). These results indicate that, in addition to DNA methylation and RNAi, alternative TE silencing mechanisms can be recruited. While DICER-dependent mechanisms restrict the expression of specific TE classes upon deletion of Dnmt1, ablation of the RNAi pathway prior to demethylation triggers the engagement of another silencing mechanism. Since repressive histone marks have been shown to contribute to TE repression in somatic tissues and in ESCs (Karimi et al., 2011Karimi M.M. Goyal P. Maksakova I.A. Bilenky M. Leung D. Tang J.X.

To study the involvement of chromatin in TE regulation upon global hypomethylation, we carried out ChIP-seq analyses of the repressive histone marks H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 at 4 and 8 days after deletion of Dnmt1, i.e., before and after transcriptional upregulation of the relevant TE classes. Genome-wide distribution of the repressive histone marks—H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3—confirmed earlier studies (Iurlaro et al., 2017Iurlaro M. von Meyenn F. Reik W.

Additionally, H3K27me3 was enriched in promoter regions but depleted at transcription start sites (TSSs) (Figures S4B and S4C). Upon Dnmt1 deletion, neither of these repressive histone marks were redistributed genome-wide (Figure S4D). However, DICER-independent MERVLs showed increased H3K27me3 deposition upon Dnmt1 deletion, recapitulating what has been reported in naive hypomethylated ESCs (Walter et al., 2016Walter M.

An epigenetic switch ensures transposon repression upon dynamic loss of DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells.eLife. 2016; 5: e11418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 4A). We found H3K9me3 enrichment across IAPs independent of DNA methylation levels, confirming previous results (Figures S4E and S4F) (Walter et al., 2016Walter M. Teissandier A. Pérez-Palacios R.

Importantly, H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 deposition was found on IAPs 9 days after Dnmt1 deletion, explaining why early, but not late, depletion of Dicer or Ago2 results in sustained TE expression. These results show that two repressive pathways are in place to control TE expression in ESCs (Figure S4I), and importantly, that they are staggered in time, with an “immediate” RNAi response and a subsequent “chronic” chromatin response.

https://openalex.org/W2766258897,"Introduction Autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders are characterized by aberrant changes in innate and adaptive immunity that may lead from an initial inflammatory state to an organ specific damage. These disorders possess heterogeneity in terms of affected organs and clinical phenotypes. However, despite the differences in etiology and phenotypic variations, they share genetic associations, treatment responses and clinical manifestations. The mechanisms involved in their initiation and development remain poorly understood, however the existence of some clear similarities between autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders indicates variable degrees of interaction between immune-related mechanisms. Methods Our study aims at contributing to a holistic, pathway-centered view on the inflammatory condition of autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. We have evaluated similarities and specificities of pathway activity changes in twelve autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders by performing meta-analysis of publicly available gene expression datasets generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using a bioinformatics pipeline that integrates Self Organizing Maps and Pathway Signal Flow algorithms along with KEGG pathway topologies. Results and conclusions The results reveal that clinically divergent disease groups share common pathway perturbation profiles. We identified pathways, similarly perturbed in all the studied diseases, such as PI3K-Akt, Toll-like receptor, and NF-kappa B signaling, that serve as integrators of signals guiding immune cell polarization, migration, growth, survival and differentiation. Further, two clusters of diseases were identified based on specifically dysregulated pathways: one gathering mostly autoimmune and the other mainly autoinflammatory diseases. Cluster separation was driven not only by apparent involvement of pathways implicated in adaptive immunity in one case, and inflammation in the other, but also by processes not explicitly related to immune response, but rather representing various events related to the formation of specific pathophysiological environment. Thus, our data suggest that while all of the studied diseases are affected by activation of common inflammatory processes, disease-specific variations in their relative balance are also identified."

Nine researchers with varying degrees of osteological and geometric morphometric knowledge landmarked ten iterations of each scan (40 total) to test the effects of scan quality, researcher experience, and landmark type on levels of intra- and interobserver error. Two researchers additionally landmarked ten specimens from seven different macaque species using the same landmark protocol to test the effects of the previously listed variables relative to species-level morphological differences (i.e., observer variance versus real biological variance). Error rates within and among researchers by scan type were calculated to determine whether or not data collected by different individuals or on different digitally rendered crania are consistent enough to be used in a single dataset. Results indicate that scan type does not impact rate of intra- or interobserver error. Interobserver error is far greater than intraobserver error among all individuals, and is similar in variance to that found among different macaque species. Additionally, experience with osteology and morphometrics both positively contribute to precision in multiple landmarking sessions, even where less experienced researchers have been trained in point acquisition. Individual training increases precision (although not necessarily accuracy), and is highly recommended in any situation where multiple researchers will be collecting data for a single project."
https://openalex.org/W2765937161,"During differentiation and development, cell fate and identity are established by waves of genetic reprogramming. Although the mechanisms are largely unknown, during these events, dynamic chromatin reorganization is likely to ensure that multiple genes involved in the same cellular functions are coregulated, depending on the nuclear environment. In this study, using high-content screening of embryonic fibroblasts from a β-actin knockout (KO) mouse, we found major chromatin rearrangements and changes in histone modifications, such as methylated histone (H)3-lysine-(K)9. Genome-wide H3K9 trimethylation-(Me)3 landscape changes correlate with gene up- and down-regulation in β-actin KO cells. Mechanistically, we found loss of chromatin association by the Brahma-related gene (Brg)/Brahma-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex subunit Brgl in the absence of β-actin. This actin-dependent chromatin reorganization was concomitant with the up-regulation of sets of genes involved in angiogenesis, cytoskeletal organization, and myofibroblast features in β-actin KO cells. Some of these genes and phenotypes were gained in a β-actin dose-dependent manner. Moreover, reintroducing a nuclear localization signal-containing β-actin in the knockout cells affected nuclear features and gene expression. Our results suggest that, by affecting the genome-wide organization of heterochromatin through the chromatin-binding activity of the BAF complex, β-actin plays an essential role in the determination of gene expression programs and cellular identity.—Xie, X., Almuzzaini, B., Drou, N., Kremb, S., Yousif, A., Östlund Farrants, A.-K., Gunsalus, K., Percipalle, P. β-Actin-dependent global chromatin organization and gene expression programs control cellular identity.

https://openalex.org/W2766166931,"Several severe stressful situations, e.g., natural disaster, infectious disease out break, and mass casualty, are known to cause anxiety, depression and cognitive impairment, and preventive intervention for these stress complications is worth exploring. We have previously reported that the serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine, as well as voluntary wheel running are effective in the treatment of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in stressed rats. But whether they are able to prevent deleterious consequences of restraint stress in rats, such as anxiety/depression-like behaviors and memory impairment that occur afterward, was not known. Herein, male Wistar rats were pre-treated for 4 weeks with anti-anxiety/anti-depressive drugs, agomelatine and venlafaxine, or voluntary wheel running, followed by 4 weeks of restraint-induced stress. During the stress period, rats received neither drug nor exercise intervention. Our results showed that restraint stress induced mixed anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and memory impairment as determined by elevated plus-maze, elevated T-maze, open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST), and Morris water maze (MWM). Both pharmacological pre-treatments and running successfully prevented the anxiety-like behavior, especially learned fear, in stressed rats. MWM test suggested that agomelatine, venlafaxine, and running could prevent stress-induced memory impairment, but only pharmacological treatments led to better novel object recognition behavior and positive outcome in FST. Moreover, western blot analysis demonstrated that venlafaxine and running exercise upregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus. In conclusion, agomelatine, venlafaxine as well as voluntary wheel running had beneficial effects, i.e., preventing the restraint stress-induced anxiety/depression-like behaviors and memory impairment."

The cognitive miserliness hypothesis proposes that people often respond incorrectly on CRT items because of an unwillingness to go beyond default, heuristic processing and invest time and effort in analytic, reflective processing. Our analysis (N = 391) focused on people's response times to CRT items to determine whether predicted associations are evident between miserly thinking and the generation of incorrect, intuitive answers. Evidence indicated only a weak correlation between CRT response times and accuracy. Item-level analyses also failed to demonstrate predicted response-time differences between correct analytic and incorrect intuitive answers for two of the three CRT items. We question whether participants who give incorrect intuitive answers on the CRT can legitimately be termed cognitive misers and whether the three CRT items measure the same general construct."

Heart rate, oxygen saturation, FiO2 and mean airway pressure from a data acquisition system were recorded every 2 seconds. Results were averaged over 30 seconds and the differences analyzed using two-tailed t-test. Interventions analyzed included time to first change in FiO2, first positive pressure ventilation, first increase in airway pressure, and first intubation.There were no significant differences in time to clinical interventions between the blinded and unblinded group, despite the unblinded group having access to a visible heart rate at 66 +/- 20 compared to 114 +/- 39 seconds for the blinded group (p < .0001). Pulse rate from oximeter was lower than EKG heart rate during the first 2 minutes of life, but this was not significant.EKG provides an earlier, and more accurate heart rate than pulse rate from an oximeter during stabilization of preterm infants, allowing earlier intervention. All interventions were started earlier in the unblinded EKG group but these numbers were not significant in this small trial. Earlier EKG placement before pulse oximeter placement may affect other interventions, but this needs further study."
https://openalex.org/W2765829445,"Visual complexity is relevant for many areas ranging from improving usability of technical displays or websites up to understanding aesthetic experiences. Therefore, many attempts have been made to relate objective properties of images to perceived complexity in artworks and other images. It has been argued that visual complexity is a multidimensional construct mainly consisting of two dimensions: A quantitative dimension that increases complexity through number of elements, and a structural dimension representing order negatively related to complexity. The objective of this work is to study human perception of visual complexity utilizing two large independent sets of abstract patterns. A wide range of computational measures of complexity was calculated, further combined using linear models as well as machine learning (random forests), and compared with data from human evaluations. Our results confirm the adequacy of existing two-factor models of perceived visual complexity consisting of a quantitative and a structural factor (in our case mirror symmetry) for both of our stimulus sets. In addition, a non-linear transformation of mirror symmetry giving more influence to small deviations from symmetry greatly increased explained variance. Thus, we again demonstrate the multidimensional nature of human complexity perception and present comprehensive quantitative models of the visual complexity of abstract patterns, which might be useful for future experiments and applications."
https://openalex.org/W2766545511,"Clathrins are cytoplasmic proteins that play essential roles in endocytosis and other membrane traffic pathways. Upon recruitment to intracellular membranes, the canonical clathrin triskelion assembles into a polyhedral protein coat that facilitates vesicle formation and captures cargo molecules for transport. The triskelion is formed by trimerization of three clathrin heavy-chain subunits. Most vertebrates have two isoforms of clathrin heavy chains, CHC17 and CHC22, generating two clathrins with distinct cellular functions. CHC17 forms vesicles at the plasma membrane for receptor-mediated endocytosis and at the trans-Golgi network for organelle biogenesis. CHC22 plays a key role in intracellular targeting of the insulin-regulated glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), accumulates at the site of GLUT4 sequestration during insulin resistance, and has also been implicated in neuronal development. Here, we demonstrate that CHC22 and CHC17 share morphological features, in that CHC22 forms a triskelion and latticed vesicle coats. However, cellular CHC22-coated vesicles were distinct from those formed by CHC17. The CHC22 coat was more stable to pH change and was not removed by the enzyme complex that disassembles the CHC17 coat. Moreover, the two clathrins were differentially recruited to membranes by adaptors, and CHC22 did not support vesicle formation or transferrin endocytosis at the plasma membrane in the presence or absence of CHC17. Our findings provide biochemical evidence for separate regulation and distinct functional niches for CHC17 and CHC22 in human cells.

Thus fundamental biochemical differences underlie the non-redundant functions of the two clathrins. These differences are relevant to CHC22 function in human health and disease, and could account for some of the documented differences in human and murine glucose metabolism noted from mouse models (14Brüning J.C.

However, CHC22 was implicated as a component of CHC17-coated vesicles by proteomics experiments, which showed that CHC22 was depleted from CCV preparations following siRNA-mediated down-regulation of CHC17 (16Borner G.H. Harbour M. Hester S. Lilley K.S. Robinson M.S. Comparative proteomics of clathrin-coated vesicles.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to establish the degree to which CHC22 and CHC17 form mixed lattices in cells. To this end, we purified clathrin-coated vesicles from HeLa cells using the same CCV purification protocol as in the cited proteomics study (16Borner G.H. Harbour M. Hester S. Lilley K.S.

Robinson M.S. EpsinR is an adaptor for the SNARE protein Vti1b.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5593-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and note that HeLa cells (atypical for their tissue origin) express CHC22 at similar levels to human myotubes (9Esk C. Chen C.Y. Johannes L. Brodsky F.M. The clathrin heavy chain isoform CHC22 functions in a novel endosomal sorting step.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We found that a Tris/acetate/EDTA (TAE)-buffered SDS-PAGE system described previously (18Ungewickell E. Oestergaard L. Identification of the clathrin assembly protein AP180 in crude calf brain extracts by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) separates CHC22 and CHC17 by electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1, A and B) and this analysis revealed that both isoforms were present in the coated vesicle preparation (Fig. 1A), suggesting that CHC22 is found in structures of a similar size and density as CHC17 structures known to be CCVs. We then examined the CCVs by immunoelectron microscopy using an anti-CLC antibody to detect CHC17 and an isoform-specific anti-heavy-chain antibody to detect CHC22. Immunogold labeling with secondary antibodies coupled to different-sized gold particles revealed that CCVs were primarily labeled for only one CHC isoform (Fig. 1, C and D). Quantification showed that 93.1% of CCVs with two or more gold particles were labeled by antibodies recognizing either CHC22 or CHC17 but not both (Fig. 1E). Statistical analysis of CCVs labeled with two gold particles demonstrated that the number of CCVs co-labeled for both CHC17 and CHC22 was significantly below the number that would be expected to co-label for both clathrins if mixed coats are formed, taking into account the efficiency of antibody labeling and the relative abundance (9Esk C. Chen C.Y. Johannes L. Brodsky F.M. The clathrin heavy chain isoform CHC22 functions in a novel endosomal sorting step.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) of the two clathrin heavy chains in HeLa cells (Fig. 1F; “Experimental procedures”). Negatively stained images showed that vesicles labeled only for CHC22 were coated with lattices visually similar to CHC17 lattices (Fig. 1, C and D). This analysis by electron microscopy reveals that when purified from cells, CHC22 CCVs are predominantly distinct from those formed by CHC17 (Fig. 1), although their lattices share morphology. The clathrin coat was first described for its lattice (clathrate) structure (19Woodward M.P. Roth T.F. Coated vesicles: characterization, selective dissociation, and reassembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1978; 75: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and later CHC17 clathrin was shown to be a triskelion (10Ungewickell E. Branton D. Assembly units of clathrin coats.Nature. 1981; 289: 420-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 11Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C.

Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We previously showed by size-exclusion chromatography that the recombinantly expressed C-terminal third of CHC22 (Hub fragment, residues 1074–1640) forms a trimer (6Liu S.H. Towler M.C. Chen E. Chen C.Y. Song W. Apodaca G. Brodsky F.M. A novel clathrin homolog that co-distributes with cytoskeletal components functions in the trans-Golgi network.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, due to low solubility (different from the CHC17 Hub), it was not possible to obtain sufficient CHC22 Hub protein to visualize this fragment. Without a human tissue source for purifying CHC22, we addressed whether we could purify CHC22 following over-expression in tissue culture and sought to take advantage of an existing HeLa cell transfectant (HeLa-CHC22Δx9-TO) that can over-express CHC22Δx9 under the control of a Tet-On promoter (6Liu S.H. Towler M.C. Chen E. Chen C.Y. Song W. Apodaca G. Brodsky F.M. A novel clathrin homolog that co-distributes with cytoskeletal components functions in the trans-Golgi network.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CHC22Δx9 protein lacks 60 amino acids (457–507 encoded by Exon 9) comprising the CHCR0 region between the distal leg and the N-terminal domain, so that CHC22Δx9 is virtually full-length (1580 of 1640 residues) with intact trimerization, proximal, and distal leg and terminal domains. Doxycycline treatment of HeLa-CHC22Δx9-TO caused CHC22Δx9 to be the dominant clathrin in these cells (Fig. 2, A and B). We then addressed whether CHC22 and CHC17 can be differentially dissociated from HeLa CCVs. It was previously observed that high pH combined with low salt concentrations efficiently strips CHC17 from membranes (20Unanue E.R. Ungewickell E. Branton D. The binding of clathrin triskelions to membranes from coated vesicles.Cell. 1981; 26: 439-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), so we tested the effects of pH change in low salt on releasing CHC22 from CCVs purified from untransfected HeLa cells. Sequential exposure of mixed purified CCVs to increasing pH removed CHC17 without substantially dissociating CHC22 from their respective CCVs. Only 13% of CHC22 was solubilized at pH 8.5, whereas 95% of CHC17 was released from the CCV mixture (Fig. 2, C and D). From the pellet of CCVs exposed to pH 8.5, we were able to solubilize CHC22 by exposure to 0.5 m Tris buffer, another method used in standard protocols for purifying CHC17 (21Keen J.H. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.H. Clathrin-coated vesicles: isolation, dissociation and factor-dependent reassociation of clathrin baskets.Cell. 1979; 16: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). To obtain purified CHC22Δx9, CCVs were isolated from HeLa-CHC22Δx9-TO cells treated with doxycycline, then exposed to increasing pH to remove CHC17, followed by Tris stripping the final pellet to release CHC22Δx9. To obtain purified CHC17 for comparison, CCVs were purified from untransfected HeLa cells (with a natural 10-fold excess of CHC17 over CHC22), then exposed to pH 7.0, releasing CHC17 and leaving CHC22 behind on pelleted membranes. Immunoblotting with isoform-specific antibodies confirmed the purity of the CHC22Δx9 and CHC17 obtained by these methods (Fig. 2E). Analysis of the separated purified clathrin isoforms by deep-etch electron microscopy showed that CHC22Δx9 has the same triskelion configuration and approximate dimensions as CHC17 (Fig. 2F), providing morphological evidence that CHC22 is a triskelion. The CHC17 triskelia cycle from the cytosol to nascent CCVs at the plasma membrane or other organelles, and are returned back to the cytosol by uncoating fully closed CCVs (1Brodsky F.M. Diversity of clathrin function: new tricks for an old protein.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2012; 28: 309-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Uncoating is mediated by an ATPase complex consisting of the 70-kDa heat-shock cognate protein (Hsc70) and auxilin, and requires ATP hydrolysis (22Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Role of auxilin in uncoating clathrin-coated vesicles.Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 23Rothnie A. Clarke A.R. Kuzmic P. Cameron A. Smith C.J. A sequential mechanism for clathrin cage disassembly by 70-kDa heat-shock cognate protein (Hsc70) and auxilin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 6927-6932Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Notably, CHC22 lacks the 5-residue recognition site (QLMLT) for Hsc70 binding to CHC17 (24Rapoport I. Boll W. Yu A. Böcking T. Kirchhausen T. A motif in the clathrin heavy chain required for the Hsc70/auxilin uncoating reaction.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Our previous work showed that, at steady state, most cellular CHC22 is associated with membranes, whereas CHC17 is about half-cytosolic at any one time (6Liu S.H. Towler M.C. Chen E. Chen C.Y. Song W. Apodaca G. Brodsky F.M. A novel clathrin homolog that co-distributes with cytoskeletal components functions in the trans-Golgi network.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that CHC22 disassembly dynamics are different from those of CHC17. Furthermore, the in vitro conditions necessary to dissociate CHC22 from CCVs for purification suggested differences in properties of CHC22 lattices compared with CHC17 lattices. We therefore addressed whether CHC22 CCVs are uncoated by the same cellular mechanism that operates for CHC17 coat disassembly. CCVs purified from HeLa cells were incubated with recombinant uncoating complex (UC, Hsc70 plus a functional fragment of auxilin) with and without ATP. After centrifugation, CHCs released to the supernatant or remaining in the pellet were assessed by immunoblotting with isoform-specific antibodies (Fig. 3B). The UC plus ATP effectively removed more than 50% of the CHC17 from CCVs under these conditions, but only 16% of CHC22 was released (Fig. 3C). These data show that under conditions where CHC17 coats are efficiently removed, the Hsc70–auxilin complex is significantly less efficient in uncoating CHC22 assemblies, consistent with loss of Hsc70 efficacy when the QLMLT sequence is deleted from CHC17 (24Rapoport I. Boll W. Yu A. Böcking T. Kirchhausen T. A motif in the clathrin heavy chain required for the Hsc70/auxilin uncoating reaction.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that CHC22 uncoating proceeds differently from CHC17 uncoating. Cellular dissociation of CHC22 coats may be performed by different proteins or under different conditions than cellular CHC17 disassembly. Clathrin recruitment to membranes is driven by adaptor proteins that recognize phospholipids at specific intracellular locations and selectively interact with cargo (25Kelly B.T. Owen D.J. Endocytic sorting of transmembrane protein cargo.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2011; 23: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Immunoisolation of CHC22 from HeLa cells and human skeletal muscle in earlier studies showed co-purification of the adaptors AP1, AP3, and GGA2 (Golgi-associated, γ adaptin ear-containing, adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor–binding protein 2), but not the plasma membrane-associated adaptor AP2 (6Liu S.H. Towler M.C. Chen E. Chen C.Y. Song W. Apodaca G. Brodsky F.M.

A role for the CHC22 clathrin heavy-chain isoform in human glucose metabolism.Science. 2009; 324: 1192-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the adaptors bound to CHC22 also bind to CHC17, immunoisolation showed more GGA2 co-isolated with CHC22 than with CHC17 relative to the other adaptors (7Vassilopoulos S. Esk C. Hoshino S. Funke B.H. Chen C.Y. Plocik A.M. Wright W.E. Kucherlapati R. Brodsky F.M. A role for the CHC22 clathrin heavy-chain isoform in human glucose metabolism.Science. 2009; 324: 1192-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible mechanism for their differential recruitment. To address CHC interactions with GGA2, we examined whether forced membrane association of GGA2 could attract CHC22 and/or CHC17 to membranes. It has been shown that membrane association of GGA2 dramatically increases in HeLa cells stably expressing a chimeric CD8 protein with the cytoplasmic tail of CIMPR (CD8-CIMPR) (26Hirst J. Seaman M.N. Buschow S.I. Robinson M.S. The role of cargo proteins in GGA recruitment.Traffic. 2007; 8: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In these cells, we assessed the proportion of adaptors and clathrin that were membrane associated by immunoblotting the membrane and cytosol fractions (Fig. 3, D and E). Compared with cells expressing CD8 without the cytoplasmic domain of CIMPR (CD8-WT), the fractions of GGA2 and CHC22 associated with membranes were significantly increased in the CD8-CIMPR cells. The membrane localization of CHC17 appeared slightly increased in the CD8-CIMPR cells, but this was not statistically significant (Fig. 3E). Thus, increased membrane association of GGA2 correlates with greater recruitment of CHC22 than CHC17, supporting the biochemical evidence that preferential adaptor binding properties contribute to differential localization and functions of CHC22 and CHC17. Our previous work localized CHC22 function to internal membrane traffic and showed by fluorescence microscopy that down-regulation of CHC22 did not affect receptor-mediated endocytosis of fluorescent transferrin (Tf) or epidermal growth factor (7Vassilopoulos S.

However, it was reported that in cells treated with siRNA to down-regulate CHC17, over-expressed CHC22 was apparently able to rescue endocytosis of transferrin, suggesting potential redundant roles of the two heavy-chain isoforms (13Hood F.E. Royle S.J. Functional equivalence of the clathrin heavy chains CHC17 and CHC22 in endocytosis and mitosis.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 2185-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To address whether CHC22 forms coated vesicles at the plasma membrane, we used electron microscopy to quantify the presence of clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane in cells treated with siRNA targeting CHC22 or CHC17 (Fig. 4). We found, as expected, that siRNA-mediated depletion of CHC17 caused near-complete elimination of clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane compared with control siRNA-treated cells. However, CHC22 depletion had no significant effect on the prevalence of clathrin-coated pits or vesicles at the plasma membrane compared with cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 4). Together with our previous work showing that CHC22 is not localized to the plasma membrane (6Liu S.H. Towler M.C. Chen E. Chen C.Y. Song W. Apodaca G. Brodsky F.M.

Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), these new data establish that endogenous CHC22 does not support formation of clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membrane. To address whether CHC22 can substitute for CHC17 functionally in endocytosis, we used a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to quantitatively measure Tf uptake and directly measure levels of expression of each clathrin. To ensure analysis of true receptor-mediated endocytosis and not pinocytosis, we exposed cells to 10 μg/ml of fluorescently labeled Tf at 4 °C for surface binding, then washed to remove excess (unbound) Tf prior to warming the cells to 37 °C. After uptake, residual surface Tf was stripped with acidic buffer (Fig. 5A) so that cell-associated fluorescence represented only internalized Tf from the pulsed exposure (“Experimental procedures”). To establish whether CHC22 can replace CHC17 function in receptor-mediated Tf endocytosis, we confirmed that down-regulation of CHC17 but not CHC22 affected Tf uptake (Fig"

Eighty-two international para-footballers (25.2 ± 6.8 years; 68.7 ± 8.3 kg; 175.3 ± 7.4 cm; 22.5 ± 2.7 kg·m-2), classified according to the International Federation of Cerebral Palsy Football (IFCPF) Classification Rules (classes FT5-FT8), participated in the study. A group of 31 players without CP was also included in the study as a control group. The para-footballers showed good reliability scores in all tests, with and without ball (ICC = 0.53-0.95, SEM = 2.5-9.8%). Nevertheless, the inclusion of the ball influenced testing reproducibility. The low or moderate relationships shown among sprint, acceleration/deceleration and change of direction tests with and without ball also evidenced that they measure different capabilities. Significant differences and large effect sizes (0.53 < ηp2 < 0.97; p < 0.05) were found when para-footballers performed the tests with and without dribbling the ball. Players with moderate neurological impairments (i.e. FT5, FT6, and FT7) had higher coefficients of variation in the trial requiring ball dribbling. For all the tests, we also obtained between-group (FT5-FT8) statistical and large practical differences (ηp2 = 0.35-0.62, large; p < 0.01). The proposed sprint, acceleration/deceleration and change of direction tests with and without ball may be applicable for classification purposes, that is, evaluation of activity limitation from neurological impairments, or decision-making between current CP-Football classes."
https://openalex.org/W2765612811,"Primary Zika virus (ZIKV) infections that occur during pregnancy can cause spontaneous abortion and profoundly disrupt fetal development. While the full range of developmental abnormalities associated with congenital Zika syndrome is not yet known, severe cases of the syndrome can present with microcephaly, extensive neurologic and ocular damage, and pronounced joint malformations. Animal models that accurately recapitulate congenital Zika syndrome are urgently needed for vaccine development and for the study of ZIKV pathogenesis. As guinea pigs have successfully been used to model transplacental infections by cytomegalovirus, syphilis, and Listeria monocytogenes, we sought to test whether ZIKV could productively infect guinea pigs and whether viral transmission with attendant fetal pathology would occur after a mid-gestation viral challenge. We found that guinea pig cells supported ZIKV replication in vitro. Experimental infection of non-pregnant animals did not result in overt disease but low-level, detectable viremia was observed. When pregnant guinea pigs were challenged with ZIKV at between 18 and 21 days gestational age, ZIKV was not detected in maternal or pup blood, plasma, or tissues and no significant differences in maternal weight gain or pup size were observed following challenge. Nonetheless, a robust antibody response against ZIKV was detected in both the pups and dams. These results suggest that, while guinea pigs can model aspects of the immune response to ZIKV infection during pregnancy, naturally circulating ZIKV strains are not pathogenic during the pregnancy of immunocompetent guinea pigs and do not interfere with normal pup development."
https://openalex.org/W2765304407,"In 2012, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was introduced free of charge in the Swedish national school-based vaccination programme for 10-12-year-old girls, and as catch-up vaccination for young women. In Sweden, there is an ongoing discussion about including boys in the national vaccination programme. Few studies are undertaken about adolescents’ knowledge, beliefs and HPV vaccination status in relation to socioeconomic status and sexual experience. Thus, the aim was to examine HPV catch-up vaccination status in adolescents in relation to 1) socioeconomic factors, 2) beliefs and knowledge about HPV prevention, and 3) sexual behaviour. The Health Belief Model was used as a theoretical framework. Upper secondary school students (n = 832) aged 16, randomly chosen from a larger sample, were invited to participate in conjunction with the general health interview with the school nurse. A total of 751/832 (90.3%), girls (n = 391, 52%) and boys (n = 360, 48%) completed the questionnaire. HPV vaccination was associated with ethnicity and the mothers’ education level; i.e. girls with a non-European background and girls with a less educated mother were less likely to have received the vaccine (p<0.01 and p = 0.04 respectively). Vaccinated girls perceived HPV infection as more severe (p = 0.01), had more insight into women’s susceptibility to the infection (p = 0.02), perceived more benefits of the vaccine as protection against cervical cancer (p<0.01) and had a higher intention to engage in HPV-preventive behaviour (p = 0.01). Furthermore, boys and girls were almost equally sexually experienced, although fewer girls had used condom during first intercourse with their latest partner (p = 0.03). Finally, HPV vaccinated girls were less likely to have unprotected sex (p<0.01). In summary, catch-up HPV vaccination among young girls was associated with a European background and high maternal education level, as well as more favourable beliefs towards HPV prevention and less sexual risk-taking. Further preventive measures should therefore be directed at the migrant population."
https://openalex.org/W2766675183,"Purpose To determine if the radiomic features on CT can predict progression-free survival (PFS) in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant adenocarcinoma patients treated with first-line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and to identify the incremental value of radiomic features over conventional clinical factors in PFS prediction. Methods In this institutional review board–approved retrospective study, pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT and first follow-up CT after initiation of TKIs were analyzed in 48 patients (M:F = 23:25; median age: 61 years). Radiomic features at baseline, at 1st first follow-up, and the percentage change between the two were determined. A Cox regression model was used to predict PFS with nonredundant radiomic features and clinical factors, respectively. The incremental value of radiomic features over the clinical factors in PFS prediction was also assessed by way of a concordance index. Results Roundness (HR: 3.91; 95% CI: 1.72, 8.90; P = 0.001) and grey-level nonuniformity (HR: 3.60; 95% CI: 1.80, 7.18; P<0.001) were independent predictors of PFS. For clinical factors, patient age (HR: 2.11; 95% CI: 1.01, 4.39; P = 0.046), baseline tumor diameter (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.05; P = 0.002), and treatment response (HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.87; P = 0.017) were independent predictors. The addition of radiomic features to clinical factors significantly improved predictive performance (concordance index; combined model = 0.77, clinical-only model = 0.69, P<0.001). Conclusions Radiomic features enable PFS estimation in EGFR mutant adenocarcinoma patients treated with first-line EGFR TKIs. Radiomic features combined with clinical factors provide significant improvement in prognostic performance compared with using only clinical factors."
https://openalex.org/W2767006470,"Various parasite-host interactions that involve adaptive manipulation of host behavior display time-of-day synchronization of certain events. One example is the manipulated biting behavior observed in Carpenter ants infected with Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato. We hypothesized that biological clocks play an important role in this and other parasite-host interactions. In order to identify candidate molecular clock components, we used two general strategies: bioinformatics and transcriptional profiling. The bioinformatics approach was used to identify putative homologs of known clock genes. For transcriptional profiling, RNA-Seq was performed on 48 h time courses of Ophiocordyceps kimflemingiae (a recently named species of the O. unilateralis complex), whose genome has recently been sequenced. Fungal blastospores were entrained in liquid media under 24 h light-dark (LD) cycles and were harvested at 4 h intervals either under LD or continuous darkness. Of all O. kimflemingiae genes, 5.3% had rhythmic mRNAs under these conditions (JTK Cycle, ≤ 0.057 statistical cutoff). Our data further indicates that a significant number of transcription factors have a peaked activity during the light phase (day time). The expression levels of a significant number of secreted enzymes, proteases, toxins and small bioactive compounds peaked during the dark phase or subjective night. These findings support a model whereby this fungal parasite uses its biological clock for phase-specific activity. We further suggest that this may be a general mechanism involved in parasite-host interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2767054219,"P. aegyptiaca is one of the most destructive root parasitic plants worldwide, causing serious damage to many crop species. Under natural conditions P. aegyptiaca seeds must be conditioned and then stimulated by host root exudates before germinating. However, preliminary experiments indicated that TIS108 (a triazole-type inhibitor of strigolactone) and fluridone (FL, an inhibitor of carotenoid-biosynthesis) both stimulated the germination of P. aegyptiaca seeds without a water preconditioning step (i.e. unconditioned seeds). The objective of this study was to use deep RNA sequencing to learn more about the mechanisms by which TIS108 and FL stimulate the germination of unconditioned P. aegyptiaca seeds. Deep RNA sequencing was performed to compare the mechanisms of germination in the following treatments: (i) unconditioned P. aegyptiaca seeds with no other treatment, (ii) unconditioned seeds treated with 100 mg/L TIS108, (iii) unconditioned seeds treated with 100 mg/L FL + 100 mg/L GA3, (iv) conditioned seeds treated with sterile water, and (v) conditioned seeds treated with 0.03 mg/L GR24. The de novo assembled transcriptome was used to analyze transcriptional dynamics during seed germination. The key gene categories involved in germination were also identified. The results showed that only 119 differentially expressed genes were identified in the conditioned treatment vs TIS108 treatment. This indicated that the vast majority of conditions for germination were met during the conditioning stage. Abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) played important roles during P. aegyptiaca germination. The common pathway of TIS108, FL+GA3, and GR24 in stimulating P. aegyptiaca germination was the simultaneous reduction in ABA concentrations and increase GA concentrations. These results could potentially aid the identification of more compounds that are capable of stimulating P. aegyptiaca germination. Some potential target sites of TIS108 were also identified in our transcriptome data. The results of this experiment suggest that TIS108 and FL+GA3 could be used to control P. aegyptiaca through suicidal germination."
https://openalex.org/W2766746819,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) induces the expression of fibrinogen, and polymorphic variation within the fibrinogen genes is believed to alter the magnitude of this expression. The identification of the functional relevance of individual fibrinogen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has been hindered by the high linkage disequilibrium (LD) reported in the European fibrinogen gene locus. This study investigated two novel and 12 known fibrinogen SNPs of potential functional relevance, in 2010 Tswana individuals known to have low LD. We aimed to identify functional polymorphisms that contribute to clot-related phenotypes and total and γ’ fibrinogen concentrations independently and through their interaction with IL-6, by taking advantage of the high fibrinogen and IL-6 concentrations and the low LD reported in black South Africans. Fibrinogen was significantly associated with IL-6, thereby mediating associations of IL-6 with clot formation and structure, although attenuating the association of IL-6 with clot lysis time. None of the common European fibrinogen haplotypes was present in this study population. Putative functional fibrinogen SNPs FGB–rs7439150, rs1800789 (–1420G/A) and rs1800787 (–148C/T) were significantly associated with fibrinogen concentration and altered clot properties, with several associations significantly influenced by IL-6 concentrations. The impact of harbouring several minor fibrinogen SNP alleles on the association of IL-6 and fibrinogen concentration was cumulative, with possession of each additional minor allele showing a stronger relationship of IL-6 with fibrinogen. This was also reflected in differences in clot properties, suggesting potential clinical relevance. Therefore, when investigating the effect of fibrinogen genetics on fibrinogen concentrations and CVD outcome, the possible interactions with modulating factors and the fact that SNP effects seem to be additive should be taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W2765352086,"Early-cleaving embryos are known to have better capacity to reach the blastocyst stage and produce better quality embryos compared to late-cleaving embryos. To investigate the significance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress on early embryo cleavage kinetics and development, porcine embryos produced in vitro were separated into early- and late-cleaving groups and then cultured in the absence or presence of the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). Developing embryos were collected at days 3 to 7 of culture for assessment of ER stress status, incidence of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), development and total cell number. In the absence of TUDCA treatment, late-cleaving embryos exhibited ER stress, higher incidence of DNA DSBs, as well as reductions in development to the blastocyst stage and total embryo cell numbers. Treatment of late-cleaving embryos with TUDCA mitigated these effects and markedly improved embryo quality and development. These results demonstrate the importance of stress coping responses in early developing embryos, and that reduction of ER stress is a potential means to improve embryo quality and developmental competence."
https://openalex.org/W2766501793,"In this study, the effects of coronatine treatment on the growth, comprehensive metabolic profiles, and productivity of bioactive compounds, including phenolics and phytosterols, in whole plant cultures of Lemna paucicostata were investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. To determine the optimal timing of coronatine elicitation, coronatine was added on days 0, 23, and 28 after inoculation. The total growth of L. paucicostata was not significantly different between the coronatine treated groups and the control. The coronatine treatment in L. paucicostata induced increases in the content of hydroxycinnamic acids, such as caffeic acid, isoferulic acid, ρ-coumaric acid, sinapic acid, and phytosterols, such as campesterol and β-sitosterol. The productivity of these useful metabolites was highest when coronatine was added on day 0 and harvested on day 32. These results suggest that coronatine treatment on day 0 activates the phenolic and phytosterol biosynthetic pathways in L. paucicostata to a greater extent than in the control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate the effects of coronatine on the alteration of metabolism in L. paucicostata based on GC-MS profiling. The results of this research provide a foundation for designing strategies for enhanced production of useful metabolites for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries by cultivation of L. paucicostata."
https://openalex.org/W2766673096,"Automatic extraction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) pairs from biomedical literature is a widely examined task in biological information extraction. Currently, many kernel based approaches such as linear kernel, tree kernel, graph kernel and combination of multiple kernels has achieved promising results in PPI task. However, most of these kernel methods fail to capture the semantic relation information between two entities. In this paper, we present a special type of tree kernel for PPI extraction which exploits both syntactic (structural) and semantic vectors information known as Distributed Smoothed Tree kernel (DSTK). DSTK comprises of distributed trees with syntactic information along with distributional semantic vectors representing semantic information of the sentences or phrases. To generate robust machine learning model composition of feature based kernel and DSTK were combined using ensemble support vector machine (SVM). Five different corpora (AIMed, BioInfer, HPRD50, IEPA, and LLL) were used for evaluating the performance of our system. Experimental results show that our system achieves better f-score with five different corpora compared to other state-of-the-art systems."
https://openalex.org/W2765312362,"Understanding the regional relationships between climate change and crop production will benefit strategic decisions for future agricultural adaptation in China. In this study, the combined effects of climatic factors on spring wheat phenophase and grain yield over the past three decades in Inner Mongolia, China, were explored based on the daily climate variables from 1981–2014 and detailed observed data of spring wheat from 1981–2014. Inner Mongolia was divided into three different climate type regions, the eastern, central and western regions. The data were gathered from 10 representative agricultural meteorological experimental stations in Inner Mongolia and analysed with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model. First, the performance of the APSIM model in the spring wheat planting areas of Inner Mongolia was tested. Then, the key climatic factors limiting the phenophases and yield of spring wheat were identified. Finally, the responses of spring wheat phenophases and yield to climate change were further explored regionally. Our results revealed a general yield reduction of spring wheat in response to the pronounced climate warming from 1981 to 2014, with an average of 3564 kg·ha-1. The regional differences in yields were significant. The maximum potential yield of spring wheat was found in the western region. However, the minimum potential yield was found in the middle region. The air temperature and soil surface temperature were the optimum climatic factors that affected the key phenophases of spring wheat in Inner Mongolia. The influence of the average maximum temperature on the key phenophases of spring wheat was greater than the average minimum temperature, followed by the relative humidity and solar radiation. The most insensitive climatic factors were precipitation, wind speed and reference crop evapotranspiration. As for the yield of spring wheat, temperature, solar radiation and air relative humidity were major meteorological factors that affected in the eastern and western Inner Mongolia. Furthermore, the effect of the average minimum temperature on yield was greater than that of the average maximum temperature. The increase of temperature in the western and middle regions would reduce the spring wheat yield, while in the eastern region due to the rising temperature, the spring wheat yield increased. The increase of solar radiation in the eastern and central regions would increase the yield of spring wheat. The increased air relative humidity would make the western spring wheat yield increased and the eastern spring wheat yield decreased. Finally, the models describing combined effects of these dominant climatic factors on the maturity and yield in different regions of Inner Mongolia were used to establish geographical differences. Our findings have important implications for improving climate change impact studies and for local agricultural production to cope with ongoing climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2766075783,"Background Currently, Indian officials are incorporating a domestically manufactured rotavirus vaccine (based on the 116E rotavirus strain) into the country’s universal immunization program; this vaccine will cost significantly less than western rotavirus vaccines. Here, we examine the public health impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination in India using the 116E vaccine. This work will allow comparison of universal 116E vaccination with other approaches to child mortality reduction, shed light on the future burden of rotavirus disease in India, and help stakeholders understand future resource needs. Methods Using information from published literature, we developed a dynamic simulation model of rotavirus transmission, natural history, and related utilization among Indian infants followed until age five. Infection risk depended on the degree of viral shedding in the population. Infection risk and severity were influenced by age, number of previous infections, and vaccination history. Probabilities of inpatient and outpatient health services utilization depended on symptom severity. With the model, we compared a strategy of nationwide 116E vaccination to one of no vaccination. Costs were considered from the perspective of all payers (including families) and from the societal perspective. Results We estimated that an established 116E vaccination program would reduce symptomatic rotavirus infection by 13.0%, while reducing population-wide rotavirus mortality by 34.6% (over 34,000 lives annually). Rotavirus outpatient visits would decline by 21.3%, and hospitalization would decline by 28.1%. The cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted was estimated at 3,429 Rupees (approximately $56). Predicted mortality reduction in children born during the first five years of vaccination implementation was nearly identical to that in children born in later years (34.4% versus 34.6%). Conclusions 116E vaccination of Indian infants would likely substantially reduce rotavirus-related morbidity, mortality, and utilization at a cost considered highly cost-effective by standard criteria. Nearly the entire mortality reduction benefit of vaccination was attributable to direct protection of those vaccinated, as opposed to indirect “herd immunity” effects."
https://openalex.org/W2767117740,"β-cells release hexameric Zn2+-insulin into the extracellular space, but monomeric Zn2+-free insulin appears to be the only biologically active form. The mechanisms implicated in dissociation of the hexamer remain unclear, but they seem to be Zn2+ concentration-dependent. In this study, we investigate the influence of albumin binding to Zn2+ on Zn2+-insulin dissociation into Zn2+-free insulin and its physiological, methodological and therapeutic relevance. Glucose and K+-induced insulin release were analyzed in isolated mouse islets by static incubation and perifusion experiments in the presence and absence of albumin and Zn2+ chelators. Insulin tolerance tests were performed in rats using different insulin solutions with and without Zn2+ and/or albumin. Albumin-free buffer does not alter quantification by RIA of Zn2+-free insulin but strongly affects RIA measurements of Zn2+-insulin. In contrast, accurate determination of Zn2+-insulin was obtained only when bovine serum albumin or Zn2+ chelators were present in the assay buffer solution. Albumin and Zn2+ chelators do not modify insulin release but do affect insulin determination. Preincubation with albumin or Zn2+ chelators promotes the conversion of “slow” Zn2+-insulin into “fast” insulin. Consequently, insulin diffusion from large islets is ameliorated in the presence of Zn2+ chelators. These observations support the notion that the Zn2+-binding properties of albumin improve the dissociation of Zn2+-insulin into subunits after exocytosis, which may be useful in insulin determination, insulin pharmacokinetic assays and islet transplantation."

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been widely performed in patients with blood disorders and cancers. However, the cellular-level behaviors of the transplanted bone marrow cells over wide-areas of the host bone marrow after the BMT are not fully understood yet. In this work, we performed a longitudinal wide-area cellular-level observation of the calvarial bone marrow after the BMT in vivo. Using a H2B-GFP/β-actin-DsRed double-transgenic mouse model as a donor, a subcellular-level nuclear-cytoplasmic visualization of the transplanted bone marrow cells was achieved, which enabled a direct in vivo dynamic monitoring of the distribution and proliferation of the transplanted bone marrow cells. The same spots in the wide-area of the calvarial bone marrow were repeatedly identified using fluorescently labeled vasculature as a distinct landmark. It revealed various dynamic cellular-level behaviors of the transplanted BM cells in early stage such as cluster formation, migration, and active proliferation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2766330435,"The composition of ecological assemblages depends on a variety of factors including environmental filtering, biotic interactions and dispersal limitation. By evaluating the phylogenetic pattern of assemblages, we gain insight into the relative contribution of these mechanisms to generating observed assemblages. We address some limitations in the field of community phylogenetics by using simulations, biologically relevant null models, and cost distance analysis to evaluate simultaneous mechanisms leading to observed patterns of co-occurrence. Building from past studies of phylogenetic community structure, we applied our approach to hummingbird assemblages in the Northern Andes. We compared the relationship between relatedness and co-occurrence among predicted assemblages, based on estimates of suitable habitat and dispersal limitation, and observed assemblages. Hummingbird co-occurrence peaked at intermediate relatedness and decreased when a closely-related species was present. This result was most similar to simulations that included simultaneous effects of phylogenetic conservatism and repulsion. In addition, we found older sister taxa were only weakly more separated by geographic barriers, suggesting that time since dispersal is unlikely to be the sole factor influencing co-occurrence of closely related species. Our analysis highlights the role of multiple mechanisms acting simultaneously, and provides a hypothesis for the potential importance of competition at regional scales."
https://openalex.org/W2767138713,"Widely considered as one of the cradles of human civilization, Mesopotamia is largely situated in the Republic of Iraq, which is also the birthplace of the Sumerian, Akkadian, Assyrian and Babylonian civilizations. These lands were subsequently ruled by the Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Mongolians, Ottomans and finally British prior to the independence. As a direct consequence of this rich history, the contemporary Iraqi population comprises a true mosaic of different ethnicities, which includes Arabs, Kurds, Turkmens, Assyrians, and Yazidis among others. As such, the genetics of the contemporary Iraqi populations are of anthropological and forensic interest. In an effort to contribute to a better understanding of the genetic basis of this ethnic diversity, a total of 500 samples were collected from Northern Iraqi volunteers belonging to five major ethnic groups, namely: Arabs (n = 102), Kurds (n = 104), Turkmens (n = 102), Yazidis (n = 106) and Syriacs (n = 86). 17-loci Y-STR analyses were carried out using the AmpFlSTR Yfiler system, and subsequently in silico haplogroup assignments were made to gain insights from a molecular anthropology perspective. Systematic comparisons of the paternal lineages of these five Northern Iraqi ethnic groups, not only among themselves but also in the context of the larger genetic landscape of the Near East and beyond, were then made through the use of two different genetic distance metric measures and the associated data visualization methods. Taken together, results from the current study suggested the presence of intricate Y-chromosomal lineage patterns among the five ethic groups analyzed, wherein both interconnectivity and independent microvariation were observed in parallel, albeit in a differential manner. Notably, the novel Y-STR data on Turkmens, Syriacs and Yazidis from Northern Iraq constitute the first of its kind in the literature. Data presented herein is expected to contribute to further population and forensic investigations in Northern Iraq in particular and the Near East in general."
https://openalex.org/W2766084193,"Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration that accelerates the loss of disc structural and functional integrities is recognized as one of the major factors of chronic back pain. Cardiovascular risk factors, such as deficits of apolipoproteins that elevate the levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, are considered critical for the progress of atherosclerosis; notably in the abdominal aorta and its lumbar branching arteries that supply lumbar vertebrae and IVDs. Obstruction of the lumbar arteries by atherosclerosis is presumed to promote lumbar disc degeneration and low back pain. APOE-knockout rabbits have recently been shown to generate hyperlipidemia with increased levels of cholesterol and triglycerides that mimic the symptoms of atherosclerosis in humans. Here, we analysed IVD degeneration in the lumbar spines of ten homozygous APOE-knockout and four wild-type New Zealand White rabbits of matching age to prove accelerated IVD degeneration in APOE-knockout rabbits, since APOE-knockout rabbits could be a beneficial model for therapeutic approaches of degenerative IVD disorders. Experiments were performed using T1/T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, glucose-oxidase assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative reverse transcription PCR and western blot. APOE-knockout lumbar spines showed more advanced IVD degeneration, obstructed lumbar arteries and lower enhancement of contrast agent in IVDs. Moreover, lower concentration of glucose, lower number of viable cells and lower concentrations of aggrecan, collagen II and higher concentration of collagen I were detected in APOE-knockout IVDs (p < 0.0001). APOE-knockout in rabbits could induce structurally deteriorating premature IVD degeneration that mimics the symptoms of accelerated IVD degeneration in humans. APOE-knockout rabbits could be used as beneficial model, as they can bypass the standard surgical interventions that are commonly applied in research animals for the induction of enhanced IVD degeneration. Their parallel use in therapeutic approaches of IVD disorders and atherosclerosis could reduce the number of research animals to be used and contribute to the principles of 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement)."
https://openalex.org/W2766508720,"Background Gregarines represent an important transition step from free-living predatory (colpodellids s.l.) and/or photosynthetic (Chromera and Vitrella) apicomplexan lineages to the most important pathogens, obligate intracellular parasites of humans and domestic animals such as coccidians and haemosporidians (Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Eimeria, Babesia, etc.). While dozens of genomes of other apicomplexan groups are available, gregarines are barely entering the molecular age. Among the gregarines, archigregarines possess a unique mixture of ancestral (myzocytosis) and derived (lack of apicoplast, presence of subpellicular microtubules) features. Methodology/Principal findings In this study we revisited five of the early-described species of the genus Selenidium including the type species Selenidium pendula, with special focus on surface ultrastructure and molecular data. We were also able to describe three new species within this genus. All species were characterized at morphological (light and scanning electron microscopy data) and molecular (SSU rDNA sequence data) levels. Gregarine specimens were isolated from polychaete hosts collected from the English Channel near the Station Biologique de Roscoff, France: Selenidium pendula from Scolelepis squamata, S. hollandei and S. sabellariae from Sabellaria alveolata, S. sabellae from Sabella pavonina, Selenidium fallax from Cirriformia tentaculata, S. spiralis sp. n. and S. antevariabilis sp. n. from Amphitritides gracilis, and S. opheliae sp. n. from Ophelia roscoffensis. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of these data showed archigregarines clustering into five separate clades and support previous doubts about their monophyly. Conclusions/Significance Our phylogenies using the extended gregarine sampling show that the archigregarines are indeed not monophyletic with one strongly supported clade of Selenidium sequences around the type species S. pendula. We suggest the revision of the whole archigregarine taxonomy with only the species within this clade remaining in the genus Selenidium, while the other species should be moved into newly erected genera. However, the SSU rDNA phylogenies show very clearly that the tree topology and therefore the inferred relationships within and in between clades are unstable and such revision would be problematic without additional sequence data."
https://openalex.org/W2766457473,"Notch signaling plays an important role in several cellular functions including growth, differentiation, cell fate determination and stemness. Increased Notch activity has been linked to several types of cancers. Activation of Notch signaling is triggered by the interaction of Notch receptors (Notch1-4) with 5 different ligands (Jagged1-2 and Dll1-3-4) expressed on the neighbouring cells. Currently, indirect approaches to inhibit Notch signalling are based on the inhibition of the key step of Notch activation catalyzed by the γ-Secretase and thereby affect several different γ-Secretase substrates; conversely direct strategies get advantage of antibody-based drugs. The evidence that Jagged-mediated Notch activation plays a key role in cancer cell biology and the interplay with the surrounding microenvironment prompted us to develop a strategy to directly inhibit Notch activation by uncoupling its interaction with the Jagged, using an unprecedented approach based on small molecules. We set-up a screening strategy based on: protein::protein docking of crystallographic structures of Notch1 with Jagged1; comparative modelling of the Notch2:Jagged2 complex, based on the Notch1::Jagged1 complex; in silico high-throughput screening directed to Notch2 interaction surface of a virtual chemical library containing a large variety of molecules commercially available. The predicted pharmacological activity of the selected compounds was validated in vitro by a gene reporter and a viability assay. This approach led to the successful identification of two candidates with different anti-proliferative potency and efficacy. This represents the first step towards the rational identification of candidate molecules for the development of entirely novel drugs directed to inhibit Notch signaling in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2766830942,"H19 RNA is highly expressed at early postnatal ages and precipitously decreases at a specific time corresponding with increases in expression of genes important for mature liver function, such as drug metabolizing enzymes. H19’s role in the regulation of liver maturation is currently unknown. Using an H19 knockout mouse model to determine the role of H19 in liver development, we quantified gene expression for insulin growth factor signaling, Wnt signaling, key cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes known to change as the liver develops, and fetal and adult plasma protein produced in liver. In mice lacking H19 expression, liver weights were significantly increased immediately after birth and significant increases were found in the number of actively proliferating cells. Increases in cell proliferation may be due to increases in β-catenin protein affecting Wnt signaling, increases in insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) expression, and/or increases in insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) expression at the protein level. Loss of targeted inhibition of IGF1R by microRNA 675 (miR-675) may be the cause of IGF1R increases, as miR-675 expression is also abrogated with loss of H19 expression in our model. P450 expression patterns were largely unchanged. No change in the production of plasma proteins was found, indicating H19 may not be important for liver maturation despite its role in controlling cell proliferation during liver growth. H19 may be important for normal liver development, and understanding how the liver matures will assist in predicting drug efficacy and toxicity in pediatric populations."

In this study, we explored the involvement of FoxO3 in severe β-thalassemia. Using primary CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients with β-thalassemia major, we successfully developed an in vitro model of ineffective erythropoiesis. Based on this model, FoxO3 activity was quantified in single cells using high throughput imaging flow cytometry. This study revealed a significant reduction of FoxO3 activity during the late stage of erythroblast differentiation in β-thalassemia, in contrast to erythropoiesis in normal cells that maintain persistent activation of FoxO3. In agreement with the decreased FoxO3 activity in β-thalassemia, the expression of FoxO3 target genes was also found to decrease, concurrent with elevated phosphorylation of AKT, most clearly at the late stage of erythroid differentiation. Our findings provide further evidence for the involvement of FoxO3 during terminal erythropoiesis and confirm the modulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway as a potential therapeutic strategy for β-thalassemia."
https://openalex.org/W2767164979,"Introduction Anemia is a global public health problem that has affected a significant number of pregnant mothers worldwide. The World Health Organization has estimated the prevalence of anemia in pregnant women at 18% and 56% in developed and developing countries, respectively. This study aimed to identify factors associated with severe anemia among laboring women in Mekelle city public hospitals, Tigray, Ethiopia. Methods This unmatched case–control study involved 264 (88 = cases and 176 = controls) pregnant women who were recruited when they came for delivery service in Mekelle city public hospitals. The data was collected from July to August, 2016. In this study, a systematic sampling technique was used inselecting controls, but the cases were enrolled until the required sample size was reached. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to find predictors of severe anemia. Statistically significant predictors of severe anemia were identified at P-value <0.05 and 95% confidence interval. Results A total of 264 pregnant women who came for delivery services were enrolled in this study. The major predicting variables for the occurrence of severe anemia among laboring women were residency (AOR = 3.28, 95% CI: 1.26–8.48), number of pregnancies (AOR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.14–5.29), iron folate supplementation (AOR = 3.29, 95% CI: 1.27–8.49), dietary diversification score (AOR = 3.23, 95% CI: 1.19–8.71) and duration of menstrual cycle (AOR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.10–5.10). The variable ‘blood loss during pregnancy’ (AOR = 6.63 95% CI: 2.96–14.86) was identified as a strong predictor of the outcome variable, severe anemia. Conclusion This study identified determinants of severe anemia among laboring women in Mekelle city public hospitals, Northern Ethiopia. To reduce anemia, strengthening health education provision related to the importance of birth spacing and consuming diversified and iron-enriched food should be considered. Moreover, screening of pregnant women for state of anemia during their visits to health facilities, as well as de-worming for intestinal parasites infection are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2766738055,"Meat from Holstein and crossbred organic dairy steers finished on winter rye and winter wheat pastures was evaluated and compared for meat quality, fatty acid and amino acid profiles, and consumer acceptability. Two adjacent 4-ha plots were established with winter rye or winter wheat cover crops in September 2015 at the University of Minnesota West Central Research and Outreach Center (Morris, MN). During spring of 2015, 30 steers were assigned to one of three replicate breed groups at birth. Breed groups were comprised of: Holstein (HOL; n = 10), crossbreds comprised of Montbéliarde, Viking Red, and HOL (MVH; n = 10), and crossbreds comprised of Normande, Jersey, and Viking Red (NJV; n = 10). Dairy steers were maintained in their respective replicate breed group from three days of age until harvest. After weaning, steers were fed an organic total mixed ration of organic corn silage, alfalfa silage, corn, soybean meal, and minerals until spring 2016. Breed groups were randomly assigned to winter rye or winter wheat and rotationally grazed from spring until early summer of 2016. For statistical analysis, independent variables were fixed effects of breed, forage, and the interaction of breed and forage, with replicated group as a random effect. Specific contrast statements were used to compare HOL versus crossbred steers. Fat from crossbreds had 13% greater omega-3 fatty acids than HOL steers. Furthermore, the omega-6/3 ratio was 14% lower in fat from crossbreds than HOL steers. For consumer acceptability, steaks from steers grazed on winter wheat had greater overall liking than steers grazed on winter rye. Steak from crossbreeds had greater overall liking than HOL steers. The results suggest improvement in fatty acids and sensory attributes of beef from crossbred dairy steers compared to HOL steers, as well as those finished on winter wheat compared to winter rye."

We observed for both strains a shift from homolactic towards more mixed acid fermentation when comparing high to low growth rates. However, this change was more pronounced for LS25 than for 23K, where dominating products were lactate>formate>acetate≥ethanol at both conditions. A multivariate approach was used for analyzing proteome and transcriptome data from the bacterial cultures, where the predictive power of the omics data was used for identifying features that can explain the differences in the end-product profiles. We show that the different degree of response to the same energy restriction revealed interesting strain specific regulation. An elevated formate production level during slow growth, more for LS25 than for 23K, was clearly reflected in correlating pyruvate formate lyase expression. With stronger effect for LS25, differential expression of the Rex transcriptional regulator and NADH oxidase, a target of Rex, indicated that maintainance of the cell redox balance, in terms of the NADH/NAD+ ratio, may be a key process during the metabolic change. The results provide a better understanding of different strategies that cells may deploy in response to changes in substrate availability."

A few small, randomized studies indicate that LDN may have beneficial effects in MS and other autoimmune diseases. If proven efficacious, it would be a cheap and safe alternative to the expensive treatments currently recommended for MS. We investigated whether a sudden increase in LDN use in Norway in 2013 was followed by changes in dispensing of other medications used to treat MS. We performed a quasi-experimental before-and-after study based on population data from the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). We included all patients that collected at least one LDN prescription in 2013, and had collected at least two medications with a reimbursement code for MS, or collected a medication with MS as the only indication in 2009 or 2010. Outcomes were differences in cumulative dispensed doses and incidence of users of disease modifying MS therapies, and medications used to treat MS symptoms two years before and two years after dispensing the initial LDN prescription. The eligible 341 patients collected 20 921 prescriptions in the observation period. Apart from changes in line with general trends in MS therapy in Norway, there was no difference in neither dispensed cumulative doses or number of prevalent users of MS specific medication. Initiation of LDN was not followed by reductions of other medications used to treat symptoms associated with MS."
https://openalex.org/W2765279619,"A data-adaptive, multiscale version of Rényi’s quadratic entropy (RQE) is introduced for emotional state discrimination from EEG recordings. The algorithm is applied to scalp EEG recordings of 30 participants watching 4 emotionally-charged video clips taken from a validated public database. Krippendorff’s inter-rater statistic reveals that multiscale RQE of the mid-frontal scalp electrodes best discriminates between five emotional states. Multiscale RQE is also applied to joint scalp EEG, amygdala- and occipital pole intracranial recordings of an implanted patient watching a neutral and an emotionally charged video clip. Unlike for the neutral video clip, the RQEs of the mid-frontal scalp electrodes and the amygdala-implanted electrodes are observed to coincide in the time range where the crux of the emotionally-charged video clip is revealed. In addition, also during this time range, phase synchrony between the amygdala and mid-frontal recordings is maximal, as well as our 30 participants’ inter-rater agreement on the same video clip. A source reconstruction exercise using intracranial recordings supports our assertion that amygdala could contribute to mid-frontal scalp EEG. On the contrary, no such contribution was observed for the occipital pole’s intracranial recordings. Our results suggest that emotional states discriminated from mid-frontal scalp EEG are likely to be mirrored by differences in amygdala activations in particular when recorded in response to emotionally-charged scenes."
https://openalex.org/W2766216057,"The nematode Ascaridia galli (order Ascaridida) is an economically important intestinal parasite responsible for increased food consumption, reduced performance and elevated mortality in commercial poultry production. This roundworm is an emerging problem in several European countries on farms with laying hens, as a consequence of the recent European Union (EU) ban on conventional battery cages. As infection is associated with slow development of low levels of acquired protective immunity, parasite control relies on repeated use of dewormers (anthelmintics). Benzimidazoles (BZ) are currently the only anthelmintic registered in the EU for use in controlling A. galli and there is an obvious risk of overuse of one drug class, selecting for resistance. Thus we developed a reference transcriptome of A. galli to investigate the response in gene expression before and after exposure to the BZ drug flubendazole (FLBZ). Transcriptional variations between treated and untreated A. galli showed that transcripts annotated as mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 were significantly down-regulated in treated worms, whereas transcripts homologous to heat shock proteins (HSP), catalase, phosphofructokinase, and a multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (PGP1) were significantly up-regulated in treated worms. Investigation of candidate transcripts responsible for anthelmintic resistance in livestock nematodes led to identification of several tubulins, including six new isoforms of beta-tubulin, and several ligand-gated ionotropic receptors and ABC-transporters. We discovered several transcripts associated with drug binding and processing genes, but further characterisation using a larger set of worms exposed to BZs in functional assays is required to determine how these are involved in drug binding and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2767085722,"Voice change is one of the earliest features of Parkinson's disease. However, quantitative studies of vocal fold dynamics which are needed to provide insight into disease biology, aid diagnosis, or track progression, are few.We therefore quantified arytenoid cartilage movements and glottic area during repeated phonation in 15 patients with Parkinson's disease (symptom duration < 6 years) and 19 controls, with 320-slice computerised tomography (CT). We related these measures to perceptual voice evaluations and spirometry. We hypothesised that Parkinson's disease patients have a smaller inter-arytenoid distance, a preserved or larger glottic area because vocal cord bowing has previously been reported, less variability in loudness, more voice dysdiadochokinesis and breathiness and a shortened phonation time because of arytenoid hypokinesis relative to glottic area.Inter-arytenoid distance in Parkinson's disease patients was moderately smaller (Mdn = 0.106, IQR = 0.091-0.116) than in controls (Mdn = 0.132, IQR = 0.116-0.166) (W = 212, P = 0.015, r = -0.42), normalised for anatomical and other inter-subject variance, analysed with two-tailed Wilcoxon's rank sum test. This finding was confirmed in a linear mixed model analysis-Parkinson's disease significantly predicted a reduction in the dependent variable, inter-arytenoid distance (b = -0.87, SEb = 0.39, 95% CI [-1.66, -0.08], t(31) = -2.24, P = 0.032). There was no difference in glottic area. On perceptual voice evaluation, patients had more breathiness and dysdiadochokinesis, a shorter maximum phonation time, and less variability in loudness than controls. There was no difference in spirometry after adjustment for smoking history.As predicted, vocal fold adduction movements are reduced in Parkinson's disease on repeated phonation but glottic area is maintained. Some perceptual characteristics of Parkinsonian speech reflect these changes. We are the first to use 320-slice CT to study laryngeal motion. Our findings indicate how Parkinson's disease affects intrinsic laryngeal muscle position and excursion."
https://openalex.org/W2765709750,"The discrepancy between spatial orientations of an endoscopic image and a physician's working environment can make it difficult to interpret endoscopic images. In this study, we developed and evaluated a device that corrects the endoscopic image orientation using an accelerometer and gyrosensor. The acceleration of gravity and angular velocity were retrieved from the accelerometer and gyrosensor attached to the handle of the endoscope. The rotational angle of the endoscope handle was calculated using a Kalman filter with transmission delay compensation. Technical evaluation of the orientation correction system was performed using a camera by comparing the optical rotational angle from the captured image with the rotational angle calculated from the sensor outputs. For the clinical utility test, fifteen anesthesiology residents performed a video endoscopic examination of an airway model with and without using the orientation correction system. The participants reported numbers written on papers placed at the left main, right main, and right upper bronchi of the airway model. The correctness and the total time it took participants to report the numbers were recorded. During the technical evaluation, errors in the calculated rotational angle were less than 5 degrees. In the clinical utility test, there was a significant time reduction when using the orientation correction system compared with not using the system (median, 52 vs. 76 seconds; P = .012). In this study, we developed a real-time endoscopic image orientation correction system, which significantly improved physician performance during a video endoscopic exam."
https://openalex.org/W2766640233,"Barth syndrome is a rare X-linked disease affecting less than 200 individuals worldwide. Several comorbidities have been associated with the pathology and, among those, cardiac myopathy and neutropenia are the most life threatening. The appropriate nutritive support is important to sustain the everyday life of Barth syndrome patients given the chronic fatigue they experience. Since they often prefer salty and fried food, and avoid vegetables and fruits, their eating habit and food preferences do not always provide the proper amount of vitamins and amino acids. It has been indeed reported that Barth syndrome patients have altered taste sensitivity. As olfaction also contributes to food consumption and flavor perception, we decided to investigate their olfactory abilities using the ""Sniffin' sticks' extended test"". We found no significant difference in any of the tested olfactory abilities between the group of Barth syndrome patients and the healthy controls. In summary, altered food preference of Barth boys could not be easily explained with an altered olfactory perception."
https://openalex.org/W2766614814,"We have performed open cell transmission electron microscopy experiments through pure water vapor in the saturation pressure regime (>0.6 kPa), in a modern microscope capable of sub-Å resolution. We have systematically studied achievable pressure levels, stability and gas purity, effective thickness of the water vapor column and associated electron scattering processes, and the effect of gas pressure on electron optical resolution and image contrast. For example, for 1.3 kPa pure water vapor and 300kV electrons, we report pressure stability of ± 20 Pa over tens of minutes, effective thickness of 0.57 inelastic mean free paths, lattice resolution of 0.14 nm on a reference Au specimen, and no significant degradation in contrast or stability of a biological specimen (M13 virus, with 6 nm body diameter). We have also done some brief experiments to confirm feasibility of loading specimens into an in situ water vapor ambient without exposure to intermediate desiccating conditions. Finally, we have also checked if water experiments had any discernible impact on the microscope performance, and report pertinent vacuum and electron optical data, for reference purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2765166463,"Cane Toads (Rhinella marina) are invasive pests in many parts of the world, including the Japanese island of Ishigaki. Extensive research in Australia has identified promising new methods for control, but also has shown that toads exhibit geographic variation in many traits (suggesting that methods developed in one location may not work in another). Can the approaches developed in Australia play a useful role for controlling this invasive species in Japan? Our experimental trials on Ishigaki Island suggest that these new methods can be successfully applied to Japan. First, Cane Toad embryos exposed to chemical cues of conspecific tadpoles exhibited a reduction in viability (subsequent growth and development). This response appears to be species-specific, with native frog embryos not being affected by exposure to cues from toad tadpoles, and Cane Toad embryos not being affected by exposure to cues from native frog tadpoles. Second, Cane Toad tadpoles were attracted to traps containing water from conspecific eggs, and toxin from adult conspecifics. Third, adult Cane Toads were attracted to acoustic cues of calling males, with sex differences in rates of attraction to specific versions of a synthetic call (males were attracted to choruses whereas females were attracted to low-frequency calls). Our results suggest that the methods developed by Australian researchers are applicable to controlling invasive Cane Toads in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2766567387,"Obtaining informative short tandem repeat (STR) profiles from degraded DNA samples is a challenging task usually undermined by locus or allele dropouts and peak-high imbalances observed in capillary electrophoresis (CE) electropherograms, especially for those markers with large amplicon sizes. We hereby show that the current STR assays may be greatly improved for the detection of genetic markers in degraded DNA samples by using long single stranded DNA polynucleotides (ssDNA polynucleotides) as surrogates for PCR primers. These long primers allow a closer annealing to the repeat sequences, thereby reducing the length of the template required for the amplification in fragmented DNA samples, while at the same time rendering amplicons of larger sizes suitable for multiplex assays. We also demonstrate that the annealing of long ssDNA polynucleotides does not need to be fully complementary in the 5’ region of the primers, thus allowing for the design of practically any long primer sequence for developing new multiplex assays. Furthermore, genotyping of intact DNA samples could also benefit from utilizing long primers since their close annealing to the target STR sequences may overcome wrong profiling generated by insertions/deletions present between the STR region and the annealing site of the primers. Additionally, long ssDNA polynucleotides might be utilized in multiplex PCR assays for other types of degraded or fragmented DNA, e.g. circulating, cell-free DNA (ccfDNA)."
