https://openalex.org/W2057335623,"High population density and increased institutional specialization, which are relatively novel features of human society. have provided conditions for a more efficient exchange of universalistic resources, while decreasing the opportunity for exchanging particularistic ones. The parallel with physical environment is striking: in both cases technology has created new problems in the process of solving old ones. Whether it is natural resources or interpersonal resources, physical ecology or social ecology, recognizing and defining the new problem is the first step toward its solution. The importance of particularistic resources in solving problems of modern society has scarcely been recognized. Welfare institutions, for example, often require clients to lose status for the money they receive. This form of exchange deprives the client of a resource which is already scarce for him, thus further reducing his chances of autonomous performance as a resource exchanger in society. By ignoring the significance of particularistic resources for social functioning, we tend to see the solution of social problems exclusively in terms of a better distribution of economic resources. Improvement of education, for instance, is considered almost equivalent to allocating more money for schools. Truly money is one of the neighbors of information in the order, but the other one is status. Evidence to suggest that higher status improves educational achievement has, indeed, been repeatedly reported (26). The very mention of particularistic resources in social planning causes uneasiness and bafflement. The economist Levitan (27), for example, in reviewing the activities of VISTA (a program of the Office of Economic Opportunity), wonders how to evaluate goals such as dedication, involvement, and good feeling. The reluctance to include particularistic resources in social engineering will hopefully decrease as we improve techniques for their observation and measurement and as we begin to understand their rules of exchange and their relationship to other resources. The work described here may constitute a step in such a direction. The opportunity to progress more decisively toward a comprehensive picture of the state of resources in society is provided by the proposal to institute social indicators (28). Properly constructed they could supply much needed information about resource deficiencies that affect the health of society and could suggest. measures to overcome them. The purpose of this article has been to summarize some of the knowledge we already possess about interpersonal resources and to outline its application to certain problems of modern society. It has been shown that when resources are classified into six categories and plotted on a two-coordinate space a definite structural pattern emerges. The position of each resource class in the structure appears related to certain properties which in turn affect differentially the exchange of resources in an urban environment. The structural charateristics of resources provide a theoretical basis for the understanding and solution of social problems in modern culture."

The hypothesis that breakage became a more important component of selection in the middle of the Mesozoic Era is supported by the finding that frequencies of breakage-induced shell repair increased from the Pennsylvanian and Triassic periods to the Cretaceous, Miocene, and Recent."

A wide range of host tree species in both temperate and tropical rainforests gain access to these nutrients by putting forth extensive networks of adventitious roots beneath the epiphyte mats they support.

This capacity could be based on a magnetic compass sense, an ability to perceive the sun or patterns of polarized light through the clouds, or on the bees' memory of the diurnal course of the sun with respect to local landmarks. Experiments pitting these alternatives against one another demonstrate that the navigational backup system of bees is based on memory."

Analysis of the crystal structure revealed the crystallo-chemical formula (NH4)3B15O20(OH)8⋅4H2O, with four such formula units in the unit cell. The basic structural unit is the double ring consisting of one BO4 tetrahedron and four BO3 triangles: in ammonioborite three of these units are connected to give trimeric ions [B15O20(OH)8]3-."

The state of the art is reviewed, and some projections about likely future developments are made."
https://openalex.org/W2089089291,"Evidence has been found that the earth is immersed in a large volume of glowing helium ions. This ionic glow, at 304 angstroms, is similar to the geocoronal hydrogen glow in that it extends to very high altitudes, but it is unique in that it is largely confined to the closed field line portion of the magnetosphere. Because of its magnetic containment, this ionic radiation is called the ""magnetoglow."" Observations of the magnetoglow from inside and outside the magnetospheric cavity promise to provide a valuable means of studying the structural dynamics of the magnetosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2095441911,"In the first place I have reviewed the true foundation of Einstein's theory of general relativity, the so-called principle of equivalence, according to which there is no essential difference between ""genuine"" gravitation and inertial forces, well known from accelerated vehicles. By means of a comparison with Gaussian geometry of curved surfaces-the background of Riemannian geometry, the tool used by Einstein for the mathematical formulation of his theory-it is made clear that this principle is incompatible with the idea proposed by Mach and accepted by Einstein as an incitement to his attempt to describe the main situation in the universe as an analogy in three dimensions to the closed surface of a sphere. In the later attempts toward a mathematical description of the universe, where Einstein's cosmology was adapted to the discovery by Hubble that its observed part is expanding, the socalled cosmological postulate has been used as a kind of axiomatic background which, when analyzed, makes it probable that this expansion is shared by a very big, but still bounded system. This implies that our expanding metagalaxy is probably just one of a type of stellar objects in different phases of evolution, some expanding and some contracting. Some attempts toward the description of this evolution are sketched in the article with the hope that further investigation, theoretical and observational, may lead to an interesting advance in this part of astrophysics."

Either these grains were irradiated in space as extralunar dust or the ratio of iron to hydrogen in low-energy (about 1 million electron volts per nucleon) solar particles is orders of magnitude higher than in the photosphere.

The Mn(2+) and Fe(3+) ions are completely ordered and are probably located in the Ca(1)- and Al(II)-sites, respectively, whereas the V(2+) ions probably occupy both Ca(1)- and Ca(2)-sites, with a preference for the Ca(1)-site."
