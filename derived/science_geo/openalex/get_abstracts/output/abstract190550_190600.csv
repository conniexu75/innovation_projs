https://openalex.org/W1965612504,"THE lower volatile acids, acetic, propionic and butyric, have been widely studied in relation to intermediary metabolism1,2. Propionic acid is known to be glucogenic, and sodium propionate has been found to relieve severe hypoglycæmic symptoms in an adrenalectomized ewe; but sodium acetate was without effect3. Butyric acid has usually been studied in relation to the metabolism of fat and the production of ketone bodies4; but there are some suggestions that it may also be implicated in carbohydrate metabolism5. Moreover, Jarrett, Potter and Filsell6 have found that the concentration of blood sugar and of pyruvic acid was increased after sodium butyrate had been injected into the blood-stream of sheep."

The fundamental experiments, confined to the comparison of final yields, did not show whether the observed depression resulted from complete incapacitation of some cells, from an overall lowering of cellular output, or merely from the slowing-down of the process. Similarly, it is not clear whether the challenging inoculum enters all cells at random, or only those which have the potential ability to yield virus. Some of these questions have been answered by the kinetic study of interference, and the results will be reported in full elsewhere; here we propose to point out some peculiarities of the growth curves, as they reveal possible pitfalls in the planning and interpretation of interference experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2087399882,"THE transformation of the two nucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid, one into the other has been postulated by Brachet1, using developing sea urchin embryos as material for the investigation. Ribonucleic acid should be the precursor of deoxyribonucleic acid. These results have been questioned by Villee et al.2 and Abrams3, among others, who show that the amount of total nucleic acid phosphorus is not constant during development. Further, with the aid of phosphorus-32 and carbon-14 respectively, these investigators have demonstrated that the specific activity of deoxyribonucleic acid is much higher, up to fifteen times, than of ribonucleic acid. These results indicate that most of the deoxyribonucleic acid should arise from an endogenous precursor, which is not ribonucleic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2059910040,"To investigate the resistance to diffusion between the two phases of the egg, the 34-hr. isotope of bromine (82Br) as bromide was injected into the white in many eggs and its penetration into the yolk measured after various periods of time. About 5 ml. of the white of the egg to be injected was mixed with ½ ml. of the radioactive bromide in isotonic solution, and injected as uniformly as possible throughout that remaining in the shell. The egg was maintained during the experimental period at 1° C., and, at its conclusion, frozen in a mixture of ether and dry ice. The yolk and white could then be separated cleanly with a sharp blow, and were conveniently diluted and their activities measured with a Geiger-Müller counter dipping into the liquids."

https://openalex.org/W2024934015,"THE procedure of freezing and drying tissues for the purposes of histology is commonly known as the Altmann or Altmann–Gersh method. Altmann published his method in 18901, and Gersh, in 19322, described fundamental improvements in the technique. It is curious that in 1862 the basic principles of the method were described in “L'homme a I'oreille cassee”, a scientific romance by Edmond About, an English translation of which was available in 1867."
