https://openalex.org/W4305015942,"Neural migration is a critical step during brain development that requires the interactions of cell-surface guidance receptors. Cancer cells often hijack these mechanisms to disseminate. Here, we reveal crystal structures of Uncoordinated-5 receptor D (Unc5D) in complex with morphogen receptor glypican-3 (GPC3), forming an octameric glycoprotein complex. In the complex, four Unc5D molecules pack into an antiparallel bundle, flanked by four GPC3 molecules. Central glycan-glycan interactions are formed by N-linked glycans emanating from GPC3 (N241 in human) and C-mannosylated tryptophans of the Unc5D thrombospondin-like domains. MD simulations, mass spectrometry and structure-based mutants validate the crystallographic data. Anti-GPC3 nanobodies enhance or weaken Unc5-GPC3 binding and, together with mutant proteins, show that Unc5/GPC3 guide migrating pyramidal neurons in the mouse cortex, and cancer cells in an embryonic xenograft neuroblastoma model. The results demonstrate a conserved structural mechanism of cell guidance, where finely balanced Unc5-GPC3 interactions regulate cell migration."

However, it is not yet clear whether BaP contributes to the macrophage- and astrocyte-mediated inflammatory response. Methods We examined the acute (up to 72 h) effects of BaP on the expression of antioxidant enzymes (AOEs), cytokines/chemokines, and cytochromes P450 (CYP) enzymes in astrocytic cell lines, SVGA, and chronically HIV-infected U1 macrophage. The treated cells were examined for mRNA, protein levels of CYPs, AOEs superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) and catalase (CAT), cytokines/chemokines, using Western blot, multiplex ELISA, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) by flow cytometry analysis. Results Upon acute exposure, BaP (1 μM) showed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of CYPs (CYP1A1 and CYP1B1), and pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in SVGA cells following BaP for 24, 48, and 72h. In addition, we observed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of SOD1 and CAT at 24h of BaP treatment. In contrast, BaP did not exert any change in the protein expression of AOEs and CYP enzymes. In U1 cells, however, we noticed an interesting increase in the levels of MCP-1 as well as a modest increase in TNFα, IL-8 and IL-1β levels observed at 72 h of BaP treatment but could not reach to statistically significant level. Conclusions Overall, these results suggest that BaP contributes in part to macrophage and astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation by mainly inducing IL-1β and MCP-1 production, which is likely to occur with the involvement of CYP and/or oxidative stress pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4306194581,"Cyclophilins, a type of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, function as important molecular chaperones in a series of biological processes. However, the expression pattern and signal transduction pathway of cyclophilins are still unclear. Here, we showed that the promoter of OsCYP2 could function as a tissue-specific promoter by GUS staining. Moreover, we found that the promoter sequence contained not only core elements but also inducible elements. Then, the ABA-responsive element was used for cDNA library screening, and the transcription factor MYC2-like was identified by a yeast one-hybrid assay and confirmed through an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Furthermore, the relative expression showed that MYC2-like was induced by abscisic acid. In addition, MYC2-like overexpression enhanced salt tolerance in transformants and partially restored the cyp2-RNAi line. In summary, we explored a novel transcriptional signal mediated by MYC2-like, a potential regulator of salt stress-related physiological processes in rice."
https://openalex.org/W4306180602,"Background Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) surveillance as an early warning system (EWS) for monitoring community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings, where diagnostic testing capacity is limited, needs further exploration. We explored the feasibility to conduct a WBE surveillance in Indonesia, one of the global epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic in the middle of 2021, with the fourth largest population in the world where sewer and non-sewered sewage systems are implemented. The feasibility and resource capacity to collect samples on a weekly or fortnightly basis with grab and/or passive sampling methods, as well as to conduct qualitative and quantitative identification of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) using real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) testing of environmental samples were explored. Materials and methods We initiated a routine surveillance of wastewater and environmental sampling at three predetermined districts in Special Region of Yogyakarta Province. Water samples were collected from central and community wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), including manholes flowing to the central WWTP, and additional soil samples were collected for the near source tracking (NST) locations (i.e., public spaces where people congregate). Results We began collecting samples in the Delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia in July 2021. From a 10-week period, 54% (296/544) of wastewater and environmental samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The sample positivity rate decreased in proportion with the reported incidence of COVID-19 clinical cases in the community. The highest positivity rate of 77% in week 1, was obtained for samples collected in July 2021 and decreased to 25% in week 10 by the end of September 2021. Conclusion A WBE surveillance system for SARS-CoV-2 in Indonesia is feasible to monitor the community burden of infections. Future studies testing the potential of WBE and EWS for signaling early outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in this setting are required."
https://openalex.org/W4306194527,"Histological analysis is considered to be the gold standard method of evaluating osseointegration around a bone-implant. However, this method requires invasive specimen preparation and is capable of representing only one plane. By comparison, micro-computed tomography (μCT) is a fast and convenient method that offers three-dimensional information but is hampered by problems related to resolution and artifacts, making it a supplementary method for osseointegration analysis. To verify the reliability of μCT for osseointegration evaluation, this animal model study compared bone-to-implant contact (BIC) ratios obtained by the gold standard histomorphometric method with those obtained by the μCT method, using a rabbit tibia implant model. A sandblasted, large-grit, acid-etched (SLA) implant and a machined surface implant were inserted into each tibia of two rabbits (giving eight implants in total). Bone-implant specimens were analyzed using μCT with a spiral scan technique (SkyScan 1275) and histological sections were prepared thereafter. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed μCT data and four two-dimensional (2D) μCT sections, including one section corresponding to the histologic section and three additional sections rotated 45°, 90°, and 135°, were used to calculate the BIC ratio. The Pearson’s test was used for correlation analysis at a significance level of 0.05. The histomorphometric BIC and the 2D-μCT BIC showed strong correlation (r = 0.762, P = 0.046), whereas the histomorphometric BIC and 3D-μCT BIC did not (r = -0.375, P = 0.385). However, the mean BIC value of three or four 2D-μCT sections showed a strong correlation with the 3D-μCT BIC (three sections: r = 0.781, P = 0.038; four sections: r = 0.804, P = 0.029). The results of this animal model study indicate that μCT can be used to complement the histomorphometric method in bone-implant interface analyses. With the limitations of this study, 3D-μCT analysis may even have a superior aspect in that it eliminates random variables that arise as a consequence of the selected cutting direction."
https://openalex.org/W4306194572,"Keratoconus (KC) is a multifactorial progressive ectatic disorder characterized by local thinning of the cornea, leading to decreased visual acuity due to irregular astigmatism and opacities. Despite the evolution of advanced imaging methods, the exact etiology of KC remains unknown. Our aim was to investigate the involvement of corneal epithelium in the pathophysiology of the disease. Corneal epithelial samples were collected from 23 controls and from 2 cohorts of patients with KC: 22 undergoing corneal crosslinking (early KC) and 6 patients before penetrating keratoplasty (advanced KC). The expression of genes involved in the epidermal terminal differentiation program and of the oxidative stress pathway was assessed by real time PCR analysis. Presence of some of the differentially expressed transcripts was confirmed at protein level using immunofluorescence on controls and advanced KC additional corneal samples. We found statistically significant under-expression in early KC samples of some genes known to be involved in the mechanical resistance of the epidermis ( KRT 16, KRT14 , SPRR1A , SPRR2A , SPRR3 , TGM1 and TGM5 ) and in oxidative stress pathways ( NRF2 , HMOX1 and HMOX2 ), as compared to controls. In advanced KC samples, expression of SPRR2A and HMOX1 was reduced. Decreased expression of keratin (KRT)16 and KRT14 proteins was observed. Moreover, differential localization was noted for involucrin, another protein involved in the epidermis mechanical properties. Finally, we observed an immunofluorescence staining for the active form of NRF2 in control epithelia that was reduced in KC epithelia. These results suggest a defect in the mechanical resistance and the oxidative stress defense possibly mediated via the NRF2 pathway in the corneal keratoconic epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W4306194623,"Logistic regression (LR) is the most common prediction model in medicine. In recent years, supervised machine learning (ML) methods have gained popularity. However, there are many concerns about ML utility for small sample sizes. In this study, we aim to compare the performance of 7 algorithms in the prediction of 1-year mortality and clinical progression to AIDS in a small cohort of infants living with HIV from South Africa and Mozambique. The data set (n = 100) was randomly split into 70% training and 30% validation set. Seven algorithms (LR, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Elastic Net) were compared. The variables included as predictors were the same across the models including sociodemographic, virologic, immunologic, and maternal status features. For each of the models, a parameter tuning was performed to select the best-performing hyperparameters using 5 times repeated 10-fold cross-validation. A confusion-matrix was built to assess their accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RF ranked as the best algorithm in terms of accuracy (82,8%), sensitivity (78%), and AUC (0,73). Regarding specificity and sensitivity, RF showed better performance than the other algorithms in the external validation and the highest AUC. LR showed lower performance compared with RF, SVM, or KNN. The outcome of children living with perinatally acquired HIV can be predicted with considerable accuracy using ML algorithms. Better models would benefit less specialized staff in limited resources countries to improve prompt referral in case of high-risk clinical progression."
https://openalex.org/W4306247768,"The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing public health emergency has emphasized the need to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The human microbiome has been shown to regulate the host immune system and may influence host susceptibility to viral infection, as well as disease severity. Several studies have assessed whether compositional alterations in the nasopharyngeal microbiota are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the results of these studies were varied, and many did not account for disease severity. This study aims to examine whether compositional differences in the nasopharyngeal microbiota are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection status and disease severity.We performed Nanopore full-length 16S rRNA sequencing on 194 nasopharyngeal swab specimens from hospitalized and community-dwelling SARS-CoV-2-infected and uninfected individuals. Sequence data analysis was performed using the BugSeq 16S analysis pipeline.We found significant beta (PERMANOVA p < 0.05), but not alpha (Kruskal-Wallis p > 0.05) diversity differences in the nasopharyngeal microbiota among our study groups. We identified several differentially abundant taxa associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection status and disease severity using ALDEx2. Finally, we observed a trend towards higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in specimens from hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.This study identified several alterations in the nasopharyngeal microbiome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection status and disease severity. Understanding the role of the microbiome in infection susceptibility and severity may open new avenues of research for disease prevention and treatment."

https://openalex.org/W4306180616,"Norovirus and sapovirus are important causes of childhood acute gastroenteritis (AGE). Breastfeeding prevents AGE generally; however, it is unknown if breastfeeding prevents AGE caused specifically by norovirus and sapovirus.We investigated the association between breastfeeding and norovirus or sapovirus AGE episodes in a birth cohort. Weekly data on breastfeeding and AGE episodes were captured during the first year of life. Stools were collected from children with AGE and tested by RT-qPCR for norovirus and sapovirus. Time-dependent Cox models estimated associations between weekly breastfeeding and time to first norovirus or sapovirus AGE.From June 2017 to July 2018, 444 newborns were enrolled in the study. In the first year of life, 69 and 34 children experienced a norovirus and a sapovirus episode, respectively. Exclusive breastfeeding lasted a median of 2 weeks, and any breastfeeding lasted a median of 43 weeks. Breastfeeding in the last week did not prevent norovirus (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.62, 1.92) or sapovirus (HR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.82, 1.21) AGE in a given week, adjusting for household sanitation, consumption of high-risk foods, and mother's and child's histo-blood group phenotypes. Maternal secretor-positive phenotype was protective against norovirus AGE, whereas child's secretor-positive phenotype was a risk factor for norovirus AGE.Exclusive breastfeeding in this population was short-lived, and no conclusions could be drawn about its potential to prevent norovirus or sapovirus AGE. Non-exclusive breastfeeding did not prevent norovirus or sapovirus AGE in the first year of life. However, maternal secretor-positive phenotype was associated with a reduced hazard of norovirus AGE."
https://openalex.org/W4306180743,"To explore risk profiles of the different types of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH >500ml or severe PPH >1500ml) and their recurrence risks in a subsequent delivery.With data from The Medical Birth Registry of Norway and Statistics Norway we performed a population-based cohort study including all singleton deliveries in Norway from 1967-2017. Multilevel logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratio (OR), with 95% confidence interval (CI), with different PPH types (PPH >500ml or PPH >1500ml (severe PPH) combined with retained placenta, uterine atony, obstetric trauma, dystocia, or undefined cause) as outcomes.We identified 277 746 PPH cases of a total of 3 003 025 births (9.3%) from 1967 to 2017. Retained placenta (and/or membranes) was most often registered as severe PPH (29.3%). Maternal, fetal, and obstetric characteristics showed different associations with the PPH types. Male sex of the neonate was associated with reduced risk of PPH. This effect was strongest on PPH due to retained placenta (adjusted OR, (aOR): 0.80, 95% CI 0.78-0.82), atony (aOR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.90-0.93) and PPH with undefined cause (aOR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.95-0.97). Previous cesarean section showed a strong association with PPH due to dystocia (aOR of 13.2, 95% CI: 12.5-13.9). Recurrence risks were highest for the same type: PPH associated with dystocia (aOR: 6.8, 95% CI: 6.3-7.4), retained placenta and/or membranes (aOR: 5.9, 95% CI: 5.5-6.4), atony (aOR: 4.0, 95% CI: 3.8-4.2), obstetric trauma (aOR: 3.9, 95% CI: 3.5-4.3) and PPH of undefined cause (aOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 2.1-2.3).Maternal, fetal and obstetric characteristics had differential effects on types of PPH. Recurrence differed considerably between PPH types. Retained placenta was most frequently registered with severe PPH, and showed strongest effect of sex; delivery of a boy was associated with lower risk of PPH. Previous cesarean increased the risk of PPH due to dystocia."
https://openalex.org/W4306194565,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly influenced all modes of transportation. However, it is still unclear how the pandemic affected the demand for ridesourcing services and whether these effects varied between small towns and large cities. We analyzed over 220 million ride requests in the City of Chicago (population: 2.7 million), Illinois, and 52 thousand in the Town of Innisfil (population: 37 thousand), Ontario, to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the ridesourcing demand in the two locations. Overall, the pandemic resulted in fewer trips in areas with higher proportions of seniors and more trips to parks and green spaces. Ridesourcing demand was adversely affected by the stringency index and COVID-19-related variables, and positively affected by vaccination rates. However, compared to Innisfil, ridesourcing services in Chicago experienced higher reductions in demand, were more affected by the number of hospitalizations and deaths, were less impacted by vaccination rates, and had lower recovery rates."
https://openalex.org/W4306247667,"Statistical learning of physical stimulus characteristics is important for the development of cognitive systems like language and music. Rhythm patterns are a core component of both systems, and rhythm is key to language acquisition by infants. Accordingly, the physical stimulus characteristics that yield speech rhythm in ""Babytalk"" may also describe the hierarchical rhythmic relationships that characterize human music and song. Computational modelling of the amplitude envelope of ""Babytalk"" (infant-directed speech, IDS) using a demodulation approach (Spectral-Amplitude Modulation Phase Hierarchy model, S-AMPH) can describe these characteristics. S-AMPH modelling of Babytalk has shown previously that bands of amplitude modulations (AMs) at different temporal rates and their phase relations help to create its structured inherent rhythms. Additionally, S-AMPH modelling of children's nursery rhymes shows that different rhythm patterns (trochaic, iambic, dactylic) depend on the phase relations between AM bands centred on ~2 Hz and ~5 Hz. The importance of these AM phase relations was confirmed via a second demodulation approach (PAD, Probabilistic Amplitude Demodulation). Here we apply both S-AMPH and PAD to demodulate the amplitude envelopes of Western musical genres and songs. Quasi-rhythmic and non-human sounds found in nature (birdsong, rain, wind) were utilized for control analyses. We expected that the physical stimulus characteristics in human music and song from an AM perspective would match those of IDS. Given prior speech-based analyses, we also expected that AM cycles derived from the modelling may identify musical units like crotchets, quavers and demi-quavers. Both models revealed an hierarchically-nested AM modulation structure for music and song, but not nature sounds. This AM modulation structure for music and song matched IDS. Both models also generated systematic AM cycles yielding musical units like crotchets and quavers. Both music and language are created by humans and shaped by culture. Acoustic rhythm in IDS and music appears to depend on many of the same physical characteristics, facilitating learning."
https://openalex.org/W4306247683,"Mutation in the CTNNB1 gene, leading to a deregulation of the WTN/β-catenin pathway, is a common feature of desmoid tumors (DTs). Many β-catenin inhibitors have recently been tested in clinical studies; however, BC2059 (also referred as Tegavivint), a selective inhibitor of nuclear β-catenin that works through binding TBL-1, is the only one being evaluated in a clinical study, specifically for treatment of desmoid tumor patients. Preclinical studies on BC2059 have shown activity in multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia and osteosarcoma. Our preclinical studies provide data on the efficacy of BC2059 in desmoid cell lines, which could help provide insight regarding antitumor activity of this therapy in desmoid tumor patients. In vitro activity of BC2059 was evaluated using desmoid tumor cell lines. Ex vivo activity of BC2059 was assessed using an explant tissue culture model. Pharmacological inhibition of the nuclear β-catenin activity using BC2059 markedly inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion of mutated DT cells, but with lower effect on wild-type DTs. The decrease in cell viability of mutated DT cells caused by BC2059 was due to apoptosis. Treatment with BC2059 led to a reduction of β-catenin-associated TBL1 in all mutated DT cells, resulting in a reduction of nuclear β-catenin. mRNA and protein levels of AXIN2, a β-catenin target gene, were also found to be downregulated after BC2059 treatment. Taken together, our results demonstrate that nuclear β-catenin inhibition using BC2059 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for desmoid tumor treatment, especially in patients with CTNNB1 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W4306194525,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a cancer associated with asbestos exposure and its diagnosis is challenging due to the moderate sensitivities of the available methods. In this regard, miR-103a-3p was considered to increase the sensitivity of established biomarkers to detect MPM. Its behavior and diagnostic value in the Mexican population has not been previously evaluated. In 108 confirmed MPM cases and 218 controls, almost all formerly exposed to asbestos, we quantified miR-103-3a-3p levels in leukocytes using quantitative Real-Time PCR, together with mesothelin and calretinin measured in plasma by ELISA. Sensitivity and specificity of miR-103-3a-3p alone and in combination with mesothelin and calretinin were determined. Bivariate analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlation. Non-conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate the area under curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for the combination of biomarkers. Mesothelin and calretinin levels were higher among cases, remaining as well among males and participants ≤60 years old (only mesothelin). Significant differences for miR-103a-3p were observed between male cases and controls, whereas significant differences between cases and controls for mesothelin and calretinin were observed in men and women. At 95.5% specificity the individual sensitivity of miR-103a-3p was 4.4% in men, whereas the sensitivity of mesothelin and calretinin was 72.2% and 80.9%, respectively. Positive correlations for miR-103a-3p were observed with age, environmental asbestos exposure, years with diabetes mellitus, and glucose levels, while negative correlations were observed with years of occupational asbestos exposure, creatinine, erythrocytes, direct bilirubin, and leukocytes. The addition of miR-103a-3p to mesothelin and calretinin did not increase the diagnostic performance for MPM diagnosis. However, miR-103a-3p levels were correlated with several characteristics in the Mexican population."
https://openalex.org/W4306247792,"Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can be prevented by vaccination. Exposure to blood or body fluids poses a high risk of transmission of HBV in health care workers (HCWs). This study aimed to determine the prevalence of markers of exposure, susceptibility, and protection to HBV infection in HCWs in Beira, Mozambique. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between June and August 2020 in Beira City, Mozambique, in HCWs based on self-administered questionnaires and blood samples. Plasma samples were tested for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc), antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) and HBV viral load (HBV DNA). Results Most of the 315 HCWs in the study were nurses (125; 39.7%). Of the HCWs, 5.1% (16; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.9 to 8.1%) were infected by HBV (HBsAg and/or HBV DNA positive). Occult HBV infection (OBI) (HBV DNA positive and HBsAg negative) was found in 0.3% (1; 95% CI: 0.0 to 1.8%) of participants; 27.9% (88; 95% CI: 23.1 to 33.2%) were susceptible (negative for all markers), 6.3% (20; 95% CI: 3.9 to 9.6) were immune due to natural infection (anti-HBs and anti-HBc positive only), while 60% (189; 95% CI: 54.4 to 65.5) were immune due to vaccination (anti-HBs positive only). Conclusion This study showed a high intermediate prevalence of chronic hepatitis B among healthcare workers in Beira City, Central Mozambique, and one-third of healthcare workers were susceptible to HBV infection. There is a need to implement a national hepatitis B screening and vaccination strategy among healthcare workers in Mozambique."
https://openalex.org/W4306247932,"To evaluate certain two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound signs as predictors of massive peri-operative blood loss (PBL) in pregnant women with placenta previa suspicious of PAS disorder.A single center retrospective study was done in pregnant women who had undergone prenatal diagnosis with 2D ultrasound grey scale and color Doppler using the EW-AIP (which has been changed to IS-PAS (International Society for the Placenta Accreta Spectrum)) criteria between January 2007 and May 2021. The patients were divided into 2 groups, non-massive hemorrhage with PBL ≤ 2500 mL and massive PBL >2500 mL. All PAS cases had pathological confirmation. Ultrasound signs and hemorrhagic outcomes were compared between the two groups. A PAS scoring system to predict massive PBL was constructed and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to evaluate the efficacy of the scoring system.Of 534 women, 146 (28.3%) had PBL > 2500 mL and 388 (71.7%) had PBL ≤ 2500 mL. In the massive PBL group, 101 (69.2%) were diagnosed as PAS and 45 (30.8%) as placenta previa alone. From 10 evaluated 2D ultrasound signs, 3 had the highest odds ratios (ORs) associated with massive PBL, 'focal exophytic mass' OR 8.17 (p = 0.024), 'placental bulge' OR 2.47 (p = 0.011), and 'placental lacunae feeder vessels' OR 2.38 (p = 0.01). When using the PAS scoring system, the AUC to predict massive PBL was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85,).Our PAS scoring system based on 2-dimensional ultrasound signs combined with grey scale and color Doppler is useful to predict massive PBL and can help optimize pre-operative management in cases of previa suspicious of PAS."
https://openalex.org/W4306180625,"Salmonella is an intracellular pathogen causing significant morbidity and mortality. Its ability to grow inside macrophages is important to virulence, and is dependent on the activation state of the macrophages. Classically activated M1 macrophages are non-permissive for Salmonella growth, while alternatively activated M2 macrophages are permissive for Salmonella growth. Here we showed that endotoxin-primed macrophages (M EP ), such as those associated with sepsis, showed similar levels of Salmonella resistance to M1 macrophages after 2 hr of intracellular infection, but at the 4 hr and 24 hr time points were susceptible like M2 macrophages. To understand this mechanistically, transcriptomic sequencing, RNA-Seq, was performed. This showed that M1 and M EP macrophages that had not been exposed to Salmonella , demonstrated a process termed here as primed activation, in expressing relatively higher levels of particular anti-infective genes and pathways, including the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway. In contrast, in M2 macrophages these genes and pathways were largely expressed only in response to infection. Conversely, in response to infection, M1 macrophages, but not M EP macrophages, modulated additional genes known to be associated with susceptibility to Salmonella infection, possibly contributing to the differences in resistance at later time points. Application of the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib before infection reduced resistance in M1 macrophages, supporting the importance of early JAK-STAT signalling in M1 resistance to Salmonella ."
https://openalex.org/W4306180639,"This study explores how the US stock market reacted to the news of a successful development of vaccine by Pfizer and Biontech on November 9, 2020. In particular, the study analyses the effect of the vaccine announcement on 11 sector indices and 79 subsector indices. A key contribution of the present study is to provide a deeper subsector level of analysis lacking in existing literature. An event study approach is applied in identifying abnormal returns due to the November 9th vaccine announcement. Several event periods (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0-1, 0-3) are analysed to provide a more complete picture of the effects. Based on analysis, it is established that there are considerable inter and intra sectoral variations in the impact of the vaccine news. The results show that the impact follows a clear pattern. The sectors that were hit hardest by the pandemic such as energy, financials, as well as subsectors like hotels and casinos, benefited the most from positive vaccine news. Subsectors that gained from the pandemic such as airfreight, household appliances and computers and electronics retail were depressed the most by the news. These findings suggest that while the availability of vaccines is expected to help steer economies gradually to normalcy, the re-adjustment is likely to be asymmetric across subsectors. While some subsectors expect to expand as these industries recover from the contraction inflicted by the COVID-19 environment, other subsectors expect adjustment losses as these industries shed off the above average gains driven by the COVID-19 environment."
https://openalex.org/W4306180647,"Tendons are composed of a heterogeneous cell environment, with Scleraxis-lineage (ScxLin) cells being the predominant population. Although ScxLin cells are required for maintenance of tendon homeostasis, their functions during tendon healing are unknown. To this end, we first characterized the spatiotemporal dynamics of ScxLin cells during tendon healing, and identified that the overall ScxLin pool continuously expands up to early remodeling healing phase. To better define the function of ScxLin cells during the late proliferative phase of healing, we inducibly depleted ScxLin cells from day 14-18 post-surgery using the Scx-Cre; Rosa-DTR mouse model, with local administration of diphtheria toxin inducing apoptosis of ScxLin cells in the healing tendon. At D28 post-surgery, ScxLin cell depleted tendons (DTRScxLin) had substantial impairments in structure and function, relative to WT, demonstrating the importance of ScxLin cells during tendon healing. Next, bulk RNAseq was utilized to identify the underlying mechanisms that were impaired with depletion and revealed that ScxLin depletion induced molecular and morphological stagnation of the healing process at D28. However, this stagnation was transient, such that by D56 tendon mechanics in DTRScxLin were not significantly different than wildtype repairs. Collectively, these data offer fundamental knowledge on the dynamics and roles of ScxLin cells during tendon healing."
https://openalex.org/W4306180744,"What is the relation between seed quality and food security? Here we built a summary diagram that links the development stages of the seeds with their potential of providing grain yield. This idea was tested using cowpea as a model crop, grown in a tropical environment. Initially, seed quality attributes such as water content, dry weight, germination, vigor, and longevity were characterized during seed development. With this, we were able to elucidate at which point the late maturation phase and the acquisition of seed with superior physiological quality starts. From these data, the proposed summary diagram highlighted the seed quality as a technological basis for generating a more productive plant community. It also showed that only seeds with a high-quality profile have a better chance to establishment in an increasingly challenging agricultural environment. Overall, we bring the concept that cowpea seeds with superior quality besides being the essential input for tropical agriculture is also a strategy that can contribute food security."
https://openalex.org/W4306194373,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute phase protein, which undergoes structural changes and deposits in the extracellular matrix, causing organ damage. Systemic AA amyloidosis is a relatively common amyloid subtype among the more than 30 amyloid subtypes, but the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the tissue distribution of SAA derived peptides in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens of human myocardium with amyloidosis using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS). In the whole SAA protein, four trypsin-digested peptides in the range of SAA2-67 were visualized and the N-terminal peptide; SAA2-15, was selectively localized in the Congo red-positive region. The C-terminal peptides; SAA47-62, SAA48-62, and SAA63-67 were detected not only in the Congo red-positive region but also in the surrounding negative region. Our results demonstrate that the N-terminal SAA2-15 plays a critical role in the formation of AA amyloid fibril, as previously reported. Roles of the C-terminal peptides require further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4306194487,"Burns are physically debilitating and potentially fatal injuries. The most common etiology of burn wound infections in the US is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is particularly recalcitrant when biofilms form. The current standard of care, silver sulfadiazine (SSD) is effective in reducing bacterial load, but less effective in improving burn wound healing. New treatments that can manage infection while simultaneously improving healing would provide a benefit in the treatment of burns. Porcine models are frequently used as a model for human wound healing but can be expensive due to the need to separate wounds to avoid cross contamination. The porcine model developed in this study offers the capability to study multiple partial thickness burn wound (PTBW) sites on a single animal with minimal crosstalk to study wound healing, infection, and inflammation. The current study evaluates a wound rinse and a wound gel formulated with a non-toxic, polycationic chitosan derivative that is hypothesized to manage infection while also promoting healing, providing a potential alternate to SSD. Studies in vitro and in this PTBW porcine model compare treatment with the chitosan derivative formulations to SSD. The wound rinse and wound gel are observed to disrupt mature MRSA biofilms in vitro and reduce the MRSA load in viv o when compared to that of the standard of care. In vivo data further show increased re-epithelialization and faster healing in burns treated with wound rinse/gel as compared to SSD. Taken together, the data demonstrate the potential of the wound rinse/gel to significantly enhance healing, promote re-epithelialization, and reduce bacterial burden in infected PTBW using an economical porcine model."
https://openalex.org/W4306194497,"While there is evidence of urban/rural disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage, there is limited data on the influence of other place-based variables. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed population-based linked administrative health data (publicly-funded health insurance database and province-wide immunization repository) to examine vaccination coverage for 3,945,103 residents aged 12 years and above in Alberta, Canada. We used multilevel logistic regression to examine the association of vaccination coverage with various place-based variables. Furthermore, we combined information on vaccine coverage and neighborhood level COVID-19 risk to categorize forward sortation areas (FSAs) into six categories. After 4 months of widely available COVID-19 vaccine, coverage varied widely between rural and urban areas (58% to 73%) and between geographic health authority zones (55.8% to 72.8%). Residents living in neighborhoods with lower COVID-19 disease incidence had the lowest vaccination coverage (63.2%), while coverage in higher incidence neighborhoods ranged from 68.3% to 71.9%. The multilevel logistic regression model indicated that residence in metro (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.37; 95% CI: 1.31–1.42) and urban areas (aOR 1.11; 95% CI: 1.08–1.14) was associated with higher vaccine coverage than residence in rural areas. Similarly, residence in Edmonton, Calgary, and South health zones was associated with higher vaccine coverage compared to residence in Central zone. Higher income neighborhoods reported higher vaccine coverage than the lowest-income neighborhoods, and the highest COVID-19 risk neighborhoods reported higher vaccine coverage than the lowest risk neighborhoods (aOR 1.52; 95% CI: 1.12–2.05). In the first four months of wider vaccine availability in Alberta, COVID-19 vaccine coverage varied according to various place-based characteristics. Vaccine distribution strategies need to consider place-based variables for program prioritization and delivery."
https://openalex.org/W4306247656,"Leishmaniasis is endemic in Morocco where both cutaneous and visceral forms coexist. To date, anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) determinants remain poorly investigated in Morocco. However, the disease risk factors identification is vital to determine the specific preventive process. In this aim, a case-control study was conducted in the main active ACL foci in central Morocco. Epidemiological data were extracted from bulletins, registers and annual reports of the regional direction of Health offices. The socioeconomic and environmental data were collected from epidemiological surveys, completed by a questionnaire intended for accessible positive population and control people selected from the cases' entourage. The study included 258 cases and 395 controls. Our results showed that many socioeconomic factors were associated with ACL in Morocco such as the rural habitation (OR = 4.163; 95% CI: 2.91-5.96), movement to endemic area (OR = 4.53; 95% CI: 3.03-6.77), provenance from leishmaniasis foci (in Essaouira focus OR = 5.34; 95% CI: 1.19-24.03) and poverty. In addition, environmental factors like proximity of vegetation (OR = 2.45; 95% CI: 1.14-5.25), poor domestic hygiene, particularly the absence of sewage system/waste management (OR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.35-1.96), and presence of animals (OR = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.14-5.25) increase the risk of ACL in Morocco. Except for Matrimonial status (married people, OR = 4.11; 95% CI: 1.80-9.41), there is however no significant association of the disease with the other socio-demographic factors in the study area (p>0.05). These several risk factors must be taken in consideration to prevent this disease through multidisciplinary collaboration and community participation."
https://openalex.org/W4306247975,"Objectives In England, Electronic Palliative Care Coordination Systems (EPaCCS) were introduced in 2008 to support care coordination and delivery in accordance with patient preferences. Despite policy supporting their implementation, there has been a lack of rigorous evaluation of EPaCCS and it is not clear how they have been translated into practice. This study sought to examine the current national implementation of EPaCCS, including their intended impact on patient and service outcomes, and barriers and facilitators for implementation. Methods We conducted a national cross-sectional online survey of end-of-life care commissioning leads for Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England. We enquired about the current implementation status of EPaCCS, their role in information sharing and intended impact, and requested routine patient-level data relating to EPaCCS. Results Out of 135 CCGs, 85 (63.0%) responded, with 57 (67.1%) having operational EPaCCS. Use of EPaCCS were confined to healthcare providers with most systems (67%) not supporting information sharing with care homes and social care providers. Most systems (68%) sought to facilitate goal concordant care, although there was inconsonance between intended impacts and monitoring measures used. Common challenges to implementation included healthcare professionals’ limited engagement. Only one-third of patients had an EPaCCS record at death with limited recording of patient preferences. Conclusions Critical gaps exist in engagement with EPaCCS and their ability to facilitate information sharing across care providers. The limited alignment between stated goals of EPaCCS and their monitoring impedes efforts to understand which characteristics of systems can best support care delivery."
https://openalex.org/W4306180604,"Background Accurate breath detection is essential for the computation of outcomes in the multiple-breath washout (MBW) technique. This is particularly important in young children, where irregular breathing is common, and the designation of inspirations and expirations can be challenging. Aim To investigate differences between a commercial and a novel breath-detection algorithm and to characterize effects on MBW outcomes in children. Methods We replicated the signal processing and algorithms used in Spiroware software (v3.3.1, Eco Medics AG). We developed a novel breath detection algorithm (custom) and compared it to Spiroware using 2,455 nitrogen (N 2 ) and 325 sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) trials collected in infants, children, and adolescents. Results In 83% of N 2 and 32% of SF 6 trials, the Spiroware breath detection algorithm rejected breaths and did not use them for the calculation of MBW outcomes. Our custom breath detection algorithm determines inspirations and expirations based on flow reversal and corresponding CO 2 elevations, and uses all breaths for data analysis. In trials with regular tidal breathing, there were no differences in outcomes between algorithms. However, in 10% of pre-school children tests the number of breaths detected differed by more than 10% and the commercial algorithm underestimated the lung clearance index by up to 21%. Conclusion Accurate breath detection is challenging in young children. As the MBW technique relies on the cumulative analysis of all washout breaths, the rejection of breaths should be limited. We provide an improved algorithm that accurately detects breaths based on both flow reversal and CO 2 concentration."
https://openalex.org/W4306180662,"Emotion lexicons became a popular method for quantifying affect in large amounts of textual data (e.g., social media posts). There are multiple independently developed emotion lexicons which tend to correlate positively with one another but not entirely. Such differences between lexicons may not matter if they are just unsystematic noise, but if there are systematic differences this could affect conclusions of a study. The goal of this paper is to examine whether two extensively used, apparently domain-independent lexicons for emotion analysis would give the same answer to a theory-driven research question. Specifically, we use the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (NRC). As an example, we investigate whether older people have more positive expression through their language use. We examined nearly 5 million tweets created by 3,573 people between 18 to 78 years old and found that both methods show an increase in positive affect until age 50. After that age, however, according to LIWC, positive affect drops sharply, whereas according to NRC, the growth of positive affect increases steadily until age 65 and then levels off. Thus, using one or the other method would lead researchers to drastically different theoretical conclusions regarding affect in older age. We unpack why the two methods give inconsistent conclusions and show this was mostly due to a particular class of words: those related to politics. We conclude that using a single lexicon might lead to unreliable conclusions, so we suggest that researchers should routinely use at least two lexicons. If both lexicons come to the same conclusion then the research evidence is reliable, but if not then researchers should further examine the lexicons to find out what difference might be causing inconclusive result."
https://openalex.org/W4306180667,"Acacia (Leguminosae, Caesalpinioideae, mimosoid clade) is the largest and most widespread genus of plants in the Australian flora, occupying and dominating a diverse range of environments, with an equally diverse range of forms. For a genus of its size and importance, Acacia currently has surprisingly few genomic resources. Acacia pycnantha, the golden wattle, is a woody shrub or tree occurring in south-eastern Australia and is the country's floral emblem. To assemble a genome for A. pycnantha, we generated long-read sequences using Oxford Nanopore Technology, 10x Genomics Chromium linked reads, and short-read Illumina sequences, and produced an assembly spanning 814 Mb, with a scaffold N50 of 2.8 Mb, and 98.3% of complete Embryophyta BUSCOs. Genome annotation predicted 47,624 protein-coding genes, with 62.3% of the genome predicted to comprise transposable elements. Evolutionary analyses indicated a shared genome duplication event in the Caesalpinioideae, and conflict in the relationships between Cercis (subfamily Cercidoideae) and subfamilies Caesalpinioideae and Papilionoideae (pea-flowered legumes). Comparative genomics identified a suite of expanded and contracted gene families in A. pycnantha, and these were annotated with both GO terms and KEGG functional categories. One expanded gene family of particular interest is involved in flowering time and may be associated with the characteristic synchronous flowering of Acacia. This genome assembly and annotation will be a valuable resource for all studies involving Acacia, including the evolution, conservation, breeding, invasiveness, and physiology of the genus, and for comparative studies of legumes."
https://openalex.org/W4306194418,"Background Studies on medication safety in pregnancy are increasingly focusing on child neurodevelopmental outcomes. Establishing neurodevelopmental safety is complex due to the range of neurodevelopmental outcomes and the length of follow-up needed for accurate assessment. The aim of this study was to provide an inventory of European data sources for use in pharmacoepidemiologic studies investigating neurodevelopment following maternal medication exposure. Method The EUROmediSAFE inventory of data sources in Europe for evaluating perinatal and long-term childhood risks associated with in-utero exposure to medication was updated by contacting colleagues across 31 European countries, literature review and internet searches. Included data sources must record at least one neurodevelopmental outcome and maternal medication use in pregnancy must be available, either in the data source itself or through linkage with another data source. Information on the domain of neurodevelopment, measure/scale used and the approach to measurement were recorded for each data source. Results Ninety data sources were identified across 14 countries. The majority (63.3%) were created for health surveillance and research with the remaining serving administrative purposes (21.1% healthcare databases,15.6% other administrative databases). Five domains of neurodevelopment were identified—infant development (36 data sources,13 countries), child behaviour (27 data sources, 10 countries), cognition (29 data sources, 12 countries), educational achievement (20 data sources, 7 countries), and diagnostic codes for neurodevelopmental disorders (42 data sources, 11 countries). Thirty-nine data sources, in 12 countries, had information on more than one domain of neurodevelopment. Conclusion This inventory is invaluable to future studies planning to investigate the neurodevelopmental impact of medication exposures during pregnancy. Caution must be used when combining varied approaches to neurodevelopment outcome measurement, the age of children in the data source, and the sensitivity and specificity of the outcome measure selected should be borne in mind."
https://openalex.org/W4306194420,"High-impact temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain may involve brain mechanisms related to maladaptive central pain modulation. We investigated brain responses to stimulation of trigeminal sites not typically associated with TMD pain by applying noxious dentoalveolar pressure to high- and low-impact TMD pain cases and pain-free controls during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifty female participants were recruited and assigned to one of three groups based on the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) and Graded Chronic Pain Scale: controls (n = 17), low-impact (n = 17) and high-impact TMD (n = 16). Multimodal whole-brain MRI was acquired following the Human Connectome Project Lifespan protocol, including stimulus-evoked fMRI scans during which painful dentoalveolar pressure was applied to the buccal gingiva of participants. Group analyses were performed using non-parametric permutation tests for parcellated cortical and subcortical neuroimaging data. There were no significant between-group differences for brain activations/deactivations evoked by the noxious dentoalveolar pressure. For individual group mean activations/deactivations, a gradient in the number of parcels surviving thresholding was found according to the TMD pain grade, with the highest number seen in the high-impact group. Among the brain regions activated in chronic TMD pain groups were those previously implicated in sensory-discriminative and motivational-affective pain processing. These results suggest that dentoalveolar pressure pain evokes abnormal brain responses to sensory processing of noxious stimuli in high-impact TMD pain participants, which supports the presence of maladaptive brain plasticity in chronic TMD pain."

In this study, we report the global results of CKD patient outcomes and a comparison between those treated at the NRHP-UY Units, with those patients who were initially included in the program but did not adhere to follow up.A cohort of not-on dialysis CKD patients included prospectively in the NRHP-UY between October 1st 2004 and September 30th 2017 was followed-up until September 30th 2019. Two groups were compared: a) Nephrocare Group: Patients who had at least one clinic visit during the first year on NRHP-UY (n = 11174) and b) Non-adherent Group: Patients who were informed and accepted to be included but had no subsequent data registered after admission (n = 3485). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee and all patients signed an informed consent. Outcomes were studied with Logistic and Cox´s regression analysis, Fine and Gray competitive risk and propensity-score matching tests.14659 patients were analyzed, median age 70 (60-77) years, 56.9% male. The Nephrocare Group showed improved achievement of therapeutic goals, ESKD was more frequent (HR 2.081, CI 95%1.722-2.514) as planned kidney replacement therapy (KRT) start (OR 2.494, CI95% 1.591-3.910), but mortality and the combined event (death and ESKD) were less frequent (HR 0.671, CI95% 0.628-0.717 and 0.777, CI95% 0.731-0.827) (p = 0.000) compared to the Non-adherent group. Results were similar in the propensity-matched group: ESKD (HR 2.041, CI95% 1.643-2.534); planned kidney replacement therapy (KRT) start (OR 2.191, CI95% 1.322-3.631) death (HR 0.692, CI95% 0.637-0.753); combined event (HR 0.801, CI95% 0.742-0.865) (p = 0.000).Multidisciplinary care within the NRHP-UY is associated with timely initiation of KRT and lower mortality in single outcomes, combined analysis, and propensity-matched analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4306194483,"Background The introduction of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody rapid testing (RT) in resource-limited settings has proven to be a successful intervention to increase access to prevention measures and improve timely linkage to care. However, the quality of testing has not always kept pace with the scale-up of this testing strategy. To monitor the accuracy of HIV RT test results, a national proficiency testing (PT) program was rolled out at selected testing sites in Ghana using the dried tube specimen (DTS) approach. Methods Between 2015 and 2018, 635 HIV testing sites, located in five regions and supported by the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), were enrolled in the HIV PT program of the Ghana Health Service National AIDS/STI Control Programme. These sites offered various services: HIV Testing and Counselling (HTC), prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and Antiretroviral Treatment (ART). The PT panels, composed of six DTS, were prepared by two regional laboratories, using fully characterized plasma obtained from the regional blood banks and distributed to the testing sites. The results were scored by the PT providers according to the predefined acceptable performance criteria which was set at ≥ 95%. Results Seven rounds of PT panels were completed successfully over three years. The number of sites enrolled increased from 205 in round 1 (June 2015) to 635 in round 7 (December 2018), with a noticeable increase in Greater Accra and Eastern regions. The average participation rates of enrolled sites ranged from 88.0% to 98.0% across the PT rounds. By round 7, HTC (257/635 (40.5%)) and PMTCT (237/635 (37.3%)) had a larger number of sites that participated in the PT program than laboratory (106/635 (16.7%)) and ART (12/635 (1.9%)) sites. The average testing performance rate improved significantly from 27% in round 1 to 80% in round 7 (p &lt; 0.001). The highest performance rate was observed for ART (100%), HTC (92%), ANC/PMTCT (90%) and Laboratory (89%) in round 5. Conclusion The DTS PT program showed a significant increase in the participation and performance rates during this period. Sub-optimal performances observed was attributed to non-compliance to the national testing algorithm and testing technique. However, the implementation of review meetings, peer-initiated corrective action, supportive supervisory training, and mentorship proved impactful. The decentralized approach to preparing the PT panels ensured ownership by the region and districts."

Pharmacists delivering the Medication Management Review (MMR) service can have a role in improving this growing global refugees' problem.To assess the effect of the MMR service on adherence to treatment therapy and knowledge of chronic medications for Syrian refugees residing in Jordan.This randomized intervention control single-blinded study was conducted in Jordan. Syrian refugees were recruited and randomized into intervention and control groups. Two home visits were delivered to each participant, at baseline and three months later. All participants completed questionnaires regarding adherence and knowledge. As a part of the MMR service, treatment-related problems (TRPs) were recognized for all patients; recommendations to resolve these TRPs were only delivered to intervention group refugees' physicians; TRPs were corrected. At follow-up, TRPs assessment, adherence and medication knowledge were assessed for all refugee participants.Participants (n = 106; intervention n = 53, control n = 53) had a number of medications and diagnosed chronic diseases of 5.8 ± 2.1 and 2.97 ± 1.16 per participant respectively. A significant improvement in the adherence and knowledge scores were noted in the intervention (P < 0.001 for both) but not the control group (P = 0.229, P = 0.07 respectively).The MMR service can significantly improve refugees' TRPs, adherence to therapy and knowledge of chronic medications. If this approach was extended to the large scale, many refugees in need would be able to access a quality essential health-care service; a step towards achieving universal health coverage.Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04554810."
https://openalex.org/W4306194540,"Background Like other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar has a high burden of stroke. The Malagasy population is unique in sharing both African and Asian ancestry. The proportion of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke types is unknown for this population. Aim Our aim was to establish the proportion of stroke types and known risk factors for the Malagasy population. Methods We conducted a single-center, tertiary-level hospital-based case series. We included all patients with a CT-imaging confirmed stroke who presented at the emergency ward of the study hospital between January 1, 2017, and November 20, 2018. Results Of 223 patients with CT-confirmed stroke, 57.4% (128/223, 95% CI: 51–64%) had an ischemic stroke and 42.6% (95/223, 95% CI: 36–49%) had an intracranial hemorrhage. The majority (89.5%; 85/95, 95% CI: 83–96%) of intracranial hemorrhages were intracerebral; 4.2% (4/95, 95% CI: 0–8%) had a subdural hematoma, 5.3% (5/95, 95% CI: 1–10%) had a subarachnoid hemorrhage, there was one isolated intraventricular hemorrhage (1.1%; 1/95, 95% CI: -1-3%). The prevalence of hypertension among stroke patients was high (86.6%; 187/216, 95% CI: 82–91%). Conclusions Our study is the first to report the proportion of stroke types and known risk factors in Madagascar. We find that the proportion of hemorrhagic strokes was unexpectedly higher than that reported from other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings highlight the need for a country-specific approach to stroke prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation and provide guidance on public health resource allocation in Madagascar."
https://openalex.org/W4306194553,"In sex determination of the crustacean Daphnia magna , male-specific expression of DM-domain transcription factor Doublesex1 (Dsx1) orchestrates the male developmental program triggered by environmental stimuli. We previously identified the CELF1 ortholog as a candidate of proteins associated with the 5’ UTR of the Dsx1α isoform. Here we report the CELF1-dependent suppression of Dsx1 expression in D . magna . During embryogenesis, CELF1 expression was not sexually dimorphic. Silencing of CELF1 led to the activation of Dsx1 expression both in female and male embryos. Overexpression of CELF1 in male embryos resulted in a reduction of Dsx1 expression. By these manipulations of CELF1 expression, the Dsx1 transcript level was not significantly changed. To investigate whether the CELF1 controls Dsx1 expression via its 5’ UTR, we injected the GFP reporter mRNA having intact Dsx1α 5’ UTR or mutated one lacking the GU-rich element (GRE) that is known as a binding site of the CELF1 ortholog. We found that deletion of the GRE significantly increased the reporter gene expression. These results indicate that CELF1 suppresses Dsx1 expression both in females and males, possibly at the post-transcriptional level. We speculate that CELF1 may avoid unintended Dsx1 expression and generation of sexual ambiguity by setting a threshold of Dsx1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W4306194640,"Purpose Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common, prevalent, and underdiagnosed disorder. Its lack of diagnosis and treatment is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Previous screening questionnaires investigated parameters including body mass index, age, neck circumference, and sex, in addition to symptoms. This study aimed to validate a new Italian, self-administered, and easy-to-use six-item questionnaire that evaluates only subjective symptoms. Patients and methods The present study included 2622 patients (male, 2011; female, 611). Patients who were at least 18 years old, spoke Italian, referred to our sleep clinic for possible OSA, and completed the self-administered SANReSP questionnaire were recruited for the study. The predictive performance of the questionnaire was also evaluated. Results Nocturnal study showed 89.9% of OSA patients had apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5/h; 68.7%, AHI ≥ 15/h; and 48.2%, AHI ≥ 30/h. The optimal SANReSP score for AHI ≥ 5/h was &gt;3 with a sensitivity and specificity of 74.76% and 67.92%, respectively, and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.76. For moderate–severe OSA, the optimal SANReSP score was &gt;3 (sensitivity, 78.18%; specificity, 46.53%; ROC, 0.66). For severe OSA, the optimal SANReSP score was &gt;4 (sensitivity, 59.10%; specificity, 64.73%; ROC, 0.65). The probability of OSA increased with higher SANReSP scores (98.7% and 97.9% in men and women, respectively). Conclusion The SANReSP questionnaire is a short, easy-to-use, and self-administered screening tool for OSA. Its performance is similar to that of other widely used questionnaires; furthermore, it is advantageous in that it does not require anthropometric measurements."
https://openalex.org/W4306194649,"Learning techniques involve unraveling regression structures, which aim to analyze in a probabilistic frame the associations across variables of interest. Thus, analyzing fraction and/or proportion data may not be adequate with standard regression procedures, since the linear regression models generally assume that the dependent (outcome) variable is normally distributed. In this manner, we propose a statistical model called unit-Lindley regression model, for the purpose of Statistical Process Control (SPC). As a result, a new control chart tool was proposed, which targets the water monitoring dynamic, as well as the monitoring of relative humidity, per minute, of Copiapó city, located in Atacama Desert (one of the driest non-polar places on Earth), north of Chile. Our results show that variables such as wind speed, 24-hour temperature variation, and solar radiation are useful to describe the amount of relative humidity in the air. Additionally, Information Visualization (InfoVis) tools help to understand the time seasonality of the water particle phenomenon of the region in near real-time analysis. The developed methodology also helps to label unusual events, such as Camanchaca , and other water monitoring-related events."
https://openalex.org/W4306247621,"Background Corona Virus Disease 2019 is a novel respiratory disease commonly transmitted through respiratory droplets. The disease has currently expanded all over the world with differing epidemiologic trajectories. This investigation was conducted to determine the basic clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the disease in Ethiopia. Methods A prospective case-ascertained study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts were conducted. The study included 100 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases reported from May 15, 2020 to June 15, 2020 and 300 close contacts. Epidemiological and clinical information were collected using the WHO standard data collection tool developed first-few cases and contacts investigation. Nasopharyngeal and Oropharyngeal samples were collected by using polystyrene tipped swab and transported to the laboratory by viral transport media maintaining an optimal temperature. Clinical and epidemiological parameters were calculated in terms of ratios, proportions, and rates with 95% CI. Result A total of 400 participants were investigated, 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 300 close contacts of the cases. The symptomatic proportion of cases was 23% (23) (95% CI: 15.2%-32.5%), the proportion of cases required hospitalization were 8% (8) (95%CI: 3.5%-15.2%) and 2% (95%CI: 0.24% - 7.04%) required mechanical ventilation. The secondary infection rate, secondary clinical attack rate, median incubation period and median serial interval were 42% (126) (95% CI: 36.4%-47.8%), 11.7% (35) (95% CI: 8.3%-15.9%), 7 days (IQR: 4–13.8) and 11 days (IQR: 8–11.8) respectively. The basic reproduction number (R O ) was 1.26 (95% CI: 1.0–1.5). Conclusion The proportion of asymptomatic infection, as well as secondary infection rate among close contacts, are higher compared to other studies. The long serial interval and low basic reproduction number might contribute to the observed slow progression of the pandemic, which gives a wide window of opportunities and time to control the spread. Testing, prevention, and control measures should be intensified."
https://openalex.org/W4306247733,"Urbanization is a comprehensive process of mutual influence among the population, economy, society and living environment, and it depends on the synergy of a series of factors. This paper uses the statistical data of 76 counties in Xinjiang from 1996 to 2018 to construct a comprehensive urbanization evaluation system. Based on the entropy method, comprehensive evaluation model and coupling coordination model, from the scales of time and space, this paper discusses the current situation of the coordinated development of population, economy, society and living environment factors in counties in Xinjiang in the process of urbanization. Local spatial autocorrelation analysis is used to further study the spatial agglomeration effect of the coupling and coordination of urbanization development in the counties. The results show the following: (1) The comprehensive urbanization level of 76 counties in Xinjiang has the characteristics of ""center-periphery"" development, and high-level counties are clustered on the northern slopes of the Tian Mountains.

https://openalex.org/W4306247736,"In recent years, China’s “lottery culture” has developed vigorously. Moreover, the investment participation rate of Chinese families in the formal financial market is low, whereas that in the informal financial market is high. Is there a certain relationship between “lottery culture” and family financial decision-making? If so, what is the underlying mechanism? Based on the 2017 CHFS data and lottery sales data of provinces, this study explores the impact of “lottery culture” on household participation in the formal and informal financial markets and the diversity of household financial portfolios. Results show that “lottery culture” can impede household participation in the formal financial market and the diversity of household financial portfolios while promoting household participation in the informal financial market in China. Furthermore, we analyze two channels of “lottery culture” impacts on household financial decisions: (1) risk attitude and (2) human capital. Results illustrate that “lottery culture” can influence household financial decisions by increasing risk tolerance and reducing the human capital of households."
https://openalex.org/W4306247762,"Learning to sequence movements is necessary for skillful interaction with the environment. Neuroplasticity, particularly long-term potentiation (LTP), within sensorimotor networks underlies the acquisition of motor skill. Short-term immobilization of the arm, even less than 12 hours, can reduce corticospinal excitability and increase the capacity for LTP-like plasticity within the contralateral primary motor cortex. However, it is still unclear whether short-term immobilization influences motor skill acquisition. The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of short-term arm immobilization on implicit, sequence-specific motor skill acquisition using a modified Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT). Twenty young, neurotypical adults underwent a single SRTT training session after six hours of immobilization of the non-dominant arm or an equivalent period of no immobilization. Our results demonstrated that participants improved SRTT performance overall after training, but there was no evidence of an effect of immobilization prior to task training on performance improvement. Further, improvements on the SRTT were not sequence-specific. Taken together, motor skill acquisition for sequential, individuated finger movements improved following training but the effect of six hours of immobilization was difficult to discern."
https://openalex.org/W4306247831,"Hemodynamic assessment is crucial after heart transplantation (HTX) or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Gold-standard is invasive assessment via thermodilution (TD). Noninvasive pulse contour analysis (NPCA) is a new technology that is supposed to determine hemodynamics completely noninvasive. We aimed to validate this technology in HTX and LVAD patients and conducted a prospective single-center cohort study.Patients after HTX or LVAD implantation underwent right heart catheterization including TD. NPCA using the CNAP Monitor (V.5.2.14; CNSystems Medizintechnik AG, Graz, Austria) was performed simultaneously. Three TD measurements were compared with simultaneous NPCA measurements for hemodynamic assessment. To describe the agreement between TD and NPCA, Bland-Altman analysis was done.In total, 28 patients were prospectively enrolled (HTX: n = 10, LVAD: n = 18). Bland-Altman analysis revealed a mean bias of +1.05 l/min (limits of agreement ± 4.09 l/min, percentage error 62.1%) for cardiac output (CO). In LVAD patients, no adequate NPCA signal could be obtained. In 5 patients (27.8%), any NPCA signal could be detected, but was considered as low signal quality.In conclusion, according to our limited data in a small cohort of HTX and LVAD patients, NPCA using the CNAP Monitor seems not to be suitable for noninvasive evaluation of the hemodynamic status."
https://openalex.org/W4306247896,"In some situations, e.g., when filling out lottery tickets, it can be advantageous to select random locations. However, people usually have difficulties with this, because they are biased by preferences for certain regions, such as the center of an area. According to ideas from art theory, the preferred regions reflect the hidden structure of perceptual forces within an area. In the present study, these structures were investigated and modeled under different conditions for areas with square and rectangular shape. The general task was to sequentially place a number of dots at random locations in an area by clicking with the computer mouse at corresponding positions on the screen. Whereas in a single-dot condition each dot had to be placed in an empty area, the previously placed dots remained visible in a multiple-dots condition. In three experiments it was found that dots were preferentially placed at the center, the diagonals, and the principal axes. This preference was more pronounced in the single than in the multiple-dot condition. Moreover, sequential analyses revealed that dot placing was not only planned in advance, but that the participants also agreed to some extent in their sequential selections, which produced surprisingly similar sequential spatial patterns across participants, at least for the first dots. Altogether, the results indicate that people have great difficulties with the random selection of locations. Their selections are strongly affected by the attraction of specific regions, by previous selections, and by sequential habits."
https://openalex.org/W4306247936,Breast cancer survivors may experience spinal deformity following breast cancer surgery. This study investigated the long-term effects of breast cancer surgery on whole-spine alignment. This retrospective study included 200 patients who underwent breast cancer surgery and ≥2 anteroposterior standing whole-spine X-rays. The curvature of the spine was measured using the Cobb angle; changes in Cobb angle between X-rays were compared among three groups according to breast cancer surgery type. The mean interval between initial and follow-up X-ray was 28.46 ± 13.39 months. The change in Cobb angle was 0.40 ± 1.65 degrees and the absolute value of that change was 1.25 ± 1.15 degrees in all patients with breast cancer. There were no significant differences in angular change among groups according to breast cancer surgery type. Most patients showed minimal changes in spinal alignment after breast cancer surgery. Our findings indicate that breast cancer surgery does not negatively affect spinal alignment.
https://openalex.org/W4306247982,"The Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS) is widely used as an adjunct to opioid education and naloxone distribution (OEND) for assessing pre- and post-training knowledge. However, the extent to which the OOKS performs comparably for bystander and first responder groups has not been well determined. We used exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) to assess the measurement invariance of an OOKS item subset when used as an OEND training pre-test. We used secondary analysis of pre-test data collected from 446 first responders and 1,349 bystanders (N = 1,795) attending OEND trainings conducted by two county public health departments. Twenty-four items were selected by practitioner/trainer consensus from the original 45-item OOKS instrument with an additional 2 removed owing to low response variation. We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) followed by ESEM to identify a factor structure, which we assessed for configural, metric, and scalar measurement invariance by participant group using the 22 dichotomous items (correct/incorrect) as factor indicators. EFA identified a 3-factor model consisting of items assessing: basic overdose risk information, signs of an overdose, and rescue procedures/advanced overdose risk information. Model fit by ESEM estimation versus confirmatory factor analysis showed the ESEM model afforded a better fit. Measurement invariance analyses indicated the 3-factor model fit the data across all levels of invariance per standard fit statistic metrics. The reduced set of 22 OOKS items appears to offer comparable measurement of pre-training knowledge on opioid overdose risks, signs of an overdose, and rescue procedures for both bystanders and first responders."
https://openalex.org/W4306248015,"Background Millions of workers are potentially exposed to respirable crystalline silica (RCS) which has been associated with several diseases. We updated the mortality experience of a cohort of 2,650 mine and mill workers at four manufacturing facilities to assess cause-specific mortality risks associated with estimated cumulative RCS exposure. Methods Study eligibility was defined as any employee who had ≥1 year of service by 2000, with work history experience available from 1945 through 2004. Vital status and cause of death were ascertained from 1945 through 2015. RCS exposure was estimated across plant-, department-, job-, and time-dependent categories using historic industrial hygiene sampling data and professional judgment. Associations between cumulative RCS (mg/m 3 -years) and cause-specific mortality were examined using Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results In the exposure-response analysis defined on quartiles of cumulative RCS exposure, no increasing trend (p trend = 0.37) in lung cancer mortality (n = 116 deaths) was observed (Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.00 (referent), 1.20, 1.85, 0.92). Mortality risk for non-malignant respiratory disease was increased across quartiles (HR = 1.00, 1.35, 1.89, 1.70; p trend = 0.15), based on 83 deaths. Non-malignant renal disease mortality was increased across quartiles (HR = 1.00, 6.64, 3.79, 3.29; p trend = 0.11), based on 26 deaths. Conclusions After nearly seven decades of follow-up, the exposure-response analyses showed no evidence of a positive trend for lung cancer, and limited evidence of a trend for non-malignant respiratory disease, and non-malignant renal disease mortality as a result of cumulative RCS exposure in this occupational cohort."
https://openalex.org/W4306248180,"We study risk-averse equilibrium bidding in first-price and second-price sealed-bid auctions where bidders have signalling concerns, i.e., they care about how the auction outcome is interpreted by an outside observer. We find that when the winner’s identity and her payment are revealed to the outside observer, risk aversion yields less aggressive bidding behaviour in the second-price sealed-bid auction than in the risk-neutral case. Our analysis explains various revenue ranking reversals relative to the risk-neutral equilibrium observed in a recent experiment by Bos (2021)."
https://openalex.org/W4306248188,"This paper investigates the impact of financial Inclusion on household poverty and vulnerability by constructing a household financial inclusion index using the China Household Finance Survey 2015. It is found that financial Inclusion significantly reduces the probability of poverty and vulnerability of households and has a more significant impact on vulnerable groups such as rural and urban low-income people. Further, financial Inclusion has a more significant effect on poor families that do not receive government support for poverty alleviation and can complement co-insurance mechanisms to help families better cope with vulnerabilities caused by synergistic community shocks. Finally, promoting entrepreneurship and improving risk management capabilities are the main channels of financial Inclusion."
https://openalex.org/W4306248194,"Background Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of anaemia worldwide. Serum ferritin is the most sensitive non-invasive indicator of iron stores but its utility is compromised in inflammatory states as it is an acute phase reactant. This study sought to estimate the burden of iron deficiency in a healthy adult population residing in Kenya and to determine the association between various ferritin cut-offs and anaemia in a population known to have chronic low-grade inflammation. Methods Healthy adults aged 18–65 years were recruited from urban towns in 4 counties in Kenya at average altitudes of 1683-2099m above sea level as part of a global study conducted by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) to determine reference intervals (RIs) for common laboratory tests. We analyzed complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein, iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and ferritin data. Results We obtained data from 528 participants. There were 254 (48.1%) males and 274 females (51.9%). Based on a ferritin cut-off of 15 μg/L and Hb cut-offs of 14.5 g/dL and 12 g/dL, the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia was 0.8% and 7.3% in males and females respectively. The odds of having anaemia was highest if one had a ferritin value less than 15 μg/L with a sensitivity of 28.6% and specificity of 98.4% in males, and sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 78.0% in females. Conclusion Only the ferritin cut-off of 15 ug/L had an association with anaemia where it can be used for ruling out iron deficiency as the cause. Sex specific ferritin cut-offs for diagnosing iron deficiency in adults in sub-Saharan Africa need to be derived by comparing ferritin levels to stainable iron in bone marrow aspirates and trephines in order to ensure that we are using appropriate clinical decision limits."
