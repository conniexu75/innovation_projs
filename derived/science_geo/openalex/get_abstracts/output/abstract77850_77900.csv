This selectivity of image formation is based on a mechanical flying-spot technique. Objects difficult or impossible to see with earlier microscopes, such as unstained cells and cell processes in brains of living salamanders and in excised dorsal root ganglia of frogs, have been observed routinely with this microscope."

https://openalex.org/W2108674264,"SEVERAL people have speculated on the thesis that if a sufficiently high concentration of an insect sex pheromone could be maintained in the atmosphere, the sexes could not find each other for mating purposes1–3 (for a review, see Jacobson4). Their conclusion was that this could lead to control or possibly eradication of the species. In the only large scale experiment to test this principle, gyplure, an analogue of the gypsy moth sex pheromone, was distributed over an island infested with gypsy moths5. Mating of males with females was not prevented; the failure of this experiment was attributed to the presence of a “masking” substance in the synthetic pheromone6. We have for the first time obtained experimental confirmation that pre-mating communication between the sexes can be disrupted by permeating the atmosphere with an insect pheromone. This general phenomenon was demonstrated using Trichoplusia ni (Hübner), the cabbage looper, as the test organism."

https://openalex.org/W2022574952,OUR earlier communication1 presented evidence that important biological consequences accrue from the presence of stable chemical products of radiolysis which are derived from sugar in the ambient culture media of plant cells or tissue explants. These effects became evident because they neutralized the effect of growth stimulatory substances which induce cell division and cause otherwise quiescent cells to grow rapidly. Thus the potency of the effect of radiated sugar could be assayed. We also showed that growth in the presence of the radiolysis products of sugar may result in abnormal mitotic and meiotic chromosomes in other types of material (root tips and pollen mother cells).
https://openalex.org/W2007478268,"GEL electrophoresis in discontinuous buffer systems1 is a valuable method of examining dilute protein solutions. By selecting pH conditions it is possible to concentrate and then separate either cationic or anionic proteins, but only in separate analyses. Thus, the tris-glycine system can be used, in which the running pH is 9.5 and most proteins migrate as anions1. The usual cationic proteins will either not migrate or will move backwards as a large zone equal in size to the origin. Conversely, an acidic system, such as β-alanine-acetate, may be chosen in which cationic proteins migrate at pH 4.0 (ref. 2), but in, this case the anionic proteins are lost to further analysis. Apart from the loss of time and research material necessitated by separate analyses, there is an unavoidable ambiguity about the direction of migration of a particular protein, because it is quite possible for the same protein to migrate as an anion at pH. 9.5 and as a cation at pH. 4.0. Clearly, a single system allowing the simultaneous separation of oppositely charged proteins would be desirable. To this end the method described couples two discontinuous buffer systems which provide concentrating and running conditions for both cationic and anionic proteins in the same sample."

https://openalex.org/W1977754175,"THIS report describes the use of serological techniques to distinguish two morphologically similar pathogenic fungi in soil. Pythium aphanidermatum (Edson) Fitzp. causes damping-off in many plants, including the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) plants1. Recently Dukes et al. reported that this fungus also causes dark brown to black stem cankers on tomato seedlings grown in fields in South Georgia2. Phytophthora parasitica (Dast.) var. nicotianae (B. de Haan) Tucker [ = Phytophthora nicotianae var. nicotianae3] causes black shank of tobacco in this same area of South Georgia4, and has been reported to cause damping-off of tobacco seedlings, as well as a disease of eggplant, tomato and other plants5. It is difficult to differentiate quickly between these two indigenous soil-borne fungi in the vegetative state, whether in culture or in host tissues. To identify these pathogens in host tissue when reproductive structures are lacking, it is necessary to isolate and grow them in culture on media suitable for production of asexual bodies. Some isolates of both species may produce reproductive structures very slowly or not at all6,7. Proper identification of these species thus may require considerable time and effort, especially by workers not familiar with this group of fungi."
