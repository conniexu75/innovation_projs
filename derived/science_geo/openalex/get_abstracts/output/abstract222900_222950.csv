https://openalex.org/W2050643374,"Copper plays a dual role in aerobic organisms, as both an essential and a potentially toxic element. To ensure copper availability while avoiding its toxic effects, organisms have developed complex homeostatic networks to control copper uptake, distribution, and utilization. In eukaryotes, including yeasts and mammals, high affinity copper uptake is mediated by the Ctr family of copper transporters. This work is the first report on the physiological function of copper transport in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We have studied the expression pattern of <i>COPT1</i> in transgenic plants expressing a reporter gene under the control of the <i>COPT1</i> promoter. The reporter gene is highly expressed in embryos, trichomes, stomata, pollen, and root tips. The involvement of COPT1 in copper acquisition was investigated in <i>CaMV35S</i>::<i>COPT1</i> antisense transgenic plants. Consistent with a decrease in <i>COPT1</i> expression and the associated copper deprivation, these plants exhibit increased mRNA levels of genes that are down-regulated by copper, decreased rates of <sup>64</sup>Cu uptake by seedlings and reduced steady state levels of copper as measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy in mature leaves. Interestingly, <i>COPT1</i> antisense plants also display dramatically increased root length, which is completely and specifically reversed by copper addition, and an increased sensitivity to growth inhibition by the copper-specific chelator bathocuproine disulfonic acid. Furthermore, <i>COPT1</i> antisense plants exhibit pollen development defects that are specifically reversed by copper. Taken together, these studies reveal striking plant growth and development roles for copper acquisition by high affinity copper transporters."

Here, we demonstrate that PCGEM1 expression is significantly higher in prostate cancer (CaP) cells of African-American men than in Caucasian-American men (P=0.0002). Further, increased PCGEM1 expression associates with normal prostate epithelial cells of CaP patients with a family history of CaP (P=0.0400). PCGEM1 overexpression in LNCaP and in NIH3T3 cells promotes cell proliferation and a dramatic increase in colony formation, suggesting a biological role of PCGEM1 in cell growth regulation. Taken together, the cell proliferation/colony formation-promoting functions of PCGEM1 and the association of its increased expression with high-risk CaP patients suggest the potential roles of PCGEM1 in CaP onset/progression, especially in these high-risk groups."

https://openalex.org/W2080775051,"Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits, serves as a key regulator of metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. The amount of HIF-1α protein is regulated either by attenuating von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL)-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent 26 S proteasomal degradation or by enhancing cap-dependent mRNA translation, presumably involving a phosphatidyinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt-regulated pathway. In addition, it became apparent that Hsp90 protects HIF-1α from oxygen-independent degradation. Here we present evidence that PI3K/Akt is required for heat shock proteins to stabilize HIF-1α. In pVHL-deficient renal cell carcinoma cells, PI3K inhibition by LY294002 and wortmannin or transfection of either a dominant negative PI3K or a kinase-dead Akt mutant substantially lowered constitutively expressed HIF-1α without altering HIF-1α mRNA. Inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) such as PD98059 or the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 showed no interference. Considering that PI3K inhibitors down-regulated heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) as well as Hsp70 expression and moreover attenuated heat- or hypoxia-induced Hsp70 as well as hypoxia-induced Hsp90 up-regulation we conclude that PI3K inhibition promoted degradation of HIF-1α indirectly by reducing steady state concentrations of Hsp90 and/or Hsp70. HIF-1α co-immunoprecipitated with Hsp90/Hsp70 and direct binding of Hsp70 to the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of HIF-1α was proven by a pull-down assay and a peptide array. PI3K-mediated degradation of HIF-1α was confirmed in HEK 293 cells under hypoxia, suggesting that heat shock proteins constitute an integral component for HIF-1α accumulation. We conclude that PI3K/Akt contributes to HIF-1α stabilization by provoking expression of heat shock proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2072356395,"Anthropogenic aerosols enhance cloud reflectivity by increasing the number concentration of cloud droplets, leading to a cooling effect on climate known as the indirect aerosol effect. Observational support for this effect is based mainly on evidence that aerosol number concentrations are connected with droplet concentrations, but it has been difficult to determine the impact of these indirect effects on radiative forcing. Here we provide observational evidence for a substantial alteration of radiative fluxes due to the indirect aerosol effect. We examine the effect of aerosols on cloud optical properties using measurements of aerosol and cloud properties at two North American sites that span polluted and clean conditions-a continental site in Oklahoma with high aerosol concentrations, and an Arctic site in Alaska with low aerosol concentrations. We determine the cloud optical depth required to fit the observed shortwave downward surface radiation. We then use a cloud parcel model to simulate the cloud optical depth from observed aerosol properties due to the indirect aerosol effect. From the good agreement between the simulated indirect aerosol effect and observed surface radiation, we conclude that the indirect aerosol effect has a significant influence on radiative fluxes."

https://openalex.org/W2015221995,"Plants produce the common isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) through the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids and the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytosol. To assess which pathways contribute DMAPP for cytokinin biosynthesis, metabolites from each isoprenoid pathway were selectively labeled with 13C in Arabidopsis seedlings. Efficient 13C labeling was achieved by blocking the endogenous pathway genetically or chemically during the feed of a 13C labeled precursor specific to the MEP or MVA pathways. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that the prenyl group of trans-zeatin (tZ) and isopentenyladenine is mainly produced through the MEP pathway. In comparison, a large fraction of the prenyl group of cis-zeatin (cZ) derivatives was provided by the MVA pathway. When expressed as fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis cells, four adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferases (AtIPT1, AtIPT3, AtIPT5, and AtIPT8) were found in plastids, in agreement with the idea that the MEP pathway primarily provides DMAPP to tZ and isopentenyladenine. On the other hand, AtIPT2, a tRNA isopentenyltransferase, was detected in the cytosol. Because the prenylated adenine moiety of tRNA is usually of the cZ type, the formation of cZ in Arabidopsis seedlings might involve the transfer of DMAPP from the MVA pathway to tRNA. Distinct origins of large proportions of DMAPP for tZ and cZ biosynthesis suggest that plants are able to separately modulate the level of these cytokinin species.

The biological activity, signal transduction, and metabolism of CKs have long been studied (1Mok D.W. Mok M.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 89-118Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how different classes of CKs are produced in plants and whether such classes of CKs play different roles in plant development. Most natural CKs are derivatives of N6-prenylated adenine. At least two CK species, trans-zeatin (tZ) and isopentenyladenine (iP), are considered to be active forms in Arabidopsis according to the specific recognition by a CK receptor that has recently been identified (2Inoue T. Higuchi M. Hashimoto Y. Seki M. Kobayashi M. Kato T. Tabata S. Shinozaki K. Kakimoto T. Nature. 2001; 409: 1060-1063Google Scholar, 3Yamada H. Suzuki T. Terada K. Takei K. Ishikawa K. Miwa K. Yamashino T. Mizuno T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1017-1023Google Scholar). By contrast, cis-zeatin (cZ) exhibits only low or no activity to this Arabidopsis receptor (2Inoue T. Higuchi M. Hashimoto Y. Seki M. Kobayashi M. Kato T. Tabata S. Shinozaki K. Kakimoto T. Nature. 2001; 409: 1060-1063Google Scholar). In CK biosynthesis, the prenylation of AMP is catalyzed by adenylate isopentenyltransferase (adenylate-IPT; EC 2.5.1.27), which utilizes dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) as a substrate. This enzyme activity, leading to the formation of isopentenyladenine riboside monophosphate (iPRMP), was first demonstrated in a slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum (4Taya Y. Tanaka Y. Nishimura S. Nature. 1978; 271: 545-547Google Scholar). Thereafter, a CK biosynthesis gene, tmr, which encodes adenylate-IPT, was isolated from a crown gall-inducing bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens (5Barry G.F. Rogers S.G. Fraley R.T. Brand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4776-4780Google Scholar, 6Akiyoshi D.E. Klee H. Amasino R.M. Nester E.W. Gordon M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5994-5998Google Scholar). Recently, the enzymatic properties of Arabidopsis adenylate-IPT-like proteins (AtIPT1, AtIPT3–AtIPT8) have been determined (7Takei K. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26405-26410Google Scholar, 8Kakimoto T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 677-685Google Scholar). Unlike tmr, some AtIPTs preferred ADP and ATP, rather than AMP, as a substrate to produce corresponding nucleotide CKs in vitro (8Kakimoto T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 677-685Google Scholar, 9Takei K. Yamaya T. Sakakibara H. J. Plant Res. 2003; 116: 265-269Google Scholar). Hence, we refer to these enzymes as adenosine phosphate-IPTs. Subsequent conversion of iPRMP to iP is catalyzed by 5′-nucleotidase and adenosine nucleosidase (10Chen C.-M. Kristopeit S.M. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 494-498Google Scholar, 11Chen C.-M. Kristopeit S.M. Plant Physiol. 1981; 68: 1020-1023Google Scholar). The conversion of iP into tZ is catalyzed by microsomal trans-hydroxylase, which is probably a P450 monooxygenase (12Chen C.-M. Leisner S.M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 442-446Google Scholar). On the other hand, the tRNA-dependent CK biosynthesis pathway has also been proposed in plants, as some tRNA species contain an N6-prenylated adenine moiety, which, by hydrolysis, is capable of forming CKs (13Murai N. Mok D.W.S. Mok M.C. Cytokinins: Chemistry, Activity, and Function. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 87-99Google Scholar). The prenylation of tRNA is catalyzed by tRNA isopentenyltransferase (tRNA-IPT; EC 2.5.1.8). In Arabidopsis, AtIPT2 encodes a tRNA-IPT (14Golovko A. Sitbon F. Tillberg E. Nicander B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 161-169Google Scholar). AtIPT9 is also similar to bacterial tRNA-IPT in sequence (8Kakimoto T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 677-685Google Scholar), though its enzyme activity has not been demonstrated. In plants, cZ and iP are generally the major components of prenylated tRNAs (13Murai N. Mok D.W.S. Mok M.C. Cytokinins: Chemistry, Activity, and Function. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 87-99Google Scholar). Therefore, the prenylated tRNA has been considered as a possible source of cZ. In addition, the occurrence of zeatin cis-trans isomerase activity (15Bassil N.V. Mok D. Mok M.C. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 867-872Google Scholar) suggests that the tRNA-mediated pathway might also contribute to the synthesis of tZ-type CKs through cZ-type CKs. Plants have two possible biosynthesis pathways for the prenyl group of CKs, the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids and the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytosol (16Lichtenthaler H.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 47-65Google Scholar, 17Rohmer M. Pure Appl. Chem. 2003; 75: 375-387Google Scholar). Both pathways supply the common isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and DMAPP. Although the MEP and MVA pathways exist in separate subcellular locations, there is some exchange of common precursor(s) between the two pathways (18Rohmer M. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1999; 16: 565-574Google Scholar, 19Kasahara H. Hanada A. Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45188-45194Google Scholar). Therefore, administration of a MEP pathway precursor can partially suppress the growth inhibition caused by a block in the MVA pathway and vice versa (20Hemmerlin A. Hoeffler J.F. Meyer O. Tritsch D. Kagan I.A. Grosdemange-Billiard C. Rohmer M. Bach T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26666-26676Google Scholar). As is the case with other isoprenoid biosyntheses, the MVA pathway had been considered the sole route for providing DMAPP to CKs until the MEP pathway was uncovered recently. In fact, the incorporation of 14C labeled MVA into the iP element of tRNA in vivo has been demonstrated in tobacco pith tissue (21Chen C.-M. Hall R.H. Phytochemistry. 1969; 8: 1687-1696Google Scholar). The incorporation of [13C]MVA into iP and trans-zeatin riboside (tZR) in vitro was also reported in the endosperm of Sechium edule seeds (22Piaggesi A. Picciarelli P. Ceccarelli N. Lorenzi R. Plant Sci. (Limerick). 1997; 129: 131-140Google Scholar). In addition, there are some reports that indicate that CK levels are reduced in plants when the MVA pathway is limited (23Laureys F. Dewitte W. Witters E. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Van Onckelen H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 29-32Google Scholar, 24Åstot C. Dolezal K. Nordström A. Wang Q. Kunkel T. Moritz T. Chua N.-H. Sandberg G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14778-14783Google Scholar, 25Crowell D.N. Salaz M.S. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 2090-2095Google Scholar). On the other hand, the contribution of the MEP pathway to CK biosynthesis has never been studied previously. It should be noted that the incorporation of MVA does not exclude a potential role of the MEP pathway in the biosynthesis of CKs; it has been observed that isoprene units from both MEP and MVA pathways are incorporated into a single downstream isoprenoid (19Kasahara H. Hanada A. Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45188-45194Google Scholar, 20Hemmerlin A. Hoeffler J.F. Meyer O. Tritsch D. Kagan I.A. Grosdemange-Billiard C. Rohmer M. Bach T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26666-26676Google Scholar). To selectively label metabolites from the MEP and MVA pathways with 13C in vivo, we have previously performed feeding of 13C labeled 1-deoxy-d-xylulose (DX) or mevalonolactone (MVL) to Arabidopsis seedlings (19Kasahara H. Hanada A. Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45188-45194Google Scholar). DX is converted into the MEP pathway intermediate 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate by phosphorylation. Therefore, exogenous DX is able to complement the albino phenotype of the cla1-1 mutant (26Estévez J.M. Cantero A. Romero C. Kawaide H. Jiménez L.F. Kuzuyama T. Seto H. Kamiya Y. Lelón P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 95-104Google Scholar), which is defective in 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase in the MEP pathway. Similarly, the growth inhibition due to a block in the MVA pathway by mevastatin (an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) is rescued by exogenous application of MVL (19Kasahara H. Hanada A. Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45188-45194Google Scholar). Efficient 13C labeling of metabolites from the MEP and MVA pathways was thus achieved by feeding 13C labeled DX and MVL to the cla1-1 mutant and mevastatin-treated plants, respectively, at a concentration that is sufficient to restore the phenotype nearly fully to wild type. This method allowed us to determine the contribution of the MEP and MVA pathways to the biosynthesis of gibberellins, another group of phytohormones, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (19Kasahara H. Hanada A. Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45188-45194Google Scholar). In this study, we address the biosynthesis route for the prenyl moiety of CKs using the 13C labeled tracers in Arabidopsis seedlings. Our data demonstrate that the prenyl side chains of tZ- and iP-type CKs are mainly produced through the MEP pathway, whereas a large fraction of cZ derivatives is synthesized through the MVA pathway. We also show the subcellular location of AtIPTs produced as green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusion proteins. Based on these data, we propose a crucial role of the plastid-localized MEP pathway in CK biosynthesis, and discuss how different classes of CKs are biosynthesized through the MEP and MVA pathways in plants. Plant Materials, Growth Conditions, and Chemicals—Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Wassilewskija-2 was used for 13C labeling experiments. Feeding of [1-13C]DX and [2-13C]MVL was carried out in the presence of 1% sucrose as described previously (19Kasahara H. Hanada A. Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45188-45194Google Scholar), except that uniconazole treatment was omitted. A. thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 was used for observation of GFP fluorescence. DX and [1-13C]DX (99% labeled) were synthesized as reported before using iodomethane and [13C]-iodomethane (99% labeled, Aldrich), respectively (27Giner J.-L. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 2479-2482Google Scholar). MVL (dl-mevalonolactone) and [2-13C]MVL (99% labeled) were purchased from Aldrich, and mevastatin was purchased from Calbiochem. Particle Bombardment—Full-length or part of the coding regions of AtIPTs (AtIPT1, Met1–Leu71; AtIPT2, Met1–Asn466; AtIPT3, Met1–Ser55; AtIPT4, Met1–Asn318; AtIPT5, Met1–Ser47; AtIPT7, Met1–Phe29; AtIPT8, Met1–Val330) were fused to the amino terminus of the GFP gene, which was controlled by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter (35S-sGFP (S65T)) (28Niwa Y. Hirano T. Yoshimoto K. Shimizu M. Kobayashi H. Plant J. 1999; 18: 455-463Google Scholar). The DNA constructs were introduced into the roots or rosette leaves of 2- or 3-week-old seedlings by particle bombardment (PDU-1000/He, Bio-Rad). Transient expression was observed by laser confocal-scanning fluorescence microscopy after overnight incubation (Fluoview IX5, Olympus). Stable Transformants of Arabidopsis—Genomic DNA fragments of AtIPT3 and AtIPT7 containing the 5′-flanking regions (3.9 kb for AtIPT3, 4.1 kb for AtIPT7) and the full coding regions were ligated into pTH2 vectors (29Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Google Scholar) to produce chimeric genes fused to the amino terminus of the GFP gene. The chimeric genes were introduced into Arabidopsis by the floral dip method (30Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Google Scholar). More than five independent lines were obtained, and T3 plants were used for analysis. Plant Hormone Analysis—Extraction and fractionation of CKs from Arabidopsis seedlings (3–4 g) were performed as described previously (31Dobrev P.I. Kaminek M. J. Chromatogr. A. 2002; 950: 21-29Google Scholar). The nucleotide CK fractions were further analyzed as the corresponding nucleosides after treatment with phosphatase (9Takei K. Yamaya T. Sakakibara H. J. Plant Res. 2003; 116: 265-269Google Scholar). Each CK fraction was purified by immunoaffinity columns (32Nicander B. Ståhl U. Björkman P.-O. Tillberg E. Planta. 1993; 189: 312-320Google Scholar) except for the addition of anti-cis-zeatin riboside (cZR) antibodies to the original protocol. After desalting, the resulting samples were dissolved in H2O and analyzed with a liquid chromatography (LC)-MS system (model 2695/ZQ2000MS, Waters). CKs were separated at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, with the gradients of solvents A (H2O), B (methanol), and C (0.1% acetic acid) set according to the following profile: 0 min, 95% A + 5% C; 1 min, 95% A + 5% C; 16 min, 45% A + 50% B + 5% C; 22 min, 25% A + 70% B + 5% C. Capillary voltage was 4.0 kV. Other conditions were described previously (9Takei K. Yamaya T. Sakakibara H. J. Plant Res. 2003; 116: 265-269Google Scholar). The quantification of [M+H]+ and +1 signals were achieved at levels between 0.1 and 100 pmol/injection using a standard curve. Abscisic acid (ABA) was purified from the methanoleluted fraction from the MCX column (Waters) in CK purification by high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by GC-MS as reported previously (33Cheng W.H. Endo A. Zhou L. Penney J. Chen H.C. Arroyo A. Leon P. Nambara E. Asami T. Seo M. Koshiba T. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2723-2743Google Scholar). The 13C incorporation level was calculated using the fragment ion cluster between m/z 190 and 192 after subtraction of natural 13C abundance (34Rauschenbach P. Schmidt H.L. Simon H. Tykva R. Wenzel M. Messung von Radioaktiven und Stabilen Isotopen. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1974: 360-366Google Scholar). Campesterol (CAM) was eluted from the MCX column with CH2Cl2 (3 ml x 3), after purification of CKs. CAM was further purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed by GC-MS as reported previously (19Kasahara H. Hanada A. Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45188-45194Google Scholar). CK Levels in Arabidopsis Seedlings—To study the metabolic origins of the prenyl group of CKs, we planned to conduct the 13C labeling experiment that was employed previously to determine the contribution of the MEP and MVA pathways to gibberellin biosynthesis (19Kasahara H. Hanada A. Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45188-45194Google Scholar). To examine whether this method was feasible for CKs, we first analyzed endogenous CK levels by LC-MS in Arabidopsis seedlings under the same growth conditions, after a feeding of non-labeled DX and MVL. When DX was fed to the cla1-1 mutant to rescue its albino phenotype, all CKs analyzed were detectable by LC-MS. As shown in Table I, the trend in the amount of individual CKs is as follows: nucleotide CKs > nucleoside CK > free-base CKs (e.g. trans-zeatin riboside monophosphate (tZRMP) > tZR > tZ). It was also noted that cZ-type CKs accumulated at much lower levels relative to tZ- and iP-type CKs. Similar accumulation patterns of different CK species were observed when the growth inhibition by mevastatin was rescued by MVL (Table I). These data allowed us to confirm that for all CKs examined, an accurate quantification of the molecular ion and its +1 isotopomer ion by LC-MS would be possible in this system with the exception of cZ, which was detectable, but its +1 isotopomer ion was below the range of reliable quantification.Table ICK levels in DX-fed cla1-1 seedlings and in MVL-fed wild type seedlings in the presence of 10 μm mevastatinCK levelstZRMPtZRtZiPRMPiPRiPcZRMPcZRcZpmol g-1 fresh weightDXaDX (0.8 mm) and MVL (3 mm) were fed for 15 days in Murashige-Skoog liquid media21.819.540.0420.790.430.110.860.22<0.01MVLaDX (0.8 mm) and MVL (3 mm) were fed for 15 days in Murashige-Skoog liquid media15.803.370.0915.730.330.100.890.26<0.01a DX (0.8 mm) and MVL (3 mm) were fed for 15 days in Murashige-Skoog liquid media Open table in a new tab Incorporation of [1-13C]DX and [2-13C]MVL into CKs—To evaluate the role of the MEP pathway in providing DMAPP to CKs, [1-13C]DX was fed to seedlings of the cla1-1 mutant. Likewise, to label metabolites from the MVA pathway [2-13C]MVL was fed to wild type seedlings in the presence of mevastatin. In both systems, one 13C atom would be incorporated into CKs if they were produced through the MEP or MVA pathways (Fig. 1). Table II shows the levels of 13C incorporation into CKs determined by LC-MS. The incorporation of [1-13C]DX was evident for all CKs listed in the table. For example, tZR has a molecular ion at m/z = 352, whereas the corresponding ion for tZR from the [1-13C]DX-treated cla1-1 seedlings was observed at m/z = 353. A fragment ion of tZR was detected from the [1-13C]DX-treated cla1-1 seedlings at m/z = 221, which is 1 mass unit larger than that of authentic tZR (m/z = 220). The presence of a 13C atom in cis-zeatin riboside monophosphate (cZRMP) and cZR was clear in the mevastatin-treated plants fed with [2-13C]MVL (Table II). Incorporation of [2-13C]MVL into cZ was also indicated by an ion at m/z = 221 ([M+H+1]+), which appeared more abundant than [M+H]+ of authentic cZ at m/z = 220 (data not shown), but their relative intensities could not be quantified because of low levels of cZ in the samples (Table I).Table IILC-MS data for CKsMass spectrum (% relative intensity)aThe relative intensity represents mean value from three independent experiments, and the intensity of base ion peak was set at 100%CKsSampleMolecular ionFragment ion[M+H]++1+2[M+H-RbR represents a ribosyl group]++1+2tZRMPcNucleotide CKs were analyzed by LC-MS as the corresponding nucleoside forms (as tZR)standard352 (100)353 (19)354 (3)220 (54)221 (7)222 (0)[1-13C]DXd[1-13C]DX (0.8 mm) was fed to the cla1-1 seedlings for 15 days352 (3)353 (100)354 (18)220 (2)221 (59)222 (7)[2-13C]MVLe[2-13C]MVL (3 mm) was fed to the wild type seedlings in the presence of 10 μm mevastatin for 15 days352 (100)353 (35)354 (5)220 (56)221 (15)222 (2)tZRstandard352 (100)353 (19)354 (3)220 (54)221 (7)222 (0)[1-13C]DX352 (3)353 (100)354 (18)220 (1)221 (57)222 (7)[2-13C]MVL352 (100)353 (36)354 (6)220 (56)221 (16)222 (2)tZstandard220 (100)221 (14)[1-13C]DX220 (8)221 (100)[2-13C]MVL220 (100)221 (32)iPRMPcNucleotide CKs were analyzed by LC-MS as the corresponding nucleoside forms (as iPR)standard336 (100)337 (18)338 (2)204 (86)205 (11)206 (1)[1-13C]DX336 (8)337 (100)338 (18)204 (7)205 (89)206 (11)[2-13C]MVL336 (100)337 (37)338 (6)204 (93)205 (27)206 (2)iPRstandard336 (100)337 (18)338 (2)204 (86)205 (11)206 (1)[1-13C]DX336 (7)337 (100)338 (18)204 (8)205 (92)206 (11)[2-13C]MVL336 (100)337 (27)338 (4)204 (90)205 (24)206 (3)iPstandard204 (100)205 (10)[1-13C]DX204 (27)205 (100)[2-13C]MVL204 (100)205 (19)cZRMPcNucleotide CKs were analyzed by LC-MS as the corresponding nucleoside forms (as cZR)standard352 (37)353 (7)354 (1)220 (100)221 (15)222 (0)[1-13C]DX352 (23)353 (38)354 (6)220 (67)221 (100)222 (13)[2-13C]MVL352 (13)353 (37)354 (5)220 (38)221 (100)222 (12)cZRstandard352 (37)353 (7)354 (1)220 (100)221 (15)222 (0)[1-13C]DX352 (19)353 (35)354 (6)220 (56)221 (100)222 (13)[2-13C]MVL352 (9)353 (36)354 (6)220 (34)221 (100)222 (12)a The relative intensity represents mean value from three independent experiments, and the intensity of base ion peak was set at 100%b R represents a ribosyl groupc Nucleotide CKs were analyzed by LC-MS as the corresponding nucleoside formsd [1-13C]DX (0.8 mm) was fed to the cla1-1 seedlings for 15 dayse [2-13C]MVL (3 mm) was fed to the wild type seedlings in the presence of 10 μm mevastatin for 15 days Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 shows relative levels of 13C incorporation from [1-13C]DX and [2-13C]MVL into CKs, ABA, and CAM determined from the data sets given in Table II after the subtraction of natural 13C abundance (34Rauschenbach P. Schmidt H.L. Simon H. Tykva R. Wenzel M. Messung von Radioaktiven und Stabilen Isotopen. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1974: 360-366Google Scholar). It has been reported previously (35Hirai N. Yoshida R. Todoroki Y. Ohigashi H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1448-1458Google Scholar) that the MEP pathway mainly supplies precursors to the biosynthesis of ABA, which is produced through carotenoids in plastids. By contrast, CAM is a cytosolic phytosterol that is primarily synthesized via the MVA pathway. Our data show that CKs can be classified into two groups based on the 13C labeling ratio from [1-13C]DX and [2-13C]MVL. tZ- and iP-type CKs was labeled at a high rate by [1-13C]DX but only at a low rate by [2-13C]MVL (Fig. 2). In marked contrast, about 75% of the prenyl moiety of cZ-type CKs (cZRMP and cZR) were labeled with [2-13C]MVL, whereas the incorporation of [1-13C]DX into cZ derivatives was significantly lower than the incorporation into tZ and iP derivatives. As discussed previously (19Kasahara H. Hanada A. Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45188-45194Google Scholar), the levels of 13C incorporation determined across separate feeding systems must be carefully interpreted, because the ratio of 13C labels in products can be altered by the concentration of 13C precursors in the media. Thus, the values in Fig. 2 do not immediately reflect the relative contribution of each isoprenoid pathway under normal growth conditions. Nevertheless, we conclude from the LC-MS data that tZ- and iP-type CKs in Arabidopsis seedlings are predominantly synthesized via the MEP pathway because of the following observations. First, the incorporation of [2-13C]MVL into tZ and iP derivatives was consistently low (<20%), whereas nearly 90% of the isoprene units of CAM were labeled with 13C in the same sample (Fig. 2 and Table II). This observation indicates that the MVA pathway is not the primary route used to provide DMAPP to tZ- and iP-type CKs. Second, the level of 13C incorporation into tZ and iP derivatives from [1-13C]DX was as high as that into ABA, which is known to be biosynthesized mainly through the MEP pathway (35Hirai N. Yoshida R. Todoroki Y. Ohigashi H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1448-1458Google Scholar). On the other hand, we predict that the MVA pathway provides a greater proportion of DMAPP to the biosynthesis of cZ-type CKs in comparison to that of tZ- and iP-type CKs, because [2-13C]MVL was introduced into these CKs nearly as efficiently as it was into CAM in the same feeding experiment. This idea is also supported by the significantly lower levels of 13C incorporation into cZ-type CKs from [1-13C]DX than that into ABA. Subcellular Localization of AtIPTs—Because the prenyl group of tZ- and iP-type CKs is predominantly synthesized through the MEP pathway (Fig. 2), we speculated that some IPTs should use the DMAPP produced in plastids. Compared with the bacterial enzyme tmr, all AtIPTs except for AtIPT4 have an amino-terminal extension consisting of 30–60 amino acids (7Takei K. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26405-26410Google Scholar). The ChloroP 1.1 program (36Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Google Scholar) predicted that the amino-terminal regions of AtIPT1, -3, -5, and -8 might function to localize these AtIPTs to plastids. To obtain experimental evidence for the subcellular locations of IPT activities, we prepared DNA constructs designed to produce translational fusions of individual AtIPTs and GFP. Because some of the fusion proteins containing the full coding regions of AtIPTs tended to precipitate in cells (data not shown), the amino-terminal regions, which could function as transit peptides, were fused to GFP (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). The plasmid DNAs were introduced into both Arabidopsis leaf and root cells, and the transient expression of the chimeric genes was observed. The fluorescence of AtIPT1-, AtIPT3-, and AtIPT5-GFP in mesophyll cells was observed in plastids as the signal overlapped with autofluorescence derived from chlorophylls (Fig. 3, A, B, D, and G). AtIPT8-GFP exhibited the same fluorescence pattern as AtIPT1 and -3 in root cells (Fig. 3, C, E, and H). However, the fluorescence of AtIPT4- and AtIPT2-GFP was distributed in the cytosol (Fig. 3, I, M, and N). It should be noted that an identical pattern of GFP fluorescence was observed when the GFP was fused to the carboxyl terminus of AtIPT4 (data not shown). The fluorescence of AtIPT7-GFP was observed in the mitochondria (Fig. 3, J and K). To avoid mislocation of the fusion proteins because of transient expression by a strong promoter, we next generated stable transformants of Arabidopsis expressing AtIPT3- and AtIPT7-GFP controlled by their native promoters. Consequently, the pattern of fluorescence produced by both of these constructs was essentially the same as the respective transiently expressed fusion proteins (Fig. 3, compare E with F and K with L). These results strongly suggest that four adenosine phosphate-IPTs, AtIPT1, -3, -5, and -8, localize in plastids in agreement with the idea that the MEP pathway primarily provides DMAPP for tZ and iP synthesis. As for tRNA-IPT, AtIPT2-GFP localized in the cytosol (Fig. 3, M and N). We did not examine the location of AtIPT6 and -9, because AtIPT6 does not appear to encode a functional IPT in some Arabidopsis ecotypes owing to a point mutation (8Kakimoto T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 677-685Google Scholar) and because the enzyme activity of AtIPT9 could not be detected (data not shown). Using a 13C labeled precursor specific to the MEP and MVA pathways, we have demonstrated that both isoprenoid pathways can supply DMAPP to CKs in Arabidopsis seedlings (Fig. 2). In addition, subcellular localization of AtIPT-GFP fusion proteins has been determined in Arabidopsis cells. The results from GFP fluorescence observations suggest that IPT isozymes are distributed to multiple subcellular compartments (Fig. 4). These data now provide new insights into CK biosynthesis as discussed below. The Origin of DMAPP for tZ- and iP-type CKs—The localization of several adenosine phosphate-IPTs to plastids (Fig. 3) is consistent with the role of the MEP pathway in providing DMAPP to tZ- and iP-type CKs (Fig. 2). The dominant role of the MEP pathway in the biosynthesis of iP-type CKs is in agreement with the recent finding that overexpression of the AtIPT8/PGA22 gene, the product of which was found in plastids when expressed as a GFP fusion protein (Fig. 3), drastically increased the level of iPRMP and iPR in Arabidopsis (37Sun J. Niu Q.W. Tarkowski P. Zheng B. Tarkowska D. Sandberg G. Chua N.H. Zuo J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 167-176Google Scholar). There are at least two possible explanations for the minor incorporation of [2-13C]MVL into tZ- and iP-type CKs (Fig. 2). First, as has been suggested previously, there may be some exchange of common isoprenoid precursors (e.g. isopentenyl diphosphate or DMAPP) between the cytosol and plastids. This mechanism has been proposed to explain the minor incorporation of [2-13C]MVL into ent-kaurene (a precursor for gibberellins), assuming that ent-kaurene synthesis occurs exclusively in plastids as supported by the subcellular localization of enzymes (38Helliwell C.A. Sullivan J.A. Mould R.M. Gray J.C. Peacock W.J. Dennis E.S. Plant J. 2001; 28: 201-208Google Scholar). However, in the case of the biosynthesis of tZ- and iP-type CKs, a small amount of 13C label from [2-13C]MVL can also be attributed to the function of another adenosine phosphate-IPT, AtIPT4, which is presumably present in the cytosol (Fig. 3I). In addition, the localization of AtIPT7-GFP in the mitochondria (Fig. 3, J–L) suggests that this enzyme may also use DMAPP from the MVA pathway, because ubiquinones, a group of isoprenoids in mitochondria, are synthesized principally through the MVA pathway (39Disch A. Hemmerlin A. Bach T.J. Rohmer M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 615-621Google Scholar). Therefore, a major role of the MEP pathway in the biosynthesis of tZ- and iP-type CK in Arabidopsis seedlings under the current growth conditions does not rule out a greater contribution of the MVA pathway to these CKs under different growth conditions, if the relative abundance of IPT isozymes is modulated. Thus, our present results do not contradict previous reports (22Piaggesi A. Picciarelli P. Ceccarelli N. Lorenzi R. Plant Sci. (Limerick). 1997; 129: 131-140Google Scholar, 23Laureys F. Dewitte W. Witters E. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Van Onckelen H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 29-32Google Scholar, 24Åstot C. Dolezal K. Nordström A. Wang Q. Kunkel T. Moritz T. Chua N.-H. Sandberg G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14778-14783Google Scholar) indicating a role for the MVA pathway in providing DMAPP for tZ-type CKs. In this context, to fully understand the relative roles of the MEP and MVA pathways in CK biosynthesis, it will be informative to determine how individual AtIPT genes are regulated during plant development and under different environmental conditions. Recently, Åstot et al. (24Åstot C. Dolezal K. Nordström A. Wang Q. Kunkel T. Moritz T. Chua N.-H. Sandberg G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14778-14783Google Scholar) measured the biosynthetic rates of tZRMP and iPRMP using in vivo isotope labeling and proposed an iPRMP-independent pathway for the biosynthesis of tZ-type CKs. In this model, a hydroxylated derivative of DMAPP is directly transferred to AMP (24Åstot C. Dolezal K. Nordström A. Wang Q. Kunkel T. Moritz T. Chua N.-H. Sandberg G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14778-14783Google Scholar). In light of this finding, our result showing the involvement of the MEP pathway in tZ biosynthesis is intriguing because hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate, the best hypothetical substrate in the iPRMP-independent pathway (24Åstot C. Dolezal K. Nordström A. Wang Q. Kunkel T. Moritz T. Chua N.-H. Sandberg G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14778-14783Google Scholar), has been known as an intermediate of the MEP pathway (Fig. 4) (40Hecht S. Eisenreich W. Adam P. Amslinger S. Kis K. Bacher A. Arigoni D. Rohdich F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14837-14842Google Scholar). In fact, it has been demonstrated recently (41Krall L. Raschke M. Zenk M.H. Baron C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 315-318Google Scholar) that TZS, an IPT from Agrobacterium, is capable of synthesizing tZRMP from hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate and AMP in vitro. To examine whether the iPRMP-independent pathway operates in plants, hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate should be tested as a substrate for AtIPT1, -3, -5, and -8 in vitro. The Origin of DMAPP for cZ-type CKs—Based on the efficient 13C incorporation of [2-13C]MVL into cZ derivatives, relative to that into ABA and other CKs (Fig. 2), we postulate that a large portion of the prenyl group of cZ-type CKs originates from the MVA pathway. However, the level of [1-13C]DX incorporation into cZ-type CKs was also significantly higher than incorporation into CAM, a cytosolic sterol that is mainly produced through the MVA pathway. Therefore, the MEP pathway appears to supply DMAPP to cZ derivatives at a level beyond the hypothesized exchange of isoprenoid precursors (Fig. 4). Unlike the possible participation of a P450 monooxygenase in the hydroxylation of iP to form tZ (12Chen C.-M. Leisner S.M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 442-446Google Scholar), the conversion of iP-type CKs into their corresponding cZ derivatives has not been reported. Therefore, this route cannot readily be hypothesized at the moment. A probable explanation for the incorporation of MEP-derived DMAPP into cZ derivatives is isomerization of tZ-type CKs (Fig. 4). The presence of a cis-trans isomerase of zeatin has been reported in cell-free extracts from immature seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris (15Bassil N.V. Mok D. Mok M.C. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 867-872Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the isomerization of zeatin in both directions in favor of cZ to tZ and uses cZR and tZR as substrates as well. In our experimental conditions, the amounts of cZ-type CKs were much smaller than those of corresponding tZ-type CKs (Table I), and the majority of tZ- type CKs were labeled with 13C in cla1-1 seedlings fed with [1-13C]DX (Fig. 2). Thus, even a small proportion of isomerization of tZ to cZ would account for the increase in 13C incorporation from [1-13C]DX into cZ-type CKs. In contrast, the rate of 13C incorporation into tZ-type CKs from [1-13C]DX would not be greatly affected by isomerization of cZ-type CKs because of their low levels in the current experimental system. A role of the tRNA-dependent pathway has been proposed in the biosynthesis of cZ-type CKs, because the N6-prenylated adenine element of tRNA generally consists of iP- and cZ-type CKs but not tZ-type CKs (13Murai N. Mok D.W.S. Mok M.C. Cytokinins: Chemistry, Activity, and Function. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 87-99Google Scholar). In addition, no hydroxylase activity has ever been shown to produce cZ derivatives from iP-type CKs. Our finding that the AtIPT2-GFP fusion protein localizes to the cytosol (Fig. 3) suggests that the N6-prenylation of tRNA takes place in this subcellular compartment in Arabidopsis and implies the use of DMAPP derived from the MVA pathway. In fact, our 13C labeling experiments indicated that a large proportion of cZ derivatives are synthesized through the MVA pathway (Fig. 2), supporting the role of N6-prenylated tRNA in the biosynthesis of cZ-type CKs (Fig. 4). The incorporation of 14C labeled MVA into the iP element of tRNA has been demonstrated previously in tobacco pith tissue (21Chen C.-M. Hall R.H. Phytochemistry. 1969; 8: 1687-1696Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated a critical contribution of the plastid-located MEP pathway in providing the prenyl precursor to tZ- and iP-type CKs in Arabidopsis seedlings. This conclusion is well supported by the localization of multiple AtIPT-GFP fusion proteins in plastids. In contrast, it is likely that the MVA pathway is mainly responsible for the biosynthesis of cZ derivatives, although our data do not exclude the possibility that a small fraction of cZ derivatives may be produced through isomerization of tZ-type CKs. It is still not clear whether cZ plays any critical role in plant development; however, the distinct origins of large fractions of DMAPP for tZ and cZ biosynthesis suggest that plants are able to separately modulate the level of these CK species. Further characterization of the biosynthesis pathway for cZ would be necessary to evaluate its physiological significance in plants. Additional work is required to uncover how multiple IPTs in varying subcellular compartments control the levels of different classes of CKs during plant development and in response to environmental cues.

Pancreatic trypsin may be a physiologically relevant agonist of PAR2 and PAR4 in the lumen of the small intestine, since trypsin can signal to enterocytes by cleaving PAR2 at the apical membrane (16Kong W. McConalogue K. Khitin L.M. Hollenberg M.D. Payan D.G. Bohm S.K. Bunnett N.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8884-8889Google Scholar), and in the inflamed pancreas, when there is premature activation of trypsinogen, which can signal to acinar or ductal cells (10Bohm S.K. Kong W. Bromme D. Smeekens S.P. Anderson D.C. Connolly A. Kahn M. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 1009-1016Google Scholar, 17Nguyen T.D. Moody M.W. Steinhoff M. Okolo C. Koh D.S. Bunnett N.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 261-269Google Scholar). However, given the widespread distribution of PAR2 and PAR4, it is unlikely that pancreatic trypsin is a physiologically relevant agonist in tissues other than the small intestine and pancreas. Trypsinogens I, II, and mesotrypsinogen are the major trypsinogen genes in the human pancreas (18Emi M. Nakamura Y. Ogawa M. Yamamoto T. Nishide T. Mori T. Matsubara K. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 41: 305-310Google Scholar, 19Nyaruhucha C.N. Kito M. Fukuoka S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10573-10578Google Scholar). These genes encode proteins with a signal sequence, an activation peptide and a catalytic domain. Enteropeptidase cleaves (↓) at the DDDDK↓I site of the zymogens to release active trypsins (20Kunitz M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1939; 22: 429-446Google Scholar, 21Yamashina I. Acta Chem. Scand. 1956; 10: 739-743Google Scholar), which are highly homologous and share critical active site residues. Trypsinogens I and II are the principal forms of trypsin that are secreted in pancreatic juice, activated by enteropeptidase in the small intestine and participate in digestion. Mesotrypsinogen is a minor trypsinogen in human pancreatic juice (22Rinderknecht H. Renner I.G. Abramson S.B. Carmack C. Gastroenterology. 1984; 86: 681-692Google Scholar). However, mesotrypsinogen is uniquely susceptible to activation by lysosomal cathepsin B and may thus be prematurely activated in the inflamed pancreas (23Szmola R. Kukor Z. Sahin-Toth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48580-48589Google Scholar). Moreover, mesotrypsin is unaffected by polypeptide trypsin inhibitors such as soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) and human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (hPSTI) (19Nyaruhucha C.N. Kito M. Fukuoka S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10573-10578Google Scholar) and efficiently degrades and thus inactivates these inhibitors (23Szmola R. Kukor Z. Sahin-Toth M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48580-48589Google Scholar). Trypsinogen IV was originally identified in human brain and may be a splice variant of mesotrypsinogen (24Wiegand U. Corbach S. Minn A. Kang J. Muller-Hill B. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 167-175Google Scholar). Trypsinogen IV differs from mesotrypsinogen in exon 1 in that it lacks a recognizable signal sequence. However, trypsinogen IV contains three potential furin-processing sites (Arg-X-X-Arg↓) and may be a secreted enzyme. Brain trypsinogen IV has been proposed to control expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and to process the amyloid precursor protein, but its physiological function is unknown (25Minn A. Schubert M. Neiss W.F. Muller-Hill B. Glia. 1998; 22: 338-347Google Scholar). Trypsinogens have also been identified in extrapancreatic tissues including endothelial cells, tumor cell lines and tissues, and neurons (26Koivunen E. Huhtala M.-L. Stenman U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14095-14099Google Scholar, 27Koivunen E. Saksela O. Itkonen O. Osman S. Huhtala M.-L. Stenman U.-H. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 47: 592-596Google Scholar, 28Koshikawa N. Yasumitsu H.

Pathol. 1998; 153: 937-944Google Scholar). However, the properties and functions of these extrapancreatic trypsinogens are not fully understood. We characterized trypsinogens expressed in human colonic mucosa and extrapancreatic epithelial cell lines and investigated whether they are agonists of PARs. Our aims were to: (a) determine if epithelial cell lines and tissues express trypsinogens, enteropeptidase, and PARs; (b) clone, express, and characterize the major trypsinogens in epithelial cells; (c) investigate whether extrapancreatic trypsins activate PARs. Reagents—Oligonucleotides were from Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Enteropeptidase and Tgo DNA polymerase were from Roche Applied Science. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal antibody to Myc was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to rat trypsin was a gift from Dr. Charles Craik (UCSF), and a mouse monoclonal antibody to human trypsin was from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase or FITC were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Bovine pancreatic trypsin was from Worthington Biochemical Corporation (Lakewood, NJ), human thrombin was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). A peptide corresponding to the tethered ligand domain of human PAR2 (SLIGKV-NH2) and analogues of the tethered ligand of human PAR1 (TFLLR-NH2) and PAR4 (AYPGKF-NH2) were from Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), α1-antitrypsin inhibitor, benzamidine, pepstatin A, and tosyl-glycine-proline-arginine-p-nitroanilide were from Sigma Chemical Co. E-64D and PPACK were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Leupeptin was from Roche Applied Science. Cell Lines—Tumor-derived human epithelial cell lines (PC-3, prostate; SW480, Caco2, colon; A549, airway; HPAC, pancreatic ductal) and CHO cells were obtained from American Tissue Type Collection. NCM460 cells are a non-transformed human colonic epithelial cell line (31Moyer M.P. Manzano L.A. Merriman R.L. Stauffer J.S. Tanzer L.R. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1996; 32: 315-317Google Scholar) and were maintained in Hams F12 with 20% fetal bovine serum containing hydrocorticosterone (0.4 μg/ml) and insulin (0.5 units/ml) (32Ferris H.A. Carroll R.E. Lorimer D.L. Benya R.V. Peptides. 1997; 18: 663-672Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in F12K medium (PC-3, A549), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (SW480, HPAC), MEM (Caco2) or Hams F12 (CHO) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (PC-3, A549, SW480, HPAC, CHO) or 20% fetal bovine serum (Caco2) in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Sarcoma virus-transformed rat kidney epithelial cells (KNRK) stably expressing human PAR1 (N-terminal FLAG), human PAR2 (N-terminal FLAG, C-terminal HA.11), and rat PAR4 (N-terminal Myc) were generated as described (33Bohm S.K. Khitin L.M. Grady E.F. Aponte G. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22003-22016Google Scholar). RT-PCR—Total RNA from epithelial cell lines (PC-3, SW480, NCM460, Caco2, A549) (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT)15 and AMV-RT (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR reactions used primers to the C terminus of trypsinogens that would amplify all known gene products (forward: 5′-GCCAAGCTTCGCGTGTCCACCATCTGTGTCG-3′, reverse: 5′-CAGCGGCCGCTTAGCTGTTGGCAGCTATGGTG-3′); for PAR2 (forward: 5′-CCCTTTGTATGTCGTGAAGCAGAC-3′, reverse: 5′-TTCCTGGAGTGTTTCTTTGAGGTG-3′); and enteropeptidase (forward: 5′-CTTAGAGCCATCCAAGTGGAC-3′, reverse: 5′-CTAATGTAGAAAACTTTGTATCC-3′). Total RNA from normal human colonic mucosa (4 μg) was reverse transcribed and analyzed for presence of trypsinogen IV using primers to distinguish between trypsinogen IV and mesotrypsinogen: forward: 5′-GGGCCTGGAGCTGCACCCGCTTCTG-3′, reverse: 5′-CAGCCGGAGATGAGGCACTC-3′. Control reactions omitted reverse transcriptase. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis (2% agarose gel), visualized using ethidium bromide and completely sequenced. Cloning and Expression of Trypsinogen IV—Total RNA was isolated from PC-3 cells. Primers were designed based on the trypsinogen IV sequence (forward 5′-GGGCCTGGAGCTGCACCCGCTTCTG-3; reverse 5′-CAGCGGCCGCTTAGCTGTTGGCAGCTATGGTG-3′). The forward primer was designed to amplify trypsinogen IV but not mesotrypsinogen. The 5′ truncated clone obtained with these primers was completed by an additional PCR reaction using synthetic oligonucleotides (forward: 5′-ATGTGCGGACCTGACGACAGATGCCCCGCACGCTGGCCGGGACCGGGAAGGGCGGTCAAGTGTG-3′ plus 5′-GAAAGGGTCTGGCGGCTGCCAGGCCTGGCAGAGTGGAGCGGGGCGGGGCGCAGCGGGGCGGGGC-3′; reverse 5′-GCCCCGCCCCGCTGCGCCCCGCCCCGCTCCACTCTG-3′ plus 5′-CCAGGCCTGGCAGCCGCCAGACCCTTTCCACACTTGACCGCCCTTCC-3′). A C-terminal Myc epitope was added to the cDNA by PCR using the primer: 5′-TTACAGATCCTCTTCCGATATCAGTTTTTGTTCGCTATTGGCAGCTATGGTG-3′. An expression vector (pcDNA3.1(+); Invitrogen) containing a murine immunoglobulin κ-chain V-J2-C (Igκ) signal sequence was generated by introduction of a linker sequence using the primer pair: 5′-AATTCACCATGGAGACAGACACACTCCTGCTATGGGTACTGCTGCTCTGGGTTCCAGGTTCCACTGGTGACGAT-3′; 5′-ATCGTCACCAGTGGAACCTGGAACCCAGAGCAGCAGTACCCATAGCAGGAGTGTGTCTGTCTCCATGGTG-3′. Trypsinogen IV with C-terminal Myc or N-terminal Igκ was transiently expressed in CHO cells using LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen) to generate CHO-TIV-myc cells and CHO-Igκ-TIV cells, respectively. In control experiments, CHO cells were transfected with vector without the trypsinogen IV insert (CHO-vc cells). Cell lysates were prepared by scraping cells into 50 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.8 followed by sonication and clearing of the lysate by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 10 min). Conditioned medium was obtained by culturing cells in reduced-serum medium (OptiMEM, Invitrogen) for 24 h post-transfection. The conditioned medium was cleared by centrifugation and concentrated using spin concentrators (10 kDa exclusion, Vivascience Inc., Edgewood, NY). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay, with BSA as standard (34Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Cell lysates or conditioned medium were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide gels). Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature (1× PBS, 2% BSA, 5% milk powder, 0.1% Tween 20). Blots were incubated with antibodies to Myc (1:5,000) or rat trypsin (1:5,000) overnight at 4 °C (1× PBS, 2% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20). Membranes were washed for 30 min (1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) and were incubated with secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000, 1 h, room temperature). Membranes were washed for 30 min and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). Localization of Trypsinogen—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm PBS, pH 7.4, for 20 min at 4 °C, washed and incubated in PBS containing 0.1% saponin and 1% goat serum for 15 min. Cells were incubated with antibodies to Myc, human, or rat trypsin (1:250–1,000 overnight, 4 °C), washed, and incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to FITC (1:200, 2 h, room temperature). Specimens were observed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) with an MRC 1000 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Measurement of Ca2+ Mobilization—Cells were incubated in HBSS, 0.1% BSA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 25 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were mounted in an open chamber (Warner Instruments Corporation, Hamden, CT, 37 °C) on a Zeiss 100 TV inverted microscope, and observed with a Zeiss Fluar 40× objective. Fluorescence was measured at 340 and 380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission in individual cells, using an ICCD video camera (Stanford Photonics, Stanford, CA) and a video microscopy acquisition program (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA). The emission ratio of the fluorescence at the two excitation wavelengths, which is proportional to the [Ca2+]i, was calculated. Agonists were directly added to the chamber (50 μl each injection). Enzymatic Assays—Conditioned medium (5 μg of total protein) or trypsin (12 ng) was incubated in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 20 mm CaCl2 containing 0.5 mm tosyl-glycine-proline-arginine-p-nitroanilide for 15 min at 37 °C. Activity was monitored by measuring absorbance at 405 nm using a Vmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). Inhibitors were preincubated on ice with conditioned medium for 30 min before addition of substrate. Expression of Trypsinogen, PAR2, and Enteropeptidase in Epithelial Cell Lines—We used RT-PCR to examine whether epithelial cell lines express trypsinogen, the trypsinogen activator enteropeptidase and the trypsin receptor PAR2. PC-3, SW480, Caco2, A549, and NCM460 cells all expressed mRNA of the sizes predicted for trypsinogen (400 bp) and PAR2 (525 bp), and all cell lines except for Caco2 and NCM460 also expressed mRNA for enteropeptidase (568 bp) (Fig. 1A for PC-3; others not shown). The identity of PAR2, trypsinogens, and enteropeptidase was confirmed by sequencing (2–8 sequencing reactions per gene per cell line). The primers for trypsinogen would amplify all known trypsinogen gene products. However, we only identified sequences corresponding to trypsinogen IV or mesotrypsinogen in all cell lines, except in NCM460 cells where we also found trypsinogen I. These primers amplified products with sequences for trypsinogen I and II from the pancreatic cell line HPAC (not shown) and were thus able to amplify the other forms of trypsinogen. We were unable to amplify full-length products using mesotrypsinogen-specific primers in any of the cell lines. However, primers specific to trypsinogen IV amplified a partial clone of trypsinogen IV. Thus, the extrapancreatic epithelial cell lines derived from several organs (prostate, colon, airway) express mRNA encoding trypsinogen IV and PAR2, and most also express enteropeptidase. Expression of Trypsinogens in Normal Human Colonic Mucosa—To confirm that trypsinogens are expressed in normal human colonic mucosa, total RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR. A PCR product of the predicted size (400 bp) was obtained using the primers for trypsinogens (not shown). Products were subcloned and their identity confirmed by sequencing (21 sequencing reactions, 2 patients). All products were found to be identical to either trypsinogen IV or mesotrypsinogen. Using primers to distinguish between trypsinogen IV and mesotrypsinogen, a 474-bp product was amplified and identified as trypsinogen IV by sequencing (9 sequencing reactions, 1 patient). Thus, normal human colonic mucosa, which is known to express PAR2 (10Bohm S.K. Kong W. Bromme D. Smeekens S.P. Anderson D.C. Connolly A. Kahn M. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 1009-1016Google Scholar), also expresses trypsinogen IV. Localization of Trypsinogen Immunoreactivity in Epithelial Cell Lines—To confirm expression of trypsinogen at the protein level, PC-3, and SW480 cells were stained using a monoclonal antibody to human trypsin. This antibody would be expected to cross-react with all forms of trypsin in view of their high degree of homology. Immunoreactive trypsin was detected in vesicles in the cytoplasm of PC-3 and SW480 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). The vesicles were densely localized in a perinuclear region in both cell types, but some were also detected in close proximity to the plasma membrane. The pattern of staining resembled that for trypsin in secretory granules of HPAC (not shown) and pancreatic acinar cells (Bunnett). 2N. W. Bunnett, unpublished data. Since PC-3 and SW480 cells only expressed trypsinogen IV mRNA, we deduce that this immunoreactivity represents trypsinogen IV protein. Expression of Functional PAR2 in Epithelial Cell Lines—To confirm that PC-3 and SW480 cells expressed functional PAR2, we measured Ca2+ mobilization to bovine pancreatic trypsin and the PAR2-selective agonist SLIGKV-NH2, which corresponds to the tethered ligand domain of human PAR2. Both trypsin and SLIGKV-NH2 stimulated a prompt increase in [Ca2+]i in both cell lines (Fig. 2, A and B). The responses were concentration-dependent, although trypsin was more potent than SLIGKV-NH2. The reverse sequence of the tethered ligand peptide, VKGILS-NH2, which does not activate PAR2, had no effect on [Ca2+]i. Thus, PC-3 and SW480 cells express functional PAR2. Trypsin (10 nm) and SLIGKV-NH2 (100 μm) also mobilized Ca2+ in NCM460 cells, confirming expression of PAR2 (not shown). However, we could not detect responses to the PAR4-selective agonist AYPGKF-NH2 in PC-3, SW480, or NCM460 cells (not shown), suggesting that these cells do not express functional PAR4. We have previously shown that PAR2 is expressed in A549 cells and Caco2 cells (10Bohm S.K. Kong W. Bromme D. Smeekens S.P. Anderson D.C. Connolly A. Kahn M. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 1009-1016Google Scholar). Cloning and Expression of Human Trypsinogen IV—We amplified a partial clone of trypsinogen IV from PC-3 cells using RT-PCR and completed the clone as described in the “Experimental Procedures.” Sequence analysis confirmed that the clone was identical to the reported sequence of human trypsinogen IV (a form) (24Wiegand U. Corbach S. Minn A. Kang J. Muller-Hill B. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 167-175Google Scholar). We expressed trypsinogen IV with C-terminal Myc in CHO cells. It was not possible to generate a viable cell line that stably expressed this construct. However, when transiently expressed the cells were viable. We investigated the presence of trypsinogen IV in whole cell lysates and conditioned medium by immunoblotting for Myc. In CHO-TIV-myc cells, we detected trypsinogen IV in the cell lysate, with an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa, but not in conditioned medium (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Exposure of cells to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate or forskolin (both 1 μm, 60 min) (not shown) did not stimulate detectable release of trypsinogen IV into the medium as assessed by Western blotting, indicating that activation of protein kinase C or cAMP does not stimulate secretion of trypsinogen IV. Immunoreactive proteins were not detected in lysate or medium from CHO-vc cells (expressing vector without trypsinogen IV insert). Analysis by immunofluorescence using the myc antibody detected trypsinogen IV in granules within the cytoplasm of CHO-TIV-myc cells (Fig. 3B), similar to that observed using the antibody to human trypsin in epithelial cell lines (Fig. 1, B and C). Immunoreactive trypsinogen IV was detected in densely packed vesicles throughout the cytosol and in close proximity to the nucleus and plasma membrane. Staining was not detected in CHO-vc cells (Fig. 3C), confirming the specificity. The trypsin antibody similarly stained CHO-TIV-myc cells (Fig. 3D) but not CHO-vc cells (Fig. 3E). Thus, trypsinogen IV is found in vesicles of transfected cells but we were unable to detect spontaneous secretion. Enzymatic Analysis of Expressed Trypsinogen IV—To obtain trypsinogen IV for enzymatic analysis, we engineered trypsinogen IV with a murine Igκ signal sequence at the N terminus, which leads to spontaneous secretion of the protein into the medium. Expression was assessed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting using antibodies to rat trypsin. Trypsinogen IV immunoreactivity was observed in granules in CHO-Igκ-TIV cells (Fig. 4A). Analysis of lysates of CHO-Igκ-TIV cells identified low levels of an immunoreactive protein with an apparent mass of 43.5 kDa (Fig. 4B, lane 3). We concentrated conditioned medium, and incubated the concentrate with enteropeptidase to activate the zymogen. Trypsinogen IV cleavage was assessed by immunoblotting. Trypsinogen IV was detected in the conditioned medium of CHO-Igκ-TIV cells as a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa (Fig. 4B, lane 4). This reduction in apparent mass is probably due to removal of the signal sequence. Treatment of the concentrate with enteropeptidase to activate the zymogen reduced the size of the secreted protein to 30 kDa, consistent with trypsinogen IV cleavage to trypsin IV (Fig. 4B, lane 5). There was no detectable trypsinogen IV in the medium or lysate from CHO-vc cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). We assessed the activation of trypsinogen IV using an enzymatic assay. There was no detectable trypsin activity in conditioned medium from CHO-Igκ-TIV or CHO-vc cells. Treatment of conditioned medium from CHO-Igκ-TIV cells with enteropeptidase generated tryptic activity (29 nmol/min/mg total protein). However, there was no detectable activity in enteropeptidase-treated medium collected from CHO-vc cells. We compared the effects of various inhibitors on the activity of bovine pancreatic trypsin and trypsin IV. Pepstatin A (inhibits aspartyl proteases) and E-64D (inhibits cysteinyl proteases) had little or no effect on either forms of trypsin (Fig. 5). Synthetic, low molecular mass inhibitors such as leupeptin, PPACK, and benzamidine abolished or strongly inhibited the activity of both trypsin IV and bovine trypsin. High molecular mass polypeptide inhibitors such as SBTI, BPTI and α1-antitrypsin inhibitor abolished the activity of the bovine trypsin, but had no effect on the activity of trypsin IV. Thus, trypsin IV is a serine protease that is resistant to polypeptide inhibitors when compared with other isoforms of trypsin. Trypsin IV Activates PAR2 and"
https://openalex.org/W1984655708,"c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is activated by diverse cell stimuli, including stress, growth factors, and cytokines. Traditionally, activation of JNK by stress treatment is thought to induce cell death. However, our recent data indicate that JNK's ability to sensitize cells to apoptosis may be, in part, cell cycle dependent. Here, we show that the majority of both paclitaxel- and UV-induced apoptosis can be inhibited by the pharmacological JNK inhibitor, SP600125, in MCF-7 cells. However, inhibition of JNK does little to reverse doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells or doxorubicin- and UV-mediated death in MDA MB-231 cells. SP treatment causes G2/M arrest of three breast cancer cell lines and results in the endoreduplication (cellular DNA content >4N) of MCF-7 and MDA MB-231 cells. These effects on cell cycle and apoptosis are not significantly altered by the inhibition of p53, indicating that JNK is functioning independently of p53. Lastly, inhibition of JNK using both SP and antisense oligonucleotides targeted to JNK1 and JNK2 reduced proliferation of all three breast cancer cell lines. Taken together, these results suggest that the activation of JNK is important for the induction of apoptosis following stresses that function at different cell cycle phases, and that basal JNK activity is necessary to promote proliferation and maintain diploidy in breast cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2062843046,"Xanthine dehydrogenase from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana was analyzed on molecular and biochemical levels. Whereas most other organisms appear to own only one gene for xanthine dehydrogenase A. thaliana possesses two genes in tandem orientation spaced by 704 base pairs. The cDNAs as well as the proteins AtXDH1 and AtXDH2 share an overall identity of 93% and show high homologies to xanthine dehydrogenases from other organisms. Whereas AtXDH2 mRNA is expressed constitutively, alterations of AtXDH1 transcript levels were observed at various stresses like drought, salinity, cold, and natural senescence, but also after abscisic acid treatment. Transcript alteration did not mandatorily result in changes of xanthine dehydrogenase activities. Whereas salt treatment had no effect on xanthine dehydrogenase activities, cold stress caused a decrease, but desiccation and senescence caused a strong increase of activities in leaves. Because AtXDH1 presumably is the more important isoenzyme in A. thaliana it was expressed in Pichia pastoris, purified, and used for biochemical studies. AtXDH1 protein is a homodimer of about 300 kDa consisting of identical subunits of 150 kDa. Like xanthine dehydrogenases from other organisms AtXDH1 uses hypoxanthine and xanthine as main substrates and is strongly inhibited by allopurinol. AtXDH1 could be activated by the purified molybdenum cofactor sulfurase ABA3 that converts inactive desulfo-into active sulfoenzymes. Finally it was found that AtXDH1 is a strict dehydrogenase and not an oxidase, but is able to produce superoxide radicals indicating that besides purine catabolism it might also be involved in response to various stresses that require reactive oxygen species.

AtXDH1 protein is a homodimer of about 300 kDa consisting of identical subunits of 150 kDa. Like xanthine dehydrogenases from other organisms AtXDH1 uses hypoxanthine and xanthine as main substrates and is strongly inhibited by allopurinol. AtXDH1 could be activated by the purified molybdenum cofactor sulfurase ABA3 that converts inactive desulfo-into active sulfoenzymes. Finally it was found that AtXDH1 is a strict dehydrogenase and not an oxidase, but is able to produce superoxide radicals indicating that besides purine catabolism it might also be involved in response to various stresses that require reactive oxygen species. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) 1The abbreviations used are: XOR, xanthine oxidoreductase; ABA, abscisic acid; AO, aldehyde oxidase; Moco, molybdenum cofactor; XDH, xanthine dehydrogenase; XO, xanthine oxidase; RT, reverse transcriptase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: XOR, xanthine oxidoreductase; ABA, abscisic acid; AO, aldehyde oxidase; Moco, molybdenum cofactor; XDH, xanthine dehydrogenase; XO, xanthine oxidase; RT, reverse transcriptase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. is a ubiquitous metalloflavo enzyme with a central role in purine catabolism where it catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. The enzyme from higher eukaryotes is active as a homodimer composed of two identical subunits of 150 kDa, each being subdivided into three domains: a N-terminal domain of 20 kDa for binding of two iron-sulfur clusters of the [2Fe-2S] type, a 40-kDa domain harboring a FAD-binding site, and a C-terminal molybdenum cofactor (Moco)-binding domain of 85 kDa. XOR enzymes in mammals are present either as the predominantly existing xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH; EC 1.1.1.204) or as O2-dependent xanthine oxidase (XO; EC 1.1.3.22). Whereas XDH possesses high reactivity toward NAD+ and low reactivity toward O2 as electron acceptor, XO reacts in a strictly O2-dependent manner with negligible reactivity toward NAD+. Both forms can be interconverted reversibly by oxidation of cysteine residues (1Stirpe F. Della Corte E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3855-3863Google Scholar), whereas the conversion of XDH into XO by limited proteolysis is irreversible (2Amaya Y. Yamazaki K. Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Google Scholar). In contrast to mammalian XOR the avian enzyme is exclusively present in the dehydrogenase form (3Sato A. Nishino T. Noda K. Amaya Y. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2818-2826Google Scholar). The ability of mammalian XO to produce superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by reducing molecular oxygen (4Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Google Scholar) led to the suggestion that it might play an important role in the pathogenesis of cellular injury (5McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Google Scholar, 6Nishino T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1-6Google Scholar). Among all XOR enzymes studied so far the bovine enzyme from milk is most exhaustively studied and recently its crystal structure has been determined for both the XDH and the XO form (7Enroth C. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Nishino T. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10723-10728Google Scholar).Besides functional characterization of XDH/XO, the corresponding nucleotide and protein sequence information was published for organisms like humans (8Wright R.M. Vaitaitis G.M. Wilson C.M. Repine T.B. Terada L.S. Repine J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10690-10694Google Scholar), cow (9Berglund L. Rasmussen J.T. Andersen M.D. Rasmussen M.S. Petersen T.E. J. Dairy Sci. 1996; 79: 198-204Google Scholar), rat (2Amaya Y. Yamazaki K. Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Google Scholar), mouse (10Terao M. Cazzaniga G. Grezzi P. Bianchi M. Falciani F. Perani P. Garattini E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 863-870Google Scholar), chicken (3Sato A. Nishino T. Noda K. Amaya Y. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2818-2826Google Scholar), insects (11Keith T.P. Riley M.A. Kreitman M. Lewontin R.C. Curtis D. Chambers G. Genetics. 1987; 116: 67-73Google Scholar, 12Komoto N. Yukuhiro K. Tamura T. Insect Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 73-83Google Scholar), fungi (13Glatigny A. Scazzocchio C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3534-3550Google Scholar), and bacteria (14Leimkuehler S. Kern M. Solomon P.S. McEwan A.G. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Klipp W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 853-869Google Scholar, 15Xi H. Schneider B.L. Reitzer L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5332-5341Google Scholar) also. With the exception of the silkworm all organisms analyzed so far possess one XOR gene.In plants the XDH but not the oxidase form was purified from nodules of bean (16Boland M.J. Biochem. Int. 1981; 2: 567-574Google Scholar), from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (17Perez-Vicente R. Alamillo J.M. Cardenas J. Pineda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 11117: 159-166Google Scholar), from wheat leaves (18Montalbini P. Plant Sci. 1998; 134: 89-102Google Scholar) and leaves of legumes (19Montalbini P. J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 156: 3-16Google Scholar), as well as from pea seedlings (20Sauer P. Frebortova J. Sebela M. Galuszka P. Jacobsen S. Pec P. Frebort I. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2002; 40: 393-400Google Scholar). All plant XDH proteins were found to be homodimers with a molecular mass of ∼300 kDa and showed highest substrate specificity for hypoxanthine and xanthine but were also able to convert purines, pterines, and aldehydes at a much lower rate. Beside purine degradation, plant XDH is supposed to play a role in important cellular processes: (i) plant-pathogen interactions between phytopathogenic fungi, legumes, and cereals (21Montalbini P. J. Phytopath. 1992; 134: 218-228Google Scholar, 22Montalbini P. Plant Sci. 1992; 87: 225-231Google Scholar); (ii) cell death associated with hypersensitive response (23Montalbini P. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1995; 46: 275-292Google Scholar, 24Montalbini P. Della Torre G. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1996; 48: 273-287Google Scholar); and (iii) natural senescence (25Pastori G.M. Del Rio L.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 411-418Google Scholar). As all these processes require the formation of reactive oxygen species XDH was supposed to be able to produce superoxide anions and/or hydrogen peroxide (25Pastori G.M. Del Rio L.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 411-418Google Scholar). Supporting this hypothesis, XDH activity was found to be increased concomitant with superoxide dismutase and other oxygen-related enzymes in senescent pea leaves (25Pastori G.M. Del Rio L.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 411-418Google Scholar). Although much effort was spent at purification and biochemical characterization of plant XDH neither cloning of the corresponding cDNAs nor molecular data are published so far.In this work we describe the cloning of two XDH cDNAs from Arabidopsis thaliana, their tandem arrangement in the genome, their mRNA expression levels as well as the enzymatic activities at various stresses and treatments, and the recombinant expression of AtXDH1 cDNA in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris with subsequent purification and characterization of the AtXDH1 protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Material and Plant Growth—A. thaliana Col-O, Ler, and aba3.2 seeds were grown in pots containing low-nutrient soil in an AR-36L A. thaliana growth chamber (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA) at 13 h light/11 h darkness, at 21 °C, and 70% relative humidity for periods as given in the text.Stress Treatment—For drought stress experiments, soil was completely removed from the roots prior to incubation under normal conditions in the chamber for 4 h or as given in the text (loss of fresh weight about 50%). Subsequently, roots and leaves were detached and used for RNA and activity analysis. ABA treatment in the case of plants without drought treatment was performed by spraying plants with 50 μm (±)-cis,trans-ABA in water uniformly onto the leaves for 4 h. In the case of combined ABA and drought treatment plants were sprayed with ABA prior to removal of plants from the soil and 2 h after removal. Treatment also lasted 4 h and control plants were sprayed with water instead of ABA solution. For NaCl treatment, 3-week-old plants were transferred to hydroponic culture 2 days before treatment and then incubated in nutrition solution containing 200 mm NaCl for 6 and 20 h. Cold stress treatment at 4 °C was performed in a chamber with ambient temperature for 6 and 20 h and freezing stress was applied by incubating plants in small chambers precooled to -4 °C. Because longer freezing stress will result in freezing of the soil freezing temperature treatment lasted only 6 h.Preparation of RNA—Total RNA was prepared either as described by Ref. 26Logemann J. Schell J. Willmitzer L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 16-20Google Scholar or by using the NucleoSpin RNA Plant kit (Macherey & Nagel, Dueren, Germany) according to the manufacturers instructions.Relative Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—For each RT reaction 2 μgof A. thaliana total RNA was reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and oligo-d(T)18-BamHI primer according to standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed on a PCR Express gradient cycler (Hybaid, Heidelberg, Germany) by using the SAWADY Taq DNA polymerase (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). AtXDH1-specific primers were AtXDH1+, 5′-CACATTTACTGAGCTAGTA-3′, and AtXDH1-,5′-GTTTCCCCTCTGATGATGTTC-3′; AtXDH2-specific primers were AtXDH2+, 5′-TCTTCTCAAGGGTAATCCA-3′, and AtXDH2-, 5′-TTCTCCCCTCTATTAAAGTTT-3′. The following PCR program was used: 3 min at 94 °C for initial denaturing of templates, 30 cycles including denaturing for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 56 °C and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C, and a final elongation step for 6 min at 72 °C. RT-PCR generated fragments were directly ligated to pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced for ascertaining proper amplification.Cloning of AtXDH2 cDNA—Two overlapping cDNA subfragments were generated by PCR from reverse transcribed total RNA of A. thaliana (Col-O) and subsequently fused by PCR according to standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The obtained full-length cDNA of AtXDH2 was directly ligated to pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced. Specific PCR primers for generation of the 5′ subfragment (2080 base pairs) were AtXDH2-ATG, 5′-GTTCAGTGAAGATGGAGCAGAAC-3′, and AtXDH2–2622rev, 5′-GCGACAAGCACACCAATA-3′. Primers for the 3′ subfragment (2085 base pairs) were AtXDH2–2400for, 5′-TTATTTGCTACAGACGTG-3′, and AtXDH2–3′, 5′-TGATCCATCTTTCTCCCC-3′.Generation of AtXDH1 Expressing P. pastoris—The cDNA clone AV548322 coding for full-length A. thaliana XDH1 was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). The yeast expression vector pPICZA with C-terminal His6 tag and P. pastors strain KM71 muts were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Standard molecular cloning techniques were used for DNA manipulation. The AtXDH1 cDNA was used as template for PCR to remove the 5′-untranslated region and stop codon and to generate a KpnI site at the 5′ end and a ApaI site at the 3′ end. Primers used for introducing restriction sites were AtXDH1 KpnI start, 5′-ATATATGGTACCATGGGTTCACTGAAAAAGGACGGC-3′, and AtXDH1 ApaI stop, 5′-ATATATGGGCCCAACACTAAGATTAGGGTAGAAATCTGA-3′. The resulting PCR fragment containing the total coding region was cloned into pPICZA. P. pastoris was transformed with pPICZA/AtXDH1 and pPICZA (vector only) by electroporation according to the manual (EasySelect Pichia expression kit version A, Invitrogen). The presence of AtXDH1 cDNA in zeocin-resistant colonies was confirmed by PCR on the P. pastoris colonies.Expression and Purification of AtXDH1—Several positive transformants were grown in 25 ml of BMGY (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.04% biotin, 1% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml zeocin) in a 250-ml baffled flask for 16–20 h (A600 2–3) at 30 °C and 150 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of BMMY (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.04% biotin, 0.3 mm sodium molybdate, and 0.5% methanol) in a 100-ml baffled flask and cultured again at 30 °C and 150 rpm. Cells were harvested after 0, 6, 10, 14, 18, 24, and 36 h of methanol induction by centrifugation and resuspended in breaking buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol). Cells were broken by vigorous vortexing with equal amounts of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma) before cell debris and glass beads were removed by centrifugation. In the resulting supernatant XDH activity was examined by activity staining after native PAGE. Strongest intensity was detected 10 h after methanol induction with a gradual decrease until 36 h of incubation. The clone showing the highest XDH activity was selected for a large scale expression culture. Cells were grown in 250 ml of BMGY in a 1-liter baffled flask for 20 h, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 50 ml of BMMY in a 500-ml baffled flask. After cultivation for 10 h in BMMY the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in breaking buffer. Depending on the quantity of cells, they were broken either by vigorous vortexing with an equal volume of glass beads at 4 °C for a total of 30 min in bursts of 30 s alternating with cooling on ice or by three passages through a French press pressure cell with 14,000 p.s.i. operating pressure. After centrifugation the supernatant was used for purification of the His-tagged AtXDH1 protein by affinity chromatography with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-superflow matrix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) under native conditions at 4 °C according to the manufacturers instructions. The sample was rebuffered to 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol. For further purification AtXDH1 was subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a Source™ 15Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A). Protein samples were applied to the column and eluted with buffer A followed by a linear gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A. Final purification and size determination was achieved by chromatography on a Superdex™ 200 HR10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA.Determination of Protein Concentrations—Concentrations of total soluble protein were determined by use of Roti Quant solution (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) according to Ref. 28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar.Wavescan of AtXDH1—Absorption spectroscopy was carried out using an Ultrospec 3000® spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences).Sequence Analysis—Sequence analysis was performed with the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit on an ABI Prism 310 cycle sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) with a pop 6 polymer.Expression of ABA3 and AOα from A. thaliana—Recombinant molybdenum cofactor sulfurase ABA3 and aldehyde oxidase AOα from A. thaliana were overexpressed and purified as described earlier in Refs. 29Bittner F.

XDH activity in plant crude extracts and recombinant AtXDH1 was visualized according to Ref. 31Mendel R.R. Mueller A. Biochem. Physiol. Pflanz. 1976; 170: 538-541Google Scholar, except that native electrophoresis in the absence of SDS was run with 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and staining solution contained 1 mm hypoxanthine as substrate, 1 mm 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and 0.1 mm phenazine methosulfate in 250 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. For standard in gel XDH activity assays, each lane were loaded either with 80 μg of plant crude extract protein or with 1 μg of recombinant AtXDH1. The in vitro reconstitution of recombinant AtXDH1 by ABA3 was performed in a total volume of 0.4 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. AtXDH1 (20 μg) was incubated with ABA3 (40 μg) in the presence of 1 mml-cysteine for 1 h at 30 °C, followed by native PAGE with ⅕ volume of the reaction mixture and activity staining with hypoxanthine as substrate. Spectrophotometric determination of XDH activity was measured at 340 nm in a 1-ml reaction mixture containing 1 mm of the respective substrate, 1 mm NAD+, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA and a suitable amount of recombinant AtXHD1. Reaction was started by addition of substrate. Inhibitors were preincubated with the enzyme for 5 min before starting the reaction. The xanthine-O2 reductase activity was measured under the same conditions but without NAD+, and O2-dependent production of uric acid was monitored at 295 nm. The production of superoxide radicals was monitored by following the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm. The specificity of O2˙--dependent reduction of cytochrome c was estimated by incorporating an excess of bovine superoxide dismutase in the assay mixture according to Refs. 32McCord J.M. Fridovich I.

Both genes were found in a tandem orientation on chromosome 4 with their reading frames pointing to the same direction (Fig. 1A). Based on the BAC clone AL079347/ATF11I11 as reference both putative XDH genes, annotated as T11I11.130 and T11I11.140 and designated by us as AtXDH1 and AtXDH2, respectively, are located within the center region of this clone with an interspace of only 704 bp. The predicted genes range from position 50,304 (ATG) to 44,057 (TGA) for T11I11.130/AtXDH1 and from position 56,627 (ATG) to 51,009 (TGA) for T11I11.140/AtXDH2, thereby spanning regions of 6,248 and 5,619 base pairs, respectively. For both predicted genes expressed sequence tags were found indicating that both genes actually are transcribed. Although these expressed sequence tags clearly showed that annotation of the putative coding sequences is not fully correct they confirmed the predicted transcription start and stop sites. Neither extended data base searches nor genomic DNA hybridizations (data not shown) revealed more than these two XDH genes within the A. thaliana genome.Complete sequencing of the A. thaliana expressed sequence tag AV548322 has shown that the full-length open reading frame of AtXDH1 is interrupted by 13 introns and contains 4083 base pairs encoding a protein of 1361 amino acids (Fig. 1B) with 47% identity to human and bovine XDH. A full-length cDNA of AtXDH2 with an open reading frame of 4059 base pairs was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using sequence information of the predicted AtXDH2 gene. The AtXDH2 gene also contains 13 introns highly conserved in exon/intron junctions compared with AtXDH1. The encoded AtXDH2 protein exhibits a length of 1353 amino acids with identities of 46% to human and bovine XDH. Both proteins, AtXDH1 and AtXDH2, reveal lower identities of 29–31% to AO proteins from A. thaliana but share overall identities of 93% to each other, indicating that they are similar to AO but functionally divergent. Full-length cDNA and protein sequences were deposited at GenBank™ (AY171562 for AtXDH1; AY518202 for AtXDH2).Comparative primary structure analysis of AtXDH1 and AtXDH2 and XOR proteins from other organisms revealed a three-domain structure for both A. thaliana XDH monomers as is typical for XOR proteins. Like the chicken XDH (2Amaya Y. Yamazaki K. Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Google Scholar) both A. thaliana XDH proteins contain a N-terminal domain including 8 strictly conserved cysteine residues for binding of two non-identical iron-sulfur clusters of the [2Fe-2S] type spanning amino acid positions 19 to 173 in AtXDH1 and 11 to 164 in AtXDH2, respectively. In each protein, the [Fe-S]-binding domain is followed by a FAD-binding domain (amino acids 260 to 440 in AtXDH1 and 252 to 432 in AtXDH2), whereas both domains are separated by hinge regions that are less conserved among all XOR proteins. FAD domains of both XDH proteins contain a FFLGYR motif (amino acids 417 to 422 in AtXDH1 and 409 to 414 in AtXDH2) that is supposed to be responsible for binding the second substrate NAD+ via the invariant tyrosine (2Amaya Y. Yamazaki K. Sato M. Noda K. Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14170-14175Google Scholar, 34Nishino T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5468-5473Google Scholar). The third and C-terminal domain includes the Moco- and substrate-binding sites as well as the dimerization motif (35Romao M.J. Archer M. Moura I. Moura J.J. LeGall J. Engh R. Schneider M. Hof P. Huber R. Science. 1995; 270: 1170-1176Google Scholar). In AtXDH1 it spans amino acid residues 612 to 1272 and in AtXDH2 604 to 1264, respectively, and is separated from the FAD/NAD domain by another hinge region. Within the Moco domain of XOR proteins both a strictly conserved glutamate and arginine residues are supposed to be essential for binding and proper positioning of purine substrates (36Glatigny A. Hof P. Romao M.J. Huber R. Scazzocchio C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 431-438Google Scholar). AtXDH1 and AtXDH2 exhibit identical residues at the corresponding positions (Glu-831 and Arg-909 in AtXDH1, Glu-832 and Arg-901 in AtXDH2) indicating that the favored substrates of both proteins should be purines rather than aldehydes.To find out at what evolutionary point XDH gene duplication might have occurred we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of XDH proteins from various eukaryotic organisms (Fig. 2). Because AO is homologous to XDH but functionally divergent we have chosen three AO proteins from A. thaliana as an outgroup. The sequences used for this analysis show a splitting into three groups, among which plant sequences clearly form their own monophyletic subgroup besides animal and fungi XDH. Therein, A. thaliana XDH gene duplication appears to have happened long after the separation of dicots and monocots. Different from A. thaliana, none of the fully sequenced genomes of rice and C. reinhardtii were found to contain more than one XDH gene. Among the animals, vertebrates, insects, and nematodes group separately. Generally, the phylogenetic tree based on XDH protein similarities mirrors the species phylogeny and gives one more indication that AtXDH1 and AtXDH2 are in fact xanthine dehydrogenases rather than aldehyde oxidases.Fig. 2Phylogenetic neighbor joining tree of XDH proteins. Full-length sequences of XDH proteins and A. thaliana AOs were aligned using ClustalX, and phylogeny of XDH proteins was constructed by use of the neighbor joining method using PAUP 4.0. Numbers in the phylogenetic tree indicate 100 bootstrap replicates. A. thaliana AO1, AO2, and AO3 were used as an outgroup. The accession numbers of the XDH sequences are as follows: AtXDH1 (AY171562), AtXDH2 (AY518202), Oryza sativa (cDNA: AK065099), C. reinhardtii (not available), Emericella nidulans (CAA58034), Neurospora crassa (EAA27223), Homo sapiens (P47989), Rattus norvegicus (P22985), Mus musculus (CAA44705), Bos taurus (CAA58497), Gallus gallus (P47990), Drosophila melanogaster (S07245), Calliphora vicina (JQ0407), B. mori XDH1 (BAA21640), B. mori XDH2 (BAB47183), and Caenorhabditis elegans (NP_502747). Accession numbers for the AOs from A. thaliana are AtAO1 (BAA28624), AtAO2 (BAA28625), and AtAO3 (BAA82672).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Differential Transcription and Enzyme Activities of AtXDH1 and AtXDH2—Because of the high similarities between the mRNAs of AtXDH1 and AtXDH2 and nearly identical transcript sizes, one cannot distinguish both transcripts by use of mRNA hybridization. Therefore we performed relative quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, using specific PCR primers designed for binding within the 3′-regions of each transcript and generating PCR fragments of 693 base pairs for AtXDH1 and 279 base pairs for AtXDH2, respectively. Proper amplification of the corresponding fragments was confirmed by sequencing.As shown in Fig. 3A expression of AtXDH1 and AtXDH2 on the mRNA level can be detected in roots, leaves, stem, flowers, and siliques, indicating that both mRNAs are ubiquitously expressed in A. thaliana, although with varying amounts. Consistent with these findings also XDH activities were found in these organs. Unfortunately, discrimination of two XDH isoforms in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels was impossible, either because of very similar physicochemical properties of both XDH proteins or because of the fact that only one isoform is actually translated. When analyzing the expression levels of AtXDH1 and AtXDH2 in plants of different age it turned out that mRNA levels of AtXDH1 increased in aging and senescent leaves, whereas AtXDH2 transcript levels remained unaltered (Fig. 3B) thereby simultaneously serving as an internal standard.

https://openalex.org/W2040602576,"The tumour suppressor gene PTEN, located at chromosome sub-band 10q23.3, encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase that negatively regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3 K)/Akt-dependent cellular survival pathway. PTEN is frequently inactivated in many tumour types including glioblastoma, prostate and endometrial cancers. While initial studies reported that PTEN gene mutations were rare in colorectal cancer, more recent reports have shown an approximate 18% incidence of somatic PTEN mutations in colorectal tumours exhibiting microsatellite instability (MSI+). To verify the role of this gene in colorectal tumorigenesis, we analysed paired normal and tumour DNA from 41 unselected primary sporadic colorectal cancers for PTEN inactivation by mutation and/or allelic loss. We now report PTEN gene mutations in 19.5% (8/41) of tumours and allele loss, including all or part of the PTEN gene, in a further 17% (7/41) of the cases. Both PTEN alleles were affected in over half (9/15) of these cases showing PTEN genetic abnormalities. Using immunohistochemistry, we have further shown that all tumours harbouring PTEN alterations have either reduced or absent PTEN expression and this correlated strongly with later clinical stage of tumour at presentation (P=0.02). In contrast to previous reports, all but one of the tumours with PTEN gene mutations were microsatellite stable (MSI-), suggesting that PTEN is involved in a distinct pathway of colorectal tumorigenesis that is separate from the pathway of mismatch repair deficiency. This work therefore establishes the importance of PTEN in primary sporadic colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2131152356,"Collimated relativistic outflows—also known as jets—are amongst the most energetic phenomena in the Universe. They are associated with supermassive black holes in distant active galactic nuclei1, accreting stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars in binary systems2 and are believed to be responsible for γ-ray bursts3. The physics of these jets, however, remains something of a mystery in that their bulk velocities, compositions and energetics remain poorly determined. Here we report the discovery of an ultra-relativistic outflow from a neutron star accreting gas within a binary stellar system. The velocity of the outflow is comparable to the fastest-moving flows observed from active galactic nuclei, and its strength is modulated by the rate of accretion of material onto the neutron star. Shocks are energized further downstream in the flow, which are themselves moving at mildly relativistic bulk velocities and are the sites of the observed synchrotron emission from the jet. We conclude that the generation of highly relativistic outflows does not require properties that are unique to black holes, such as an event horizon."
https://openalex.org/W2056802499,"Hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels have a transmembrane topology that is highly similar to voltage-gated K+ channels, yet HCN channels open in response to membrane hyperpolarization instead of depolarization. The structural basis for the “inverted” voltage dependence of HCN gating and how voltage sensing by the S1–S4 domains is coupled to the opening of the intracellular gate formed by the S6 domain are unknown. Coupling could arise from interaction between specific residues or entire transmembrane domains. We previously reported that the mutation of specific residues in the S4–S5 linker of HCN2 (i.e. Tyr-331 and Arg-339) prevented normal channel closure presumably by disruption of a crucial interaction with the activation gate. Here we hypothesized that the C-linker, a carboxyl terminus segment that connects S6 to the cyclic nucleotide binding domain, interacts with specific residues of the S4–S5 linker to mediate coupling. The recently solved structure of the C-linker of HCN2 indicates that an α-helix (the A′-helix) is located near the end of each S6 domain, the presumed location of the activation gate. Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the end of S6 and the A′-helix identified five residues that were important for normal gating as mutations disrupted channel closure. However, partial deletion of the C-linker indicated that the presence of only two of these residues was required for normal coupling. Further mutation analyses suggested that a specific electrostatic interaction between Arg-339 of the S4–S5 linker and Asp-443 of the C-linker stabilizes the closed state and thus participates in the coupling of voltage sensing and activation gating in HCN channels.

Biophysical experiments and the recently described crystal structures of bacterial K+ channels have provided remarkable insights into the physical basis for the activation and inactivation gates, selective ion permeability, and voltage sensing mechanisms of ion channels (1Doyle D.A.

In contrast, the physical basis for voltage sensor-to-gate coupling remains a relative mystery (4Larsson H.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 475-481Google Scholar). The coupling of voltage sensor movement to pore opening could involve interactions between specific residues or a more indirect interface interaction between transmembrane domains of the voltage sensor (S1–S4) and pore (S5–S6) regions. Equally puzzling is how the coupling mechanism results in opposite voltage dependence of activation for voltage-gated K+ (Kv) 1The abbreviations used are: Kv, voltage-gated K+; HCN, hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated; CNBD, cyclic nucleotide binding domain; WT, wild-type; ntHCN2, N-terminal truncated HCN2. and hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotidegated (HCN) channels. HCN channels (5Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Google Scholar, 6Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M.

Physiol. 1996; 58: 299-327Google Scholar) and If of sinoatrial nodal cells in the heart (9DiFrancesco D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 455-472Google Scholar). Opposite to Kv channels, HCN pacemaker channels are closed at potentials that are positive to -30 mV and open when the membrane is hyperpolarized. This inverted scheme of channel activation does not have an obvious structural correlate. The general topology is conserved between HCN and Kv channels, including the presence of an S4 domain with basic amino acid residues located in every third position that contributes to the sensing of transmembrane potential and an activation gate formed by the crossing of the carboxyl-terminal end of the S6 helices (10Rothberg B.S. Shin K.S. Phale P.S. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 83-91Google Scholar). How the movement of the voltage sensor is coupled to the opening and closing of the HCN or Kv channel pore is unknown, but it may involve global rearrangements of the S4, S5, and S6 transmembrane domains without the need for specific amino acid interactions (11Yellen G. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 239-295Google Scholar). However, three recent studies (12Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 663-676Google Scholar, 13Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Google Scholar, 14Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18994-19000Google Scholar) suggest that physical coupling may include specific interactions. First, voltage-dependent gating of KcsA-Shaker chimera channels required two complementary domains, the S4–S5 linker and the carboxyl-terminal end of S6 (12Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 663-676Google Scholar). Second, channel closing is disrupted by a charge-reversing mutation of a single acidic residue (D540K) in the S4–S5 linker of HERG (13Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Google Scholar). D540K HERG channels open in response to either membrane depolarization or hyperpolarization, resulting in an inverted bell-shaped voltage dependence of activation; channels are nearly fully closed at a potential of -90 mV. Hyperpolarization-activated opening of D540K HERG is specifically abolished by a second mutation of a single residue (Arg-665) located in the carboxyl-terminal end of S6 (14Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18994-19000Google Scholar), suggesting that an electrostatic repulsion between Lys-540 and Arg-665 mediates the unusual gating phenotype. These findings indicate that only a minor change in channel architecture is required to introduce HCN-like channel gating into HERG. This may be more than mere coincidence because HCN channels are more closely related to HERG than to other Kv channels. Third, the S4–S5 linker also appears to be a critical component of the coupling mechanism that mediates the hyperpolarization-dependent opening of HCN channels. Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the S4–S5 linker in HCN2 revealed that three amino acids were especially critical for normal gating. Mutation of Tyr-331 or Arg-339 (and to a lesser extent, Glu-324) disrupted channel closure (15Chen J. Mitcheson J. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lin M. Sanguinetti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Google Scholar). Based on our findings with HERG, and KcsA-Shaker chimeras by Lu et al. (12Lu Z. Klem A.M. Ramu Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 663-676Google Scholar), we hypothesized that interactions between the S4–S5 linker and a domain near the intracellular activation gate contribute to channel opening and closing of HCN2 channels. We focused on the C-linker (Fig. 1) of HCN2 in our search for residues that might participate in coupling. The structure of the C-linker was recently solved by x-ray crystallography by Zagotta et al. (16Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Google Scholar) and is defined as the portion of the carboxyl terminus that connects the end of S6 with the cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD). Here we used Ala-scanning mutagenesis and voltage clamp of Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing mutant channels to identify specific residues within or near the C-linker of HCN2 that are important for normal channel closure. Our findings suggest that a salt bridge between Asp-443 of the C-linker and Arg-339 of the S4–S5 linker stabilized the closed state of the channel. These findings provide further evidence that coupling of voltage sensing and gating are mediated at least in part by specific interactions between residues in the S4–S5 linker and residues located near the activation gate. The HCN2 channel cDNA was cloned from Marathon-Ready (Clontech) mouse brain cDNA into the pSP64T oocyte expression vector (17Chen J. Mitcheson J.S. Lin M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36465-36471Google Scholar). To facilitate subcloning, the very GC-rich N-terminal portion of the HCN2 channel (encoding amino acids 2–130) was deleted. The wild-type (WT) N-terminal-truncated channel is referred to as ntHCN2. As described previously (17Chen J. Mitcheson J.S. Lin M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36465-36471Google Scholar), the biophysical properties of ntHCN2 channels are similar to full-length HCN2 channels. All mutations were introduced into ntHCN2 cDNA as described (18Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407Google Scholar). Restriction mapping and DNA sequencing of the PCR-amplified segment were used to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and the lack of extra mutations. cRNA for injection into oocytes was prepared with SP6 Capscribe (Roche Applied Science) after linearization with EcoRI. RNA quality and quantity were determined by gel electrophoresis and UV spectroscopy. Stage IV and V X. laevis oocytes were isolated and injected (19Goldin A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 487-509Google Scholar, 20Goldin A.L. Sumikawa K. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 279-296Google Scholar) with 5–25 ng of cRNA encoding WT or mutant HCN2 channels. Oocytes were cultured in Barth's solution supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin and 1 mm pyruvate at 18 °C for 1–3 days before use. Barth's solution contained 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. For voltage clamp experiments, oocytes were bathed in a modified ND96 solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6. Currents were recorded at room temperature (23–25 °C) with standard two-microelectrode voltage clamp techniques (21Stuehmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Google Scholar). HCN2 channel currents were induced by hyperpolarizing pulses of 1–3 s, from a holding potential of -30 mV, a potential at which WT HCN2 channels were nearly completely closed. Instantaneous tail currents measured at -130 mV were corrected for leakage by subtracting the average value of the leak (less than -150 nA at -130 mV) recorded from a matched set of uninjected oocytes for each experiment. A normalized tail current amplitude (It) was plotted versus the test potential and fitted with a Boltzmann function, It = (1 - min-Po/[1 + exp ((V - V½)/k)] + min-Po, to obtain the voltage required for half-maximal activation (V½), slope factor (k), and the minimum open probability (min-Po, defined as the minimum value of relative tail current (15Chen J. Mitcheson J. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lin M. Sanguinetti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Google Scholar). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = number of oocytes). Identification of Residues in the C-linker Is Important for Normal Voltage-dependent Channel Gating—Ala-scanning mutagenesis of residues Ile-439 to Leu-442 of the S6 domain and Asp-443 to Glu-457 of the A′-helix of the C-linker (Fig. 1) was performed to determine the potential role of this region in HCN2 channel gating. The voltage dependence of activation for WT ntHCN2 and each Ala mutant was determined from currents elicited by 1–3-s hyperpolarizing pulses to test potentials ranging from -40 to -140 mV, applied in 10-mV increments. Current evoked by a hyperpolarizing test pulse was characterized by an instantaneous component and a time-dependent component that activated with a time constant of ∼350 ms at -120 mV. The rate of current activation was voltage-dependent, becoming faster at more hyperpolarized potentials (Fig. 2a). Immediately after the test pulse, a second pulse to -130 mV was applied. The initial current elicited by the pulse to -130 mV was used to define min-Po, a measure of the extent of channel closure (15Chen J. Mitcheson J. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lin M. Sanguinetti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Google Scholar). Channels capable of complete closure have a min-Po of 0, whereas channels that are always open would have a min-Po of 1.0. For WT ntHCN2 channels, the average min-Po was 0.09 ± 0.01 (n = 12). Five mutant channels failed to close normally (S441A, D443A, R447A, Y449A, and Y453A (Fig. 2A)), whereas all the others had normal gating. The min-Po for all the mutant channels examined are plotted in Fig. 2b. The min-Po for the five channels with altered gating were 0.51 ± 0.02 for S441A (n = 15), 0.79 ± 0.01 for D443A (n = 9), 0.48 ± 0.01 for R447A (n = 10), 0.87 ± 0.01 for Y449A (n = 10), and 0.62 ± 0.02 for Y453A (n = 7). The voltage dependence of channel activation was assessed by plotting the instantaneous current measured at -130 mV immediately after each test pulse. The half-point (V½) and slope factor of WT ntHCN2 were -80.9 ± 0.5 mV and 8.1 ± 0.2 mV (n = 12), respectively. The voltage dependence for activation was altered by many but not all of the Ala mutations. A large shift in V½ (-15 mV) was induced by I439A, but this mutation caused only a minor increase in min-Po. The normalized voltage dependencies for activation of the five mutant channels with the largest increase in min-Po are plotted in Fig. 2c. There was no apparent correlation between an increase in min-Po and the shift in V½ of the activation curve. The V½ values varied from -64 mV for Y453A to -96 mV for I439A (Table I). The locations of four of the five residues identified in the Ala scan are indicated in the recently solved structure of the HCN2 C-linker (A′–F′ helices in Fig. 2d). In summary, Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the end of the S6 domain and the C-linker A′-helix identified five residues that have an important but unspecified role in stabilizing the closed state of HCN2 channels.Table IVoltage dependence of activation of WT and mutant ntHCN2 channels The half-point of activation (V½) and slope factor (k) was determined from fitting data to a Boltzmann function.MutationV½knmVmVntHCN2—80.9 ± 0.58.1 ± 0.212I439A—95.6 ± 1.08.5 ± 0.410Q440A—78.8 ± 1.78.8 ± 0.511S441A—72.7 ± 0.510.5 ± 0.215L442A—92.3 ± 1.89.5 ± 0.43D443A—86.1 ± 2.811.8 ± 0.89S444A—80.9 ± 0.59.2 ± 0.214S445A—84.5 ± 0.78.4 ± 0.414R446A—80.8 ± 1.411.6 ± 0.37R447A—74.8 ± 1.212.5 ± 0.710Q448A—83.0 ± 0.49.8 ± 0.216Y449A—90.5 ± 1.16.9 ± 0.410Q450A—81.3 ± 0.57.8 ± 0.211E451A—74.7 ± 0.97.3 ± 0.19K452A—75.3 ± 1.611.4 ± 0.315Y453A—64.1 ± 1.510.1 ± 0.57K454A—80.0 ± 0.810.6 ± 0.311Q455A—78.3 ± 1.28.5 ± 0.37V456A—79.1 ± 1.411.7 ± 0.510E457A—75.4 ± 1.610.6 ± 0.45 Open table in a new tab Further Mutagenesis of C-linker Residues that Disrupt Channel Closure—The five residues we identified with the Ala scan were subjected to further mutational analysis. One conservative and several non-conservative mutations were introduced at each site, and the effect on min-Po was determined. The substitution of Ser-441 with Thr did not substantially alter gating, but substitution with another polar amino acid lacking a -OH (Asn) or Cys disrupted channel closure and increased min-Po, similar to that observed for the Ala mutation (Fig. 3a). Mutation of Asp-443 to another acidic residue (Glu) had no appreciable effect on gating, but mutation to Asn, Cys, Tyr, or basic residues (Arg or Lys) increased min-Po to 0.7 or more (Fig 3b). This finding suggests that Asp-443 might form a salt bridge with a nearby basic residue to affect activation gating. Substitution of Arg-447 with Tyr increased min-Po to 0.5, similar to R447A, whereas substitution with a conserved Lys residue or Glu did not affect min-Po (Fig. 3c). Surprisingly, closure of R447D channels (min-Po = 0.02 ± 0.01, n = 5) was more complete than WT ntHCN2 channels. The mutation of Tyr-449 to the hydrophobic residues Ala or Leu disrupted channel closure (Fig. 3d). Y449G and Y449D mutant channels closed properly. It is unclear why mutation to Ala but not Gly disrupted channel gating; also unusual were the gating behaviors of channels in which Tyr-449 was mutated to different aromatic residues. Y449F closed normally (min-Po = 0.17 ± 0.006, n = 11), but closure of Y449W channels was impaired (min-Po = 0.64 ± 0.055, n = 16) (Fig. 3d). Finally, Tyr-453 was subjected to further mutational analysis. Y453F, Y453W, and Y453D gated normally, whereas mutations to Gly, Ala, or Leu increased min-Po to approximately 0.6 (Fig. 3e). In summary, to maintain normal channel closing, a Ser or Thr amino acid was preferred at position 441, an acidic residue was required at position 443, a charged residue was preferred at position 447, and an aromatic residue was optimal at position 453; however, no consistent feature was found for position 449. It has been proposed that HCN2 channels have two distinct open states, and occupancy of one state produces an instantaneous current that is insensitive to blockage by Cs+, whereas occupancy of the other state produces the typical time- and voltage-dependent Ih that is blocked by Cs+ (22Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the effect of Cs+ on the instantaneous current induced by some of the C-linker mutations. Both the large instantaneous and smaller time-dependent currents conducted by WT, D443R, and Y449A HCN2 channels (n = 3 for each channel type) were completely blocked by the addition of 5 mm CsCl to the extracellular bath solution (data not shown). Intact C-linker Is Not Required for HCN2 Channel Gating— Truncation of all but three residues (DSS, where D is Asp-443) of the carboxyl terminus of HCN2 channels led to the loss of functional expression (23Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Google Scholar). In contrast, the equivalent deletion in HCN1 is tolerated, and the channels retain the ability to generate hyperpolarization-activated currents (23Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Google Scholar). These findings are surprising considering the similarity in sequence of HCN1 and HCN2. Because truncation of the carboxyl terminus of HCN2 was not tolerated, we explored the effects of the mutation of residues important for the structural integrity of the C-linker. Cyclic AMP binding to the CNBD of HCN2 is likely to cause a conformational change in the C-linker that is coupled to an increased pore opening ultimately via the N-terminal end of the A′-helix (16Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Google Scholar). Three Tyr residues (Tyr-476, -477, and -481) located in the B′-helix of the C-linker were proposed (16Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Google Scholar) to form H-bonding interactions with specific residues in the C′-helix of the neighboring subunit. Presumably, mutations that prevented this coupling would cause a negative shift in the voltage dependence of HCN2 activation, similar to the effect of the absence of cAMP binding to the CNBD. However, partial disruption of these interactions by mutation of single Tyr residues to Ala or the mutation of Pro-466 (to Val or Gln), located in the turn between the A′- and B′-helices, did not appreciably increase min-Po (Fig. 4, a–c) or cause a shift V½ of the voltage dependence of activation (not shown). We next determined the functional consequences of a partial deletion of the C-linker. We deleted 33 amino acids (Arg-447–480) of HCN2, a region that included most of the A′- and the entire B′-helices (Fig. 4d, upper panel). This deletion removed three of the residues identified in our Ala scan (Arg-447, Tyr-449, and Tyr-453), yet it did not shift the voltage dependence of activation (V½ = -85.0 ± 1.9 mV) and only mildly reduced channel closure (min-Po = 0.12; n = 13) (Fig. 4d, lower panel). This finding indicates that although mutations of Arg-447, Tyr-449, and Tyr-453 can disrupt normal gating, these residues are not required parts of the gating machinery. In addition, the deletion mutant highlights the predominant role for Ser-441 and Asp-443 in the coupling mechanism. Thus, an intact C-linker is crucial for cAMP-dependent modulation of HCN gating (16Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Google Scholar), but it is not required for normal voltage-dependent gating of either HCN1 or HCN2. The remaining experiments were designed to probe potential interactions between key residues in the C- and S4–S5 linkers. Electrostatic Interaction between Arg-339 of the S4–S5 Linker and Asp-443 of the C-linker—We previously reported that mutation of Tyr-331 or Arg-339 in the S4–S5 linker of ntHCN2 caused a marked increase in min-Po (15Chen J. Mitcheson J. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lin M. Sanguinetti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Google Scholar). Because the mutation of certain residues in the A′-helix of the C-linker also disrupted gating, we hypothesized that the S4–S5 linker might interact directly with the C-linker. A strategy described by Tiwari-Woodruff et al. (24Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Lin M.A. Schulteis C.T. Papazian D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 123-138Google Scholar) to probe for specific electrostatic interactions important for gating in Shaker channels was used to test for an interaction between Arg-339 of the S4–S5 linker and Asp-443 of the C-linker in HCN2. The approach was to determine whether function disrupted by a first site mutation could be rescued by the introduction of a mutation at a second site. In this case, the first site mutations were D443K (Arg, Asn, or Cys), and the second site mutations were R339D (or Glu). This pair of residues was chosen because Arg-339 and Asp-443 are located one or two residues below the intracellular end of the S5 and S6 domains and, thus, may be in close proximity to each other as proposed for the Kv channels HERG (14Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18994-19000Google Scholar) and Shaker (25Silverman W.R. Roux B. Papazian D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2935-2940Google Scholar). For these experiments, rescue was defined as the ability of R339D or R339E to restore normal gating to channels containing a mutation in Asp-443 that alone disrupted gating (Fig. 5a). The double charge reversal mutations, R339D/D443R and R339D/D443K, resulted in the complete rescue of gating (Fig. 5, b and d). Pairing of R339D and D443N mutations also resulted in a complete rescue (Fig. 5, b and d). R339D caused a partial rescue of D443C (min-Po reduced from 0.97 to 0.33) (Fig. 3b and 5d). Thus, a second site point mutation in the S4–S5 linker (R339D) was able to restore min-Po to normal values in channels in which closure was disrupted by a first site mutation of Asp-443. In contrast, R339E and R339Q were unable to rescue channel gating disrupted by D443R or D443K (Fig. 5, c and d). The finding that R339D but not R339E was able to rescue the function of Asp-443 mutations suggests a strict spatial requirement for effective electrostatic interaction. R339D also partially rescued gating disrupted by point mutations of residues in the C-linker other than Asp-443. For example, when combined with the R339D mutation, the min-Po for S441A was reduced from 0.51 ± 0.015 (n = 15) to 0.23 ± 0.003 (n = 10), and min-Po for Y453L was reduced from 0.67 ± 0.028 (n = 6) to 0.30 ± 0.01 (n = 8) (Fig. 6, a and b).Fig. 6R339D can partially rescue channel closing disrupted by mutation of single residues in the C-domain but not the S4–S5 linker. a, current traces are shown for single and double mutations as indicated.

R339D did not restore normal gating of channels disrupted by mutation of Tyr-331, another residue in the S4–S5 linker. Min-Po was 0.78 ± 0.019 (n = 6) for Y331S and 0.9 ± 0.01 (n = 5) for the Y331S/R339D double mutation (Fig. 6b and Table II). These data suggest that the S4–S5 linker and the proximal segment of the A′-helix of the C-linker are in close proximity and that Arg-339 forms a salt bridge with Asp-443 in wild-type HCN2 channels. We previously proposed an analogous role for an electrostatic interaction between Asp-540 of the S4–S5 linker and Arg-665 of the S6 domain in HERG (14Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J.

Mitcheson J. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lin M. Sanguinetti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Google Scholar). Does Tyr-331 also interact with a specific residue in the C-linker? We could find no evidence for an interaction between Tyr-331 and the specific residues identified by the Ala scan of the C-linker. Reciprocal mutations of Tyr-331 and Asp-443 or Arg-447 did not rescue function disrupted by single mutations (Table II), nor did double mutations to residues that could potentially form a salt bridge (i.e. Y331D/D443K) (Table II). A reciprocal mutation approach obviously could not be used to test for possible interaction of Tyr-331 with Tyr residues in the C-domain. Instead, mutation of Tyr-331 to Lys and Tyr-449 or Tyr-453 to Asp was examined in an attempt to induce formation of a salt bridge. However, these pairings also did not restore normal channel closure (Table II). Together, these findings support a key role for a specific electrostatic interaction between single residues in the S4–S5 linker (Arg-339) and the A′-helix of the C-linker (Asp-443). We previously used Ala-scanning mutagenesis to identify several residues of the S4–S5 linker of HCN2 that are critical for normal channel gating and hypothesized that these residues might interact with the activation gate to mediate coupling of voltage sensing to channel opening (15Chen J. Mitcheson J. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lin M. Sanguinetti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Google Scholar). In the present study, Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the C-linker was used to identify residues near the putative activation gate (10Rothberg B.S. Shin K.S. Phale P.S. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 83-91Google Scholar, 26Rothberg B.S. Shin K.S. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 501-510Google Scholar) that might participate with the S4–S5 linker in this coupling process. Based on our findings we propose that an interaction between Arg-339 in the S4–S5 linker and Asp-443 in the C-linker stabilizes the closed state of wild-type channels. An important role for electrostatic interactions in activation gating, which also involve specific residues in the C-linker, was previously proposed for cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. Replacement of three amino acids of the cone cyclic nucleotidegated channel, including two Asp residues, with the corresponding residues of the olfactory channel caused an increase in cAMP efficacy (27Zong X. Zucker H. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 353-362Google Scholar). It is unknown whether these Asp residues of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels interact with charged residues in the S4–S5 linker as we propose for HCN channels. The effects of single or double point mutations in the C-linker on HCN2 channel gating were quantified by changes in min-Po. Most of the findings (Fig. 3) were consistent with the strict physicochemical requirements of amino acid side groups to maintain normal voltage-dependent gating. For example, residue 443 must be an acidic amino acid; however, several findings were not consistent with such simple assumptions. First, the charge-reversal mutation R339E disrupted channel gating, but R339D did not. Second, charge-reversal mutations of Arg-447 permitted normal (R447E) or enhanced (R447D) channel closure, and deletion (along with 33 additional residues) had almost no effect on min-Po. Third, disrupted gating caused by D443R could be rescued by a combination with mutation of the nearby residue Arg-447 to Asp (D443R/R447D) (Fig. 7, last panel). The functional consequences of single or double charge-reversing mutations on channel gating can be reconciled if it is assumed that 1) a salt bridge must be formed between residue 339 of the S4–S5 linker and an oppositely charged residue at position 443 or 447 of the C-linker to maintain normal gating; 2) electrostatic repulsive forces can disrupt channel closure; and 3) the spacing between residues 339 and 443 is critical (i.e. functional effects of R339D versus R339E). These ideas are illustrated in Fig. 7 where an electrostatic attraction is indicated by a dotted line and repulsion is indicated by a double-headed arrow. Further studies using double Cys mutations and cross-linking agents or fluorescence resonance energy transfer are needed to further probe the importance of direct coupling between the S4–S5 and the C-linker of HCN channels. In summary, we used Ala-scanning mutagenesis to identify residues located near the putative activation gate of HCN2 that were important for normal voltage-dependent gating. Functional analyses of a deletion mutant and channels with double mutations suggest a specific electrostatic interaction between Arg-339 of the S4–S5 linker and Asp-443 of the C-linker that stabilizes the closed state of the HCN2 channel. In response to membrane hyperpolarization or specific mutations that disrupt the Arg-339-Asp-443 interaction, the open state of the channel is energetically favored. Together with our previous studies with HERG (14Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18994-19000Google Scholar), these findings provide further support for the importance of interactions between specific residues in the S4–S5 linker and the intracellular activation gate in the coupling of voltage sensing and channel opening and closing.

Here we have examined a role of SCC-S2 in cell growth regulation in vitro and in vivo. Western blotting using an antipeptide antibody revealed endogenous SCC-S2 as a ∼21 kDa cytosolic protein in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB 231) and renal carcinoma cells (RCC-RS). The immunofluorescence detection method showed the cytosolic localization of FLAG-tagged human SCC-S2 in COS-1 transfectants. MDA-MB 435 human cancer cells stably transfected with the FLAG-tagged SCC-S2 cDNA exhibited increased growth rate as compared to control vector transfectants, as measured by the cell viability (>twofold; n=3; P<0.005) and thymidine-labeling procedures (∼sixfold; n=3; P<0.0001). SCC-S2 transfectants also displayed an increase in cell migration in collagen I as compared to control transfectants (∼twofold; n=3; P<0.005). In athymic mice, SCC-S2 transfectants showed significantly enhanced tumor growth as compared to control transfectants (mean tumor volumes, day 16: control, 56.86±19.82 mm3; SCC-S2, 127.54±18.78 mm3; n=5; P<0.03). The examination of a limited number of clinical specimens revealed higher expression levels of SCC-S2 protein in certain human tumor tissues as compared to the matched normal adjacent tissues. Taken together, the present studies demonstrate SCC-S2 as a novel oncogenic factor in cancer cells."

Parvoviruses are a family of small DNA viruses comprising two subfamilies, the Parvovirinae that infect vertebrates, including man, and the Densovirinae that infect invertebrates such as insect and shrimp species. These viruses depend, because of their limited genome content, on enzymes and precursors present during the S phase of the cell for their replicative functions and thus show a proclivity for actively dividing cells. Consequently, many parvoviruses, such as the porcine parvovirus (1Bergeron J. Hebert B. Tijssen P. J.

The structure of several parvovirus capsids has been solved to nearly atomic resolution, whereas the DNA is only partly ordered (4Tsao F.H.C. Hull W.M. Stricklan M.S. Whitsett J.A. Foo T.K.F.

The capsid is composed of 60 structurally equivalent protein subunits, each containing a β-barrel jelly roll in which some loops between the β-strands intertwine with loops from neighboring subunits and cover the viral surface for specific functions such as recognition of cellular receptors. Approximately 10 out of the 60 capsid proteins have N-terminal extensions that are required for infectivity, in particular for cell entry and DNA delivery to the nucleus (6Hermonat P.L.

On the other hand, the C-terminal common structure (50–70 kDa), shared by all structural proteins of the virus, suffices to form capsids and to package DNA. The N-terminal extensions are not visualized in the x-ray structures, suggesting that they are disordered.Recently, we have identified a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) motif in the N-terminal extension (“unique part”) of the largest capsid protein, referred to as VP1, in approximately 30 different parvoviruses (8Zadori Z.

This domain, or its expressed form, has been coined as VP1up (8Zadori Z. Szelei J. Lacoste M.C. Li Y. Gariepy S. Raymond P. Allaire M. Nabi I.R. Tijssen P. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 291-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Its sequence similarity with sPLA2s is very weak and is mainly restricted to the catalytic site histidine and aspartate residues and the GXG calcium-binding motif. The viral PLA2 motifs lack cysteines, unlike all other previously characterized sPLA2s. In contrast, multiple disulfide bonds are a hallmark of all nonparvoviral sPLA2s and are used as the basis for their classification. Moreover, viral PLA2s lack the long loops between the α-helices that contain the active site residues of classical sPLA2s.Recombinant VP1up produced in Escherichia coli was shown to display enzymatic activity toward phosphatidylcholine (8Zadori Z.

A number of point mutations in the E. coli-expressed VP1up led to a significant decrease in PLA2 enzymatic activity. These mutations were also introduced into the PPV genome to investigate the role of VP1 PLA2 activity in the context of the viral cycle. Mutations that decrease enzymatic activity of VP1 (e.g. 104-fold) displayed a more than proportional decrease in infectivity. Confocal microscopy and in situ hybridization studies showed that PLA2 knockout mutants of the virus accumulated in the late endosome and lysosome and failed to deliver the viral DNA to the nucleus (8Zadori Z.

Moreover, complementation studies indicated that PLA2 activity must be present in cis with the replication-competent DNA (e.g. in the same particle) for viral DNA to accumulate and replicate in the nucleus (8Zadori Z.

It is not known whether this is due to intrinsic differences in the enzymatic efficiency of the VP1up domain or to other factors. To address this issue and to carry out a more detailed study of the interfacial kinetic and binding properties of parvoviral PLA2s, we cloned and expressed in E. coli the VP1up proteins from the parvoviruses B19, PPV, and AAV2, each of which belong to a different genus of the Parvovirinae subfamily. We also studied PLA2 enzymatic activity of a variant of the unique VP1up from PPV, lacking 58 amino acids from its C terminus (denoted M33) (8Zadori Z. Szelei J. Lacoste M.C. Li Y. Gariepy S.

Finally, the ability of the VP1 proteins to liberate fatty acids from mammalian cells was investigated. This investigation could explain whether the protein is able to hydrolyze the phospholipid membrane facilitating the penetration of the virus into the cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The plasmid pBAD/Thio-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), which produces N-terminal thioredoxin fusion proteins with a C-terminal His tag in E. coli, was used.

B19-VP1up was purified by gel filtration at 4 °C on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Protein was loaded at 2 mg/ml with a flow rate 0.5 ml/min. B19-VP1up eluted at ∼9 ml and was concentrated in a Centricon-10 to 1.5–1.8 mg/ml. To ensure complete removal of the His6-tagged TEV protease, the purified VP1up proteins were incubated with Ni-NTA resin (5 mg of VP1up/ml of Ni-NTA resin) for 30 min at room temperature with gentle swirling. The mixture was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm, and the supernatant containing B19-VP1up was stored at –20 °C after adding glycerol (see below). The AAV2-VP1up (16711 Da) and thioredoxin (11714 Da) proteins eluted as a doublet during gel filtration. Thus, to avoid contamination, only fractions of the beginning of the first peak, which contains pure AAV2-VP1up, were pooled. For all four enzymes, glycerol was added to the protein suspensions to final concentrations of 30% by volume prior to storage at –20 °C. VP1up proteins were found to be stable for at least 1.5 months.Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using A1% of 5.56, 8.0, 11.7, and 15.5 for PPV-VP1up, M33-VP1up, B19-VP1up, and AAV2-VP1up, respectively (calculated from the amino acid sequences). All of the proteins were judged to have the correct molecular mass by electrospray mass spectrometry (Voyager-DE RP spectrometer (PerSeptive; Biosystems)) and by N-terminal sequencing.Assay of VP1up PLA2 Activity—All of the VP1up proteins were assayed for PLA2 activity using the spectrofluorimetric assay with PPyrPM (11Dudler T. Chen W.-Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The specificity of the VP1up proteins for the sn-2 fatty acyl chain of phosphatidylcholine was determined using the dual radiolabel approach with 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl-phosphatidylcholine and 1-palmitoyl-2-[9,10-3H]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine as described (12Ghomashchi F.

Both the sample submitted to a heat shock by one cycle of 4 °C/65 °C/4 °C in a PCR thermocycler for 2 min at each step and the control sample were diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, with 1 mm EDTA buffer to an optical density of 0.01 at 260 nm. Virus in 100-μl samples was deposited onto nickel grids in a Beckman Airfuge ultracentrifuge at 20 p.s.i. for 5 min. After blotting with paper, the grids were deposited for 5 min on PBS and PBS/bovine serum albumin (1%) drops, respectively, and incubated for 2 h with VP1up-specific polyclonal antibodies raised in a rabbit against E. coli-expressed M33-VP1up (antiserum diluted 1/100 in PBS). The grids were then incubated, after another three washings with PBS and one washing with PBS/bovine serum albumin (1%), with gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (diluted 1/10 colloidal GoldaffiniPure Goat anti-rabbit IgG; 12 nm, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min and a final washing (three times for 1 min in PBS and twice for 40 s in water).pH Dependence of VP1up PLA2 Enzymatic Activity—The pH rate profiles for the VP1up proteins were measured with co-vesicles of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine containing 1-palmitoyl-2-[9,10-3H]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (50 Ci/mol based on total phosphatidylcholine in the assay) present at 20 μm (total phosphatidylcholine) in 100 μl of various buffers (50 mm MES, pH 5.0; 50 mm MES, pH 6.0; 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0; 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0; and 50 mm glycine, pH 9.0) containing 1 mm CaCl2. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature. Liberated free [3H]palmitic acid was quantified as described (13Ghomashchi F. Schuttel S. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H.

Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3216-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and stored for up to 2 days at 4 °C (or frozen and re-extruded). Phospholipid concentrations in stock solutions were determined by phosphate analysis (standard ammonium molybdate method). Vesicle hydrolysis studies were carried with the indicated concentrations of vesicles (Table II) in 1.3 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution with Mg2+ and Ca2+ (1 mm each) containing 13 μg of FABP and 1 μm 11-dansylundecanoic acid (Molecular Probes Inc./Invitrogen) at 37 °C with magnetic stirring using the fluorimetric assay procedure described previously (10Bezzine S.

The assays were calibrated to give moles of oleic acid formed by the addition of standard oleic acid to the reaction mixture containing all components except VP1up protein. The calcium dependence of the hydrolysis of POPG vesicles by these viral VP1up proteins was studied by using the same assay as described above except that the Ca2+ concentration varied from 0 (buffer with 1 mm EGTA) to 2.5 mm.Table IISpecific activities for the hydrolysis of phospholipid vesicles by VP1up proteinsSubstrateSpecific activityaMeasurements with vesicles of PPyrPM were performed with 1.3 μm of substrate in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM CaCl2 at room temperature.

Binding reaction samples (100 μl) contained various concentrations of vesicles in binding buffer (5 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm CaCl2). The ratio of moles of total phospholipid to moles of VP1up proteins was at least 200 to avoid crowding of protein on vesicles (10Bezzine S. Bollinger J.G. Veatch S.L. Keller S.L. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

The amount of VP1up remaining in the supernatant after pelleting the vesicles by centrifugation was measured using the PPyrPM fluorimetric assay as described above.Phospholipid Head Group Specificity Studies—Studies to measure the preference of the VP1up proteins toward phospholipids with different polar head groups were carried out using co-vesicles of POPA, POPC, POPE, POPG, POPI, and POPS as described (15Singer A.G.

The cells were cultured in 24-well plates containing 1 ml of medium/well. When cells reached ∼80% confluence, 0.1 μCi of [3H]arachidonic acid (∼100 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) was added per well. After 24 h at 37 °C (humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2), the cells were washed three times with complete medium, and 1 ml of complete medium was added. VP1up protein was then added in amounts as given in the legend to Fig. 6. The medium was removed after the indicated time period at 37 °C (see legend to Fig. 6) and centrifuged briefly to pellet any dislodged cells, and then 0.5 ml of supernatant was submitted to scintillation counting. The cell layer remaining in the well was treated with trypsin/EDTA, and the cell suspension was submitted to scintillation counting. Arachidonic acid release is expressed as a percentage of cpm released to the culture medium divided by total cpm (released plus cell associated).RESULTSCloning, Expression, and Purification of Parvovirus VP1up PLA2-like Proteins—The regions of the viral DNAs coding for PLA2 from four different parvoviruses proteins (PPV-VP1up, M33-VP1up, AAV2-VP1up, and B19-VP1up), were amplified by PCR, and the products were inserted into a bacterial expression vector. The N-terminal thioredoxin and the C-terminal His (6Hermonat P.L. Labow M.A. Wright R. Berns K.I. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 329-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) affinity tag in these fusion proteins were released from the VP1up domain by cleavage with TEV protease. Typically, 5-fold higher expression levels of fusion proteins were obtained using a host strain that contains extra copies of tRNA genes that recognize codons that are rare in E. coli (BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL) compared with expression in the standard strain BL21(DE3). Chromatography of M33-VP1up on a Ni-NTA column followed by a heparin-Sepharose column gave a protein that was >99% pure (Fig. 1), whereas PPV-VP1up eluted as two bands, as shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), because of the incomplete cleavage of the fusion protein by TEV protease. The slower moving band could be removed by passing the TEV digestion mixture again through a Ni-NTA column (not shown). B19-VP1up and AAV2-VP1up were purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1) by passage over an Ni-NTA column, followed by a gel filtration column, and finally a second Ni-NTA. Using this expression system, yields of 3–5 mg/liter of bacterial culture were obtained for each protein of the four viral PLA2s.Fig. 1SDS-PAGE analysis of purified VP1up proteins. Lane 1 is 3 μg of M33-VP1up, lane 2 is 4 μg of PPV-VP1up, lane 3 is 2 μg of AAV2-VP1up, and lane 4 is 2.5 μg of B19-VP1up. MW, molecular mass.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)VP1up Proteins Are Active PLA2s—Initially, the specific activity of the four expressed VP1up proteins were tested using the fluorimetric assay with vesicles of the anionic phospholipid PPyrPM (11Dudler T. Chen W.-Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The results (Table II) showed specific activities of 9.7 and 16 μmol/(min mg), respectively, for PPV-VP1up and M33-VP1up. On the other hand, B19-VP1up and AAV2-VP1up were approximately 2 orders of magnitude less active than PPV-VP1up and M33-VP1up on PPyrPM vesicles (Table II). The kinetic data obtained with these recombinant VP1up proteins, produced in a heterologous host, established that these viral proteins are capable of functioning as PLA2s.PPV Externalizes Its PLA2 Domain Following Heat Treatment—Previously, we observed that the PLA2 activity of PPV virus was greatly enhanced when the capsid was chemically disrupted or when the virus was submitted to a thermal shock (8Zadori Z. Szelei J. Lacoste M.C. Li Y. Gariepy S. Raymond P. Allaire M. Nabi I.R. Tijssen P. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 291-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), suggesting that the PLA2-bearing domain of VP1 of PPV is buried within the native virus particle and needs to be externalized for PLA2 activity of the virus on membranes. To examine whether heat treatment of PPV exposes the PLA2 domain on intact viral particles, we used immunogold electron microscopy to visualize the VP1up domain of PPV using a polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbits against E. coli-expressed M33-VP1up, and the results are summarized in Fig. 2. With purified virus, only a low level of gold particles was seen. In contrast, the detection of the VP1up domain was dramatically enhanced when viral particles were treated at 65 or 72 °C (not shown) for 2 min. The capsids dissociated when the temperature was increased to 75–85 °C (not shown). These results fit with our earlier report that the PLA2 enzymatic activity of PPV virus particles is enhanced after heat shock and is consistent with the PLA2 enzymatic activity of the virus particles residing in the VP1up domain.Fig. 2Immunogold electron microscopy detection of VP1up domain of PPV. Virus was deposited onto nickel grids, and the VP1up domain was visualized with VP1up-specific polyclonal antiserum prepared in E. coli against M33-VP1up protein. A, purified virus before heat shock.

It is unclear whether this process occurs at the cell membrane or via endocytosis. Our group previously identified an alternative mRNA splicing variant of SR-BI, named SR-BII, with an entirely different, yet highly conserved cytoplasmic C terminus. In this study we aimed to compare HDL uptake by both isoforms. Whereas SR-BI was mainly (∼70%) localized on the surface of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, as determined by biotinylation, HDL binding at 4 °C, and studies of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged SR-BI/II fusion proteins, the majority of SR-BII (∼80-90%) was expressed intracellularly. The cellular distribution of SR-BI was not affected by deletion of the C terminus, which suggests that the distinct C terminus of SR-BII is responsible for its intracellular expression. Pulse-chase experiments showed that SR-BII rapidly internalized HDL protein, whereas in the case of SR-BI most HDL protein remained surface bound. Like its ligand, SR-BII was more rapidly endocytosed compared with SR-BI. Despite more rapid HDL uptake by SR-BII than SR-BI, selective cholesteryl ether uptake was significantly lower. Relative to their levels of expression at the cell surface, however, both isoforms mediated selective uptake with similar efficiency. HDL protein that was internalized by SR-BII largely co-localized with transferrin in the endosomal recycling compartment. Within the endosomal recycling compartment of SR-BII cells, there was extensive co-localization of internalized HDL lipid and protein. These results do not support a model that selective lipid uptake by SR-BI requires receptor/ligand recycling within the cell. We conclude that SR-BII may influence cellular cholesterol trafficking and homeostasis in a manner that is distinct from SR-BI.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Google Scholar), plays an important role in reverse cholesterol transport, a major pathway for the clearance of excess cholesterol from the body. In this process, peripheral cholesterol is packaged into HDL from which it is subsequently removed in the liver and excreted into bile. SR-BI mediates the uptake and biliary secretion of HDL cholesterol by the liver (4Rigotti A. Miettinen H.E. Krieger M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 357-387Google Scholar, 5Mardones P. Quinones V. Amigo L.

Therefore, and perhaps also for other reasons, SR-BI is of great importance in the prevention of atherosclerosis (6Trigatti B.L. Krieger M. Rigotti A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1732-1738Google Scholar). SR-BI is most highly expressed in liver and steroidogenic tissues (4Rigotti A. Miettinen H.E. Krieger M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 357-387Google Scholar), where it mediates selective uptake of cholesterol from HDL, i.e. without concomitant uptake and degradation of HDL apoproteins. The detailed mechanism of this process has not been elucidated yet, including whether it occurs at the cell membrane (7Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Google Scholar) or during endocytosis and retroendocytosis of HDL (8Silver D.L. Wang N. Xiao X. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

SR-BI is a ∼82-kDa protein with two short cytoplasmic termini, two transmembrane domains, and a large, heavily glycosylated extracellular loop (2Krieger M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 793-797Google Scholar). In nonpolarized cultured cells, only the extracellular loop of SR-BI is essential for selective uptake (13Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Google Scholar, 14Gu X. Trigatti B. Xu S. Acton S. Babitt J. Krieger M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5249-5259Google Scholar); both the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic tails can be deleted or exchanged with the corresponding region of the other class B receptor CD36 (14Gu X.

Klein S.M. Rothblat G.H. Williams D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5249-5259Google Scholar). Cooperation of other proteins with SR-BI seems not to be essential for this process, because mere liposomes containing purified SR-BI can selectively absorb HDL cholesterol (16Liu B. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34125-34135Google Scholar). However, in polarized hepatocytes, the interaction of the C terminus of SR-BI with a protein called CLAMP, or PDZK1, is required for cell surface expression of the receptor (17Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Google Scholar, 18Silver D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Google Scholar). A domain consisting of the three C-terminal amino acids in murine SR-BI, Arg-Lys-Leu, is required for binding PDZK1. Lack of the terminal leucine residue results in decreased surface expression of SR-BI in the mouse hepatocyte and consequently to impaired HDL clearance (18Silver D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Google Scholar). Previously, our group discovered an alternative mRNA splicing variant of SR-BI, called SR-BII, which differs from SR-BI by an entirely different C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (19Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Google Scholar, 20Webb N.R. de Villiers W.J.S. Connell P.M. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1490-1495Google Scholar). In liver, adrenals, adipose, and testicular tissue, SR-BII mRNA levels are comparable with the SR-BI isoform, although protein levels are lower (19Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in the liver, SR-BII accounts for some 10-15% of SR-BI/II protein, and in rats treated with 17β-estradiol, SR-BII in liver is substantially up-regulated (21Graf G.A. Roswell K.L. Smart E.J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1444-1449Google Scholar). SR-BII protein was also detected in human retinal epithelial cells (22Duncan K.G. Bailey K.R. Kane J.P. Schwartz D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1017-1022Google Scholar) and in rat Leydig cells (23Reaven E. Zhan L. Nomoto A. Leers-Sucheta S. Azhar S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 343-356Google Scholar). Another indicator for a possible biological function of SR-BII is the high degree of conservation of the C terminus between various species (19Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Google Scholar). The presence of an entirely different C terminus in SR-BII is intriguing in light of the reported critical importance of the corresponding domain in the cellular distribution of SR-BI. In the present study we investigated SR-BII expression in more detail, focusing on its cellular distribution and interaction with HDL. Our data show that SR-BII is mainly expressed intracellularly in nonpolarized (CHO) cells, with reduced selective uptake capacity. In contrast to SR-BI, SR-BII appeared to mediate the rapid internalization of HDL particles and their accumulation in the transferrin-positive endosomal recycling compartment (ERC). Our results suggest that selective lipid uptake by SR-BI does not require receptor/ligand recycling. SR-BII may influence cellular cholesterol trafficking and homeostasis in a manner distinct from SR-BI. Cells—CHO-A7 cells (donated by Dr. M. Krieger, M.I.T.) were grown in 250-ml tissue culture flasks in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). MDCK and COS cells (both American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Both media were supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 50 units/liter penicillin G, and 50 μg/liter streptomycin (all Invitrogen). The cells were subcultured until 70% confluency was reached, using a 1:5 split ratio. Stably transfected CHO cells expressing murine SR-BI or SR-BII were generated as described elsewhere (19Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Google Scholar) and were cultured in medium containing 0.25 g/liter geneticin (Invitrogen). The clones were screened for expression of the scavenger receptors by immunoblotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing the common extracellular domain (red-1, for receptor extracellular domain 1) (19Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Google Scholar); one of each clone was selected based on similar expression levels (CHO-SRBI and CHO-SRBII). COS cells were transiently transfected with pCMV5-based expression vectors (24Andersson S. Davis D. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Google Scholar) (1 μg of DNA/ml) using the Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen), and the cells were used experimentally 16 h after transfection. For biochemical assays, CHO and COS cells were grown in 12-well clusters (Corning Corp., Corning, NY). For microscopy, CHO and COS cells were grown on glass coverslips, and MDCK cells were grown on Transwell Clear® filter membranes (Corning). Isolation and Labeling of Lipoproteins—Human HDL (ρ = 1.063-1.21 g/ml) fractions were isolated from fresh human plasma by density gradient ultracentrifugation as previously described (25Strachan A.F. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Coetzee G.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 203-207Google Scholar). Human HDL3 (ρ = 1.13-1.18 g/ml) was obtained from total HDL by density gradient fractionation. All of the isolated fractions were dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, sterile filtered, and stored under N2 gas at 4 °C. The lipoproteins were iodinated in presence of 125I (Amersham Biosciences) by the iodine monochloride method (26Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Google Scholar). HDL-associated cholesteryl ester was traced with nonhydrolyzable [1, 2(n)-3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether (Amersham Biosciences) according to the method of Gwynne and Mahaffee (27Gwynne J.T. Mahaffee D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8141-8150Google Scholar), with the following modifications: [1,2(n)-3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether was dried in a 12 × 75-mm borosilicate glass tube (20 μCi/mg HDL protein), after which HDL and partially purified cholesteryl ester transfer protein were added. Following 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, HDL was reisolated by ultracentrifugation at a density of 1.21 g/ml. The specific activity of the [3H]-HDL ranged from 10-30 dpm/mg protein. Labeled lipoproteins were verified by SDS-PAGE and gradient gel electrophoresis. HDL3 lipid was labeled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described elsewhere (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar) and protein with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were stored at 4 °C under N2 gas. HDL Association and Selective Uptake—Cell association assays were performed as previously described (19Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Google Scholar), in radiolabeled lipoprotein-containing medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) instead of serum. The cells were seeded on 12-well cell culture clusters at an initial density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2. When the cells reached confluency, they were either incubated at 37 °C for indicated times or at 4 °C for 2 h with double-labeled HDL3, in the latter case with HEPES-buffer instead of bi-carbonate. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed four times with cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing BSA (2 mg/ml) followed by two washes in the same buffer without BSA. The cells were then solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH for 60 min at room temperature, and the proteins and radioactivity were measured in the lysate. 125I represented HDL protein association according to the protein tracer, and 3H represented that according to the cholesteryl-ether tracer. The trichloroacetic acid-soluble degraded material in cell medium was assayed as described (19Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Google Scholar). The values are expressed as apparent HDL protein uptake assuming the uptake of intact holoparticles. This was done to compare association of both tracers on the same basis. Selective uptake is defined as [3H] - ([125I] cell associated + [125I] degraded) and represents the uptake of cholesteryl ester that cannot be accounted for by the internalization of intact particles. SR-BI/II-specific values were calculated as the difference between CHO-SR-BI/II and CHO-A7 values. Biotinylation of SR-BI and SR-BII—Biotinylation was carried out as described elsewhere (28McGwire G.B. Becker R.P. Skidgel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31632-31640Google Scholar), with slight modifications. CHO cells were incubated in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium with 0.5% BSA for 2 h prior to the experiment. After washing cells five times with cold PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-CM), the cells were incubated on ice twice for 20 min each with 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce), in PBS-CM. Unbound biotin was inactivated and removed by a 5-min wash with Tris-buffered saline-CM followed by two washes with PBS-CM. The cells were solubilized with cold MES-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100 and 1.75% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (MBSTOG) supplemented with Complete-Mini® protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations of cell lysates were estimated with a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), whereupon 5 μg of protein lysate were incubated with the pellet of 50 μl of immobilized, BSA-blocked streptavidin beads (Sigma) for 16 h, at 4 °C. The supernatant (representing intracellular proteins) and the pellet (representing surface proteins), the latter twice washed with 0.5 ml of MBSTOG, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the red-1 antibody. To study potential redistribution of receptor in response to exposure to HDL, the cells were incubated overnight with medium containing 0.5% BSA instead of serum, followed by 5 h in the absence or presence of 50 μg/ml unlabeled human HDL3. Biotinylation was performed immediately after this incubation. Uptake of HDL and Transferrin—The cells were grown on glass coverslips until 50-70% confluency and were incubated in serum-free medium containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C before the addition of DiI- or Alexa-labeled HDL3 (10 μg/ml, unless indicated otherwise). The cells were either continuously labeled with ligand at 37 °C or for 2 h at 4 °C followed by cold washes with PBS-CM and a subsequent 37 °C chase with complete medium. After the incubations, the cells were washed five times with cold PBS-CM and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The cells were then mounted on glass slides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed with an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope or a Leica TCS confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope. To visualize the endosomal recycling compartment, the cells were incubated for 1 h with Alexa 568-labeled human transferrin (Molecular Probes), at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Internalization of SR-BI and SR-BII—COS cells grown on glass coverslips till 50% confluency were transfected with the pCMV-5-based vector encoding the appropriate scavenger receptor and were incubated overnight in complete medium. Before the experiment, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium with 0.5% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C and put on ice. The cells were then incubated with red-1 antibody (1:200) in PBS with 0.5% BSA for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed with PBS-CM, incubated with complete medium for various times at 37 °C, washed with cold PBS-CM to prevent further endocytosis, fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized with cold 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Thereafter, secondary antibody, Cyanine Cy2 (green)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was added for 30 min. The cells were mounted on glass slides in Vectashield mounting medium and were observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope. Construction of Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein Fusion Proteins—pCMV-5-based expression vectors encoding SR-BI or SR-BII (19Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Google Scholar) were PCR-amplified with the forward oligonucleotide 5′-CAT AGA TCT ATG GGC GGC AGC TCC AGG GCG-3′ and the reverse oligonucleotides 5′-TAT AGG GCC CTA TAG CTT GGC TTC TTG-3′ and 5′-GCC TGA GGG CCC TCA GGC CAT GGC ACT GGT GGG-3′, respectively. The resulting products were digested with BglII and ApaI and introduced into similarly digested pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The resulting recombinant expression vector encodes EGFP-SRBI/II fusion proteins with the enhanced EGFP signal at the N terminus of the receptor. The DNA sequence of the coding region was verified, and protein expression and function were studied in transfected COS cells. All EGFP fusion proteins were found to yield SR-BI/II immunoreactive proteins of predicted size, and COS cells expressing these constructs showed HDL binding and selective uptake comparable with COS cells expressing non-EGFP SR-BI/II (not shown). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Deletion of the C terminus of murine SR-BI in the pEGFP-C1 expression vector was achieved by introducing a stop codon at Q463, employing the PCR-based QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and primer pair 5′-GTG CCC ATC ATC TGC TAA CTG CGC AGC CAG GAG-3′ and 5′-CTC CTG GCT GCG CAG TTA GCA GAT GAT GGG CAC-3′. Immunoblotting of transfected COS cell extracts yielded an immunoreactive protein with the predicted size (not shown). Expression of SR-BII—Stably transfected CHO-A7 clones were screened by immunoblotting for expression of murine SR-BI or SR-BII using the red-1 antibody, which detects the common extracellular domain of the receptors (19Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Google Scholar). Two lines expressing similar amounts of either SR-BI (CHO-SRBI) or SR-BII (CHO-SRBII) were selected. Surface expression of both isoforms was studied by a biotinylation approach. In CHO-SRBI cells labeled at 4 °C with nonabsorbable biotin, approximately ∼70% of total scavenger receptor could be precipitated with immobilized streptavidin, indicating that this isoform was mainly expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 1A). In the case of CHO-SRBII cells, only ∼10-20% of SR-BII protein could be precipitated, indicating that this isoform is much less expressed on the cell surface, with 80-90% being expressed intracellularly. The surface expression of both receptors was unchanged by 5 h of exposure of cells to HDL in the medium, as opposed to cells not exposed to HDL (Fig. 1B), indicating that the presence of the ligand did not induce the redistribution of receptors. The distinct cellular distribution of SR-BI and SR-BII was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy of CHO cells expressing EGFP fusion constructs of either SR-BI or SR-BII. These fusion proteins were functionally active, as shown by their capacity to mediate selective uptake with an efficiency similar to non-EGFP isoforms in transiently transfected COS cells (not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, SR-BI is highly expressed on the cell surface, whereas SR-BII is expressed predominantly intracellularly with little enrichment of the cell surface being evident (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, EGFP-SRBI lacking the normal cytoplasmic C terminus showed a cellular distribution (Fig. 2C) similar to that of full-length EGFP-SRBI, suggesting that the presence of the SR-BII C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, and not the absence of the SR-BI C terminus, is responsible for the more intracellular distribution of SR-BII. Fig. 2D shows cells expressing only EGFP protein in a diffuse intracellular manner. The marked difference in the intracellular localization of SR-BI and SR-BII was also observed in stably transfected polarized MDCK cells. EGFP-SRBI is predominantly expressed on the cell surface of these cells (Fig. 2E), mostly on the basal membrane (Fig. 2F). In contrast, EGFP-SRBII is localized mainly intracellularly (Fig. 2, G and H). HDL Binding and Selective Uptake—The predominantly intracellular expression of SR-BII was in line with the observation that receptor-specific binding of HDL at 4 °C was significantly lower for CHO-SRBII than CHO-SRBI cells (Fig. 3A), whereas receptor levels in the two cell types were similar (data not shown). Receptor-specific cell association of HDL and selective cholesteryl-ester uptake at 37 °C were also measured. Unlike HDL binding at 4 °C, cell association at 37 °C was similar for SR-BI- and SR-BII-expressing cells (Fig. 3B). Both receptors mediated selective uptake, but this was significantly lower for SR-BII (Fig. 3C). For both receptors, HDL protein degradation was low, indicating little delivery of ligand to lysosomes via typical endocytic pathways (Fig. 3D). If the efficiency of selective uptake is expressed as selective uptake relative to cell associated HDL at 37 °C, the efficiency of SR-BII was ∼2-fold lower than SR-BI. However, when the efficiency of selective uptake is calculated relative to the number of receptors at the cell surface, calculated from HDL binding at 4 °C, the efficiencies of uptake for SR-BI and SR-BII are similar. The relatively greater difference between HDL cell association at 37 and 4 °C in the case of SR-BII, compared with SR-BI, suggests that, at 37 °C, SR-BII may accumulate HDL in an intracellular compartment to a greater extent than SR-BI. Cell association and selective uptake, as a function of time, are shown in Fig. 4. Cell association for both SR-BI and SR-BII reached a plateau after 1-2 h (Fig. 4A), whereas the selective uptake in cells continued over time (Fig. 4B). These results are consistent with the previously described selective uptake process (29Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Google Scholar).Fig. 4Time course of HDL cell association and selective uptake. A time course of 37 °C cell association of 10 μg/ml [3H]/125I double-labeled HDL3 with CHO-SRBI cells (closed symbols) or CHO-SRBII cells (open symbols) is shown in A, as is receptor-specific selective uptake from these ligands (B). The points represent the averages of three values and are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Intracellular Distribution of HDL Lipids and Proteins—To assess possible HDL particle uptake, CHO cells were first incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with HDL3 labeled with Alexa 488 in the protein moiety and then washed and incubated at 37 °C in medium for 1 h. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed surface binding of HDL at 4 °C to both SR-BI-expressing (Fig. 5A) and SR-BII-expressing (Fig. 5B) cells. Following incubation at 37 °C, the cell-associated HDL remained largely localized at the cell surface in the case of SR-BI (Fig. 5C). In contrast, significant amounts of surface-bound HDL3 were internalized by CHO-SRBII cells (Fig. 5D). No significant cell association of Alexa-labeled HDL was observed in CHO-A7 cells that do not express SR-BI or SR-BII (data not shown). When cells were continuously exposed to Alexa-labeled HDL3 at 37 °C, for up to 120 min, CHO-SRBI cells accumulated limited amounts of HDL protein intracellularly, with the majority of the ligand after 30 min (Fig. 5E) and 120 min (Fig. 5G) being associated with the cell surface. In the case of CHO-SRBII cells, significant amounts of ligand were rapidly taken up, such that the amount of surface-bound ligand was small compared with intracellular ligand (Fig. 5, F and H). To study HDL particle uptake in more detail, CHO cells were incubated with a mixture of DiI- and Alexa 488-labeled HDL3. After a 1-h continuous pulse at 37 °C, CHO-SRBI cells appeared to accumulate some HDL protein within the cell, yet most HDL protein remained on or in proximity to the cell membrane (Fig. 6A). There appeared to be some heterogeneity in terms of protein distribution, however, with some cells showing more intracellular accumulation of HDL protein than others. Although most DiI label was clearly enriched in the plasma membrane and co-localized with Alexa, in the case of CHO-SRBI cells, a significant portion of DiI appeared dissociated from the protein fraction and was dispersed throughout the cell (Fig. 6, C and E). This is consistent with selective lipid uptake mediated by SR-BI (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar). In CHO-SRBII cells, in contrast, most of the HDL proteins and lipids were accumulated in a perinuclear region, with strong co-localization of both HDL components (Fig. 6, B, D, and F). Although co-localization suggests that the protein and lipid fractions of HDL remain associated, at this resolution it canno"
https://openalex.org/W2052933733,"The Ras homolog enriched in striatum, Rhes, is the product of a thyroid hormone-regulated gene during brain development. Rhes and the dexamethasone-induced Dexras1 define a novel distinct subfamily of proteins within the Ras family, characterized by an extended variable domain in the carboxyl terminal region. We have carried this study because there is a complete lack of knowledge on Rhes signaling. We show that in PC12 cells, Rhes is targeted to the plasma membrane by farnesylation. We demonstrate that about 30% of the native Rhes protein is bound to GTP and this proportion is unaltered by typical Ras family nucleotide exchange factors. However, Rhes is not transforming in murine fibroblasts. We have also examined the role of Rhes in cell signaling. Rhes does not stimulate the ERK pathway. By contrast, it binds to and activates PI3K. On the other hand, we demonstrate that Rhes impairs the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway by thyroid-stimulating hormone, and by an activated beta2 adrenergic receptor by a mechanism that suggests uncoupling of the receptor to its cognate heterotrimeric complex. Overall, our results provide the initial insights into the role in signal transduction of this novel Ras family member."
https://openalex.org/W2050234810,"The neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene product, merlin, belongs to the ezrin–radixin–moesin (ERM) subgroup of the Protein 4.1 family, which links cell surface glycoproteins to the actin cytoskeleton. Previous studies have suggested that phosphorylation of merlin, similar to other ERM proteins, may regulate its function. To determine whether merlin phosphorylation has functional consequences for merlin suppression of cell growth and motility, we generated doxycycline-regulatable RT4 schwannoma cell lines that inducibly express full-length merlin with mutations at two potential phosphorylation sites (amino-acid residues S518 and T576). Whereas a mutation at S518 that mimics constitutive phosphorylation (S518D) abrogates the ability of merlin to suppress cell growth and motility, the S518A merlin mutant, which mimics nonphosphorylated merlin, functions equivalently to wild-type merlin. Similar mutations involving T576, the analogous phosphorylation site in ERM proteins important for regulating their function, had no effect. In contrast to other functionally inactive missense merlin mutants, the regulated overexpression of S518D merlin resulted in dramatic changes in cell shape and the elaboration of filopodial extensions. These results provide the first direct demonstration that the S518D merlin mutation, which mimics merlin phosphorylation, impairs not only merlin growth and motility suppression but also leads to an acquisition of a novel phenotype previously ascribed to ERM proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2008913484,"Her-2/neu (ErbB2) oncogene, the second member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor in Her-2-positive tumors. Accumulating evidences demonstrate that signaling networks activated by EGFR and transcription factor NF-kappaB are associated with cell response to ionizing radiation (IR). The present study shows that overexpression of ErbB2 enhanced NF-kappaB activation induced by IR in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells transfected with ErbB2 genes (MCF-7/ErbB2). Stable transfection of dominant-negative mutant IkappaB (MCF-7/ErbB2/mIkappaB) or treatment with anti-ErbB2 antibody, Herceptin, inhibited NF-kappaB activation and radiosensitized MCF-7/ErbB2 cells. Consistent with NF-kappaB regulation, basal and IR-induced Akt, a kinase downstream of ErbB2, was activated in MCF-7/ErbB2 cells and inhibited by Herceptin. To identify specific genes affected by ErbB2-mediated NF-kappaB activation, a group of IR-responsive elements Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Bcl/XL, BAD and BAX were evaluated. Basal levels of prosurvival elements Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1, Bcl-2 and Bcl/XL but not apoptotic BAD and BAX were upregulated in MCF-7/ErbB2 cells with striking enhancements in Bcl-2 and Bcl/XL. IR further induced Cyclin B1 and Cyclin D1 expression that was reduced by Herceptin. Bcl-2 kept a high steady level after Herceptin+IR treatment and, in contrast to control MCF-7/Vector cells, Bcl/XL was inhibited in MCF-7/ErbB2 cells by Herceptin+IR treatment. However, all four prosurvival proteins were downregulated by inhibition of NF-kappaB in MCF-7/ErbB2/mIkappaB cells. These results thus provide evidence suggesting that overexpression of ErbB2 is able to enhance NF-kappaB response to IR, and that a specific prosurvival network downstream of NF-kappaB is triggered by treatments using anti-ErbB2 antibody combined with radiation."

QacR is induced by multiple structurally dissimilar monovalent and bivalent cationic lipophilic compounds, many of which are effluxed from the cell by QacA via the proton motive force. The multidrug-binding pocket of QacR has been shown to be quite extensive and features several glutamates and multiple aromatic residues. To date, the structure of only one QacR-bivalent cationic drug complex (that of QacR bound to dequalinium) has been determined, and how other longer or shorter bivalent cationic compounds bind is unknown. Here we report the crystal structures of QacR bound to two cytotoxic bivalent diamidines, pentamidine and hexamidine. These compounds are structurally similar, differing by only one methylene carbon in the alkyl chain linker. However, this small difference results in very dissimilar binding modes. Similar to dequalinium, hexamidine spans the multidrug-binding pocket, and its positively charged benzamidine groups are neutralized by residues Glu-57 and Glu-120. Pentamidine binds QacR in a novel fashion whereby one of its benzamidine groups interacts with residue Glu-63, and the other is neutralized by carbonyl and side chain oxygen atoms.

In bacteria, multidrug efflux transporters protect these organisms from myriad clinically relevant antimicrobials by their ability to pump these compounds from the cell and thereby preventing their accumulation to toxic levels (1Levy S.B.

Some of these resistant strains harbor plasmid-encoded multidrug resistant efflux pumps such as QacA, which confers resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) 1The abbreviations used are: QACs, quaternary ammonium compounds; R6G, rhodamine 6G; Et, ethidium.

Lett. 1992; 74: 259-265Google Scholar). QACs comprise a broad spectrum of mono- and bivalent cationic lipophilic antimicrobials, antiseptics, and disinfectants. The transcription of the qacA gene is controlled by the repressor QacR (10Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Roberts N.J. Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18665-18673Google Scholar). QacR is a dimeric 188-residue (23-kDa) member of the TetR/CamR transcription regulator family (11Aramaki H. Yagi N. Suzuki M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1259-1266Google Scholar). The signature elements of the TetR/CamR family are a homologous three helix N-terminal DNA-binding domain and diverse C-terminal domains that are utilized in binding protein-specific inducing compounds. Most TetR/CamR family members bind as dimers to ∼15-bp operator sites. However, QacR binds to an unusually long site in the qacA promoter (IR1, consisting of 28 bp) that overlaps the qacA transcription start site (10Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Roberts N.J. Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18665-18673Google Scholar). QacR binds to IR1 as a dimer of dimers and likely functions as a repressor by preventing the RNA polymerase-promoter complex from entering a productive transcribing state rather than blocking RNA polymerase binding (10Grkovic S.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7102-7109Google Scholar, 13Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1210-1218Google Scholar). QacR is induced by multiple structurally dissimilar lipophilic monovalent and bivalent cationic compounds, which also serve as substrates of the QacA efflux pump. Upon binding one of these compounds in a one drug/QacR dimer stoichiometry, a coil-to-helix transition involving residues Thr-89 through Tyr-93 is triggered in the drug-bound subunit, resulting in the expulsion of residues Tyr-92 and Tyr-93 from the interior of the protein and the formation of the drug-binding pocket (Fig. 1) (14Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Google Scholar). This key conformational change brings about the elongation of helix α5 by one turn, which in turn causes the translocation of helix α6 toward the DNA-binding domain. Helix α6 engages in multiple interactions with helix α1 of the DNA-binding domain, and its movement results in the translation and rotation of the DNA-binding domain of the drug-bound subunit by 9.1 Å and 36.7°, respectively (14Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Google Scholar). The drug-free subunit undergoes a smaller translation (3.9 Å) and rotation (18.3°). The end result of these conformational changes is an increase in the center-to-center distance of the DNA recognition helices by over 9 Å, resulting in a structure that can no longer bind the IR1 site, thus allowing the qacA gene to be transcribed. The drug-binding pocket of QacR is quite extensive and displays a volume of 1100 Å3 (14Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Google Scholar). This pocket has been described as having two independent but overlapping drug-binding sites that are designated the rhodamine 6G (R6G) and ethidium (Et) sites after their respectively bound drugs (14Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Google Scholar). A key feature of the binding pocket is the presence of several glutamates and a large number of aromatic residues. Combinations of these residues are used to define the specific drug-binding sites and provide maximal shape, chemical, and electrostatic complementarity (14Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Google Scholar). Hallmark residues of the R6G pocket include stacking residues Trp-61, Tyr-93, and Tyr-123. The carboxylate of residue Glu-90 appears to be crucial for charge complementation of the positively charged ethyl ammonium group of R6G, and residues Thr-89 and Gln-96 make other nondiscriminating contacts to polar groups of the drug. The key aromatic residues of the Et pocket are Tyr-103 and Tyr-123, and Phe-162′ (from the other subunit). The positive charge of ethidium is complemented by the carboxylate of residue Glu-120. Residues Ile-199, Ile-100, and Gln-96 are also part of the Et-binding pocket. Thus, residues Tyr-123 and Gln-96 belong to both drug-binding pockets. The structures of QacR bound to malachite green and crystal violet revealed these monovalent cationic drugs bound between the RG6 and the Et pockets (contacting residues of each site), whereas berberine was bound in the R6G site but used the carboxylates of residues Glu-57 and Glu-58 to neutralize its positive charge (14Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Google Scholar). Dequalinium, which contains two positively charged aromatic quinolinium rings that are linked by a flexible 10-methylene carbon chain (Fig. 2A), was found to span both pockets. As observed for berberine, dequalinium does not use the Glu-90 residue of the R6G pocket to complement the quinolinium ring; rather residues Glu-57 and Glu-58 are involved. However, residues Trp-61 and Tyr-93 are still used in stacking interactions. Whether other bivalent cationic compounds of similar size, shape, and flexibility utilize both, one, or neither subsite is unknown. Pentamidine and hexamidine, which feature these chemical characteristics, have been shown to be inducers of QacR in vivo as well as substrates of QacA in vivo and thus were selected for structural studies to address this issue (7Mitchell B.A. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 475-477Google Scholar). The structures of these QacR-diamidine complexes revealed that pentamidine and hexamidine, which differ by only a single methylene carbon in their linkers, evoked the identical coil-to-helix transition that is necessary for induction yet have very different binding modes. Although the hexamidine binding was different from the pentamidine binding, the former (longer) diamidine bound to QacR in a manner similar to dequalinium. Pentamidine, on the other hand, defines novel QacR drug-binding determinants, and the structure of the complex revealed that a formal negatively charged residue was not necessary to complement the positive charge of one of the benzamidine moieties. Thus, these structures reinforce and expand upon the idea of the plastic multidrug-binding pocket with a number of shared subsites that accommodate a large number of chemically and structurally dissimilar compounds. Preparation and Crystallization of the QacR-Drug Complexes—A recombinant plasmid containing the qacR gene, in which both native cysteines are mutated (C72A, C141S) and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag is added, was used in this work (10Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Roberts N.J. Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18665-18673Google Scholar, 12Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Skurray R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7102-7109Google Scholar). The protein was overexpressed in the Escherichia coli strain DH5α and purified from cell lysates by the use of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as reported previously (10Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Roberts N.J. Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18665-18673Google Scholar, 12Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Skurray R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7102-7109Google Scholar). Purified protein was subjected to reductive alkylation of the lysines, which allows the reproducible crystallization of QacR-drug complexes (14Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Google Scholar, 15Rayment I. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 171-179Google Scholar). The reductive alkylation was terminated by the addition of 200 mm glycine. The resulting alkylated protein was concentrated to 10-15 mg/ml, during which the protein was buffered with a solution containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm imidazole, 300 mm sodium chloride, and 5% glycerol. Reductive alkylation of the protein has been demonstrated to have no detrimental effect on drug binding (14Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Google Scholar). The QacR-pentamidine and QacR-hexamidine complexes were crystallized at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The 8-μl drops contained equal aliquots of the protein-drug solution and reservoir buffer (2.95-2.85 m ammonium sulfate and 50-150 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6). The protein-drug solution was produced by adding a small amount of solid drug into the protein solution and incubating for several hours at 4 °C followed by brief centrifugation of the solution to remove excess solid drug. Hexamidine was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI, National Institutes of Health. Pentamidine isethionate was purchased from Sigma. After ∼2 weeks, crystals with dimensions of 0.4 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm were obtained. X-ray Intensity Data Collection, Processing, and Structure Refinement—X-ray intensity data were collected at 100 K using beamline 9-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The crystals were cryoprotected with a solution of 1.6 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, and 20% glycerol. X-ray intensity data were processed with MOSFLM and merged using SCALA (16Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsl. Protein Crystallogr. 1992; 26Google Scholar, 17Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). The QacR-drug crystals assumed space group P42212 with unit cell dimensions that were isomorphous to all previously determined QacR-drug complexes (Table I). Two dimers of QacR were found in the asymmetric unit, one of which contained the drug in only one subunit of the dimer. The other dimer was drug-free (14Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G.

Open table in a new tab The structures of the QacR-hexamidine and QacR-pentamidine complexes were solved by difference Fourier methods using the previously determined QacR-dequalinium structure with the drug and solvent removed as the starting model. Pentamidine and hexamidine (Fig. 2A) were constructed with ISIS Draw, and the crystallography NMR software topology and parameter files were obtained using the HIC-Up server (18Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Google Scholar). Refinement of both structures was carried out using crystallography NMR software with one initial round of rigid body refinement followed by a round of simulated annealing (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Subsequent rounds of positional and thermal parameter refinement were carried out with each followed by model rebuilding using 2FO - FC and FO - FC electron density maps for guidance and the software package O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Water and sulfate molecules were added to each structure using the overlapping electron density criteria: FO - FC > 3.0 σ and 2FO - FC > 1.0 σ. The final model was verified by inspection of the simulated annealing composite omit maps and FO - FC difference electron density (Fig. 2, B and C). The final Rwork and Rfree are listed in Table I for each QacR-drug complex. Ramachandran plot analysis was performed using the RAMPAGE server and revealed excellent stereochemistry (Table I) (21Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall III, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 437-450Google Scholar). The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 1RKW (QacR-pentamidine) and 1RPW (QacR-hexamidine). Structure of the QacR-Hexamidine Complex—The structure of the QacR-hexamidine complex was determined by difference Fourier methods and refined to 2.90 Å resolution. The final Rwork was 22.9%, and Rfree was 28.0%. The structure revealed that hexamidine binds to QacR in a manner similar to dequalinium in that the drug was fully elongated, thus allowing the benzamidine groups to reach into the R6G and Et drug-binding pockets (Fig. 3). This may not appear too surprising given the similar end-to-end lengths of dequalinium (19.0 Å) and hexamidine (20.6 Å). However, the details of their binding modes are different. As seen in the QacR-dequalinium structure, the positively charged ends of hexamidine were neutralized by the carboxylates of residues Glu-57 of the R6G pocket and Glu-120 of the Et pocket (Fig. 3). However, unlike dequalinium, the binding residue Glu-58 was not involved, as its carboxylate pointed away from the drug. Multiple QacR-hexamidine stacking interactions were found and involved R6G-binding pocket residues Trp-61 and Tyr-93 at one end of the symmetric hexamidine molecule and Et-binding pocket residues Tyr-123 and Phe-162′ (from the other subunit) at the other end of the drug (Table II). The aliphatic side chain of Ile-124 was also within van der Waals distance of the aliphatic portion of hexamidine nearest the R6G pocket. Multiple polar contacts were observed between QacR and the drug. Within the R6G pocket, Gln-64 contacted one end of the drug while in the Et pocket Asn-117, Asn-154, Asn-157 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Phe-162′ contacted the other benzamidine moiety (Table II). In addition to these direct contacts, several water molecules were found in the drug-binding pocket that served in water-mediated protein-drug interactions. Water molecule W1 linked one of the hexamidine ether oxygens to the amide nitrogen of Asn-157. W4 contacted the nitrogen of the amidine group outside the Et pocket and connected it to Asn-154 and water molecule W5, which in turn formed hydrogen bonds to residues Asn-117, Glu-165′, and Gln-166′.Table IIQacR-drug contactsPentamidine Site 1Pentamidine Site 2Hexamidine Et siteaElectron density of the diamidine group at this site is weak, and the contact distances are best estimates.Hexamidine R6G siteQacR residueDistanceQacR residueDistanceQacR residueDistanceQacR residueDistanceÅÅÅÅTrp-613.9Lys-60 (O)b(O) designates contacts involving the polypeptide carbonyl oxygen atom.4.8Asn-1174.5Glu-574.2Tyr-823.2Glu-634.5Glu-1202.6Trp-613.6Ser-863.6Gln-643.8Tyr-1234.4Gln-643.2Gln-965.0Tyr-933.8Ile-1243.3Tyr-933.8Tyr-1234.7Water3.9Asn-1543.1Tyr-1272.8Asn-1574.1Ala-153 (O)3.0Tyr-162 (O)cResidues from the drug-free subunit of the QacR dimer.2.9Asn-1573.6Tyr-162cResidues from the drug-free subunit of the QacR dimer.4.9a Electron density of the diamidine group at this site is weak, and the contact distances are best estimates.b (O) designates contacts involving the polypeptide carbonyl oxygen atom.c Residues from the drug-free subunit of the QacR dimer. Open table in a new tab Structure of the QacR-Pentamidine Complex—The structure of the QacR-pentamidine complex, also determined by difference Fourier methods, was refined to 2.62 Å resolution resulting in an Rwork of 22.3% and an Rfree of 27.7%. The crystal structure of the QacR-pentamidine complex revealed that pentamidine, which differs from hexamidine by only a single methylene group, bound very differently to QacR when compared with hexamidine and dequalinium (Figs. 4, 5, 6). Unlike hexamidine and dequalinium, the pentamidine molecule was significantly twisted about its central linker, and as a result, the end-to-end length of the molecule was only 17.1 Å. In this conformation, pentamidine did not span the drug-binding pocket but rather bent into the core of the protein. In doing so, a novel drug-binding pocket was created (Table II). At one end of the pentamidine-binding site (designated as Site 2), the benzamidine moiety stacked with Tyr-93, the aromatic residue, which in part defined the R6G pocket (14Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Google Scholar). However, none of the other stacking residues of the canonical R6G pocket interacted with this end of the pentamidine molecule. Moreover, acidic residue Glu-63 (and not Glu57, Glu58, or Glu90) interacted with the positively charged benzamidine moiety. This was the first time that residue Glu-63 had been observed to play a primary role (i.e. that of charge neutralization) in drug binding. In addition, the side chain carbonyl oxygen of residue Gln-64 was also involved in binding.Fig. 5Close up stereoview of the Site 1 drug-binding site of pentamidine.

Although fully buried, there were no glutamates or aspartates within 6.0 Å of this positively charged benzamidine group. Rather, the positive charge of the drug was complemented by interactions with a number of nearby oxygen atoms. The closest drug-protein contacts were made with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of residue Ala-153 and the side chain hydroxyl oxygen atom of residue Tyr-127, both of which engaged in dipole-charge interactions with the amidinic nitrogens. The side chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn-157 and the side chain hydroxyl oxygen of Ser-86 were also within proximity of the benzamidine moiety and contributed to the overall negative electrostatic character of Site 1 (Table II, Fig. 5). An energetically favorable π-cation stacking interaction was made between the aromatic side chain of residue Tyr-82 and one side of the benzamidine group (22Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Google Scholar, 23Tsuzuki S. Honda K. Uchimaru T. Mikami M. Tanabe K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 11450-11458Google Scholar). Additional stacking interactions took place between the aromatic side chains of residues Trp-61 and Tyr-23 and one side of the benzamidine phenyl group. Interestingly, residue Trp-61 is one of the key residues that defines the R6G-binding pocket, whereas residue Tyr-123 contributes to the R6G and Et pockets (14Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Google Scholar). As observed in all QacR-drug complexes, several solvent molecules were also found in the pentamidine-binding pocket but only near Site 1 (Fig. 4). Two of these water molecules contributed to a protein-water-drug interaction network whereby residue Tyr-93 of Site 2 is linked to Site 1 residue Tyr-123 by W1 (Fig. 4). Further, W1 hydrogen bound to W2, which also hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl group of residue Tyr-123 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of residue Leu-54. Thus, the solvent found near Site 1 serves to buttress the positions of key drug-binding side chains but clearly do not play a role in ligand specificity. The multidrug-binding transcription repressor QacR has an exceptional ability to bind to a broad spectrum of mono- and bivalent cationic lipophilic compounds, which are also substrates of the QacA multidrug transporter (which QacR regulates) (7Mitchell B.A. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 475-477Google Scholar, 8Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 163-170Google Scholar, 9Littlejohn T.G. Paulsen I.T.

Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Google Scholar). This ability is articulated through the multifaceted binding pocket of QacR, which is characterized by the presence of multiple glutamates, myriad aromatic residues, and several polar residues. Aromatic residues are expected to play a key role in drug binding in all multidrug-binding proteins, given their ability to stack with aromatic drugs and be involved in electrostatic interactions with charged drugs (22Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Google Scholar, 23Tsuzuki S. Honda K. Uchimaru T. Mikami M. Tanabe K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 11450-11458Google Scholar, 24Neyfakh A.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1123-1130Google Scholar, 25Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 885-893Google Scholar). Indeed, the crystal structure of the transcription activator, BmrR, with an aromatic monovalent cation (26Zheleznova E.E. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1999; 96: 353-362Google Scholar, 27Zheleznova-Heldwein E.E. Brennan R.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 378-382Google Scholar) and the recent moderate-resolution crystal structures of four drugs bound to the bacterial multidrug transporter AcrB, also showed the importance of such interactions (28Yu E.W. McDermott G. Zgruskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 2003; 300: 976-980Google Scholar, 29Yu E.W. Aires J.R. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5657-5664Google Scholar). The structures of the odorant-binding protein, a polyspecific multiligand-binding protein, in complex with multiple small nonpolar and aromatic compounds also demonstrate a central role for aromatic residues in ligand binding (30Tegoni M. Pelosi P. Vincent F. Spinelle S. Campanacci V. Grolli S. Ramoni R. Cambillau C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 229-240Google Scholar, 31Vincent F. Spinelli. S. Ramoni R. Grolli S. Pelosi P. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 127-139Google Scholar). The structures of the QacR-hexamidine and QacR-pentamidine complexes were only the second and third examples of bivalent cationic drug binding to this multidrug-binding protein. Hexamidine, similar to dequalinium, maintained an elongated conformation and thus readily spanned the RG6- and Et-binding pockets of QacR (Figs. 3 and 6). Similar to dequalinium, the two positive charges of the individual benzamidine groups were neutralized by the carboxylates of residues Glu-57 and Glu-120. However, there were differences in their binding mechanisms. Whereas the positions of the quinolinium ring of dequalinium and the benzamidine group of hexamidine in the R6G subsite were very similar, their locations in the Et-binding pocket were quite different, whereby the aromatic benzamidine group was found closer to helix α7 and about a turn of helix nearer the carboxyl terminus of that helix (Fig. 6). Despite their somewhat different locations, many of the protein-drug contacts were the same, such that the carboxylate of residue Glu-120 served to neutralize the positive charge of each drug, and the phenyl ring of Phe-162′ stacked with their aromatic rings. Regardless, the somewhat different binding modes of two compounds of similar end-to-end length and identical charge highlighted the plasticity of the multidrug-binding pocket of QacR. The plasticity and promiscuity of the multidrug-binding pocket were further underscored by the structure of the QacR-pentamidine complex, in which an entirely novel manner of drug binding was observed (Figs. 4, 5, 6). Pentamidine was the first example of a drug that utilized neither the R6G nor Et subsites to bind QacR. Indeed the positive charge on the aromatic benzamidine group that was closest to the R6G site, which was designated Site 2 for pentamidine, was then neutralized by the carboxylate side chain of residue Glu-63. This marked the first time this acidic residue had carried out this function and added yet another QacR glutamate residue that was involved in drug binding, with the others being Glu-57, Glu-58, Glu-90, and Glu-120. More striking was the finding that the positive charge of the other aromatic benzamidine moiety, which was bound in Site 1, did not interact with the carboxylate of any acidic residue (Fig. 5). Rather, electrostatic neutralization was accomplished by drug interactions with the negative dipoles of several oxygen atoms from nearby side chains and the peptide backbone. A similar charge neutralization mechanism is readily envisioned for other multidrug-binding proteins including the transporters. For example, the structures of the AcrB-drug complexes, with the exception of AcrB-dequalinium, do not reveal any acidic residues within 6 Å of the bound positively charged cytotoxins, and hence their charge neutralization/complementarity is unclear (28Yu E.W. McDermott G. Zgruskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 2003; 300: 976-980Google Scholar). Perhaps several side chain or peptide backbone oxygens are proximal to the charge and thus carry out this function. That tyrosinyl hydroxyl oxygens can “neutralize” a buried charge is seen in the crystal structure of the multidrug-binding domain of BmrR (26Zheleznova E.E. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1999; 96: 353-362Google Scholar). Moreover, peptide backbone carbonyl oxygens are particularly well suited to complement a formal positive charge as exemplified by the mechanism of potassium binding by the potassium channel (32Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Google Scholar). In conclusion, the ability of QacR to bind two very similar aromatic diamidines in quite different ways underscored the plasticity of its multidrug-binding pocket and very likely those of other multidrug-binding proteins. Moreover, neutralization of the positive charge(s) of cationic drugs did not require the presence of proximal acidic residues but was affected by the electronegative dipoles of nearby oxygens. Thus, another layer of complexity is added to the binding pockets of multidrug-binding proteins, and any de novo structure-based efforts to design high affinity inhibitors of multidrug-binding proteins become yet more difficult."
https://openalex.org/W1995294810,"The amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) controls Na+ transport into cells and across epithelia. So far, four homologous subunits of mammalian ENaC have been isolated and are denoted as α, β, γ, and δ. ENaCδ can associate with β and γ subunits and generate a constitutive current that is 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of homomeric ENaCδ. However, the distribution pattern of ENaCδ is not consistent with that of the β and γ subunits. ENaCδ is expressed mainly in the brain in contrast to β and γ subunits, which are expressed in non-neuronal tissues. To explain this discrepancy, we searched for novel functional properties of homomeric ENaCδ and investigated the detailed tissue distribution in humans. When human ENaCδ was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells, a reduction of extracellular pH activated this channel (half-maximal pH for an activation of 5.0), and the acid-induced current was abolished by amiloride. The most striking finding was that the desensitization of the acid-evoked current was much slower (by ∼10% 120 s later), dissociating from the kinetics of acid-sensing ion channels in the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel family, which were rapidly desensitized during acidification. RNA dot-blot analyses showed that ENaCδ mRNA was widely distributed throughout the brain and was also expressed in the heart, kidney, and pancreas in humans. Northern blotting confirmed that ENaCδ was expressed in the cerebellum and the hippocampus. In conclusion, human ENaCδ activity is regulated by protons, indicating that it may contribute to the pH sensation and/or pH regulation in the human brain.

The δ subunit of ENaC was originally described as mainly being expressed in the human brain (5Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). ENaCδ can associate with β and γ subunits to form a heteromeric channel because the coexpression of these three subunits increases the Na+ current (5Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution pattern of ENaCδ, however, is quite different from that of β and γ subunits. ENaCδ is expressed mainly in the brain, pancreas, testis, and ovary (5Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), whereas β and γ subunits are expressed mainly in the kidney, lung, and colon (3Canessa C.M. Schild L.

Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the expressed sequence tag data base shows that an ENaCδ gene has been found in humans and chimpanzees (GenBank™ accession numbers U38254 and O46547, respectively), but for now, there is no evidence for the orthologues in rats and mice. This suggests that ENaCδ associates with unknown subunits or that homomeric ENaCδ has its own unknown physiological function in humans. Our goal was to identify the novel functional properties of human ENaCδ (hENaCδ) using electrophysiological techniques and to investigate the more detailed tissue distribution of ENaCδ in humans by Northern blot and RNA dot-blot analyses. Here we describe how ENaCδ is expressed widely in the human brain, such as in the cerebellum and hippocampus, and how the channel activity is enhanced by external protons in both Xenopus oocyte and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cell expression systems. These results provide the novel profile that ENaCδ responds to acidification in humans. Molecular Biology—All experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences and were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Two expressed sequence tag clones (GenBank™ accession numbers BI520370 and AI199647) were obtained from the Medical Research Council Geneservice (Babraham, UK) to prepare a full-length hENaCδ containing a 1,914-nucleotide open reading frame. Rat acid-sensing ion channel 2a (rASIC2a; U53211) was isolated as described previously (6Ugawa S. Minami Y. Guo W. Saishin Y. Takatsuji K. Yamamoto T. Tohyama M. Shimada S. Nature. 1998; 395: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Xenopus Oocyte Electrophysiology—The coding sequence of hENaCδ or rASIC2a was subcloned into a pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of Xenopus β-globin added at the multicloning site to promote stable mRNA expression in Xenopus oocytes. Using an mMESSAGE mMACHINE T3 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), cRNAs were synthesized and 5 ng was injected into Xenopus oocytes. The control oocytes were injected with an equal volume of diethyl dicarbonate-treated water and are described as native oocytes throughout. Electrophysiological recordings were taken 48–72 h after injection using a two-electrode voltage clamp technique with a CEZ-1200 amplifier (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) and a MacLab A/D converter (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO). The recording solution had an ionic composition of 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH. The recording solution for pH experiments was prepared with the equivalent MES (pKa = 6.15) instead of HEPES (pKa = 7.55) and adjusted to a suitable pH with either NaOH or HCl. The recording chamber was continuously perfused with solution at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. All electrophysiological experiments were carried out at room temperature (24 ± 1 °C). CHO-K1 Cell Electrophysiology—The coding sequence of hENaCδ was subcloned in a pTracer-CMV2 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transiently transfected into CHO-K1 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The control cells were transfected with the vector alone, described as native cells throughout. Experiments were carried out 48–72 h later using the whole-cell patch clamp technique with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pCLAMP 8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The transiently transfected cells were identified from green fluorescence protein expression. The extracellular solution had an ionic composition of 137 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 14 mm glucose, and 10 mm MES. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MES, 2 mm Na2ATP, and 5 mm EGTA. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. RNA Dot-Blot—A human multiple tissue expression array (version 2) was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). A 32P-labeled hENaCδ probe was prepared from the full-length hENaCδ cDNA fragment using a Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (-dCTP) kit (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was prehybridized in a modified Church's buffer (0.5 m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 10 mm EDTA, and 7% SDS) for 6 h at 65 °C and then hybridized in a buffer containing 1.5 × 106 cpm/ml of a 32P-labeled probe for 12 h at 65 °C. After hybridization, the membrane was repeatedly washed in 2× SSC and 1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C followed by two additional washes with a solution containing 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS for 20 min at 55 °C, and exposed to Kodak X-AR film for 1 week at -80 °C. Northern Blot—Human samples free from neurological disorders were taken within 24 h after death with permission of the deceased persons' families. (Ethical principles and considerations were observed regarding forensic and related research using human organs and fluids obtained from autopsies.) Human cerebellums and hippocampi were rapidly frozen on dry ice immediately after their removal at autopsy and were kept at -80 °C until use. From freshly frozen tissues, 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNAs were obtained using a FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). The membrane was prehybridized in a hybridization buffer (5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 20 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1% SDS) for 6 h at 42 °C and hybridized in a buffer containing 2.0 × 106 cpm/ml of the 32P-labeled hENaCδ probe for 12 h at 42 °C. After hybridization, the membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC at room temperature followed by two additional washes with a solution containing 1× SSC and 0.4% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C, rinsed in 2× SSC at room temperature, and exposed to film for 1 week at -80 °C. Statistics—Pooled data are shown as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between the two groups and among groups was determined by Student's t test and Scheffé's test after one way analysis of variance, respectively. Significant difference is expressed in the figures (*, p < 0.05; ** or ##, p < 0.01). The data on the relationships between proton concentrations and current responses were fitted using the following equation (see Fig. 2B): IpH = Imax/{1+(Kd/[H+]o)n} + C, where Imax is the maximum amplitude of the acid-evoked current, Kd is the apparent dissociation constant of protons, [H+]o is the concentration of extracellular protons, n is the Hill coefficient, and C is the constant. Characterization of hENaCδ Current in Xenopus Oocytes— When hENaCδ was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, an inward current was induced at a holding potential of -60 mV, and the current was mostly inhibited by 100 μm amiloride (Fig. 1A). The mean amplitude of the amiloride-sensitive current in hENaCδ-expressed oocytes was 160 ± 9 nA at -60 mV (n = 27, p < 0.01 versus native of 4 ± 1 nA, n = 22). The macroscopic properties of the hENaCδ current in our experimental system were similar to those reported previously (5Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It has been reported that hENaCδ itself can induce some currents when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, but the heteromultimeric channel with β and γ subunits produces a larger current (5Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), as is the case with ENaCα (3Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 4McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike ENaCα, which plays a pathophysiological role as an ENaCαβγ complex in epithelia such as the kidney, lung, and colon (3Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 4McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J.

Physiol. 2000; 62: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether ENaCδ associates with other subunits in vivo to play a role in physiological functions. It has been reported that ENaCδ is expressed mainly in the brain, pancreas, testis, and ovary (5Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), whereas β and γ subunits are expressed mainly in the kidney, lung, and colon (3Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 4McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we focused on homomeric hENaCδ in this study. Proton Activation of hENaCδ Current in Xenopus Oocytes— Interestingly, the activity of hENaCδ showed pH dependence in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. At a holding potential of -60 mV, the application of pH 5.0 induced an inward current in hENaCδ-injected oocytes (514 ± 41 nA, n = 17, p < 0.01 versus native of 62 ± 4 nA, n = 10; Fig. 1, B and C). The current-voltage relationship showed that the acidic pH stimuli enhanced the channel activity at all voltages examined in hENaCδ oocytes. The addition of 100 μm amiloride dramatically blocked the acid-evoked current (87 ± 2% decrease, n = 17, p < 0.01) and, moreover, significantly inhibited the current (to 62 ± 8 nA, n = 17, p < 0.01 versus the initial resting current of 175 ± 6 nA). During a sustained acidic pulse at pH 5.0, there was a slight decline in the amplitude of the acid-evoked current in hENaCδ oocytes (6 ± 1% decrease at 120 s, n = 17). In sharp contrast, rASIC2a was activated by extracellular acidification and rapidly desensitized even as the pH remained steady (90 ± 1% reduction, n = 3; Fig. 1, D and E). The activity of the acid-induced hENaCδ current was constitutive in the presence of an acidic medium, with clear distinction from the major properties of acid-sensitive degenerin/epithelial Na+ channels such as rASIC2a expressed in the brain (9Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7879-7882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 10Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), which was rapidly activated by protons and desensitized even during acidic pH (Fig. 1, D and E, and Refs. 6Ugawa S. Minami Y. Guo W. Saishin Y. Takatsuji K. Yamamoto T. Tohyama M. Shimada S. Nature. 1998; 395: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 10Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin.

Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2141-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The kinetics of desensitization during acidification on ASIC1a and ASIC2a are faster; the pH 6.0-evoked ASIC1a current is desensitized to the resting level within 30 s (12Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 13Sutherland S.P. Benson C.J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and the pH 5.0-induced ASIC2a current is reduced to ∼30% of peak amplitude within 30 s (9Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7879-7882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 11Ugawa S. Ueda T. Minami Y. Horimoto M. Shimada S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15418-15422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). On the other hand, pH-sensitive ASIC3 current possesses unique biphasic kinetics or a transient larger current followed by a sustained current of smaller amplitude (13Sutherland S.P. Benson C.J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 15Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The desensitization of the acid-evoked hENaCδ current was much slower than that of ASICs, and no significant desensitization was observed during acidification on an acid-elicited hENaCδ current. In hENaCδ-expressed oocytes, the gradual decrease in pH from 7.5 to 3.0 showed that the hENaCδ current was increased by acidic pH below 6.5 in a proton concentration-dependent manner (704 ± 75 nA at pH 3.0, n = 13, p < 0.01) and was mostly saturated at pH 4.0 (Fig. 2). The half-maximal pH for activation of the hENaCδ current was 5.0, and the Hill coefficient was 0.6. The proton-induced currents were from the hENaCδ channel because in control oocytes minimal acid-evoked currents were observed at lower than pH 4.0 (122 ± 56 nA at pH 3.0, n = 7) and the currents were insensitive to 100 μm amiloride (n = 5). Acid-evoked hENaCδ Currents in CHO-K1 Cells—Further evidence for the acid-evoked activation of hENaCδ was provided by whole-cell voltage clamp studies of CHO-K1 cells transiently expressing hENaCδ (Fig. 3). At a holding potential of -60 mV, 100 μm amiloride-sensitive inward currents were observed in hENaCδ-transfected cells (193 ± 15 pA, n = 9, p < 0.01 versus native) but not in native cells (6 ± 2 pA, n = 9). Extracellular acidification induced larger amiloride-sensitive currents in an acidic pH-dependent manner in hENaCδ cells (504 ± 58 pA at pH 5.0, n = 9, p < 0.01) than any observed in native cells (47 ± 10 pA, n = 9). The pH response profile in CHO-K1 cells was very similar to that obtained in the oocytes. Although both ENaC and ASIC families belong to the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel superfamily, the functional properties of ENaCs have been thought to differ from those of ASICs. ENaCs are constitutively active channels, whereas ASICs require acidic stimulation for activation (7Alvarez de la Rosa D. Canessa C.M. Fyfe G.K. Zhang P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 8Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 10Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The members of the ASIC family have been implicated as transducers of pH stimuli because these channels are activated by acidification in an extracellular compartment (8Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 10Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The profile of pH responsiveness on ASICs varies with these channels (8Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 10Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar); the half-maximal pH values for the activation of heterologously expressed ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC3 are 6.2–6.4 (12Waldmann R.

In this investigation, using two different expression systems, we found that the activity of hENaCδ was clearly enhanced by extracellular acidification and the response was influenced by amiloride. Expression of ENaCδ in Human Tissues—The ENaCδ distribution was analyzed using a human RNA dot-blot array. The RNA dot-blot analyses demonstrated that ENaCδ mRNAs were widely expressed in various human brain regions such as the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and putamen (Fig. 4A). Moreover, strong blotting signals were also found in the heart, kidney, and pancreas as well as in the fetal brain, heart, and kidney. Next we performed Northern blot analyses (Fig. 4B) using the poly(A)+ RNAs obtained from freshly frozen human cerebellum and hippocampus, where an intense signal was shown among brain in RNA dot-blot analysis. The expression of ∼5.5-kb mRNA was observed in the cerebellum. Moreover, a faint signal of ∼5.5 kb was detected in the hippocampus. Both RNA dot-blot and Northern blot analyses showed that ENaCδ mRNA was expressed in human brain tissue such as the cerebellum and hippocampus. Neuronal activity is well known to be associated with pH fluctuations (19Chesler M. Kaila K. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 396-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In this investigation, hENaCδ started to open at pH 6.5 and induced larger amiloride-sensitive currents with more acidic pH. More recently, ASIC1a in the central nervous system has been implicated in long term potentiation, suggesting that minute fluxes in synaptic pH may activate ASICs to enhance synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (20Bianchi L.

Preliminary experiments into acquiring an ENaCδ clone from the neuronal tissues of other mammals, such as rats and mice, were unsuccessful. A further search of the expressed sequence tag data base showed that not even a partial fragment of ENaCδ has been found yet except for in humans and chimpanzees (GenBank™ accession numbers U38254 and O46547, respectively). Nevertheless, other ENaC subunits (α, β, and γ) have been isolated not only from mammals but also from amphibians and birds. The corresponding genomic assignments of ENaCδ were identified on human chromosome 1p36.3-p36.2 (22Waldmann R. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Mattei M. Genomics. 1996; 34: 262-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). ENaCδ may be a unique gene constructed on the genome of only primates in the process of evolution. In this investigation, we found that hENaCδ was abundantly expressed throughout the human brain, such as in the cerebellum and hippocampus, and the channel activity was constitutively enhanced at a pH lower than 6.5 in a pH-dependent manner when expressed in Xenopus oocytes and CHO-K1 cells. Taken together, these data suggest a possible role for ENaCδ as a key component of proton-activated currents in the human brain. We thank Katsuyuki Tanaka and Kenji Kajita for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1989743013,"Activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) signal transduction cascade by RAS mutations has been found in a variety of human cancers. Mutations of BRAF provide an alternative route for activation of this signalling pathway. To determine the role of mutations in BRAF and KRAS2 in the neoplastic progression of Barrett's adenocarcinoma, we analysed both genes for common mutations. After microdissection, DNA of 19 Barrett's adenocarcinomas, 56 Barrett's intraepithelial neoplasias (n=29 low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN) and n=27 high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN)), 30 Barrett's mucosa without neoplasia and normal squamous, as well as gastric epithelium, were analysed for BRAF and KRAS2 mutation. Activating BRAF mutations were identified in 2/19 Barrett's adenocarcinomas (11%) and in 1/27 HGIN (4%). KRAS2 mutations were found in four out of 19 (21%) Barrett's adenocarcinomas examined and in three cases of HGIN (11%). In LGIN as well as in normal gastric or oesophageal mucosa, neither BRAF nor KRAS2 mutations were detected. All lesions with KRAS2 mutations had an intact BRAF gene. The status of mismatch-repair proteins was neither related to BRAF nor KRAS2 mutations. These data indicate that RAS or BRAF mutations are detected in about 32% of all Barrett's adenocarcinomas. We conclude that the disruption of the Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) kinase pathway is a frequent but also early event in the development of Barrett's adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2038957182,"The ability of androgens to inhibit apoptosis in both normal and malignant prostatic cells has been well documented. However, the underlying mechanisms are understood poorly. Here we demonstrated that forkhead transcription factor FKHR (FOXO1)-induced death of LNCaP cells was blocked by a synthetic androgen R1881. Androgen treatment also resulted in a reduction in transcriptional activity of FKHR in these cells. Moreover, treatment of LNCaP cells with R1881 led to a decrease in the intact FKHR protein (70 kDa) and an increase in a faster migrating protein band (60 kDa). Androgen-enhanced appearance of the 60-kDa protein was diminished specifically by lysosomal acidic cysteine protease inhibitors. Mass spectrometry analyses of the purified FLAG-tagged 70- and 60-kDa proteins demonstrated that the 60-kDa species is a FKHR protein product that lacks about 120 amino acid residues of the C-terminal end. Mutagenesis of the basic amino acid Arg537 in the protease cleavage region, as suggested by mass spectrometry, abrogated both the androgen-induced accumulation of the 60-kDa product and decrease in cell death induced by FKHR, suggesting that the residue Arg537 is a potential protease cleavage site. Finally, ectopic expression of the first 537 amino acids of FKHR produced an inhibitory effect on transcriptional activity of the intact protein. Together, these results suggest that androgens induce increased activity of an acidic cysteine protease, which in turn cleaves FKHR. This provides a mechanism by which androgens protect prostate cancer cells from the killing effect of FKHR.

The tumor suppressor gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten; also known as MMAC1/TEP1) is mutated frequently in a variety of tumors including prostate, brain, and endometrium (7Li J.

Although the overall prevalence of PTEN mutations in primary prostate cancer is low relative to other tumors (10Ali I.U. Schriml L.M. Dean M. J. Natl.

PTEN acts as a tumor suppressor protein primarily via its phosphatidylinositol phosphatase activity, which antagonizes the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (19Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Loss of PTEN in prostate cancer cells results in the constitutive activation of the oncoprotein Akt. Moreover, restoration of PTEN expression in PTEN-mutated prostate cancer cell lines abolishes the activation of Akt and subsequently induces cell death (12Huang H. Cheville J.C. Pan Y. Roche P.C.

Phosphorylated forkhead proteins remain inactive in the cytoplasm. The forkhead proteins undergo dephosphorylation due to the inhibition of Akt activity by factors such as PTEN or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors. Activated forkhead proteins translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and subsequently bind to promoters of their target genes (27Nakae J. Barr V. Accili D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 989-996Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that FOXO forkhead transcription factors may play important roles in regulating many cellular functions including proliferation, cell survival, and DNA damage. The members of this family regulate G1 cell cycle progression by modulating expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 and D type cyclins (23Nakamura N. Ramaswamy S. Vazquez F. Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Google Scholar, 28Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Google Scholar, 29Ramaswamy S.

They also mediate transition from M to G1 of the cell cycle by directly regulating expression of mitotic genes such as cyclin B and polo-like kinase (plk) (30Alvarez B. Martinez A.C. Burgering B.M. Carrera A.C. Nature. 2001; 413: 744-747Google Scholar). Forkhead transcription factors affect the expression of several other genes that are involved in the cell cycle including Wip1, EXT1, and cyclin G2 (31Tran H. Brunet A. Grenier J.M. Datta S.R.

Expression of scavenger proteins such as cytosolic catalase and superoxide dismutase and the DNA damage response gene gadd45 are regulated by FOXO forkhead transcription factors, suggesting that these proteins play a role in surveillance of DNA damage (31Tran H.

Foxo3a (FKHRL1) knockout female mice exhibit a distinctive ovarian phenotype of global follicular activation leading to oocyte death (39Castrillon D.H. Miao L. Kollipara R. Horner J.W. DePinho R.A.

Vazquez F. Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Google Scholar, 35Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of FKHR function may be a critical factor for survival of prostate cancer cells. Our laboratory and others have shown previously that androgens act as survival factors by antagonizing PTEN activity in LNCaP cells (40Murillo H. Huang H. Schmidt L.J. Smith D.I. Tindall D.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4795-4805Google Scholar, 41Li P. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20444-20450Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that the FKHR-induced decrease in cell viability and increase in cell death is blocked by androgen treatment, which is concomitant with inhibition of transactivation of FKHR in androgen-treated cells. We further provide evidence that the inhibitory effect of androgens on FKHR is mediated primarily through a proteolytic mechanism. Materials—N-terminal FLAG-tagged pcDNA3 expression plasmids for wild-type FKHR, FKHR(WT), a constitutively active form, FKHR(AAA), and the luciferase reporter construct 3×IRS-Luc were kindly provided by Drs.

The substitution mutants R537G, R554G, K559G, and P538G were constructed by PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene). Two truncation mutants WT(Δ) and AAA(Δ) were constructed from FKHR(WT) and FKHR(AAA), respectively, by deleting a C-terminal fragment after the residue Arg537. These mutations were verified by sequencing. Construction of the mammalian expression vector for PTEN has been described previously (12Huang H. Cheville J.C. Pan Y. Roche P.C. Schmidt L.J.

A polyclonal antibody against FKHR was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). A monoclonal antibody against PTEN (6H2.1) was purchased from Cascade BioScience (Winchester, MA). Erk2 (D-2) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against α-FLAG were purchased from Sigma. R1881 (DuPont), bicalutamide (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals), and cycloheximide (Sigma) were dissolved in ethanol. LY294002 (Calbiochem), MG132 (Calbiochem), lactacystin (Calbiochem), and ALLnL (Sigma) were prepared in Me2SO (Sigma). Chloroquine (Sigma), ammonium chloride (Sigma), leupeptin (Sigma), and EGTA (Sigma) were prepared in water. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (Sigma). Cell Lines and Cell Culture—The prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. In the experiments where LNCaP cells were treated with the synthetic androgen R1881 and/or the anti-androgen bicalutamide, these chemicals were refreshed every 48 h. The immortalized prostatic epithelial cell line BPH-1 was kindly provided by Dr. S. W. Hayward (43Hayward S.W. Dahiya R. Cunha G.R. Bartek J. Deshpande N. Narayan P. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1995; 31: 14-24Google Scholar) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Cell Transfections—Transient transfection of LNCaP cells was performed by electroporation as described previously (12Huang H. Cheville J.C. Pan Y. Roche P.C. Schmidt L.J. Tindall D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38830-38836Google Scholar). Cells were mixed with DNA in 400 μl of RPMI 1640 medium. The DNA/cell mixture was transferred into a 4-mm cuvette (BTX Inc., San Diego, CA) and electroporated with a 305-V/10-ms pulse using a BTX T820 square wave electroporator (BTX Inc., San Diego, CA). Transfection efficiency was monitored 12 h after transfection with green fluorescent protein (GFP) 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcriptase; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AR, androgen receptor; MS, mass spectrometry. by examining aliquots of cells under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope with a wavelength of 488 nm. Transfection efficiency was determined by the percentage of the green cells in the whole cell population. Routinely, transfection efficiency met 60–90% was used for experiments. Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were prepared by lysing cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF). Equal amounts of protein (30–80 μg) from cell lysates were denatured in sample buffer, subjected to 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The filters were immunoblotted with specific primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and visualized by enhanced chemilluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells treated with R1881, bicalutamide, or vehicle by TRIzol (Invitrogen). The first-strand cDNAs were synthesized by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen). The forward 5′-AAGAGCGTGCCCTACTTCAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CAGTTCCTGCTGTCAGACAATC-3′ were used for PCR. Samples of 15 μg of total RNA from each treatment were separated on 1.2% denatured formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Bio-Rad). Filters were analyzed for expression of FKHR, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by using an isotope-labeled cDNA fragment of the FKHR coding region or probes as described previously (40Murillo H. Huang H. Schmidt L.J. Smith D.I. Tindall D.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4795-4805Google Scholar, 44Huang H. Reed C.P. Zhang J.S. Shridhar V. Wang L. Smith D.I. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2981-2988Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Assay—LNCaP cells were harvested after transfections, and cell lysates were prepared by adding lysis buffer directly to the cells on ice. Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined using a dual luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Renilla luciferase activities of cells were used as internal controls. Immunofluorescence Chemistry and Confocal Microscopy—For cell viability assays, cells were replated into 6-well plates after transfection. After 12 h, cells were treated with 1 nm R1881 or ethanol for an additional 36 h. Cells were examined under a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal laser microscope. Cells were photographed with a wavelength of 488 nm for GFP. For immunofluorescence chemistry, cells on coverslips (Eppendorf Scientific, Inc., Hamburg, Germany) were washed briefly in 1× PBS and fixed for 20 min in 2% paraformaldehyde (Toussins) in 1× PBS. Cells were permeabilized by incubating with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Cells were washed three times in 1× PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (5% goat serum in 1× PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with a rabbit anti-AR polyclonal antibody (1:500) and a mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with 1× PBS three times for 5 min each, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the following secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) (1:1000) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes) (1:1000) prepared in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed with three changes of 1× PBS for 5 min each and mounted in ProLong (Molecular Probes). Cells were analyzed with a laser-scanning microscope LSM510. Argon ion and HeNe lasers were used to excite fluorescein isothiocyante and Texas Red fluorescence, respectively, and UV laser was used to excite 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cell Death Assay—Nuclear fragment and chromatin condensation were measured as described previously (40Murillo H. Huang H. Schmidt L.J. Smith D.I. Tindall D.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4795-4805Google Scholar). Briefly, cells treated for 48 h after transfections were collected at 4 °C. Supernatant medium was aspirated, and cells were treated with fixative solution (4% formaldehyde in 1× PBS). Bis-benzimide was added at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Cell aliquots were placed on slides and viewed under UV and a wavelength of 488 nm (Carl Zeiss Axiophot). Green cells with signs of chromatin condensation and/or nuclear fragmentation (apoptotic) were scored as dead. Purification of FLAG-tagged FKHR Proteins—LNCaP cells grown in 50 150-mm dishes were transfected with FLAG-tagged FKHR by electroporation. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed once with ice-cold 1× PBS and lysed in Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) plus 1% of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cells were lysated at 4 °C for 30 min. Whole cell lysates were cleared at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Protein samples were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity resins (Sigma) in protein binding buffer (190 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6 mm EDTA, 2.5% Triton X-100) for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) and once with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen), analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and stained with GelCode blue (Pierce) and Western blotting using anti-FKHR antibody (Cell Signaling). In-gel Trypsin Digestion of FLAG-tagged FKHR—The GelCode blue-stained gel bands were destained with 50% acetonitrile, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, for 30 min at room temperature and then reduced with 20 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, for 20 min at 55 °C, followed by alkylation with 40 mm iodoacetamide, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, for 20 min at room temperature. Overnight digestion was performed with trypsin (Promega Corp., Madison WI) in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.1, at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted from the gel bands, first with 2% formic acid followed by 70% acetonitrile, 30% water, 0.1% formic acid. Mass Spectrometry—Liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis of the peptides was performed on a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). The LCQ Deca ion trap was coupled with an Applied Biosystems 140D pump, with a 1:100 split into a New Objective ProteoPep C18 PicoFrit column (75 μm × 5.0 cm) mounted on the New Objective PicoView source (New Objective, Woburn, MA). Peptides were loaded onto a 100-μm × 2.0-cm C18 trap and then eluted and chromatographed with a gradient of 4% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid to 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in 50 min. The LCQ was set to run in data-dependant triple play mode consisting of full scan (400–1900 atomic mass units), zoom scan on most abundant ion, followed by MS/MS mode on that ion. Once a precursor ion was fragmented, it was placed on an exclusion list for 5 min, to avoid repeating tandem MS analysis of the same precursor ion. The MS/MS raw data were converted to DTA files using Bioworks 3.0 and correlated to theoretical fragmentation patterns using the SEQUEST search algorithm with tryptic peptide sequences from the NCBI data base downloaded in February of 2003. Statistics—Statistical analyses were performed by Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant and are presented under “Results.” Androgens Protect LNCaP Cells from Apoptosis Induced by FKHR—Ectopic expression of PTEN in LNCaP cells induces apoptosis, which can be inhibited by androgen treatment (40Murillo H. Huang H. Schmidt L.J. Smith D.I. Tindall D.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4795-4805Google Scholar, 41Li P. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20444-20450Google Scholar). Downstream of PTEN, members of the FOXO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors are critical effectors of cell death, since overexpression of active FKHR mediates death in LNCaP cells (23Nakamura N. Ramaswamy S. Vazquez F. Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Google Scholar). To examine whether androgens affect FKHR-induced death in these cells, we conducted cell viability analyses. In cells without androgen treatment, fewer cells remained viable after being transfected with a constitutively active form of FKHR, FKHR(AAA), in comparison with cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 1, A and B, left panel). However, the killing effect of FKHR(AAA) was inhibited by the treatment of cells with 1 nm of the synthetic androgen R1881 (Fig. 1B, right panel). There was only a slight decease in cell viability when cells were transfected with wild-type FKHR, FKHR(WT) (Fig. 1C, left panel). This confirms a previous report that wild-type FKHR is only partially active because of its phosphorylation state (23Nakamura N. Ramaswamy S. Vazquez F. Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Google Scholar). This slight difference was attenuated following androgen treatment (Fig. 1C, right panel). Co-transfection of FKHR(WT) along with PTEN resulted in a marked decrease in cell viability (Fig. 1D, left panel), which is consistent with the decreased phosphorylation of FKHR and thereby activation of FKHR in cells in the presence of PTEN (23Nakamura N. Ramaswamy S. Vazquez F. Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Google Scholar). This effect of PTEN was inhibited by androgen treatment (Fig. 1D, right panel). As shown in Fig. 1E, PTEN-induced loss of cell viability was also inhibited markedly by androgens. Next we measured apoptosis by a nuclear condensation and fragmentation assay (40Murillo H. Huang H. Schmidt L.J. Smith D.I. Tindall D.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4795-4805Google Scholar). The constitutively active FKHR induced more than 15% apoptosis in LNCaP cells, and this was largely inhibited by androgens (Fig. 2). The death of LNCaP cells induced by FKHR(WT) alone or plus PTEN was markedly abrogated by androgen treatment. Androgens also inhibited PTEN-induced cell death (Fig. 2). Importantly, the androgen-mediated effects were reversed completely by co-treatment of cells with an androgen antagonist, bicalutamide, indicating that this is an androgen receptor-dependent event. Therefore, androgens inhibit cell death that is either induced by activated FKHR or potentiated by PTEN. Moreover, the androgen receptor appears to mediate these effects. Transactivation of FKHR Is Diminished by Androgen Action—Akt remains constitutively activated in PTEN-mutated LNCaP cells (7Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C. Ittmann M. Tycko B. Hibshoosh H. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Science. 1997; 275: 1943-1947Google Scholar, 21Davies M.A. Koul D. Dhesi H. Berman R.

This results in FKHR phosphorylation and disruption of its transactivation ability. However, the entire process can be reversed in LNCaP cells by forced expression of PTEN (23Nakamura N. Ramaswamy S. Vazquez F. Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested to determine whether PTEN-stimulated transactivation of FKHR is regulated by androgens. LNCaP cells were co-transfected transiently with PTEN and a luciferase reporter 3× IRS, which contains three copies of an FKHR response element from the promoter of the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 gene. Ectopic expression of PTEN resulted in an ∼8-fold increase in the transcriptional activity of endogenous FKHR protein in cells without R1881 treatment (Fig. 3A, white column 2 versus 1). However, this effect of PTEN was diminished by androgen treatment (Fig. 3A, black column 2 versus white column 2). Co-expression of PTEN and FKHR in LNCaP cells resulted in a robust increase in activity of the reporter gene (Fig. 3A, white columns 3 and 4) in comparison with the level activated by endogenous FKHR. However, this increase was also inhibited by the treatment of cells with 1 nm R1881 (Fig. 3A, black columns 3 and 4). These results suggest that androgens inhibit transcriptional activities of both the endogenous and transfected FKHR protein. A similar inhibitory effect of androgens on transactivation of FKHR was observed i"

Pentagalloylglucose also induces apoptosis in human leukemic cells. However, the mechanisms by which pentagalloylglucose induces these effects is unclear. We now show that pentagalloylglucose inhibits the activities of purified 20 and 26 S proteasomes in vitro, the 26 S proteasome in Jurkat T cell lysates, and chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26 S proteasome in intact Jurkat T cells. The turnover of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1/WAF1, which is necessary for cell cycle progression mediated by proteasome degradation, was disrupted by treatment of human Jurkat T cells with pentagalloylglucose. This was shown by cycloheximide treatment and in vivo pulse-chase labeling experiments, and this effect correlated with the arrest of proliferation of Jurkat T cells at G1. Inhibition of the proteasome by pentagalloylglucose and by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 caused accumulation of ubiquitin-tagged proteins in Jurkat T cells. The addition of pentagalloylglucose to Jurkat T cells enhanced the stability of the proteasome substrate Bax and increased cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Our findings suggest a mechanism for the effect of pentagalloylglucose on the cell cycle in human leukemic cells: that pentagalloylglucose down-regulates proteasome-mediated pathways because it is a proteasome inhibitor.

In eukaryotic cells, there are two distinct proteolytic mechanisms essential for regulating levels of cellular proteins. One is lysosomal mediated degradation, which is involved in the breakdown of intracellular proteins under conditions of cellular stress, membrane-associated proteins, and proteins that have entered the cell by endocytosis. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the other mechanism responsible for the turnover of intracellular proteins. This second system works by marking specific substrates with ubiquitins and degrading the marked proteins by the 26 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner. The 26 S proteasome, the main part of this pathway, is a large multiunit complex with a molecular mass of ∼1,500–2,000 kDa and is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells (1Coux O.

Hoffmann S. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 965-980Google Scholar) and retard cell cycle progression in tumor cells. The key regulators of cell survival and apoptosis, including members of the Bcl-2 family, some caspases, and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, have all been recognized as substrates of the proteasome (8Naujokat C. Hoffmann S. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 965-980Google Scholar). Inhibition of proteasome activity can induce apoptosis in cancer cells (17Drexler H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This includes the genus Rhus, Schinus, Galla, Paeoniae Radix (the root of Paeonia lactiflora Pallas), Moutan cortex (the root cortex of Paeonia suffruicos), Macaranga tanariu, Quercus pedunculata, peony, and green alga Spirogyra varians. 5GG has been found to have various biological activities; it inhibits lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-α secretion (22Feldman K.S.

Planta Med. 1996; 62: 436-439Google Scholar) and manifests an anticonvulsant action (31Sugaya A. Suzuki T. Sugaya E. Yuyama N. Yasuda K. Tsuda T.J. Ethnopharmacology. 1991; 33: 159-167Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we demonstrated that 5GG can induce cell cycle arrest at G1 phase (32Chen, W. J., Chang, C. Y., Liang, Y. C., and Lin, J. K. Biochem. Pharmacol., 65, 1777-1785Google Scholar) and apoptosis (33Pan M.H. Lin J.H. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Lin J.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 381: 171-183Google Scholar), suppress lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of NF-κB (34Pan M.H. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Ho C.T. Lin J.H. Lin J.K. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 2002; 453: 149-158Google Scholar). These antioxidative and antitumor properties suggest ways in which 5GG might be useful as a chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agent.Recent reports indicate that ester bond-containing phytopolyphenols, such as (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and tannic acids, potently and specifically inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of proteasomes in vitro and in vivo (36Nam S. Smith D.M. Dou Q.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13322-13330Google Scholar, 37Nam S. Smith D.M. Dou Q.P. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2001; 10: 1083-1088Google Scholar). The inhibition of chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase by elevating the levels of p27Kip1, a natural protein substrate of the 26 S proteasome. Because 5GG consists of five gallic acids, which are esterified to a glucose core, we presumed that the mechanism by which 5GG induces cell cycle arrest at G1 in the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 (32Chen, W. J., Chang, C. Y., Liang, Y. C., and Lin, J. K. Biochem. Pharmacol., 65, 1777-1785Google Scholar) involves not only the up-regulation of the expression of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1/WAF1 but also the down-regulation of the activity of the 26 S proteasome, leading to increasing protein stabilities of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1/WAF1.In the current study, we demonstrated that 5GG can selectively and specifically inhibit chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 and 26 S proteasome in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, this inhibition results in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and apoptosis, accompanied by the accumulation of ubiquitin-tagged proteins. It also results in the induction of proteasome-related proteins such as p27Kip1, p21Cip1/WAF1, and the proapoptotic protein Bax in human Jurkat T cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—1,2,3,4,6-Penta-O-galloyl-β-d-glucose was isolated from the leaves of Macaranga tanarins (L.)

After incubation, the reaction mixture was diluted to 400 μl with the assay buffer followed by measurement of hydrolyzed AMC groups (using a fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm).For measurement of the proteasome activity of whole cell extracts, 6 μg of Jurkat whole cell extract was incubated with 20 μm fluorogenic peptide substrates for chymotrypsin-like (Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC) or trypsin-like (Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC) or PGPH (Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-AMC) proteasome activities in 200 μl of the assay buffer with or without 5GG or MG132 or lactacystin for 90 min at 37 °C. After the reactions, the assay buffer was diluted to 400 μl, and the release of AMCs was quantified as described earlier.For proteasome activity in intact Jurkat T Cells, Jurkat T cells (2 × 105 cells/ml) in 24-well tissue culture plates were incubated with various concentrations of 5GG or MG132 or lactacystin for 12 h and then mixed with fluorogenic peptide substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC for chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity followed by an additional 2-h incubation. Afterward, 200 μl of cell medium was harvested and used for the measurement of free AMCs as described earlier.Assay for Calpain I Activity—The assay was performed as described previously (36Nam S. Smith D.M. Dou Q.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13322-13330Google Scholar, 37Nam S. Smith D.M. Dou Q.P. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2001; 10: 1083-1088Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 μg of purified calpain I was incubated with 40 μm fluorogenic peptide calpain substrate, Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC, for 30 min at 37 °C in 200 μl of assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% CHAPS with or without phytopolyphenols or the specific calpain inhibitor calpeptin (40Pinter M. Aszodi A. Friedrich P. Ginzburg I. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 170: 91-93Google Scholar). After incubation, the reaction mixture was diluted to 400 μl with the assay buffer, and a fluorescence spectrophotometer was used to detect free AMCs as described earlier.Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Purified 20 or 26 S proteasomes were analyzed by discontinuous PAGE under nondenaturing conditions. For the stacking gel, we used 3% acrylamide polymerized in 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5% sucrose; for the separating gel, we used 5 or 4.5% acrylamide in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris, 50 mm boric acid, 0.5% EDTA, pH 8.3), 2.5% sucrose, polymerized with ammonia persulfate (0.1%). The gels were run at 50 V for 700 V-h or 2100 V-h at 4 °CinTBE buffer and subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250.Western Blot Analysis—Human Jurkat T cells were treated with various concentrations of 5GG for 12 h or the indicated times. To rule out the effect of 5GG on protein synthesis, Jurkat T cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 2 h followed by coincubation with 5GG. Cells were harvested and homogenized in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of total cellular proteins (50 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% for Rb and pRb; 10% for β-actin, Akt, and Ser(P)473-Akt; 12.5% for p27, Thr(P)187-p27, and ubiquitin-tagged proteins; 15% for p21, Bax, and cytochrome c), transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and then probed with primary antibody followed by secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The immunocomplexes were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence kits (Amersham Biosciences).Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Jurkat T cells were methionine-starved for 20 min, pulse-labeled with 75 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences; 1,000 Ci/mmol) in methionine-free medium for 30 min, washed with PBS, and chased in complete medium containing 2 mm unlabeled methionine for 0, 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 h. 5GG (10 μm) was added at the beginning of the chase time. After incubation, cell lysates were prepared as described above and first precleared by incubation with protein A/G-agarose for 15 min, microcentrifuged, and then transferred to new tubes. Equal amounts of proteins were incubated with anti-p27Kip1 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose was added to absorb the immunocomplexes at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled p27Kip1 was visualized by autoradiography.Flow Cytometric Cell Analysis—Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry as follows. At each time point, cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed in 70% ethanol for at least 2 h at -20 °C. Fixed cells were washed with PBS, incubated with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.5 μg/ml RNase A and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 37 °C, and then stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. The stained cells were analyzed using a FAScan laser flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and ModFit LT cell cycle analysis software (Verity Software, Topsham, ME).Subcellular Fractionation—Mitochondrial and cytosolic (S100) fractions were prepared using differential centrifugation (33Pan M.H.

Briefly, Jurkat T cells were treated with 5GG or vehicle (Me2SO) for the indicated times. At the end of the treatment, cells were harvested, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in homogenizing buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiolthione, 17 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin (pH 7.4)) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were passed through a needle 10 times. Unlysed cells, large plasma membrane pieces, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was spun at 10,000 × g for 15 min. This pellet was resuspended in homogenizing buffer and represents the mitochondrial fraction. The remaining supernatant was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant from this final centrifugation represents the cytosolic (S100) fraction. The determination of cytochrome c release was performed by Western blot as described above.DNA Extraction and Electrophoresis Analysis—Jurkat T cells (2 × 105 cells/ml) were harvested, washed with PBS, and then lysed with digestion buffer containing 0.5% sarkosyl, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, 50 mm Tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA at 56 °C for 3 h and treated with RNase A (0.5 μg/ml) for another 2 h at 56 °C. The DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1) before loading and analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The agarose gels were run at 50 V for 120 min in TBE buffer (Tris borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer). Approximately 20 μg of DNA was loaded in each well, visualized under UV light, and photographed.RESULTSInhibition of the Purified 20 and 26 S Proteasome Activities by 5GG—Because the polyphenol-containing ester bond is considered to have the ability to inhibit chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome (36Nam S. Smith D.M. Dou Q.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13322-13330Google Scholar, 37Nam S. Smith D.M. Dou Q.P. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2001; 10: 1083-1088Google Scholar), we hypothesized that 5GG, which contains five ester bonds, might act as a proteasome inhibitor. In order to assess the inhibitory efficacy of 5GG on proteasome activity, we first performed the proteasome inhibition assay in a cell-free system. The chymotryptic activity of the 20 S proteasome was measured in vitro by monitoring the release of the fluorophore, AMC, from the synthetic peptide substrate, LLVY-AMC, in the presence of 5GG. As shown in Fig. 2, 5GG strongly inhibited chymotrypsin-like activity of purified M. thermophila (Fig. 2A), rabbit (Fig. 2B) 20 S proteasome, and purified rabbit 26 S proteasome (Fig. 2C). IC50 values were ∼73.2 nm, ∼4.64 μm, and ∼15.18 μm, respectively. This result (Fig. 2A) was similar to the inhibition curve of the ester bond-containing phytopolyphenols EGCG (36Nam S. Smith D.M. Dou Q.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13322-13330Google Scholar) and tannic acids (37Nam S. Smith D.M. Dou Q.P. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2001; 10: 1083-1088Google Scholar). We also examined the effects of 5GG on the PGPH activity of the purified M. thermophila 20 S proteasome. The PGPH activity was significantly inhibited by 5GG with an IC50 value of ∼122.5 nm (Fig. 2A). To ascertain that the inhibitory effect of 5GG on proteasome activity did not result from contaminated peptidase activities, the purities of proteasomes were assessed by SDS-PAGE and native PAGE. The purified M. thermophila 20 S proteasome was shown to be essentially homogeneous on native PAGE at a molecular mass of ∼645 kDa and gave two major subunits, α (24 kDa) and β (22 kDa), when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A, right panel). The purified rabbit 20 or 26 S proteasome on native PAGE also revealed a single major holoenzyme band at a high molecular mass of ∼700 or ∼1000 kDa, respectively, although the subunit compositions of the purified rabbit 20 or 26S proteasome appeared more heterogeneous (Fig. 2, B and C, right panels). Taken together, these data imply that 5GG is a proteasome inhibitor.Fig. 2Inhibitory effect of 5GG on purified M. thermophila (A) and rabbit 20 S (B) and rabbit 26 S proteasomes (C). Purified 20 or 26 S proteasome was incubated with 20 μm fluorogenic peptide substrates for chymotrypsin-like or PGPH activity in the presence of various concentrations of 5GG for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the fluorescent intensity of AMCs was determined using a fluorometer with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm and compared with the intensity of controls (without 5GG) defined as 100%. Shown are means ± S.E. for three independent experiments. As shown in the left panels, purified 20 or 26 S proteasome was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%) (S), and native PAGE (5% for M. thermophila source; 4.5% for rabbit sources) (N) was as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-PAGE showed that the 20 S proteasome from M. thermophila contained α and β subunits of ∼24 and 22 kDa. The parentheses displayed the major distribution of subunits with Mr values between 21- and 32-kDa in rabbit 20 S proteasome or between 34 and 110 kDa in rabbit 26 S proteasome. The holoenzyme sizes of purified M. thermophila 20 S proteasome and purified rabbit 20 and 26 S proteasomes were identified as bands of 645, 700, and 1000 kDa, respectively. The lanes labeled M1 denote a molecular weight marker for SDS-PAGE; the lanes labeled M2 denote a molecular weight marker for native PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Inhibition of 26 S Proteasome Activity in Jurkat T Cell Extracts by 5GG—Proteasome inhibitors make malignant cells more vulnerable to cell growth arrest and/or apoptosis by changing the stability or activity of numerous proteins that regulate cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Therefore, we next examined the inhibitory effects of 5GG on proteasome activity in tumor cell extracts. Whole cell lysates were prepared from exponentially growing cultures of human Jurkat T cells and then subjected to proteasome inhibition assays determined by the hydrolysis of fluorogenic substrates in the presence of 5GG as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the inhibition assay for chymotrypsin-like activity, 5GG showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect at concentrations from 1 to 5 μm. Similar to the inhibitory effects of well established proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin (IC50 of ∼0.53 and ∼1.64 μm, respectively), 5GG (IC50 of ∼1.38 μm) was potent against the chymotrypsin-like activity in Jurkat cell lysates (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Concentration-dependent inhibition of chymotrypsin-like (A), PGPH (B), and trypsin-like (C) 26 S proteasome activities in Jurkat T cell lysates by 5GG. 6 μg of Jurkat cell extracts was incubated with 20 μm of fluorogenic peptide substrates for chymotrypsin-like or PGPH or trypsin-like activity in the presence of various concentrations of 5GG, MG132, or lactacystin (or EGCG (A)) for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, levels of the free AMCs were determined using a fluorometer with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. Relative activity was calculated by dividing the observed fluorescent intensity by the intensity in the absence of 5GG. The proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin served as positive controls in these experiments. Shown are means ± S.E. for three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Selectivity and Specificity of the 26 S Proteasome Inhibition Mediated by 5GG—To elucidate the effects of 5GG on PGPH and trypsin-like proteasome activities in Jurkat cell lysates, 5GG at various concentrations was added to cell extracts of Jurkat T cells, and the inhibition of PGPH and trypsin-like proteasome activities was determined by proteasome assays with specific substrates for PGPH and trypsin-like activities. The results show that 5GG inhibits PGPH proteasome activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 24.94 μm, whereas 5GG only inhibited ∼33% of trypsin-like proteasome activity at 40 μm (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 led to the marked inhibition of PGPH and trypsin-like activities (IC50 of ∼2.83 and ∼13.48 μm, Fig. 3, B and C, respectively). Like MG132, lactacystin inhibited PGPH and trypsin-like activities with IC50 values of ∼9.02 and 34.96 μm, respectively (Fig. 3, B and C).To further determine the specificity of proteasome inhibition that is mediated by 5GG, we evaluated the effects of 5GG on the activity of purified calpain I (calcium-activated natural protease I), a cytosolic cysteine protease regulated by Ca2+ and ubiquitously distributed in various cells (44Tsujinaka T.

Most of the nucleophilic reactivity of B cells measured by formation of covalent adducts of a hapten amidino phosphonate diester was attributed to μ and κ/λ subunits of the B cell receptor. Secreted IgM Abs displayed superior nucleophilic reactivity than IgG Abs. IgM Abs catalyzed the cleavage of model peptide substrates at rates up to 344-fold greater than IgG Abs.

Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 591-599Google Scholar, 5Kohen F. Kim J.B. Linder H.R. Eshhar Z. Green B. FEBS Lett. 1980; 111: 427-431Google Scholar, 6Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Tewary H.K. Mehrotra S.

However, no consensus has developed whether naturally occurring catalytic Abs represent rare accidents arising from adaptive sequence diversification processes or genuine enzymes with important functional roles. The major reason is that the turnover (kcat) of antigen-specific IgG Abs is low. Some catalytic Abs express catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) comparable to conventional enzymes, but this is due to high affinity recognition of the antigen ground state (reviewed in Ref. 8Paul S. Chemical Immunology: Catalytic Antibodies. 77. S. Karger GmbH, Basel, Switzerland2000: 1-161Google Scholar). Certain enzymes cleave peptide bonds by a mechanism involving the formation of a transient covalent intermediate of the substrate and a nucleophilic residue present in the active site. The nucleophiles are generated by intramolecular activation mechanisms, e.g. the activation of Ser/Thr side chain hydroxyl groups by hydrogen bonding to His residues, and can be detected by covalent binding to electrophilic phosphonate diesters (9Oleksyszyn J. Powers J.C. Barrett A.J. Methods in Enzymology. 244. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 423-441Google Scholar, 10Sampson N.S. Barton P.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 22255-22263Google Scholar). Using these compounds as covalently reactive analogs of antigens (CRAs), we observed that IgG Abs express nucleophilic reactivities comparable to trypsin (11Planque S. Taguchi H. Burr G. Bhatia G. Karle S. Zhou Y.-X. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20436-20443Google Scholar). Despite their nucleophilic competence, IgG Abs display low efficiency proteolysis, presumably due to deficiencies in steps occurring after formation of the acyl-Ab intermediate, viz., water attack on the intermediate and product release. Occupancy of the B cell receptor (BCR, surface Ig complexed to α and β subunits along with other signal transducing proteins) by the antigen drives B cell clonal selection. Proteolysis by the BCR is compatible with clonal selection, therefore, only to the extent that the release of antigen fragments is slower than the rate of antigen-induced transmembrane signaling necessary for induction of cell division. Immunization with haptens mimicking the charge characteristics of the transition state (12Tramontano A. Janda K.D. Lerner R.A. Science. 1986; 234: 1366-1570Google Scholar) has been suggested as a way to surmount the barrier to adaptive improvement of catalytic rate constants. Catalysis by designer IgG Abs obtained by these means, however, also proceeds only slowly. In mice and humans, the initial Ab repertoire consists of ∼100 heritable VL and VH genes. Adaptive maturational processes expand the repertoire by several orders of magnitude. The initial BCR complex on the pre-B cell surface contains V-(D)-J rearranged Ig μ chains as a complex with surrogate L chains (reviewed in Ref. 13Melchers F. ten Boekel E. Seidl T. Kong X.C. Yamagami T. Onishi K. Shimizu T. Rolink A.G. Andersson J. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 175: 33-46Google Scholar). Precise assignment of the B cell differentiation stage at which cell division becomes antigen-dependent is somewhat ambiguous, but it is generally believed that non-covalent antigen binding to the pre-BCR is not required for initial cell growth. κ/λ chains replace the surrogate L chain at the later stages of antigen-driven B cell differentiation, which is accompanied by diversification via somatic hypermutation processes and continued gene rearrangements (14Prak E.L. Weigert M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 541-548Google Scholar, 15Papavasiliou F. Casellas R. Suh H. Qin X.F. Besmer E. Pelanda R. Nemazee D. Rajewsky K. Nussenzweig M.C. Science. 1997; 278: 298-301Google Scholar). V-(D)-J gene rearrangements allow development of specificity for individual antigens by IgM (16Xu J.L. Davis M.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 37-45Google Scholar) but antigen binding affinities tend to be low compared with IgG Abs. Somatic mutations accumulating in the V domains following isotype switching to IgG promote high affinity antigen recognition. In some anatomic locations, IgM Abs can be extensively mutated and can display high affinity antigen binding (17Dunn-Walters D.K. Hackett M. Boursier L. Ciclitira P.J. Morgan P. Challacombe S.J. Spencer J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1595-1601Google Scholar). Loss of a membrane anchoring peptide at the C terminus of the H chain results in production of secreted IgM and IgG Abs. Very little information is available about the developmental aspects of Ab catalysis. Here, we report the nucleophilic reactivity of secreted IgM and the Ig subunits expressed on the surface of B cells. Cell surface μ and κ/λ chains were the major sites of covalent reaction of a hapten CRA with B cells, and the magnitude of nucleophilic and proteolytic activities of secreted IgM Abs was consistently superior to IgG Abs.

Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) was from Sigma. BALB/c mice (5–6 weeks, female, Jackson Laboratories) were euthanized by cervical dislocation and splenocytes were prepared in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) by teasing apart the spleen and removing undissociated tissue (unit gravity sedimentation). Erythrocytes were lysed in hypotonic ammonium chloride (5 min; ACK Lysis Buffer, Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) and the cells washed twice with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl (PBS). B cells were isolated from splenocytes using a B cell negative selection isolation kit (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions and verified to be >95% CD19+ by flow cytometry as described below. Viability was determined using 0.05% Trypan Blue (90–95%). The cells (2–5 × 106 cells) were incubated with hapten CRA I or compound II (37 °C; final Me2SO concentration 1%) in 0.5 ml of PBS, washed thrice and treated with 100 μl of anti-CD16/32 Ab (10 μg/ml μl; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA; 5 min, 4 °C) to block Ab binding to Fc receptors. Staining was with FITC-conjugated streptavidin (1 μg/ml or as stated; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and PE-conjugated rat monoclonal Ab to CD19 (10 μg/ml; Caltag, Burlingame, CA) in 100 μl for 20 min at 4 °C. Following further washing with PBS (2×), the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (1 h, 4 °C), washed once and resuspended in PBS. In control incubations, an equivalent concentration of PE-conjugated isotype-matched rat Ab to an irrelevant antigen (BD Pharmingen) replaced the anti-CD19 Ab. Deconvolution microscopy was performed employing an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope and Applied Precision Delta work station (SoftWoRx™ software; Ref. 19Poindexter B.J. Pereira-Smith O. Wadhwa R.

The images were subjected to deconvolution (5 iterations) for each probe (FITC; λex 488 nm, λem 525 nm; DAPI; λex 350 nm, λem 470 nm; phycoerythrin; λex 565 nm, λem 578 nm). Flow cytometry was performed in the Baylor Medical College Core Facility (EPICS XL-MCLs Beckman-Coulter flow cytometer, EXPO32 software). Instrument calibration to minimize cross-detection of PE and FITC was done using cells stained individually with these fluorochromes. Forward and side scatter measurements allowed exclusion of dead cells from the gated cell population. CRA-stainable cells were identified as the population showing staining above the level observed for compound II staining. CRA-stainable CD19+ cells were estimated by subtraction of background observed using the isotypematched Ab. Cell extraction was by treatment with the detergent CHAPS (12 mm, 2 h at 4 °C). The extract was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 30 min), the supernatant diluted with PBS to 1 mm CHAPS and then subjected to affinity chromatography using goat polyclonal Abs (IgG) to mouse μ, γ, δ, λ, and κ chains (Caltag) immobilized on protein G-Sepharose columns (100 μl of settled gel; 0.6 × 5 cm columns; Amersham Biosciences). For this purpose, the Abs (50 μg) were mixed with the protein G gel in a column (15 min, 4 °C) in PBS containing 1 mm CHAPS (PBS-CHAPS), the gel allowed to settle, the unbound fraction collected and the columns washed with PBS-CHAPS. The cell extract (1.4 ml; diluted to 1 mm CHAPS; from 3 × 106 cells) was passed through the column, the column washed with PBS-CHAPS (9 volumes) and bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.7 (8 column volumes) and subjected to reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–20%, Bio-Rad). Protein-CRA adducts were visualized by staining nitrocellulose electroblots of the gels with streptavidin-peroxidase as in (11Planque S. Taguchi H. Burr G. Bhatia G. Karle S. Zhou Y.-X. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20436-20443Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the blots were stained with goat polyclonal Abs (IgG) to mouse μ, γ, δ, λ, and κ chains followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Fc specific, 1:1000; Pierce) as in Ref. 11Planque S. Taguchi H. Burr G. Bhatia G. Karle S. Zhou Y.-X. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20436-20443Google Scholar. Nominal mass values were computed by comparison with standard proteins (14–220 kDa; Amersham Biosciences). Secreted Ab-CRA Binding—Human serum Abs were from subjects without evidence of infection or immunological disease (2 females, 3 males; ages 23–45 years). Murine serum Abs were from BALB/c mice (purchased from Harlan, Indianapolis, IN; pooled from 150 mice; 8–12 weeks). Murine monoclonal IgM Abs used here are directed against major histocompatibility antigens (clones corresponding to catalog 8702, 8704, 9008, 9010, 9020; cell-free ascites; Cedarlane, Ontario, Canada). Monoclonal IgM Yvo is from a patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (20Shaw D.C. Shultz B.B. Ramsland P.A. Edmundson A.B. J. Mol. Recog. 2002; 15: 341-348Google Scholar). All monoclonal IgM Abs contain κ chains. The 4 murine monoclonal IgG Abs used here were: clone c23.4 (anti-VIP; Ref. 6Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Tewary H.K. Mehrotra S. Gianferrara T. Meldal M. Tramontano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13142-13145Google Scholar), clone c39.1 (anti-glucagon), 2S. Paul, unpublished observations. ATCC clones HP6045 (anti-Fab2, γ), and ATCC clone HP6054 (anti-Ig λ chain). All monoclonal IgG Abs contain γ2a heavy chains and κ light chains. Serum or ascites fluid (1 ml) was mixed for 1 h with 1 ml of Sepharose 4B conjugated rat anti-mouse IgM Abs (settled gel; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) or agarose-conjugated goat anti-human IgM Abs (Sigma) with IgM binding capacities 0.8 and 3 mg, respectively, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm CHAPS (buffer A). The unbound fraction was recovered and the gel washed with 20-buffer A volumes taking care that protein in the effluent had returned to undetectable levels prior to elution (A280 < 0.001). Elution was with 100 mm glycine pH 2.7 (0.5 ml/fraction into 25 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0). Further purification was on a Superose-6 FPLC gel filtration column (1 × 30 cm; 0.25 ml/min; Amersham Biosciences) in two different solvents: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1 m glycine, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.025% Tween-20 (buffer B), or 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in buffer B adjusted to pH 6.5 with HCl (buffer C). Prior to column fractionation, the affinity purified IgM was dialyzed against buffer C. Column calibration was with thyroglobulin (660 kDa), IgG (150 kDa), and albumin (67 kDa). IgM with Mr 900 kDa eluted close to the void volume of the column. IgM was renatured following buffer C chromatography by dialysis against buffer B (21Kalaga R. Li L. O'Dell J. Paul S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2695-2702Google Scholar). IgM Yvo, a cryoglobulin, was purified from serum by repetitive warming (37 °C) and cooling (4 °C; 3 cycles; Ref. 20Shaw D.C. Shultz B.B. Ramsland P.A. Edmundson A.B. J. Mol. Recog. 2002; 15: 341-348Google Scholar) followed by affinity chromatography on the antihuman IgM column. IgG was purified on protein G-Sepharose columns (21Kalaga R. Li L. O'Dell J. Paul S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2695-2702Google Scholar) using as starting material the unbound fraction from the anti-IgM columns or cell-free ascites. FPLC gel filtration of IgG was as described for IgM except that a Superose 12 column was employed. Fab fragments were prepared by digesting IgM (300 μl, 1 mg/ml) with agarose-conjugated pepsin (0.6 ml of gel, 30 min, 37 °C) in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% NaN3, 0.1 mm CHAPS) as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). The unbound fraction was dialyzed against buffer B, purified by FPLC gel filtration on a Superose 12 column and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1 m glycine, 0.1 mm CHAPS. Total protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Immunoblotting of SDS-gels contanining murine Abs was as in the preceding section. Human Ab gels were immunoblotted using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human μ, anti-human κ, and anti-human λ Abs (Sigma). Purified Abs were treated with the biotinylated CRAs in 50 mm Tris, HCl, 100 mm glycine, 0.1 mm CHAPS, pH 7.7 at 37 °C. Formation of Ab-CRA adducts was determined by SDS-electrophoresis as in the preceding section. Band intensities are expressed in arbitrary area units (AAU) determined by densitometry (11Planque S. Taguchi H. Burr G. Bhatia G. Karle S. Zhou Y.-X. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20436-20443Google Scholar). Initial velocities were computed as the slopes of progress curves plotted as a function of time (initial 60 min). Proteolysis Assays—Cleavage of the amide bond linking aminomethylcoumarin to the C-terminal amino acid in peptide-AMC substrates (Peptide International, Louisville, KY or Bachem, King of Prussia, PA) was measured in 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1 m glycine, 0.025% Tween-20 at 37 °C in 96-well plates by fluorimetry (λex 360 nm, λem 470 nm; Varian Cary Eclipse) (21Kalaga R. Li L. O'Dell J. Paul S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2695-2702Google Scholar). Authentic aminomethylcoumarin was used to construct a standard curve. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting rate data obtained at increasing concentrations of peptide-AMC substrates to the Michaelis-Menten-Henri Equation 1. ν=(Vmax[S])/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) Progress curves in the presence of inhibitors were fitted to Equation 2, [AMC]/[AMC]max=1-e(-kobs·t)(Eq. 2) where [AMC]max is the AMC concentration in the absence of inhibitor. IC50 (concentration yielding 50% inhibition) was obtained from Equation 3, %inhibition=100/(1+10log[IC50]-log[inhibitor])(Eq. 3) with the curve forced through 0. Irreversible CRA-B Cell Binding—Hapten CRAs such as compound I (Fig. 1) react irreversibly with nucleophilic sites in conventional serine proteases and Abs (9Oleksyszyn J. Powers J.C. Barrett A.J.

Biophys. 2002; 402: 281-288Google Scholar). To evaluate the nucleophilic reactivity expressed on the surface of B cells in the preimmune repertoire (viz., the repertoire developed spontaneously without purposeful immunological challenge), viable splenocytes from BALB/c mice were treated with hapten CRA I. The control compound II is identical in structure to hapten CRA I, except that the phosphonate group is not esterified, which results in loss of covalent reactivity with nucleophilic residues (11Planque S. Taguchi H. Burr G. Bhatia G. Karle S. Zhou Y.-X. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20436-20443Google Scholar, 18Nishiyama Y. Taguchi H. Luo J. Zhou Y.-Z. Burr G. Karle S. Paul S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 281-288Google Scholar). Treatment with hapten CRA I resulted in staining of most of cells at levels greater than compound II, with a minority of the cells displaying intense staining (11 ± 2, n = 3 experiments; determined by counting 400 lymphocytes using a UV microscope). All of the CRA I-stained cells displayed lymphocytic morphology, with no evident staining of monocytes or the occasional basophil. No loss of viability of the cells was evident following incubation with CRA I or compound II, as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Flow cytometry confirmed the microscopy results. Seventy-nine percent of the CRA I-treated cells displayed fluorescence intensities exceeding the compound II-treated cells, including a minority sub-population with very high fluorescence intensity (14%; sub-population 2 in Fig 2A). In three repeat experiments, the proportion of CRA I-stained cells that were positive for the B cell marker CD19 was 82 ± 4% (Fig. 2B). Deconvolution microscopy indicated that the fluorescence pattern due to hapten CRA I binding was nearly coincident with the anti-CD19 Ab fluorescence pattern (Fig. 2, C–E). Most of the CRA fluorescence was restricted to the surfaces of the B cells (Fig. 2F).Fig. 2Hapten CRA I reactivity with spleen cells. A, flow cytometry of murine splenocytes (naïve BALB/c mouse) stained with biotinylated hapten CRA I (gray line) and compound II (black line; both compounds 100 μm, 4 h; streptavidin-FITC (50 μg/ml). 25,000 cells were counted.

Blue counterstain, 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the nucleophilic molecules on the cell surface, purified B cells were labeled with CRA I, detergent extracts of the cells were boiled and then analyzed by SDS-electrophoresis. Only limited CRA-containing proteins were evident (Fig. 3A). As expected, silver staining revealed the presence of heterogeneous species, reflecting the complex protein constitution of the cells. The mass of the predominant CRA adduct band was 70 kDa, and this band was stainable by anti-μ chain Ab (Fig. 3B). Smaller amounts of CRA-containing bands were evident at 25, 40, 50, 55–60, 90–135, and 140 kDa. The bands at 55–60 kDa and 140 kDa were stainable by the anti-μ Ab, and the bands at 25 and 50 kDa were stainable with anti-κ/λ Ab. The anomalous μ and κ/λ bands at mass range different from the full-length monomer proteins presumably represent unreduced oligomers, breakdown products and truncated B cell Ig products, as also observed in previous studies of secreted Abs and B cell extracts (22Marks R. Bosma M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1862-1877Google Scholar, 23Li L. Sun M. Gao Q.S. Paul S. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 593-600Google Scholar, 24Malynn B.A. Shaw A.C. Young F. Stewart V. Alt F.W. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 547-556Google Scholar). The minor bands at 40 and 90–135 kDa that were not stainable with Abs to μ, γ, κ/γ (Fig. 3B) and δ chains (not shown) presumably represent non-Ig proteins. No CRA-containing adduct corresponding to Igγ chains were detected. Immunoblotting of the cell extracts identified a band at 50 kDa stainable with anti-γ Ab, but the band was visible only in highly overexposed gels, suggesting that only small amounts of γ chains were present in the extract. Confirmation that the CRA I adducts contain Ig subunits was by affinity chromatography on columns of immobilized Abs to μ, δ, γ, and κ/λ chains followed by SDS-electrophoresis (Fig. 3C). CRA-containing μ and κ/λ bands were evident in eluates from the anti-μ and anti-κ/λ columns. Recovery of CRA-containing μ chains in the eluate from the anti-κ/λ column can be explained by the presence of disulfide bonded light and heavy chain complexes on the cell surface. No CRA-containing bands were evident in eluates from the anti-γ and anti-δ columns (not shown), but this can not be interpreted to reflect deficient γ/δ chain nucleophilic reactivity, as these proteins are expressed only at low levels in B cells from immunologically naïve mice. To determine the proportion of overall cellular CRA staining attributable to complexation with Ig subunits, the B cell extract was fractionated on a single affinity column composed of immobilized Abs to μ and κ/λ chains. Eighty percent of the total CRA content of the cells was adsorbed by the column (not shown), determined by densitometry of the biotin-containing bands in the unbound fraction and the extract loaded on the column. Taken together, these observations indicate that most of the CRA staining of intact B cells is attributable to irreversible binding to surface Ig, with the μ chain accounting for most of the covalent reactivity. Nucleophilic Reactivity of Secreted IgM—The initial velocity for formation of hapten CRA I adducts by IgM purified from the pooled serum of immunologically naïve BALB/c mice was 40-fold greater than by IgG (Fig 4A; values are sums of velocities for the reactions occurring at the two Ab subunits expressed per unit concentration of intact Abs). The velocity difference is 8-fold when expressed per unit combining site concentration 3However, all 10 IgM valencies are usually not filled (e.g., Ref. 44Chavin S.I. Franklin E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1345-1352Google Scholar). (10 and 2 combining sites, respectively, in IgM and IgG). Three CRA-containing bands were observed in reducing SDS-gels of the IgM reaction mixtures at 70, 50, and 25 kDa (Fig. 4B). The 70 and 25 kDa bands were stainable with anti-μ and anti-κ/λ Abs, respectively. The 50-kDa band was stainable with anti-μ Ab and presumably represents a μ breakdown product. Two CRA-containing bands corresponding to γ and κ/λ chains were observed in reducing gels of the IgG reaction mixtures. Similar results were obtained with a panel of 6 randomly selected monoclonal IgM Abs (5 murine and 1 human) and 4 monoclonal IgG Abs (all murine). The monoclonal IgM Abs uniformly displayed superior rates of irreversible CRA I binding compared with the IgG Abs (Fig 4C; mean ± S.E.: 62.6 ± 24.4 × 104 and 1.9 ± 0.4 × 104 AAU/μm Ab/hour, respectively; p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test, 2-tailed). Consistent with the polyclonal Ab experiments, the μ chain accounted for most of the covalent binding in the polyclonal and monoclonal IgMs, but smaller levels of binding at the κ/λ chain subunit were also observed for every Ab preparation (for clarity, μ chain and the corresponding κ/λ chain data points from individual IgM preparations are connected in Fig. 4C; data are expressed per micromolar subunit concentration to allow ready comparison). The four monoclonal IgG Abs contain γ2a heavy chains, and all monoclonal IgM/IgG Abs contain κ light chains. No attempt was made to determine the nucleophilic reactivity of various γ chain isotypes. However, the polyclonal Ab data indicate that the average nucleophilic reactivity of the IgG isotype mixture in blood is lower than the IgM reactivity. A similar argument can be presented in regard to antigenic specificity. The 5 murine IgM Abs and 4 IgG Abs were raised by experimental immunization and bind different antigens (MHC antigens, VIP, glucagon, Ig subunits; Refs. 6Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Tewary H.K.

While two cysteine ligand residues (Cys42 and Cys61) are essential for the cluster assembly and/or stability, the contributions of the two histidine ligands to the cluster assembly in the archaeal Rieske-type ferredoxin appear to be inequivalent as indicated by much higher stability of the His64 → Cys variant (H64C) than the His44 → Cys variant (H44C). The x-ray absorption and resonance Raman spectra of the H64C variant firmly established the formation of a novel, oxidized [2Fe-2S] cluster with one histidine and three cysteine ligands in the archaeal Rieske-type protein moiety. Comparative resonance Raman features of the wild-type, natural abundance and uniformly 15N-labeled ARF and its H64C variant showed significant mixing of the Fe-S and Fe-N stretching characters for an oxidized biological [2Fe-2S] cluster with partial histidine ligation."
https://openalex.org/W2077159613,"Expression of the c-kit proto-oncogene product in neuroblastomas has been reported, but its clinical relevance is unclear. We determined the expression of c-kit by immunohistochemistry in a series of 155 neuroblastomas with long-term follow-up. The specificity of the reaction was verified by Western blot analysis and quantitative RT-PCR, and exon 11 of the kit gene was screened for mutations by PCR and capillary electrophoresis. No mutations were detected, and transcription of the kit gene correlated with protein expression. c-kit expression was associated with lower tumor stages and a low rate of MYCN amplification. More importantly, it coincided with tumor differentiation (P<0.0001), and portended a favorable outcome with a relative risk of 0.18 (P<0.0001). In a multivariate analysis of event-free survival, loss of c-kit (relative risk 4.25, P<0.0001) was an independent prognostic factor next to INSS stage 4 and before MYCN amplification. It is concluded that c-kit is transcriptionally regulated in neuroblastomas. Its expression likely identifies a subset of neuroblastomas with conserved capacity for differentiation, which may represent the embryonal variety of the disease. Assessment of c-kit may improve prognostic models for neuroblastoma and provide a basis for new therapy concepts."
https://openalex.org/W1990969735,"AGS3-LONG and AGS3-SHORT contain G-protein regulatory motifs that interact with and stabilize the GDP-bound conformation of Gαi > Gαo. AGS3 and related proteins may influence signal strength or duration as well as the adaptation of the signaling system associated with sustained stimulation. To address these issues, we determined the effect of AGS3 on the integration of stimulatory (Gαs-mediated vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor) and inhibitory (Gαi-mediated α2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR)) signals to adenylyl cyclase in Chinese hamster ovary cells. AGS3-SHORT and AGS3-LONG did not alter the VIP-induced increase in cAMP or the inhibitory effect of α2-AR activation. System adaptation was addressed by determining the influence of AGS3 on the sensitization of adenylyl cyclase that occurs following prolonged activation of a Gαi-coupled receptor. Incubation of cells with the α2-AR agonist UK14304 (1 μm) for 18 h resulted in a ∼1.8-fold increase in the vasoactive intestinal peptide-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase, and this was associated with a decrease in membrane-associated Gαi3. Both effects were blocked by AGS3-SHORT. AGS3-SHORT also decreased the rate of Gαi3 decay. A mutant AGS3-SHORT incapable of binding G-protein was inactive. These data suggest that AGS3 and perhaps other G-protein regulatory motif-containing proteins increase the stability of Gαi in the membrane, which influences the adaptation of the cell to prolonged activation of Gαi-coupled receptors.

The activation/deactivation cycle for heterotrimeric G-protein involves the exchange of GDP for GTP and the subsequent hydrolysis of GTP by Gα subunits. These events are generally initiated by a G-protein-coupled receptor at the cell surface. However, increasing evidence indicates the existence of unexpected regulatory mechanisms for the G-protein activation/deactivation cycle and a role for G-protein subunits in signaling events within the cell that do not involve a cell-surface receptor (1Blumer J.B Lanier S.M. Receptor Channels. 2003; 9: 1-10Google Scholar).

Lanier S.M. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34747-34750Google Scholar). A short form of AGS3 (AGS3-SHORT), enriched in heart tissue, lacks tetratricopeptide repeat motif domains and contains only three GPR motifs (13Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16601-16610Google Scholar). AGS3 has a domain structure similar to LGN, which was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen with Gαi2 (14Mochizuki N. Cho G. Wen B. Insel P.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 39-43Google Scholar), but the two proteins exhibit distinct tissue expression patterns (15Blumer J.B. Chandler L.J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15897-15903Google Scholar). AGS3 is nonhomogenously distributed within the cell (13Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16601-16610Google Scholar, 15Blumer J.B. Chandler L.J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15897-15903Google Scholar), and both immunofluorescence microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that only a subpopulation of AGS3 and G-protein α subunits may be complexed at any given time. This association is likely regulated and perhaps transient. Protein interaction assays with AGS3-GPR and cell lysates, as well as coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, indicate that the AGS3-GPR-Gα complex is free of Gβγ (3Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Google Scholar, 7Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1585-1593Google Scholar). It is not clear whether such complexes target Gα to specific cellular compartments, control the basal or stimulated activity of the system, or await an activating signal. AGS3 may operate within the context of the heterotrimeric G-protein activation/deactivation cycle by influencing subunit interactions. Alternatively, AGS3 may serve as a binding partner for a population of Gαi in the cell that exists free of Gβγ. AGS3-Gα complexes may be regulated by unexpected modes of signal input, which promote nucleotide exchange on the AGS3-Gαi-GDP complex and release “activated” or “functional” AGS3 and Gαi-GTP. An interaction of AGS3 with Gα in the absence of Gβγ may also function to hold Gα in the right place so that the signal input is more effectively processed, and, as such, the two-domain structure of AGS3 may serve as a type of scaffold within a larger signal transduction complex. The functional roles of AGS3, LGN, and other proteins containing GPR motifs in the cell are not fully defined. Proteins expressed in Drosophila melanogaster (PINS) and Caenorhabditis elegans (F32A6.4) possess a domain structure similar to that of AGS3 and LGN. PINS plays a key role in cell polarity, and this involves an apparent interaction of PINS with G-proteins (16Yu F. Morin X. Cai Y. Yang X. Chia W. Cell. 2000; 100: 399-409Google Scholar, 17Knoblich J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 11-20Google Scholar). The C. elegans proteins, gpr-1 and gpr-2, which contain GPR motifs in a different organizational context, and heterotrimeric G-proteins are involved in asymmetric positioning of the mitotic spindle at the two-cell stage of development (18Gotta M. Dong Y. Peterson Y.K. Lanier S.M. Ahringer J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1029-1037Google Scholar, 19Colombo K. Grill S.W. Kimple R.J. Willard F.S. Siderovski D.P. Gonczy P. Science. 2003; 300: 1957-1961Google Scholar, 20Srinivasan D.G. Fisk R.M. Xu H. Van Den Heuvel S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1225-1239Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, a reduction in LGN protein alters spindle dynamics (21Du Q. Stukenberg P.T. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1069-1075Google Scholar), and AGS3 may also play a role in the onset of autophagy (22Pattingre S. De Vries L. Bauvy C. Chantret I. Cluzeaud F. Ogier-Denis E. Vandewalle A. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20995-21002Google Scholar). There is essentially no information concerning how AGS3 and related proteins may influence basal aspects of G-protein-regulated events and integrate into signaling mechanisms involving GPCRs. As a first step in addressing these issues, we determined the effect of AGS3 on signal integration by Gαs- and Gαi-coupled receptors to the effector adenylyl cyclase. Whereas AGS3 did not alter signal integration following acute receptor activation, the adaptation (sensitization of adenylyl cyclase) of the system following prolonged activation of a Gαi-coupled receptor was blocked by AGS3. The prolonged activation of a Gαi-coupled receptor was associated with a decrease in membrane-associated Gαi3, and this decrease was also blocked by AGS3. Analysis of protein decay rates indicated that AGS3 actually stabilized Gαi3, increasing the t½ for the protein by 3-fold. These data suggest that sensitization of adenylyl cyclase observed with sustained activation of a Gαi-coupled receptor involves alteration in the amount of Gαi in a membrane fraction. AGS3-SHORT, and perhaps other GPR-containing proteins, may influence this process by stabilizing Gαi. Materials—Cyclic AMP enzyme immunoassay system, [125I]vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) (2000 Ci/mmol), and [3H]RX821002 (67 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Unlabeled VIP, UK14304, and Igepal CA-630 were obtained from Sigma. LipofectAMINE 2000 and FuGENE 6 transfection reagents were purchased from Invitrogen and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Tissue culture supplies were obtained from JRH Bioscience (Lenexa, KS). AGS3-LONG and AGS3-SHORT cDNAs were inserted into pcDNA3 and the constructs verified by DNA sequencing. The PCR product was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector and the sequence verified at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center DNA-sequencing facility. AGS3 antisera were generated as described previously (13Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16601-16610Google Scholar), and Gαi1/2 and Gαi3 antisera were generated as described previously (23Raymond J.R. Olsen C.L. Gettys T.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11064-11073Google Scholar, 24Gettys T.W. Fields T.A. Raymond J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4283-4290Google Scholar). Gβ1–4 antisera were kindly provided by Dr. John Hildebrandt (Department of Pharmacology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC) (25Makhlouf M. Ashton S.H. Hildebrandt J. Mehta N. Gettys T.W. Halushka P.V Cook J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 163-168Google Scholar). Gαi1 was purified from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant virus and kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Graber (West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, WV) (26Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1271-1278Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO cells and COS-7 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and Fungizone (0.25 μg/ml) in a CO2 incubator (5%) at 37 °C. For transfection, cells were suspended at 1.5–4.0 × 105 cells/ml, and 0.5 ml (24-well plate), 2 ml (6-well plate), or 10 ml (100-mm dish) were plated. After 18 h, the cells were transfected with 1.0–1.25 μg (24-well plate), 5 μg (6-well plate), or 12 μg (100-mm dish) of cDNA with FuGENE 6 or LipofectAMINE 2000, as recommended by the manufacturer. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was monitored by pEGFP transfection to generate a fluorescent signal, and protein expression was monitored by ligand binding assays and immunoblotting. Transfection efficiency was 40–60%. Neither receptor nor AGS3 transfection altered the cell number/well at 48 h after transfection. Cell Lysis and Fractionation—Cells grown in 6-well plates were washed with 2 × 2 ml of PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4) at 4 °C and harvested in 200 μl of detergent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Igepal CA-630). For cell fractionation, cells cultured in 10-cm dishes were harvested in PBS and resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and a protease inhibitor tablet-Complete Mini (Roche Applied Science)) with a 26⅜-gauge syringe. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to generate a crude membrane pellet and a supernatant that represented the cytosol. The pellet was resuspended with 50 volumes of membrane buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.6 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and a protease inhibitor tablet-Complete Mini (Roche Applied Science)) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 4 volumes of membrane buffer. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad or DC Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Measurement of Intracellular cAMP—CHO cells were transiently transfected in 24-well dishes. 48 h following transfection, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS-HEPES) (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm Na2HPO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were equilibrated with 0.5 ml of HBSS-HEPES for 20 min at 37 °C, and then the reaction was started by buffer replacement with 0.5 ml of HBSS-HEPES containing agonist. The reaction was terminated following 5 min of incubation by aspiration of buffer and the addition of 0.25% of dodecyltrimethylammonium supplied with the enzyme immunoassay system (Biotrak, Amersham Biosciences). The content of cyclic AMP in the detergent-soluble fraction was measured according to the manufacturer's protocol. The initial system validation indicated that the increase in cAMP elicited by 10 nm VIP was linear for at least 10 min of incubation with the agonist. Radioligand Binding Assays—Cells were rinsed twice with HBSS-HEPES buffer. For [125I]VIP binding, cells were incubated with HBSS-HEPES buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.2 μCi [125I]VIP for 1 h at 24 °C (27Lundberg P. Lundgren I. Mukohyama H. Lehenkari P.P Horton M.A. Lerner U.H. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 339-347Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined with 0.2 μm of unlabeled VIP. For [3H]RX821002 binding, the cells were incubated with HBSS-HEPES buffer containing 20 nm of [3H]RX821002 for 30 min at 24 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined with 10 μm of rauwolscine (Carl Roth, GmbH & Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany). At the end of incubation, the buffer was aspirated, cells were washed 4–5 times with 1 ml PBS and treated with 100 μl of trypsin-EDTA (0.5 mg/ml) for 10 min at 24 °C, and radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter or by liquid scintillation counting. Typically, ∼5–10% of the applied radioligand bound to the cells, and nonspecific binding was ∼25% of specific binding. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Key residues in the GPR motif for binding to G-protein α-subunits were mutated with a site-directed mutagenesis system (QuikChange, Stratagene) using sense and antisense mutagenic primers, respectively, as follows: Q57A, 5′-GAGCCGCCGGCTGGATGACGCGAGGGCTAGCGTAGGCAGC-3′; 5′-GCTGCCTACGCTAGCCCTCGCGTCATCCAGCCGGCGGCTC-3′; Q105A, 5′-GTCCTCCAGGATTGATGACGCGCGCTGTCCACCCCCTGATG-3′; 5′-CATCAGGGGGTGGACAGCGCGCGTCATCAATCCTGGAGGAC-3′; Q129A, 5′-GCGGATGGATGAGGCACGTGTGGACCTGGC-3′; 5′-GCCAGGTCCACACGTGCCTCATCCATCCGC-3′. Generation of GST Fusion Protein and Protein Interaction Assays— The coding sequence of AGS3-SHORT or AGS3-SHORT-Q/A was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and fused in-frame to glutathione S-transferase in the pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-AGS3-SHORT fusion protein was expressed in bacteria (Escherichia coli BL21, Amersham Biosciences) and purified on a glutathione affinity matrix. The GST fusion protein was eluted from the resin, and glutathione was removed by desalting to allow a solution-phase interaction assay. For protein interaction studies with isolated Gαi1, GST, or GST fusion proteins (300 nm) were incubated with 30 or 300 nm Gαi1 in 250 μl of incubation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.6 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 70 mm NaCl, 0.01% Lubrol, 10 μm GDP, and 10 mm MgCl2) for 120 min at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Thirty μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose was added, and incubation was continued at 4 °C for 30 min. Samples were then centrifuged, and the matrix was washed three times with 500 μl of incubation buffer prior to solubilization in Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins retained on the matrix were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—COS-7 cells grown in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA or pcDNA::AGS3-SHORT. After 48 h, the cells were incubated with methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min. Next, the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (1 μCi/μl, Expre35S35S, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 3 h in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Following labeling, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with normal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm methionine and 1 mm cysteine. The cells were harvested in 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer at the indicated times. The cell lysates were incubated with 2 μl of Gαi3 antibody for 18 h following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were incubated with 25 μl of 50% Sepharose-G for 1 h at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed three times with RIPA buffer. Proteins were eluted in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer and resolved on SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to film for 1–3 days at –70 °C. Subsequent to autoradiography, the gel was rehydrated and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting to confirm efficiency of immunoprecipitation among groups. Immunoblotting and Data Analysis—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (7Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1585-1593Google Scholar). The luminescence image was captured with an image analyzer (LAS-1000plus, FUJIFILM). The luminescence and autoradiogram images were quantified using Image Gauge 3.4 (FUJIFILM). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. from independent experiments as described in the figure legends. Statistics were performed using unpaired Student's t test, F-test, and analysis of variance (StatView 5.0, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Regression analysis was performed by Prism (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA) and StatView 5.0. The precise mechanism by which GPR-containing proteins process signals via an interaction with G-proteins in a spatially and temporally discrete manner and the role of such accessory proteins in signal integration from GPCRs at the cell surface are not defined. By virtue of its ability to bind up to four Gαi-GDPs (7Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1585-1593Google Scholar, 28Adhikari A. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51825-51832Google Scholar) and compete with Gβγ for binding to Gαi-GDP, AGS3 may potentially regulate both base-line signaling for G-protein regulated effectors as well as signals initiated by activation of a GPCR. Reconstitution studies in Sf9 membranes indicated that a GPR peptide and the AGS3-GPR domain prevents G-protein coupling to the receptor, but it is not clear whether the receptor actually has access to Gαi-GDP-AGS3-GPR and, if so, whether it is recognized by a receptor (8Peterson Y.K. Bernard M.L. Ma H. Hazard III, S. Graber S.G. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33193-33196Google Scholar, 29Ma H. Peterson Y.K. Bernard M.L Lanier S.M. Graber S.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8085-8093Google Scholar). Thus, AGS3 may block GPCR signals involving Gαi-GTP. Alternatively, following initiation of the G-protein activation/deactivation cycle in response to a GPCR agonist, AGS3 may “grab” Gαi-GDP before it rebinds Gβγ, potentially prolonging signal input to Gβγ effectors. The AGS3-Gαi-GDP complex then may require an as yet undefined signal that promotes guanine nucleotide exchange on Gαi and its dissociation from AGS3. Both of these scenarios also have implications for receptor internalization and recycling and other cell adaptations to prolonged activation of Gαi-coupled receptors, such as adenylyl cyclase sensitization (30Watts V.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1-7Google Scholar). To address these issues, we established a transient expression system in CHO cells that allowed us to study signal integration to the effector adenylyl cyclase in the presence and absence of AGS3. CHO cells were transiently transfected with the Gαs-coupled vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor (VIPR), and the Gαi-coupled α2-adrenergic receptor (human α2-AR) were transiently transfected with AGS3 or vector control (Fig. 1, A and B). Agonists for these receptors did not elicit any effect in nontransfected cells. In receptor transfectants, VIP elicited a 35-fold increase in cAMP, and this effect was inhibited by the α2-AR agonist UK14304 (Fig. 1, C and D); thus, the system is optimized to detect signal integration only in the transfected population of cells. The expression of either AGS3-LONG or AGS3-SHORT did not alter the increases in cAMP elicited by activation of the VIPR (Fig. 1C) nor did it influence the inhibition of this response observed upon activation of α2-AR (Fig. 1D). Cotransfection of AGS3-SHORT or -LONG also did not alter α2-AR expression or [125I]VIP binding (Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting of cell extracts and known amounts of a GST-AGS3 fusion protein indicated that ∼1–2 pmol of AGS3 were expressed per mg of protein. 3M. Sato and S. M. Lanier, unpublished observations. The amounts of Gαi proteins in CHO cell membranes are estimated at ∼5.4 pmol/mg (23Raymond J.R. Olsen C.L. Gettys T.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11064-11073Google Scholar, 31Gettys T.W. Sheriff-Carter K. Moomaw J. Taylor I.L. Raymond J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 82-91Google Scholar). Whereas one AGS3 molecule can bind multiple Gα subunits and the AGS3 expression level is underestimated as only a subpopulation of cells that are actually transfected, the amount of AGS3 would be sufficient to bind a substantial population of Gαi in the cell. These observations further suggest that the transduction apparatus mediating signal integration to adenylyl cyclase is tightly regulated and that AGS3 access to this system is restricted by compartmentalization. Access to the transduction apparatus may involve activation of the signaling pathway itself and/or regulatory mechanisms, such as phosphorylation of AGS3, which influences the interaction of GPR motifs with G-proteins (32Blumer J.B. Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Nezu J. Chung P. Dunican D.J. Knoblich J.A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23217-23220Google Scholar, 33Hollinger S. Ramineni S. Hepler J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 811-819Google Scholar). These data indicate that simply expressing AGS3 proteins in the cell did not alter Gαi-mediated input to adenylyl cyclase and suggest that an additional signal may be required to position the protein in the proper context within the cell. Indeed, subcellular location of the related protein LGN and the AGS3/LGN orthologs in D. melanogaster and C. elegans is dependent upon the cell cycle and the stage of cell development (15Blumer J.B. Chandler L.J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15897-15903Google Scholar, 16Yu F. Morin X. Cai Y. Yang X. Chia W. Cell. 2000; 100: 399-409Google Scholar, 17Knoblich J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1069-1075Google Scholar). To further address the role of AGS3 in the G-protein activation/deactivation cycle, we examined the influence of AGS3 on system adaptation following receptor activation. In the face of sustained stimulation of Gαi-coupled receptors, the adenylyl cyclase system adapts such that the activation of adenylyl cyclase elicited by a Gαs-coupled receptor is enhanced (30Watts V.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1-7Google Scholar). Sensitization of the adenylyl cyclase system is observed with a variety of Gαi-coupled receptors and isoforms of adenylyl cyclase in multiple types of cells. Indeed, such sensitization is thought to play a role in the cellular adaptation of tolerance and/or addiction observed with opiates (30Watts V.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1-7Google Scholar, 34Avidor-Reiss T. Bayewitch M. Levy R. Matus-Leibovitch N. Nevo I. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29732-29738Google Scholar). 4M. S. Bowers, R. W. Lake, K. McFarland, Y. K. Peterson, S. M. Lanier, C. C. Lapish, and P. W. Kalivas, submitted for publication. AGS3 is also implicated in another form of cellular adaptation in the central nervous system that occurs in response to exposure to the stimulant cocaine. To induce sensitization of adenylyl cyclase, CHO cells cotransfected with VIPR, α2-AR and AGS3, or vector were incubated with the α2-AR agonist UK14304 for 18 h (Fig. 2). cAMP accumulation in response to VIP was increased by ∼1.8-fold following prolonged activation of the α2-AR (Fig. 2A). The sensitization of the Gαs-mediated signal was inhibited by the expression of AGS3-SHORT (Fig. 2A). As expected (34Avidor-Reiss T. Bayewitch M. Levy R. Matus-Leibovitch N. Nevo I. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29732-29738Google Scholar), the sensitization of the Gαs-mediated signal was completely blocked by cell pretreatment with pertussis toxin, which effectively uncouples receptors from Gαi/Gαo proteins.3 The effect of AGS3-SHORT on sensitization of the Gαs-mediated increase in cAMP required intact GPR motifs, as it was not observed with a mutated form of AGS3-SHORT (AGS3-SHORT-Q/A) in which critical residues in the GPR motifs (Q57, Q105, Q129 in AGS3-SHORT) were replaced with alanine (Fig 2B). The change in this key residue markedly reduces the ability of the GPR motif to interact with Gαi-proteins (Fig. 2B) (35Peterson Y.K. Hazard III, S. Graber S.G. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6767-6770Google Scholar). These data indicate that the observed effect of AGS3-SHORT on system adaptation requires interaction with Gαi proteins. Prolonged incubation of the cells with UK14304 did not influence α2-AR expression or [125I]VIP binding at the cell surface. Incubation of cells with the α2-AR agonist (18 h) also did not alter the ability of the α2-AR to mediate inhibition of VIP-induced increases in cAMP, 5M. Sato and S. M. Lanier, unpublished observations. Transfected CHO cells were treated with 1 μM UK14304 for 18 h and α2-AR mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activated by VIP was examined. The magnitude of the α2-AR mediated inhibition was not altered by prolonged agonist exposure although there was a tendency for a decrease in potency, which did not reach statistical significance. reflecting the limited ability of this α2-AR subtype to undergo desensitization and down-regulation (36Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Google Scholar, 37DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Google Scholar). As AGS3 clearly interacts with Gαi-GDP, we asked whether it influenced the dynamics of Gαi processing during sustained activation of a Gαi-coupled receptor. The amount of Gαi3 associated with the membrane fraction was decreased with pretreatment of UK14304, and this decrease was reversed by expression of AGS3-SHORT (Fig. 3). Neither UK14304 nor AGS3 expression altered the amounts of Gαs or Gβ in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3).3 The effect of AGS3-SHORT on the retention of Gαi in the membrane fraction likely involves interaction with Gαi proteins, as it was not observed with the AGS3-SHORT-Q/A mutant (Fig. 3). The sustained activation of α2-AR also resulted in the movement of AGS3-SHORT from the cytosol to the membrane fraction (Fig. 3). There was also a slight increase in the amount of AGS3-SHORT-Q/A in the membrane following receptor activation, which may reflect a weak interaction with Gαi or the role of another AGS3-binding partner. Thus, AGS3-SHORT may block the sensitization of Gαs-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase by stabilizing the amount of Gαi in a membranous domain. The alterations in the dynamics of Gαi processing by AGS3-SHORT during prolonged activation of the α2-AR may reflect either increased delivery of Gαi to the membrane by a chaper-one function of AGS3 or antagonism of the events involved in degradation or redistribution (38Bayewitch M.L.

We addressed this issue by evaluating the processing and stability of both endogenous Gαi3 and transfected Gαi3. AGS3 GPR motifs selectively interact with Gαi and do not apparently distinguish among the three Gαi subtypes, of which only Gαi2 and Gαi3 are expressed in CHO cells (7Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K.

We focused our efforts on Gαi3 as a representative member of the Gαi subgroup of G-proteins. The t½ of endogenous Gαi3 was determined by pulse labeling of proteins with [35S]methionine/cysteine and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4). Gαi3 was lost from the cells with an apparent t½ of 13.4 h, and this rate was reduced 3-fold in cells transfected with AGS3-SHORT (t½ = 37.9 h) (Fig. 4). We also determined the stability of transfected Gαi3 by the immunoblotting of cell lysates at increasing intervals following blockade of protein synthesis. Under these conditions, immunoreactive Gαi3 was lost from the cells with an apparent t½ of ∼4.14 h, and this rate was reduced in cells cotransfected with AGS3-SHORT but not AGS3-SHORT-Q/A (Fig. 5A). Parallel experiments with Gαs indicated that the effect of AGS3 was specific for Gαi, as AGS3 did not alter the Gαs decay rate (Fig. 5B). Although the mechanisms for regulated degradation of Gαi are not defined, these data suggest that either the interaction of AGS3-SHORT (or other GPR-containing proteins) with G-protein prevents the interaction of Gαi with proteins involved in the degradation of Gαi or prevents the propagation of a signal that initiates the degradation of Gαi in response to prolonged activation of a Gαi-coupled receptor.Fig. 5Effect of AGS3 on the stability of transfected Gαi3 and Gαs. Effect of AGS3 on the levels of Gαi3 (A) or Gαs (B) following inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide. CHO cells grown in a 35-mm dish were transfected with 2.5 μg of pcDNA3::Gαi3 (A) or pcDNA3::Gαs (B), and 2.5 μg of pcDNA3 (CNT), pcDNA3::AGS3-SHORT (SHORT), or pcDNA3::AGS3-SHORT-Q/A (SHORT-Q/A).

These data suggest that the location and amount of Gαi3 is crucial for the development of sensitization of adenylyl cyclase following long-term activation of a Gαi-coupled receptor system. AGS3 may short-circuit the sensitization process by altering an agonist-induced destabilization of Gαi."

In order to study ES control, we made reporter lines with a green fluorescent protein gene inserted behind the promoter of different ESs. We attempted to disrupt the silencing machinery, and we used fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis for the rapid and sensitive detection of ES up-regulation. We find that a range of treatments that either block nuclear DNA synthesis, like aphidicolin, or modify DNA-like cisplatin and 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine results in up-regulation of silent ESs. Aphidicolin treatment was the most effective, with almost 80% of the cells expressing green fluorescent protein from a silent ES. All of these treatments blocked the cells in S phase. In contrast, a range of toxic chemicals had little or no effect on expression. These included berenil and pentamidine, which selectively cleave the mitochondrial kinetoplast DNA, the metabolic inhibitors suramin and difluoromethylornithine, and the mitotic inhibitor rhizoxin. Up-regulation also affected other RNA polymerase I (pol I) transcription units, as procyclin genes were also up-regulated after cells were treated with either aphidicolin or DNA-modifying agents. Strikingly, this up-regulation of silent pol I transcription units was bloodstream form-specific and was not observed in insect form T. brucei. We postulate that the redistribution of a limiting bloodstream form-specific factor involved in both silencing and DNA repair results in the derepression of normally silenced pol I transcription units after DNA damage.

The predominant VSG is encoded by a gene transcribed from 1 of about 20 telomeric VSG expression sites (ES). Switching VSG coats is mediated by DNA rearrangements moving a new VSG into the active ES from a repertoire of hundreds of silent VSG genes and pseudogenes in chromosome internal tandem arrays or at telomeres. Alternatively, a switch can be mediated by a transcriptional switch between ESs. The large polycistronic ES transcription units contain an assortment of expression site-associated genes (ESAGs) in addition to the telomeric VSG (reviewed in Ref. 5Pays E. Lips S. Nolan D. Vanhamme L. Perez-Morga D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 1-16Google Scholar). Although the basic ES structure is conserved, there is variation in exactly which ESAGs are present, as well as their number and order (6Berriman M. Hall N. Sheader K. Bringaud F. Tiwari B. Isobe T. Bowman S. Corton C. Clark L. Cross G.A. Hoek M. Zanders T. Berberof M. Borst P. Rudenko G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 122: 131-140Google Scholar). Switching between the polymorphic ESAGs present in different ESs can allow the trypanosome to adapt to life in different hosts. This has been best investigated for the polymorphic ESAG6 and -7 genes encoding transferrin receptor subunits (7Bitter W. Gerrits H. Kieft R. Borst P. Nature. 1998; 391: 499-502Google Scholar, 8Gerrits H. MuBmann R. Bitter W. Kieft R. Borst P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 237-247Google Scholar, 9Isobe T. Holmes E.C. Rudenko G. J. Mol.

The polycistronic ESs are regulated as domains flanked upstream by extensive arrays of 50-bp repeats (12Horn D. Cross G.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 555-561Google Scholar). Exogenous promoters integrated upstream of the 50-bp repeat arrays escape the transcriptional control operating on the downstream ES (13Sheader K. Berberof M. Isobe T. Borst P. Rudenko G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 147-156Google Scholar). In bloodstream form T. brucei, ES control is not sequence-specific (12Horn D. Cross G.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 555-561Google Scholar, 14Rudenko G. Blundell P.A. Dirks-Mulder A. Kieft R. Borst P. Cell. 1995; 83: 547-553Google Scholar), does not appear to involve a repressed chromatin state (15Navarro M. Cross G.A. Wirtz E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2265-2272Google Scholar, 16Navarro M. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 53-66Google Scholar), or require homologues of genes involved in yeast telomere position effect, despite having a superficial resemblance to this phenomenon (17Conway C. McCulloch R. Ginger M.L. Robinson N.P. Browitt A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21269-21277Google Scholar). The multiple ESs are transcribed in a mutually exclusive fashion (reviewed in Ref. 18Borst P. Cell. 2002; 109: 5-8Google Scholar). Stable maximal activation of two ESs does not appear possible (19Chaves I. Rudenko G. Dirks-Mulder A. Cross M. Borst P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4846-4855Google Scholar). Selection for double ES expressors using selectable markers inserted immediately downstream of different ES promoters results in trypanosomes that have one ES maximally active and another ES partially up-regulated, or that rapidly switch between two different ESs (19Chaves I. Rudenko G. Dirks-Mulder A. Cross M. Borst P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4846-4855Google Scholar, 20Ulbert S. Chaves I. Borst P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 225-235Google Scholar). Possibly these rapidly switching trypanosomes alternate between a privileged subnuclear location that has been called an expression site body (ESB), a pol I transcriptional body specific to bloodstream form T. brucei (21Navarro M. Gull K. Nature. 2001; 414: 759-763Google Scholar). Location in an ESB transcription/RNA processing factory may give the active ES access to limiting factors necessary for transcription elongation and polyadenylation (22Vanhamme L. Poelvoorde P. Pays A. Tebabi P. Van Xong H. Pays E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 328-340Google Scholar). In contrast, in insect form T. brucei all ESs appear to be down-regulated to a great extent, although not as tightly as in the bloodstream form (23Rudenko G. Blundell P.A. Taylor M.C. Kieft R. Borst P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5470-5482Google Scholar). Silencing is mechanistically different, as it is promoter sequence-specific and appears to involve repressed chromatin (15Navarro M. Cross G.A. Wirtz E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2265-2272Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that the telomeric location of ESs is critical for silencing in this life cycle stage, as ES promoters on circular bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) are as effectively silenced as those in the genome (24te Vruchte D. Aitcheson N. Rudenko G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 123-133Google Scholar). In order to investigate the machinery mediating ES down-regulation in bloodstream form T. brucei, we constructed reporter T. brucei strains with GFP inserted immediately behind the promoter of silenced ESs. We attempted to disrupt the silencing machinery using various chemical treatments. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis allowed rapid and sensitive detection of ES derepression. We find that treatments inhibiting DNA synthesis or causing DNA damage result in a block in S phase and a concurrent up-regulation of silent ESs. In addition, up-regulation of procyclin transcript was also observed. Procyclin is transcribed from RNA polymerase I transcription units that are normally down-regulated in the bloodstream form. Surprisingly, this up-regulation of transcripts from normally silent sites is life cycle-specific, as there was no evidence for up-regulation of silenced ESs in insect form T. brucei after comparable treatments. We postulate the presence of a limiting bloodstream form-specific factor involved in both silencing and DNA repair. Redistribution after DNA damage could result in the derepression of normally silenced pol I transcription units. T. brucei Transformants and Culturing Conditions—All trypanosomes used were T. brucei 427, and bloodstream form variants were all derived from T. brucei 427 VSG221a (25Bernards A. de Lange T. Michels P.A. Liu A.Y. Huisman M.J. Borst P. Cell. 1984; 36: 163-170Google Scholar). Bloodstream form T. brucei was maintained at 37 °C in HMI-9 medium with the addition of 10% fetal calf serum and 10% Serum Plus (JRH Biosciences) (26Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Google Scholar). In order to ensure population homogeneity of the VSG coat expressed, trypanosome transformants with drug markers in the active VSG ES were continuously maintained on the appropriate drug selection pressure to prevent ES switching. The T. brucei RP2X-1 transformant was described previously (14Rudenko G. Blundell P.A. Dirks-Mulder A. Kieft R. Borst P. Cell. 1995; 83: 547-553Google Scholar). T. brucei HNI has a hygromycin gene inserted immediately behind the promoter of the 221 ES and a neomycin gene inserted behind the promoter of the VO2 ES and was described previously (27Rudenko G. Chaves I. Dirks-Mulder A. Borst P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 97-109Google Scholar). T. brucei 221GP1(221+) has a GFP gene in the active 221 ES and was made by replacing the hygromycin gene in the active 221 ES of T. brucei HNI(221+) with the 221GP1 construct containing GFP and the puromycin resistance gene. These trypanosomes were subsequently selected on G418 to select for trypanosomes that had activated the neomycin gene marked VO2 ES and silenced the GFP, resulting in T. brucei 221GP1(VO2+). T. brucei VO2GP1(VO2+) has GFP in the active VO2 ES and was made by modifying T. brucei HNI(VO2+) by replacing the neomycin gene in the active VO2 ES with the VO2GP1 construct containing the GFP and blasticidin genes. These trypanosomes were subsequently selected on hygromycin to select for trypanosomes that had activated the hygromycin gene marked 221 ES and silenced the VO2 ES producing T. brucei VO2GP1(221+). The hygromycin resistance gene was subsequently replaced by a gene encoding puromycin resistance to create T. brucei VO2GP2(221+). Insect form T. brucei 427 was maintained at 27 °C in SDM-79 medium with the addition of 10% fetal calf serum (28Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292Google Scholar). The insect form T. brucei transformants (RPX1-1, ESX1-1, ESX1-2, and rDES1-1) were described previously (23Rudenko G. Blundell P.A. Taylor M.C. Kieft R. Borst P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5470-5482Google Scholar) and were maintained on 25 μg ml–1 hygromycin. Transfection Constructs—The 221GP1 construct has a puromycin resistance gene excised from construct pBS-Pur (gift of Isabel Roditi, University of Berne) (29Ruepp S. Furger A. Kurath U. Renggli C.K. Hemphill A. Brun R. Roditi I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1369-1379Google Scholar) and inserted between tubulin intergenic regions containing splice and polyadenylation sites (23Rudenko G. Blundell P.A. Taylor M.C. Kieft R. Borst P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5470-5482Google Scholar). The GFP gene is eGFP (Clontech) flanked upstream by the tubulin 3′ splice site present on a tubulin intergenic region, and downstream by the 221 VSG untranslated region and polyadenylation signal. The downstream flanking sequences are on a 612-bp fragment amplified by PCR using Pwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science) from a genomic clone of the 221 VSG 2T. Isobe and G. Rudenko, unpublished data. using the following primers: 221VSG3445s, 5′-TTTCCCCCCTCAAATTTCCCC-3′, and 221VSG4057as, 5′-CGAAAAATTAAGATTCAAAACCACGG-3′. The 1.3-kb 5′ 221 ES target fragment was amplified from the H25N7 BAC containing the 221 VSG ES (GenBank™ account number AL671259) (6Berriman M. Hall N. Sheader K. Bringaud F. Tiwari B. Isobe T. Bowman S. Corton C. Clark L. Cross G.A. Hoek M. Zanders T. Berberof M. Borst P. Rudenko G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 122: 131-140Google Scholar) using PCR with Pwo polymerase and primers as follows: HNES481s, 5′-TTAAGCTTTCTAACACTTCCTTTTTG-3′, and VO228551as, 5′-AACCTCAATGGACGAAGGAG-3′. Integration of the construct was 216 bp downstream of the transcription start site. The 714-bp 3′ 221 ES target fragment was isolated from the H25N7 BAC using primers 221–73592s 5′-ACGAAGAGCAGGGGTGCAAC-3′ and HNES4244as 5′-GCTTCATCTGC-TGGTCGTCTTC-3′. The VO2GP1 construct was analogous to the 221GP1 construct, and only the puromycin resistance gene was replaced by a blasticidin resistance gene from construct tubBSRtub (gift of P. Borst, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam), and the target fragments were amplified by PCR from the N19B2 BAC containing part of the VO2 ES (GenBank™ account number AL671256) (6Berriman M. Hall N. Sheader K. Bringaud F. Tiwari B. Isobe T. Bowman S. Corton C. Clark L. Cross G.A. Hoek M. Zanders T. Berberof M. Borst P. Rudenko G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 122: 131-140Google Scholar). The 5′ target fragment was amplified using the HNES481s and VO228551as primers listed above. The 3′ target fragment was amplified using primers VO2–118336s 5′-CTCTAGTGAGCGTATTTTAGAGG-3′ and HNES 4244as. T. brucei Transformation—Transfection was performed using mid-log phase bloodstream form trypanosomes, which were washed and then resuspended at 5 × 107 ml–1 in cytomix without glutathione or ATP (30van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Google Scholar). 2.5 × 107 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of linearized DNA using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II with a single pulse of 1.5-kV and 25-microfarad capacitance in 0.2-cm cuvettes (Bio-Rad). After ∼6 h recovery in HMI-9 medium, cells were distributed over 24-wells plates at densities between 7 × 104 and 3 × 105 cells ml–1. Selection was with 0.2 μg ml–1 puromycin (Sigma) or 2 μg ml–1 blasticidin (Invitrogen). After 5–7 days on selection transformants were expanded for further analysis. ES Switching—ES switching was performed using drug selection on agarose plates (31Carruthers V.B. Cross G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8818-8821Google Scholar). T. brucei 221GP1(221+) with the puromycin gene in the active 221 ES was maintained in the presence of 0.2 μg of puromycin ml–1 (Sigma). To switch to the VO2 ES, 1 × 105 to 1 × 107 trypanosomes were spread on agarose plates containing 5 μg of G418 (Invitrogen) ml–1. Colonies were counted after 9–10 days to determine the switching frequency (average of 4.4 × 10–6 determined on three plates) and analyzed by PCR to check for retention of the previously active 221 ES (27Rudenko G. Chaves I. Dirks-Mulder A. Borst P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 97-109Google Scholar). T. brucei VO2GP1(VO2+) was switched in an analogous fashion; only these trypanosomes were maintained on 2 μgof blasticidin ml–1 and selected on 5 μg of hygromycin ml–1 to select for activation of the 221 ES. The frequency of 221 ES activation was 3 × 10–6 (average of four plates). Again PCR was used to monitor for retention of the VO2 ES. T. brucei Chemical or DNA Damage Treatments—Mid-log phase cultures were pelleted and resuspended in fresh medium to remove drug selection pressure. Bloodstream form T. brucei was resuspended at 5 × 105 cells ml–1, and insect form T. brucei was resuspended at 5 × 106 cells ml–1. Cultures were treated with the appropriate chemical for 24 h for bloodstream form T. brucei unless stated otherwise in the figure legends or 48 h for insect form T. brucei. Alternatively, bloodstream form T. brucei was exposed to UV or γ-radiation and then recovered for 24 h. Aphidicolin, MNNG, berenil, pentamidine, suramin, trichostatin A, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), and pCPT-cAMP were all from Sigma, and ethidium bromide from BDH. Cisplatin was a gift of Adrian Begg and Ben Floot (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam) and rhizoxin a gift of Keith Gull. Growth curves were initially performed with each of the different substances, and concentrations were chosen that flattened cell growth in a comparable fashion. Concentrations used are as follows: aphidicolin (30 μm) (32Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Google Scholar), MNNG (2 μgml–1) (20Ulbert S. Chaves I. Borst P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 225-235Google Scholar, 33King D.L. Turco S.J. Mol. Biochem.

Englund P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 950-954Google Scholar), suramin (400 nm), trichostatin A (2 μg ml–1), DFMO (difluoromethylornithine) (200 μm) (35Zweygarth E. Kaminsky R. Acta Trop. 1991; 48: 223-232Google Scholar), pCPT-cAMP (1 mm) (36Breidbach T. Ngazoa E. Steverding D. Exp. Parasitol. 2002; 101: 223-230Google Scholar), ethidium bromide (8 μm) (37Boibessot I. Turner C.M. Watson D.G. Goldie E. Connel G. McIntosh A. Grant M.H. Skellern G.G. Acta Trop. 2002; 84: 219-228Google Scholar), cisplatin (4 μm) (38Balber A.E. Gonias S.L. Pizzo S.V. Exp. Parasitol. 1985; 59: 74-80Google Scholar), and rhizoxin (10 nm) (32Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Google Scholar). UV irradiation was performed with 3840 J/m2 UV light (254 nm) using a UV cross-linker (Stratagene). Cells were in 25 ml of tissue culture dishes with the lid removed during exposure (adapted from Ref. 39Johnson P.J. Kooter J.M. Borst P. Cell. 1987; 51: 273-281Google Scholar). γ-Irradiation was performed using a 137Cs source (Gravitron RX30/55M, Graviner Manufacturing, Gosport, Hampshire, UK). Trypanosomes in HMI-9 medium were placed at a proximity to the cesium source so that the dose rate was 4.4 gray/min for a total dose of 160 gray. After removal from the exposure to UV or γ-radiation, cells were recovered for 24 h. The number of double-strand DNA breaks introduced into the T. brucei genome was estimated using agarose blocks containing T. brucei transfected with BACs of ∼150 kb (24te Vruchte D. Aitcheson N. Rudenko G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 123-133Google Scholar). Introduction of a single double-strand break into these large circles results in linearization. We estimated that 160 gray irradiation resulted in the introduction of ∼370 double-strand breaks into the T. brucei genome. FACS Analysis—Derepression of GFP was analyzed by FACS using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. After treatment and recovery, cells were washed once in PSG (60 mm Na2HPO4, 3 mm NaH2PO4, 44 mm NaCl, 56 mm glucose) and resuspended at 106 cells ml–1 for analysis. Data were analyzed using CellQuest software version 3.3. To correct for fluorescence of the chemical used, T. brucei HNI, which lacks GFP, was also treated and analyzed by FACS, and any fluorescence in the FL-1 channel was subtracted from the final values. In addition, values were corrected by subtracting background fluorescence of untreated cells containing silenced GFP. For cell cycle analysis cells were stained with propidium iodide as described previously (40Hammarton T.C. Clark J. Douglas F. Boshart M. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22877-22886Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment and recovery, cells were fixed in 70% methanol (106 cells ml–1) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μg ml–1 propidium iodide and 10 μg ml–1 RNase A, and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Detector FL2-A and an AmpGain value of 1.75 were used. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from bloodstream form T. brucei treated for 24 (bloodstream form) or 48 h (procyclic form) with various chemicals in the absence of drug selection pressure. RNA was isolated from ∼3 to 5 × 107 cells using an RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). 5 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed in formaldehyde gels and blotted according to Ref. 41Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar. Northern blots were hybridized with probes radiolabeled by random priming using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). The probe for eGFP is a 719-bp SalI/NotI fragment from the eGFP plasmid (Clontech). The probe for the 221 VSG is an 800-bp fragment of the 221 VSG corresponding to positions 122–925 in the sequence (GenBank™ account number X56762). The probe for the VO2 VSG is a 600-bp EcoRI/HindIII fragment from the VO2 VSG cDNA. 3K. Sheader and G. Rudenko, unpublished data. The tubulin probe is a 700-bp HindIII/EcoRI fragment. The procyclin probe is the entire CPT4 cDNA (42Rudenko G. Bishop D. Gottesdiener K. Van der Ploeg L.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4259-4263Google Scholar). The procyclin probe can be expected to hybridize with transcript from both the EP and GPEET procyclin variants. Quantitation was performed with a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager. DNA Damage Results in the Up-regulation of GFP Marked Silent ESs—We constructed T. brucei strains with GFP immediately downstream of the promoter of the inactivated 221 or VO2 VSG ESs. As the ES promoters were silent, these strains allowed us to assay for disruption of the ES silencing machinery. We introduced a puromycin resistance gene linked to GFP into the active 221 VSG ES of T. brucei HNI(221+) (27Rudenko G. Chaves I. Dirks-Mulder A. Borst P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 95: 97-109Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The resulting transformant T. brucei 221GP1(221+) had the hygromycin gene located downstream of the 221 VSG ES promoter of T. brucei HNI(221+) replaced by a puromycin gene. As this modified variant of T. brucei HNI contains a neomycin gene located downstream of the silent VO2 VSG ES promoter, selection with G418 allowed us to screen for reactivation of the VO2 VSG ES, producing the reporter strain T. brucei 221GP1(VO2+) (Fig. 1B). T. brucei expressing GFP from an active VSG ES is more than 1000-fold brighter than background, allowing it to be very easily detected (Fig. 1C). FACS analysis of the T. brucei 221GP1(VO2+) trypanosomes with a silenced GFP provided a very sensitive and rapid assay system for measuring a change in expression of the silent VSG ES. We incubated the T. brucei 221GP1(VO2+) reporter strain with a range of chemicals in order to screen for those resulting in the up-regulation of silent VSG ESs. First, we tested the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, which generally causes derepression of silenced transcription units in a wide range of experimental systems due to disruption of repressed chromatin (reviewed in Ref. 43Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 423-430Google Scholar). Although trichostatin A suppressed growth of bloodstream form T. brucei, it had no detectable effect on derepression of the silent 221 VSG ES (result not shown). As there is no evidence that silenced ESs in bloodstream form T. brucei have a more repressed chromatin structure than active ESs (15Navarro M. Cross G.A. Wirtz E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2265-2272Google Scholar, 16Navarro M. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 53-66Google Scholar), this result is not surprising. Although trichostatin A did not cause up-regulation of silent ESs, a range of treatments resulting in DNA modification or damage did (Fig. 2). Effective treatments that resulted in high levels of up-regulation of normally silent VSG ESs included DNA-modifying agents. Cisplatin treatment results in the introduction of a bulky cisplatin adduct into DNA (44van de Vaart P.J. Belderbos J. de Jong D. Sneeuw K.C. Majoor D. Bartelink H. Begg A.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 89: 160-166Google Scholar), and MNNG methylates DNA (45Bignami M. O'Driscoll M. Aquilina G. Karran P. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 71-82Google Scholar). Treatment of bloodstream form T. brucei with both of these chemicals resulted in up to 40% of the cells expressing GFP (Fig. 2). Treatment with UV light also resulted in DNA modification in the form of thymidine dimers. This treatment was also effective at producing the up-regulation of GFP, as was the intercalating agent ethidium bromide. DNA damage in the absence of DNA modification was also effective in inducing up-regulation of GFP transcript. The introduction of double-strand DNA breaks with a cesium source also resulted in very high levels of silent VSG ES up-regulation, with more than 50% of the cells expressing GFP (Fig. 2). In contrast, berenil and pentamidine selectively induced double-strand breaks in the kinetoplast DNA rather than nuclear DNA (34Shapiro T.A. Englund P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 950-954Google Scholar). Treatment with these drugs did not result in significant ES derepression. Treatment with the metabolic inhibitor suramin (46Fairlamb A.H. Bowman I.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1980; 1: 315-333Google Scholar) or the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor DFMO (35Zweygarth E. Kaminsky R. Acta Trop. 1991; 48: 223-232Google Scholar, 47Phillips M.A. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8721-8727Google Scholar) also had no detectable effect, despite inhibiting T. brucei cell growth in a comparable fashion to the other treatments (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). It is therefore likely that modification or damage of nuclear DNA is the key factor in the up-regulation of silent ESs that we observed. Up-regulation of Silent ESs Correlates with a Block in S Phase—Treatment of T. brucei with DNA-modifying agents resulted in a block in DNA synthesis, as observed by measuring incorporation of BrdUrd in treated cells (result not shown) (48Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Google Scholar). In order to block nuclear DNA synthesis without introducing DNA damage, we incubated bloodstream form T. brucei with aphidicolin, which selectively binds and inhibits nuclear DNA polymerase α (49Pedrali-Noy G. Spadari S. J. Virol. 1980; 36: 457-464Google Scholar, 50Sheaff R. Ilsley D. Kuchta R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8590-8597Google Scholar). Aphidicolin has been used previously to stall trypanosomes at the G1/S phase transition (32Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Google Scholar, 51Mutomba M.C. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 89-102Google Scholar). Treatment of bloodstream form T. brucei 221GP1(VO2+) with 30 μm aphidicolin resulted in very striking up-regulation of the silenced GFP (Fig. 2). Almost 80% of the cells expressed GFP, with almost 20% of the cells expressing GFP at maximal levels (dark bar in Fig. 2) (see Fig. 1C for description of the gates used). As up-regulation of silent ESs was observed after treatments that resulted in a block in nuclear DNA synthesis, we investigated if this could also be observed if T. brucei was stalled in the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle. DNA synthesis is inhibited in stumpy form T. bruc"
https://openalex.org/W1964883350,"Tim9, Tim10a, and Tim10b are members of the family of small Tim proteins located in the intermembrane space of mammalian mitochondria. In yeast, members of this family act along the TIM22 import pathway during import of metabolite carriers and other integral inner membrane proteins. Here, we show that the human small proteins form two distinct hetero-oligomeric complexes. A 70-kDa complex that contains Tim9 and Tim10a and a Tim9-10a-10b that is part of a higher molecular weight assembly of 450 kDa. This distribution among two complexes suggests Tim10b to be the functional homologue of yeast Tim12. Both human complexes are tightly associated with the inner membrane and, compared with yeast, soluble 70-kDa complexes appear to be completely absent in the intermembrane space. Thus, the function of soluble 70-kDa complexes as trans-site receptors for incoming carrier proteins is not conserved from lower to higher eukaryotes. During import, the small Tim complexes directly interact with human adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) in transit in a metal-dependent manner. For insertion of carrier preproteins into the inner membrane, the human small Tim proteins directly interact with human Tim22, the putative insertion pore of the TIM22 translocase. However, in contrast to yeast, only a small fraction of Tim9-Tim10a-Tim10b complex is in a stable association with Tim22. We conclude that different mechanisms and specific requirements for import and insertion of mammalian carrier preproteins have evolved in higher eukaryotes.

We conclude that different mechanisms and specific requirements for import and insertion of mammalian carrier preproteins have evolved in higher eukaryotes. Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes, translated at cytosolic ribosomes, and imported to their final destination in the mitochondrion. Import of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial preproteins is a multistep process mediated by a common translocase in the outer membrane, the TOM 1The abbreviations used are: TOM, translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane; TIM, translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane; DDP1, deafness-dystonia peptide 1; ΔΨ, membrane potential; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; PK, proteinase K; o-phe, orthophenanthrolin; DSP, dithiobis-succinimidylpropionate; AAC, ATP/ADP carrier; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator. 1The abbreviations used are: TOM, translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane; TIM, translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane; DDP1, deafness-dystonia peptide 1; ΔΨ, membrane potential; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; PK, proteinase K; o-phe, orthophenanthrolin; DSP, dithiobis-succinimidylpropionate; AAC, ATP/ADP carrier; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator. complex, and two distinct translocases in the inner membrane, named TIM23 and TIM22 complex (1Koehler C.M. Merchant S. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 428-432Google Scholar, 2Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 339-349Google Scholar, 3Jensen R.E. Dunn C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 25-34Google Scholar, 4Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Neupert W. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 57-90Google Scholar). The TOM complex is used by all known nuclear-encoded precursors and translocates them into and across the outer membrane. The TIM23 and the TIM22 complex show different substrate specificities and energy requirements. Presequence-containing proteins are translocated across the inner membrane into the matrix via the TIM23 complex; whereas polytopic inner membrane proteins without presequences but with internal targeting signals use the TIM22 complex. The mitochondrial import pathways are evolutionary conserved and many components of the mitochondrial import machineries characterized in the fungal system have counterparts in mammalian mitochondria (5Hoogenraad N.J. Ward L.A. Ryan M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 97-105Google Scholar). The TIM23 complex consists of the integral membrane components Tim23, Tim17, and Tim50. Tim23 and Tim17 constitute the protein-conducting channel and act in cooperation to form a receptor for presequences in the intermembrane space (6Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Schneider H.C. Klaus C. Dietmeier K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1085-1093Google Scholar, 7Bauer M.F. Sirrenberg C. Neupert W. Brunner M. Cell. 1996; 87: 33-41Google Scholar, 8Truscott K.N. Kovermann P. Geissler A. Merlin A. Meijer M. Driessen A.J. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Wagner R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1074-1082Google Scholar). Tim50 exposing its large C-terminal domain to the intermembrane space was proposed to facilitate the transfer of precursor proteins to the translocation channel (9Geissler A. Chacinska A.

Translocation across the inner membrane is initially driven by the membrane potential ΔΨ, while further direction into the matrix is mediated by an ATP-dependent molecular motor at the matrix site of the inner membrane. It is composed of the peripheral membrane protein Tim44 that recruits the mitochondrial mtHsp70 and the nucleotide exchange factor Mge1 (12Okamoto K. Brinker A. Paschen S.A. Moarefi I. Hayer-Hartl M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3659-3671Google Scholar, 13Moro F. Sirrenberg C. Schneider H.C. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3667-3675Google Scholar, 14Liu Q. D'Silva P. Walter W. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Science. 2003; 300: 139-141Google Scholar). Recently, Tim14 was identified as a new component of the mitochondrial import motor that binds to Tim44 and mtHsp70 in an ATP-dependent manner thereby activating mtHsp70 (15Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4945-4956Google Scholar). Most hydrophobic proteins of the inner membrane such as the polytopic members of the mitochondrial carrier family are synthesized with internal targeting signals and inserted into the inner membrane via the TIM22 complex (16Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Google Scholar). In yeast, the TIM22 complex consists of the integral membrane components Tim22, Tim54, and Tim18. Tim22 is the major component of the TIM22 complex and is structurally related to Tim17 and Tim23 suggesting that both TIM complexes have evolved from a common ancestor (16Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Google Scholar). Similar to the TIM23 complex it forms a voltage-gated channel in the inner membrane (17Rehling P. Model K. Brandner K. Kovermann P. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Kuhlbrandt W. Wagner R. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Science. 2003; 299: 1747-1751Google Scholar). Tim54 exposes a large domain to the intermembrane space and is required for the stability of Tim22 but may not interact directly with translocating precursor proteins (18Kerscher O. Holder J. Srinivasan M. Leung R.S. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1663-1675Google Scholar). Tim18 is structurally related to the subunit IV of the succinate dehydrogenase (complex II of the respiratory chain). It might be involved in the assembly and stability of the TIM22 complex (19Kerscher O. Sepuri N.B. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 103-116Google Scholar, 20Koehler C.M. Murphy M.P. Bally N.A. Leuenberger D. Oppliger W. Dolfini L. Junne T. Schatz G. Or E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1187-1193Google Scholar). In humans, a Tim22 protein sharing ∼40% homology to yeast Tim22 was identified (21Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Google Scholar). Homologues of Tim54 and Tim18 appear not to be expressed in mammals. For import of integral inner membrane proteins the TIM22 complex interacts with a group of structurally related proteins located in the intermembrane space, the so named small Tim proteins (22Adam A. Endres M. Sirrenberg C. Lottspeich F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 313-319Google Scholar, 23Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M.

The small Tim proteins belong to an evolutionary conserved family of putative zinc finger proteins. They are thought to function as molecular chaperones that guide hydrophobic membrane proteins across the aqueous environment of the intermembrane space and maintain them in an import-competent conformation. In yeast, the small Tim proteins named Tim9, Tim10, and Tim12 specifically mediate the import and insertion of metabolite carriers into the inner membrane (25Koehler C.M. Jarosch E. Tokatlidis K. Schmid K. Schweyen R.J. Schatz G. Science. 1998; 279: 369-373Google Scholar, 26Endres M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3214-3221Google Scholar, 27Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7528-7536Google Scholar). They are organized in two distinct hetero-oligomeric complexes. A soluble 70-kDa complex presumably consisting of three molecules Tim9 and three molecules Tim10 associates with the incoming precursor still associated with the TOM-complex by binding to hydrophobic segments (28Wiedemann N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 951-960Google Scholar, 29Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 942-953Google Scholar); in a second complex one molecule Tim10 is substituted by one Tim12 (22Adam A. Endres M. Sirrenberg C. Lottspeich F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 313-319Google Scholar). This complex is part of a 300-kDa high molecular mass complex which in addition comprises the membrane integral components of the TIM22 translocase. The membrane association of this TIM9-10-12 complex is mediated by Tim12 shown to directly interact with Tim22 (23Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Google Scholar). Upon releasing from the TOM complex the precursor proteins are passed on from the TIM9-10 to this membrane-associated TIM9-10-12 complex for insertion into the inner membrane (26Endres M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3214-3221Google Scholar). The inserted carriers assemble into functional dimers (30Dyall S.D. Agius S.C. De Marcos Lousa C. Trezeguet V. Tokatlidis K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26757-26764Google Scholar). The insertion of the hydrophobic preproteins into the inner membrane depends on the presence of a membrane potential but does not require ATP. The family of small Tim proteins comprise two further proteins, Tim8 and Tim13 (31Koehler C.M. Leuenberger D. Merchant S. Renold A. Junne T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2141-2146Google Scholar). In contrast to Tim9, Tim10 and Tim12 they are not essential for the viability of yeast. Tim8 and Tim13 are also organized in the intermembrane space in a hetero-oligomeric 70-kDa complex. In particular, they do not assist the import of the hydrophobic carrier proteins into the inner membrane. Recently, it was shown that both proteins effect import in vitro of non-carrier proteins of the inner membrane such as Tim23 (32Leuenberger D. Bally N.A. Schatz G. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4816-4822Google Scholar, 33Davis A.J. Sepuri N.B. Holder J. Johnson A.E. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1271-1282Google Scholar, 34Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K. Bauer M.F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6392-6400Google Scholar). The Tim8-13 complex traps the incoming precursors in the intermembrane space thereby maintaining them in a translocation competent conformation. In mammals six members of the family of small Tims are expressed. One homologue of each Tim9 and Tim13 (human Tim9 and Tim13) and two homologues of each Tim10 (Tim10a and Tim10b) and Tim8 (DDP1 and DDP2) were described (21Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Google Scholar, 35Jin H. Kendall E. Freeman T.C. Roberts R.G. Vetrie D.L. Genomics. 1999; 61: 259-267Google Scholar). DDP1 is the deafness-dystonia peptide, which is mutated in Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, dystonia, mental retardation and blindness (31Koehler C.M. Leuenberger D. Merchant S. Renold A. Junne T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2141-2146Google Scholar, 36Jin H. May M. Tranebjaerg L. Kendall E. Fontan G. Jackson J. Subramony S.H. Arena F. Lubs H. Smith S. Stevenson R. Schwartz C. Vetrie D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 177-180Google Scholar). Homologues of Tim12 appear to be neither expressed in humans nor in lower eukaryotes except Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All six homologues are ubiquitously expressed at the mRNA level in human organs excluding that the a and b variants of Tim8 and Tim10 represent tissue specific or developmental isoforms (21Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Google Scholar, 35Jin H. Kendall E. Freeman T.C. Roberts R.G. Vetrie D.L. Genomics. 1999; 61: 259-267Google Scholar). However, only five of these can be found at the protein level in human mitochondria (37Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Google Scholar). So far, all attempts failed to detect endogenous DDP2 although it can be excluded that it is a transcribed pseudogene (21Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Google Scholar). Yet, it is not clear whether DDP2 is an authentic protein that is expressed at levels that cannot be detected by conventional biochemical techniques or is expressed in specific types of cells. Recently, we have characterized the human components DDP1 and Tim13 in more detail. They form soluble 70-kDa hetero-oligomeric complexes in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and act in a manner similar to the yeast Tim8-Tim13 complex during import of Tim23 into the inner mitochondrial membrane (37Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Google Scholar, 38Hofmann S. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Neupert W.

The differences found between humans and yeast in the requirement for functional DDP1-Tim13 versus Tim8–13 complexes during the import of precursors has been suggested as a molecular basis for the development of the Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome (37Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Google Scholar). Here, we have investigated the structure and function of Tim9, Tim10a, and Tim10b, the human homologues of the essential small Tim proteins of yeast. We show that they also form two distinct hetero-oligomeric complexes, which are in contrast to the human DDP1-Tim13 tightly associated with the outer face of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Both complexes interact in a metal-dependent manner with the adenine nucleotide translocator during import and with Tim22 for insertion into the inner membrane. Preparation of Mitochondria and Submitochondrial Fractions—Mitochondria from yeast cells were isolated as described before (40Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Craig E.A. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 893-902Google Scholar). Mitochondria from frozen HeLa cells or mouse liver were prepared in 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.4 by differential centrifugation and subsequent sucrose step gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (41Bauer M.F. Gempel K. Reichert A.S. Rappold G.A. Lichtner P. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 69-82Google Scholar). In order to selectively open the outer membrane isolated mitochondria were treated with low concentrations of digitonin (0.08–0.1% w/v) at 4 °C for 30 min. The reisolated mitoplasts were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer pH 7.4 and incubated with 500 mm NaCl or 100 mm Na2CO3 for 30 min at 4 °C when indicated. Membrane fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Proteins from the supernatants were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Size Determination of the Native Complex—Human mitochondria (250–500 μg) were solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 or 0.5% digitonin in 0.5 ml of column buffer (1 × PBS, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge (30 min), the clear supernatant was subjected to a Superose-12 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and chromatographed at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min in column buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100 or 0.05% digitonin. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies as indicated. As calibration standards apoferritin (440 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (132 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) were used. Immunoprecipitation—Isolated mitochondria were resuspended at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in column buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 0.5% digitonin and lysed on ice for 30 min. After a clarifying spin for 30 min at 100,000 × g aliquots corresponding to 50 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated using affinity-purified antibodies against human Tim9, Tim10a, Tim10b, or Tim22 prebound to protein A-Sepharose beads. The complexes were dissociated in SDS-containing sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In Vitro Synthesis of Precursor Proteins and Import into Mitochondria—Precursor proteins were synthesized by coupled transcription/translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine using the respective cDNAs encoded on a pGEM4Z plasmid. Import reactions into mitochondria freshly prepared from mouse liver were carried out for 15–20 min at 25 °C in import buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm KH2PO4,50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2). For generation of a membrane potential mitochondria were preincubated with 2.5 mm ATP, 5 mm NADH, and 2.5 mm succinate for 10 min at 25 °C. The membrane potential was dissipated by the addition of 1 μm valinomycin and 50 μm CCCP. The reactions contained 1 μg/μl of mitochondrial protein and 4% reticulocyte lysate containing the radiolabeled precursor protein. Aliquots corresponding to 50 μg of mitochondrial protein were either incubated with protease (30–200 μg/ml proteinase K) for 20 min on ice followed by incubation with protease inhibitor (5 min on ice) or left untreated. For generation of mitoplasts the import assay was diluted in 10 volumes of swelling buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.4; 0.1% digitonin). Mitochondria were washed twice in HS buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4; 0.6 m sorbitol), subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. For cross-linking experiments, import reactions were performed in import buffer using 7.5% reticulocyte lysate with the radiolabeled precursor protein. A 50-μg aliquot of freshly isolated mouse liver mitochondria was used for total cross-links and 200 μg for cross-linking and subsequent immunoprecipitation. After import, dithiobis-succinimidylpropionate (DSP) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm and incubated 30 min on ice. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with 100 mm glycin pH 8.0. Mitochondria were either analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE (total cross-linking) or solubilized in lysis buffer (15 mm Tris pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS) for 30 min on ice and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Where indicated preincubation with 10 mm EDTA and 2 mm orthophenanthrolin (o-phe) was carried out prior to import reactions for 1 h at 4 °C. Antibodies—Antisera against the C termini of human small Tim proteins (Tim9, Tim10a, Tim10b, DDP1) were raised in rabbits as described before (37Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Google Scholar). Antisera against human Tim22 were raised in rabbits using a chemically synthesized peptide (CFDPKDPYRTP-TAKE). Antibodies were affinity purified on SulfoLink gel (Pierce). Monoclonal antibody against Tim23 was purchased from BD Biosciences. The Human Mitochondrial Intermembrane Space Proteins Tim9, Tim10a, and Tim10b Are Tightly Associated with the Inner Membrane—Recently, we identified Tim9, Tim10a, and Tim10b as members of the family of small Tim proteins expressed in human mitochondria (21Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Google Scholar, 37Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Google Scholar). In order to analyze the submitochondrial location of these proteins in more detail human HeLa cell mitochondria were treated in a stepwise manner with increasing concentrations of digitonin and fractionated by centrifugation (37Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Google Scholar). The outer membrane was selectively opened at concentrations of 0.08% digitonin with more than about 50% of the soluble intermembrane space protein DDP1 in the supernatant (Fig. 1A). DDP1 was entirely released at a concentration of 0.13% digitonin; the integral inner membrane Tim23 remained in the pellet fraction (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions human Tim9, Tim10a, and Tim10b were still entirely found in the pellet fraction demonstrating that they are, in contrast to DDP1, associated with the inner membrane rather than mobile in the intermembrane space. The distribution between supernatant and pellet fraction was not influenced by whether a membrane potential across the inner membrane was present or not (data not shown). At a concentration of 0.3% digitonin Tim9, Tim10a, Tim10b, as well as the membrane protein Tim23 were released into the supernatant. To assess the strength of the membrane association, the outer membrane of mitochondria was selectively opened using 0.1% digitonin. Subsequently, the mitochondria were fractionated in the presence of high salt (500 mm NaCl) or carbonate extraction buffer (pH 11.5). About one-half of Tim9 and Tim10a was recovered in the supernatant upon high salt treatment; both proteins were completely released from the membrane upon carbonate extraction (Fig. 1B). A significant portion of Tim10b could only be released upon treatment with alkaline pH but not with high salt buffer. As expected, the integral inner membrane protein Tim23 was not extracted from the membrane by either condition (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that the human intermembrane space proteins Tim9, Tim10a, and Tim10b are, in contrast to their yeast counterparts, more tightly associated with the outer face of the inner membrane. Tim10b exhibits the highest affinity to the membrane and resembles in its behavior that of yeast Tim12. The Small Tim Proteins Are Organized in Two Distinct Complexes in Human Mitochondria—To assess the organization of Tim9, Tim10a, and Tim10b, mitochondria were lysed with 0.5% digitonin and co-immunoprecipitations were performed using affinity purified antibodies. Immunoblot analysis of precipitated material showed that antibodies against Tim9 precipitated both Tim9 and Tim10a; likewise, both proteins were precipitated using antibodies against Tim10a indicating that both proteins interact in a complex (Fig. 2). Both antibodies depleted the cognate antigen as well as their partner protein from mitochondrial extracts. Anti-Tim9 and anti-Tim10a also quantitatively precipitated Tim10b from mitochondrial extracts; whereas, anti-Tim10b only partially precipitated Tim9 and Tim10a. A fraction of Tim9 and Tim10a remained in the supernatant after precipitation (Fig. 2). Together, these results suggest the presence of two distinct hetero-oligomeric complexes in the intermembrane space. One complex consists of Tim9 and Tim10a. A second complex additionally contains Tim10b. As a rough estimation this complex accounts for about 20–30%. To assess the organization of these two complexes a gel filtration analysis was performed on a Superose-12 column. The HeLa cell mitochondria were solubilized with digitonin that preserves the TIM22 complex in yeast (16Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Google Scholar, 23Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Google Scholar). Tim10b exclusively eluted from the column in a fraction corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of ∼450 kDa (Fig. 3, A and B, left panels). In contrast, only about 30% of Tim9 and Tim10a eluted in the 450 kDa peak fractions; the remaining portion of these proteins eluted corresponding to a molecular mass ∼70 kDa. When solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, the yeast TIM22 complex destabilizes and Tim12 dissociates from Tim22. Under these conditions also the human proteins were exclusively found in the fractions corresponding to the 70-kDa species (Fig. 3, A and B, right panels). This suggests that there are two forms of 70-kDa complexes that are composed of different subunits. The Tim9-10a-10b complex is tightly associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and is part of a high molecular weight complex of 450 kDa. The majority of Tim9 and Tim10a is found in a distinct complex, Tim9-10a complex, that lacks Tim10b. The strength of the association of the Tim9-10a complex with the inner membrane appears to be weaker than that of the Tim9-10a-10b complex. Tim9, Tim10a, and Tim10b Interact with Human Tim22—In yeast, the association of the TIM9-10-12 complex with the inner membrane is mediated by an interaction between Tim12 and the membrane-integral component Tim22. Recently, we identified the human Tim22 homologue (21Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Google Scholar). Like its yeast counterpart, human Tim22 is embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane of human mitochondria. We asked whether the human small Tim proteins are in direct contact with Tim22. Human mitochondria were therefore solubilized with 0.5% digitonin and immunoprecipitations were performed with antibodies against Tim9, Tim10b, and Tim22. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated material showed that both anti-Tim9 and anti-Tim10b were able to co-precipitate Tim22 (Fig. 4). However, only a minor fraction of total Tim22 was precipitated with these antibodies whereas anti-Tim22 was able to deplete Tim22 from mitochondrial extracts. Likewise, only about 20% of each Tim9, Tim10a, and Tim10b was precipitated with antibodies against Tim22 (Fig. 4). These data indicate that the human small Tim proteins are in contact with human Tim22. However, only a small fraction of the Tim9-10a-10b complex, and maybe also of the Tim9-10a complex, appears to interact with human Tim22 in a stable manner. Thus, in human mitochondria there is no stable complex containing Tim9-10a-10b together with Tim22. These data are supported by the observation that human Tim22 is not found in the 450-kDa peak elution fraction after gel filtration (data not shown) that contains all of Tim10b and parts of Tim9 and Tim10a. The Human Small Tims Act During Import of Carrier Proteins into the Inner Membrane—We further investigated the functional role of the small Tim proteins in human mitochondria and asked whether they act during import of metabolite carriers into the inner membrane of mammalian mitochondria. Mitochondria were freshly prepared from mouse liver and energized with NADH and succinate or preincubated with valinomycin/CCCP to dissipate the membrane potential ΔΨ. Radiolabeled precursor of the human ANT3, the liver-specific isoform of the mammalian adenine nucleotide translocators, was added and import into mitochondria was quantified. In the presence of a membrane potential ΔΨ, a significant portion of human ANT3 was imported into mitochondria indicated by the band resistant to protease treatment with proteinase K (PK) (Fig. 5A). In the absence of ΔΨ, the amount of imported ANT3 was severely reduced. The import of ANT3 into mitochondria isolated from yeast cells was inefficient (data not shown). To assess the insertion of the human carrier into the inner membrane, radiolabeled ANT3 was imported into mammalian mitochondria and treated with PK after selective opening (see above) of the outer membrane. Under these conditions, most of imported ANT3 remained resistant against PK (Fig. 5B, left panel). The efficiency of membrane insertion of ANT3 into mammalian mitochondria was comparable to that of yeast AAC2 into mitochondria isolated from yeast (Fig. 5B, right panel). In contrast to yeast AAC2, ANT3 could not be clipped to a lower size fragment even at high concentrations of PK (200 μg/ml) (Fig. 5B). This might be due to the fact that ANT3 contains very short hydrophilic stretches at both termini and that these lack putative cleavage sites. To address whether the human small Tims directly interact with translocation intermediates of carriers during import into mammalian mitochondria, human ANT3 was subjected to chemical cross-linking. To accumulate translocation intermediates in the intermembrane space (stage III), mouse liver mitochondria were preincubated with valinomycin and CCCP to dissipate the membrane potential. Radiolabeled ANT3 precursor was added and cross-linking with DSP was performed. Mitochondria were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Tim9 and Tim10a. With both antibodies one specific cross-linking adduct was detected corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of about 40 kDa (Fig. 5C). This cross-link adduct was not observed when nonimmune serum was used for immunoprecipitation or when import was performed in the presence of a membrane potential ΔΨ. These data indicate that Tim9 and Tim10a are in direct contact with ANT3 precursor during import. Additionally, cross-link products of higher molecular sizes were observed when anti-Tim10a was used for precipitation. These may reflect the oligomeric organization of the small Tim proteins. The small Tim proteins of eukaryotes contain four conserved cysteine residues that constitute a metal binding site and are required for the formation of typical zinc finger structures. In yeast, the interaction of Tim10 and Tim12 with AAC2 precursors during import is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions (23Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Google Scholar). Here, we tested whether metal ions are also required during import of human carrier proteins. Mitochondria isolated from mouse liver were de-energized with valinomycin/CCCP and incubated with radiolabeled ANT3 in the presence or absence of the metal chelating agents EDTA and o-phenanthroline (o-phe). Subsequently, cross-linking with DSP was performed. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Tim9 revealed a specific cross-link adduct of about 40 kDa in the presence of divalent cations but not in their absence (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, the cross-link adduct was not observed when the import was performed in the presence of a membrane potential. Thus, metal ions are required for the interaction of the human Tim9-10a and Tim9-10a-10b complexes with ANT3 during its import into mitochondria. This dependence reflects the requirement of zinc ions for the formation of zinc finger domains of small Tim proteins. Here, we investigated the structural features and functional role of the human intermembrane space components Tim9, Tim10a, and Tim10b. They belong to the evolutionary conserved family of small Tim proteins, which in mammals additionally harbor DDP1 and Tim13 (21Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Google Scholar, 37Rothbauer U. Hofmann S. Muhlenbein N. Paschen S.A. Gerbitz K.D. Neupert W. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37327-37334Google Scholar). All these proteins share a characteristic Cys4 metal binding motif that is required for the formation of zinc finger-like structures. Based on amino acid sequence comparison, human Tim9 and Tim10a were shown to represent the homologues of yeast Tim9 and Tim10; the degrees of similarity between human and yeast components were 60 and 62%, respectively. Only the human Tim10b shows a significantly lower degree of overall similarity (∼40%) to yeast Tim9, Tim10, and Tim12. Amino acid sequence analysis could not assign human Tim10b to any of these components; it was classified as a second Tim10 homolog only on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis focusing on the Cys4 domain (21Bauer M.F. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Smith R.J. Gerbitz K. Neupert W. Brunner M. Hofmann S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 41-47Google Scholar). Thus, a clear-cut Tim12 homolog seems to be absent in mammals and other eukaryotes except S. cerevisiae. This is surprising because the yeast Tim12 fulfills a specific and essential role during the import of mitochondrial carriers that can be assumed to be conserved in higher eukaryotes (23Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Google Scholar, 25Koehler C.M. Jarosch E. Tokatlidis K. Schmid K. Schweyen R.J. Schatz G. Science. 1998; 279: 369-373Google Scholar, 26Endres M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3214-3221Google Scholar). Consequently, we asked which of the human small Tim proteins fulfill a function similar to that of yeast Tim12. We showed that the human small Tims investigated here are organized in two hetero-oligomeric complexes in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. One complex contains Tim9 and Tim10a; its apparent molecular size is about 70 kDa. The second contains Tim9, Tim10a, and Tim10b and is part of a higher molecular mass complex of about 450 kDa. About two-thirds of Tim9 and Tim10a are found in the Tim9-10a complex; while the remaining Tim9 and Tim10a is associated with Tim10b in the 450 kDa complex. In yeast, also two hetero-oligomeric complexes of different sizes are found in the intermembrane space: a TIM9-10 and a TIM9-10-12 complex. Similar to mammalian mitochondria, one complex, TIM9-10, exists in a 70-kDa form, whereas the second complex, TIM9-10-12, is part of a larger complex of 300 kDa (22Adam A. Endres M. Sirrenberg C. Lottspeich F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 313-319Google Scholar, 23Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Google Scholar, 24Koehler C.M. Merchant S. Oppliger W. Schmid K. Jarosch E. Dolfini L. Junne T. Schatz G. Tokatlidis K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6477-6486Google Scholar, 25Koehler C.M. Jarosch E. Tokatlidis K. Schmid K. Schweyen R.J. Schatz G. Science. 1998; 279: 369-373Google Scholar). Thus, the distribution of the human small Tims among the two complexes resembles that of yeast. Moreover, the data suggest that the Tim10b might be the functional homolog of yeast Tim12 since both, yeast Tim12 and human Tim10b are exclusively found in the large complexes and not in the 70-kDa complexes. Accordingly, we asked whether the human Tim10b mediates the association of the human small Tim complexes with the inner membrane in a manner similar to yeast Tim12. Indeed, Tim10b exhibits a higher membrane affinity when compared with Tim9 and Tim10a. It remained membrane associated even at high ionic strength whereas Tim9 and Tim10a were released under the same conditions. Surprisingly, Tim9 and Tim10a appear to be quantitatively associated with the outer face of the inner membrane. Thus, in contrast to yeast, the intermembrane space of mammalian mitochondria appears to lack soluble 70-kDa complexes composed of Tim9 and Tim10a. This observation was unexpected since the soluble TIM9-10 complex of yeast is thought to function as a trans-site receptor for incoming carriers still associated with the TOM complex (2Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 339-349Google Scholar, 26Endres M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3214-3221Google Scholar, 29Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 942-953Google Scholar). It escorts the hydrophobic precursors across the intermembrane space to the TIM22 translocase in the inner membrane. The function of these soluble 70-kDa complexes appears not to be essentially required for import of carriers into yeast mitochondria. In a mutant yeast strain (Δ70k) that lacks soluble TIM9-10 complexes in the intermembrane space, import of AAC into mitochondria was found 2–3-fold reduced (42Murphy M.P. Leuenberger D. Curran S.P. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6132-6138Google Scholar). However, the steady-state levels of AAC in Δ70k mitochondria remained unaffected. This Δ70k strain contains minimal levels of Tim9 and Tim10 that confer viability to the yeast cells; both proteins were found in tight association with the inner membrane. Thus, in yeast the soluble 70-kDa complexes facilitate the import of AAC although their presence is not essentially required (42Murphy M.P. Leuenberger D. Curran S.P. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6132-6138Google Scholar). It appears that their function is not conserved between lower and higher eukaryotes and import of carrier proteins into mammalian mitochondria is efficient even in the absence of the soluble 70-kDa complexes. Therefore, other mechanisms that prevent the hydrophobic carriers from aggregation in the aqueous intermembrane space must have evolved in mitochondria of higher eukaryotes. In yeast, the precursors are transferred to the putative insertion pore of the TIM22 translocase via the tightly bound TIM9-10-12 complex. We have shown that at least a small fraction of the Tim9-10a-10b, and maybe the Tim9-10a complex, is in contact with Tim22 in human mitochondria. This indicates that the human intermembrane space complexes are indeed involved in the TIM22 import pathway. These data also imply that the major portion of the Tim9-10a-10b complex is not stable associated with human Tim22. Notably, the human 450 kDa Tim9-10a-10b complex does not contain Tim22. This finding is in contrast to yeast, where all of TIM9-10-12 is found in a stable complex of 300 kDa together with Tim22, Tim54, and Tim18 (23Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Google Scholar, 25Koehler C.M. Jarosch E. Tokatlidis K. Schmid K. Schweyen R.J. Schatz G. Science. 1998; 279: 369-373Google Scholar). Based on these observations it can be speculated that human Tim9-10a-10b interacts with the membrane-integral Tim22 in a dynamic manner when the carrier precursors are transferred to the putative pore of TIM22 complex for proper insertion into the inner membrane. Furthermore, human homologues of yeast Tim54 and Tim18 appear not to be expressed in higher eukaryotes indicating that also the structural organization of the membrane-integral part of the human TIM22 complex differs remarkably from that of the fungal complex. We provided evidence that the human intermembrane space complexes are in contact with carrier precursors during import into mammalian mitochondria suggesting that they act as specific chaperones for metabolite carriers in humans. However, our data suggest that different mechanisms and specific requirements for import and insertion of carrier preproteins into the inner membrane have evolved in higher eukaryotes. This conclusion is additionally supported by the observation that the human ANT3 cannot be imported into yeast mitochondria whereas the yeast AAC is efficiently imported into mitochondria of either yeast or mammals. Furthermore, the tight membrane association of the small Tim complexes implies the development of a different mechanism that ensures the maintenance of import competence of hydrophobic carriers during their import. It remains to be clarified which further components contribute to the TIM22 import pathway and allow to fulfill the specific import requirements of the mammalian carrier proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2117871175,"Previous studies have indicated that Sp2 binds poorly to GC-rich sequences bound by Sp1 and Sp3, and further functional analyses of Sp2 have been limited. To study Sp2-mediated transcription, we employed a PCR-based protocol to determine the Sp2 consensus DNA-binding sequence (5′-GGGCGGGAC-3′) and performed kinetic experiments to show that Sp2 binds this consensus sequence with high affinity (225 pm) in vitro. To determine the functional consequence of Sp2 interaction with this sequence in vivo, we transformed well characterized Sp-binding sites within the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) promoter to consensus Sp2-binding sites. Incorporation of Sp2-binding sites within the DHFR promoter increased Sp2-mediated trans-activation in transient co-transfection experiments but also revealed Sp2 to be a relatively weak trans-activator with little or no capacity for additive or synergistic trans-activation. Using chimeric molecules prepared with portions of Sp1 and Sp2 and the human prostate-specific antigen promoter, we show that Sp2 DNA binding activity and trans-activation are negatively regulated in mammalian cells. Taken together, our data indicate that Sp2 is functionally distinct relative to other Sp family members and suggest that Sp2 may play a unique role in cell physiology.

Taken together, our data indicate that Sp2 is functionally distinct relative to other Sp family members and suggest that Sp2 may play a unique role in cell physiology. The Sp subfamily of Sp/XKLF transcription factors is composed of five members, Sp1–Sp5, that govern the expression of a wide variety of mammalian genes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Google Scholar, 2Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Google Scholar, 3Phillipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Google Scholar). Each member of the family carries a conserved carboxyl-terminal domain featuring three Cys2-His2 zinc fingers required for sequence-specific DNA binding to GC-rich promoter elements (GC-boxes). The amino acid sequences of regions outside of the DNA-binding domain are only modestly conserved between family members, yet each is structurally conserved, since their trans-activation domains feature a common series of alternating serine/threonine-rich and glutamine-rich subdomains (4Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Google Scholar). The glutamine-rich subdomains of each protein are believed to be required for trans-activation, whereas the function(s) of the serine/threonine-rich regions is less well understood. Despite their common structure and expression in most, if not all, mammalian cells, it is abundantly clear that the functions of Sp family members are not completely overlapping. For example, mice nullizygous for Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4 exhibit profound developmental abnormalities. Sp1-deficient mice perish in utero after embryonic day 10 and exhibit a broad range of developmental deficiencies. Consistent with the notion that loss of Sp1 function leads to a cell autonomous defect, Sp1-null embryonic stem cells contribute to the formation of early chimeric embryos, but their abundance diminishes rapidly after embryonic day 11, and such cells are absent in newborns (5Marin M.

Sp3-deficient embryos are growth-retarded and survive to birth, but newborn animals invariably perish due to respiratory failure. Careful examination of Sp3 nullizygotes indicates that these animals also suffer from defects in skeletal bone ossification and tooth development (6Bouwman P. Gollner H. Elsasser H.-P. Eckhoff G. Karis A. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Suske G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 655-661Google Scholar, 7Gollner H. Dani C. Phillips B. Philipsen S. Suske G. Mech. Develop. 2001; 106: 77-83Google Scholar). Mice lacking Sp4 appear to develop normally in utero, but two-thirds of newborn animals perish within 4 weeks of birth of undetermined causes (8Supp D.M. Witte D.P. Branford W.W. Smith E.P. Potter S.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 176: 284-299Google Scholar, 9Gollner H. Bouwman P. Mangold M. Karis A. Braun H. Rohner I. Del Rey A. Besedovsky H.-O. Meinhardt A. van den Broek M. Cutforth T. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Suske G. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 689-697Google Scholar). Surviving Sp4 nullizygotes are growth-retarded, male animals fail to breed despite normal spermatogenesis, and female animals exhibit a delayed onset of puberty. Although it is likely that Sp family members share some overlapping duties, these developmental results argue rather strongly that each Sp family member is responsible for unique contributions that cannot be supplanted by other family members or other GC box-binding proteins. Sp2 is a poorly characterized member of the Sp family. Cloned 10 years ago by virtue of its hybridization with a portion of the Sp1 DNA-binding domain, Sp2 was shown to be expressed in a number of disparate human cell lines, to have the least conserved DNA-binding domain among Sp family members (75%), and to bind weakly to a sequence (5′-GGTGGGTGG-3′) derived from the T-cell receptor Vα11.1 promoter (10Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have yielded few additional clues regarding Sp2 function. Sp2 has shown little or no capacity to stimulate the transcription of promoters that are activated potently by Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 (11Chen S. Artlett C.M. Jimenez S.A. Varga J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 215: 101-110Google Scholar, 12Zhao L. Chang L.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4869-4882Google Scholar, 13Rotheneder H. Geymayer S. Haidweger E. J. Mol.

However, these studies did not assess whether Sp2 can bind Sp-regulated promoter elements that are trans-activated by these additional family members. Thus, it remains unclear whether the incapacity of Sp2 to stimulate transcription springs from its inability to bind the promoters analyzed, to trans-activate, or both. In other instances, the addition of anti-Sp2 antisera to nuclear extracts has yielded sporadic evidence of the formation of Sp2 protein-DNA complexes on promoter elements regulated by other Sp family members (15Bigger C.B.

Unfortunately, these same studies did not assess the transcriptional consequence of the interaction of Sp2 with these sites in vivo. Thus, the data in hand shed little light on the functional properties of Sp2 and its role in cell physiology. As a first step toward understanding the functional properties of Sp2, we undertook a series of experiments to determine whether Sp2 is a transcriptional trans-activator and to compare its capacity to stimulate transcription with Sp1 and Sp3. Since at the outset it was unclear what DNA sequence(s) is bound with high affinity by Sp2, we began our studies by employing a PCR-mediated technique, termed SELEX or “CASTing,” to define a consensus Sp2-binding site. This consensus site was then incorporated within well characterized, Sp-regulated elements in the DHFR 1The abbreviations used are: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; SL2, Schneider line-2; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; TSA, trichostatin A. promoter, and the capacities of Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 to trans-activate this mutated promoter and a wild-type DHFR promoter were compared. Our studies identified 5′-GGGCGGGAC-3′ as the Sp2 consensus DNA-binding site, and this site is bound with high affinity (225 pm) by Sp2 in vitro. Consistent with the proposition that Sp family members have distinct DNA binding specificities, Sp1 and Sp3 bound this consensus Sp2-binding site with significantly less affinity (700 pm and 8.9 nm, respectively). Interestingly, incorporation of this consensus Sp2-binding site into one or more of the four Sp-regulated elements within the DHFR promoter led to only a modest increase in the capacity of Sp2 to stimulate transcription in vivo relative to the wild-type DHFR promoter. Moreover, overall levels of Sp2-mediated trans-activation of Sp2 site-containing promoters were 10–20-fold less than that of Sp1 and Sp3, repectively. Using chimeric Sp1/Sp2 proteins and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter, we show that Sp2 DNA binding activity and trans-activation are negatively regulated in mammalian cells. Indeed, although Sp2 is ubiquitously expressed, we show that Sp2 DNA binding activity is negligible in many human and mouse cell lines. Using a protein/protein binding assay, we also show that binding of the Sp2 trans-activation domain by a novel 84-kDa cellular protein is directly correlated with the inhibition of Sp2 DNA binding activity and trans-activation. Cell Culture—Sf9 cells were obtained from Dr. Patrick J. Casey (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC), and Drosophila Schneider line-2 (SL2) cells were obtained from Dr. Cheaptip Benyajati (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY). Sf9 and SL2 cells were cultured as previously described (23Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Google Scholar, 24Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J.

HTLA230 cells were a generous gift of Dr. Emil Bogenmann (Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA). GoTo, SKNBE(2), T98G, K562, HCT116, HUT78, and Jurkat cells were obtained from the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center cell culture facility (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). Antisera and Western Blotting—Rabbit anti-Sp2 (K-20; sc-643) polyclonal antiserum was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-V5 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Invitrogen, and a mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (anti-HA.11) was obtained from Covance Research Products (Richmond, CA). A polyclonal chicken anti-Sp2 trans-activation domain antiserum was prepared against a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Sp2 fusion protein that carries the first 496 amino acids of human Sp2. Total IgY was collected from eggs prior to and following four successive immunizations with immunogen (Aves Labs, Inc., Tigard, OR). Whole cell or nuclear extracts were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose using a semidry transfer apparatus, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected as previously described (24Kennett S.B.

Expression and Reporter Constructs—The construction and functional characterization of pPacSp1/flu, pPacSp3/flu, and pCMV4-Sp1/flu have previously been described (23Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Google Scholar, 24Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Google Scholar, 25Kennett S.B.

An Sp2 expression construct, pPacSp2/flu, carrying a 10-amino acid epitope from influenza hemagglutinin at the Sp2 carboxyl-terminus was prepared following a PCR that included a human Sp2 cDNA (a generous gift of Dr. Astar Winoto, University of California, Berkeley, CA) as template, Deep Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA), and the following primers: 5′-GGGGGATCCGCCACCATGGCGGCCGCCGTAATGAGC-3′ and 5′-GGGGGATCCCTAGCTAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACAAGTTCTTCGTGACCAG-3′. The amplified, epitope-tagged cDNA was subsequently cloned at the BamHI sites of pCMV4 to generate pCMV4-Sp2/flu and pBSK to generate pBSKSp2/flu (26Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D.R. Murata Y. Martin K.H. Humphrey P.A. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3265-3269Google Scholar). Sp1/2 chimeras were prepared using the PCR and pCMV4-Sp1/flu and pCMV4-Sp2/flu as substrates. Amino acids carried by each chimera are as follows: Sp1/2 (Sp1, 1–619; Sp2, 527–613), Sp2/1 (Sp2, 1–526; Sp1, 620–778), Sp2/1D (Sp2, 1–613; Sp1, 700–778), Sp1/2/1 (Sp1, 1–619 and 700–778; Sp2, 527–613). GST fusion proteins prepared with the entirety of the Sp1 trans-activation domain (GST-Sp1) and the amino-terminal 300 amino acids of Sp3 (GST-Sp3) have been previously described, as has GST-FSH (23Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Google Scholar, 27Murata Y. Kim H.G. Rogers K.T. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20674-20681Google Scholar). A GST-Sp2 fusion protein (GST-Sp2) carrying the entirety of the Sp2 trans-activation domain was prepared as outlined above. GST-Sp2A, GST-Sp2B, and GST-Sp2C were prepared using the PCR and pBSKSp2/flu as substrate. These partial trans-activation domain GST fusion proteins carry the following Sp2 amino acids: GST-Sp2A (amino acids 1–195), GST-Sp2B (amino acids 196–417), GST-Sp2C (amino acids 421–528). A wild-type hamster DHFR-luciferase reporter construct (DHFR-Lux) has previously been described (23Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Google Scholar, 24Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Google Scholar). DHFR-luciferase constructs carrying one or more consensus Sp2-binding sites were prepared via site-directed mutagenesis using a commercially available kit (QuikChange, Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides employed for mutagenesis were as follows: DHFR1, 5′-CTTGTGAATCGGAG-GtCcCGCCC-CAACAAGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCTTGTTG-GGGCGgGaC-CTCCGATTCACAAG-3′; DHFR2, 5′-CATCAGAG-GtCCCGCCc-CCACGAGGTCAGA-3′ and 5′-TCTGACCTCGTGG-gGGCGGGaC-CTCTGATG-3′; DHFR3, 5′-GCCTCCACGAGGTCAGA-gTCCcgCcC-CACCAGGCCGGCCCCGCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGCGGGGCCGGCCTGGTG-GgGcgGGAc-TCTGACCTCGTGGAGGC-3′; DHFR4, 5′-GAGGTCAGACTCCGCCTCCACCAGGCCG-GtCCCGCCC-AGTCCGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCGGACT-GGGCGGGaC-CGGCCTGGTGGAGGCGGAGTCTGACCTC-3′. Nucleotides in italic type correspond to Sp-binding sites targeted for mutation. Lowercase letters indicate mutated nucleotides. Successive rounds of mutagenesis were employed to generate DHFR reporter constructs with multiple consensus Sp2-binding sites. A PSA-luciferase reporter construct carrying a 5-kbp portion of the PSA promoter was a generous gift of Dr. Charles J. Bieberich (University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD) and has been previously described (28Chen H. Nandi A.K. Li X. Bieberich C. J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 338-340Google Scholar). A chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene linked to the adenovirus major late promoter, Δ53MLP-CAT, was obtained from Dr. Adrian R. Black (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY) and used as a normalization control in transient transfection experiments, since its activity is not dependent on Sp family members. A CAT reporter gene carrying three multimerized copies of a consensus Sp2-binding site (pSp2-TK-CAT) was generated using complementary synthetic oligonucleotides and a reporter gene regulated by a minimal promoter derived from the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. Baculovirus Stocks—Baculovirus stocks encoding Sp1 and Sp3 have previously been described (24Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Google Scholar). A baculovirus stock encoding Sp2 linked at its amino terminus to a V5 (Invitrogen) epitope tag was prepared via the PCR using Deep Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs), pPacSp2/flu as template, and the 5′ (5′-GGGGCCACCATGGGAAAGCCAATTCCAAATCCACTTCTTGGACTTGATAGTACAATGAGCGATCCACAGACCAGCATG-3′) and 3′ (5′-GGGGTTACAAGTTCTTCGTGACCAG-3′) primers. Following DNA amplification, this epitope-tagged cDNA was subcloned in pCR-BluntII-TOPO (Invitrogen), inserted at the XbaI and BamHI sites of pVL1392, and then transferred into the viral backbone via homologous recombination using a commercially available kit (BaculoGold) and methods supplied by the manufacturer (Pharmingen). Transient Transfections—Transient transfections of SL2 cells for transcription assays were performed essentially as previously described (23Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Google Scholar, 24Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared for luciferase and CAT assays 48 h after transfection. The Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Inc.) was employed to quantify luciferase activity precisely as recommended by the manufacturer. Luminescence was detected in a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany), and results were normalized to the abundance of Δ53MLP-CAT activity. To prepare Drosophila SL2 extracts for Western blotting, transient transfections were performed using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany). Transient transfections of mammalian cells were also performed using Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection. Oligonucleotide Probes—Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an automated DNA synthesizer, deprotected, and partially purified through Sephadex G-25 spin columns. Radiolabeled probes for standard and quantitative protein/DNA binding assays were prepared from six double-stranded 60-mers, each carrying a single promoter-derived Sp-binding site flanked by common nucleotide sequences. The promoter-derived sequences utilized for these experiments are as follows: p21, 5′-CCCGCCTCCT-3′ (25Kennett S.B. Moorefield K.S. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9780-9789Google Scholar); MDR-1, 5′-CGCCGGGGCGTGGGC-3′ (25Kennett S.B. Moorefield K.S. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9780-9789Google Scholar); DHFR1, 5′-AGGGCGTGGC-3′ (29Swick A.G. Blake M.C. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9291-9304Google Scholar); DHFR2, 5′-GAGGCGGGGC-3′ (29Swick A.G. Blake M.C. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9291-9304Google Scholar); DHFR3, 5′-GAGGCGGAGT-3′ (29Swick A.G. Blake M.C. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9291-9304Google Scholar); DHFR4, 5′-TGGGCGGGGC-3′ (29Swick A.G. Blake M.C. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9291-9304Google Scholar). A c-fos-derived oligonucleotide (5′-Fos-4; 5′-CCCTTGCGCCACCCCTCT-3′) employed to normalize DNA binding activities has been previously described (30Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Horowitz J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 597-608Google Scholar). Annealed, complementary oligonucleotides were radiolabeled and purified as previously described (24Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Google Scholar, 30Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Horowitz J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 597-608Google Scholar). Protein/DNA and Protein/Protein Binding Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared using methods described by Lee et al. (31Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Google Scholar). Standard protein/DNA binding assays were performed as previously described, and complexes were visualized by autoradiography (24Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Google Scholar, 30Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Horowitz J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 597-608Google Scholar). For quantitative protein/DNA binding assays, whole cell protein extracts prepared from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were incubated with a radiolabeled probe derived from the c-fos promoter (5′-CCCTTGCGCCACCCCTCT-3′) (30Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Horowitz J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 597-608Google Scholar), and resulting protein-DNA complexes were quantified in situ using an InstantImager (Packard, Inc.). Volumes of infected cell extracts that led to half-maximal binding of this probe were then employed in assays performed in triplicate with Sp-binding sites derived from the DHFR, p21, and MDR-1 genes and quantified in situ. GST fusion proteins were induced, purified, quantified, and utilized as previously described (24Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Google Scholar, 25Kennett S.B. Moorefield K.S. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9780-9789Google Scholar, 27Murata Y. Kim H.G. Rogers K.T. Udvadia A.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9281-9288Google Scholar, 34Sterner J.M. Tao Y. Kennett S.B. Kim H.G. Horowitz J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 53-64Google Scholar). Derivation of a Consensus Sp2-binding Site—A consensus Sp2-binding site was determined as previously described except for the incorporation of an anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) to immunoprecipitate protein-DNA complexes (32Tao Y. Kassatly R.F. Cress W.D. Horowitz J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6994-7007Google Scholar). Equilibrium Dissociation Constant (Kd) Determination—Calculations of Kd values were performed by a standard procedure. Briefly, dilutions of cell extracts prepared from Sp2 baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were incubated with 200 pmol of radiolabeled oligonucleotide until a volume of cell extract was identified that complexed with 50% of the input probe. The abundance of free probe and Sp2 protein-DNA complexes was quantified in situ using an InstantImager (Packard). To ensure that Sp2-binding sites were limiting under these conditions, additional protein/DNA binding assays were performed with 5-fold increasing and decreasing amounts of radiolabeled probe. An excess of infected cell extract was then assayed with 200 pmol of radiolabeled probe and increasing amounts of unlabeled homologous competitor DNA. The concentration of unlabeled oligonucleotide that led to 50% occupancy of the radiolabeled probe was determined by quantification in situ, and this concentration was halved to determine the amount of active Sp2 in diluted protein extracts. This value was then divided by the original extract dilution factor to derive the equilibrium dissociation constant. Indirect Immunofluorescence—One day prior to transfection, 2 × 105 COS-1 cells were plated onto glass coverslips in 6-well plates and incubated at 37 °C. Cells were cultured for 48 h following transfection, and all subsequent procedures were performed at room temperature. Coverslips were transferred to 60-mm tissue culture dishes, and cells were washed for 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on a rotating platform. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde plus PBS for 15 min and then washed for 5 min with PBS. Cells were subsequently permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 plus PBS for 60 min and then incubated for an additional 60 min in 1% fetal bovine serum plus PBS. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (diluted 1:500 in 1% BSA plus PBS) for 60 min and then washed three times for 5 min each in PBS on a rotating platform. Cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) diluted 1:500 in 1% BSA plus PBS containing DAPI (diluted 1:50,000) for 60 min and then washed three times for 5 min each in PBS on a rotating platform. Following a single 5-min wash in distilled H2O, coverslips were mounted on glass microscope slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA), sealed with clear nail polish, and viewed using a Nikon TE-200 inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate optics and filter blocks at a magnification of × 100 under oil immersion. Results were recorded with a digital camera (SPOT, Jr.; Diagnostics Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) and proprietary software using the manufacturer's instructions. Sp2 Is a Relatively Weak trans-Activator of the Hamster DHFR Promoter in Vivo—To begin to analyze Sp2 function, we compared its capacity to stimulate the transcription of DHFR, a well characterized target of Sp-mediated transcription, with that of Sp1 and Sp3 in Drosophila SL2 cells (23Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Google Scholar, 24Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Google Scholar, 29Swick A.G. Blake M.C. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9291-9304Google Scholar). SL2 cells are a convenient milieu for such studies, since they lack transcription factors closely related to Sp family members although they support Sp-mediated transcription. A full-length, human Sp2 cDNA was subcloned in an insect cell expression vector (pPac), and this construct or analogous constructions carrying Sp1 (pPacSp1/flu) or Sp3 (pPacSp3/flu) cDNAs were transiently co-transfected with a DHFR-luciferase reporter gene (DHFR-Lux) (25Kennett S.B. Moorefield K.S. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9780-9789Google Scholar). Four Sp-regulated elements (termed DHFR1–DHFR4) have previously been identified and characterized within the 170-base pair portion of the DHFR promoter carried by DHFR-Lux. As we have previously reported, Sp1 and Sp3 stimulated DHFR transcription between 130- and 300-fold over the range of input DNA concentrations examined (Fig. 1A) (23Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Google Scholar, 24Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Google Scholar). In contrast, Sp2-directed transcription was significantly weaker, ranging between 4- and 20-fold over baseline DHFR-Lux activity. This relatively modest level of trans-activation was obtained despite the inclusion of up to a 64-fold molar excess of Sp2 DNA compared with Sp1 or Sp3. Western blotting with an anti-Sp2 polyclonal antiserum indicated that Sp2 was expressed abundantly in transfected cells and at levels comparable with that of other Sp proteins expressed in this setting (Fig. 1B, lane 2, and data not shown). We conclude from these titration experiments that Sp2 is a relatively weak trans-activator of DHFR transcription in SL2 cells. Sp2 Binds Relatively Weakly to Sp-regulated Promoter Elements within the DHFR Promoter—Given that the DNA-binding domain of Sp2 is only 75% identical to that of Sp1 and Sp3, we speculated that this significant structural difference might account for Sp2's relatively modest stimulation of DHFR transcription; i.e. we reasoned that amino acid differences within the DNA-binding domain of Sp2 may induce it to bind fewer Sp-regulated elements within the DHFR promoter and/or bind them less efficiently than Sp1 and Sp3. To test this hypothesis, we prepared a recombinant baculovirus stock that expresses full-length human Sp2 protein in infected insect cells and compared its DNA binding activity with that of Sp1 and Sp3 as we have recently reported (25Kennett S.B.

To facilitate detection of this recombinant protein, we incorporated a 14-amino acid V5 epitope tag at the Sp2 amino terminus.

https://openalex.org/W1986424384,"The neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family of Ca2+-binding proteins regulates a number of different processes in neurons and photoreceptor cells. The first of these proteins to be characterized, recoverin, was shown to exhibit a Ca2+/myristoyl switch whereby its N-terminal myristoyl group is sequestered in the Ca2+-free form and is exposed on Ca2+ binding to allow the protein to become membrane-associated. It has subsequently been shown that certain other family members also exhibit this mechanism in living cells. In contrast, NCS-1 does not show the Ca2+/myristoyl switch and is membrane-associated even at low Ca2+ concentrations. We have used sequence comparison combined with information from structural analyses to attempt to identify candidate residues within the NCS proteins that determine whether or not the Ca2+/myristoyl switch operates in cells and have tested their functional significance by mutagenesis. The results show that NCS-1 possesses residues within its N terminus that lock the myristoyl group in an exposed conformation. In addition, other structural aspects within the C-terminal domains are required to allow the switch to operate. We have determined a key role for residues within the motif EELTRK in NCS-1 in keeping the myristoyl group exposed and allowing the protein to be constitutively membrane-associated.

They each contain four EF-hands, but only two or three of these are functional in Ca2+ binding. There are 14 NCS proteins encoded in the human genome including recoverin, GCAP1-3, KChIP1-4, VILIP1-3, neurocalcin δ, hippocalcin, and NCS-1 (2Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Google Scholar). Orthologues of these proteins appeared at various stages of evolution, but NCS-1 (also known as frequenin) is the earliest member of this family being represented in yeast (3Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q.

The significance of myristoylation was initially studied for recoverin through analysis of structures of recoverin in the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound forms (17Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Google Scholar, 18Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Google Scholar, 19Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30909-30913Google Scholar). The myristoyl group is sequestered in the Ca2+-free state within a hydrophobic pocket consisting in part of the first EF-hand, which cannot bind Ca2+. On binding of Ca2+ to EF-hands 2 and 3, a considerable conformational change is triggered in recoverin that flips out the myristoyl group. This so-called Ca2+/myristoyl switch would allow recoverin to become reversibly associated with membranes via the myristoyl group in response to [Ca2+] elevation. The hydrophobic residues that contact the myristoyl group in the recoverin structure are conserved in all of the family members, but surprisingly not all NCS proteins show the Ca2+/myristoyl switch mechanism. This property has been demonstrated for neurocalcin δ (22Ivings L. Pennington S.R. Jenkins R. Weiss J.L. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 599-608Google Scholar, 23O'Callaghan D.W. Ivings L.

In contrast, NCS-1 binds to membranes even in the nominal absence of Ca2+ (28McFerran B.W. Weiss J.L. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30258-30265Google Scholar) and is membrane-associated in cells even at low Ca2+ levels (23O'Callaghan D.W. Ivings L. Weiss J.L. Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol.

From structural studies using nuclear magnetic resonance, the yeast orthologue of NCS-1, frequenin, appears to have its myristoyl group exposed even in the Ca2+-free state (4Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Google Scholar). As NCS-1/frequenin is the member of the family that appeared first during evolution, this suggests that the Ca2+/myristoyl switch was a later evolutionary development in this family of proteins. Other NCS proteins, the KChIPs (11An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Bett M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Google Scholar), that appeared only in fish also do not have a Ca2+/myristoyl switch. The only KChIP to be myristoylated, KChIP1, is also membrane-associated at low [Ca2+] (31O'Callaghan D.W. Hasdemir B. Leighton M. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4833-4845Google Scholar). GCAP2 was suggested to have a reversed Ca2+/myristoyl switch being membrane-bound at low [Ca2+] and dissociating as [Ca2+] is elevated (32Oleshevskaya E.V. Hughes E.E. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14327-14333Google Scholar), although more recently it has been shown that both GCAP1 and GCAP2 lack the Ca2+/myristoyl switch (33Hwang J.-Y. Koch K.-W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 111-117Google Scholar, 34Hwang J.-Y. Koch K.-W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13021-13028Google Scholar). NCS-1 does undergo a conformational change on Ca2+ binding (6McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Google Scholar, 35Cox J.A. Drussel I. Comte M. Nef S. Nef P. Lenz S.E. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32807-32814Google Scholar), but the exact nature of this is unknown as the only detailed structures solved so far are for the Ca2+-bound forms of myristoylated yeast frequenin (4Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Google Scholar) and non-myristoylated human NCS-1 (36Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Google Scholar). Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the Ca2+-free form of yeast frequenin did not reveal an unambiguous structure. The structures of the Ca2+-bound forms of NCS-1/frequenin are very similar to those of Ca2+-bound recoverin (17Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Google Scholar) and neurocalcin δ (37Vijay-Kumar S. Kumar V.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 80-88Google Scholar) and do not provide any immediate clues about the basis for the lack of a Ca2+/myristoyl switch in NCS-1. Using hippocalcin and NCS-1 as green fluorescent protein variant-tagged proteins we have characterized their behavior in living cells (23O'Callaghan D.W. Ivings L. Weiss J.L. Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14227-14237Google Scholar, 31O'Callaghan D.W. Hasdemir B. Leighton M. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4833-4845Google Scholar). These two proteins have 60% identity and associate with the same intracellular membranes, but only hippocalcin does so in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The membrane association of hippocalcin and NCS-1 both in cells (23O'Callaghan D.W. Ivings L. Weiss J.L. Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14227-14237Google Scholar) and in vitro (27Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K. Saitoh S. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18898-18904Google Scholar) is dependent on their myristoylation, and the myristoylated N terminus alone is sufficient for membrane association and targeting (31O'Callaghan D.W. Hasdemir B. Leighton M. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4833-4845Google Scholar). We have now set out to determine which residues within their sequences determine whether or not the Ca2+/myristoyl switch can operate in living cells. These studies identify structural features in the N-terminal domain of NCS-1 that prevent sequestration of the myristoyl group in the Ca2+-free state and suggest that additional features in C-terminal parts of the molecule are also required to allow the exposure of the myristoyl group through conformational changes on Ca2+ binding. Plasmids—The hippocalcin-EYFP fusion construct (pHippo-EYFP) and the NCS-1-ECFP fusion construct (pNCS-1-ECFP) were as described previously (23O'Callaghan D.W. Ivings L. Weiss J.L. Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14227-14237Google Scholar) and were used as the basis for all other constructs. Specific mutations described under “Results” were made using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The hippocalcin-NCS-1 chimeric fusion constructs pHippo(1,2)NCS-1(3,4)-ECFP and pNCS-1(1,2)Hippo(3,4)-EYFP were made in two stages. The first stage used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a SpeI site at 273 bp after the start of translation of both NCS-1 in pNCS-1-ECFP and hippocalcin in pHippo-EYFP. The primers used were 5′-CCAGGCTCTATCGGTGACTAGTAGGGGGACCCTGGATGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCATCCAGGGTCCCCCTACTAGTCACCGATAGAGCCTGG-3′ (antisense) for NCS-1 and 5′-ATCGCTCTGAGCGTGACTAGTCGTGGCCGCCTGGAGCAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTGCTCCAGGCGGCCACGACTAGTCACGCTCAGAGCGAT-3′ (antisense) for hippocalcin. This made the mutant constructs pNCS-1SpeI-ECFP and pHippoSpeI-EYFP. The second stage was to digest both mutated constructs with SpeI/NdeI and to ligate the ∼300-bp fragment from pHippoSpeI-EYFP into the larger fragment from pNCS-1SpeI-ECFP to create pHippo(1,2)NCS-1(3,4)-ECFP and the ∼300-bp fragment from pNCS-1SpeI-ECFP into the larger fragment from pHippoSpeI-EYFP to create pNCS-1(1,2)Hippo(3,4)-EYFP. The chimeric fusion constructs pHippo(1)NCS-1(2,3,4)-EYFP and pNCS-1(1)Hippo(2,3,4)-ECFP were made as follows. Firstly, a BamHI site was introduced at 150 bp after the start of translation of both NCS-1 in pNCS-1SpeI-ECFP and hippocalcin in pHippoSpeI-EYFP. The primers used were 5′-CAGTTCTTCCCATTTGGGGATCCCACCAAGTTCGCCACGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGTGGCGAACTTGGTGGGATCCCCAAATGGGAAGAACTG-3′ (antisense) for NCS-1 and 5′-AACTTCTTCCCCTACGGGGATCCCTCCAAGTTCGCCGAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTCGGCGAACTTGGAGGGATCCCCGTAGGGGAAGAAGTT-3′ (antisense) for hippocalcin. The second stage was to digest both mutated constructs pNCS-1BamHI/SpeI-ECFP and pHippoBamHI/SpeI-EYFP with BamHI and to ligate the ∼450-bp fragment from pNCS-1BamHI/SpeI-ECFP into the larger fragment from pHippoBamHI/SpeI-EYFP in the sense orientation to create pHippo(1)NCS-1(2,3,4)-EYFP. To create pNCS-1(1)Hippo(2,3,4)-ECFP, the ∼450-bp fragment from pHippoBamHI/SpeI-EYFP was ligated into the larger fragment from pNCS-1BamHI/SpeI-ECFP in the sense orientation. The sequences of all the constructs were confirmed using automated DNA sequencing by Oswel (Southampton, United Kingdom). Culture and Transfection of HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were maintained in 75-cm2 culture flasks in 20 ml of growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cultures were split twice/week to prevent cells reaching confluence. For transfections, cells were plated onto glass coverslips in a 24-well plate at 40,000 cells/well or in a 6-well plate at 200,000 cells/well as required. The cells were allowed 4-24 h to adhere before they were transfected. The transfection reaction mixture contained 93 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 3 μl of FuGENE™ (Roche Applied Science), and 4 μl of plasmid DNA (250 μg/μl). This was incubated at room temperature for 30 min before being added dropwise to HeLa cells in a 24-well plate. The cells were maintained for 16-96 h before being used in experiments. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy of Live and Fixed Cells—For confocal laser scanning microscopy, live or fixed (23O'Callaghan D.W. Ivings L. Weiss J.L. Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14227-14237Google Scholar) transfected HeLa cells were examined with a Leica TCS-SP-MP microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) using a 22-μm pinhole and a ×63 water immersion objective with a 1.2 numerical aperture. For optimal imaging of the spatial distribution of EYFP constructs, the cells were excited at 514 nm, and light was collected at 525-575 nm. For ECFP, the cells were excited at 430 nm, and light was collected at 450-500 nm. The excitation laser was set at 10% power. For imaging the effects of ionomycin treatment, transfected HeLa cells were washed three times in Krebs-Ringer buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were then mounted in a bath containing 450 μl of Krebs-Ringer buffer with 3 mm CaCl2 on the confocal microscope. Image recording of the cell was begun, and after the resting state was documented, 50 μl of Krebs-Ringer buffer with 3 mm CaCl2 and 30 μm ionomycin were added to the bath giving a final ionomycin concentration in the bath of 3 μm. Images were captured at 1.86 s/frame, exported as Tiff files, and compiled in CorelDraw. Sequence and Structure Analysis—Sequences of NCS protein family members from GenBank™ were aligned using the ClustalW alignment procedure within BioEdit version 5.0.9 (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) (38Hall T.A. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 95-98Google Scholar). The structure of human NCS-1 derived from the Protein Data Bank file was rendered in ViewerLite™ 4.2 (Accelrys Inc.). The existence of the Ca2+/myristoyl switch in hippocalcin but not in NCS-1 could be due either to the presence of structural features in NCS-1 that inhibit sequestration of the myristoyl group in the Ca2+-free form or features that appeared in later NCS proteins that are needed for myristoyl group sequestration. Additional features could also be important to drive the Ca2+-dependent conformational change, due to Ca2+ binding to EF-hands 2-4, through to the N terminus. To begin to define the requirements for the existence of a Ca2+/myristoyl switch, we examined sequence alignments of mammalian NCS-1, yeast frequenin, and six of the human NCS proteins that have been shown to have a Ca2+/myristoyl switch, VILIP1-3, neurocalcin δ, hippocalcin, and recoverin. Amino acids were highlighted that are conserved in yeast and human NCS-1 but not in the other NCS proteins (shown in yellow in Fig. 1) or alternatively that are conserved in the NCS proteins with a Ca2+/myristoyl switch but not in NCS-1 or yeast frequenin (shown in red in Fig. 1). Residues that are conserved in all of these NCS proteins are outlined in blue. Fig. 1 also indicates the position of the hydrophobic residues that are required to contact the myristoyl group as shown from the structure of Ca2+-free myristoylated recoverin (18Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Google Scholar). These 14 residues are either fully conserved or replaced with other hydrophobic residues in all of the proteins including NCS-1, and so the presence or absence of these cannot contribute to the lack of the Ca2+/myristoyl switch in NCS-1. As all of the proteins must have evolved from an NCS-1-like protein it was hypothesized that all NCS proteins that have the switch must share the residues that are required for it to operate and that these would be different in NCS-1. Alternatively, residues conserved in only NCS-1 and yeast frequenin might be ones that prevent the operation of the switch. These two possibilities were tested by mutagenesis of hippocalcin-EYFP and NCS-1-ECFP and examination of the effects of these mutations on their localization and Ca2+-dependent translocation to membranes in transfected HeLa cells, aspects of their function that are dependent on their myristoyl groups. Likely significant residues as targets for mutagenesis were selected from those identified in Fig. 1 by examining the conserved residues for significant changes in charge, hydrophobicity, or size (residues marked by asterisks). Interestingly, all of the residues selected in this way were found in the crystal structure of NCS-1 to lie across the boundary between the N- and C-terminal parts of the molecule (Fig. 2) where considerable conformational change occurs in recoverin on Ca2+ binding. Differences between NCS-1/frequenin and other NCS proteins at the extreme C terminus (Fig. 1) seemed unlikely to be significant as this region is not involved in conformational changes that underlie the Ca2+/myristoyl switch in recoverin (17Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Google Scholar). The first set of mutations were introduced into hippocalcin-EYFP to see whether the corresponding NCS-1 residues could inhibit the Ca2+/myristoyl switch. Two pairs of selected mutations (A53K plus N54Q and R97T plus Q99E) were introduced both individually and in combination. Wild-type hippocalcin-EYFP expressed in HeLa cells is cytosolic at resting Ca2+ concentration and translocates to membrane structures identified as the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane when [Ca2+] is elevated by ionomycin treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). This requires myristoylation as mutation of the glycine at position 2 to alanine to prevent myristoylation abolishes the translocation (Fig. 3, C and D). The three constructs bearing the mutations separately or together behaved the same as the wild-type protein (Table I and Fig. 3, E and F) indicating that these NCS-1 residues could not prevent the switch mechanism from operating.Fig. 3The requirement for myristoylation and the effect of mutagenesis of hippocalcin or NCS-1 on localization and Ca2+-dependent translocation.

In transfected HeLa cells, NCS-1-ECFP is already fully membrane-associated at resting [Ca2+] (Fig. 3G) or even when [Ca2+] is depleted (23O'Callaghan D.W. Ivings L. Weiss J.L. Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14227-14237Google Scholar). Again this requires myristoylation as the G2A mutant of NCS-1 shows a cytoplasmic localization at both resting and elevation Ca2+ levels (Fig. 3, I and J). A series of eight residues selected from the alignments in Fig. 1 based on the properties of the amino acids were mutated alone or in combination into NCS-1-ECFP (Table I). The localization of the constructs in HeLa cells was examined to see whether the mutations affected the membrane association of NCS-1 due to changes in the exposure of the myristoyl group. Even when all eight mutations were introduced the behavior of NCS-1-ECFP was unaffected, and the ECFP fusion proteins remained on the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane in resting conditions (Fig. 3H). This shows that mutation of these residues to those conserved in NCS proteins with the Ca2+/myristoyl switch did not allow sequestration of the myristoyl group by NCS-1 in the Ca2+-free state. Despite using a logical approach through analysis of conserved and divergent residues no evidence was obtained that any of the residues highlighted in this way had any role in determining the existence or otherwise of the Ca2+/myristoyl switch. An alternative strategy was used, therefore, based on swapping large domains between hippocalcin and NCS-1 (Fig. 4). The proteins were divided by introduction of silent restriction endonuclease sites in their fusion constructs. The fusion constructs were then restriction-digested, and the domains were swapped around to create tagged chimeric hippocalcin-NCS-1 constructs. These were expressed in HeLa cells to see which domains were required for cytosolic distribution at resting [Ca2+] and for Ca2+-dependent translocation (Fig. 4). Only wild-type hippocalcin could undergo Ca2+-dependent translocation, but the chimeric proteins had two distinct localizations. The proteins with the N terminus and N-terminal EF-hand 1 of hippocalcin were all cytosolic at resting [Ca2+] (Fig. 4, A and C), whereas those with the N terminus of NCS-1 were localized to membranes in unstimulated cells (Fig. 4, E and G). The construct containing half of each parent protein showed a modification of its localization with it being entirely plasma membrane-associated (Fig. 4E). Constructs that possessed the N terminus and EF-hand 1 of hippocalcin and either two or three of the C-terminal EF-hands of NCS-1 were unable to translocate from the cytosol to membranes in response to [Ca2+] elevation (Fig. 4, B and D). These findings suggest that two aspects contribute to the Ca2+/myristoyl switch. First, differences in the N terminus and EF-hand 1 domain of hippocalcin and NCS-1 determine the ability of the proteins to sequester the myristoyl group in the Ca2+-free state and thereby determine whether the protein is cytosolic or membrane-bound at resting [Ca2+]. Second, other residues in the C-terminal part of hippocalcin must be required to allow transmission of the conformational change on Ca2+ binding to allow the myristoyl group to be ejected and for the switch to operate. The second aspect may be determined by residues spread throughout the C-terminal half of the proteins, but candidate residues in this region were not apparent from our mutagenic analysis of conserved and divergent residues. We therefore concentrated on determining which residues within the N-terminal domain contribute to the locking of the myristoyl group in an open conformation in NCS-1. Comparison of the N-terminal domains that were swapped in the chimeric proteins indicated that the residues differ in 24 positions (Fig. 5). Two areas within the N terminus covering residues 12-19 and 44-49 differed substantially between NCS-1 and hippocalcin (Fig. 5). Of particular interest appeared to be the two acid (Glu-14 and Glu-15) and two basic (Arg-18 and Lys-19) residues (in the EELTRK motif of region 1) situated close to each other. Examination of the crystal structure of NCS-1 indicated that these residues in helix A, which joins the myristoyl tail to EF-hand 1, would allow significant structural interactions in NCS-1 that would not occur in hippocalcin (Fig. 6). For this reason the residues in this motif were chosen for mutagenesis. A hippocalcin-EYFP construct was made with five mutations (hippocalcin (Q14E, D15E, R17T, E18R, and N19K)) to convert QDLREN to EELTRK. When expressed in HeLa cells this construct differed from wild-type hippocalcin as it was membrane-associated (on the trans-Golgi network and plasma membrane) even at resting Ca2+ concentration, and its localization was not affected by Ca2+ elevation (Fig. 5, A and B). This localization was dependent on its myristoylation as the G2A mutation in this construct prevented membrane association at either resting or elevated Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 5, C and D). These data are consistent with the mutations in residues 14-19 preventing sequestration of the myristoyl group by hippocalcin so that the behavior of this mutant was now the same as that of NCS-1. It was decided, therefore, to also mutate residues in this motif in NCS-1 to those found in hippocalcin. Mutation of TRK to REN in NCS-1 (NCS-1 (T17R, R18E, K19N)-ECFP) was sufficient to result in sequestration of the myristoyl group as the expressed construct was now cytosolic (Fig. 5E). This did not, however, reconstruct the Ca2+/myristoyl switch as this protein did not translocate to membranes in response to Ca2+ elevation (Fig. 5F). In contrast, introduction of the same mutations into the chimera NCS-1(1)Hippo(2,3,4)-ECFP possessing the N terminus of NCS-1 and the C-terminal three-quarters of hippocalcin (that otherwise did not translocate in response to Ca2+, Fig. 4) reconstituted the Ca2+/myristoyl switch in this protein (Fig. 5). This allowed it to translocate from the cytosol to membranes in response to Ca2+ elevation (Fig. 5, G and H). The translocation to membranes following Ca2+ elevation was dependent on its myristoylation as the introduction of the G2A mutation in this construct resulted in the protein remaining cytosolic (Fig. 5, I and J). Mutation of residues in divergent region 2 of the N terminus (QLDA to ILNV) in the same chimera had no effect (Table I, bottom line). This confirms that the presence of the TRK residues is sufficient to lock open the myristoyl group in an open conformation and that additional features within the C terminus of hippocalcin allow the Ca2+/myristoyl switch to operate.Fig. 6The structure of NCS-1 indicating the residues within the EELTRK motif.

Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Google Scholar, 18Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Google Scholar) lead to the concept of the Ca2+/myristoyl switch for reversible exposure of the N-terminal myristoyl group following Ca2+ binding and subsequent membrane attachment. Originally it was assumed that this mechanism would also operate in all other NCS proteins as they all possess the hydrophobic pocket required for myristoyl group sequestration. Some other NCS proteins do indeed show the Ca2+/myristoyl switch in vitro and in living cells, but others do not, the best characterized being NCS-1. We have now established that the lack of the switch in NCS-1 is determined in part by key residues within its N terminus that must lock the myristoyl group in an open conformation. The experimental approach we have used to examine the Ca2+/myristoyl switch and thereby myristoyl group exposure has been to examine the localization in resting and high Ca2+ conditions of NCS-1-ECFP and hippocalcin-EYFP constructs in living cells. The evidence available indicates that this is a good indicator of myristoyl-dependent membrane interactions. Previous work on the NCS protein S-modulin suggested that its membrane binding in vitro was dependent on a series of C-terminal basic residues (39Matsuda S. Hisatomi O. Tokunga F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1310-1315Google Scholar). This does not apply to NCS-1 or hippocalcin as they do not possess this charged domain. In any case, the cellular role of the basic residues in S-modulin is unclear as membrane binding via this mechanism is inhibited at physiological ionic strength (39Matsuda S. Hisatomi O. Tokunga F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1310-1315Google Scholar). This highlights the need to examine membrane association in intact living cells. Furthermore, membrane binding by hippocalcin in vitro (27Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K. Saitoh S. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18898-18904Google Scholar) and in vivo (23O'Callaghan D.W. Ivings L. Weiss J.L. Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14227-14237Google Scholar) has an essential requirement for its myristoylation, and short N-terminal myristoylation motifs (11-14 residues) of the NCS proteins are sufficient not only for membrane binding but also for specific targeting to distinct organelles (31O'Callaghan D.W. Hasdemir B. Leighton M. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4833-4845Google Scholar). In addition, we have provided data showing that mutation of glycine at position 2 to alanine, which will prevent myristoylation of the expressed proteins, results in both NCS-1 and hippocalcin being cytosolic at resting and elevated Ca2+ concentration. The essential requirements for myristoylation in membrane association were also confirmed by analysis of G2A mutations in key mutant constructs. NCS-1 appeared first during evolution, and an orthologue is present in yeast (3Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Google Scholar). At some stage new members of the family evolved from an ancestral form that allowed expression of the Ca2+/myristoyl switch mechanism. We suggest that this would require changes in amino acids within the N-terminal domain to prevent the locking of this domain in an open conformation with the myristoyl group exposed in both the Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free forms. In addition, our data suggest that other structural changes would be required to allow the conformational change following Ca2+ binding in EF-hands 2-4 to be transmitted to the N terminus of the protein to allow the myristoyl group to flip out. The latter suggestion stems from the inability of the chimeric constructs with the hippocalcin N terminus and C-terminal domains of NCS-1 to show the Ca2+/myristoyl switch. Even though these proteins were cytosolic at resting [Ca2+] they could not translocate to membranes when Ca2+ was elevated. This was not due to some structural problem derived from the splicing together of domains from the two proteins; the NCS-1(1)Hippo(2,3,4)-ECFP chimera became cytosolic and the Ca2+/myristoyl switch was reconstituted when the key TRK residues were mutated in the N terminus. Our logical approach to studying the amino acids that would determine the existence of the Ca2+/myristoyl switch by analysis of conserved and divergent residues in human NCS-1, Saccharomyces cerevisiae frequenin, and other NCS proteins followed by mutagenesis failed to identify key amino acids based on their mutagenesis. This type of approach has been advocated previously for the identification of function-specific residues (40Casari G. Sander C. Valencia A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 171-178Google Scholar, 41Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 342-358Google Scholar) but also failed to identify key residues in effector interactions in a recent study of small GTP-binding proteins (42Heo W.D. Meyer T. Cell. 2003; 113: 315-328Google Scholar). Examination of conserved and differing residues in human NCS-1 and S. cerevisiae frequenin may have been misleading; both are likely to have diverged from the putative ancestral form of the protein, and it is unclear what would be the exact nature of the ancestral protein of the NCS family. Indeed, around the key motif that was identified (EELTRK) in human NCS-1 the sequence of NCS-1 orthologues is variable until the sequence became fixed and invariable from Amphibia onwards (see Fig. 3 in Ref. 2Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Google Scholar). In addition, although it has been suggested that S. cerevisiae frequenin may not have a Ca2+/myristoyl switch this has not been rigorously tested in live cells as is the case for NCS-1. Further insight was generated from domain-swapping experiments. These demonstrated that a region consisting of the N terminus and first EF-hand domain determined whether the myristoyl group could or could not be sequestered in the Ca2+-free form of the protein based on whether the expressed proteins were cytosolic or membrane-bound. The data also suggested that additional elements in the C-terminal domains are required for the switch to operate in response to Ca2+. For the determination of the basis for the difference in myristoyl group sequestration, sequence comparison between NCS-1 and hippocalcin highlighted divergent residues at positions 12-19, and analysis of the NCS structure (Fig. 6) suggested that these could be functionally significant. Mutagenesis of residues at these positions in both hippocalcin and NCS-1 modified, in opposite directions, the ability of the proteins to sequester the myristoyl group and thereby whether they were cytosolic or membrane-bound at resting Ca2+ concentration. The identification of key residues at positions 12-19 is consistent with structural considerations. In the crystal structure of human NCS-1 (36Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Google Scholar) the two acidic (Glu-14 and Glu-15) and the two basic (Arg-18 and Lys-19) residues are exposed on the same surface of an N-terminal helix where they are close enough to interact directly (Fig. 6). We propose that the hydrogen bonding between these residues would stabilize the helix in a rigid conformation that could keep the N terminus of NCS-1 in an open conformation with the myristoyl group exposed. In support of this idea, the motif at positions 12-19 is not present in any of the NCS proteins that demonstrate the Ca2+/myristoyl switch, and the alternative residues present in these proteins would not allow similar stabilization. No indication of similar interactions within the N-terminal helix is apparent in the structures of recoverin or neurocalcin δ that do have a Ca2+/myristoyl switch. GCAP2 has been established not to have shown Ca2+/myristoyl switch. Interestingly, a potentially similar mechanism to that we postulate for NCS-1 could be envisaged in GCAP2 through the interaction of Glu-26 and -33 and Lys-29 and -30 within its N-terminal helix. It seems likely, therefore, that changes in the N terminus are among those that occurred during the evolution of the NCS protein family to allow the Ca2+/myristoyl switch to operate. These findings help explain, therefore, why NCS-1 does not demonstrate the Ca2+/myristoyl switch. The yeast orthologue is also unlikely to possess the Ca2+/myristoyl switch, but the residues in positions 12-19 differ from those in NCS-1. It is possible that as NCS proteins with the Ca2+/myristoyl switch appeared in higher organisms the sequence of NCS-1 became invariable to maintain its distinct properties, being membrane-associated at resting [Ca2+], that contribute to its function as a Ca2+ sensor.

Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Google Scholar). The adenosine uridine-rich element (ARE) is the most common regulatory determinant found in the 3′-UTR of many unstable mRNAs, and several types have been described (1Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Google Scholar). The ARE induces rapid mRNA turnover by first triggering poly(A) shortening, then inducing both 5′-end decapping and RNA body degradation by either 5′ and 3′ exonuclease complexes (1Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Google Scholar, 2Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 193-198Google Scholar, 3Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E.

Recent data also suggest involvement of the ubiquitin-dependent pathway in the control of ARE-mediated mRNA turnover (5Laroia G. Sarkar B. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1842-1846Google Scholar). Whereas the ARE-mediated cap-dependent deadenylation model is largely accepted in yeast, it remains to be demonstrated in mammalian cells. For this reason, human homologs of the yeast decapping enzyme were cloned (6Van Dijk E. Cougot N. Meyer S. Babajko S. Wahle E. Seraphin B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6915-6924Google Scholar), and a mRNA-decapping activity was shown to be regulated by ARE in HeLa cells (7Gao M. Wilusz C.J. Peltz S.W. Wilusz J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1134-1143Google Scholar). The ARE is also a translational silencer (8Kruys V. Huez G. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 862-866Google Scholar, 9Jarzembowski J.A. Rajagopalan L.E. Shin H.C. Malter J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3660-3666Google Scholar, 10Mukhopadhyay D. Houchen C.W. Kennedy S. Dieckgraefe B.K. Anant S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 113-126Google Scholar). The main question is whether ARE works both as an mRNA destabilizer and a translational repressor. Both termini of an mRNA can associate via an interaction between the cap binding complex (eukaryotic initiation factor 4F) and the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (11Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-520Google Scholar, 12Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Google Scholar, 13Gallie D.R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 1-11Google Scholar). By facilitating the binding of these proteins on their substrates, this interaction protects the mRNA extremities from the degradation and potentiates the translation of capped mRNAs. Because a poly(A) tail is needed for both mRNA stabilization and efficient translation (1Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Google Scholar, 14Dreyfus M. Regnier P. Cell. 2002; 111: 611-613Google Scholar) and because factors associated with the cis-stabilizing element of the highly stable α-Globin mRNA cooperate with PABP (15Wang Z. Day N. Trifillis P. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4552-4560Google Scholar), AREs may control mRNA decay and translation by targeting the PABP/poly(A) tail association. In this work we used the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) ARE as a model. The GM-CSF is a hematopoietic growth factor that influences the commitment, differentiation, and functional activity of myelomonocytic cells (16Metcalf D. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 204: 40-50Google Scholar). This ARE belongs to class IIA and contains five reiterations of the AUUU motifs embedded in an AU-rich sequence. It was the first to be associated with the control of mRNA stability (1Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Google Scholar, 17Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Google Scholar). The physiological importance of the ARE in the control of GM-CSF gene expression was demonstrated in transgenic mice bearing GM-CSF gene constructs lacking the ARE that presented severe hematopoietic disorders (18Houzet L. Morello D. Defrance P. Mercier P. Huez G. Kruys V. Blood. 2001; 98: 1281-1288Google Scholar). The control of translation by the GM-CSF ARE is much less documented. ARE-containing mRNAs are poorly translated, and the GM-CSF ARE inhibits translation in vitro (8Kruys V. Huez G. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 862-866Google Scholar, 9Jarzembowski J.A. Rajagopalan L.E. Shin H.C. Malter J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3660-3666Google Scholar). To date many ARE-binding proteins (ARE-BPs) have been described (1Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Google Scholar, 19Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Google Scholar). These include the embryonic lethal abnormal visual system-like protein family including HuR, CUGBP2, a novel ARE-BP involved in cyclooxygenase-2 post-transcriptional regulation (10Mukhopadhyay D. Houchen C.W. Kennedy S. Dieckgraefe B.K. Anant S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 113-126Google Scholar), the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D isoforms, T-cell restricted intracellular antigen-1/TIAR proteins, and tristetraprolin (1Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Google Scholar, 2Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 193-198Google Scholar, 19Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Google Scholar, 20Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 320-325Google Scholar). Because they associate with the ARE, these proteins are thought to participate in ARE effects on either mRNA decay or translation. However, further investigations need to be made to understand their exact role in these mechanisms. We sought whether the GM-CSF ARE could control in vivo the translation of a reporter gene. Using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression system, we demonstrate that the GM-CSF ARE represses translation independently of its mRNA-destabilizing effect. In a context of cap-independent translation, the GM-CSF ARE is no longer efficient as a destabilizing element, whereas it still functions as a translational repressor. Finally, we show that the GM-CSF ARE intervenes on PABP binding on the poly(A) tail. Plasmid Constructions—Plasmids pT7/T3α-18, pDsRed2-N1, pEGFP-C3, and pIRES2-EGFP were purchased from either Invitrogen or Ozyme (Saint Quentin, France). To generate plasmids pEGFP-B and pEGFP-A, the BglII- and BamHI-digested PCR fragments containing either the whole β-globin 3′-UTR (amplified from pBFB template (a gift of Dr. J. Belasco, New York University School of Medicine, New York) using primers 5′-GAAGATCTCTAATTC CCTCTGCCAAAAATTATG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCAGCCAGAAGTCAGATGCTC-3′) or the GM-CSF ARE (amplified from pcD-GM-CSF template (ATCC) using primers 5′-GAAGATCTCTAACAGGCATGGCAGAAGAATG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCATTACGGTAAAACATCTTGAATA-3′) were inserted in the BglII site from pEGFP-C3. To generate plasmid p0, the 5′-UTR and the total EGFP coding region was cut out by NheI and BglII, filled-in, and re-ligated on itself. To generate the plasmid pEGFP-0 the whole 5′-UTR including the start codon for EGFP was deleted from pEGFP-C3 by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the primer 5′-CGTCAGATCCGTGAGCAAGGGCG-3′ and its antisense. To generate plasmid pEGFP-Am, eight point mutations were inserted in the GM-CSF ARE of pEGFP-A plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis as before using the primer 5′-TACTACAGAAATCAGTAATATTTGTATATTTGTATGTTTAAAATATGTATGTATGTAT GTATGTAAGTTCATATTCCATATTTATTCAAG-3′ and its antisense. To generate plasmid pIRES-0, the EGFP coding region was removed from pIRES2-EGFP by digestion with SmaI and NotI and filled-in and religated on itself. To generate plasmids pIRES-Am and pIRES-A, the ScaI/SmaI fragment from either pEGFP-Am or pEGFP-A was inserted by blunt-end ligation in the NotI-cut filled-in pIRES2-EGFP plasmid. When necessary, the constructs were controlled by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, Cell Extract Preparations—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed by electroporation (VECM 800 electroporator BTX, Illkirch, France). When indicated, cells were co-transfected with pDsRED2-N1 plasmid, used as control for transfection efficiency. Cytoplasmic lysates were prepared from HeLa cells as described (21Grosset C. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Sonenberg N. Jacquemin-Sablon H. Shyu A.B. Cell. 2000; 103: 29-40Google Scholar). Northern Analysis—Isolation of total RNA was performed using the Nucleospin RNA II kit from Macherey-Nagel (Hoerdt, France). Northern blots were performed as described (21Grosset C. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Sonenberg N. Jacquemin-Sablon H. Shyu A.B. Cell. 2000; 103: 29-40Google Scholar). The mRNA amounts were quantitated directly by scanning blots on an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was carried out on cytoplasmic lysates as described (21Grosset C. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Sonenberg N. Jacquemin-Sablon H. Shyu A.B. Cell. 2000; 103: 29-40Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies were purchased as follows: anti-EGFP was from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada), anti-α-tubulin was from Sigma, anti-HuR was from Santa Cruz (Heidelberg, Germany). Monoclonal antibody against TIAR was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Anderson (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston) and Jean-Luc Taupin (Université Victor Ségalen Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux, France). Monoclonal antibody against PABP was kindly provided by Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA). Preparation of RNA Probes—In vitro transcription reactions were performed according to the instructions of Promega (Charbonnières, France) using T7 RNA polymerase and either the XbaI- or SacI-linearized AT-UTRp(A+) or GC-UTRp(A+) plasmids, kindly provided by Dr. Joan A. Steitz (New Haven, CT) as templates (22Voeltz G.K. Ongkasuwan J. Standart N. Steitz J.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 774-788Google Scholar). Labeled RNA transcripts were produced by including [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the reaction mixtures. Analysis of Ribonucleoprotein Interactions and Gel Supershift Assays—Binding reactions were performed as described (21Grosset C. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Sonenberg N. Jacquemin-Sablon H. Shyu A.B. Cell. 2000; 103: 29-40Google Scholar). The volume of each reaction mixture was 50 μl, and incubations were performed at room temperature. Cytoplasmic lysate (25 μg of protein) and 32P-labeled RNA (2.5 ng) were incubated for 15 min, then unbound RNA was digested for 20 min by RNase T1 (25 units/tube). Next, the mixture was distributed in 10-μl aliquots, and 1 μl of antibody was added or not in the indicated tube. The mixture was further incubated for 20 min. Finally, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes were resolved in 5 or 6% polyacrylamide non-denaturing low ionic strength gels. Analysis of Cells by Flow Cytometry—Three days after transfection HeLa cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, detached by trypsinization, collected, stored on ice, and analyzed by flow cytometry using an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Coulter) and the Expo 32 analysis software. Ten thousand cellular events were gated using forward and side scatter settings. HeLa cells transfected with non-fluorescent reporter expressing plasmids were used as the negative control to gate the EGFP- or DsRed-positive cell populations. To avoid interference between EGFP and DsRed detectors, a lower amount of pDsRed2-N1 plasmid was used for the co-transfections in comparison with the other tested plasmid, and we adjusted the compensation settings provided with the Expo 32 analysis software. So that the flow cytometry and Western blotting data could be compared, the global EGFP expression of the cell population was determined by taking into account the mean fluorescence intensity of the EGFP-positive population and the percentage of the EGFP-positive cells (% EGFP+) obtained from data plots and expressed as an arbitrary unit. This global EGFP expression was normalized as [(mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the test – MFI of negative control)/MFI of negative control] × [%EGFP+ of the test – %EGFP+ of the negative control]. The transfection efficiency in each condition was compared on the basis of the percentage of DsRed-positive cells (Figs. 3 and 5).Fig. 5The GM-CSF ARE represses translation of an IRES-containing mRNA but can no longer mediate its decay. Panel A, HeLa cells were transfected with increasing amounts (5–50 μg of DNA) of the plasmids pIRES-Am or pIRES-A and 50 μg of pIRES-0 plasmid as the negative control. In each transfection the total amount of DNA was kept constant at 50 μg by adding appropriate amounts of the pIRES-0 plasmid. Analysis was performed by flow cytometry as described in Fig. 2. The EGFP expression ±S.D. and the percentage of EGFP-positive cells ±S.D. is shown as described in Fig. 2 (an average of two experiments in duplicate was performed). Panels B–D, HeLa cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid pDsRed2-N1 used as control for transfection efficiency and 20 μg of the plasmids pIRES-Am (lane 2), pIRES-A (lane 3), or the control plasmid pIRES-0 (lane 1). Analysis was performed by flow cytometry (panel B), Western blotting (panel C), and Northern blotting (panel D) as described in Fig. 2. In panel B, the top line shows the percentage of the DsRed-positive cells. The bottom part shows the EGFP expression ±S.D. and the percentage of EGFP-positive cells ±S.D. as described in Fig. 2 (average of 4 experiments). The loading controls used for Western and Northern blots and mRNA quantitation were the same as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The GM-CSF ARE Potently Represses in Vivo Translation—To investigate the ARE effect in vivo we chose the EGFP as reporter gene and flow cytometry as a sensitive and quantitative method to evaluate the global EGFP expression of the cell population. To validate the flow cytometric data, Western blotting was performed in parallel. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids containing either the whole β-globin 3′-UTR (60 nucleotides long, Fig. 1, plasmid pEGFP-B) or the GM-CSF ARE (136 nucleotides long, Fig. 1, plasmid pEGFP-A) immediately downstream of the EGFP coding region in the pEGFP-C3 plasmid. pT7/T3α-18 was used as negative control. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, when HeLa cells were transfected by pEGFP-A, GM-CSF ARE dramatically decreased the EGFP expression (around 72-fold in flow cytometric measurements), whereas the percentage of EGFP-positive cells was reduced by 40%. The steady-state level of EGFP-A mRNA was also reduced when compared with EGFP-B mRNA (3.4 ± 1.4-fold, average of 4 experiments) but remained easily detectable (Fig. 2C), thus confirming the role of the GM-CSF ARE as a destabilizing element. Reduced EGFP expression in cells transfected with pEGFP-A together with the persistence of the corresponding mRNA pointed to a repressive effect of the GM-CSF ARE on in vivo translation.Fig. 2In vivo effects of the GM-CSF ARE on EGFP mRNA and protein expressions. HeLa cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid pEGFP-B (lane 2), pEGFP-A (lane 3), or the irrelevant plasmid pT7/T3α-18 (lane 1). Three days after transfection EGFP expression was assayed on the cell population by flow cytometry (panel A) and Western blotting (panel B). The EGFP mRNAs were analyzed on total RNA by Northern blotting (panel C). In panel A, the top part shows cytometry patterns (one representative experiment with the percentage of positive cells also given). The bottom part of panel A shows the corresponding EGFP expression ±S.D. (as calculated under “Experimental Procedure”), and above the corresponding histograms, the percentage ±S.D. of the EGFP-positive cells; an average of four experiments is shown. In Western blots loading controls were performed by checking α-tubulin expression. In Northern blot, loading controls were performed by checking β-actin mRNA expression. Amounts of EGFP mRNAs were determined by as disintegrations/min of tested mRNA/disintegrations/min of β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the nature of the EGFP coding region and the GM-CSF ARE in the plasmid pEGFP-A was controlled by DNA sequencing, the dramatic decrease in EGFP expression observed in the cells could not be accounted for by mutations abolishing the protein expression. However, to demonstrate the ARE specificity in the translational repression in cells transfected by pEGFP-A, further investigations were performed. Two negative controls (plasmids p0 and pEGFP-0) for EGFP expression were made from the backbone of the pEGFP-C3 plasmid. The p0 plasmid was obtained by deleting the 5′-UTR and the whole EGFP coding region (Fig. 1B) and was used as negative control for both EGFP and mRNA expression in transfected cells. As expected, neither EGFP mRNA nor protein was produced by cells transfected with this plasmid (Fig. 3, A–C, lanes 1). Similarly, the plasmid pEGFP-0 was obtained by deleting the 5′-UTR and the EGFP start codon (Fig. 1B). In transfected cells, this plasmid was used as negative control for EGFP expression and positive control for EGFP-mRNA expression. As expected, the transfected cells did not produce any EGFP, but a shorter mRNA (deleted of the 5′-UTR and the start codon) was easily detectable by Northern blot (Fig. 3, A–C, lanes 2). To assess the specificity of the ARE-mediated translational repression we made eight point mutations into the GM-CSF ARE that removed all AUUUA motifs and the AUUU repeats (Fig. 1A). Transfection of HeLa cells with the corresponding plasmid, namely pEGFP-Am (Fig. 1B), increased the EGFP expression (around 42-fold), the percentage of EGFP-positive cells (around 2-fold), and the steady-state level of its transcript (2.5 ± 0.3-fold, average of 2 experiments) compared with pEGFP-A, which contains the functional ARE (Fig. 3, A–C, compare lanes 3 and 4). These results demonstrated that the translational repression was ARE-specific. The ARE-mediated inhibition on EGFP translation from pEGFP-Am was around 1.7-fold less marked when compared with the inhibition on translation from pEGFP-B. It is likely that the eight point mutations inserted in the GM-CSF ARE (plasmid pEGFP-Am) were not sufficient to totally abolish the GM-CSF ARE effects on EGFP expression. To assess transfection efficiency during these experiments cells were co-transfected with the pDsRed2-N1 plasmid constitutively expressing a red fluorescent protein (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). As shown in Fig. 3A, top line, a similar amount of HeLa cells expressed only the DsRed protein in the different conditions. Therefore, the difference in EGFP expression could not be accounted for by a variation in the transfection efficiency. Finally, we examined the ARE-mediated translational repression by transfecting cells with increasing amounts of either pEGFP-Am or pEGFP-A (Fig. 4). In cells transfected by pEGFP-Am, EGFP mRNA and protein expressions increased in parallel to the amounts of plasmid used for transfections (Fig. 4, A–C, lanes 2–4). In this case, EGFP remained hardly detectable by either flow cytometry or Western blotting when cells were transfected with increasing amounts of pEGFP-A, whereas the EGFP-A mRNA accumulated (Fig. 4, A–C, lanes 5–7). In the experiments performed in Figs. 3 and 4 using the pEGFP-Am plasmid, flow cytometric results showed that the cap-dependent translation was inhibited around 40-fold by the GM-CSF ARE whatever the amount of DNA used for the transfection. Together, these data clearly demonstrate that EGFP translation was efficiently repressed by the GM-CSF ARE in vivo independently of its destabilizing effects on mRNA. GM-CSF ARE Represses Encephalomyocarditis Virus (ECMV) Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES)-dependent Translation—To investigate the repressive role of the ARE on cap-independent translation, we investigated the effects of the GM-CSF ARE when EGFP translation was initiated from the IRES. Cells were transfected by either the pIRES-0 plasmid as the negative control (obtained by deletion of the EGFP coding region in the plasmid pIRES2-EGFP, Fig. 1B) or the pIRES-A and pIRES-Am plasmids containing the 136 nucleotides GM-CSF ARE or its mutated counterpart, respectively, downstream of the EGFP coding region in the pIRES2-EGFP plasmid (Fig. 1B). When we performed transfection experiments under the conditions described in Figs. 2 and 3 (with 5 μg of plasmid), we observed that EGFP was not detectable in the cells, especially those transfected with the positive-control pIRES-Am plasmid, which contains the non-functional ARE. Therefore, we performed dose-response experiments by transfecting the cells with increasing amounts of either pIRES-Am or pIRES-A, as for pEGFP-Am and pEGFP-A (Fig. 4). Fig. 5A shows that in cells transfected by pIRES-Am, EGFP expression increased in parallel to the amounts of plasmid used for transfections. However, the level of EGFP was almost undetectable with 5 μg of pIRES-Am (Fig. 5A), thus explaining why in the same conditions no EGFP was detected in our previous experiments. By comparing the dose-response results in Figs. 4A and 5A, it may be seen that the level of EGFP expression in cells transfected by pIRES-Am was much lower than in cells transfected with pEGFP-Am (around 180-fold less when using 20 μg of DNA). This clearly demonstrates that the translation initiated from the ECMV IRES was much less efficient in the HeLa cells than the cap-dependent translation and that flow cytometry was sensitive enough to allow the detection and quantification of low amounts of fluorescent EGFP. When cells were transfected with increasing amounts of pIRES-A, which contains the functional ARE, the EGFP expression level was always lower than that obtained when using the control pIRES-Am plasmid (Fig. 5A, around 12-fold with 20 μg of DNA and around 5-fold with 50 μg of plasmid), undetectable in cells transfected with 5 μg of DNA, and remained low even with high amounts of DNA. These data point to a repressive role of the GM-CSF ARE on IRES-dependent translation. However, to further demonstrate this repressive effect, we performed transfection experiments using 20 μg of either pIRES-Am, pIRES-A, or the negative pIRES-0 plasmid and evaluated the expression level of both EGFP and mRNA as before by flow cytometry and Western and Northern blotting. Flow cytometric and Western blot results (Fig. 5, B and C) showed that in cells transfected with the pIRES-A, the EGFP expression level and the percentage of the EGFP-positive cells were strongly decreased (around 28- and 5-fold, respectively, from flow cytometric data), thus suggesting that IRES-dependent translation, like cap-dependent translation, was inhibited by the GM-CSF ARE. As in the experiments shown in Fig. 3, transfection efficiency was assessed by co-transfecting the cells with the pDsRed2-N1 plasmid. Here again, a similar amount of HeLa cells expressed the DsRed protein in the different conditions (Fig. 5B, top line), thus demonstrating that the difference in EGFP expression could not be accounted for by a variation in the transfection efficiency of the cells. Interestingly, Northern blot analysis showed that GM-CSF ARE was no longer functional as a destabilizing element when translation was initiated from the ECMV IRES, since the steady-state level of the IRES-EGFP mRNAs was the same whether the transcript contained the GM-CSF ARE or its mutated counterpart (Fig. 5D). The GM-CSF ARE Intervenes in PABP Binding on the Poly(A) Tail—Because ARE-mediated mRNA decay begins by 3′-end poly(A) shortening (1Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Google Scholar, 2Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 193-198Google Scholar, 19Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Google Scholar), the GM-CSF ARE can suppress both cap- and IRES-dependent translation (see above), and the PABPs have been shown to participate in both translations (11Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-520Google Scholar, 12Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Google Scholar, 13Gallie D.R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 1-11Google Scholar, 23Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Liebig H.D. Sonenberg N. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1743-1752Google Scholar), we investigated whether the ARE may intervene in PABP binding on the poly(A) tail. We performed gel mobility shift assays using HeLa cytoplasmic extracts, two polyadenylated RNA probes (probes AU-UTR(A+) and GC-UTR(A+)) with a poly(A) tail 100 nucleotides long and their deadenylated counterparts (probes AU-UTR(A–) and GC-UTR(A–)) (Fig. 6A). The AU-UTR probes contained the minimal functional part of the GM-CSF ARE, whereas the GC-UTR probes contained a mutated GM-CSF ARE (Fig. 6A). The polyadenylated RNA probes were transcribed in vitro using the T7 RNA polymerase and the SacI-linearized AT-UTRp(A+) and GC-UTRp(A+) plasmids (kindly provided by Joan A. Steitz) as templates (22Voeltz G.K. Ongkasuwan J. Standart N. Steitz J.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 774-788Google Scholar). In parallel, the deadenylated RNA probes were transcribed in vitro as before using the XbaI-linearized AT-UTRp(A+) and GC-UTRp(A+) plasmids as templates. When we performed gel mobility shift assay using the deadenylated non-ARE GC-UTR(A–) RNA probe, no specific RNP complexes formed (Fig. 6B, left panel), suggesting that no HeLa cytoplasmic protein was able to associate with the GC-UTR RNA core. When we performed gel mobility shift assay using the deadenylated ARE-containing AU-UTR(A–) RNA probe, we observed the formation of three major RNP complexes (Fig. 6B, right panel) corresponding to the RNP pattern obtained with the full-length GM-CSF ARE probe (data not shown). To assess the ARE specificity of the complexes, we added antibody against HuR and TIAR, two potent ARE-BPs (1Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Google Scholar, 2Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 193-198Google Scholar, 19Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Google Scholar). As expected, supershifted complexes appeared either with anti-HuR or anti-TIAR antibodies (arrowheads in Fig. 6B, right panel). However, no supershift was observed with the anti-PABP antibody (Fig. 6B, lane 10) or when using the GC-UTR(A–) RNA probe with any of these different antibodies (Fig. 6B, left panel). These results showed that some proteins associated specifically with the AU-UTR (but not with the GC-UTR core) and that HuR and TIAR, two well known ARE-BPs, but not PABP, figure among these proteins. Therefore, we performed experiments using the polyadenylated RNA p"
