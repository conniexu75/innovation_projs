https://openalex.org/W2020755048,"Psycholinguists have commonly assumed that as a spoken linguistic message unfolds over time, it is initially structured by a syntactic processing module that is encapsulated from information provided by other perceptual and cognitive systems. To test the effects of relevant visual context on the rapid mental processes that accompany spoken language comprehension, eye movements were recorded with a head-mounted eye-tracking system while subjects followed instructions to manipulate real objects. Visual context influenced spoken word recognition and mediated syntactic processing, even during the earliest moments of language processing."
https://openalex.org/W2037667533,"ALTHOUGH phantom-limb pain is a frequent consequence of the amputation of an extremity, little is known about its origin1-4. On the basis of the demonstration of substantial plasticity of the somatosensory cortex after amputation5 or somatosensory deafferentation in adult monkeys6, it has been suggested that cortical reorganization could account for some non-painful phantom-limb phenomena in amputees and that cortical reorganization has an adaptive (that is, pain-preventing) function2,5,7,8. Theoretical and empirical work on chronic back pain9,10 has revealed a positive relationship between the amount of cortical alteration and the magnitude of pain, so we predicted that cortical reorganization and phantom-limb pain should be positively related. Using non-invasive neuromagnetic imaging techniques to determine cortical reorganization in humans11-13, we report a very strong direct relationship (r = 0.93) between the amount of cortical reorganization and the magnitude of phantom limb pain (but not non-painful phantom phenomena) experienced after arm amputation. These data indicate that phantom-limb pain is related to, and may be a consequence of, plastic changes in primary somatosensory cortex."

The order of neurogenesis was found to be highly conserved across a wide range of mammals and to correlate with the relative enlargement of structures as brain size increases, with disproportionately large growth occurring in late-generated structures. Because the order of neurogenesis is conserved, the most likely brain alteration resulting from selection for any behavioral ability may be a coordinated enlargement of the entire nonolfactory brain."

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that both NO donors inhibited NF-κB activation by tumor necrosis factor-α. This effect was not mediated by guanylyl cyclase activation since the cGMP analogue 8-bromo-cGMP had no similar effect. Inhibition of endogenous constitutive NO production by L-N-monomethylarginine, however, activated NF-κB, suggesting tonic inhibition of NF-κB under basal conditions. NO had little or no effects on other nuclear binding proteins such as AP-1 and GATA. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that NO stabilized the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα, by preventing its degradation from NF-κB. NO also increased the mRNA expression of IκBα, but not NF-κB subunits, p65 or p50, and transfection experiments with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene linked to the IκBα promoter suggested transcriptional induction of IκBα by NO. We propose that the induction and stabilization of IκBα by NO are important mechanisms by which NO inhibits NF-κB and attenuate atherogenesis.

We propose that the induction and stabilization of IκBα by NO are important mechanisms by which NO inhibits NF-κB and attenuate atherogenesis. Nitric oxide (NO) possesses many anti-atherogenic properties including its ability to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (1Garg U.C. Hassid A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1774-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar), reduce platelet aggregation (2Radomski M.W. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 92: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), and prevent monocyte chemotaxis and adhesion (3Bath P.M. Hassall D.G. Gladwin A.M. Palmer R.M. Martin J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Recent in vivo studies have shown that NO can attenuate endothelium-leukocyte interactions and limit the extent of atherosclerotic lesions (4Kubes P. Suzuki M. Granger D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4651-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (2817) Google Scholar, 5Cooke J.P. Singer A.H. Tsao P. Zera P. Rowan R.A. Billingham M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Although many of the effects of NO are attributed to cGMP-dependent pathways, the precise mechanism(s) by which NO attenuates atherogenesis remain largely unknown. We have recently demonstrated that NO reduces leukocyte attachment to the endothelial surface by decreasing cytokine-induced expression of endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (designated VCAM-1), endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1 or E-selectin), and to a lesser extent, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (6De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.-B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of other pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 were similarly inhibited by NO. All of these genes share specific DNA binding motifs in their promoters for interaction with the transcription factor, NF-κB. Indeed, we found that NO's inhibitory effects were mediated not via cGMP-dependent pathways but instead via inhibition of NF-κB (6De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.-B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB was initially described as a heterodimeric complex, which binds to specific decameric sequences in the immunoglogulin κ light chain enhancer (7Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). Members of the mammalian NF-κB family possess Rel homology domains necessary for dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding. They can be divided into two groups based upon their structure and function (8Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar). The first group consists of p65 (Rel A), c-Rel, and RelB, which contain transcriptional activation domains necessary for gene induction (9Ballard D.W. Dixon E.P. Peffer N.J. Bogerd H. Doerre S. Stein B. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1875-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The second group consists of p105 and p100, which upon proteolytic processing give rise to p50 (NF-κB1) and p52 (NF-κB2), respectively (10Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of p105 and p100 share structural features with the NF-κB inhibitor, IκB, and thus, functions to retain NF-κB in the cytoplasm (11Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Isral A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12Scheinman R.I. Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6089-6101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mature proteins, p50 and p52, however, can form functional dimers with members of both groups (8Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar). With the exception of RelB, which cannot form homodimers, members of both groups can bind in a tissue-specific manner as homo- or heterodimers to enhancer elements of target genes (13Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). In vascular endothelial cells, the transcriptional induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 depends upon the activation of the p65/p50 heterodimer (14Neish A.S. Williams A.J. Palmer H.J. Whitley M.Z. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1583-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through its association with its inhibitors, p105 or IκB-like proteins (8Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar, 10Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Although several different IκB-like proteins have been identified such as IκBα (MAD3) (15Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson-Johannes A. Mondal K. Ralph P.

Cell. 1990; 60: 991-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), and unprocessed p105 (11Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Isral A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12Scheinman R.I. Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6089-6101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the most well characterized is the 37-kDa protein, IκBα (10Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB by cytokines or oxidative stress requires either the degradation of its cytoplasmic inhibitor IκBα or proteolytic cleavage of p105 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (8Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar, 19Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that phosphorylation of IκBα or p105 is a key step in targeting these inhibitors for degradation (20DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Alkalay R. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Jung S. Avraham A. Gerlitz O. Pashut-Lavon I. Ben-Neriah Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, factors that affect the phosphorylation and/or expression of IκBα could modulate the activation of NF-κB. Several lines of evidence suggest that NO may modulate IκBα. First, NO has been shown to activate protein phosphatases in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (22Lander H.M. Sehajpal P. Levine D.M. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1509-1516PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the possibility that NO may inhibit NF-κB via dephosphorylation of IκBα. Second, oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide have been shown to stimulate protein kinase activity and activate NF-κB (23Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17131-17137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Because NO can avidly scavenge superoxide anion, it can prevent superoxide anion from forming its dimutation product, hydrogen peroxide (25Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Furthermore, under certain conditions, NO can act as an electron donor or antioxidant (26Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). Antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC)1( 1The abbreviations used are: PDTCpyrrolidine dithiocarbamateEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayGSNOS-nitrosoglutathioneCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseTNFαtumor necrosis factorkbkilobase pair(s)PBSphosphate-buffered salineL-NMAL-N-monomethylarginine.) have been shown to inhibit the activation of NF-κB by preventing the dissociation of the NF-κB/IκBα complex (27Henkel T.

Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that NO inhibits NF-κB by modulating IκBα. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism(s) by which this occurs. pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate electrophoretic mobility shift assay S-nitrosoglutathione chloramphenicol acetyltransferase tumor necrosis factor kilobase pair(s) phosphate-buffered saline L-N-monomethylarginine. All standard culture reagents were obtained from JRH Bioscience (Lenexa, KS). Glutathione, sodium nitrite, sodium nitroprusside PDTC, 8-bromo-cGMP, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma. S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) was synthesized from glutathione and sodium nitrite as described (29Kowaluk E.A. Fung H.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 1256-1264PubMed Google Scholar). L-N-Monomethylarginine was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Recombinant human TNFα was purchased from Endogen, Inc. (Boston, MA). The Limulus amebocyte lysate kinetic chromogenic assay for endotoxin was performed by BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and [3H]chloramphenicol (37 Ci/mmol) were supplied by DuPont NEN. The oligonucleotides corresponding to the palindromic NF-κB, AP-1, and GATA consensus sequence and affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antisera to p65, p50, IκBα, c-Fos, c-Jun, GATA-2, and GATA-3 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Nucleic acid and protein molecular weight markers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The antibody detection kit (Enhanced Chemiluminescence) using horseradish peroxidase and luminol was obtained from Amersham Corp. Nylon transfer membranes were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell. The full-length human cDNA probes for NF-κB subunits, p65 and p50, and IκBα were generously provided by Gary Nabel (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) and Stephen Haskill (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC), respectively. The murine IκBα promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene was generously provided by P. Chiao and I. Verma (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Human endothelial cells were harvested from saphenous veins using Type II collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) and grown to confluence in a culture medium containing Medium 199, 20 mM HEPES, 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth serum (Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, MA), 100 μg/ml heparin sulfate, 5 mML-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), and antibiotic mixture of penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml)/fungizone (1.25 μg/ml) as described previously (30Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). They were characterized by Nomarski optical microscopy (Zeiss ICM 405, 40 × objective) and staining for Factor VIII-related antigen (31Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Only endothelial cells of less than three passages were used. Cells were pretreated with NO donors for 30 min prior to stimulation with TNFα. Cellular viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (32Dignam J.K. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). The NF-κB oligonucleotide corresponding to the palindromic NF-κB consensus sequence (AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), and purified by G-50 Sephadex columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were added to 32P-labeled NF-κB oligonucleotide (~20,000 cpm, 0.2 ng) in a buffer containing 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Boehringer Mannheim), 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol (total volume of 20 μl). DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresed at 12 V/cm for 3 h in low ionic strength buffer (0.5 × TBE) at 4°C. For supershift assays, the indicated antibody (15 μg/ml) was added to the nuclear extracts from TNFα-stimulated cells for 10 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. In some studies, GSNO or unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide (20 ng) was added directly to the nuclear extracts from TNFα-stimulated cells for 10 min prior to addition of radiolabeled probe. The binding conditions for AP-1 (CGCTTGATGACT-CAGCCGGAA) and GATA (CACTTGATAACAGAAAGTGATAACTCT) oligonucleotides were the same as that for NF-κB except 50 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl2 were substituted for 50 mM NaCl. Agarose-conjugated anti-p65 antibody (100 μg of IgG/ml) was incubated with whole cell lysates (200 μg) or nuclear extracts (100 μg) in 100 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing NaCl (150 mM), Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 7.4), SDS (0.2%), and Triton X-100 (1%) for 16 h at 4°C with gentle rotation. Preliminary studies indicated that all p65 was completely precipitated by this procedure, since immunoblotting analysis of the supernatant using the anti-p65 antibody did not reveal the presence of 65-kDa proteins. The immunoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer (pH 8.3) and once with NaCl (150 mM), Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 7.4), and EDTA (5 mM), and then resuspended in denaturing buffer containing Tris-HCl (125 mM, pH 6.8), SDS (4%), glycerol (20%), and 2-mercaptoethanol (10%). The mixture was placed briefly (1 min) in boiling water prior to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants and known molecular size markers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% running, 4% stacking gel). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto Westran polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated overnight at 4°C with blocking solution (5% skim milk in PBS). Affinity-purified rabbit antibodies (0.4 μg of IgG/ml) to NF-κB subunits and IκBα were incubated with the blots overnight at 4°C in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20. The blots were washed twice with PBS buffer and then treated with donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:4000 dilution) coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Immunodetection was accomplished using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit as described previously (31Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted by guanidinium isothiocyanate and isolated by CsCl equilibrium centrifugation as described (30Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total RNA (20 μg/lane) were separated by 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred overnight onto nylon membranes by capillary action, and baked for 2 h at 80°C prior to prehybridization for at least 4 h in a solution containing 5 × SSC, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Radiolabeling of p65, p50, IκBα, and human β-actin cDNA probe (ATCC 37997, Rockville, MD) was performed using random hexamer priming with [α-32P]CTP and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Pharmacia). The membranes were hybridized separately with individual probes overnight at 45°C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. All Northern blots were subjected to stringent washing conditions (0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C) prior to autoradiography with intensifying screen at −80°C for 24-72 h. The functional murine IκBα promoter (−1.6 kb upstream from transcriptional initiation start site) linked to the CAT reporter gene (pBS[-1.6 kb]CAT) was described previously by Chiao and Verma (33Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Bovine rather than human endothelial cells were used because of their higher transfection efficiency. Cells (2 × 106, 70% confluent) were transfected with 25 μg of either the IκBα promoter construct, pSV2.CAT (SV40 early promoter), or p.CAT (no promoter) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (34Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). As an internal control for tranfection efficiency, pRSV.βGAL plasmid (10 μg) was co-transfected in all experiments. Preliminary results using β-galactosidase staining indicate that cellular transfection efficiency was approximately 12-15%. After 72 h, cells were treated with GSNO (0.2 mM) and cellular extracts were prepared 12 h later using lysis buffer (100 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and one freeze-thaw cycle. The supernatant was obtained after centrifuging the extracts at 12,000 × g for 10 min. CAT activity was determined by incubating the supernatant (100 μl) with [3H]chloramphenicol (50 μCi/ml) and n-butyryl coenzyme A (250 μg/ml) for 20 h at 37°C (35Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The n-butyryl [3H]chloramphenicol was then separated from unmodified chloramphenicol by xylene phase extraction and counted for 2 min in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS1800). CAT activity was calculated from a standard curve using various concentrations of purified CAT (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed spectophometrically (absorption at 410 nm) and compared to a standard curve using known amounts of purified β-galactosidase (Sigma) as described previously (36Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The relative CAT activity was calculated as the ratio of CAT to β-galactosidase activity. Each experiment was performed three times in duplicate. All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. compared to controls and among separate experiments. Paired and unpaired Student's t tests were employed to determine the significance of changes in CAT activity. A significant difference was taken for p values less than 0.05. Human saphenous vein endothelial cells were confirmed by their morphological features (i.e. cuboidal, cobblestone, contact-inhibited) using phase-contrast microscopy and immunofluorescent-staining with antibodies to Factor VIII-related antigen. With the exception of transient transfections, there were no observable adverse effects of any treatment modalities on cellular confluence, morphology, and viability. L-N-Monomethylarginine (L-NMA), 8-bromo-cGMP, and PDTC contain no detectable levels of endotoxin (<0.01 ng/ml). GSNO had an endotoxin level of 0.02 ± 0.1 ng/ml. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that activation of NF-κB by TNFα is attenuated by NO in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Higher concentration of GSNO (0.5 mM) was required to inhibit NF-κB after 2 h of stimulation compared to that after 30 min, probably due to relatively lower levels of NO released from GSNO after 2 h. GSNO was effective only when added to whole cells rather than to nuclear extracts, suggesting that NO did not interfere directly with NF-κB binding to DNA and that mediators present in the intact cells were required to mediate NO's inhibitory effect on NF-κB. The shifted bands were specific for NF-κB since the addition of antibodies to NF-κB subunits, p65 and p50, abolished the NF-κB band and caused further gel retardation (supershift). Furthermore, the addition of 100-fold excess unlabeled (cold) NF-κB oligonucleotide to the nuclear extract specifically abolished the NF-κB band. Vascular endothelial cells possess constitutive NO synthase activity (30Liao J.K. Shin W.S. Lee W.Y. Clark S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 319-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Inhibition of endogenous endothelial NO production by L-NMA (1 mM) caused the activation of NF-κB without addition of cytokine, but did not further augment NF-κB activation in TNFα-stimulated cells (Fig. 2A). L-NMA reduced endogenous NO production by more than 80%, as measured by the conversion of [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline (data not shown). Activation of NF-κB by L-NMA was not due to contamination of L-NMA samples with bacterial LPS since endotoxin level was undetectable using the Limulus amebocyte lysate chromogenic assay (<0.01 ng/ml). Addition of exogenous NO (GSNO, 0.2 mM) to L-NMA-treated endothelial cells reduced NF-κB activation, indicating that endogenous NO is physiologically important in inhibiting NF-κB activation under basal conditions. The permeable cGMP analogue 8-bromo-cGMP (1 mM) had no appreciable effect on NF-κB activation, indicating that inhibition of NF-κB by NO is mediated via a cGMP-independent pathway. Although 8-bromo-cGMP did not affect NF-κB, it was still able to stimulate cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation in endothelial cells (data not shown). Activation of NF-κB by TNFα was not altered by glutathione or nitrite, the parent compounds used to synthesize GSNO (29Kowaluk E.A. Fung H.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 1256-1264PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that inhibition of NF-κB was actually due to the NO released by our NO donors (Fig. 2B). Both GSNO and another structurally different NO-generating compound, sodium nitroprusside (1 mM), have similar inhibitory effects on NF-κB. These findings make it relatively unlikely that inhibition of NF-κB by the NO donors was due to any metabolite other than NO. As a positive control, the antioxidant and metal chelator, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (0.2 mM) also inhibited the activation of NF-κB as demonstrated previously (27Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Krönke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The relative specificity of NO for NF-κB compared to other transcription factors was demonstrated by the fact that GSNO only minimally inhibited the activation of nuclear binding protein AP-1 and did not affect the activation of nuclear binding proteins GATA-2 or GATA-3 (Fig. 3). Immunoprecipitation studies with agarose-conjugated anti-p65 antibody followed by immunoblotting demonstrated that stimulation by TNFα resulted in the loss of IκBα from NF-κB complex (p65 and p50 subunits) after 30 min (Fig. 4). This loss of IκBα, however, was not observed in the presence of GSNO. Similarly, stimulation with TNFα caused a rapid disappearance of IκBα from whole cell lysates at 30 min followed by reappearance after 2 h (Fig. 5). In the presence of GSNO, there was no disappearance of IκBα but, instead, an induction of IκBα in a time-dependent manner. These results indicate that NO inhibited NF-κB by either stabilizing and/or reducing IκBα degradation.Figure 5:Immunoblotting of whole cell lysates (100 μg) using IκBα antibody showing the fate of IκBα after stimulation with TNFα (10 ng/ml) in the absence (Control) or presence of GSNO (0.2 mM). This is representative of three separate studies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a concentration-dependent manner, NO increased the steady-state mRNA expression of IκBα without affecting the expression of NF-κB subunits, p65 and p50, or β-actin at 24 h (Fig. 6). Activation of NF-κB by TNFα has been shown previously to induce the expression of IκBα (14Neish A.S. Williams A.J. Palmer H.J. Whitley M.Z. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1583-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The addition of GSNO produced a smaller increase in IκBα expression at 30 min, consistent with our hypothesis that NO inhibits NF-κB-mediated gene transcription (Fig. 7). GSNO, however, produced a greater increase in IκBα expression at subsequent time points compared to TNFα alone. This is because activation of NF-κB induces the expression of IκBα, which in turn, inhibits NF-κB and decreases IκBα's own subsequent expression. Since the induction of IκBα expression by NO is not mediated by NF-κB, IκBα expression is not subjected to its own negative autoregulatory control.Figure 7:Northern analyses (20 μg of total RNA/lane) showing the time-course of IκBα mRNA expression after stimulation with TNFα (10 ng/ml) in the absence (Control) or presence of GSNO (0.2 mM). Three separate experiments yielded similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The murine IκBα promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene, pBS[-1.6 kb]CAT, was used in transient transfection studies. These studies were performed with bovine rather than human endothelial cells due to higher transfectional effeciency with bovine cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (data not shown). The promoterless p.CAT produced essentially no relative CAT activity either basally (50 ± 35) or after treatment with TNFα (38 ± 34) or GSNO (25 ± 18) (Fig. 8). The highly expressed pSV2.CAT containing the SV40 early promoter exhibited a high level of relative CAT activity (1380 ± 258), which was also unaffected by TNFα (1240 ± 235) or GSNO (1334 ± 302). The pBS[-1.6 kb]CAT had a basal relative CAT activity of 206 ± 35. Treatment with GSNO caused a greater increase in relative CAT activity compared to TNFα (2546 ± 383 versus 1112 ± 232, p < 0.05). The combination of TNFα and GSNO produced a relative CAT activity of 3446 ± 383, which was significantly higher than that of GSNO alone (p < 0.05), indicating that transcriptional induction of IκBα by GSNO most likely occurred through transcription factor(s) other than NF-κB. We have shown that NO inhibits the activation of NF-κB through the induction and stabilization of the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα. The mechanism for NO's effect is independent of guanylyl cyclase activation since treatment with cGMP analogue 8-bromo-cGMP did not affect NF-κB activation. Interestingly, GSNO is effective only when added to whole cells rather than to nuclear extracts, suggesting that NO does not interfere directly with the physical binding of NF-κB to its cognate DNA and that NO requires cellular mediator(s) for its inhibitory effect(s) on NF-κB. These results are consistent with our finding that NO's inhibitory effects on NF-κB is mediated by IκBα. The relative selectivity of NO for NF-κB compared to AP-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3 also agrees with this conclusion since the activation of these other nuclear binding factors are presumably not regulated by IκBα. These results, therefore, provide a novel mechanism whereby NO could down-regulate the expression of NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory genes through induction and stabilization of IκBα. Although NF-κB has been extensively studied in cells of the immune system (8Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar), recent evidence indicates that this pleiotropic transcription factor also has importance in vascular biology, especially in the area of transplantation arteriosclerosis in which immunological regulation of NF-κB may modulate the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in monocytes/macrophages and vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells (37Collins T. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 499-508PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study by Lander et al. (22Lander H.M. Sehajpal P. Levine D.M. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1509-1516PubMed Google Scholar) reportedly shows that NO activates rather than inhibits NF-κB in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The discrepancy between their results and ours may be due to differences in the response of mononuclear cells to NO-generating compounds compared to that of vascular endothelial cells. Although NO itself may inhibit NF-κB, NO may activate other signaling pathways in mononuclear cells which may ultimately lead to the activation rather than to the inhibition of NF-κB. Furthermore, we studied the effects of NO-generating compounds on NF-κB in cytokine-stimulated cells, whereas their findings were based upon the effects of NO-generating compounds in unstimulated cells. Thus, it is possible that depending on the conditions, NO may have dual regulatory effects on NF-κB. NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm when complexed to its inhibitor, IκBα, or as dimers with unprocessed p105 or p100 (8Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar, 10Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The p65 subunit serves to bind IκBα to the NF-κB complex (38Urban M.B. Baeuerle P.A. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1975-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB involves phosphorylation of IκBα, followed by rapid degradation of the inhibitory subunit via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (19Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 39Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our finding that stimulation by TNFα resulted in the loss of IκBα from p65 and its initial disappearance from the cytosolic pool. Reappearance of IκBα resulted from the induction of IκBα expression by NF-κB (40Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The loss of IκBα was prevented by NO, which stabilizes the NF-κB/IκBα complex either through replacement of lost IκBα or inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation and/or degradation. Interestingly, vascular endothelial cells can produce NO constitutively and both endothelial and smooth muscle cells can express the inducible isoform of NO synthase in response to cytokine stimulation (41Xie Q. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the net activation of NF-κB in vascular wall cells during inflammation probably depends on a complex balance between stimulatory and inhibitory factors. The finding that inhibition of endogenous endothelial NO production by L-NMA could activate NF-κB suggests that constitutively produced NO may play an important physiologic role in tonically inhibiting the activation of NF-κB under basal conditions. This is supported by in vivo findings showing that inhibition of endogenous NO production by L-nitroarginine methylester promotes endothelium-leukocyte interactions, probably through the expression of NF-κB-dependent adhesion molecules (3Bath P.M. Hassall D.G. Gladwin A.M. Palmer R.M. Martin J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 4Kubes P. Suzuki M. Granger D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4651-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (2817) Google Scholar, 6De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.-B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, chronic supplementation of the nitric oxide precursor, L-arginine, in diets of hypercholesterolemic rabbits improves endothelial-dependent vasodilation and limits the extent of atherosclerotic lesions (5Cooke J.P. Singer A.H. Tsao P. Zera P. Rowan R.A. Billingham M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Endogenous levels of constitutive NO production, however, are not sufficiently high to inhibit TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB. Higher levels of NO such as those encountered by endothelial cells at sites of inflammation or the amount of NO achieved by our NO donors may be required to suppress the activation of NF-κB by cytokines. Exposure of macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells to cytokines leads to higher levels of NO generated by the inducible form of NO synthase compared to that produced by endothelial cells under basal condition (41Xie Q. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, higher NO activity could be achieved locally since endothelial cells are in close proximity to these endogenous sources of inducible NO in vivo and the possibility that NO could be modified into more stable and potent adducts such as nitrosothiols (42Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate that higher levels of NO produced by macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells may be the mechanism by which NO production is ultimately terminated since the induction of NO synthase in these cells requires the activation of NF-κB (41Xie Q. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine or PDTC have also been shown to stabilize the NF-κB/IκBα complex through scavenging reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion, which may activate NF-κB (24Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 42Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 43Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3421) Google Scholar). Stimulation of NADPH oxidase activity in leukocytes generates hydrogen peroxide from superoxide anion and induces protein phosphorylation (23Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17131-17137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known whether NF-κB activation induced by oxidative stress is due to hydrogen peroxide-mediated IκBα phosphorylation. Nevertheless, NO can bind superoxide anion with extremely high affinity (25Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Thus, one mechanism by which NO may stabilize IκBα and inhibit NF-κB activation is through scavenging superoxide anion, thereby decreasing its dimutation product, hydrogen peroxide. In addition, NO itself may directly affect protein kinases and/or phosphatases that regulate IκBα phosphorylation. Indeed, recent studies have shown that NO can stimulate the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase(s) (22Lander H.M. Sehajpal P. Levine D.M. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1509-1516PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether this increase in phosphatase activity could lead to the dephosphorylation and stabilization of IκBα. A novel finding in this study is that a free radical such as NO can induce the expression of a transcription factor inhibitor, IκBα. Transfection studies using the IκBα promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene suggests that this effect occurs at the transcriptional level. NO had no effect on the expression of NF-κB subunits, p65 and p50. Previous analyses of the IκBα promoter have revealed multiple functional κB sites necessary for transcriptional induction by NF-κB (44Le Bail O. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Isral A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 45Cheng Q. Cant C.A. Moll T. Hofer-Warbinek R. Wagner E. Birnstiel M.L. Bach F.H. de Martin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13551-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This provides for an inducible autoregulatory pathway for terminating the activation of NF-κB (33Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 40Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). However, the induction of IκBα by NO is probably not mediated by NF-κB since NO inhibits NF-κB. Further analyses of IκBα promoter will be necessary to determine which DNA binding domain(s) constitute NO's cis-regulatory element(s). In summary, we have shown that NO can inhibit the activation of NF-κB through the induction and stabilization of its inhibitor, IκBα. The ability of endogenous NO to inhibit NF-κB provides new insight into the mechanisms of NO's anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. We are grateful to Gary Nabel (p65 and p50 cDNA), Stephen Haskill (IκBα cDNA), and I. Verma (IκBα promoter)."

Mice expressing the mutant form of the kinase show an increased level of Ca(2+)-independent CaMKII activity similar to that seen following LTP. The mice nevertheless exhibit normal LTP in response to stimulation at 100 Hz. However, at lower frequencies, in the range of 1-10 Hz, there is a systematic shift in the size and direction of the resulting synaptic change in the transgenic animals that favors LTD. The regulation of this frequency-response function by Ca(2+)-independent CaMKII activity seems to account for two previously unexplained synaptic phenomena, the relative loss of LTD in adult animals compared with juveniles and the enhanced capability for depression of facilitated synapses."

We show here that resolvase deficiency causes a larger proportion of molecules to be linked together by recombination junctions, resulting in the aggregation of mtDNA into a small number of cytological structures. This change in mtDNA structure can account for the increased mitotic loss of mtDNA and the altered pattern of mtDNA segregation from zygotes. We propose that the level of unresolved recombination junctions influences the number of heritable units of mtDNA."

https://openalex.org/W2025606056,"Gonadal steroidogenesis is regulated by pituitary gonadotropins and a locally produced, unidentified factor. A 70-kilodalton (kD) protein complex secreted from rat Sertoli cells was isolated. The complex, composed of 28- and 38-kD proteins, stimulated steroidogenesis by Leydig cells and ovarian granulosa cells in a dose-dependent and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-independent manner. The follicle-stimulating hormone-induced 28-kD protein appeared to be responsible for the bioactivity, but the 38-kD protein was indispensable for maximal activity. The 28- and 38-kD proteins were shown to be identical to the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and the proenzyme form of cathepsin L, respectively. Thus, a TIMP-1-procathepsin L complex is a potent activator of steroidogenesis and may regulate steroid concentrations and, thus, germ cell development in both males and females."

All three proteins possessed identical amino-terminal domains with significant similarity to the amino-terminal domain of the Drosophila disabled gene product and carboxyl-terminal domains containing proline-rich sequences characteristic of src homology region (domain 3) binding regions. BAC1.2F5 cells predominately expressed the p96 protein, although mRNA and protein corresponding to the p67 splice variant were also detected. Electrophoretic gel retardation of p96 in response to stimulation of the cells with colony-stimulating factor 1 was noticeable within 5 min after growth factor addition and reached a maximum at 60 min. Metabolic labeling experiments showed that the gel retardation of p96 was associated with increased phosphorylation of the protein exclusively on serine residues.

https://openalex.org/W1877847020,"Crystals formed in biological tissues often adopt remarkable morphologies that are thought to be determined mainly by the shapes of the confined spaces in which they grow. Another possible way of controlling crystal shape, demonstrated only in vitro, is by means of specialized proteins preferentially interacting with certain crystal faces. In so doing, they reduce the rate of growth in these directions and consequently change the overall crystal shape. In an X-ray diffraction study of the distribution of defects within the lattice of calcite crystals produced by certain sponges, we show that a remarkable correlation exists between the defect patterns or crystal texture and the macroscopic morphology of the spicules. This was observed in two cases in which proteins are present within the spicule crystal, but not in a third case where such intracrystalline proteins are absent. Furthermore, one of the spicules exhibited marked differences in texture even within families of structurally identical crystal planes, demonstrating that the organisms exert exquisite control over the microenvironment in which crystals grow. We conclude that highly controlled intercalation of specialized proteins inside the crystals is an additional means by which organisms control spicule growth."

Thus, the effects of the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were compared with those of heat shock on the expression, in PBM, of the major HSP, hsp70 and hsp90, using biometabolic labeling, Western and Northern blotting, and gel mobility shift assays. PMA induced the accumulation of mRNA and an increased expression of hsp90 and, to a lesser extent, hsp/hsc70 (hsc is the cognate, constitutive form). This induction was also observed in PBM from patients with chronic granulomatous disease, a genetic defect in NADPH oxidase, and was abolished by the PKC inhibitors staurosporine and H-7.

https://openalex.org/W1999806767,"Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is endoproteolytically processed to yield a family of mature secretory forms. These include an amino-terminal, a mid-region, and a carboxyl-terminal form. Prior studies suggested that the mid-region form is secreted via the regulated secretory pathway, whereas the amino- and carboxyl-terminal forms are secreted via the constitutive pathway. Further, PTHrP is unusual in that it is produced under normal circumstances by neuroendocrine cell types as well as by prototypical constitutively secreting cell types. The potential for cell-specific secretory pathway use by PTHrP has not been explored. Using immunohistochemical and perifusion techniques, we demonstrate that all three PTHrP daughter peptides are secreted via the regulated pathway in neuroendocrine cells. In contrast, all three daughter peptides are secreted in a constitutive fashion by non-neuroendocrine cells. Thus, the secretion of PTHrP is unique in that it appears to be cell-specific. When it is expressed in neuroendocrine cells that contain the regulated pathway, it is secreted in a regulated fashion; when it is expressed in non-neuroendocrine cells, it defaults to the constitutive pathway. This phenomenon has not previously been described for a polypeptide hormone in naturally occurring cells."

Although previous work has indicated a class of models in which several sequential steps are required for receptor inactivation, the rate-limiting event is still unclear. In this paper, we develop a theory that describes the kinetics of inactivation of the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin based on the rate of arrestin binding and test the theory using a combination of genetic and electrophysiological techniques in Drosophila photoreceptors. The theory quantitatively describes the inactivation kinetics of activated rhodopsin in vivo and can be independently tested with molecular and spectroscopic data. The results demonstrate that the rate of arrestin binding determines the kinetics of receptor inactivation in vivo and thus is the event that controls signal amplification at the first step of this G protein-coupled transduction cascade."

TPA treatment induces differentiation of K562 cells within 2-4 days after treatment. In this report, we show that transcriptional activation of the HMG-I/Y gene is dependent on protein synthesis and is an early event (2 h after induction) in the TPA-mediated differentiation process. Of the four functional transcription start sites present in the gene, only one (start site 2) is preferentially induced upon TPA treatment. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of the preferential utilization of a specific transcription start site in response to a particular stimulus in a gene that contains multiple promoters. This indicates that each start site in the gene has the potential to be independently regulated instead of being coordinately controlled as shown in a number of other genes. In addition, sequences upstream of the inducible start site, which contains a TPA-responsive element, mediates TPA inducibility through AP1 (or an AP1-like) transcription factor. The HMG-I/Y proteins function as key regulators of gene expression and play a significant role in chromatin structural changes as well. The cloning and sequence analyses previously reported indicated the structure of the HMG-I/Y gene to be highly complex and predicted its expression to be tightly regulated.

It is speculated that the carboxyl-terminal NBD may play a role in self-association of P-glycoprotein molecules in the plasma membrane."

It is a 22-kDa, apparently not glycosylated, integral membrane protein, which appears early during brain development and remains at high levels in the mature animal. Here, we describe the cDNA cloning of the porcine BM88 antigen and present evidence that this protein is involved in neuroblastoma cell differentiation. The deduced protein is a novel molecule consisting of 140 amino acids and bears a putative transmembrane domain at the COOH-terminal region. The mRNA of this protein is expressed only in neural tissues, where it is restricted to neurons. Stably transfected Neuro-2a cells overexpressing the BM88 antigen exhibited a significant change in morphology, reflected by enhanced process outgrowth, and a slower rate of division. Moreover, in the presence of differentiation agents, such as sucrose and retinoic acid, an accelerated differentiation of the transfected Neuro-2a cells was observed. Especially in the presence of sucrose, the consequent overexpression of the BM88 antigen in the transfected cells resulted in their enhanced morphological differentiation accompanied by the induction of neurofilament protein expression.

https://openalex.org/W1551668492,"Upon exposure to sustained and synchronized diurnal activity, most human variables exhibit rhythms with a 24 h period. The best-fitting cosine curve to the data with a selected period (24 h) may yield parameters like acrophase (estimated peak time), amplitude, and mesor (rhythm adjusted mean). The sequential array of the rhythms' acrophases constructs the temporal order. Analyzing 168 different human rhythms revealed a time-dependent distribution with regard to the number of acrophases/h and to the clustering of variables according to function. Rhythms' amplitude/mesor ratios yielded a five modal distribution. The modes occurred at those clock times where repetitive habitual signals are anticipated. It is assumed that these specific features evolved to optimize the adaptive value of the temporal order."
https://openalex.org/W1966413791,"To understand the molecular mechanisms that direct the expression of the gene encoding the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor, the 5′-flanking region of the human PAF receptor gene was cloned, and its promoter activity in myeloid cell lines was characterized. By the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method and primer extension, the transcription initiation site was mapped to an adenosine residue 137 bases upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon. The promoter region lacks a typical TATA or CCAAT box. However, the sequence encompassing the transcription initiation site shows high homology to the initiator (Inr) sequence. Transfection of promonocytic U937 cells with recombinant plasmids containing a series of truncated segments of the 5′-flanking region linked to the luciferase reporter gene revealed that the sequence from nucleotides −44 to +27 relative to the transcription initiation site was sufficient to promote a high level of gene expression. The promoter activity was much lower in nonexpressing HeLa cells and promyelocytic HL-60 cells, which express relatively low levels of the PAF receptor. Gel mobility shift analysis demonstrated the binding of nuclear factors extracted from myelocytic cells to the −16/+18 sequence containing the Inr element. No binding activity was detected using the nuclear extracts from the nonmyelocytic HeLa cells. The DNA-protein complexes were sequence-specific since the binding was not significantly affected by the mutated Inr sequences or the Inr sequence of the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase gene. Furthermore, point mutations in the Inr element significantly reduced promoter activity in both U937 and THP-1 cell lines. When Me2SO or retinoic acid was used to induce granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, a distinct Inr-protein complex was induced concurrently, but the complex was not observed in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced monocytic differentiated HL-60 cells or Me2SO-induced differentiated U937 cells, indicating that the inducible Inr binding activity is granulocyte-specific.

https://openalex.org/W2011154847,"Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II (CPSase II), aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase), and dihydroorotase (DHOase) catalyze the first three steps of de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, respectively. In mammalian species, these three enzyme activities exist in the cytosol in liver and other tissues as a multifunctional complex on a single polypeptide called carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase-aspartate transcarbamoylase-dihydroorotase (CAD) in the order of NH2-CPSase II-DHOase-ATCase-COOH. Previous studies provided evidence that in Squalus acanthias (spiny dogfish) these enzymes are not expressed in liver and that they exist as separate entities in the cytosol of extra-hepatic tissues such as testes and spleen (Anderson, P. M.(1989) Biochem. J. 261, 523-529). Here we report that the genes for these three enzymes are expressed in testes as a single transcript analogous to CAD in mammalian species and that these genes are not expressed in liver at levels that can be detected by Northern blots or by the polymerase chain reaction. The absence of the pyrimidine pathway in the liver may be related to the exclusive localization of glutamine synthetase in the mitochondrial matrix which provides for efficient assimilation of ammonia as glutamine for urea synthesis in these ureoosmotic species; thus glutamine may not be available for CPSase II or other amidotransferase activities in the cytosol. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the shark CAD cDNA reported here is very similar to CAD from other species; alignment with the hamster CAD sequence shows 77% identical residues.

Animal Physiology: Evolutionary and Ecological Perspectives. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar). CPSase I catalyzes carbamoyl phosphate formation as the first step of the urea cycle. CPSase I is present only in liver and small intestine, is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, utilizes ammonia as the nitrogen-donating substrate, and requires the presence of N-acetyl-L-glutamate as a positive allosteric effector for activity. Carbamoyl phosphate formation as the first step of the pyrimidine nucleotide pathway is catalyzed by CPSase II. CPSase II, in contrast to CPSase I, is present in liver as well as most other tissues, is localized in the cytosol, utilizes glutamine rather then ammonia as the nitrogen-donating substrate, does not require the presence of N-acetyl-L-glutamate for activity (and activity is not affected by the presence of N-acetyl-L-glutamate), and is subject to feedback inhibition by UTP and activation by 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. Furthermore, the CPSase II activity is physically linked at its C-terminal end to the third and second enzymes in the pyrimidine pathway, DHOase and ATCase, to form a multifunctional enzyme called CAD. The apparently typical hamster CAD is a single 243-kDa polypeptide with separate functional domains in the sequence NH2-CPSase II-DHOase-ATCase-COOH (Evans et al., 1993Evans D.R. Bein K. Guy H.I.

In ureoosmotic elasmobranch fishes (sharks, skates, and rays), carbamoyl phosphate formation in the urea cycle is catalyzed by a different type of CPSase, CPSase III (Anderson, 1980Anderson P.M. Science. 1980; 208: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, Anderson, 1991Anderson P.M. Biochem.

Academic Press, New York1995Google Scholar). The properties of CPSase III are very similar to those of CPSase I except that glutamine is utilized instead of ammonia as the nitrogen-donating substrate (Anderson, 1981Anderson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12228-12238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the predicted amino acid sequence based on the nucleotide sequence of the CPSase III cDNA from spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), a representative elasmobranch (hereafter referred to as shark), has a high degree of identity to the amino acid sequences of rat, human, and frog CPSase I (Hong et al., 1994Hong J. Salo W.L. Lusty C.J. Anderson P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition to the ureoosmotic elasmobranchs, CPSase III activity is present in certain teleost fishes and in invertebrates, and it has been suggested that CPSase III is an evolutionary intermediate between type II CPSases of lower eukaryotes and CPSase I of higher eukaryotes (Mommsen and Walsh, 1989Mommsen T.P. Walsh P.J. Science. 1989; 243: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar; Campbell and Anderson, 1991Campbell J.W. Anderson P.M. Hochachka P.W. Mommsen T.P.

In addition to the unique difference from the CPSases related to the urea cycle in higher vertebrates, our previous studies with spiny dogfish have indicated that the CPSase activity related to pyrimidine biosynthesis in elasmobranchs may also be different from the corresponding CPSase II activity in higher vertebrates (Anderson, 1989Anderson P.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The enzyme activities catalyzing the first three steps of the pyrimidine pathway (CPSase II, ATCase, and DHOase, respectively) along with glutamine synthetase are present in the cytosol of extracts of extra-hepatic tissues such as spleen and testes, but they elute as three separate entities during gel filtration chromatography, suggesting that the three genes may not be expressed as a single mRNA. In addition, the apparent absence of ATCase activity in liver extracts suggests that CPSase II activity and the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway may be expressed only in extra-hepatic tissues (Anderson, 1989Anderson P.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). CPSase II activity has also not been observed in liver extracts.2( 2P. M. Anderson, unpublished observations.) However, these studies are not conclusive, since 1) although precautions were taken to minimize proteolysis of linker regions between the domains of a CAD-like multifunctional enzyme, the presence of the three enzyme activities in extracts as separate polypeptide chains as a result of very active and/or specific protease activity cannot be excluded, 2) the presence of a CPSase II activity in liver may be difficult to detect because of the very high level of CPSase III activity in liver compared with the expected very low level of CPSase II activity, and 3) inability to detect ATCase in crude extracts does not definitively establish that the activity is not present. The study reported here was initiated to establish the nature of the CPSase II activity in spiny dogfish relative to that in higher eukaryotes. To our knowledge, characterization of the mRNA for any of the first three enzymes of the pyrimidine pathway has not been reported previously for any fish species. The results show that 1) the first three enzymes of the pyrimidine pathway are encoded as a single mRNA, which has a predicted amino acid sequence analogous to CAD; 2) the spiny dogfish CAD transcript is expressed in testes but not in liver; and 3) the transcript for CPSase III, as expected, is expressed in liver but not in testes. Freshly excised liver and testis tissue (1 g for each preparation) were immediately dropped into liquid nitrogen and then stored at −70°C. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using the FastTrack mRNA isolation kit from Invitrogen Corp. (San Diego, CA); the protocol provided with the kit was followed. The final concentrations of poly(A)+ RNA were measured by absorbance at 260 nm. Shark poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg of liver or testis) in 4 μl of water was heated for 3 min at 75°C in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube to disrupt the secondary structure and then rapidly cooled on ice and centrifuged. The denatured poly(A)+ RNA was then transferred to another 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing a 15-μl mixture of buffer, dNTPs, and oligo(dT) primer (Promega, Madison, WI). To this mixture was added 1 μl (200 units) of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The final composition of the reaction mixture was 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM dNTPs, 0.025 μg/μl of oligo(dT) primer, and 10 units/μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 40 min and at 42°C for an additional 30 min. Then 2 units of RNase H (Promega) were added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min at 37°C. After heating at 95°C for 5 min to inactivate the enzymes, the total volume was adjusted to 50 μl with water and the cDNA purified by passage through a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39-7.52Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the effluent (about 50 μl) was collected. All the water and tubes used in the cDNA synthesis were sterile and RNase-free. Three sets of consensus primers were designed based on the reported conserved amino acid sequences for CPSase (Simmer et al., 1990Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Rinker Jr., A.G. Scully J.L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10395-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ATCase (Simmer et al., 1989Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Scully J.L. Grayson D.R. Rinker Jr., A.G. Bergh S.T. Evans D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4382-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and DHOase (Quinn et al., 1991Quinn C.L. Stephenson B.T. Switzer R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9113-9127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): primers 1 and 2 for CPSase II, primers 3 and 4 for DHOase, and primers 5 and 6 for ATCase. The primers were synthesized using a PCR-Mate 391 DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequences of these primers are listed in Table I. These primers were used for the PCRs; the 50-μl reaction mixtures contained 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 (at 25°C), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mM of each of the four dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 pmol of each primer, 1 μl of the purified shark testis cDNA as template, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The program for amplifying the targeted CPSase II and ATCase sequences was: 1 cycle of 5 min at 94°C (denaturation), 1 min at 42°C (annealing), and 1 min at 72°C (extension); then 29 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 42°C, and 1 min at 72°C. For amplifying the targeted DHOase sequence, touchdown PCR (Don et al., 1991Don R.H. Cox P.T. Wainwright B.J. Baker K. Mattick J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar) was used in order to limit spurious priming. The first cycle included 5 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C. In each succeeding cycle, the denaturation step was maintained at 94°C for 1 min, but the annealing temperature was decreased by 2 degrees per cycle to a touchdown temperature of 45°C, where it remained for 25 more cycles. The extension time (at 72°C) was increased by 2 s/cycle throughout the entire PCR. All the PCRs were performed using a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer). The PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis using 4% Nusieve agarose (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) with Biomarker Low (BioVentures, Murfreesboro, TN) as standard. The PCR products of the appropriate sizes were cut out from the gel and cleaned with Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. The cleaned PCR products were then cloned into both pT7 Blue (R)-T vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and pCR-Script SK(+) cloning vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Novagen's vector has a T-overhang which is suitable for cloning PCR products with an A-overhang. On the other hand, Stratagene's vector is for cloning the blunt-end PCR products. Depending on the percentage of A-overhang (or blunt-end) PCR product in each reaction, it would be expected that one vector would work better than the other.Table ISequences of primers The plasmids with three different inserts were sequenced using primers specific for plasmid sequence flanking the inserts. Sequencing was carried out from one end of each strand toward the internal region of the insert. The primer walking strategy was used to obtain (as necessary) additional internal sequence until the overlapping sequence of the two complementary strands was obtained. Several clones were sequenced to reduce the possibility of incorrectly identifying mutations incorporated by Taq DNA polymerase as part of the sequence. Sequencing was carried out using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and employing 35S as a label (5′-[α-35S]dATP, 1000 Ci/mmol, purchased from Amersham Corp.). Three sets of specific primers were designed and synthesized based on the partial sequences obtained for CPSase II, ATCase, and DHOase. One set of primers specific for CPSase III has been described (Hong et al., 1994Hong J. Salo W.L. Lusty C.J. Anderson P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One μl of purified testis cDNA was used as template in each PCR reaction with primers specific for CPSase II, ATCase, and DHOase, respectively. One μl of purified liver cDNA was used as template in the PCR with primers specific for CPSase III. The PCR reactions were carried out as described above with consensus primers, except that the annealing temperature was increased. After confirming by agarose gel electrophoresis that only one major product of the correct predicted size was obtained in each reaction, the entire remaining reaction mixture was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, the desired band cut from the gel, and the DNA purified using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification system (Promega). The products were used as templates and reamplified by the PCR to give 32P-labeled probes; the dCTP concentration in the reaction mixtures was reduced to 0.016 mM, and 10 μl of 5′-[α -32P]dCTP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) was added. The 32P-labeled probes were purified by centrifugation through a Sephadex G-50 spin column. Oligomer-directed RNase H cleavage as described by Berger, 1987Berger S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar was used for mapping the shark testis mRNA. Shark testis poly(A)+ RNA (18 μg) was heated at 75°C for 3 min to disrupt secondary structure and then immediately cooled on ice. After a brief centrifugation to collect the liquid in the bottom of the centrifuge tube, 1 μl of a 25-base deoxyoligonucleotide (15 pmol/μl, Primer 10 in Table I) complementary to the DHOase mRNA sequence followed by 2 μl of 10 × Multicore Buffer (Promega) was added. After 5 min on ice, 2 μl of RNase H (1.5 units/μl, Promega) was added; this mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 min and then subjected to Northern blot analysis. Shark testis poly(A)+ RNA (5.4 μg), shark liver poly(A)+ RNA (5.4 μg), and RNase H-digested testis poly(A)+ RNA (9 μg) were electrophoresed in gel containing 0.8% formaldehyde (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39-7.52Google Scholar) with standard RNA molecular weight markers (0.36-9.49 kb, Promega) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane BioBlot-NC (Costar, Cambridge, MA) (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39-7.52Google Scholar). Each membrane was prehybridized in 25 ml of 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 50% formamide, 0.5% SDS, and 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42°C for 90 min. The 32P-labeled probe (about 50 μl) was heated with 125 μl of salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/ml) at 100°C for 5 min and then rapidly cooled on ice. The probe was then added to the prehybridization solution and hybridized at 42°C overnight. After hybridization, the membranes were washed twice (15 min each time) with 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS solution at room temperature, and then twice (8 min each time) with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS solution at 55°C before autoradiography. Tissue-specific expression of CAD and CPSase III genes in shark liver and testes was determined in two ways: Northern blot analysis and by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Northern blotting was carried out as described above. CAD expression was monitored using probes for CPSase II, DHOase, and ATCase. CPSase III expression was monitored using a probe for CPSase III. A more sensitive determination of expression was accomplished using RT-PCR. The synthesis of cDNA from liver or testis poly(A)+ RNA was carried out as described above. Primer sets were chosen to amplify long specific segments of CPSase III and CAD cDNA, but under conditions that would not amplify any possibly contaminating and much longer intron-laden genomic DNA. The primer set for CAD consisted of an upstream CPSase II-specific primer and a downstream ATCase-specific primer (primers 18 and 12, respectively, Table I), designed to yield a 5.1-kb PCR product. The primer set for CPSase III consisted of upstream and downstream primers (primers 20 and 21, respectively, Table I), designed to yield a 4.5-kb PCR product. Equal quantities of liver and testis cDNA (1 μl from 50 μl of effluent as described above) were used as templates for both the CPSase III-specific primer set and the CAD-specific primer set. Since other less sensitive methods have shown no expression of CAD gene in liver, it was important to determine what level of dilution of testis poly(A)+ RNA could be detected using the CAD-specific primers. To determine this, 1 μl of liver cDNA was mixed with 1 μl of a serial dilution of testis cDNA, from 1:10 to 1:100,000, and these mixtures were used as templates for the PCR employing CAD-specific primers. Some modifications in the PCR described by Barnes, 1994Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar to amplify long sequences of DNA (Barnes, 1994Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For the PCRs using the CAD-specific primer set, the program was: 1 cycle of 5 min at 94°C, 1 min at 54°C, and 10 min at 72°C; 28 cycles of 0.5 min at 94°C, 1 min at 54°C, and 10 min at 72°C with an increase of 10 s each cycle; 1 cycle of 0.5 min at 94°C, 1 min at 54°C, and 30 min at 72°C. The program for the PCRs using the CPSase III-specific primer set was similar except that the annealing temperature was increased to 60°C. The sequencing strategy for the entire shark CAD cDNA is shown in Fig. 1. The primers used are listed in Table I. Primers 8-13 and 18 are specific primers based on regions of DNA sequenced as described above (segments 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 as shown in Fig. 1). Primers 7 and 9 are consensus primers based on the conserved regions apparent from the three known CAD sequences from hamster (Simmer et al., 1990Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Rinker Jr., A.G. Scully J.L.

Biochem. 1989; 179: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Touchdown PCR was carried out to obtain DNA between primers 7 and 8 and between primers 9 and 10. One μl of purified shark testis cDNA was used as template in each reaction. The segment between primers 11 and 12 was amplified by standard PCR procedures. The cDNA corresponding to the 3′-UTR and part of the ATCase sequence of shark CAD mRNA (piece 13-14 in Fig. 1) was amplified by 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR. The template for 3′ RACE PCR was 1 μl of testis cDNA synthesized from primer 19, the lock-docking primer (Borson et al., 1992Borson N.D. Salo W.L. Drewes L.R. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) following the same procedures as described above. The primers for 3′ RACE PCR were primers 13 and 14 (a specific primer for the multiple cloning site of primer 19). The PCR products (pieces 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, and 13-14) were purified from the gel, cloned, and sequenced as described above for pieces 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6. One clone containing each PCR product was sequenced. To obtain cDNA sequence toward the extreme 5′ end of the mRNA, 5′ RACE PCR was employed. First strand testis cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg of testis mRNA as template and 25 pmol of primer 16 (designed based on the sequence obtained from piece 7-8) as primer following the procedure described above. The final volume was about 50 μl. Purified first strand cDNA (46 μl) was added along with 12 μl of 5 × terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase buffer (500 mM cacodylate (pH 6.8), 5 mM CoCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol), 2 μl 10 mM dATP, and 2 μl of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (20 units/μl, Promega). After incubation at 37°C for 15 min and then at 65°C for 15 min to denature the enzyme, the reaction mixture was applied to and eluted from a Sephadex G-50 column. One μl of the effluent was used as template in the first round of 5′ RACE PCR. Lock-docking primer 19 (50 pmol) and 50 pmol of primer 17, which is nested to primer 16 and designed on the basis of the sequence of piece 7-8, were used as primers. The program was: 1 cycle of 5 min at 94°C, 1 min at 37°C, and 1 min and 15 s at 72°C (the ramp time between 37 and 72°C was set at 1 min to minimize the detachment of the lock-docking primer); then 24 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 37°C, and 1 min and 15 s at 72°C (the ramp time between 37 and 72°C remained 1 min, and the extension time increased 3 s every cycle). For the second round of 5′ RACE PCR, 1 μl of the first round product was used as template, and 50 pmol each of primers 14 and 15 (a primer nested to primer 17 and designed based on the sequence of piece 7-8) were used as primers. The PCR product (piece 14-15) was purified from the gel by Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification system (Promega) and directly sequenced by the cycle sequencing method using fmol DNA sequencing system (Promega); the manufacturer's protocol was followed. Primer 14 and sequencing primers (not listed) nested to primer 15 were used in the cycle sequencing and labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, Amersham). The sequence from both strands of DNA was obtained. To obtain the remaining sequence of shark CAD cDNA, the 5.1-kb PCR product (piece 12-18, Fig. 1) was purified from the gel by Gelase (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) digestion and then precipitation by addition of ethanol following the manufacturer's instructions. The cycle sequencing method was applied as described above. The sequencing primers (not listed) nested to primers 12 and 18 were used in the cycle sequencing to obtain sequence from both strands and the primer walking strategy (primers not listed) was used to advance the sequencing until the overlapping sequence of the two complementary strands was obtained. The sequence data were analyzed using the GCG sequence analysis software package version 7 of the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group. Using shark testis cDNA as template for the PCR, products of 580, 590, and 220 base pairs were obtained using consensus primers for CPSase II, DHOase, and ATCase, respectively. The size of the products corresponded to the respective predicted sizes based on the reported cDNA sequences between the respective consensus primers for these enzymes from other species. The base sequences of these products were determined, and the predicted amino acid sequences were found to compare favorably with the corresponding regions of the previously published sequences. For example, these sequences were found to have 83, 71, and 81% identity with the corresponding sequences of hamster CAD CPSase II, DHOase, and ATCase, respectively. However, in each case, unique sequences not found in any of the other enzymes were present in each product. The shark CPSase II region shares high identity (67%) with the corresponding region of shark CPSase III, but the fact that they are different excludes the possibility that the product was derived from CPSase III mRNA. These results strongly indicate that the products of the PCR using the consensus primers represent partial sequences for shark CPSase II, DHOase, and ATCase, respectively. Based on these sequences, 32P-labeled probes specific for shark CPSase II, DHOase, and ATCase were then prepared by the PCR using testis cDNA as template and three different sets of specific primers. These probes were then used for Northern blot analysis and RNase H mapping. As shown in Fig. 2A (lane 2), B (lane 1), and C (lane 2), Northern blot analysis revealed a predominant band of the same size when poly(A)+ RNA from shark testis was hybridized with either of the three different probes specific for shark CPSase II, DHOase, and ATCase, respectively. The large size of the transcript (about 8.8 kb) is similar to that of the 7.5-kb hamster CAD transcript (Bein et al., 1991Bein K. Simmer J.P. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3791-3799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results provide strong evidence that these three enzymes are expressed as a single transcript analogous to CAD. We also observed that the ATCase- and CPSase II-specific probes hybridized to a single transcript of about 14 kb in one Northern blot experiment using mRNA from another individual shark.3( 3W. L. Salo, unpublished observation.) The explanation for this observed difference in transcript size is not known but could be the result of multiple transcription termination sites, alternative splicing, or RNA degradation. The results of RNase H mapping provided confirming evidence that the three enzymes a"

INTRODUCTIONThe process of signal transduction from surface tyrosine kinase receptors to the nucleus is mainly regulated by mechanisms of reversible protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Increasing attention has been focused recently on the family of protein tyrosine phosphatases involved in signaling pathways and regulation of cell proliferation (1Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 463-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 2Walton K.M. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Dual specificity phosphatases constitute a novel subfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases characterized by their ability to dephosphorylate not only Tyr but also Ser/Thr residues in substrates in vitro. The first described member in this subfamily, cdc25, is known to activate the p34cdc2-cyclin kinase complex that regulates entry into the M phase, through dephosphorylation of specific Tyr and Thr residues (3Millar J.B. Russell P. Cell. 1992; 68: 407-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A number of other dual specificity phosphatases have been recently described (4Guan K. Broyles S.S.

While some of these have been shown to dephosphorylate MAP1( 1The abbreviations used are: MAPmicrotubule-associated proteinGVBDgerminal vesicle breakdownMPFmaturation promotion factorGSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMBPmyelin basic protein.) kinase in vivo or in vitro(10Ward Y.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 143-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).VHR is a dual specificity phosphatase recently isolated in our laboratory by means of expression cloning (14Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 89: 12170-12174Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Searches of available data bases have failed to identify significant similarity between VHR and other protein tyrosine phosphatases, except for a motif, HCXXXXGR, which seems to constitute the catalytic core common to all protein tyrosine phosphatases (9Hannon G.J. Casso D. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 89: 12170-12174Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 15Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). In fact, cdc25 is more similar in sequence to VH1 and VHR than to the other phosphatases (16Keyse S.M. Ginsburg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 377-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Also, in contrast to most other members of the dual specificity protein tyrosine phosphatase subfamily, VHR exhibits broad substrate specificity in vitro(14Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 89: 12170-12174Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). No physiological role is yet known for this newly identified protein tyrosine phosphatase.Xenopus oocytes are arrested at the G2/M transition of the first meiotic prophase. Progesterone or insulin induces these cells to enter metaphase and undergo meiotic maturation involving germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), in a process that involves significant changes in cellular phosphorylation (17Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1989; 246: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 18Maller J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3157-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Most of the phosphorylations associated with GVBD are triggered by activation of maturation promoting factor (MPF), a universal regulator of M phase transition in eukaryotic cells (19Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar, 20Pines J. Hunter T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 389-401PubMed Google Scholar). MPF is is a complex composed of p34cdc2 (a serine-threonine protein kinase) and B cyclin (18Maller J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3157-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar, 20Pines J. Hunter T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 389-401PubMed Google Scholar) whose kinase activity is up-regulated by cdc25, a dual specificity phosphatase (3Millar J.B. Russell P. Cell. 1992; 68: 407-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates also that MAP kinase kinase and MAP kinase are essential elements in the cascade of phosphorylations culminating in MPF activation and oocyte maturation (21Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Santos E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 467-477PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kosako H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2131-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Xenopus oocytes possess at least two independent pathways of MPF activation through phosphorylation. In one, progesterone leads to decreased adenylate cyclase activity with a resulting drop in overall cAMP levels and protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylations. In the other, insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 triggers a cascade of phosphorylations initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of their receptors (17Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1989; 246: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 18Maller J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3157-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Ras and other oncogenic proteins also have been shown to induce meiotic maturation when microinjected into Xenopus oocytes (21Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Santos E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 467-477PubMed Google Scholar, 23Birchmeier C. Broek D. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 43: 615-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 24Sagata N. Oskarsson M.

Morrison D.K. Daar I.O. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that Ras proteins are essential components in insulin-induced maturation (29Deshpande A.K. Kung H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30Korn L.J. Siebel C.W. McCormick F. Roth R.A.

A. 1989; 86: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The universality of MPF and the possibility of activating it by microinjection of various oncogene products into Xenopus oocytes makes this a very useful experimental model for the analysis of the role of various cellular gene products in progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle. In the present study we utilized the Xenopus oocyte system in order to investigate possible in vivo function(s) of VHR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOocyte Preparation and MicroinjectionAdult female Xenopus laevis were obtained from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI) and stimulated to ovulate by microinjecting 50 units of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (Calbiochem) 3 days before oocyte extraction. Ovarian fragments were surgically removed from frogs anesthetized by hypothermia. Fully grown stage VI oocytes were manually dissected into ND-96 medium (5 mM Hepes, 96 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, pH 7.8, and 10 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin sulfate). The oocytes were allowed to recover overnight in the same buffer before further treatment and were always maintained at 20°C.For induction of meiotic maturation, groups of 10-30 oocytes were incubated in ND-96 without KCl in the presence of progesterone (15 μM; Sigma) or insulin (7.5 μM; Sigma) or were microinjected into the cytoplasm with 30-60 nl of normal or mutant VHR (1 mg/ml, in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Controls were microinjected with buffer. Meiotic maturation was assayed by scoring the disappearance of the nucleus (GVBD) in oocytes fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid. In most cases, the absence of the nucleus correlated with the appearance of a white spot in the animal pole.VHR Protein Expression and PurificationPlasmid pGEX-VHR, a pGEX-KT-derived expression vector (32Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), was used to express wild-type and mutant VHR as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Expression and purification of GST-VHR were essentially as previously described (14Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 89: 12170-12174Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). GST-VHR and GST-VHR (C124S) were >98% pure as determined by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. VHR proteins obtained by thrombin cleavage of purified GST fusion protein as described elsewhere (14Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 89: 12170-12174Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar) were then dialyzed extensively against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and stored at high protein concentration at −80°C. No loss of enzymatic activity occurred during long term storage under those conditions. For microinjection, the proteins were used at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in all assays.Preparation of Oocyte LysatesLysates of VHR-microinjected oocytes were prepared as previously described (21Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Santos E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 467-477PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (20 μl/oocyte) containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM β-glycerophosphate, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin.Concentrated, cell-free lysates from untreated oocytes for in vitro assays were prepared essentially as previously described (34Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1992; 36: 581-605Crossref Scopus (800) Google Scholar), with some minor modifications. Stage VI oocytes were washed 10 times in cytostatic factor extraction buffer (CSF-XB, 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes-potassium, pH 7.7, 50 mM sucrose, 5 mM EGTA, pH 7.7) and then twice in the same buffer containing protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin, 10 μg/ml each). The oocytes were then transferred to SW50.1Ti ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman) containing CSF-XB buffer plus protease inhibitors and 100 μg/ml cytochalasin B and spun at 1000 rpm at room temperature for 60 s and then 30 s at 2000 rpm. After removing all CSF-XB, a crushing spin was performed at 30,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. The cytoplasmic layer was then collected by using a needle and syringe via side puncture. Protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin, 10 μg/ml each), 100 μg/ml cytochalasin B, 0.05 volume of CSF-energy mix (150 mM creatine phosphate, 20 mM ATP, 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.7, 20 mM MgCl2) and 0.2 M sucrose were then added to this cytoplasmic fraction. The final protein concentration of these extracts was approximately 80 mg/ml.Protein Kinase AssaysFor measurement of GVBD-associated kinases in VHR-microinjected oocytes, histone H1 kinase was assayed essentially as described elsewhere (21Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Santos E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 467-477PubMed Google Scholar). 5 μl of clarified extracts were incubated in a final volume of 15 μl with 3 μg of exogenous histone (type III-S calf thymus; Sigma), 100 μM cold ATP, and 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) for 15 min at room temperature. Phosphorylated histone H1 was visualized by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE on 10-20% gels, and radioactivity in the histone H1 bands was quantitated on the whole gels with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase assay was performed as described elsewhere (35Erikson E. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 264: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), but using 1 mg/ml of MBP peptide substrate (UBI) in the presence of protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (7 μM; Life Technologies, Inc.). 5 μl of oocyte extracts were incubated with 35 μl of reaction buffer at 30°C for 10 min and then spotted on P81 filters (Whatman), washed, and counted using Biofluor as scintillation liquid.Protein kinase activation in highly concentrated cell-free extracts incubated in the presence of exogenous VHR was assayed basically as follows. 6 μl of purified VHR protein (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 22 μl of extract prepared as described above and and 1 μl of ATP-regenerating buffer (20 μM creatine phosphate, 2 mM ATP, 5 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase; Sigma). After mixing on ice, extract samples were incubated at 21°C, and equal aliquots were removed at different times and diluted with an equal volume of extraction buffer buffer B (EB; 80 mM β-glycerophosphate, 20 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl2 in 10 mM Hepes-potassium, pH 7.7) before performing kinase assays.Histone H1 kinase and MBP kinase assays were performed following described procedures (36Smythe C. Newport J. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 449-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) after diluting the samples 60 or 100 times, respectively, in buffer B. MAP kinase activation was also determined by assays of mobility shift in Western immunoblots (10% SDS-PAGE gels) done using anti-rat MAP kinase R2 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. catalog no. 06-182).RESULTSMicroinjected VHR Protein Induces Slow Meiotic Maturation of Xenopus OocytesA purified, bacterially expressed 20-kDa polypeptide encoded by the VHR gene (14Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 89: 12170-12174Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar) was injected into full-grown X. laevis oocytes, and its biological effects were evaluated. The injected protein was highly stable and detectable in the cytosol of the injected oocytes using specific antibodies, even after 30 h of microinjection (not shown). Interestingly, we observed that injection of VHR resulted in GVBD after rather prolonged incubation times (Fig. 1A). Typically, the start of GVBD induced by VHR was significantly delayed (by about 10 h) as compared to progesterone or insulin. In addition, VHR-induced GVBD was variable in intensity, occasionally reaching 100% maturation, but most often remaining in the range 60-70% (Fig. 1A). The induction of GVBD by microinjected VHR was reproducible and dependent on its enzymatic activity since injection of buffer or an inactive mutant (Cys124→ Ser) that lacks phosphatase activity (14Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 89: 12170-12174Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar) failed to produce maturation under similar experimental conditions (Fig. 1A).The process of GVBD induced by VHR was also highly dependent on the concentration of VHR present in the injected oocytes. No GVBD was observed when less than 30 ng of purified VHR were injected (not shown).Synergism between Hormones and VHR in Induction of GVBD in X. laevis OocytesXenopus oocytes possess at least two distinct pathways that eventually converge in activation of the MPF kinase complex and subsequent GVBD. In one, progesterone down-regulates the oocyte adenylate cyclase activity and subsequent protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylations. In the other, insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 triggers cascades of phosphorylation initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the specific receptor (17Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1989; 246: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 18Maller J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3157-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate the participation of Ras in insulin-induced maturation (29Deshpande A.K. Kung H.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30Korn L.J. Siebel C.W. McCormick F. Roth R.A. Science. 1987; 236: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Gibbs J.B. Schaber M.D. Schofield T.L. Scolnick E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).In order to determine if VHR could interact with components of any of these pathways, we microinjected VHR in oocytes that were also treated with either insulin or progesterone. As shown in Fig. 1B, microinjected VHR produced a marked acceleration in the rate of GVBD induced by either progesterone or insulin at a variety of concentrations of either hormone. The synergistic effect of VHR was most obvious when suboptimal concentrations of either hormone were used (Fig. 1B presents results obtained using 1/10 and 1/100 of the optimal concentrations for insulin and progesterone, respectively). The synergism between hormone-induced maturation and VHR is in contrast to the behavior shown by several other phosphatases, which block hormone-induced GVBD and/or kinase activation (6Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020PubMed Google Scholar, 37Tonks N.K. Cicirelli M.F. Diltz C.D. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The GVBD-inducing activity of VHR and its cooperation with both progesterone and insulin are consistent with a model whereby VHR might act at a late biochemical step, common to both progesterone- and insulin-initiated pathways of GVBD.In Vivo Activation of Intracellular Kinases in VHR-microinjected OocytesIt has been shown previously that cascades of phosphorylation involving activation of MAP kinase and the cdc2 kinase component of MPF are essential for the process of GVBD induced by insulin or progesterone (21Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Santos E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 467-477PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kosako H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2131-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 38Shibuya E.

We showed that microinjected Ras proteins can activate these kinases, even in the absence of protein synthesis, in a process in which the peak of activation of MAP kinase precedes the peak of activation of the p34cdc2 kinase component of MPF (19Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar, 20Pines J. Hunter T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 389-401PubMed Google Scholar), as measured as histone H1 kinase activity (21Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Santos E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 467-477PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, purified Ras proteins have been shown to activate MAP kinase in vitro when added to oocyte cell-free extracts (19Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar, 38Shibuya E. Polverino A.J. Chang E. Wigler M. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).We sought to analyze activation of early and late acting kinases during the process of GVBD induced by microinjected VHR. Fig. 2 presents results obtained in experiments in which the kinetics of GVBD (Panel A), the kinetics of activation of the MAP kinase (Panels D and E) and the p34cdc2 kinase (assayed as histone H1 kinase activity, Panels B and C) were analyzed in parallel.Figure 2:Kinetics of in vivo activation of histone H1 and MAP kinase in oocytes microinjected with VHR. Representative experiment determining the kinetics of GVBD (Panel A) and parallel activation of cytoplasmic kinases (histone H1 kinase, Panels B and C; MBP kinase, Panels D and E) in VHR-injected oocytes. Similar results were obtained in two more separate experiments. A, time course of GVBD in oocytes microinjected with 50 ng of VHR. B, histone H1 kinase assay in cytosolic extracts of oocytes microinjected with VHR (15 oocytes used per each time point). Kinase activity is shown in arbitrary units, normalized to the activity (PhosphorImager signal) detected in control untreated oocytes at time 0. The maximal H1 kinase peak is coincident with the beginning of oocyte maturation (see Panel A). For comparison purposes, control oocytes had 4314 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) units, with a blank of 186 PhosphorImager units for the same sample. C, autoradiogram of the same H1 kinase assays analyzed in Panel B, performed on a 4-20% PAGE-SDS minigel. Mobility position of histone H1 protein band is indicated by the arrow. D, MBP kinase in 5 μl of clarified extract (15 oocytes used per each time point), performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results presented as -fold increase, normalizing all values to radioactivity incorporated in sample of control, untreated oocytes at time 0. Blank values substracted from all samples were obtained by performing the kinase assays in the absence of the exogenously added substrate. For comparison purposes, control untreated oocytes gave 5154 cpm, with a blank of 3528 cpm for the same sample.

Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar, 20Pines J. Hunter T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 389-401PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Santos E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 467-477PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that the rapid increase in H1 kinase activity coincided with the onset of oocyte maturation triggered by microinjected VHR (compare Fig. 2, A, with B and C). Also as described previously for hormone-matured oocytes (39Yew N. Mellini M.L. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), H1 kinase activity of oocytes induced to mature by VHR peaked at GVBD and then fell to a minimum before gradually rising again, suggesting that the VHR-injected oocytes underwent a complete meiotic maturation process (39Yew N. Mellini M.L. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).The process of VHR-induced GVBD was also accompanied by the significant activation of MAP kinase activity that could be detected either by direct kinase assays of oocyte lysates (Fig. 2D) or by mobility-shift assays using specific antibodies against the 42-kDa MAP kinase molecule (Fig. 2E). In contrast to hormone-treated- or Ras-injected oocytes, in which the peak of MAP kinase activation clearly precedes histone H1 kinase activation (21Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Santos E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 467-477PubMed Google Scholar), the peak of MAP kinase activation in VHR-injected oocytes (Fig. 2C) occurred several hours after maximal histone H1 kinase activity was already achieved, coinciding, in fact, with a minimum in the histone H1 kinase activity (compare Fig. 2, B and C).In Vitro Activation of Kinases by VHR Protein Exogenously Added to Cell-free Oocyte LysatesThe linkage of the GVBD-inducing ability of VHR to its phosphatase activity (Fig. 1) and the unusual kinetics of kinase activation accompanying this process (Fig. 2) suggested that VHR might be acting directly at the level of activation of MPF, mimicking in a sense the action of cdc25, another dual specificity phosphatase known to be the physiological activator of the p34cdc2 kinase activity in the MPF complex during this G2/M transition (3Millar J.B.

In order to test this hypothesis, we to sought determine whether purified VHR could activate MPF kinase in vitro, when added to highly concentrated cell-free oocyte extracts.Under experimental conditions similar to those used with Ras and Mos (11Nebreda A.R.
