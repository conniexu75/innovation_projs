https://openalex.org/W1985700603,"GTP gamma S irreversibly inhibits protein transport between successive compartments of the Golgi stack in a cell-free system. Fluoride, potentiated by the addition of aluminum ion, also causes a strong inhibition. These are hallmarks of the involvement of a guanine nucleotide-binding or regulatory ""G"" protein. Inhibition by GTP gamma S requires a cytosolic inhibitory factor that binds to Golgi membranes during inhibition. Preincubation experiments reveal that GTP gamma S blocks the function of acceptor Golgi but not donor Golgi membranes. More specifically, a processing step in between vesicle attachment and the actual fusion event seems to be affected. Electron microscopy demonstrates a corresponding 5-fold accumulation of non-clathrin-coated buds and vesicles associated with the Golgi cisternae during inhibition by GTP gamma S."
https://openalex.org/W2070661904,"To investigate the mechanism by which immune activation augments replication of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in infected T cells, four different classes of T cell mitogens were evaluated for their effects on the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a mitogenic lectin; phorbol 12-myristic 13-acetate, a tumor promoter; ionomycin, a calcium ionophore; and tat-1, the trans-activator protein from the human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) each stimulated the HIV-1 LTR. Studies of deleted forms of the LTR supported a central role in these responses for the HIV-1 enhancer, which alone was sufficient for mitogen inducibility, but also suggested that other 5' positive and negative regulatory elements contribute to the overall magnitude of the response. Synergistic activation of the HIV-1 LTR (up to several thousandfold) was observed with combinations of these mitogens and the HIV-1--derived tat-III protein. Cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive agent, inhibited PHA-mediated activation of the HIV-1 LTR but was without effect in the presence of other mitogens. Thus, HIV-1 gene expression and replication appear to be regulated, via the HIV-1 LTR, by the same mitogenic signals that induce T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2088023367,"Growth factors and their receptors are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and also play a key role in oncogenesis. In this study, a novel putative kinase receptor gene, termed eph, has been identified and characterized by molecular cloning. Its primary structure is similar to that of tyrosine kinase receptors thus far cloned and includes a cysteine-rich region in the extracellular domain. However, other features of the sequence distinguish the eph gene product from known receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. Thus the eph protein may define a new class of these molecules. The eph gene is overexpressed in several human carcinomas, suggesting that this gene may be involved in the neoplastic process of some tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2165922683,"We investigated the import and sorting pathways of cytochrome b2 and cytochrome c1, which are functionally located in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. Both proteins are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes as larger precursors and are processed in mitochondria in two steps upon import. The precursors are first translocated across both mitochondrial membranes via contact sites into the matrix. Processing by the matrix peptidase leads to intermediate-sized forms, which are subsequently redirected across the inner membrane. The second proteolytic processing occurs in the intermembrane space. We conclude that the hydrophobic stretches in the presequences of the intermediate-sized forms do not stop transfer across the inner membrane, but rather act as transport signals to direct export from the matrix into the intermembrane space."
https://openalex.org/W1995699883,"The intracellular site for the sorting of proteins destined for regulated or constitutive pathways is presently unknown for any one cell. By immunoelectron microscopy, we directly followed the routes taken by a regulated hormone, insulin, and a constitutive protein, hemagglutinin. Both proteins are present in individual Golgi stacks where they appear randomly distributed throughout the cisternae. In contrast, the two proteins do not colocalize outside the Golgi area:insulin is concentrated in dense-core secretory granules, while hemagglutinin is found predominantly in clear 100-300 nm vesicles. These vesicles do not label significantly with an endocytic tracer, indicating that they are exocytic carriers for hemagglutinin. The site at which the two proteins diverge is the clathrin-coated, trans-most cisterna of the Golgi, where the packaging of proinsulin takes place."
https://openalex.org/W1976039017,"Transcriptional activation by the yeast CYC1 upstream activation site UAS2UP1 requires the products of both the HAP2 and HAP3 regulatory genes. We show here that both HAP2 and HAP3 in yeast extracts bind to UAS2UP1 and give rise to a single protein-DNA complex, termed C, in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. That both products are a part of complex C was shown by altering the mobility of the complex by fusing either HAP2 or HAP3 to beta-galactosidase. Further, methylation interference footprinting showed that sequences in UAS2UP1 contacted in complex C were identical to those contacted in either fusion protein complex. Binding was centered on the sequence TGATTGGT, also found in the UASs of other genes subject to activation by the HAP2-HAP3 system and homologous to the CCAAT box sequence found in higher cells. The binding of either HAP2 or HAP3 was abolished when synthesized in a strain mutant in the complementary HAP gene. Thus the binding of HAP2 and HAP3 to UAS2UP1 is interdependent. The involvement of multiple gene products in binding to a single site is discussed with reference to other systems in yeast and higher cells."

https://openalex.org/W2077177261,"In eukaryotic cells, the conversion of gene transcripts into messenger RNA's involves multiple factors, including the highly abundant small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes that mediate the splicing reaction. Separable factors are also required for the 3' end processing of histone pre-mRNA's. The two conserved signals flanking the 3' cleavage site are recognized by discrete components present in active HeLa cell extracts: the upstream stem loop associates with a nuclease-insensitive factor, while binding to the downstream element is mediated by a component having the properties of a snRNP. The sequence of the RNA moiety of the low abundance human U7 snRNP suggests how the relatively degenerate downstream element of mammalian pre-mRNA's could be recognized by RNA base-pairing."

https://openalex.org/W1521934005,"15-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), a major lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid in fetal bovine aortic endothelial cells, was a mitogen for these cells, stimulating both cell proliferation and DNA synthesis in the presence of serum and serum-deprived cells. In [14C]arachidonic acid-labeled confluent endothelial cell monolayers, 15-HETE (30 microM) caused an elevation of [14C]diacylglycerol (DAG) with a concomitant decrease in cellular [14C]phosphatidylinositol (PI) in both unstimulated and stimulated cells. 1-Oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, a synthetic DAG analog, stimulated endothelial cell DNA synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. In [3H]inositol-labeled cells, 15-HETE also caused a decrease in cellular PI content under both basal and stimulated conditions. 15-HETE, however, had no effect on either isolated phospholipase C activity or phosphoinositide turnover in lithium chloride-treated cells. In intact cells, 15-HETE (30 microM) inhibited the synthesis of [3H]PI from [3H]inositol (80% inhibition, p less than 0.001). In human red cell membranes, the production of phosphatidic acid from endogenous DAG was inhibited by 15-HETE in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 41 microM. Although 12-HETE had effects similar to those of 15-HETE, the parent compound arachidonic acid did not affect DNA synthesis or DAG kinase activity. Our study thus demonstrates that the mitogenic activity of 15- and 12-HETE on endothelial cells may be mediated via DAG kinase inhibition with the concomitant accumulation of cellular DAG."
https://openalex.org/W1580941607,"We have sequenced a cDNA, isolated from a chick embryo fibroblast lambda gt11 library, that encodes all 887 amino acids of alpha-actinin. Sequence from 10 different peptides from chick smooth muscle alpha-actinin was found to match that derived from the cDNA. The deduced protein sequence can be divided into three distinct domains: (a) the N-terminal 240 amino acid contains a highly conserved region (compared with Dictyostelium alpha-actinin) which probably represents the actin-binding domain, (b) amino acids 270-740 contain four repeats of a spectrin-like sequence, and (c) the C-terminal sequence contains two EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites. Each of these sites is defective in at least one oxygen-containing Ca2+-chelating amino acid side chain, suggesting that they are nonfunctional. Southern blots suggest that the alpha-actinin cDNA described here hybridizes to only one gene in chicken. Northern blots reveal only one size class of mRNA in fibroblasts and smooth muscle, but no hybridizing species could be detected in skeletal muscle poly(A+) RNA. The results are consistent with the view that smooth and skeletal muscle alpha-actinins are encoded by separate genes, which are considerably divergent."

https://openalex.org/W1517396783,"The grpE gene of Escherichia coli was first identified because a mutation in it, grpE280, prevented bacteriophage lambda DNA replication in vivo. Subsequent work resulted in the identification of the grpE protein in two-dimensional gels and its classification as a heat shock protein. Here we report the purification of the grpE protein. We show that overproduction of grpE occurs in dnaK 103 bacteria which do not produce a functional Mr 72,000 dnaK protein. The grpE protein was purified from this strain primarily by its specific retention on a dnaK affinity column. The interaction between these two proteins, which is stable in the presence of 2 M KCl, allowed other proteins to be washed from this column. grpE was then eluted by ATP, which disrupts the interaction. During purification, grpE activity was monitored by its ability to complement an in vitro lambda dv DNA replication system dependent on the lambda O and lambda P proteins. The effect of ATP on the dnaK-grpE complex was also observed during sedimentation of the two proteins in glycerol gradients. Purified grpE protein has a Mr of approximately 23,000 under both denaturing and native conditions, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sedimentation, respectively. However, in the presence of dnaK under native conditions, grpE cosediments with dnaK. When ATP is added to the gradient, the complex is disrupted, and the two proteins sediment independently as monomers."
https://openalex.org/W1530935792,"Desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor, a receptor which is coupled to the stimulation of adenylate cyclase, may be regulated via phosphorylation by a unique protein kinase. This recently discovered enzyme, known as the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, only phosphorylates the agonist-occupied form of the beta-adrenergic receptor. To assess whether receptors coupled to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase might also be substrates, we examined the effects of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase on the partially purified human platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptor. Phosphorylation of the reconstituted alpha 2-adrenergic receptor was dependent on agonist occupancy and was completely blocked by coincubation with alpha 2-antagonists. The time course of phosphorylation of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor was virtually identical to that observed with the beta-adrenergic receptor with maximum stoichiometries of 7-8 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor in each case. In contrast, the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, which is coupled to stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, is not a substrate for the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase. These results suggest that receptors coupled to either stimulation or inhibition of adenylate cyclase may be regulated by an agonist-dependent phosphorylation mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1581920727,"Abstract The relationship between the concentration of Mg2+ and the binding of GDP and GTP to tubulin dimers was investigated by measuring the displacement of the nucleotide bound at the exchangeable site (E-site) by radiolabeled GDP and GTP. A wide range of concentrations of GTP, GDP, and Mg2+ was explored. In the near absence of Mg2+, the affinity of tubulin for GDP was found to be much greater than its affinity for GTP. In the presence of 1.0 mM Mg2+, however, its affinity for GDP was slightly less than for GTP. The results could be quantitatively described in terms of a small number of reversible equilibria. Equilibrium constants, pertaining to measurements at 0 degrees C, in 0.1 M piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid), 0.2 mM dithioerythritol, 2 mM EGTA, pH 6.9, were obtained by nonlinear least squares fitting of the data. When the association constant of tubulin for GDP uncomplexed with Mg2+ was taken to be 1.6 X 10(7) M-1, that for uncomplexed GTP was found to be no larger than 1.4 x 10(4) M-1, at least 1100-fold smaller. The association constant of tubulin for the GDP.Mg2+ complex was found to be 2.5-2.7 x 10(7) M-1, while that for the GTP.Mg2+ complex is 6.4-9.0 x 10(7) M-1."
https://openalex.org/W1964064071,"A new human retrovirus was isolated from a continuous cell line derived from a patient with CD4+ Tac- cutaneous T cell lymphoma/leukemia. This virus is related to but distinct from human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus types I and II (HTLV-I and HTLV-II) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). With the use of a fragment of provirus cloned from one patient with T cell leukemia, closely related sequences were found in DNA of the cell line and of tumor cells from seven other patients with the same disease; these sequences were only distantly related to HTLV-I. The phenotype of the cells and the clinical course of the disease were clearly distinguishable from leukemia associated with HTLV-I. All patients and the wife of one patient showed a weak serological cross-reactivity with both HTLV-I and HIV-1 antigens. None of the patients proved to be at any apparent risk for HIV-1 infection. The name proposed for this virus is HTLV-V, and the date indicate that it may be a primary etiological factor in the major group of cutaneous T cell lymphomas/leukemias, including the sporadic lymphomas known as mycoses fungoides."
https://openalex.org/W1493556845,"The OCT plasmid encodes enzymes for alkane hydroxylation and alkanol dehydrogenation. Structural components are encoded on the 7.5-kilobase pair alkBAC operon, whereas positive regulatory components are encoded by alkR. We have constructed plasmids containing fusions of cloned alkBAC and alkR DNA and used these fusion plasmids to study the functional expression of the alkBAC operon and the regulatory locus alkR in Pseudomonas putida and in Escherichia coli. Growth on alkanes requires a functional chromosomally encoded fatty acid degradation system in addition to the plasmid-borne alk system. While such a system is active in P. putida, it is active in E. coli only in fadR mutants in which fatty acid degradation enzymes are expressed constitutively. Using such mutants, we found that E. coli as well as P. putida grew on octane as the sole source of carbon and energy when they were supplied with the cloned complete alk system. The alkR locus was strictly necessary in E. coli as well as in P. putida for expression of the alkBAC operon. The alkBAC operon could, however, be further reduced to a 5-kilobase pair operon without affecting the Alk phenotype in either species to a significant extent. Although with this reduction the plasmid-encoded alkanol dehydrogenase activity was lost, chromosomally encoded alkanol dehydrogenases in P. putida and E. coli compensated for this loss. The induction kinetics of the alk system was studied in detail in P. putida and E. coli. We used specific antibodies raised against alkane hydroxylase to follow the appearance of this protein following induction with octane. We found the induction kinetics of alkane hydroxylase to be similar in both species. A steady-state level was reached after about 2 h of induction in which time the alkane hydroxylase accounted for about 1.5% of total newly synthesized protein. Thus, alkBAC expression is very efficient and strictly regulated to both P. putida and E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1524260356,"To investigate the mechanism by which glucocorticoids inhibit glucose transport in peripheral tissues, we have used a monoclonal antibody directed against the human glucose transporter to measure the relative amounts of glucose transporter polypeptide in various cell fractions of human foreskin fibroblasts after treatment with and without dexamethasone. In cells treated for 4 h with 100 nM dexamethasone, a decrease of 48% in glucose transport was accompanied by a decrease of 40% in the amount of glucose transporter polypeptide in a plasma membrane fraction enriched 10-fold in 5′-nucleotidase activity and a 78% increase in the amount of transporter polypeptide in a fraction of putative intracellular membranes, designated P2. There was no significant change in the amount of transporter polypeptide in whole cell lysates. Insulin (200 nM) stimulated glucose transport in basal fibroblasts by only 9%. However, addition of insulin for 30 min to cells that had been treated for 4 h with dexamethasone completely reversed the dexamethasone-induced decrease in glucose transport and also reversed the dexamethasone-induced changes in glucose transporter polypeptide content of the plasma membrane and P2 fractions. From these observations we conclude that dexamethasone decreases glucose transport by causing translocation of glucose transporters from the plasma membrane to an internal location and that insulin reverses the dexamethasone effect by reversing the translocation."
https://openalex.org/W185984331,"Purified lac permease, the 46.5-kDa product of the lac Y gene that catalyzes lactose/H+ symport, or purified cytochrome o, a terminal oxidase of the Escherichia coli respiratory chain composed of four subunits with a composite molecular mass of 140 kDa, was reconstituted into proteoliposomes individually or in combination. The preparations were then examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy employing conventional platinum/carbon replicas or by means of a new technique using thin tantalum replicas. In nonenergized proteoliposomes, both proteins appear to reconstitute as monomers based on (i) the variation of intramembrane particle density with protein concentration; (ii) the ratio of particles corresponding to each protein in proteoliposomes reconstituted with a known ratio of permease to oxidase; and (iii) the dimensions of the particles observed in tantalum replicas. The intramembrane particle diameters in tantalum replicas are about 20-25% smaller than those observed in conventional platinum/carbon replicas, indicating that the dimensions of the particles revealed with tantalum more accurately reflect the sizes of lac permease and cytochrome o. The diameters and heights of the permease and cytochrome o in tantalum replicas are 5.1 nm × 2.8 nm and 7.4 nm × 4.2 nm, respectively. Furthermore, a higher percentage of lac permease molecules exhibits a notch or cleft in tantalum replicas relative to platinum/carbon replicas. Importantly, the initial rate of lactose/H+ symport in proteoliposomes varies linearly with the ratio of lac permease to phospholipid, and no change is observed in either the size or distribution of lac permease molecules when the proteoliposomes are energized. The results taken as a whole provide a strong indication that both lac permease and cytochrome o reconstitute into proteoliposomes as monomers, that the permease does not dimerize in the presence of the H+ electrochemical gradient, and that both molecules are completely functional as monomers."
https://openalex.org/W1525120405,"Phosphoribulokinase is light-regulated via thioredoxin by reversible oxidation/reduction of sulfhydryl/disulfide groups. To identify the cysteinyl residues that are involved in regulation, the S-carboxymethyl labeling patterns of the fully reduced (active) and oxidized (inactive) forms of the enzyme were compared. Tryptic digests of the reduced, [14C]carboxymethylated enzyme contained four labeled peptides, all of which were purified and sequenced by Edman degradation. If the enzyme was oxidized by 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) prior to carboxymethylation and tryptic digestion, only two labeled peptides were observed, thereby revealing the identity of the regulatory cysteines as Cys-16 and Cys-55. The former was previously implicated as part of the nucleotide-binding domain of the active site (Porter, M.A., and Hartman, F.C. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 7314-7318), a conclusion reinforced by the present observation that the sequence around the Cys-16 is similar to a consensus sequence of ATP-binding sites from a number of proteins of diverse phylogenetic origin (Higgins, C.F., Hiles, I.D., Salmond, G.P.C., Gill, D.R., Downie, J.A., Evans, I.J., Holland, I.B., Gray, L., Buckel, S.D., Bell, A.W., and Hermondson, M. (1986) Nature 323, 448-450). The regulatory disulfide of phosphoribulokinase was found to be intrasubunit based on the stoichiometry of the oxidation and the failure to resolve oxidized and reduced enzyme by gel filtration under dissociation conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1971099031,"N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) activates a class of excitatory amino acid receptor involved in a variety of plastic and pathological processes in the brain. Quantitative study of the NMDA receptor has been difficult in mammalian neurons, because it usually exists with other excitatory amino acid receptors of overlapping pharmacological specificities. Xenopus oocytes injected with messenger RNA isolated from primary cultures of rat brain have now been used to study NMDA receptors. The distinguishing properties of neuronal NMDA receptors have been reproduced in this amphibian cell, including voltage-dependent block by magnesium, block by the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, and potentiation by glycine. This preparation should facilitate the quantitative study of the regulation of NMDA receptor activation and serve as a tool for purification of the encoding messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1925761535,"The cellular specificity of the Escherichia coli-derived verotoxin is of particular interest because of its extreme toxicity and high selectivity toward certain primate cells. The human Burkitt lymphoma cell line (Daudi) is highly susceptible to the cytotoxicity of verotoxin and contains large amounts of the verotoxin-binding glycolipids on its surface. A mutant selected from Daudi cells for verotoxin resistance was found to be deficient in the verotoxin-binding glycolipids, globotriosylceramide and galabiosylceramide, and failed to bind verotoxin to its surface; interestingly, these mutant cells were found to be cross-resistant to inhibition of growth by alpha-interferon. Mutant cells also lack the high affinity component of alpha-interferon binding. These observations suggest that, in addition to providing the functional cell-surface receptor for verotoxin, these glycolipids may also play a role in the modulation of the affinity of alpha-interferon for its membrane protein receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1534655255,"Abstract Two soluble forms of inositol phosphate 5-phosphomonoesterase have been partially purified and characterized from rat brain and are referred to as type 1 and type 2 according to their order of elution from DEAE-Sepharose. Together, these enzymes represent 26 +/- 3% (mean +/- S.E., n = 4) of the total inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) phosphatase activity assayed in crude brain homogenate and are present in approximately equal total activities in a 100,000 x g supernatant, with the remainder being membrane-bound. Both soluble enzymes require Mg2+ for activity, are moderately inhibited by Ca2+ in the micromolar range, and can be inhibited by millimolar concentrations of a variety of phosphorylated compounds. The type 1 enzyme has been purified to a specific activity of 1.06 mumol/min/mg protein. It elutes as a 60-kDa protein on Sephacryl S-200. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the type 1 enzyme correlates with a pair of protein bands of 66 and 60 kDa. It has apparent Km values of 3 and 0.8 microM for Ins(1,4,5)P3 and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), respectively, and hydrolyses Ins(1,4,5)P3 approximately 12 times faster than Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The type 2 enzyme has been purified to a specific activity of 15.2 mumol/min/mg protein, elutes as a protein of 160 kDa on Sephacryl S-300, and migrates as a similarly sized subunit on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It has an apparent Km for Ins(1,4,5)P3 of 18 microM. Its apparent Km for Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, however, is greater than 150 microM, suggesting that this enzyme is primarily an Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphomonoesterase. The relationship of these two enzymes to the inositol tris/tetrakisphosphate pathway is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1636039759,"Abstract N-Acetylneuraminic acid cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.43) (CMP-NeuAc synthetase) catalyzes the formation of cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid. We have purified CMP-NeuAc synthetase from an Escherichia coli O18:K1 cytoplasmic fraction to apparent homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on CDP-ethanolamine linked to agarose. The enzyme has a specific activity of 2.1 mumol/mg/min and migrates as a single protein and activity band on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme has a requirement for Mg2+ or Mn2+ and exhibits optimal activity between pH 9.0 and 10. The apparent Michaelis constants for the CTP and NeuAc are 0.31 and 4 mM, respectively. The CTP analogues 5-mercuri-CTP and CTP-2',3'-dialdehyde are inhibitors. The purified CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase has a molecular weight of approximately 50,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gene encoding CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase is located on a 3.3-kilobase HindIII fragment. The purified enzyme appears to be identical to the 50,000 Mr polypeptide encoded by this gene based on insertion mutations that result in the loss of detectable enzymatic activity. The amino-terminal sequence of the purified protein was used to locate the start codon for the CMP-NeuAc synthetase gene. Both the enzyme and the 50,000 Mr polypeptide have the same NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. Antibodies prepared to a peptide derived from the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence bind to purified CMP-NeuAc synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1544507600,"Stimulation of human platelets by thrombin leads to rises of both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4)P3) within 10 s. The mass of Ins(1,4,5)P3 was measured in platelet extracts after conversion to [3-32P]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 with Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP. Basal levels were equivalent to 0.2 microM and rose to 1 microM within 10 s of stimulation by thrombin. The mass of Ins(1,3,4)P3 was more than 10-fold greater than that of Ins(1,4,5)P3 between 10 and 60 s of thrombin stimulation. These results indicate that the majority of InsP3 liberated by phospholipase C in stimulated platelets must be the non-cyclic Ins(1,4,5)P3 in order to allow rapid phosphorylation by Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and then dephosphorylation to Ins(1,3,4)P3 by 5-phosphomonoesterase. A significant proportion of the InsP3 extracted from thrombin-stimulated platelets under neutral conditions is resistant to Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase but susceptible after acid treatment, implying the presence of inositol 1,2-cyclic 4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,2cyc4,5)P3. The relative proportion of Ins(1,2cyc4,5)P3 increases with time. We suggest that such gradual accumulation is attributable to the relative insensitivity of this compound to hydrolytic and phosphorylating enzymes. Therefore, early Ca2+ mobilization in platelets is more likely to be effected by Ins(1,4,5)P3 than by Ins(1,2cyc4,5)P3."
https://openalex.org/W1806577530,"The glpK gene, which codes for Escherichia coli K-12 glycerol kinase (EC 2.1.7.30, ATP:glycerol 3-phosphotransferase), has been cloned into the HindIII site of pBR322. The gene was contained in a 2.8-kilobase DNA fragment which was obtained from a lambda transducing bacteriophage, lambda dglpK100 (Conrad, C.A., Stearns, G.W., III, Prater, W.E., Rheiner, J.A., and Johnson, J.R. (1984) Mol. Gen. Genet. 195, 376-378). The DNA sequence of 2 kilobases of the cloned HindIII fragment was obtained using the dideoxynucleotide method. The start of the open reading frame for the glpK gene was identified from the N-terminal sequence of the first 22 amino acid residues of the purified enzyme, which was determined by automated Edman degradation. The open reading frame codes for a protein of 502 amino acids and a molecular weight of 56,106 which is in good agreement with the value previously determined by sedimentation equilibrium. The primary structure of the protein as deduced from the gene sequence was corroborated by the isolation and sequencing of four tryptic peptides, which were found to occur at the following amino acid locations: 173-177, 203-211, 279-281, 464-468. The N-terminal sequence of the purified enzyme shows that the enzyme undergoes post-translational processing. Restriction digestion as well as DNA sequencing of the supercoiled plasmid shows that the HindIII fragment is inserted into pBR322 such that the glpK gene is transcribed in a counterclockwise direction. Examination of the upstream DNA sequence reveals two possible promoters of essentially the same efficiency: the P1 promoter of pBR322 and a hybrid promoter which contains both bacterial and pBR322 DNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2028648766,"Ligand-induced decrease in cell-surface receptor number (homologous downregulation) is often due to rapid receptor internalization. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), however, causes a slow downregulation of TRH receptors (TRH-Rs), with a half-time of approximately 12 hours, in GH3 rat pituitary cells. The mechanism of TRH-R downregulation was studied by monitoring TRH-evoked depolarizing currents in Xenopus oocytes injected with GH3 cell RNA as a bioassay for TRH-R messenger RNA (mRNA) activity. In GH3 cells, TRH caused a rapid decrease in TRH-R mRNA activity to 15 percent of control within 3 hours. Because the half-life of TRH-R mRNA activity in control cells was approximately 3 hours, the rapid decrease in mRNA activity was not due to inhibition of mRNA synthesis alone and may represent a post-transcriptional effect."
https://openalex.org/W2019497853,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide with broad tissue distribution. Although its precise function is unknown, it is thought to exert its effect, at least in part, by interacting with cell surface receptors. Nuclear receptors for VIP have now been identified by specific binding of 125I-labeled VIP to nuclei of a human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line (HT29) and by cross-linking of 125I-labeled VIP to its receptor on intact nuclei. In contrast, 125I-labeled transferrin shows only background binding to nuclei but significant binding to intact cells. Purity of the isolated nuclei was further substantiated by electron microscopy. The apparent molecular sizes of the VIP—cross-linked nuclear and cell surface receptors are similar but not identical."
https://openalex.org/W1560196011,"An endo-exonuclease has been purified from logarithmically growing cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Identification and purification of this nuclease was facilitated by its being precipitable with an antibody raised against a previously described Neurospora crassa endo-exonuclease (Resnick, M. A., Chow, T. Y.-K. Nitiss, J., and Game, J. C. (1984) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 49, 639-649 and T. Y.-K. Chow and M. A. Resnick (1988) Mol. Gen. Genet., in press). The enzyme which was purified to near homogeneity was composed of a molecular weight 72,000 monomer. The single-strand nuclease activity is endonucleolytic and nonprocessive, whereas the double-strand DNase activity is exonucleolytic and weakly processive. Both nuclease activities have a pH optimum of 7.5, require Mg2+ or Mn2+ but not Zn2+ or Ca2+, are not inhibited by ATP, and exhibit the same kinetics of heat inactivation. Although this protein is not the product of the RAD52 gene, the greatly reduced amounts in rad52 mutants implicate the enzyme in repair and recombination processes in both mitotic and meiotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1518910188,"The neurotensin receptor protein, solubilized with digitonin/asolectin from bovine cerebral cortex membranes, was purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography using immobilized neurotensin. The product exhibits saturable and specific binding of [3,11-tyrosyl-3,5-3H]neurotensin with an apparent affinity (Kd = 5.5 nM) comparable to that measured in intact membranes and crude soluble extracts. The affinity-purified material, after reduction with 100 mM dithiothreitol, in denaturing gel electrophoresis showed a single polypeptide of Mr 72,000. Under nonreducing conditions the apparent Mr, however, was 50,000, suggesting the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds. The purified neurotensin receptor was judged to be homogeneous, in that (i) only a single polypeptide was detectable; and (ii) the overall purification was 30,000-50,000-fold, giving a specific neurotensin-binding activity close to the theoretical maximum."
https://openalex.org/W1523987344,"Abstract The ability of rat hepatocytes to degrade internalized surface-bound 125I-asialoorosomucoid (ASOR) was determined by measuring the appearance of acid-soluble radioactivity at 37 degrees C. The degradation kinetics were biphasic in cells previously equilibrated at 37 degrees C for 1 h or cultured for 24 h. Degradation began immediately and was linear for at least 20 min after which the rate increased to a steady state value 3-4 times greater than the initial rate. We previously showed that hepatocytes have two functionally distinct populations of galactosyl receptors that mediate ligand dissociation by two kinetically different pathways (Weigel, P. H., Clarke, B. L., and Oka, J. A. (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 140, 43-50). The activity of one receptor population, designated State 2 galactosyl receptors, can be reversibly modulated by incubating cells between 22 and 37 degrees C and is not expressed on the surface of freshly isolated cells. When 125I-ASOR was prebound to freshly isolated cells at 4 degrees C and degradation was assessed subsequently at 37 degrees C, the kinetics were monophasic, not biphasic. Degradation of the surface-bound 125I-ASOR began immediately and was greater than 90% complete by 6 h. Freshly isolated cells were incubated at temperatures between 22 and 37 degrees C, chilled to 4 degrees C, allowed to pre-bind 125I-ASOR, and then incubated at 37 degrees C. As the State 2 galactosyl receptor population increased, the kinetics of degradation became progressively more biphasic and the rate of the delayed degradation process increased. This effect could be reversed in cells in culture or in suspension by down-modulating surface receptor activity at temperatures below 37 degrees C; only the degradation process appearing after a 20-min lag was affected. Degradation in both pathways is an apparent first order process with identical rate constants (kappa = 0.006 min-1, t1/2 = 116 min). We conclude that there are two separate pathways by which asialoglycoproteins are degraded. The major classic pathway mediated by State 2 galactosyl receptors occurs after a 20-min lag and the minor pathway mediated by State 1 galactosyl receptors begins immediately with no detectable lag."
https://openalex.org/W1772054195,"Dietary carbohydrates are known to stimulate L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression at the transcriptional level in the liver. However, the short-term effects, the time course, and the mechanism of the gene activation by elemental hexoses in normal fasted rats remain unknown. In the present study, both glucose and fructose were found to stimulate the gene expression at the transcriptional level in liver. However, the kinetics and the extent of the mRNA induction differed according to the carbohydrate given. Fructose stimulated early (2-4 h) and transiently the gene transcription, the RNA precursor, and the mRNA accumulation in 48-h-fasted rats while maximum stimulation of the RNA synthesis by glucose was delayed until the 12th h of refeeding, despite an early rise of plasma insulin. In contrast, insulin release was not required for fructose to trigger the gene transcription, nor did the high cyclic AMP levels in fasted rat liver prevent RNA synthesis by fructose. The agent(s) operating early in fructose-fed animals might be powerful enough to not require insulin for gene activation and to balance the inhibitory action of glucagon in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1514758818,"alpha 2-Adrenergic receptors, a population of receptors linked to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, accelerate Na+/H+ exchange in NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma cells (Isom, L. L., Cragoe, E. J., Jr., and Limbird, L. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6750-6757). We now report that two other receptor populations linked to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, muscarinic cholinergic and delta-opiate receptors, also alkalinize the interior of NG108-15 cells, as measured with the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe, 2,7-biscarboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxy-fluorescein. Manipulations that block Na+/H+ exchange, i.e. removal of extracellular Na+, reduction of extracellular pH to equal that of intracellular pH, and addition of 5-amino-substituted analogs of amiloride, all block alpha 2-adrenergic, delta-opiate, or muscarinic cholinergic receptor-induced alkalinization in a parallel fashion. These data suggest that all three populations of receptors alkalinize NG108-15 cells by acceleration of Na+/H+ exchange and do so via a shared or similar mechanism. Although these three receptor populations are linked to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, decreased production of cAMP does not appear to be the mechanism responsible for receptor-accelerated Na+/H+ exchange. Thus, ADP-ribosylation of intact NG108-15 cells with Bordetella pertussis islet-activating protein prevents attenuation of prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP accumulation by alpha 2-adrenergic, muscarinic, and delta-opiate agonists but has no measurable effect on the ability of these agonists to accelerate Na+/H+ exchange. Similarly, manipulations that block receptor-accelerated Na+/H+ exchange influence but do not block receptor-mediated attenuation of cAMP accumulation. Thus, the present data suggest that these two receptor-mediated biochemical events, acceleration of Na+/H+ exchange and attenuation of cAMP accumulation, occur through divergent mechanisms in NG108-15 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1515186507,"The spectra of radicals formed upon the addition of .OH radicals to the 3 position of substrates for p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 4-aminobenzoic acid) have been determined using pulse radiolysis combined with the results from high performance liquid chromatography measurements. The 3-hydroxy radical forms of the substrates absorb maximally in the 365-410 nm region with extinction coefficients in the range 3700-5250 M-1 cm-1. Upon combining these radical spectra with the known spectrum of enzyme-bound reduced flavin that is substituted in the C(4a) position of the isoalloxazine ring, spectra are found which closely resemble the species long thought to be formed concomitantly with the introduction of an oxygen atom into substrates. On the basis of these spectral results a new radical mechanism is proposed for the functioning of this class of flavoprotein hydroxylases."
https://openalex.org/W1488912811,"Abstract Differentiated neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells NG 108-15 express on their surface specific binding sites for tetanus toxin. 450 sites/cell with a KD of 2 x 10(-11) M were found under conditions of pH and salt concentrations. A Hill coefficient of 1.1 indicated noncooperative binding. Specific binding of 125I-toxin to its sites could be prevented either by preincubation of the toxin with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody or by pretreatment of the cells with neuraminidase (Vibrio cholerae). To quantify the action of tetanus toxin on the stimulated release of 14C activity from differentiated cells preincubated with [14C]choline, a new type of perfusion device was designed which could be filled with cells growing in monolayers on Cytodex-3 microbeads. Tetanus toxin inhibited the stimulated 14C release in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A greater than 50% inhibition was found after 2 h of incubation with 10(-12) M toxin. The inhibitory action of tetanus toxin could be prevented with a monoclonal antibody to the toxin or with neuraminidase treatment of the cells. These results suggest that the neuraminidase-sensitive 2 x 10(-11) KD receptors are the productive receptors for tetanus intoxication in differentiated NG 108-15 cells. The possible chemical composition of these receptors is discussed. Differentiated NG 108-15 cells provide a useful model in which picomolar tetanus concentrations produce both measurable saturable binding and inhibition of potassium-evoked, acetylcholine release under physiological conditions of pH and salt concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1525630683,"The fate of cell surface gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors on pituitary cells was studied utilizing lysosomotropic agents and monensin. Labeling of pituitary cells with a photoreactive GnRH derivative, [azidobenzoyl-D-Lys6]GnRH, revealed a specific band of Mr = 60,000. When photoaffinity-labeled cells were exposed to trypsin immediately after completion of the binding, the radioactivity incorporated into the Mr = 60,000 band decreased, with a concomitant appearance of a proteolytic fragment (Mr = 45,000). This fragment reflects cell surface receptors. Following GnRH binding, the hormone-receptor complexes underwent internalization, partial degradation, and recycling. The process of hormone-receptor complex degradation was substantially prevented by lysosomotropic agents, such as chloroquine and methylamine, or the proton ionophore, monensin. Chloroquine and monensin, however, did not affect receptor recycling, since the tryptic fragment of Mr = 45,000 was evident after treatment with these agents. This suggests that recycling of GnRH receptors in gonadotropes occurs whether or not the internal environment is acidic. Based on these findings, we propose a model describing the intracellular pathway of GnRH receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1599997845,"Abstract An expression vector (pSJyub-5) was constructed which contained five repeats of the yeast ubiquitin regulated by a heat-inducible lambda PL promoter. The vector, when expressed in Escherichia coli, produced a penta-ubiquitin of approximately 42 kDa. Purified penta-ubiquitin was found to be as active as the human mono-ubiquitin in the in vitro ATP/ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic assay of the reticulocyte lysate, indicating that the expressed gene product was recognized by the enzymes involved in the ATP/ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. The inability of penta-ubiquitin to act as a substrate in the pyrophosphate exchange reaction with the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 suggested that it had a carboxyl-terminal Asn, in agreement with the nucleotide sequence. In E. coli, the expressed penta-ubiquitin was processed correctly to mono-ubiquitin. The fidelity of processing in E. coli was confirmed by the following observations. The amino acid compositions of the processed mono-ubiquitin and human ubiquitin were similar. The 1H NMR spectrum of peaks representing amide hydrogens of the carboxyl-terminal Arg-74, Gly-75, and Gly-76 of the processed mono-ubiquitin was identical with that of human ubiquitin. The immunoreactivity of processed mono-ubiquitin and human ubiquitin against polyclonal antibodies that recognized epitope(s) only on the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin were similar. The human and processed mono-ubiquitin were equally active in degrading 125I-bovine serum albumin in the ATP/ubiquitin-dependent in vitro proteolytic assay with reticulocyte lysates. In the pyrophosphate exchange assay with isolated ubiquitin activating enzyme E1, they were also equally reactive, confirming that the expressed and processed ubiquitin contained an intact carboxyl-terminal Gly-76. Purified penta-ubiquitin should prove to be a useful substrate for identifying and isolating processing enzyme(s) involved in the ATP/ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1591574481,"The effects of arachidonic acid (20:4) on phosphoinositide turnover were examined in rat pancreatic acinar cells prelabeled with myo-[3H]inositol. Arachidonic acid (50 microM) increased the accumulation of myo-[3H]inositol, but not that of [3H]inositol monophosphate, [3H]inositol bisphosphate, or [3H]inositol trisphosphate. By contrast, 10 microM carbamoylcholine increased the accumulation of all four compounds. A combination of arachidonic acid plus carbamoylcholine caused a selective and marked accumulation of myo-[3H]inositol, which was abolished by 10 mM LiCl. Arachidonic acid (10-100 microM) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of myo-[3H]inositol incorporation into phosphoinositides and markedly depressed carbamoylcholine-induced increases in myo-[3H]inositol incorporation into inositol phospholipids. Several other unsaturated and saturated fatty acids failed to elicit a synergistic response with carbamoylcholine in stimulating myo-[3H]inositol accumulation and did not retard the incorporation of myo-[3H]inositol into phosphoinositides. The fact that eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5), but not arachidic acid (20:0), mimicked the depressant effect of arachidonate on phosphoinositide labeling suggests that the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acid, rather than chain length, is important for inhibition of phosphoinositide synthesis. The arachidonate-induced decrease in myo-[3H]inositol incorporation was accompanied by a reduction in the steady state level of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The mass of arachidonic acid liberated in response to carbamoylcholine was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the time course of stimulated arachidonate accumulation paralleled that of inositol phosphate accumulation and amylase release. These observations suggest that in exocrine pancreas, endogenous arachidonic acid serves as a negative feedback regulator of phosphoinositide turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1837440465,"The 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor from porcine intestine has been characterized by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies to the receptor that recognize two different epitopes on the receptor protein quantitatively precipitate the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 binding activity from nuclear and whole cell extracts of intestinal mucosa. These antibodies were then used to study the porcine receptor by both one- and two-dimensional immunoblotting techniques. One-dimensional immunoblots of nuclear extract and whole cell extract show the receptor to be a single polypeptide of Mr approximately 55,000. The migration of the receptor on one-dimensional gels was unchanged by preassociation in vitro with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In two-dimensional immunoblots two receptor proteins were detected, both of molecular weight 55,000. In addition, a form of the receptor did not enter the isoelectric focusing gel from either the acidic or basic direction. It did, however, migrate in the Mr 55,000 region in the molecular separation. The major receptor protein has a pI of 6.1; the minor protein has a pI of 5.9. These studies represent the first determinations of the size and charge of a mammalian 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor in crude tissue preparations, and they indicate that the pig receptor is a Mr 55,000 protein that exhibits charge heterogeneity in vivo. The nature of this apparent charge heterogeneity and its significance in receptor function are under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1480177624,"Ligand-induced modulation of the hepatic receptor for asialoglycoproteins has been examined in the human hepatoblastoma cell line, Hep G2. When grown to confluence, approximately 80% of the functional receptors are expressed at the cell surface. In contrast, exposure of these cells to saturating levels of galactose- or N-acetylgalactosamine-terminated ligands, for extended periods of time, resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of cell surface receptors, as determined by the binding of 125I-asialo-orosomucoid at 4 degrees C. Recovery of binding capacity was slow and incomplete despite retention of cellular viability and normal growth characteristics. Under these conditions, the decreased number of surface receptors could not be accounted for by changes in binding affinity or by internalization since the intracellular receptor number remained essentially constant. No corresponding decrease was noted in the ability of insulin or transferrin to bind to their respective cell surface receptors in the modulated cells. Similarly, Northern blot analysis revealed no changes in the steady state levels of the asialoglycoprotein receptor transcripts. However, antibody prepared against the purified human receptor bound equally well to both control and modulated cells, thereby indicating the presence of a proportionate number of inactive surface receptors on the latter cells. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis failed to detect any abnormality in the molecular weight or isoelectric point of the modulated receptor. These findings are interpreted as indicating that the Hep G2 cells are able to regulate the functional expression of this surface receptor without altering its immunologic integrity. A defect in cell surface sialylation appears to be involved in the regulatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1517432413,"The effects of islet-activating protein (pertussis toxin) on bradykinin-mediated inositol trisphosphate labeling, prostaglandin E2 production, and calcium mobilization in rabbit renal papillary collecting tubule cells were assessed. Islet-activating protein induced time and concentration-dependent decreases in bradykinin-stimulated prostaglandin E2 production. Islet-activating protein induced increases in basal cyclic AMP levels but not in arginine vasopressin-stimulated cAMP. This effect could be inhibited by prior incubation with 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase. Although cAMP and cAMP analogues were able to inhibit both basal and bradykinin-stimulated prostaglandin E2 formation, the inhibitory effects of islet-activating protein on prostaglandin E2 formation and inositol trisphosphate labeling were observed in the presence of dideoxyadenosine. Moreover, islet-activating protein lowered both the basal and kinin-stimulated cytosolic calcium concentration as assessed by Quin 2 fluorescence. Finally, incubation of a membrane fraction of papillary cells with islet-activating protein resulted in the ADP-ribosylation of a 39/41-kDa doublet. These data support the role of a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein in bradykinin-mediated signal transduction in rabbit papillary collecting tubule cells."
