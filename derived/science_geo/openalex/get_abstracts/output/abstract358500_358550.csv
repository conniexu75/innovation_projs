https://openalex.org/W2023091234,"ANTAGONISTIC activity to other fungi by Trichothecium roseum Link (syn. Cephalothecium roseum Corda) has been reported by Whetzel1, Boning2, Koch3 and Greaney and Machacek4. Culture filtrates of T. roseum have been shown to inhibit germination of Botrytis allii conidia5. We have isolated the substance responsible for this activity in crystalline form in yields of 20–30 mgm. per litre of culture filtrate. The name ‘trichothecin' is suggested for the active substance."

https://openalex.org/W2087152711,"IT is known from examination in the electron microscope that turnip yellow mosaic virus1 consists, in the dry state, of individual particles of spherical form and about 22 mµ in diameter. It readily forms macroscopic crystals, usually octahedra, from aqueous salt solutions. Preliminary X-ray studies indicate that these wet crystals have a large unit cell, and Carlisle suggests2 that the lattice may be of the diamond type. Attempts have been made to obtain replicas of the dry crystals, by the method which has proved successful with some other plant viruses3,4, but these have not shown any regular structure. The failure may be due to the shape of the crystals or to difficulties of drying."

https://openalex.org/W2014109198,"IT has recently been suggested by von Hevesy1 that processes occurring at the cell surfaces or just inside cell boundaries play an important part in phosphorus metabolism in yeast. We have obtained evidence that we interpret in a similar vein, and suggest the existence of a ‘P-complexing factor' at the cell surface."

So far as we know, however, no determination of the structure of this oxide has been published; the difficulty in preparing single crystals of U3O8 may be the reason."
https://openalex.org/W1970251786,"BETWEEN February and June 1947, 20·5 per cent of the males, 3·7 per cent of the females and 0·3 per cent of the copepodids of Pseudocalanus elongatus Boeck, collected from six stations between Flamborough Head and the Dogger Bank, were found to be parasitized by Blastodinium contortum hyalinum Chatton. Almost all the observed parasites were found to be in the tetrablastic or a later stage, with a length of 440—560µ. They occurred singly in the vast majority of cases, but very rarely two individuals were found in the same Pseudocalanus. As the material was unstained, it is likely that most of the earlier stages of the parasite were overlooked, particularly in the younger stages of the copepodids, and that the proportion of infected individuals was really higher than that given."
https://openalex.org/W1984494903,"IN a series of papers by Dougherty, White and Chase, it has been claimed that the rate of lymphoid tissue dissolution is under the control of the adrenal cortex1–5, and that injections of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone or adrenal cortical extract accelerate this dissolution and release antibody globulin which, it has been claimed by themselves6,2,7,4,5and by other workers8,9 is present in the lymphocytes. The evidence adduced by Dougherty, White and Chase in support of this contention was the histological finding of cellular destruction and increased phagocytic activity in the lymphoid organs, and the reduction of weight of these organs, which they10 and others11–14 had shown to follow such injections. The present work was undertaken to investigate by quantitative methods the action of adrenal cortical extracts on lymphocytes, and to determine whether any direct lytic effect could be demonstrated."

https://openalex.org/W2058483700,"CHLOROCRUORIN, the green-red respiratory blood pigment of certain marine annelid worms, is the only known substance built on the same plan as haemoglobin. Like most kinds of haemoglobin, chlorocruorin has a higher affinity for carbon monoxide than for oxygen1. This property, valueless to animals, is utilized in experimental work to eliminate the possible respiratory activity of these pigments and so to test their functional significance2,3. The relative affinity of chlorocruorin (Ch), or of haemoglobin, for the two gases in the reversible reaction is given by the equilibrium constant K in the equation , from which it is seen that when the pigment is 50 per cent in the carboxy state and 50 per cent in the oxy state, K becomes the ratio of oxygen to carbon monoxide."
https://openalex.org/W1997855341,"IT was reported earlier1 that a strain of Fusarium lateritium produced an antibiotic, lateritiin-I, which was representative of a group of related compounds in presenting several remarkable chemical features. These features were elaborated in a communication to the Eleventh International Congress of Pure and Applied Chemistry held in London in July 1947, in which it was stated that lateritiin-I gave rise on hydrolysis to D(—)-α-hydroxyisovaleric acid and L(+)-N-methylvaline (II). The different configurations of these products were an indication, taking their configurational stabilities into account, that these units had an individual existence in the original antibiotic. This conclusion was supported by the isolation from lateritiin-I, after mild alkaline hydrolysis, of a lactone from which a crystalline methyl ester was prepared, the properties of these compounds being compatible with the structures (III) and (IV) respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2063499873,"IT is generally accepted that the low-angle X-ray diffraction pattern of collagen is unidimensional in the direction of the fibre axis with a fundamental period of 640 A. 1. Variations in the water content of the fibre, effected by a control of the ambient relative humidity during the X-ray exposure, alter this spacing from 628 A. at 2 per cent relative humidity to 672 A. at 100 per cent relative humidity. This continuous increase in spacing is accompanied by drastic fluctuations in the relative intensities of the various orders."

https://openalex.org/W2002300943,"THE device described here has proved very useful for the rapid measurement of RF values on paper partition chromatograms1. In the figure, AB is an aluminium strip 20 in. × ½ in. × in., AC is a piece of white elastic 9 in. × ½ in. attached to the end A of the strip by sewing through a hole in the strip. The other end of the elastic C is attached to a small ‘bulldog' clip. A scale (divided into 100 parts) is marked on the elastic. For use, the zero of the scale is placed at the origin line or spot and the 100 mark stretched out to coincide with the position reached by the solvent front. The RF values of the spots can then be read off directly on the scale. While α-amino-acids can be recognized simply from their relative positions on a chromatogram, the device allows a quick check on isolated or unknown spots or the spread of a spot. A smaller apparatus on the same expanding-scale principle can be used for measuring the R value2 of substances on a column where the ratio, movement of band/movement of sample of liquid in unpacked part of the column above, is employed."

In view of the interest in these compounds which has been stimulated by the observations of Lehmann1, Vallentin2 and of Dempsey and Logg3 of the beneficial effects of 4-aminosalicylic acid (P.A.S.) on patients with various tuberculous lesions, a preliminary statement of some of our results seems opportune."
https://openalex.org/W2069472885,"IT appears from the literature on Phytophthora infestans that many workers have had difficulty in growing this fungus and in obtaining a supply of sporangia. The fungus grows and fructifies well on potato leaves and tuber slices, but such cultures require frequent renewal. Recently Snieszko et al.1 in the United States described various media which supported growth, particularly a cereal grains – peanut hull mixture upon which the fungus spored freely. Peanut hulls are not readily available in Great Britain."

https://openalex.org/W4254834748,"ATTEMPTS to prepare new analgesics have, for many years, been based almost exclusively on the morphine molecule, the peripheral groups of which may be modified considerably with relatively little effect on the biological activity. The synthetic drug ‘Pethidine' (ethyl 4-phenyl-1-methylpiperidine-4-carboxylate) has several structural features in common with morphine, and there is a considerable body of evidence which relates analgesics of the piperidine type to the morphine model1–4. The recently discovered ‘Amidone' (dl-2-dimethylamino-4 : 4-di-phenylheptan-5-one) is also a potent analgesic. We have examined three types of compound for analgesic, antispasmodic and local anæsthetic action. Although none of these compounds is closely related to morphine, several have an analgesic potency equivalent to or approaching that of ‘Pethidine'."

Although this method is adequate for the production of guanosine and adenosine, we have been unsuccessful in isolating the pyrimidine nucleosides in the pure state and in good yield by this method, and believe this to be due to the method of isolation adopted by Bredereck."
https://openalex.org/W1967349418,"COWAN1 in 1945 demonstrated that aqueous solutions of penicillin could lose up to 60 per cent of their antibiotic activity by simple passage through the rubber tube of a continuous-drip apparatus. These results were confirmed by Huelsbusch, Foter and Gibby2, who showed that certain samples of both natural and synthetic rubber could inactivate completely the penicillin in solution in twenty-four hours ; and also by Hughes3, who showed that no improvement was obtained by repeated washing of the tubes before use."
https://openalex.org/W1969144246,"IF pressure, sufficient to be thoroughly uncomfortable, is maintained by the fingers on the eyeball, numerous violet dots will eventually appear in among the other entoptical phenomena. Each dot lasts a second or so. If the pressure is suddenly released, all the entoptical phenomena disappear except the violet dots, which are left for a few seconds against a dark background. They are fairly uniformly distributed over the field of view, and may number anything up to, say, 100. From the fact that all the violet dots are of exactly the same hue, saturation and intensity and of approximately the same size, one is probably justified in assuming that they are the fundamental violet sensation. By looking at a spectrum with the other eye (light-adapted) it is possible to match their hue against a spectral hue. They match 440·5 mµ, the standard deviation of each observation being ± 5 mµ and that of the mean being ± 0·5 mµ. They are considerably more saturated in colour than spectral violet. Their apparent angular diameters are of the order of 10'. From the tritanopic isocolour chart given by Pitt1, which depends on a description by König of five pathological cases of tritanopia, one can deduce that the fundamental violet sensation is equivalent to the sensation produced by 435 mµ, except that it is more saturated. Considering the inadequacy of the data available to Pitt, the discrepancy between 440·5 mµ and 435 mµ is not significant."

A visit to the Exhibition reminds one how very primitive were the means of artificial illumination only two centuries ago, while less than one hundred years ago the oil lamp was still the common form of lighting. We are all of us aware of the progress and achievements made during the past century. But how many realize that since only 1921 the efficiency of the ordinary 60-watt electric lamp has increased by 55 per cent while the cost has decreased by 75 per cent."
