https://openalex.org/W2013670958,"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is associated with fibrofatty replacement of cardiac myocytes, ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In 32 of 120 unrelated individuals with ARVC, we identified heterozygous mutations in PKP2, which encodes plakophilin-2, an essential armadillo-repeat protein of the cardiac desmosome. In two kindreds with ARVC, disease was incompletely penetrant in most carriers of PKP2 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2073745454,"Cilia have diverse roles in motility and sensory reception and their dysfunction contributes to cilia-related diseases. Assembly and maintenance of cilia depends on the intraflagellar transport (IFT) of axoneme, membrane, matrix and signalling proteins to appropriate destinations within the organelle1,2,3,4. In the current model, these diverse cargo proteins bind to multiple sites on macromolecular IFT particles, which are moved by a single anterograde IFT motor, kinesin-II, from the ciliary base to its distal tip5,6, where cargo-unloading occurs1,2,3,4,7. Here, we describe the observation of fluorescent IFT motors and IFT particles moving along distinct domains within sensory cilia of wild-type and IFT-motor-mutant Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that two anterograde IFT motor holoenzymes, kinesin-II and Osm-3–kinesin8, cooperate in a surprising way to control two pathways of IFT that build distinct parts of cilia. Instead of each motor independently moving its own specific cargo to a distinct destination, the two motors function redundantly to transport IFT particles along doublet microtubules adjacent to the transition zone to form the axoneme middle segment9. Next, Osm-3–kinesin alone transports IFT particles along the distal singlet microtubules to stabilize the distal segment. Thus, the subtle coordinate activity of these IFT motors creates two sequential transport pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2111074132,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin have been shown to suppress transcription factor NF-κB, which controls the expression of genes such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and cyclin D1, leading to inhibition of proliferation of tumor cells. There is no systematic study as to how these drugs differ in their ability to suppress NF-κB activation and NF-κB-regulated gene expression or cell proliferation. In the present study, we investigated the effect of almost a dozen different commonly used NSAIDs on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced NF-κB activation and NF-κB-regulated gene products, and on cell proliferation. Dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory steroid, was included for comparison with NSAIDs. As indicated by DNA binding, none of the drugs alone activated NF-κB. All compounds inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB activation, but with highly variable efficacy. The 50% inhibitory concentration required was 5.67, 3.49, 3.03, 1.25, 0.94, 0.60, 0.38, 0.084, 0.043, 0.027, 0.024, and 0.010 mM for aspirin, ibuprofen, sulindac, phenylbutazone, naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, resveratrol, curcumin, dexamethasone, celecoxib, and tamoxifen, respectively. All drugs inhibited IκBα kinase and suppressed IκBα degradation and NF-κB-regulated reporter gene expression. They also suppressed NF-κB-regulated COX-2 and cyclin D1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. All compounds inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 6.09, 1.12, 0.65, 0.49, 1.01, 0.19, 0.36, 0.012, 0.016, 0.047, 0.013, and 0.008 mM for aspirin, ibuprofen, sulindac, phenylbutazone, naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, resveratrol, curcumin, dexamethasone, celecoxib, and tamoxifen, respectively. Overall these results indicate that aspirin and ibuprofen are least potent, while resveratrol, curcumin, celecoxib, and tamoxifen are the most potent anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative agents of those we studied."
https://openalex.org/W2033853755,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins constitute a class of negative regulators for Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathways. These intracellular proteins are induced by cytokine signaling, but they can also be induced by stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLR). It has even been suggested that SOCS proteins are important negative regulators of TLR signaling. Here we have elucidated the nature of the regulatory role of SOCS in TLR signaling. Induction of SOCS-3 and cytokine-inducible Src homology 2-containing protein (CIS) by TLR stimulation was strictly dependent on MyD88 but showed differing needs in case of SOCS-1. However, induction of SOCS proteins by TLR ligands was independent of type I interferon. In macrophages overexpressing SOCS, we were not able to observe an inhibitory effect of SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, or CIS on prototypical TLR target genes such as tumor necrosis factor-α. However, we found that TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-4, and TLR-9 stimulation induced interferon-β (IFN-β), which is able to exert auto- and paracrine signaling, leading to the activation of secondary genes like IP-10. SOCS-1 and, to a lesser extent, SOCS-3 and CIS were able to inhibit this indirect signaling pathway following TLR stimulation, whereas neither MAP kinase nor NFκB signaling were affected. However, STAT-1 tyrosine phosphorylation following TLR triggering was severely impaired by SOCS-1 overexpression. Thus, our data suggest that SOCS proteins induced by TLR stimulation limit the extent of TLR signaling by inhibiting type I IFN signaling but not the main NFκB pathway.

Eight members, SOCS-1 to SOCS-7 and CIS, have been identified in this protein family (1Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 22: 503-529Crossref Scopus (602) Google Scholar). In general, SOCS are induced upon cytokine receptor activation through STAT-dependent elements in the respective promoters (2Auernhammer C.J. Bousquet C. Melmed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6964-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In turn, SOCS proteins are able to limit further receptor signaling. To that end, members of the SOCS family use different mechanisms. SOCS-1 binds to JAKs, and by means of its SH2 domain and a proximal kinase inhibitory region, it is able to directly inhibit kinase activity. SOCS-3 is recruited by phosphotyrosine residues of the intracellular domain of the cytokine receptor and also inhibits JAK activity, while CIS is thought to compete for STAT recruitment. Besides the importance of the central SH2 domain for the activity of SOCS, these proteins contain yet another domain at the C terminus, which has been termed SOCS box (3Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The SOCS box mediates interactions with elongins B and C, which are part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (4Kamura T. Sato S Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.G.J. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that SOCS can promote ubiquitinylation and proteosomal degradation of JAK2, thereby enhancing its inhibitory effects (5Frantsve J. Schwaller J. Sternberg D.W. Kutok J.

Although, in vitro, SOCS proteins can be induced by a wide variety of different cytokines, in vivo studies with knock-out models have suggested that members of the SOCS family have specific actions. For example, SOCS-1-deficient mice have severely impaired IFN-γ signaling and succumb to perinatal death with a multi-inflammatory syndrome (7Starr R. Metcalf D. Elefanty A.G. Brysha M. Willson T.A.

Backcrossing to Rag or IFN-γ knock-out mice rescues mice from early death (9Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Owczarek C.M.

Thus, SOCS-1 has been deduced to play primarily a role in IFN-γ-dominated adaptive immune responses. It has been shown that SOCS-1, SOCS-3, and CIS can also be induced in innate immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. Triggering of TLRs and stimulation with TNF-α induce SOCS proteins in these cells (10Stoiber D. Kovarik P. Cohney S. Johnston J.A. Steinlein P. Decker T. J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the case of SOCS-1 the mode of induction has been a matter of controversy as to the role of paracrine type I IFN signaling (11Dalpke A.H. Opper S. Zimmermann S. Heeg K. J.

SOCS-1 regulates the sensitivity of macrophages to IFN-γ (11Dalpke A.H. Opper S. Zimmermann S. Heeg K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7082-7089Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 15Crespo A. Filla M. Murphy W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 710-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas SOCS-3 has been implicated to dampen IL-6 sensitivity (16Lang R. Pauleau A.L. Parganas E.

Immunol. 2003; 4: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Besides this mode of action, which has to be referred to as crosstalk inhibition, further reports suggested that SOCS proteins may have a broader inhibitory role which involves JAK/STAT-independent signaling pathways, namely, TNF-α, insulin, and vav (19Morita Y. Naka T. Kawazoe Y. Fujimoto M. Narazaki M. Nakagawa R. Fukuyama H. Nagata S. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20Kawazoe Y.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This led to the suggestion that SOCS proteins could also act as direct inhibitors of TLR signaling, thus, revealing a further role in innate immunity. Toll-like receptors mediate recognition of conserved microbial structures, so called pathogen-associated molecular patterns. TLRs have been identified to be crucial receptors for the recognition of microbial encounter in innate immunity and mutations in TLRs result in impaired defense against infections (22Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6618) Google Scholar). Upon TLR stimulation, at least some of the receptors dimerize. In turn, adaptor molecules are recruited to the receptor complex via the TIR domain that is shared with the interleukin-1 receptor. Subsequently, further signaling molecules among which are IRAKs and TRAF-6 are recruited and activate MAP kinase signaling, as well as NFκB. MyD88 was the first adaptor molecule to be identified, and MyD88-deficient mice show a loss of proinflammatory cytokine induction upon TLR stimulation (23Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). However, some signaling events are independent of MyD88, and further adaptors have been identified. Thus, a complicated picture has emerged in which two main signaling streams can be observed (24Hertzog P.J. O'Neill L.A. Hamilton J.A. Trends. Immunol. 2003; 24: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). First, there are direct target genes, which are induced via MAP kinases and NFκB, including the prototypical proinflammtory cytokine TNF-α. Some of these genes, however, are induced upon intermediate activation of IκBζ, as shown recently (25Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). This pathway is dependent on MyD88; however, in the case of TLR-2 and TLR-4, an additional adaptor Mal/TIRAP can be used (26Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 27Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Second, at least some TLRs activate IRF-3, resulting in IFN-β induction (24Hertzog P.J. O'Neill L.A. Hamilton J.A. Trends. Immunol. 2003; 24: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In turn, IFN-β becomes secreted and can act in an autocrine and paracrine manner to activate JAK/STAT signaling. This broadens the set of induced genes. IP-10 and iNOS are thought to be activated in this way, and also the upregulation of CD40 has been shown to be IFN-β-dependent (28Hoebe K. Janssen E.M. Kim S.O. Alexopoulou L. Flavell R.A. Han J. Beutler B. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 29Hattori Y. Akimoto K. Matsumura M. Tseng C.C. Kasai K. Shimoda S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 40: 889-896PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of TLR-3 and TLR-4, two further adaptors, TRIF/TICAM-1 and TRAM/TICAM-2, are used (30Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 31Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S.

Immunol. 2003; 4: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). This pathway has been neglected for TLR-2 stimulation (34Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). There is indirect evidence linking SOCS to TLR signaling, since it has been reported that SOCS-1-deficient mice exhibit increased LPS sensitivity, associated with elevated TNF-α secretion, and lack endotoxin tolerance (35Kinjyo I. Hanada T. Inagaki-Ohara K. Mori H. Aki D. Ohishi M. Yoshida H. Kubo M. Yoshimura A. Immunity. 2002; 17: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 36Nakagawa R. Naka T. Tsutsui H. Fujimoto M. Kimura A. Abe T. Seki E. Sato S. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. Yamanishi K. Kawase I. Nakanishi K. Kishimoto T. Immunity. 2002; 17: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). These effects could be observed in macrophages and were also retained in SOCS-1/IFN-γ double knock-out mice, thus, ruling out the possibility of a pre-activation of macrophages by increased IFN-γ sensitivity. Direct effects of SOCS-1 on NFκB signaling have been proposed on the basis of transfection experiments. However, the precise mechanism and role of SOCS-1 for TLR signaling are still elusive. Here we analyzed the MyD88 and paracrine type I IFN dependence of SOCS-1, SOCS-3, and CIS induction following TLR stimulation. Moreover, we made use of an overexpression system of SOCS in macrophages with careful control of expression levels. We were not able to observe inhibitory effects of SOCS on TLR-induced TNF-α and nitrite secretion. However, we found that all TLR ligands induced IFN-β and subsequent IFN-β-triggered STAT-1-dependent signaling. This secondary signaling pathway, as exemplified by IP-10 induction, was sensitive to inhibition by SOCS-1 and to a lesser extent by SOCS-3 and CIS. These data clearly show that the effects of SOCS-1 on TLR signal transduction are limited to the inhibition of secondary type I IFN-dependent amplification circuits. Reagents—Completely phosphorothioate-modified CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) 1668 (TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ATG CT) was purchased from TIB Molbiol (Berlin). Lipoteichoic acid from Staphylococcus aureus was a kind gift from S. Morath (Konstanz, Germany) and was shown to be TLR-2-dependent (37Lehner M.D. Morath S. Michelsen K.S. Schumann R.R. Hartung T. J.

Poly(dI-dC) was purchased from Sigma (Schnelldorf, Germany). Pam3CSK4 was obtained from EMC Microcollections (Tübingen, Germany). Antibodies specific for phosphorylated MAP kinases, phosphorylated STAT-1, IκBα, and c-Myc were from Cell Signaling Technology (Frankfurt, Germany). Anti-FLAG M2 antibody was obtained from Sigma. Recombinant IFN-γ and GM-CSF were purchased from Tebu (Frankfurt, Germany). Mice—MyD88-deficient mice were obtained from A. Gessner, Erlangen, Germany. IFNAR-I-deficient mice were delivered from B&K Universal. Further mice were purchased from Harlan-Winkelmann, Borchen, Germany. Cells and Culture Conditions—Cells were cultured in Clicks/RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5-10% FCS, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics (penicillin G and streptomycin). Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were isolated from Balb/c mice as described previously (38Inaba K. Inaba M. Romani N. Aya H. Deguchi M. Ikehara S. Muramatsu S. Steinman R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar), albeit with slight modifications. Briefly, bone marrow cells (4 × 106) were seeded into an 80-cm2 tissue culture flask, containing culture medium and 20 ng/ml GM-CSF. Non-adherent cells were used at day 9 when immature dendritic cells (CD11c+, GR-1-) represented >85% of the resulting cell population. Peritoneal macrophages were obtained by thioglycollate injection and adherence purification. RAW 264.7 cells were a kind gift from R. Schumann (Berlin, Germany). Generation of Stable RAW 264.7 Transfectants—Mammalian expression vectors for SOCS-1, -2, and -3 were obtained from D. Hilton (Victoria, Australia). pEF-Sem, which contains a neomycin resistance cassette, was a kind gift from H. Haecker (Munich, Germany). Stable transfections were established by cotransfection of either SOCS or empty vector expression plasmids and pEF-Sem in a ratio of 10 to 1. RAW 264.7 cells (5 × 106) were transfected by electroporation in 500 μl final volume at 290 V, 1050 μF in an EasyjecT plus gene pulser (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany). Cells were plated, and multiple G418-resistant clones were picked, expanded, and tested both for expression of SOCS mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR, as well as for expression of SOCS protein by Western blot with anti-FLAG or anti-c-Myc antibodies. Determination of Cytokine and Nitric Oxide Secretion—1.5 × 105 cells were stimulated in 96-well plates in 300 μl of medium as indicated in duplicates. Supernatants were harvested and analyzed for cytokines by commercially available ELISA kits (TNF-α and IL12p40 (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) and IP-10 (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany). Nitric oxide accumulation was measured photometrically (550 nm) by mixing equal parts of supernatant and Griess reagent (1:1 mixture of 1% sulfanilamide, 5% H3PO4, and 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride). Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA from 1 × 106 cells was isolated using a HighPure™ RNA kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) which included DNase I digestion. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed with a cDNA synthesis kit (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). cDNA, diluted 1:4, was used as template in the quantitative PCR mix according to the manufacturer's standard protocol (Eurogentec, Seraign, Belgium) (ABI Prism 7700, Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences have been previously published (11Dalpke A.H. Opper S. Zimmermann S. Heeg K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7082-7089Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and are available on request. Quantifications were made using either fluorogenic probes (6-carboxyfluorescein/6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) or by means of SYBR Green. Specificity of RT-PCR was controlled by no template and no RT controls. PCR efficiencies for all reactions were determined and were similar (0.94-1.0). Threshold values were normalized to expression of β-actin. Quantitative PCR results are expressed relative to the induction of the housekeeping gene β-actin (1/2ΔCt). Western Blot—2-5 × 106 cells were stimulated and subsequently lysed for 30 min on ice in 250 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Igepal, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 11,000 × g. Equal amounts of lysates were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were stained with the indicated antibodies, and proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Where indicated, membranes were stripped and re-probed. Reporter Gene Experiments—For reporter gene experiments, the NFκB-dependent ELAM promoter (obtained from H. Heine, Borstel, Germany), as well as the STAT-1-dependent IFP-53 promoter (from T. Decker, Vienna, Austria), were used coupled to a luciferase reporter gene. Transient transfections in RAW 264.7 cells were performed with 0.8 μg of reporter gene and 2.0 μg of SOCS expression plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Luciferase induction was measured with a LucLit kit (Packard) in a TopCountNXT. NFκB Activation—Nuclear translocation of activated NFκB was measured using the TransAM™ kit (Activemotif, Rixensart, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's protocol after stimulation of cells for 45 min with 100 ng/ml LPS. Flow Cytometry—Cells were washed in PBS, 2% FCS. Fc block was done with anti-FcγRII/III monoclonal antibodies (clone 2.4G2, Pharmingen) and 10% normal mouse serum. Cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD40 (clone HM40-3, Pharmingen) or phycoerythrin (PE)-CD86 (clone GL1, Pharmingen). For the analysis of phosphorylated STAT-1, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were further fixed and permeabilized in 90% methanol at -20 °C overnight. Cells were incubated with 1 μl of phosphotyrosine-specific STAT-1 antibody (clone 4a, Pharmingen) in 100 μl of volume together with Fc block for 2 h at room temperature. Finally cells were stained with PE-labeled secondary antibody (Dako, Hamburg, Germany). Cells were analyzed on a Partec PAS flow cytometer (Dako). TLR-mediated SOCS Induction Differs with Regard to MyD88 Dependence—TLR activation induces various SOCS proteins; however, the precise mechanisms are still a matter of controversy. We first used MyD88-deficient mice to further gain insight into TLR-mediated SOCS induction (Fig. 1a). MyD88 has been shown to be used as an adaptor by most of the TLRs. Stimulation of peritoneal macrophages with prototypic ligands for different TLRs revealed that induction of SOCS-3 and CIS was completely dependent upon MyD88 in response to all TLR ligands tested. Moreover, peritoneal macrophages showed similar induction of SOCS-3 in response to the different ligands, whereas CIS induction was mainly achieved by LPS and LTA. Interestingly, SOCS-1 induction completely depended on MyD88 in the case of CpG-DNA and LTA stimulation, but induction was mostly preserved in MyD88-deficient mice stimulated with LPS or poly(dI-dC). Thus, a given TLR-dependent gene can be induced by disparate pathways which use distinct adaptor proteins. TLR Triggering Induces SOCS in a Direct and Type I IFN-independent Manner—Next we analyzed a possible role of paracrine acting type I IFN in TLR-mediated induction of SOCS, in particular, SOCS-1. Therefore, we used a transwell system with LPS-responsive C3H/HeN macrophages and LPS non-responsive C3H/HeJ cells in the respective chambers (Fig. 1b). Upon stimulation with LPS, induction of mRNA for the direct target gene TNF-α was only observed in the C3H/HeN macrophages. In contrast, IP-10, which is induced indirectly via secreted type I IFN, showed increased expression in both macrophage populations. SOCS-1 behaved like TNF-α, thus, ruling out a significant contribution of paracrine mediators. CpG-DNA as control showed induction of the different genes in all cells. In addition, we stimulated type I IFN receptor-deficient mice (Fig. 1c). All TLR stimuli induced SOCS-1, SOCS-3, and CIS in dendritic cells. SOCS-3 and CIS induction showed no differences in IFNAR-I-/- mice as was the case for TNF-α. SOCS-1 induction was not affected in the case of the control stimulus IFN-γ, yet showed a slight, but not significant, decrease in response to LPS and CpG-DNA. In addition, no major role for type I IFN in TLR-mediated SOCS induction could be identified in dendritic cells. TLR-1, -2, -3, -4, and -9 Ligands Induce Secondary Type I IFN-dependent Signaling—To further study the significance of SOCS for TLR signaling, we first assessed whether the concept of direct and indirect, type I IFN-dependent TLR signaling (see Fig. 7) holds true for different TLR ligands, a matter that is controversial in the literature. First, we examined induction of transcripts for IFN-β as well as IFN-β-dependent IP-10 in comparison with the direct target gene TNF-α (Fig. 2a). In general, all of the tested TLR ligands (which have been shown to be devoid of contaminants earlier) were able to induce IFN-β and IP-10. The concentrations of the respective stimuli were chosen to give nearly equal TNF-α induction. However, poly(dI-dC) was more efficient in IFN-β induction, and LPS, as well as poly(dI-dC), also induced more IP-10 transcription (in the range of 15-fold more than with CpG-DNA). The results were confirmed by Western blot with phosphotyrosine-specific STAT-1 detection (Fig. 2b). Upon prolonged TLR stimulation, STAT-1 activation could be observed with LPS, CpG-DNA, or LTA in C57Bl/6 macrophages. Again, LPS was more efficient than LTA or CpG-DNA. Results were corroborated with C3H/HeN mice; however, in this case CpG-DNA was much more active, arguing for strain-specific differences in type I IFN signaling. C3H/HeJ mice confirmed that indeed STAT-1 activation by lipoteichoic acid was not due to LPS contaminants. Moreover, STAT-1 activation differed with respect to MyD88 dependence, whereas CpG-DNA and LTA were completely dependent on MyD88. Finally, transwell experiments confirmed that STAT-1 activation is due to the paracrine action of a secreted factor, most probably type I IFNs (Fig. 2c).Fig. 2Activation of indirect type I IFN signaling in response to TLR stimulation. Peritoneal macrophages from C57Bl/6 mice were stimulated with 300 nm CpG-DNA, 100 ng/ml LPS, 5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 10 μg/ml LTA, or 10 μg/ml Pam3CSK4 for 6 h. a, expression of mRNA for IFN-β, IP-10, and TNF-α was determined relative to β-actin (n = 3, mean ± S.D.). b, lysates were prepared and equal amounts were blotted with phosphospecific STAT-1 Ab. c, peritoneal macrophages were placed in a transwell system (0.4 μm) and stimulated and analyzed as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Generation of Macrophages with Stable Overexpression of SOCS—To evaluate a possible role of SOCS in TLR signal transduction we elected to use an overexpression system.

https://openalex.org/W2011792786,"Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are an integral component of the signal transduction apparatus employed by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. As such, their role in cellular growth control and malignant transformation has been the subject of intensive investigation. In contrast, classical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling involves activation of second messenger-regulated serine/threonine kinases or ion channels, and is primarily involved in neurotransmission and the short-term regulation of intermediary metabolism. Over the past decade, this strictly dichotomous model of transmembrane signaling has been challenged by the discovery that GPCRs also exert control over cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation, and do so by stimulating tyrosine phosphorylation cascades. Several mechanisms, from the direct association of Src family kinases with GPCRs or receptor-associated proteins, to the transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases and focal adhesion complexes by G-protein-mediated signals, permit GPCRs to activate Src family kinases. Conversely, Src activity plays a central role in controlling GPCR trafficking and effects on cell proliferation and cytoskeletal rearrangement. It is now clear that GPCRs and Src family kinases do not belong to separate, exclusive clubs. Rather, these strange bedfellows are intimately involved in multilayered forms of crosstalk that influence a host of cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W2039058963,"Regulation of cell-cell communication by the gap junction protein connexin43 can be modulated by a variety of connexin-associating proteins. In particular, c-Src can disrupt the connexin43 (Cx43)-zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) interaction, leading to down-regulation of gap junction intercellular communication. The binding sites for ZO-1 and c-Src correspond to widely separated Cx43 domains (∼100 residues apart); however, little is known about the structural modifications that may allow information to be transferred over this distance. Here, we have characterized the structure of the connexin43 carboxyl-terminal domain (Cx43CT) to assess its ability to interact with domains from ZO-1 and c-Src. NMR data indicate that the Cx43CT exists primarily as an elongated random coil, with two regions of α-helical structure. NMR titration experiments determined that the ZO-1 PDZ-2 domain affected the last 19 Cx43CT residues, a region larger than that reported to be required for Cx43CT-ZO-1 binding. The c-Src SH3 domain affected Cx43CT residues Lys-264–Lys-287, Ser-306–Glu-316, His-331–Phe-337, Leu-356–Val-359, and Ala-367–Ser-372. Only region Lys-264–Lys-287 contains the residues previously reported to act as an SH3 binding domain. The specificity of these interactions was verified by peptide competition experiments. Finally, we demonstrated that the SH3 domain could partially displace the Cx43CT-PDZ-2 complex. These studies represent the first structural characterization of a connexin domain when integrated in a multimolecular complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the structural characteristics of a disordered Cx43CT are advantageous for signaling between different binding partners that may be important in describing the mechanism of channel closure or internalization in response to pathophysiological stimuli.

The overall structure of the Cx43CT was mainly random coiled; however, two regions of helical structure were present (Fig. 1, A and B). These helical regions were superimposed on the basis of backbone coordinates from Ala-315–Thr-326 and Asp-340–Ala-348 (Fig. 1C). The total root mean square deviations for these alignments were 0.27 and 0.34 Å, respectively. Structural statistics are presented in Table I. The predominately random coil structure for the Cx43CT is consistent with the narrow chemical shift dispersions in the 15N HSQC (Fig. 1D).Table IStructural statistics of the 10 lowest energy Cx43CT structuresNOE distance restraints (total 1177)Intra-residue401Sequential471Medium304Long range1Backbone hydrogen bonds9r.m.s.d.ar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation of atomic coordinates (residues 315–326, 340–348)Backbone (Å)0.41, 0.38All non-hydrogens (Å)1.59, 1.41Ramachandran plotResidues in most favored regions41.0%Residues in additional allowed regions43.1%r.m.s.d.ar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation from ideal geometryBond lengths (Å)0.004Bond angles (deg)bdeg, degrees0.568Impropers (deg)bdeg, degrees0.23a r.m.s.d., root mean square deviationb deg, degrees Open table in a new tab Structural Changes in Cx43CT Resulting from Binding of Cellular Partners—The solution of the structure of Cx43CT allowed for an assessment of the modifications that result from its interaction with other molecules. We focused our attention on two well known binding partners of Cx43 for which we have recently quantified binding affinities to Cx43CT in solution (28Duffy H.S. Ashton A.W. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar): the second PDZ domain of ZO-1 (PDZ-2) and the SH3 domain of c-Src (SH3). Unlabeled PDZ-2 or SH3 fragments were diluted in a phosphate-buffered saline buffer solution (pH 5.8) containing 15N-Cx43CT to a final 1:1 molar ratio, and 15N-HSQC spectra were acquired. The 15N-HSQC is a two-dimensional NMR experiment in which each amino acid (except proline) gives one signal (or chemical shift) that corresponds to the N–H amide group. These chemical shifts are sensitive to the chemical environment, and even small changes in structure and/or dynamics can change the chemical shift of an amino acid.The addition of the PDZ-2 domain affected the resonance peaks of the last 19 amino acids of the Cx43CT, a region larger than what was expected from the putative “PDZ binding domain” of Cx43 (the final 4 amino acids in the carboxyl terminus (42Toyofuku T. Akamatsu Y. Zhang H. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Hori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1780-1788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)). Indeed, as seen in Fig. 2A, the signal from residues Ser-372–Ile-382 completely disappeared (i.e. broadened beyond detection), whereas the amplitude of the peaks corresponding to residues Ser-364–Ala-371 decreased in intensity. These changes can be explained by decreased tumbling rates caused by an increase in molecular weight and/or intermediate chemical exchange rates, both indicative of a structural modification caused by the association of the two molecules.Fig. 215N-HSQCs of the Cx43CT in the presence of the PDZ-2 domain of ZO-1. This experiment allowed for detection of the regions of Cx43CT that were structurally modified when in the presence of a binding domain from the molecular partner ZO-1. A, Cx43CT was titrated with the PDZ-2 domain of ZO-1 to a 1:1 molar ratio. The control spectra, Cx43CT only (black), have been overlapped with spectra obtained when both molecules were present at a 1:1 molar ratio (red). The amino acid peaks that disappeared have been labeled. B, the Cx43CT-PDZ-2 complex (red) was titrated with a peptide corresponding to residues 363–382 to a final molar concentration of 1:3 (black). The differences in appearance between panels A and B are due to the collection of data on different spectrometers (600 versus 300 MHz), number of scans collected (16 versus 4), and complex points in the 15N dimension (256 versus 64), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify the specificity of this interaction, resonance peaks were resolved in the presence of excess peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 20 residues of Cx43-(363–382). As indicated in Fig. 2B, the resonances for each of the residues affected in the presence of ZO-1 PDZ-2 returned to normal signal intensity in the presence of excess peptide. These data are consistent with a specific Cx43CT-PDZ-2 interaction at the carboxyl-terminal domain of Cx43.The addition of the SH3 domain affected the resonance peaks of amino acids Lys-264–Lys-287, Ser-306–Glu-316, His-331–Phe-337, Leu-356–Val-359, and Ala-367–Ser-372 (Fig. 3). Only the region Lys-264–Lys-287 contains the amino acids previously reported to act as an SH3 binding domain (43Warn-Cramer B.J. Lampe P.D. Kurata W.E. Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Eckhart W. Lau A.F. J.

Although all changes were consistent with SH3 binding and altering the structure of Cx43CT, the resonance peaks were affected in three different ways. Peaks completely disappeared for residues Lys-264–Lys-287 (Fig. 3A, blue), decreased in intensity for residues Ser-306–Glu-316 (Fig. 3A, red), and shifted for residues His-331–Phe-337, Leu-356–Val-359, and Ala-367–Ser-372 (see Supplemental Data 1). Interestingly, region 367–372 overlaps with the residues involved in binding the ZO-1 PDZ-2 domain to Cx43CT.Fig. 315N-HSQCs of the Cx43CT in the presence of the SH3 domain of c-Src. This experiment allowed for detection of the regions of Cx43CT that were structurally modified when in the presence of a binding domain from the molecular partner c-Src. A, Cx43CT was titrated with the SH3 domain of c-Src to a 1:1 molar ratio. The control spectra, Cx43CT only (black), have been overlapped with spectra obtained when both molecules were present at a 1:1 molar ratio (red). The amino acid peaks that disappeared or decreased in intensity (regions Lys-264–Lys-287 (blue) and Glu-306–Glu-316 (red)) have been labeled. B, to verify the specificity of the Cx43CT interaction with the SH3 domain of c-Src, the Cx43CT-SH3 complex (red) from panel A was titrated with a peptide corresponding to residues 271–287 to a final concentration of 1:3 (black). Selected Cx43CT residues from regions Lys-264–Lys-287 and Glu-306–Glu-316 have been labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The specificity of these interactions was verified by the use of excess peptides corresponding to the Cx43CT residues affected by the binding of the SH3 domain. The peptide competition experiments indicated that the Cx43CT-SH3 complex was inhibited by peptides 271–287, 312–336, and 346–360 (Fig. 3B and Supplemental Data 2), as indicated by the re-emergence of all resonance peaks affected in Fig. 3A. Control peptides that correspond to the amino-terminal domain (NT) and the first extracellular loop (EL) of Cx43 did not interfere with the Cx43CT-SH3 interaction (see Supplemental Data 2). The results from this experiment indicate that although binding is confined to the SH3 canonical interaction domain of Cx43CT, conformational changes resulting from this binding extend for large distances along the Cx43CT.SH3 Binding Cx43CT Disrupts the Cx43CT-PDZ-2 Complex—Previous data have indicated that c-Src can disrupt the Cx43-ZO-1 interaction, leading to down-regulation of gap junction intercellular communication (28Duffy H.S.

Spray D.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) reported a pH-dependent “cross-talk” between Cx43CT interactions in the SH3 binding domain and the PDZ binding domain. Here, we determined whether the SH3-induced structural modifications in Cx43CT affected the conformation of the region ascribed as the PDZ-2 binding domain (residues Ser-364–Ile-382; Fig. 2A). 15N-Cx43CT (Fig. 4, black) was combined with unlabeled PDZ-2 in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 5.8) to a final 1:1 molar concentration (Fig. 4, red); unlabeled SH3 was titrated into the complex (Fig. 4, green), and 15N-HSQC spectra were acquired. Clearly, the addition of SH3 led to the reappearance of those Cx43CT resonance peaks that had disappeared as a result of the Cx43CT-PDZ-2 interaction, although reappearance of the resonance peaks was not complete (black and green intensities not being equal) even after a 3-fold excess of the SH3 domain. Finally, it is worth noting that the presence of the PDZ-2 domain did not affect the changes in Cx43CT resonance peaks caused by the presence of the SH3 domain. These data, combined with our inability to detect an SH3-PDZ-2 interaction by chemical cross-linking (data not shown), is consistent with a hypothesis that Cx43-ZO-1 dissociation may occur by Cx43CT structural modifications induced by pH (e.g. dimerization) and Cx43-c-Src interactions rather than via a direct ZO-1-c-Src interaction. We propose that the Cx43CT domain has the ability to undergo disorder-to-order transitions in the presence of molecular partners to facilitate signaling between different molecules.Fig. 415N-HSQCs demonstrating the dissociation of the Cx43CT-PDZ-2 complex by the SH3 domain. The Cx43CT residues that disappeared due to the Cx43CT-PDZ-2 interaction and reappear due to the addition of the SH3 domain have been labeled. Colors correspond to 15N-HSQC spectra of Cx43CT alone (black), Cx43CT combined with unlabeled PDZ-2 (red), and the Cx43CT-PDZ-2 complex combined with unlabeled SH3 (green).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe have characterized the structure of the carboxyl-terminal domain of Cx43 by the use of NMR. Our data indicate that Cx43CT exists primarily as an elongated random coil, with two regions of α-helical structure. We have further characterized the structural modifications brought about by the interaction of Cx43CT with two well known molecular partners and determined that those modifications are flexible, so that binding to one partner can largely displace the interaction with the other. These studies represent the first structural characterization of a connexin domain when integrated in a multimolecular complex and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the chemical regulation of Cx43.Analysis of the Cx43CT Structure—Our data show that most of the Cx43CT sequence is configured as a random coil. Analysis of eukaryotic genomes led to the estimation that between 35 and 51% of all proteins contain disordered regions greater than 40 consecutive amino acids in length (46Dunker A.K. Brown C.J. Lawson J.D. Iakoucheva L.M. Obradovic Z. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6573-6582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). A protein data base analysis determined that there are four broad functional categories of disordered proteins: molecular recognition, molecular assembly, protein modifications, and entropic chains (46Dunker A.K.

https://openalex.org/W2015861720,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is an obligate negative regulator of cytokine signaling and most importantly in vivo, signaling via the interferon-γ (IFN-γ) receptor. SOCS1, via its Src homology 2 domain, binds to phosphotyrosine residues in its targets, reducing the amplitude of signaling from cytokine receptors. SOCS1 is also implicated in blocking Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in macrophages activated by TLR agonists such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thus regulating multiple steps in the activation of innate immune responses. To rigorously test this, we isolated macrophages from Socs1-/- mice on multiple genetic backgrounds. We found no evidence that SOCS1 blocked TLR-activated pathways, endotoxin tolerance, or nitric oxide production. However, Socs1-/-;IFN-γ-/- mice were extremely susceptible to LPS challenge, confirming previous findings. Because LPS induces IFN-β production from macrophages, we tested whether SOCS1 regulates IFN-α/β receptor signaling. We find that SOCS1 is required to inhibit IFN-α/β receptor signaling in vitro. Furthermore, the absence of a single allele encoding TYK2, a JAK (Janus kinase) family member essential IFN-α/β receptor signaling, rescued Socs1-/- mice from early lethality, even in the presence of IFN-γ. We conclude that previous reports linking SOCS1 to TLR signaling are most likely due to effects on IFN-α/β receptor signaling.

SOCS1 is a member of a family of proteins that regulate cytokine signaling pathways via inhibition of key tyrosine phosphorylation events on cytokine receptors and signaling molecules such as JAK family members (1Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of SOCS proteins are mediated by two domains found in all SOCS family members: an SH2 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology 2; SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; IFN, interferon; IL-12, interleukin-12; BMDM, bone marrow-derived macrophage; TLR, Toll-like receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JAK, Janus kinase. domain that can bind phosphorylated tyrosine residues and the SOCS box that functions as a ubiquitin E3 ligase and thus potentially directs substrate proteins to the protein degradation machinery (1Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical events associated with SOCS function are poorly understood, overwhelming genetic evidence has demonstrated multiple members of the SOCS family are essential for the regulation of specific cytokine signal transduction events in vivo. Mice lacking SOCS1 die 10–20 days after birth (2Marine J.C. Topham D.J. McKay C. Wang D. Parganas E. Stravopodis D. Yoshimura A. Ihle J.N.

Dissection of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the death of the Socs1-/- mice has revealed that SOCS1 is essential for the response of cells to IFN-γ and IFN-γ production (2Marine J.C.

In the absence of SOCS1, IFN-γ levels rise, as does the responsiveness of cells bearing IFN-γ receptors (e.g. macrophages), causing an overwhelming inflammatory response that has been analyzed in great detail (1Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The key pathway involved in this complex pathologic process is the IFN-γ-mediated phosphorylation and activation of STAT1, the central signal transduction molecule required for IFN-γ signaling (3Alexander W.S.

SOCS1 itself is a target of IFN-γ-induced gene expression and thereby can function to block IFN-γ signaling via a negative feedback loop (1Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev.

Analysis of Socs1-/- mice intercrossed with mice bearing mutations in cytokine signaling pathways has additionally revealed that SOCS1 can regulate signaling from receptors other than the IFN-γR including those using the γc chain and the IL-12 receptor (6Chong M.M.

This stands in contrast to the inhibitory effects of SOCS2 and SOCS3 that function to block a more limited number of cytokine signaling events (1Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). A surprising set of results was recently published showing SOCS1 also regulates Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (11Nakagawa R. Naka T. Tsutsui H. Fujimoto M. Kimura A. Abe T. Seki E. Sato S.

TLRs are a group of 10–11 surface transmembrane proteins that contribute to the sensing of conserved microbial structures, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), detected by TLR4 or flagellin that signals through TLR5 (13Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). TLRs function in higher order signaling complexes that lead, in part, to the rapid activation of NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling and the subsequent production of cytokines and chemokines by cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (13Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). The activation of TLR signaling is an essential and conserved mechanism to activate the innate immune system. The authors of the aforementioned papers established that the absence of SOCS1 caused increased lethality when mice were exposed to LPS and that TLR-stimulated macrophages from Socs1-/- mice overproduced nitric oxide (NO) compared with controls (11Nakagawa R. Naka T. Tsutsui H. Fujimoto M. Kimura A. Abe T. Seki E. Sato S. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. Yamanishi K. Kawase I. Nakanishi K. Kishimoto T.

Based on these data, SOCS1 was proposed to inhibit TLR signaling although the protein(s) in the TLR signal transduction cascade targeted by SOCS1 were not identified. However, SOCS proteins are well established to target tyrosine phosphorylation events, while the TLR signaling cascades are regulated predominantly by serine/threonine phosphorylation (13Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar), making the SOCS1-mediated inhibition of TLR signaling conceptually difficult to reconcile with existing knowledge of the regulatory events that control TLR signaling. In addition, previous studies have established that SOCS1 expression is induced by TLR4 signaling but indirectly via the autocrine/paracrine effects of IFN-α/β (14Crespo A. Filla M.B. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We therefore designed experiments using Socs1-/- mice and macrophages to provide support for the notion that SOCS1 can regulate TLR signaling. The results, however, demonstrate that there is no compelling evidence for such a regulatory role for SOCS1. In contrast, we find that SOCS1 is a physiologically important regulator of IFN-α/β signaling via effects of TYK2, a JAK family member required for IFN-α/β signaling. Since TLR signaling induces IFN-α/β from macrophages challenged with LPS (14Crespo A. Filla M.B. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Biochem.

Endotoxin Challenges—Socs1-/-, Socs1+/-, or Socs1+/+ mice on an IFN-γ-/- background (ages 8–13 weeks) were individually weighed and challenged with Escherichia coli LPS (made to 5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) at 40 mg/kg by the intraperitoneal route (19Pauleau A.L. Murray P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7531-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Mice were monitored every 4–6 h over a 96-h period and survival recorded at each time point. Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier statistics. Stratification based on the sex of the mice yielded equivalent results. NO Measurements—NO levels from activated macrophages were measured using the Griess assay as described (20Rutschman R. Lang R. Hesse M. Ihle J.N. Wynn T.A. Murray P.J. J.

Cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12) levels were measured in the culture supernatants by ELISA 18 h after the LPS restimulation (22Lang R. Rutschman R.L. Greaves D.R. Murray P.J. J.

TLR Signaling to Activate ERK and IκBα Phosphorylation Is Unaffected in the Absence of SOCS1—A series of unpublished preliminary studies performed in our laboratory using macrophages from Socs1-/- mice suggested SOCS1 was unlikely to regulate TLR signaling. In response to recent suggestions that the absence of SOCS1 exacerbated TLR signaling, we accordingly established assay systems to systematically test this concept. We measured TLR signaling by first testing the activation, in Socs1-/- macrophages isolated from the bone marrow of 7–9-day-old mice, of two important pathways of TLR activity: the activation of NF-κB through the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα and the activation of p42/44 ERK phosphorylation. BMDMs from Socs1-/- or Socs1+/+ macrophages were stimulated with LPS, CpG DNA, or dsRNA, agonists of TLR4, TLR9, and TLR3, respectively. When measured by immunoblotting using antibodies specific for the activated, phosphorylated forms of IκBα or ERK, the absence of SOCS1 had no significant effect on the normal kinetics or qualitative amounts on the phoshorylated forms of either proteins (Fig. 1). We next isolated BMDMs from adult Socs1-/- mice on three different backgrounds to further attempt to establish if there were any differences in TLR signaling in the absence of SOCS1. BMDMs were isolated from Socs1-/- mice on Rag2-/-, IFN-γ-/-, or Stat1-/- backgrounds and stimulated with LPS or CpG. IκBα and ERK phosphorylation was measured as described above (Fig. 2). As we found for Socs1-/- macrophages, there appeared to be insufficient evidence to support the notion that the absence of SOCS1 affected TLR signaling in terms of IκBα or ERK phosphorylation.Fig. 2SOCS1 does not affect IκBα phosphorylation and degradation or ERK phosphorylation on genetic backgrounds that rescue neonatal lethality caused by the absence of SOCS1. Bone marrow cells were isolated from Socs1+/+;Rag2-/-, Socs1-/-; Rag2-/-, Socs1+/+;IFN-γ-/-, Socs1-/-; IFN-γ-/-, Socs1+/+; Stat1-/-, or Socs1-/-;Stat1-/- mice and cultured to produce mature BMDMs. Cells were stimulated with LPS or CpG and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 2.

To test this, we isolated BMDMs from Socs1-/- mice or Socs1+/+ mice (Fig. 3a), peritoneal inflammatory macrophages (Fig. 3b) from Socs1-/-;IFN-γ-/- mice or BMDMs from Socs1+/+ or Socs1-/- on Rag2-/-, IFN-γ-/-, or Stat1-/- backgrounds (Fig. 3c) and stimulated them with different TLR agonists in the presence or absence of IFN-γ. NO levels were measured indirectly using the Griess method (Fig. 3). As predicted, NO output was highest in macrophages co-stimulated with TLR agonists and IFN-γ in each macrophage population. However, the absence of SOCS1 did not appear to significantly enhance NO production in any circumstance. SOCS1 Does Not Control the Ability of Macrophages to Become Endotoxin Tolerant—Endotoxin tolerance occurs when macrophages are exposed to LPS for hours to days and then washed and restimulated with LPS. In normal macrophages, the second stimulation is associated with a depressed ability to produce cytokines. The refractory nature of macrophages after the primary stimulation has been considered to be a significant component of host defense against systemic bacterial challenge, such as in septic shock. Previous research noted that SOCS1-deficient macrophages failed to become endotoxin tolerant (11Nakagawa R. Naka T. Tsutsui H. Fujimoto M. Kimura A. Abe T. Seki E. Sato S. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. Yamanishi K. Kawase I. Nakanishi K. Kishimoto T. Immunity. 2002; 17: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). To test this, we performed tolerance assays using well established assay systems (21Medvedev A.E. Kopydlowski K.M. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5564-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). BMDMs were stimulated with LPS for 18 h or left unstimulated, then washed and restimulated for an additional 18 h. Levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured in the supernatants by ELISA. In contrast to previous findings, we could find no evidence that the absence of SOCS1 affected the ability of macrophages to acquire tolerance to endotoxin as shown by the inhibition of IL-12 (Fig. 4) or IL-6 and TNF-α (data not shown) by pretreatment with LPS. Socs1-/-;IFN-γ-/- Mice Are Extremely Susceptible to Endotoxin Challenge—Published studies have shown that Socs1-/- mice are highly susceptible to systemic endotoxin challenge (11Nakagawa R. Naka T. Tsutsui H. Fujimoto M. Kimura A. Abe T. Seki E. Sato S. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. Yamanishi K. Kawase I. Nakanishi K. Kishimoto T.

Immunity. 2002; 17: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In addition, Socs1+/-;IFN-γ-/- mice were also more susceptible than Socs1+/+;IFN-γ-/- mice, suggesting that gene dosage of Socs1 leads to a significant effect in the response of the host to septic challenge. We performed further experiments to test these concepts. In these experiments, we used adult Socs1-/- mice on an IFN-γ-/- background to obviate the need to use mice less than 10–15 days of age, since newborn mice are more sensitive to LPS challenge than adults (19Pauleau A.L. Murray P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7531-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Groups of male and female mice were accurately weighed and injected with 40 mg/kg LPS and survival monitored over 4 days. A relatively high dose was necessary, since the absence of IFN-γ signaling enhances endotoxin resistance (23Car B.D. Eng V.M. Schnyder B. Ozmen L. Huang S. Gallay P. Heumann D. Aguet M. Ryffel B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1437-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies, we found that Socs1-/-; IFN-γ-/- mice rapidly died compared with controls (Fig. 5). However, there was no effect of Socs1 heterozygosity in contrast to claims that loss of a single allele of Socs1 on an IFN-γ-/- background increased LPS-induced lethality (11Nakagawa R. Naka T. Tsutsui H. Fujimoto M. Kimura A. Abe T. Seki E. Sato S. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. Yamanishi K. Kawase I. Nakanishi K. Kishimoto T. Immunity. 2002; 17: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In contrast to previous experiments that used limited numbers of mice (n = 4), our experiments used 40 Socs1+/-;IFN-γ-/- mice compared with 23 Socs1+/+;IFN-γ-/- mice to establish that there was no evidence for any effects of Socs1 heterozygosity on the ability to withstand systemic endotoxin challenge. SOCS1 Regulates IFN-α/β Signaling—The extreme susceptibility of Socs1-/-;IFN-γ-/- mice to endotoxin challenge suggested that SOCS1 was essential to negatively regulate a pathway(s) independent of IFN-γ that was crucial in controlling the systemic response to endotoxin. Since compelling evidence for a role of SOCS1 in directly regulating TLR signaling was lacking, we sought to substantiate a role for SOCS1 in alternative pathways relevant to innate immune responses that could contribute to endotoxin sensitivity. Upon exposure to LPS, macrophages produce high levels of IFN-α/β that act as an autocrine/paracine regulators of macrophages, NK cells, and dendritic cells, all of which contribute to the innate response to LPS (14Crespo A. Filla M.B. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). IFN-α/β production plays a crucial role in the regulation of the systemic inflammatory response to LPS because mice lacking mice lacking IFN-β, which signals through the IFN-α/βR, are significantly resistant to LPS challenge suggesting that IFN-β signaling plays a pathogenic role in sepsis (24Karaghiosoff M. Steinborn R. Kovarik P. Kriegshauser G. Baccarini M. Donabauer B. Reichart U. Kolbe T. Bogdan C. Leanderson T. Levy D. Decker T. Muller M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TYK2, a JAK family member that regulates cytokine signaling from the IFN-α/βR is also involved in endotoxin susceptibility, since Tyk2-/- mice are highly resistant to LPS challenge (24Karaghiosoff M. Steinborn R. Kovarik P. Kriegshauser G. Baccarini M. Donabauer B. Reichart U. Kolbe T. Bogdan C. Leanderson T. Levy D. Decker T. Muller M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 25Kamezaki K. Shimoda K. Numata A. Matsuda T. Nakayama K. Harada M. Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that SOCS1 may regulate IFN-α/β signaling in activated macrophages through TYK2, and this may account for the lethality observed in LPS-challenged Socs1-/-;IFN-γ-/- mice. To test this, we isolated BMDMs from Socs1-/- mice and stimulated them with IFN-β and measured STAT1 phosphorylation by immunoblotting. We found that the absence of SOCS1 causes a slight increase in STAT1 phosphorylation when macrophages are pulsed with IFN-β over time (data not shown). To confirm this finding, we next stimulated Socs1-/- macrophages with IFN-γ or IFN-β for 10 min and then washed away the cytokines. The decay in total STAT1 phosphorylation was followed over time. We found that STAT1 phosphorylation induced by IFN-β was increased in Socs1-/- cells compared with wild-type cells, confirming the notion that SOCS1 is an inhibitor of IFN-α/β signaling (Fig. 6a) in addition to its essential role in blocking IFN-γ signaling (Fig. 6b). Signaling through the IFN-α/β receptor requires that activity of both JAK1 and TYK2. Since we had obtained biochemical evidence for a role of SOCS1 in regulating IFN-α/β signaling in macrophages, we next sought genetic evidence for a role of SOCS1 in regulating IFN-α/β signaling. We crossed Socs1+/-;IFN-γ+/-;Tyk2+/- mice to generate mice lacking SOCS1, TYK2, and IFN-γ in various combinations. The breeding strategy incorporated the IFN-γ null allele to facilitate breeding for the circumstance where TYK2 loss could not rescue the lethal phenotype resulting from the SOCS1 deficiency (3Alexander W.S. Starr R. Fenner J.E. Scott C.L. Handman E. Sprigg N.S. Corbin J.E. Cornish A.L. Darwiche R. Owczarek C.M. Kay T.W. Nicola N.A. Hertzog P.J. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22086-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Two effects of loss of TYK2 on the lethality caused by SOCS1 deficiency were observed in the progeny of these mice (Table I). First, loss of a single allele of Tyk2 rescued Socs1-/- mice that were also IFN-γ+/+. These mice were weaned and still alive 40 days after birth. By comparison, Socs1-/- mice are all dead at the time of weaning, and most die by 10 days after birth. Therefore, Tyk2 heterozygosity is sufficient to overcome the early lethal effects of SOCS1 deficiency. A second effect was observed on mice that lacked SOCS1 but were IFN-γ+/-. These animals die between 30–70 days but from a pathological syndrome distinct from the Socs1-/- mice (26Metcalf D. Di Rago L. Mifsud S. Hartley L. Alexander W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9174-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We could generate Socs1-/-;IFN-γ+/-;Tyk2+/- or Socs1-/-;IFN- γ+/-;Tyk2-/- mice that were healthy and fertile. All mice born with either of these genotypes has survived, some to well over 100 days (Table I). This suggests that loss of one or two alleles of Tyk2 can also inhibit the lethal effects of IFN-γ in the Socs1-/-;IFN-γ+/- background. Taken together, these data suggest that elimination of TYK2 rescues lethality caused by the absence of SOCS1. This suggests that SOCS1 negatively regulates TYK2 signaling and therefore IFN-α/β signaling.Table IEffect of a Tyk2 loss-of-function mutation of the survival of Socs1-deficient miceGenotypeNo. mice bornNo. mice surviving to weaningNo. mice surviving to 40 daysNo. mice surviving to 100 daysSocs1-/-;IFN-γ+/-;Tyk2-/-88/86/6aThe total number of mice in each group continuing to each time point6/6aThe total number of mice in each group continuing to each time pointSocs1-/-;IFN-γ-/-;Tyk2-/-22/22/22/2Socs1-/-;IFN-γ+/-;Tyk2+/-55/55/51/1aThe total number of mice in each group continuing to each time pointSocs1-/-;IFN-γ-/-;Tyk2+/-0Socs1-/-;IFN-γ+/+;Tyk2+/-22/22/2Socs1-/-;IFN-γ+/+;Tyk2-/-44/42/2aThe total number of mice in each group continuing to each time pointa The total number of mice in each group continuing to each time point Open table in a new tab Our results suggest that SOCS1 plays no direct role in TLR signaling. We found no evidence for any effects of the absence of SOCS1 on TLR-induced signaling pathways critical for the establishment of innate immune responses. In performing these studies, we found an unanticipated role for SOCS1 in regulating IFN-α/β signaling. This pathway most likely accounts for previously observed effects of the absence of SOCS1 in systemic LPS challenges. Previous published studies (11Nakagawa R. Naka T. Tsutsui H. Fujimoto M. Kimura A. Abe T. Seki E. Sato S. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. Yamanishi K. Kawase I. Nakanishi K. Kishimoto T.

Immunity. 2002; 17: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) linking SOCS1 to the inhibition of TLR signaling could not be reproduced in our hands. We have applied genetic and biochemical approaches to show that BMDMs isolated from Socs1-/- mice or Socs1-/- mice on three different genetic backgrounds had normal TLR signaling to different TLR agonists. This result was expected, since there was no prior evidence to suggest that TLR signaling, a pathway primarily regulated by serine/threonine phosphorylation, could be inhibited by any SOCS protein, all of which bind tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates via their SH2 domains. Published data purporting a role for SOCS1 in regulating TLR signaling were in part derived from SOCS1 overexpression in macrophages (11Nakagawa R. Naka T. Tsutsui H. Fujimoto M. Kimura A. Abe T.

Numerous genetic studies have established that enforced expression of SOCS family members often leads to artifactual effects on many cytokine and other signaling pathways (1Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of SOCS1 overexpression on TLR signaling appear to fulfill a familiar pattern. SOCS1 was also claimed to regulate systemic endotoxin sensitivity (11Nakagawa R. Naka T. Tsutsui H. Fujimoto M. Kimura A. Abe T. Seki E. Sato S. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. Yamanishi K. Kawase I. Nakanishi K. Kishimoto T. Immunity. 2002; 17: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 12Kinjyo I. Hanada T. Inagaki-Ohara K. Mori H. Aki D. Ohishi M. Yoshida H. Kubo M. Yoshimura A. Immunity. 2002; 17: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). We found similar results using a rigorously defined endotoxin challenge protocol. We showed that Socs1-/-;IFN-γ-/- mice were highly sensitive to challenge. In contrast to previous data, however, we could find no evidence for any effects of Socs1 gene dosage on endotoxin sensitivity (11Nakagawa R. Naka T. Tsutsui H. Fujimoto M. Kimura A. Abe T. Seki E. Sato S. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. Yamanishi K. Kawase I. Nakanishi K. Kishimoto T. Immunity. 2002; 17: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Most likely, this stems from the low numbers of mice used by other investigators and the arbitrary administration of LPS dosage based on sex (12Kinjyo I. Hanada T. Inagaki-Ohara K. Mori H. Aki D. Ohishi M. Yoshida H. Kubo M. Yoshimura A. Immunity. 2002; 17: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In contrast, we used large numbers of mice using exact dosages based on animal weight. IFN-γR-/- mice are very resistant to endotoxin challenge suggesting an important role for IFN-γ signaling in driving the lethal inflammation in sepsis (23Car B.D. Eng V.M. Schnyder B. Ozmen L. Huang S. Gallay P. Heumann D. Aguet M. Ryffel B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1437-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We were thus surprised that Socs1-/-;IFN-γ-/- mice were highly susceptible to LPS challenge. This suggested that SOCS1 regulated IFN-γ-independent pathway(s) in the systemic inflammatory response. Mutations other than the loss of IFN-γ or its signaling components can rescue the SOCS1 deficiency, including loss of STAT6 or STAT4 (10Eyles J.L. Metcalf D. Grusby M.J. Hilton D.J. Starr R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43735-43740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Naka T. Tsutsui H. Fujimoto M. Kawazoe Y. Kohzaki H. Morita Y. Nakagawa R. Narazaki M. Adachi K. Yoshimoto T. Nakanishi K. Kishimoto T. Immunity. 2001; 14: 535-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The absence of STAT4 on a Socs1-/- background showed that SOCS1 is a significant physiological regulator of IL-12 signaling, since this STAT member is uniquely utilized by the IL-12R (10Eyles J.L. Metcalf D. Grusby M.J. Hilton D.J. Starr R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43735-43740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the IL-12R also uses TYK2 to activate the receptor and promote STAT4 phosphorylation (27Shimoda K. Kato K. Aoki K. Matsuda T. Miyamoto A. Shibamori M. Yamashita M. Numata A. Takase K. Kobayashi S. Shibata S. Asano Y. Gondo H. Sekiguchi K. Nakayama K. Nakayama T. Okamura T. Okamura S. Niho Y.

TYK2 is also used by the IFN-α/βR and, like IFN-β, plays an important role in the systemic pathogenic response to endotoxin, since Tyk2-/- or IFN-β-/- mice are highly resistant to LPS challenge (24Karaghiosoff M. Steinborn R. Kovarik P. Kriegshauser G. Baccarini M. Donabauer B. Reichart U. Kolbe T. Bogdan C. Leanderson T. Levy D. Decker T. Muller M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 25Kamezaki K. Shimoda K. Numata A. Matsuda T. Nakayama K. Harada M. Int. Immunol. 2004; 16: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we concluded that TYK2 could be a target of SOCS1, accounting the sensitivity of Socs1-/-;IFN-γ-/- mice to endotoxin. To test this, we first isolated macrophages from Socs1-/- mice and challenged them with IFN-β and measured STAT1 phosphorylation. STAT1 is activated following TYK2-mediated phosphorylation of the ligand-bound IFN-α/βR. We found that STAT1 phosphorylation is extended in this assay, providing biochemical evidence that SOCS1 plays an obligate role in IFN-α/β signaling in addition to its established role in inhibiting IFN-γ signaling. Previous overexpression studies in HeLa cells had suggested that SOCS1 was capable of inhibiting STAT1 phosphorylation from the IFN-α/βR (29Song M.M. Shuai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35056-35062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). However, using the same assay system, these authors also showed SOCS3 could inhibit both IFN-α/βR and IFN-γR signaling (29Song M.M. Shuai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35056-35062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), a phenotype of SOCS overexpression not supported by subsequent studies in Socs3-/- cells and mice (1Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Finally, we obtained genetic evidence that TYK2 is involved in SOCS1 function by showing that Socs1-/- mice can be rescued by the absence of a single allele of Tyk2 and that loss of TYK2 can rescue the lethal phenotype of Socs1-/-;IFN-γ+/- mice. At present it is not possible to exclude contributions from both IL-12 and IFN-α/β in this system, since loss of STAT4 can also partially rescue Socs1-/- mice from early lethality (10Eyles J.L. Metcalf D. Grusby M.J. Hilton D.J. Starr R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43735-43740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This study also does not address the possible long term effects of the absence of TYK2 on the ability of mice to make and respond to IFN-γ. It is possible that the extended life span of Socs1-/-;IFN-γ+/-;Tyk2+/- and Socs1-/-;IFN-γ+/-; Tyk2-/- mice reflects effects on IFN-γ homeostasis in the whole animal that enable the mice to escape the excessive inflammatory response that occurs in the absence of SOCS1, in addition to specific effects on IL-12 and IFN-α/β signaling as well as yet undiscovered cytokine receptors that could utilize TYK2. In conclusion, we find that SOCS1, an SH2-containing protein that binds phosphotryosines in its targets, does not regulate TLR signaling, a set of pathways regulated largely by serine/threonine phosphorylation. Our data suggest that SOCS1 regulates IFN-α/β signaling through effects on TYK2 and that previous studies attributing effects of SOCS1 on TLR signaling are more likely the result of priming or concurrent stimulation with IFN-α/β induced by TLR signaling. This pathway could be a significant target in the search for novel modifiers of the systemic inflammatory response and thereby be a useful target for sepsis therapeutics. We thank Dr. K. Shimoda for the gift of the Tyk2-/- mice and Dr. Alexander Dalpke for communicating results prior to publication"
https://openalex.org/W2054308102,"Rhodopsin (Rho) is a G protein-coupled receptor that initiates phototransduction in rod photoreceptors. High expression levels of Rho in the disc membranes of rod outer segments and the propensity of Rho to form higher oligomeric structures are evident from atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and chemical cross-linking experiments. To explore the structural and functional properties of Rho in n-dodecyl-β-maltoside, frequently used to purify heterologously expressed Rho and its mutants, we used gel filtration techniques, blue native gel electrophoresis, and functional assays. Here, we show that in micelles containing n-dodecyl-β-maltoside at concentrations greater than 3 mm, Rho is present as a single monomer per detergent micelle. In contrast, in 12 mm 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), micelles contain mostly dimeric Rho. The cognate G protein transducin (Gt) appears to have a preference for binding to the Rho dimer, and the complexes fall apart in the presence of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. Cross-linked Rho dimers release the chromophore at a slower rate than monomers and are much more resistant to heat denaturation. Both Rho* monomers and dimers are capable of activating Gt, and both of them are phosphorylated by Rho kinase. Rho expressed in HEK293 cells is also readily cross-linked by a bifunctional reagent. These studies provide an explanation of how detergent influences the oligomer-dimermonomer equilibrium of Rho and describe the functional characterization of Rho monomers and dimers in detergent.

In contrast, in 12 mm 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), micelles contain mostly dimeric Rho. The cognate G protein transducin (Gt) appears to have a preference for binding to the Rho dimer, and the complexes fall apart in the presence of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. Cross-linked Rho dimers release the chromophore at a slower rate than monomers and are much more resistant to heat denaturation. Both Rho* monomers and dimers are capable of activating Gt, and both of them are phosphorylated by Rho kinase. Rho expressed in HEK293 cells is also readily cross-linked by a bifunctional reagent. These studies provide an explanation of how detergent influences the oligomer-dimermonomer equilibrium of Rho and describe the functional characterization of Rho monomers and dimers in detergent.

Struct. 2003; 32: 375-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), Rho is a seven-transmembrane-spanning helical protein (6Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4992) Google Scholar). The high expression level of Rho, its specific localization in the internal discs of the structures termed rod outer segments (ROS), and the lack of other highly abundant membrane proteins allow Rho to be imaged in the native disc membranes by atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (7Medina R. Perdomo D. Bubis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39565-39573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K.

Subsequently, BN- and SDS-PAGE, chemical cross-linking, and proteolysis experiments corroborated that Rho consists mainly of dimers and higher oligomers in disc membranes. 2K. Suda, S. Filipek, K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 39565-39573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported that Rho and photoactivated Rho (Rho*) preserved a dimeric quaternary structure in detergent.These results are in conflict with a model of rapidly diffusing Rho in the “mosaic” fluid disc membrane (10Liebman P.A. Parker K.R. Dratz E.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 765-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) supported by measurements of Rho diffusion and rotation in disc membranes and by low resolution neutron diffraction studies (11Liebman P.A. Entine G. Science. 1974; 185: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 12Poo M. Cone R.A. Nature. 1974; 247: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 13Cone R.A. Nat.

The concept of rapidly diffusing monomeric molecules is at variance with the dimeric forms of other GPCRs (15Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 16Terrillon S. Bouvier M. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Moreover, the size of the G protein and arrestin surface interacting with Rho is almost twice as large as the exposed cytoplasmic surface of a single Rho molecule (17Filipek S. Krzysko K.A. Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 628-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4819-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).Nonphysiological dimers of Rho can be found in its three-dimensional crystal structures (6Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4992) Google Scholar, 19Okada T. Le Trong I.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The two subunits are related by a rotation of 180° about an axis in the plane of the membrane. This orientation would allow a larger than expected hydrophobic surface area to be engaged in interaction between Rho molecules residing in the native membranes (17Filipek S. Krzysko K.A. Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 628-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It would also place the cytoplasmic surfaces of the two subunits on opposite sides of the membrane. These dimers in the crystal appear to be induced by experimental crystallization conditions. Reconstitution of Rho into two-dimensional crystals also produces dimers where both Rho molecules are correctly oriented, but the dimers contact other dimers of Rho that are flipped in their orientation (e.g. see Refs. 22Krebs A.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).Progress on Rho topology and its signaling states was decisively advanced when Rho was cloned (25Nathans J. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1983; 34: 807-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), expressed, and purified from heterologous systems using mild detergents (26Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). This procedure opened up seminal work on identification of the counter-ion of the chromophore, the role of a number of post-translational modifications, and other structural/functional properties of Rho (reviewed in Refs. 27Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Hubbell C.M. Khorana H.G. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 63: 243-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 28Sakmar T.P. Menon S.T. Marin E.P. Awad E.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Concurrent work on other GPCRs, most notably the β-adrenergic receptor, reveals many common features among these receptors (30Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar, 31Ballesteros J.A. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 32Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Together, these experiments raise the question of whether Rho appears as a monomer, dimer, or higher oligomer in detergent. Another important aspect is whether the monomers in the dimer are unidirectionally oriented as observed in native disc membranes or whether they are bidirectionally oriented in a nonphysiological configuration as seen in the previously published crystal structures. Here, we describe the solubilization procedure of Rho that preserves receptor dimers in n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (DM) and oligomers in CHAPS. Different forms of Rho were also characterized in the functional assays.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—1,11-bis-maleimidotetraethyleneglycol (BM(PEO)4) and dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP) were purchased from Pierce, and CHAPS and DM were obtained from Anatrace Inc. (Maumee, OH). GTPγS was purchased from Roche Applied Science.Antibodies and Resins—The anti-Rho (C-terminal) monoclonal antibody 1D4 was purchased from the National Cell Culture Center (NCCC; Minneapolis, MN). The anti-Rho (N-terminal) monoclonal antibody B6-30N was a generous gift from Dr. P. Hargrave (University of Florida). The C6 monoclonal antibody that recognized a C-terminal epitope of peripherin was generated by a conventional hybridoma technique. The anti-Gt α subunit (Gtα) monoclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Heidi E. Hamm (Vanderbilt University Medical Center). The anti-Gt β subunit (Gtβ) polyclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Oleg G. Kisselev (St. Louis University School of Medicine). The hexyl-agarose resin was purchased from MP Biomedicals Inc. (Aurora, OH). Other resins and columns for chromatographies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.Cell Culture—HEK293 cells stably expressing opsin were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high concentrations of glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, zeocin (100 μg/ml), blasticidin (5 μg/ml), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). The culture was maintained at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Cells were transferred for another passage when confluent, and opsin expression was induced with tetracycline (1 μg/ml). For Rho regeneration, a Me2SO solution of 9-cis-retinal (final concentration 50 μm) was added during biosynthesis directly to the cell culture medium after 2 and 24 h of induction (33Noorwez S.M.

The cells were harvested after 48 h, washed with a mixture of 1.5 mm KH2PO4 and 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, containing 140 mm NaCl and 3 mm KCl, and stored at -80 °C. Rho was regenerated and purified as described previously (33Noorwez S.M. Kuksa V. Imanishi Y. Zhu L. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Kaushal S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14442-14450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).Chemical Cross-linking of ROS Membranes with BM(PEO)4—Bovine ROS membranes were prepared from fresh retinas under dim red light according to the procedure of Papermaster (34Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cross-linking reactions of ROS membranes with BM(PEO)4 were performed in 100 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. BM(PEO)4 was solubilized in H2O to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml (stock solution). Washed ROS membranes at Rho concentrations of 0.4 mg/ml were treated with 125-fold molar excess BM(PEO)4 and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. To remove any unreacted cross-linker, membranes were washed three times with 100 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. ROS membrane pellets were stored at -80 °C or used immediately.Chemical Cross-linking of ROS Membranes with DSP—Cross-linking reactions of ROS membranes with DSP were performed in 100 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.3, containing 150 mm NaCl. DSP was solubilized in Me2SO to a final concentration of 50 mm (stock solution). Washed ROS membranes at Rho concentrations of 0.4 mg/ml were reacted with a 125-fold molar excess of DSP on ice for 30 min. Control experiments included ROS membranes and Me2SO only. The reaction was stopped by adding from a stock solution of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 100 mm. To remove unreacted cross-linker, membranes were washed three times with 100 mm Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 8.3, containing 150 mm NaCl. ROS membrane pellets were stored at -80 °C or used immediately.Chemical Cross-linking of Expressed Rho with DSP—The HEK293 cell pellet was homogenized with 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. A cell suspension containing 380 μg/ml Rho was incubated with a 288-fold molar excess of DSP (50 mm stock solution) on ice for 30 min. After incubation, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 100 mm, and cell membranes were washed with phosphate buffer. The cell membrane pellets were stored at -80 °C or used immediately for Rho purification by affinity chromatography using the 1D4 antibody, which targets the C-terminal region of Rho.Rho 1D4 Affinity Chromatography—The cross-linked or control (non-cross-linked) cell membranes from HEK cells were lysed with a buffer consisting of 10 mm BisTris propane (BTP), 20 mm DM, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors (complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets; Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min using a Beckman ultracentrifuge. The supernatants were loaded on a 1D4-coupled CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences), and the flow-through fraction was reloaded onto the same column three times. The beads were washed with buffer containing 10 mm BTP, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DM, pH 7.5, until the absorbance at 280 nm was below 0.01. Finally, purified Rho was eluted with 100 μm nanopeptide TETSQVAPA (from the Rho C-terminal sequence) in the previous buffer at room temperature. The purified Rho concentration was determined using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A UV-visible spectrophotometer.ROS Membrane Solubilization—ROS membranes noncross-linked or cross-linked with DSP and BM(PEO)4 were solubilized in 10 mm BTP, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm DM or 40 mm CHAPS. The membrane suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged to remove insoluble material at 100,000 × g for 15 min using a Beckman ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was used for purification of Rho-detergent complexes and cross-linked Rho-detergent complexes by gel filtration chromatography.Purification of Gt—Gt was extracted from fresh ROS membranes (from 200 retinas) with 80 ml of ice-cold water. The membrane suspension was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected. The extraction was repeated twice. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 30 min to remove ROS membrane contaminations; mixed with buffer to the final concentrations of 10 mm MOPS, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5; and loaded onto hexyl-agarose resin (MP Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA) equilibrated with the same buffer as described previously (35Fung B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted by the stepwise addition of 75 mm NaCl and then 300 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing Gt and phosphodiesterase (PDE) eluted with 300 mm NaCl were dialyzed against 10 mm BTP, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5, and used to produce Rho-Gt complexes. For the Gt activity assay, Gt was purified from PDE by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) in the same buffer. The protein concentration was estimated using extinction coefficients determined according to the published method (36Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3400) Google Scholar) or quantified with a two-dimensional Quant kit (Amersham Biosciences).Rho-Gt Binding—Gt was bound to nontreated ROS membranes, purified Rho monomer, and the BM(PEO)4-treated Rho dimer and analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. Specifically, ROS membranes containing 100 μg of Rho were mixed with 150 μg of Gt in 10 mm BTP buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT; bleached three times by a photographic flashlight from a 5 cm distance; and incubated on ice for 15 min to form the complex. The excess Gt was washed out. ROS membranes with bound Gt were solubilized in 10 mm BTP buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT supplemented with 10 mm DM. The proteins were loaded onto a gel filtration column and equilibrated with 10 mm BTP, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 3 mm DM, pH 7.5. Rho BM(PEO)4 dimers or Rho monomers (50 μg each) were mixed with 75 μg of the Gt mixture. The complexed proteins were immediately loaded onto a gel filtration column.To measure Gt dissociation from the complex with Rho, 100 μm GTPγS (Sigma) was added after complex formation and removal of unbound Gt. After 30 min of incubation on ice, 10 mm DM was added to solubilize ROS membranes. Then the proteins were loaded onto a gel filtration column equilibrated with 10 mm BTP, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm DTT, 3 mm DM, and 10 μm GTPγS, pH 7.5.Gt Assay—In the fluorescence assay of Gt activation, the ratio of Gt to Rho was ∼9:1, with Gt at a concentration of 250 nm and Rho at 30 nm, within the linear range of fluorescence change and protein concentration. The sample was bleached for 15 s using a Fiber-Lite covered with a long pass wavelength filter (>490 nm), followed by a 10-min incubation with continuous low speed stirring. Then the intrinsic fluorescence increase from Gtα was measured with the PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B luminescence spectrophotometer, employing excitation and emission wavelengths at 300 and 345 nm, respectively (37Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 38Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10000-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). No signals from Rho without transducin were detected in the control experiment.Size Exclusion Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 10 mm BTP, 100 mm NaCl, and either 12 mm CHAPS detergent or DM at concentrations of 0.1, 1, or 3 mm. The column was run at room temperature with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Size exclusion chromatography was used to separate the Rho dimers obtained in cross-linking experiments from the monomers and for the Rho-Gt binding experiments. The absorbance at 280 and 500 nm of the eluate was monitored by a Cary 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Variant Inc., Walnut Creek, CA). Fractions containing proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-Gtα antibody (gift from Dr. H. E. Hamm, Vanderbilt University Medical Center) and polyclonal anti-Gtβ antibody (gift from Dr. O. Kisselev, St. Louis University School of Medicine). The void volume of the column (blue dextran 2000; Amersham Biosciences) was in fraction 23, and the column volume (NaN3) was eluted in fraction 62. The column was calibrated using ferritin (450 kDa), IgG (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.5 kDa). The standard proteins were run through the column with or without 3 mm DM. The detergent did not change the migration of the standard soluble proteins. The linear calibration curve representing the logarithm of molecular mass as a function of the fraction number was used to calculate the molecular mass of the Rho monomer-detergent complexes and Rho dimer-detergent complexes.SDS-PAGE, BN-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—Protein separation was performed on 10% SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue R250, silver staining, and immunoblotting (Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride; Millipore Corp.) were carried out according to standard protocols. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) was used as secondary antibody. Protein bands were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium color development substrate (Promega). Linear gradients of acrylamide (5-13%) BN-PAGE were prepared as described by Schägger and von Jagow (40Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar) but with the addition of 0.1% DM or 0.1% CHAPS. Gels were run in the dark.Protein Concentration Measurements and Rho Stability—Rho concentration was determined using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 800 UV-visible spectrophotometer in the range of 250-650 nm. Freshly purified Rho samples were incubated at 50 °C while monitored by UV-visible absorption spectra, with or without 20 mm neutral NH2OH. The recorded absorbance was read at 504 nm for 2 h. An S.D. value was calculated from three sets of data from parallel experiments.Meta II Decay Rate—All measurements were performed in 0.1 nm Rho dissolved in buffer consisting of 10 mm BTP, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DM, pH 6.0, which favors the formation of Meta II, the activated, signaling form of Rho. A PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B luminescence spectrophotometer was used to measure the intrinsic fluorescence increase due to Trp residues, which is correlated with the decrease in the protonated Schiff base concentration (data not shown, consistent with Refs. 41Farrens D.L.

Rho monomers or dimers purified by size exclusion chromatography were bleached by a Fiber-Lite illuminator for 15 s immediately before the fluorescence measurements. Bleaching was carried out from a distance of 15 cm to prevent heat accumulation, and a thermostat was applied to stabilize the temperature of the cuvette at 20 °C. Fluorometer slit settings were 2.5 nm at 295 nm for excitation, and 8.0 nm at 330 nm for emission.Phosphorylation of Rho Dimer and Monomer—Freshly separated Rho monomers or dimers (2 μg each) were mixed in 20 μl of 20 mm BTP, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (100 to ∼150 cpm/pmol) and purified Rho kinase (∼0.1 μg of protein), and the assay was carried out as described previously (45Buczylko J. Gutmann C. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2568-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reacted mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 12.5% gel. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried, followed by performance of an autoradiogram.Molecular Model of the Rho Dimer—A molecular model of Rho tetramer was taken from the Protein Data Bank entry 1N3M (17Filipek S.

No optimization was performed, since Rho molecules from other rows of dimers contact via helices-I on their extracellular sides only.RESULTSTwo cross-linking reagents were used to explore Rho oligomerization in native membranes and in mild detergents. DSP is a selective cross-linker for primary amines, such as Lys residues (Fig. 1A). There are many more exposed Lys residues than exposed Cys (Fig. 1C) in the model. Any link between Lys141, Lys231, Lys245, and Lys248 from monomer a and Lys66, Lys67, and Lys339 from monomer c is possible (Fig. 1C, yellow circle). Lys325 and Lys311 are too far from the other monomers to allow cross-linking. The second cross-linker is BM(PEO)4, which is a cross-linking reagent for cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups (Fig. 1B) used to specifically link Cys140 and/or Cys316, two reactive Cys residues. The model of the arrangement of Rho dimers in the native membranes (17Filipek S. Krzysko K.A. Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 628-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) suggests that only one possibility for bridging Cys140-Cys140 from Rho monomers a and d exists (Fig. 1C, green circle).Cross-linking of ROS Membranes—ROS membranes isolated from bovine retinas were cross-linked with DSP.2 As shown in Fig. 2A, lane 1, Rho dimers and higher oligomers were formed concurrently with a decrease in the amount of Rho monomers compared with the untreated control (Fig. 2A, lane 5). To discriminate between cross-link products and nonspecific oligomerization, we took advantage of the fact that DSP is a thiol-cleavable cross-linker. Rho dimers obtained with DSP were reduced by DTT, and the majority of them returned to the monomeric form (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), showing that the cross-linking was a result of chemical reaction and not nonspecific aggregation. In control experiments, we tested whether Rho cross-linked to peripherin, another protein of disc membranes. Although segregation of both proteins in disc membranes cannot be excluded, highly mobile monomeric Rho would collide with peripherin as frequently as with itself. Peripherin was cross-linked to form higher order structures in conditions where Rho was mostly dimeric; howeve"
https://openalex.org/W2168918061,"The digestive vacuole plasmepsins PfPM1, PfPM2, PfPM4, and PfHAP (a histoaspartic proteinase) are 4 aspartic proteinases among 10 encoded in the Plasmodium falciparum malarial genome. These have been hypothesized to initiate and contribute significantly to hemoglobin degradation, a catabolic function essential to the survival of this intraerythrocytic parasite. Because of their perceived significance, these plasmepsins have been proposed as potential targets for antimalarial drug development. To test their essentiality, knockout constructs were prepared for each corresponding gene such that homologous recombination would result in two partial, nonfunctional gene copies. Disruption of each gene was achieved, as confirmed by PCR, Southern, and Northern blot analyses. Western and two-dimensional gel analyses revealed the absence of mature or even truncated plasmepsins corresponding to the disrupted gene. Reduced growth rates were observed with PfPM1 and PfPM4 knockouts, indicating that although these plasmepsins are not essential, they are important for parasite development. Abnormal mitochondrial morphology also appeared to accompany loss of PfPM2, and an abundant accumulation of electron-dense vesicles in the digestive vacuole was observed upon disruption of PfPM4; however, those phenotypes only manifested in about a third of the disrupted cells. The ability to compensate for loss of individual plasmepsin function may be explained by close similarity in the structure and active site of these four vacuolar enzymes. Our data imply that drug discovery efforts focused on vacuolar plasmepsins must incorporate measures to develop compounds that can inhibit two or more of this enzyme family.

Malaria remains a public health problem of enormous magnitude in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, annually afflicting an estimated 500 million people and killing nearly 2 million, mostly children (1Breman J.G. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 64: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 2Trigg P.I. Kondrachine A.V. Bull. W. H. O. 1998; 76: 11-16PubMed Google Scholar). Of the four species of malaria parasites that infect humans, the most lethal one, Plasmodium falciparum, is becoming increasingly resistant to the available drugs, making it essential to pursue the development of new antimalarial compounds that act on essential parasite pathways unencumbered by current mechanisms of drug resistance (3Fidock D.A. Rosenthal P.J. Croft S.L. Brun R. Nwaka S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). One validated pathway whose metabolic function is unique to the parasite is hemoglobin digestion, which results in the sequestration of free ferriprotoporphyrin IX as an inert, crystalline form (hemozoin) in the digestive vacuole (DV) 1The abbreviations used are: DV, digestive vacuole; PfHAP, P. falciparum histoaspartic protease; PfPM, P. falciparum plasmepsin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; IEF, isoelectric focusing. of the parasite. Previous studies by others suggest that hemoglobin digestion is a semiordered process initiated in the DV by two aspartic proteinases named plasmepsins (plasmodium pepsins) I and II (PfPM1 and PfPM2, respectively). These enzymes can mediate the first cleavage of the Phe33–Leu34 bond in the hinge region of the α chain, causing the whole molecule to unravel in the acidic DV environment (4Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y.

Genome sequencing and subcellular localization studies have identified two additional DV plasmepsins, a histoaspartic proteinase (PfHAP) and plasmepsin 4 (PfPM4) that are thought to be involved in hemoglobin degradation (8Wyatt D.M.

Their capacity to digest native hemoglobin is significantly less than that of PfPM1 or PfPM2, but both actively cleave globin as demonstrated in vitro (10Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L.

Cysteine proteases falcipain 2, 2*, and 3, plus the metalloprotease falcilysin, are believed to be involved in further degrading large hemoglobin fragments into short peptides and free heme (12Eggleson K.K.

In addition, this process may provide the means for the parasite to regulate intracellular osmolarity during its maturation and replication in the red blood cell (21Krugliak M. Zhang J.M. Ginsburg H.

To address whether these DV plasmepsins are critical, we performed gene disruption experiments and report our findings herein. Parasite Cultivation, Synchronization, and Release from Erythrocytes—P. falciparum parasites were cultured as described (28Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar, 29Haynes J.D. Diggs C.L. Hines F.A. Desjardins R.E. Nature. 1976; 263: 767-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) at 4% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with 0.5% Albumax (Invitrogen), 0.225% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamycin. Parasites were synchronized using 5% sorbitol when they were mainly in the ring stage. The parasites used for RNA and protein preparations were collected at ∼12-h intervals. The parasitemia and the synchronicity of each culture was determined by microscopic examination of Giemsa or Protocol Hema (Fisher)-stained smears. Knockout Constructs—Internal 0.7-kb fragments from PfPM1 (nucleotides 481–1195, GenBank™ accession number X75787), PfPM2 (nucleotides 483–1200, GenBank™ accession number L10740), PfPM4 (nucleotides 481–1195, PlasmoDB gene Pf14_0075), and PfHAP (nucleotides 481–1186 GenBank™ accession number AJ009990) were amplified by PCR from parasite genomic DNA. JNB196 (5′-GCATGGATCCGCAAATTTATGGGTTCCAAG-3′) plus JNB195 (5′-GCATGCGGCCGCTTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCTGCTGCGTTGTAAGTAGTATTCTGGTTCTAAGG-3′) were used for PfPM1; JNB197 (5′-GCATGGATCCGCTAATTTATGGGTCCCAAGTGTTA-3′) plus JNB199 (5′-GCATGCGGCCGCTTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCTGCAGCGTGTTGAAGGTAGTATTCAGGTTC-3′) were used for PfPM2; JNB200 (5′-GCATGGATCCTCTAATGTATATGGGTACCCAGTATA-3′) plus JNB-202 (5′-GCATGCGGCCGCTTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCTGCAGCGGTTCAAGGTATTGTTTAGGTTC-3′) were used for PfHAP; and JNB203 (5′-GCATGGATCCGCTAATTTATGGGTTCCAAGTG-3′) plus JNB205 (5′-GCATGCGGCCGCTTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCTGCAGCGGGTCCATATAGAATTCAGGTTC-3′) were used for PfPM4. 5′ primers introduced a BamHI restriction site, and 3′ primers introduced a NotI restriction site. The resulting PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the P. falciparum transfection vector pHD22Y, which uses human dihydrofolate reductase as the selectable marker (30Fidock D.A. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10931-10936Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This yielded the 6.6-kb constructs pHD-ΔPM1, pHD-ΔPM2, pHD-ΔPM4, and pHD-ΔHAP (Fig. 1). Probes for Southern and Northern Blot Analysis—These were prepared from the 0.7-kb PCR product used to prepare each knockout construct by random primer labeling (Stratagene) with [α-32P]dATP. These PCR products were found not to cross-hybridize with one another when used as probes under stringent hybridization and wash conditions. Parasite Transfection and Cloning—P. falciparum transfections were performed by electroporating parasitized erythrocyte cultures as described (31Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Wellems T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Transfected parasites were selected in culture medium containing 2.5 nm WR99210 (a P. falciparum-specific antifolate kindly provided by Dr. David Jacobus, Jacobus Pharmaceuticals, Princeton, NJ). Initially, plasmids replicated episomally until recombination occurred with homologous chromosomal sequences, leading to genomic integration via single crossover (32Wu Y. Kirkman L.A. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1130-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Integration of each knockout construct into the parasite genome was detected by PCR with the primer combinations p1/p4 and p3/p2, which were specific for integration events (Fig. 1A). The use of p1 with p2 detected the wild-type gene, and p3 with p4 detected episomal plasmids (Fig. 1A). Primers 1 and 2 for PfPM1 were JNB9 (5′-CCGGAATTCCGAGGATCCTCAAAACATGTAATAATTGGA-3′) and JNB10 (5′-CCGGAATTCGGATCCCGTGATTTACAATTTTTTTTTGGC-3′); for PfPM2 were JNB266 (5′-TCCGAACATTTAACTATTGGATTTAAAG-3′) and JNB267 (5′-GCAAGAGCAATACCAACACTG-3′); for PfHAP were JNB268 (5′-GACTTCAAAATATTCGACAGTAGGA-3′) and JNB269 (5′-GCTAAAGCAAATCCAACGGTG-3′); and for PfPM4 were JNB135 (5′-CCGGAATTCCGAGGATCCACAAAACACAAACTATAGG-3′) and JNB137 (5′-CCGAATTCGGATCCTTATAAATTTTTAGCTACTGC-3′), respectively. Primers 3 and 4 were JNB207 (5′-CCTAATCATGTAAATCTTAAATTTTTC-3′) and T3 (5′-GCAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′), respectively. Mutant plasmepsin-disrupted lines were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar, Corning, NY) and detected after 21 days using the Malstat assay that detects expression of parasite lactate dehydrogenase (33Goodyer I.D. Taraschi T.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Plasmid integration into the parasite genome was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using the 32P-labeled DNA probes described above. Southern and Northern Blot Analysis—Parasites were prepared free of excess erythrocytes by treatment with 0.05% saponin and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Genomic DNA was extracted using TELT lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 62.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2.5 m LiCl, 4% Triton X-100) (34Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The DNA was further purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, Fisher) deproteination, and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. Following restriction enzyme digestion, DNA samples were separated on 1% agarose gels and blotted onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Total parasite RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and purified by isopropyl alcohol precipitation. Quantification used both absorbance at 260 nm and agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining. For Northern blots, ∼6 μg of total RNA was loaded per well, resolved on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels, blotted onto Hybond N+ membranes, and hybridized with 32P-labeled DNA probes. Isolation of DV—These were prepared from sorbitol-synchronized cultures of P. falciparum trophozoites, using a method from Saliba et al. (35Saliba K.J. Folb P.I. Smith P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with major modifications. Briefly, 100 ml of culture containing trophozoites at 5–10% parasitema was treated with 0.05% saponin, and the free parasites were immediately collected by centrifugation. Parasites were washed twice by resuspension in ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose) followed by centrifugation. Washed pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer, transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and triturated four times through a 27-gauge needle (4 s per trituration). Samples were centrifuged at 13,800 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. Supernatants were discarded, and pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of uptake buffer (2 mm MgSO4, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm Na3PO4 (pH 7.4)) to which was added 50 μl of 1 unit/μl DNase. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, samples were centrifuged at 13,800 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. Supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in 0.1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer and then mixed with 1.3 ml of ice-cold 42% Percoll prepared in 0.25 m sucrose, 1.5 mm MgSO4 (pH 7.4). Mixtures were triturated two times through a 27-gauge needle (9 s per trituration) and centrifuged at 13,800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The DV appeared as a dark band in the bottom 50 μl of the Percoll gradient. These were collected and transferred to clean 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and washed twice with ice-cold wash buffer, involving centrifugation at 13,800 × g at 4 °C for 2 min and removal of the supernatant each time. After the second wash, the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of IEF sample buffer (9 m deionized urea, 4% CHAPS, 60 mm DTT, 0.8% ampholytes (pH 3–10)) and 10 μlof10× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Samples were stored at –80 °C. Prior to use, samples were thawed, vortexed, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g at room temperature for 5 min. Supernatants were used in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described below. Two-dimensional PAGE—This was performed by using a Multiphor II Electrophoresis Unit equipped with a MultiDrive EPS 3501XL gradient power supply (Amersham Biosciences). Precast Immobiline Drystrips (IEF strips, pH 4–7 linear, 180 × 3 × 0.5 mm) were rehydrated overnight (in a re-swelling cassette (Amersham Biosciences)) with 50-μl DV extracts and brought up to 125 μl with re-swelling buffer (8 m urea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 2% (v/v) IPG buffer (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.002% bromphenol blue). Just prior to use, DTT was added at a final concentration of 3 mg/ml. Rehydration buffer and stock DTT (62.5 mg/ml) were stored at –20 °C. Rehydrated IEF strips were isoelectrically focused at 15 °C under low viscosity oil (Fisher) with a gradient voltage of 0–200 V for 1 min, 200–3,500 V for 1.5 h, and a constant voltage of 3,500 V for 1.5 h. The IEF strips were equilibrated for 15 min in 10 ml of SDS equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue), and DTT was added at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml immediately before use. The second dimension was SDS-PAGE, performed according to the method of Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with precast 10% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). The equilibrated IEF strips were each placed on a preparative well and sealed using 1% agarose plus 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol. After electrophoresis the two-dimensional gels were silver-stained by using a MALDI-TOF-compatible silver-staining protocol (37O'Connell K.L. Stults J.T. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Spots corresponding to each plasmepsin were excised and confirmed by MALDI-TOF analysis (38Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar) (performed by Kendrick Laboratories Inc., Madison, WI). Gel images were documented with an AlphaImager IS-1000. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Parasites were lysed in 1× RIPA Lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) containing the protease inhibitors pepstatin (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (1.5 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Lysates were then treated with an equal volume of 2% SDS as described (39Omara-Opyene A.L. Gedamu L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 247-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and their concentrations were adjusted to ensure equal protein loading. Bio-Rad sample buffer was added to the solubilized protein to a final concentration of 1× prior to boiling for 5 min and loading onto 12% polyacrylamide gels (39Omara-Opyene A.L. Gedamu L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 247-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Membranes were hybridized with primary antibodies as described (10Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution, Pierce). Immunoreactivity was detected using the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Electron Microscopy—For electron microscopy, infected red blood cells or DV preparations were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 4% sucrose, for 30 min at room temperature followed by 90 min at 4 °C. Cells were then postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. After a 30-min en bloc stain with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate, cells were dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol and embedded in Epon 812. Ultrathin sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 50% methanol and lead citrate and examined using a Zeiss CEM902 electron microscope (Oberkochen, Germany). Generation of PfPM1-, PfPM2-, PfPM4-, and PfHAP-disrupted Clones—P. falciparum Dd2 asexual stage parasites were transfected by electroporation using the plasmepsin knockout constructs pHD-ΔPM1, pHD-ΔPM2, pHD-ΔPM4, or pHD-ΔHAP. Episomally transfected parasites, selected with WR99210, were first visualized by day 14–16 post-electroporation, and integration was detected by PCR by day 104 post-electroporation for all lines. Plasmepsin knockout parasites were subsequently cloned by limiting dilution. The Tx1.A3 and Tx2.B6 clones were isolated and characterized from the transfections with pHD-ΔPM1 and pHD2-ΔPM2, respectively. Transfection with pHD-ΔHAP gave rise to the clones Tx3.C3, Tx3.F11, and Tx3.G7, whereas the pHD-ΔPM4 transfection resulted in the clones Tx4.F8, Tx4.H12, Tx4.B10. For all clones disruption of the intact parental plasmepsin gene was confirmed by PCR (data not shown). Southern Blot Analysis—To confirm the integration of the separate constructs into the plasmepsin gene loci, we carried out Southern blot analysis with gene-specific probes (Fig. 2). For every knockout clone, the banding patterns were consistent with integration of a single plasmid copy leading to disruption of the targeted plasmepsin. Details are provided in the Fig. 1 legend. In view of the identical results obtained between the independent clones, for HAP and PfPM4, we chose to pursue our investigations using a single representative clone for each locus, namely Tx1.A3, Tx2.B6, Tx3.C3, and Tx4.F8. These are referred to hereafter simply as Tx1, Tx2, Tx3, and Tx4. Northern Blot Analysis—To determine the effect of gene disruption on the expression and stability of the altered mRNAs of each DV plasmepsin in the respective knockout clones, we performed Northern blot analyses by using gene-specific probes. For this, total RNA was collected at four time points from synchronized parasite clones. The normal size of the mRNA for PfPM1 is 4.0 kb, for PfPM2 is 2.4 kb, for PfHAP is 2.4 kb, and for PfPM4 is 4.0 kb (Fig. 3). None of the four knockout mutants expressed a comparably sized transcript from the disrupted gene locus in the asexual cycle. Instead, all four expressed an abnormally large RNA present in nearly all stages of the asexual cycle (Fig. 3). This product also hybridized to a probe prepared from the pHD22Y plasmid vector (without plasmepsin sequence; data not shown). Thus, the large mRNA transcript had both plasmepsin and plasmid sequences. The significance of the slight fluctuations in the intensity of this band from different stages of various knockouts is uncertain. Two other transcripts also hybridized with the plasmepsin probes, one larger and one slightly smaller than the 2.37-kb marker. These are most prominent on the Tx3 RNA blot, which had been washed at moderate stringency. Corresponding bands may be seen at lower intensity on Tx1, Tx2, and Tx4 blots washed at high stringency (Fig. 3, A, B, and D). All of these abnormal RNAs that hybridized with the plasmepsin probe also hybridized to a probe prepared from the pHD22Y vector alone, indicating transcription from the chromosome-integrated truncated plasmepsin plasmid sequences. For all knockout clones, additional Northern blot analyses revealed that individual gene disruptions were not accompanied by changes in transcript sizes of the other DV plasmepsins. Representative data are shown in Fig. 3C, where RNA from Tx2 was included as a control to demonstrate the normal size of the PfHAP mRNA (which was the same for Tx2 and Dd2). Two-dimensional PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—To compare the plasmepsins present in DV preparations from Dd2 and each of the four knockout clones, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The first dimension was isoelectric focusing performed on an Immobiline gel strip (pH 4–7), and the second dimension was electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE slab gel. As shown in Fig. 4, PfPM1, PfPM2, PfHAP, and PfPM4 were all identified in Dd2 DV preparations. The identity of each of these spots in Dd2 was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopic analysis. For each knockout clone, the expected individual plasmepsin spot was absent. We note that whereas these results demonstrate the presence of the expected individual plasmepsins in these DV preparations, the overall protein complexity is somewhat overestimated because of the co-purification of some free merozoites as detected by electron microscopy (data not shown). Because each knockout construct was designed to generate two truncated gene fragments, and thereby potentially result in two partial protein fragments with differing molecular masses and isoelectric points, whole parasite preparations of each knockout line were further examined by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for each plasmepsin. No form of PfPM1 was detected by this technique in ring, early trophozoite, late trophozoite, or schizont stages of Tx1, for which proteins in the range of 14–200 kDa could be observed by Coomassie staining (Fig. 5A). Similarly, no forms of PfPM2, PfHAP, and PfPM4 were detected by the antibodies employed in blots of Tx2, Tx3, and Tx4, respectively, over this same size range (data not shown). These analyses demonstrated the reactivity of each antibody against the corresponding plasmepsin in Dd2 (Fig. 5B). As a control, anti-PfPM2 antibodies were reacted with blots of the same extracts, demonstrating the presence of PfPM2 in all lines except for Tx2. In this instance, anti-PfPM1 antisera was used as a control to demonstrate the presence of PfPM1. Comparative Growth in Culture—During the propagation of these recombinant lines, we observed a noticeable effect of certain plasmepsin gene disruptions on rates of growth. To study this, we sorbitol-synchronized our knockout clones and the parental line, initiated cultures at 0.5% parasitemia, and quantified the increase in parasitemia over 96 h. In similar experiments, the parasite rate of multiplication was followed for 2 weeks, adjusting the parasitemia every 48 h to begin at 1%. Both types of assays revealed a 30–50% decrease in parasite multiplication in Tx1 and Tx4 relative to Dd2. This prompted us to analyze growth rates from parasitemia measurements recorded over an 18-month period, which should minimize any short term differences arising from sorbitol treatment or culture care. Data points were retained only when parasitemias were calculated at the beginning and end of a 48-h generation period, and measurements were only selected from periods when parasites were growing robustly, typically in the range of 0.7–6.0% parasitemia. Measurements meeting these criteria totaled 27–45 independent data points over 18 months of culture. These revealed a statistically significant 30–35% decrease in growth rates of the Tx1 and Tx4 lines relative to Dd2 (Table I). A slight drop in growth rates was also observed for Tx3, although this was not statistically significant, whereas Tx2 grew at least as well as Dd2"

Replicative senescence, due to the shortening and dysfunction of telomeres, appears to provide a barrier to the immortalization of cells and development of cancer. In normal human fibroblasts, senescence induced by oncogenic H-ras displays a nearly identical cellular phenotype to that of replicative senescence, suggesting the activation of a common senescence mechanism. In this study, we investigated the gene expression profile of oncogenic H-ras-induced senescent human diploid fibroblasts. We found altered gene expression of various cell cycle regulators in both oncogenic H-ras-induced senescent cells and replicative senescent cells. Similar to replicative senescent cells, H-ras-induced senescent cells exhibited specific downregulation of genes involved in G2/M checkpoint control and contained tetraploid cells that were arrested in a G1 state. This observation suggests that the inactivation of G2/M checkpoints may be involved in senescence and may play a role in the generation of senescent G1 tetraploid cells. Lastly, we have identified two genes, topoisomerase IIα and HDAC9, whose expression was specifically altered under several conditions associated with senescence, suggesting that these two molecules may be novel biomarkers for senescent human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2154042815,"Mutations of parkin, a protein-ubiquitin E3 ligase, are linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). Although a variety of parkin substrates have been identified, none of these is selectively expressed in dopaminergic neurons, whose degeneration plays a critical role in PD. Here we show that parkin significantly increased dopamine uptake in the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. This effect was accompanied by increased Vmax of dopamine uptake and unchanged Km. Consistent with this, increased binding sites for dopamine transporter (DAT) ligand were observed in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing parkin. The results were confirmed when parkin was transfected in HEK293 cells stably expressing DAT. In these cells, parkin enhanced the ubiquitination and degradation of DAT, increased its cell surface expression, and augmented dopamine uptake. The effects of parkin were significantly abrogated by its PD-causing mutations. Because the cell surface expression of functional DAT requires its oligomerization, misfolded DAT, induced either by the protein glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin or by its C-terminal truncation, significantly attenuated cell surface expression of native DAT and reduced dopamine uptake. Expression of parkin, but not its T240R mutant, significantly alleviated these detrimental effects of misfolded DAT. Thus, our studies suggest that parkin increases dopamine uptake by enhancing the ubiquitination and degradation of misfolded DAT, so as to prevent it from interfering with the oligomerization and cell surface expression of native DAT. This function of parkin would enhance the precision of dopaminergic transmission, increase the efficiency of dopamine utilization, and reduce dopamine toxicity on neighboring cells."
https://openalex.org/W2023210471,"Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) of the pancreas are uncommon neoplasms usually located in the body or tail of the pancreas and usually in females (>90% of cases). Clinically, they are often misdiagnosed as non-neoplastic pseudocysts leading to failed opportunities for curative resection. To better understand the biology of MCNs and to identify markers of the disease, we performed global gene expression profiling of MCNs using oligonucleotide microarrays. Using laser capture microdissection applied to frozen sections, RNA was extracted from the neoplastic epithelium of MCNs, from the adjacent ‘ovarian-type’ stroma of MCNs, from histologically normal pancreatic ductal epithelium, from pancreatic acinar tissue and from fibrous stroma in pancreata affected by chronic pancreatitis. Each RNA sample was subjected to two rounds of linear amplification followed by hybridization with U133A gene chips (Affymetrix). The expression patterns of selected genes were confirmed by quantitative RT–PCR and by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays containing 19 resected MCNs. A total of 114 known genes were overexpressed in the neoplastic epithelium compared to normal pancreatic ductal epithelium (>3-fold) including S100P, PSCA, c-myc, STK6/STK15, cathepsin E and pepsinogen C. Activation of the Notch pathway in the epithelial component of MCNs was evident by the demonstration of overexpression of Jagged1 and the downstream Notch pathway member Hes1. In the ‘ovarian-type’ stroma, several genes involved in estrogen metabolism were overexpressed including STAR and ESR1 genes. Some of the genes identified as overexpressed in these neoplasms may be useful as markers that can distinguish MCNs from non-neoplastic pancreatic cystic lesions."

We show that the Huntingtin interacting protein 14 (HIP14) is a PAT with a preference for the farnesyl-dependent palmitoylation motif found in H- and N-RAS. Characterization of HIP14 in mouse cells has revealed that it has the ability to induce colony formation in cell culture, anchorage-independent growth, and tumors in mice.

Complementarity-determining region (CDR) mutagenesis is used to increase antibody affinity but can be difficult to perform successfully. We previously showed that antibodies with increased affinity and immunotoxins with increased activity could be obtained by directing mutations at specific DNA residues called hot spots. Because hot spots can arise either by somatic mutation or be present in the germline, we examined which type of hot spot is preferred for increasing antibody affinity. Initially, a second generation antibody phage-display library targeting a germline hot spot (Ser30-Asn31) within CDR1 of the antibody light chain was mutated. Substitution of serine 30 or asparagine 31 with arginine produced mutant immunotoxins with an affinity (0.8 nm) increased 7-fold over BL22 (5.8 nm) and 3-fold over the first generation mutant HA22 (2.3 nm). More importantly, a 10-fold increase in activity over BL22 and a 2-3-fold increase over HA22 were observed in various B lymphoma cell lines including WSU-CLL that contains only 5500 CD22 sites per cell. For comparison, two phage-display libraries targeting non-germline hot spots in heavy chain CDR1 and CDR3 were generated but did not produce Fv with increased affinity.

Hematological malignancies remain a major public health problem. In the past several years, immunotoxins have been developed as a new therapeutic approach to treat these malignancies. Immunotoxins are composed of antibodies or their Fv biochemically or genetically linked to toxins, toxin subunits, or ribosome-inactivating proteins from bacteria, plants, or fungi (reviewed in Refs. 1Frankel A.E.

Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2003; 52: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The antibody portion binds to the antigen expressed on the target cell, and the toxin is internalized and causes cell death by arresting protein synthesis and inducing apoptosis. Hematological malignancies are attractive targets for immunotoxin therapy because the tumor cells are easily accessible to the therapeutic agent (4Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CD22 is a lineage-restricted B cell antigen expressed in about 70% of B cell lymphomas and leukemias. Because CD22 is not expressed on stem cells and in the early stages of B cell development (5Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 5: 481-504Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar), it is an attractive target for cancer therapy. Clinical trials have been conducted with RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 (BL22), a recombinant immunotoxin containing an anti-CD22 murine monoclonal antibody RFB4 (6Campana D. Janossy G. Bofill M. Trejdosiewicz L.K.

BL22 was engineered by inserting a disulfide bond in the framework region so that it holds the Fv together but does not interfere with binding to antigen (7Brinkmann U. Reiter Y. Jung S.H. Lee B.

Blood. 1997; 90: 2020-2026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BL22 is able to kill leukemic cells from patients and induced complete remissions in mice bearing lymphoma xenografts (9Kreitman R.J.

Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1476-1487PubMed Google Scholar). BL22 has been evaluated in a phase I clinical trial at the NCI, National Institutes of Health, in patients with hematological malignancies. Sixteen patients with purine analogue-resistant hairy cell leukemia (HCL) 1The abbreviations used are: HCL, hairy cell leukemia; CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; CDR, complementarity-determining region; scFv, single chain Fv; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; BCR, B cell receptor. were treated with BL22 and 11 (86%) achieved complete remissions (11Kreitman R.J.

BL22 is the first agent that is able to induce a high complete remission rate in patients with purine analogue-resistant HCL and confirms the concept that immunotoxins can produce clinical benefit to patients with advanced malignancies. Because of the clinical benefits obtained with BL22, we decided to improve this molecule by increasing its affinity and consequently its activity. This should lead to an increase in its activity in patients with malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in which the cells have relatively small amounts of CD22 on the cell surface (10Kreitman R.J.

Recently, a strategy using hypermutating B cell lines mimicking the natural somatic hypermutation has been developed (20Cumbers S.J. Williams G.T. Davies S.L. Grenfell R.L. Takeda S. Batista F.D. Sale J.E. Neuberger M.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have developed an approach mimicking somatic hypermutation to increase antibody affinity by using small antibody phage-display libraries (21Chowdhury P.S. Pastan I. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We used a few hot spots in the antibody complementarity determining regions (CDR) that are naturally prone to hypermutations (22Neuberger M.S. Milstein C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Hot spots RGYW (R = A or G, Y = C or T, and W = T or A) are DNA sequences that are frequently mutated during the in vivo affinity maturation of an antibody (22Neuberger M.S. Milstein C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 23Jolly C.J. Wagner S.D. Rada C. Klix N. Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Semin.

We introduced random mutations around these sites by PCR and made phage-display libraries with a minimum size of only 103 and 104 independent clones (26Beers R. Chowdhury P. Bigner D. Pastan I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2835-2843PubMed Google Scholar). Panning of these small hot spot libraries has yielded mutant immunotoxins with an increase in activity (21Chowdhury P.S. Pastan I. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 26Beers R. Chowdhury P. Bigner D. Pastan I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2835-2843PubMed Google Scholar, 27Salvatore G. Beers R. Margulies I. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar). One of these is immunotoxin HA22 that has a mutation in a hot spot region of heavy chain CDR3 (27Salvatore G. Beers R. Margulies I. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that a directed evolution approach targeting a different hot spot in each generation would allow us to sequentially increase the activity of immunotoxins. This uphill-climbing strategy has the major advantage that in each generation the library size is small and easy to make, whereas it is technically very difficult to produce large phage libraries where many nucleotides and amino acids in the Fv are randomly mutated. Because large changes in antibody affinity can result from accumulating point mutations, each with small effects (28Hawkins R.E. Russell S.J. Baier M. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the capability to identify slight improvements in each generation could be of significant value. Here we have used immunotoxin HA22 as a starting point, and we examined the effect of mutating hot spots in germline residues or nongermline residues that have already undergone somatic mutation. We observed that mutation of germline hot spots but not non-germline hot spots resulted in Fv with increased affinity and immunotoxins with increased activity. Cell Culture—Daudi, Namalwa, Ramos, MCF7, and 293T cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown as described previously (8Mansfield E. Amlot P. Pastan I. FitzGerald D.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 2020-2026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Salvatore G. Beers R. Margulies I. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar). The WSU-CLL line was kindly provided by Dr. A. Al-Katib (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI) and grown as described (29Mohammad R.M. Mohamed A.N. Hamdan M.Y. Vo T. Chen B. Katato K. Abubakr Y.A. Dugan M.C. al-Katib A. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1996; 10: 130-137PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Phage-display Libraries—In the present study, we constructed 3-s generation phage-display libraries by mutagenizing hot spots in light chain CDR1 and heavy chain CDR1 or CDR3 of the HA22 Fv portion. HA22 Fv was a first generation mutant of RFB4 obtained by phage-display targeting the antibody heavy chain CDR3 hot spots (27Salvatore G. Beers R. Margulies I. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar). DNA oligomers were designed to generate a library randomizing 6 or 9 nucleotides (2 or 3 consecutive amino acids). Degenerate oligomers with the sequence NNS were used (N randomizing with all four nucleotides and S introducing only C or G). The phagemid pCANTAB5E-G3 for display of HA22 single chain Fv (scFv) on the surface of bacteriophage M13 was made according to a previous procedure (27Salvatore G. Beers R. Margulies I. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar). The vector was modified by inserting a BspHI site (TCA TGA) containing a stop codon (underlined) at the hot spot positions using site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting phagemids pCANTAB5E-G3-VL30/31BspHI, pCANTAB5E-G3-VH30/31BspHI, and pCANTAB5E-G3-VH96/97/98BspHI were used as a template to introduce two or three amino acid randomizations in a two-step PCR (26Beers R. Chowdhury P. Bigner D. Pastan I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2835-2843PubMed Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used: S1, 5′-CAACGTGAAAAAATTATTATTCGC-3′; RFB4VL30/31, 5′-AGTCAGGACATTNNSNNSTATTTAAACTGG-3′; RFB4VH30/31, 5′-GGATTCGCTTTCNNSNNSTATGACATGTCT-3′; RFB4VH96/97/98, 5′-TACTGTGCAAGACATNNSNNSNNSGGTACGCACTGGGGG-3′; and AMBN, 5′-GCTAAACAACTTTCAACAGTCTATGCGGCAC-3′. In the first PCR, 50 pg of the phagemid pCANTAB5E-G3-VL30/31BspHI, pCANTAB5E-G3-VH-30/31BspHI, or pCANTAB5E-G3-VH96/97/98BspHI was used as the template in each library using 20 pmol of DNA oligomers AMBN along with 20 pmol of the DNA oligomers RFB4VL30/31, RFB4VH30/31, or RFB4VH96/97/98. The template and oligonucleotides were mixed with two Ready-To-Go PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) in a 50-μl volume and then cycled using the following profile: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. This reaction generated a 344-bp product that contained the mutations. The product was purified using a Qiagen Quick Spin column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and then quantitated by visualization on a 1% agarose gel. The purified products generated in the first PCR were used as primers in a second PCR. In this reaction, 2 pmol of the product from the first reaction was used with 20 pmol of the DNA oligomer S1 with 50 pg of template phagemid. The primers and template were mixed with two PCR beads in a 50-μl volume and cycled using the profile described above. The reaction generated an 884-bp insert library. The PCR product was digested with SfiI and NotI and purified by using a QIAquick column (Qiagen). Purified PCR product (150 ng) was ligated with 250 ng of pre-cut phage-display vector pCANTAB 5E (Amersham Biosciences) and desalted. Forty ng of the ligation was used to transform TG1 electroporation-competent Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene). Each transformation produced a phage-display library containing ∼2 × 104 independent clones. For LibVH96/97/98, five independent transformations were performed to produce more than 1 × 105 independent clones. The phage library was rescued from the transformed bacteria, titered, and stored at 4 °C. Biopanning on Cells—Biopanning was performed on MCF7 cells to remove phage that bind to cells nonspecifically and CD22-positive Daudi cells to enrich for CD22-binding phage. For phage absorption, MCF7 cells (>5 × 107) were pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml of cold blocking buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline + 5% BSA + 0.1% NaN3). Phage (∼1 × 1012 plaque-forming units) from each library were added to the cell suspension, and the mixture was rotated slowly at 4 °C for 90 min. The cells were then pelleted, and the supernatants (10 ml) containing unbound phage were incubated with Daudi cells (1 × 106) and rotated slowly for 90 min at 4 °C. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 10 ml of cold blocking buffer. The cells were then washed six times with 1 ml of cold blocking buffer for the first and second round of panning. At the third panning, the cells were washed 16 times. Bound phage were eluted by resuspending the washed cells in 0.5 ml of ice-cold 50 mm HCl (pH 1.5) and incubating on ice for 10 min. Daudi cells were pelleted, and the eluted phages were transferred to a tube containing 100 μl of 1 m Tris (pH 8). The eluted phages were titered to determine the number of phage captured. The eluted phage (∼0.6 ml) were then amplified by reinfecting E. coli TG1 for use in the next round of panning. Preparation and Purification of CD22—The extracellular domain of CD22 protein was expressed as a fusion to human IgG Fc in transfected 293T cells containing pCDNA1.1-22-Fc, a plasmid encoding the extracellular domain of human CD22, as described previously (27Salvatore G. Beers R. Margulies I. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid was transfected into 293T cells by Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen), and the CD22-Fc protein was harvested from the culture supernatant and purified with Hi-Trap protein A column (Amersham Biosciences). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Phages or scFv were prepared from single colonies of E. coli TG1 containing phagemids selected in panning. In order to normalize the scFv expression, we performed a dot blot analysis in which serial dilutions of phage or scFv were spotted on a membrane. The amount of scFv was detected with an anti-E TAG antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The colorimetric intensity of each dot was measured with the NIH Image program (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/Default.html). ELISA were performed using CD22-Fc fusion proteins. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates (Maxi-sorb; NUNC, Rochester, NY) were coated with goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) (0.5 μg/well) in 50 mm bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.5) at 4 °C overnight, washed, blocked with 1% of BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 1 h, and washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). CD22-Fc fusion proteins, 5 μg/ml in PBST containing 1% BSA, were added at 50 μl/precoated well. After 1 h at room temperature, the plates were washed four times with PBST. Each well was then incubated for 1 h with 50 μl of a 1:10 dilution of culture supernatant containing soluble scFv or phage clones (∼109 phages/well). After washing four times with PBST, each well was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-E tag (for scFv) or anti-M13 (for phages) antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature. Assays were developed with tetramethylbenzidine/H2O2 substrate (Pierce). After 15 min of incubation in the dark, the reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 1 n sulfic acid, and the absorbance was read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. Flow Cytometry—Phage were prepared from single colonies of E. coli TG1 containing phagemids selected after panning. Flow cytometry was carried out as follows: 5 × 105 Daudi cells were incubated with 1 × 1012 phage or scFv (∼10 μg/ml) at room temperature for 60 min; cells were washed two times with blocking buffer containing 5% BSA plus 0.1% NaN3 in PBS, and 5 μg of mouse anti-M13 antibody or anti E-Tag antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each sample. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then washed twice with blocking buffer. A goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was added, and cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed two times, and analysis was performed in a FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences). Data were acquired using Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Construction and Expression of Immunotoxin—scFv from selected phagemids were PCR-amplified using primers that introduced NdeI and HindIII restrictions sites. The products of the reaction were purified, digested with NdeI and HindIII, and cloned into a T7 expression vector in which the scFv was fused to a truncated version of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38). The expression and purification of recombinant immunotoxins was performed as described previously (26Beers R. Chowdhury P. Bigner D. Pastan I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2835-2843PubMed Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity Assays—Cytotoxicity on cell lines was measured by both protein synthesis inhibition and cell death assays. In both assays, cells were plated in 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/100 μl/well. Immunotoxins were serially diluted in PBS, 0.2% human serum albumin, and 20 μl of the resulting mixture was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C. Protein synthesis was measured by [3H]leucine incorporation. The cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well [3H]leucine in 20 μl of PBS, 0.2% human serum albumin for 2.5 h at 37 °C. Radiolabeled material was captured on filter mats and counted in a Betaplate scintillation counter (Amersham Biosciences). Triplicate sample values were averaged, and the inhibition of protein synthesis was determined by calculating percentage of incorporation compared with control wells without added toxin. The activity of the molecule is defined by IC50, i.e. the toxin concentration that reduced incorporation of radioactivity by 50% compared with the cells that were not treated with the toxin. All experiments were performed in triplicate on three separate occasions. Cell death was assessed by WST-8 conversion using the Cell Counting Kit-8 according to recommendations from the supplier (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). A volume of 10 μl of WST-8 (5 mm WST-8, 0.2 mm 1-methoxy-5-methylphenazinium methylsulfate, and 150 mm NaCl) was added to each well, and the incubation was carried out for 4 h at 37 °C. The absorbance of the sample at 450 nm was measured with a reference wavelength of 650 nm. Cytotoxicity was expressed as 50% inhibition of cell viability, which is halfway between the level of viability in the absence of toxin and that in the presence of 10 μg/ml of cycloheximide. All experiments were performed in triplicate on two or three separate occasions. Statistical analyses were performed with Prism (version 3.02) for Windows (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA). Within each cell line, raw data were analyzed by application of one factor (treatment) repeated measures analysis of variance with Dunnett's and Student-Newman-Keuls post-tests. The confidence interval was set at 95% for all statistical tests. p values less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Determination of Affinity Constants (KD)—Affinity measurements were performed with flow cytometry following the protocols described previously (30Benedict C.A. MacKrell A.J. Anderson W.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 201: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Krauss J. Arndt M.A. Martin A.C. Liu H. Rybak S.M. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) except that in this study Daudi cells and monomeric immunotoxins instead of the whole antibody or scFv molecules were used. Equilibrium constants and Scatchard plots (32Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar) were determined by using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for nonlinear regression with the Prism software (version 3.0.2, GraphPad software). Sequencing Analysis—The scFv fragments present in selected phage clones were sequenced using the dideoxy method with primers S1 and AMBN. DNA sequencing was performed using PE Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit. The samples were run and analyzed on a PE Applied Biosystem model 310 automated sequencer (NCI DNA Sequencing Core Facility, Bethesda). Both the heavy and light chains variable region sequences were numbered following the Kabat rule (33Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. National Institutes of Health Publication 91-3242, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar). The scFv sequences were analyzed by online V-Quest software provided by the International ImMunoGeneTics data base (IMGT, imgt.cines.fr/textes/vquest/) for identification of germline origin of VH/VL regions (34Lefranc M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Structural Modeling of V Regions—The structural models of the variable region of RFB4 and its germline counterpart were generated by molecular modeling using web-based antibody modeling software WAM (35Whitelegg N.R. Rees A.R. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (antibody.bath.ac.uk/index.html), which uses a modified form of the algorithm used in antibody modeling software AbM of Oxford Molecular (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). In this study, we used the dead end elimination algorithm for side chain building and VFF screen for final screening. Molecular models were viewed and analyzed using VMD (www.ks.uiuc.edu/) and SwissPdb Viewer (www.expasy.org/spdbv/). Sequence Analysis of the RFB4 Antibody and Identification of DNA Hot Spots for in Vitro Affinity Maturation—High affinity antibodies were generated in mice and humans by somatic hypermutation. Somatic hypermutation does not occur randomly within immunoglobulin V genes but is preferentially targeted to certain nucleotide positions (hot spots) and away from others (cold spots) (23Jolly C.J. Wagner S.D. Rada C. Klix N. Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Semin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Rada C. Ehrenstein M.R. Neuberger M.S. Milstein C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 135-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Cold spots often coincide with residues essential for V gene folding. Hot spots, which appear to be strategically located to favor affinity maturation, are most frequently located in the CDRs (particularly CDR1). This process mainly results in the introduction of mutations that are located at or very near (A/G)G(C/T)(A/T) (RGYW) and AG(C/T) (AGY) sequences. A total of 50-60% of all somatic hypermutations are found around RGYW motifs (24Neuberger M.S. Ehrenstein M.R. Klix N. Jolly C.J. Yelamos J. Rada C. Milstein C. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 162: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To improve the affinity of the antibody portion of recombinant immunotoxins and thereby increase their cytotoxic activity, we have proposed that hot spots are the preferred regions to target new mutations (21Chowdhury P.S. Pastan I. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The first step in this process is to identify the DNA hot spot sequences in all the CDRs of the antibody under investigation. A homology search using V-Quest at IMGT (imgt.cines.fr/textes/vquest/) (34Lefranc M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) shows that the light chain variable region of antibody RFB4 used to make immunotoxin BL22 is of the Vκ10 class and has 96% identity at the amino acid level with the germline light chain IGKV10-96*01 (GenBank™ accession number M15520). The light chain variable region gene probably originated from recombination of the Vκ gene (IGKV10-96*01) and the Jκ1 gene IGKJ1*01 (GenBank™ accession number V00777) without a somatic insertion. The DNA sequence of the germline V and J gene fragments were manually assembled and translated into an amino acid sequence. Fig. 1 showed alignment of the germline sequence with the amino acid sequence of the RFB4 VL region. The heavy chain variable region of RFB4 was found to be of highest homology with the germline VH gene IGHV5S21*01 (GenBank™ accession number AF120463). It has 94% amino acid identity with this germline sequence. The C-terminal region probably originated from recombination of the germline D gene IGHD-FL16.1*01 (GenBank™ accession number J00434) and J gene IGHJ3*01 (GenBank™ accession number V00770) with an insertion resulting in one additional amino acid at the 5′-end and three amino acids at the 3′-end of the D gene. The germline V, D, and J gene fragments were manually assembled, converted into the amino acid sequence, and aligned with the RFB4 VH region (Fig. 1). We identified two types of hot spot residues in the nucleotide sequences of the CDR domains of RFB4. One type contains hot spots in germline residues; the other type contains hot spots in residues that have already undergone mutational events. Germline hot spot residues have the same nucleotide sequence as the germline gene, whereas in non-germline hot spot residues the nucleotide sequence at or very near the RGYW motifs differs from the germline gene. The non-germline hot spots were presumably produced during somatic hypermutation of B cells. Five germline hot spot clusters (Fig. 1, red) were identified in"
https://openalex.org/W2048435508,"We previously demonstrated that protein kinase C-eta (PKC-eta) mediates a phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced proliferative response in human glioblastoma (GBM) cells. In this report, we show that PMA-stimulated activation of PKC-eta in U-251 GBM cells resulted in activation of both Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways and an increase in cell proliferation. Expression of a kinase dead PKC-eta (PKC-etaKR) construct reduced the basal and PMA-evoked proliferation of PKC-eta-expressing U-251 GBM cells, as well as abrogated the PMA-induced activation of Akt, mTOR, and the mTOR targets 4E-BP1 and STAT-3. Treatment of cells with the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10 muM) or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (10 nM) also reduced PMA-induced proliferation and cell-cycle progression. Expression of a constitutively active PKC-eta (PKC-etaDeltaNPS) construct in a GBM cell line with no endogenous PKC-eta (U-1242) also provided evidence that PKC-eta targets the Akt and mTOR signaling pathways. Moreover, activation of 4E-BP1 and STAT-3 in both PMA-treated U-251 and PKC-etaDeltaNPS-expressing U-1242 GBM cells was inhibited by rapamycin. However, activation of Akt, but not mTOR was inhibited by the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002. This study identifies Akt and mTOR as downstream targets of PKC-eta that are involved in GBM cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2025968524,"The gene encoding family 8 glycoside hydrolases from Bacillus halodurans C-125 (BH2105), an alkalophilic bacterium with a known genomic sequence, was expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein was expressed with the intact N-terminal sequence, suggesting that it did not possess a signal peptide and that it was an intracellular enzyme. The recombinant enzyme showed no hydrolytic activity on xylan, whereas it had been annotated as xylanase Y. It hydrolyzed xylooligosaccharide whose degree of polymerization is greater than or equal to 3 in an exo-splitting manner with anomeric inversion, releasing the xylose unit at the reducing end. Judging from its substrate specificity and reaction mechanism, we named the enzyme reducing end xylose-releasing exo-oligoxylanase (Rex). Rex was found to utilize only the β-anomer of the substrate to form β-xylose and α-xylooligosaccharide. The optimum pH of the enzymatic reaction (6.2–7.3) was found in the neutral range, a range beneficial for intracellular enzymes. The genomic sequence suggests that B. halodurans secretes two endoxylanases and possesses two α-arabinofuranosidases, one α-glucuronidase, and three β-xylosidases intracellularly in addition to Rex.

Although GH10 and GH11 xylanases have different three-dimensional structures, both of these enzymes can produce xylooligosaccharides from xylan in an endo-splitting manner with anomeric retention. Recently a GH8 endo-β-1,4-xylanase was found in a culture supernatant of Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis and characterized (18Collins T. Meuwis M.A. Stals I. Claeyssens M. Feller G. Gerday C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35133-35139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although the GH8 xylanase also hydrolyzes the β-1,4 glycosidic bond of xylan in an endo-splitting manner, its reaction proceeds with anomeric inversion. The GH8 family contains various endoglycoside hydrolases, such as chitosanase (EC 3.2.1.132), endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4), and licheninase (EC 3.2.1.73) as well as endo-β-1,4-xylanase. These enzymes also hydrolyze corresponding polysaccharides with anomeric inversion. The three-dimensional structures of two GH8 enzymes, the endo-β-1,4-xylanase from P. haloplanktis and an endoglucanase from Clostridium thermocellum, were found to have an (α/α)6 barrel structure (clan GH-M) (6Guerin D.M.

Kudo T. Horikoshi K. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 784-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) whose genomic sequence is available (21Takami H. Nakasone K. Takaki Y. Maeno G. Sasaki R. Masui N. Fuji F.

According to the annotation of the genomic sequence, the alkalophilic microbe supposedly possesses three endo-β-1,4-xylanases (GH8, GH10, and GH11). Enzymatic characterizations of two secreted xylanases, XynA (BH2120, GH10) and XynN (probably BH0899, GH11), indicate that XynA exhibits a broad optimal pH range for activity (pH 4–10), whereas XynN (pH 4–6) is active only at neutral acidity (20Honda H.

Thus, we expressed the BH2105 protein in Escherichia coli and characterized the properties of the enzyme. In this study, we found that the BH2105 protein was not an endo-β-1,4-xylanase but has a novel activity of hydrolyzing xylooligosaccharides, releasing xylose from their reducing ends. This result prompted us to characterize the unique enzymatic properties (substrate specificity and reaction mechanism) in detail. Here we describe the characterization of the newly found enzyme named reducing end xylose-releasing exooligoxylanase (Rex). Materials—The B. halodurans C-125 (9153) strain was obtained from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms (Wako, Japan). Restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and the DNA polymerase from Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 was obtained from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). Birch wood xylan was prepared by lyophilizing the water-soluble fraction of birch wood xylan (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) as described previously (23Dupont C. Roberge M. Shareck F. Morosoli R.

Xylooligosaccharides (Xn where n = degree of polymerization) were purchased from Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland). p-Nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (X-pNP) was purchased from Sigma. p-Nitrophenyl-β-d-xylobioside was prepared as described previously (24Kitaoka M.

Res. 2003; 338: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 1,5-Anhydroxylotriitol (1-deoxy-xylotriose, X3-de) was synthesized by reducing acetobromoxylotriose, prepared by acetylation and bromination of X3 with pyridine-acetic anhydride and TiBr4, respectively, followed by reduction with lithium aluminum hydride as described for 1,5-anhydro-d-glucitol (26Reither F.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1945; 67: 1056-1057Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 27Fletcher Jr., H.G. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1963; : 197-198Google Scholar). Other reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained commercially. DNA Manipulation—Recombinant DNA techniques and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep Spin Plasmid kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Digestion by restriction enzymes was carried out in the appropriate buffer at concentrations of 1–10 units/μg of DNA for 0.5–16 h at 37 °C. Completion of the reaction was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. A QIAEX Agarose Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) was used for the extraction and purification of DNA from agarose gels. Nucleotide Sequence Analysis—The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using an automated DNA sequencer (Model 310A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with a dRhodamine Terminator kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). At least three independent clones of each PCR product were sequenced. Sequence data were analyzed using GENETYX MAC software Version 11.0 (GENETYX Software Development Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Expression of BH2105 in E. coli—The gene encoding BH2105 was amplified from the genomic DNA of B. halodurans C-125 by the polymerase chain reaction using the forward primer 5′-CCT TCC ATG GAG AAA ACG ACA GAA GGT GCA TTT-3′ (containing an NcoI site, denoted by bold type) and the reverse primer 5′-GAA CTC GAG GTG TTC CTC TCT TGG CCC TCA G-3′ (containing an XhoI site, denoted by bold type). Because of the addition of the NcoI site, the second amino acid residue coded was changed into Glu from Lys. The amplified fragment was digested by the corresponding restriction enzymes. The digested fragment was ligated into pET28b (Novagen, Madison, WI) at the corresponding sites, generating the plasmid pET28b-BH2105 encoding the BH2105 protein with the His6 sequence added to its C-terminal end. Next pET28b-BH2105 was electroporated into E. coli BL21(GOLD)(DE3) cells, and positive colonies were selected. Resulting transformants were incubated in Luria broth (100 ml) containing 0.05 mg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until the optical density, at 600 nm, reached a level of 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to give a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were incubated for 24 h at 25 °C. The BH2105 protein expressed was extracted from the wet cells (1 g) in 5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) using a sonicator (Model 250D sonifier, Branson, Danbury, CT). Purification of Recombinant BH2105—The cell-free extract was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column (1 × 3 cm), and the enzyme was eluted with a stepwise gradient of imidazole (1, 10 mm; 2, 20 mm; 3, 250 mm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.3 m NaCl. The fraction containing the BH2105 protein was desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Next the protein solution was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (2.5 × 4 cm), and the enzyme was eluted with a stepwise gradient of NaCl (1, 0.05 m; 2, 0.2 m; 3, 0.3 m) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The appropriate fractions were collected, and purity was checked by SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). A 10-kDa protein ladder (Invitrogen) was used as a standard molecular marker for SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm based on the theoretical molar absorption coefficients (106,210 m–1cm–1) determined from the amino acid composition of BH2105 (30Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified recombinant BH2105 protein was determined using a G1000A protein sequencer (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Enzyme Assay—The enzyme activity was routinely determined by measuring the increase in xylose during the hydrolysis of X3. The enzymatic reaction was carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) containing various concentrations of X3 at 40 °C. Periodically a portion of the reaction mixture was boiled for 5 min to inactivate the enzyme, and the concentration of xylooligosaccharides (X1-X6) was quantified by high performance ion exchange chromatography on a CARBOPAC PA1 column (4 × 250 mm, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with a pulsed amperometric detector (DX-3, Dionex). Chromatography was performed with a linear gradient of 0–0.2 m sodium acetate in 0.1 m NaOH for 20 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Effect of pH and Temperature on Enzymatic Activity—Enzymatic activity was measured under standard conditions of X3 (0.5 mm) hydrolysis, while pH of the reaction mixture was changed with each 50 mm buffer. The pH stability was determined by incubating the enzyme at 30 °C for 30 min at each pH followed by measuring activity under standard conditions. The buffer systems used were sodium acetate (pH 3.5–5.5) and sodium phosphate (pH 6.0–8.0), TAPS (pH 8.0–9.0), and CAPS (pH 9.7–11.0). The final pH values of the reaction solution were determined after addition of the enzyme and the substrates. The optimum temperature of activity was measured for 10 min under standard conditions except for temperature. The thermostability was determined by incubating the enzyme at each temperature for 30 min in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) followed by measuring the activity under the standard conditions at 40 °C. Analysis of the Products—The reaction products from various substrates were separated by TLC on a silica gel 60 F254 plate (5.0 × 7.5 cm, Merck) with a solvent system of acetonitrile:water (4:1, v/v). Sugars were detected by baking after dipping the plate in 5% sulfuric acid in methanol. When necessary, the amounts of the products were quantified by using high performance ion exchange chromatography as described above. The amounts of reducing sugar liberated in the hydrolysis of polysaccharides by the enzyme were determined using the γ 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method (31Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22353) Google Scholar) or the copper-bicinchoninic acid method (32Waffenschmidt S. Jaenicke L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Anomeric Form of the Products—The anomeric form of the hydrolytic product from X3 and X4 (50 mm) was determined by using an isocratic HPLC method (33Koga D. Yoshioka T. Arakane Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 1643-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) described below. The enzymatic reaction was carried out in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) at 25 °C with an enzyme concentration of 5.5 μm. After incubation for 1 and 25 min, an aliquot (10 μl) of the reaction solution was immediately loaded onto a TSK-GEL Amide-80 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Tosoh, Japan), and eluted with acetonitrile:water (7:3, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min at 25 °C, separating the xylooligosaccharides anomers. The initial substrate and products were detected using a refractive index monitor (RI Model 504, GL Science, Tokyo, Japan). The retention times of α- and β-xylose were confirmed by loading a solution of α-xylopyranose immediately after preparation, while the retention times of anomers of xylobiose were confirmed by loading the products of 1 and 25 min hydrolyzes of phenyl-β-xylobioside by Cex (34Honda Y. Kitaoka M. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. Hayashi K. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2002; 93: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), a family 10 xylanase that forms β-xylobiose as its initial product. In addition, the retention times of xylooligosaccharides were evaluated by the proportion of the equilibrated anomers (α:β = ∼4:6) using an equilibrated solution of xylooligosaccharides. For all xylooligosaccharides, the α-anomers had shorter retention times than the corresponding β-anomers. Kinetic Analysis—To determine the apparent kinetic parameters, X3–X6 were subjected to hydrolysis in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) at 40 °C. The initial rates were measured as the increase in xylose by using high performance ion exchange chromatography as described above. The kinetic parameters were calculated by regressing the experimental data (substrate concentration range; 0.2 × Km–3 × Km) with the Michaelis-Menten equation by the curve fit method using Kaleidagraph™ Version 3.51 (Synergy Software). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis for E70A, D128A, D263A, and D128A/D263A was performed using the PCR overlap extension method (35Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). The following mutagenetic oligonucleotide primers were used (the mismatched bases are underlined): 5′-CTC GAT GTG CGG ACT GCA GGA ATG TCC TAC-3′ (E70A), 5′-GCC CCA GCT CCG GCC GGA GAG GAA TAT TTT-3′ (D128A), and 5′-CAC TTT TTT AGC GCT TCT TAT CGT GTG GCT-3′ (D263A). The mutated enzymes were prepared and purified as described above. Characterization of Recombinant BH2105—The recombinant BH2105 protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(GOLD) and purified to yield a 45-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE. The enzyme was purified 2.7-fold from the cell-free extract. The N-terminal sequence of the purified protein was Met-Glu-Lys-Thr-Thr-Glu-Gly-Ala-Phe-Tyr, corresponding to the deduced amino acid sequence from the starting codon. This sequence information suggested that the enzyme has no signal peptide. This enzyme did not hydrolyze birch wood xylan even at high concentrations (10 mg/ml) as shown by measuring the increase in reducing value, clearly indicating that it is not an endo-β-1,4-xylanase even though it was annotated as xylanase Y. Furthermore the enzyme did not hydrolyze any other polymeric substrates for GH8 enzymes (chitosan, lichenan, curdlan, and carboxymethylcellulose) determined by increases in reducing value. Various pentasaccharides (xylopentaose, cellopentaose, laminaripentaose, chitopentaose, and chitosanpentaose) were examined for the substrate, and the enzyme showed hydrolytic activity only on xylopentaose, producing initially X1 and X4 and finally X1 and X2. To obtain further information on the hydrolysis of xylooligosaccharides (Xn where n = 2–6), the products were analyzed by TLC. In the initial stage, the enzyme released X1 and X(n–1) from Xn, and the final products were X1 and X2 when n ≥ 3. It hydrolyzed X2 into X1 at a much slower rate than that of X3 (less than 0.01% rate). On the other hand, the enzyme exhibited no activity on X-pNP and X2-pNP even at extended incubation time, suggesting the possibility of hydrolysis at the reducing end. Oligosaccharides larger than the initial substrates in the enzymatic reaction were not detected, indicating that the enzyme had no transglycosidation activity. Enzymatic properties as a function of pH and temperature were determined with the X3 hydrolysis (Fig. 1). The optimum pH for activity was between 6.2 and 7.3, and the enzyme was completely stable between pH 5.0 and 9.8 at 30 °C for 30 min. The enzyme was stable at temperatures up to 40 °C, and the optimal temperature was 50 °C. Substrate Specificity: Recognition of Sugar Residue—To determine the position of hydrolysis and further substrate specificity of the enzyme, various derivatives of X3 were examined. When β-(1→4) d-glucose and d-xylose-based trisaccharides (G-X-X, X-X-G, G-X-G, X-G-G, G-G-X, X-G-X, and G3) were examined as the substrate, the enzyme hydrolyzed only G-X-X, X-X-G, and G-X-G at the linkage of the reducing end side, judging from the products, with a much slower rate than X3 (Table I). The reducing end specificity is completely different from that of β-xylosidase, which liberates xylose from the non-reducing end. The substitution of the middle xylose unit into glucose caused complete loss of activity, indicating that the sugar moiety located at the –1 subsite (Fig. 2) must strictly be xylose. Substitution at the reducing end and the non-reducing end caused drastic decreases in activity, indicating that both the +1 and –2 subsites (Fig. 2) strongly prefer xylose but were not as strict as the subsite –1. Judging from the specificity, the enzyme is very specific to homo-xylooligosaccharides. It hydrolyzed X3-de into X2 and 1,5-anhydroxylitol (X-de) at a rate that was 3.2% of the hydrolysis of X3 (Table I). This result again confirms that the enzyme hydrolyzes the reducing end glycosyl linkage. The result also suggests that the enzyme recognizes one of the anomeric hydroxyl groups at the reducing end. The small hydrolysis rates for the derivatives of xylotriose were due to their higher Km values evidenced by their linear S-ν relations in the range lower than 2.6 mm, whereas Km for X3 was 2.4 mm.Table IActivity of BH2105 toward various trisaccharidesSubstrateProductSpecific activitys-1X-X-X (X3)X-X + X84.0 (100%)X-X-X-de (X3-de)X-X + X-de2.7 (3.2%)G-X-XG-X + X0.94 (1.1%)X-X-GX-X + G0.42 (0.5%)G-X-GG-X + G0.003 (0.004%)X-G-G—a—, not detectable.G-G-X—X-G-X—G-G-G (G3)—a —, not detectable. Open table in a new tab Anomeric Hydroxyl Group Recognition by the Enzyme—The anomeric composition of the degradation products of X3 and X4 by the BH2105 protein were analyzed by HPLC. Fig. 3 shows the HPLC profiles of the hydrolytic products from X3 and X4 obtained with the enzymes. The standard equilibrium ratio of α:β anomers for X3 and X4 were ∼4:6 (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3A, the enzyme produced β-anomer of X1 and α-anomer of X2 from X3 in the reaction for 1 min. Furthermore the α-anomer of X3 was the predominant anomer remaining in the reaction. Small amounts of α-X1 and β-X2 were also observed, which may have been due to the mutarotation of the initial products over the short term. This result strongly suggests that the enzyme hydrolyzed only the β-anomer of X3 at the linkage of the reducing end side with anomeric inversion to form α-X2 and β-X1. The preference of the β-anomer explains the reason why the enzyme hydrolyzed X3-de at a much slower rate. After 25 min of the reaction, the substrate (X3) disappeared, and the anomeric composition of the product (X and X2) reached equilibrium. This result suggests that the enzyme hydrolyzed α-X3 after the mutarotation that converted α-X3 into β-X3. In the case of X4 hydrolytic reaction after 1 min, β-X1 and α-X3 were produced with a decrease in β-X4 (Fig. 3B). Again small amounts of the opposite anomers were also observed that were probably due to mutarotation. It should be noted that X2, the hydrolytic product of X3, was hardly detected even though half of X4 had already been hydrolyzed in the reaction, suggesting that the enzyme did not act on the α-anomer. The α-X4 remaining and the α-X3 produced must be converted into their β-anomers before the hydrolysis. After 25 min of reaction, the products were equilibrated X1 and X2. The hydrolytic mechanism is schematically summarized in Fig. 4. Kinetic Property—The S-ν curve of X3–X6 hydrolysis by the enzyme indicates a typical Michaelis-Menten type relationship. The kinetic parameters are summarized in Table II. The Km value increased with the increase in degree of polymerization, while kcat/Km decreased with the increase in Km. These results suggest that X3 is the most suitable substrate for the enzyme and that the role of the enzyme is to hydrolyze smaller xylooligosaccharides. Subsites downstream of subsite –2 (Fig. 2) may be postulated, but such subsites must have negative binding energies.Table IIKinetic parameters of xylooligosaccharides hydrolysis catalyzed by BH2105Substratek catKmkcat/Kms-1mms-1 mm-1X3163 ± 52.4 ± 0.266.9 ± 3.5X4162 ± 65.0 ± 0.432.3 ± 1.4X573 ± 24.4 ± 0.316.7 ± 0.5X6175 ± 1918.5 ± 1.318.5 ± 1.3 Open table in a new tab Mutational Analysis—The BH2105 amino acid sequence analysis indicated a 32.6% identity with P. haloplanktis GH8 xylanase (GenBank™ accession number AJ427291). As found in the sequence alignment between these enzymes, the catalytic residues (Glu-70, Asp-128, and Asp-263; BH2105 numbering) proposed for the xylanase were strongly conserved in the BH2105 amino acid sequence (19Van Petegem F.

Therefore, we examined the enzymatic activity of alanine mutants (E70A, D123A, and D263A) and found that, as expected, the hydrolytic activity of E70A and D263A was 10–4 orders less than that of wild type (Table III). On the other hand, D128A retained slightly higher activity than that of E70A and D263A, although it was still approximately three hundredths of wild type (Table III). The residues were predicted to act as an acid catalyst (Glu-70) and a base catalyst (Asp-263) and to stabilize the 2,5B conformation of the sugar moiety bound at subsite –1 (Asp-123) (6Guerin D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2094436430,"In order to identify tumor suppressive genes silenced by CpG methylation in prostate carcinoma (PCa), we determined genome-wide expression changes after pharmacological reversal of CpG methylation-mediated transcriptional repression in three PCa cell lines using microarray analysis. Thereby, epigenetic silencing of the 14-3-3sigma gene was detected in the cell line LNCaP. 14-3-3sigma encodes a p53-regulated inhibitor of cell cycle progression. Laser microdissection was used to isolate different cell types present in diseased prostatic tissue. Subsequent methylation-specific PCR analysis showed CpG methylation of 14-3-3sigma in all 41 primary PCa samples analysed, which was accompanied by a decrease or loss of 14-3-3sigma protein expression. In contrast, normal prostate epithelial and benign prostate hyperplasia cells showed high levels of 14-3-3sigma expression. PCa-precursor lesions (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) also displayed decreased levels of 14-3-3sigma expression in luminal cells, which are known to contain shortened telomeres. RNA interference-mediated inactivation of 14-3-3sigma compromised a DNA damage-induced G(2)/M arrest in the PCa cell line PC3. The generality of CpG methylation and downregulation of 14-3-3sigma expression in PCa suggests that it significantly contributes to the formation of PCa, potentially by allowing the escape from a DNA damage-induced arrest elicited by telomere shortening."
https://openalex.org/W2133396714,"The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) have been the subject of many studies to identify signaling pathways that promote cell survival or death. In cultured cardiac myocytes, p38 MAPK promotes cell survival or death depending on whether it is activated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 (MKK6) or MKK3, respectively. The objectives of the current study were to examine the effects of MKK6-mediated p38 activation in the heart in vivo. Accordingly, we generated transgenic (TG) mice that overexpress wild type MKK6 in a cardiac-restricted manner. Although p38 was about 17-fold more active in TG than non-transgenic (NTG) mouse hearts, TG mouse hearts were morphologically and functionally similar to those of NTG littermates. However, upon transient ischemia followed by reperfusion, the MKK6 TG mouse hearts exhibited significantly better functional recovery and less injury than NTG mouse hearts. Because MKK6 increases levels of the protective small heat shock protein, αB-crystallin (αBC), in cultured cardiac myocytes, we examined αBC levels in the mouse hearts. The level of αBC was 2-fold higher in MKK6 TG than NTG mouse hearts. Moreover, ischemia followed by reperfusion induced a 6.4-fold increase in αBC levels in the mitochondrial fractions of TG mouse hearts but no increase in αBC levels in any of the other fractions analyzed.

Because of their potential to serve as targets for the development of therapies aimed at reducing the effects of stress on myocardial damage, the mitogen-activated protein kinases have been the focus of many recent studies. Although all three members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family are activated during most myocardial stresses, the roles played by each remain unclear. For example, there is strong evidence supporting both protective and damaging roles for p38 in the stressed myocardium. Several recent reviews have described this controversy (4Liang Q.

In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, overexpression of MKK6, an upstream activator of both the major and minor p38 isoforms in the heart, p38α and -β, respectively, was found to be protective (10Zechner D.

Moreover, dominant-negative forms of p38 or the pharmacological p38 inhibitor SB203580 blocked the protective effects of MKK6 (11Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A.

These results suggested that p38 can be protective or damaging, depending on the mechanism of activation and the relative levels of p38 isoform activation.The isolated perfused heart model has also been used to study roles for p38 in preconditioning and/or mediating the damage observed during I/R. Many of these studies demonstrated that p38 is activated during ischemia and/or reperfusion (14Marais E. Genade S. Huisamen B. Strijdom J.G. Moolman J.A. Lochner A. J. Mol. Cell.

In some reports the inhibition of p38 with SB203580 or SB202190 increased cell survival and improved functional recovery (16Sato M. Cordis G.A. Maulik N. Das D.K. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: 901-907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, others have shown that inhibiting p38 had either no effect or actually increased ischemic damage and reduced functional recovery (17Mocanu M.M. Baxter G.F. Yue Y. Critz S.D. Yellon D.M. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2000; 95: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although there has been speculation on the reasons for these seemingly paradoxical results (8Ping P. Murphy E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 921-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), in the isolated perfused heart I/R model it remains unclear whether p38 damages or protects.Several recent studies have used transgenesis or targeted gene disruption to study the function of p38 in the mouse heart in vivo. For example, although complete disruption of p38α in the heart is lethal (18Adams R.H. Porras A. Alonso G. Jones M. Vintersten K. Panelli S. Valladares A. Perez L. Klein R. Nebreda A.R. Mol.

In another study, overexpression of constitutively active MKK3 or MKK6 in mouse hearts resulted in cardiac abnormality but did not cause increased myocyte apoptosis (22Liao P. Georgakopoulos D. Kovacs A. Zheng M. Lerner D. Pu H. Saffitz J. Chien K. Xiao R.P. Kass D.A. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12283-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Finally, the hearts of mice expressing dominant-negative MKK6 or dominant-negative p38α exhibited reduced damage from I/R in an in vivo model of myocardial infarction (23Kaiser R.A. Bueno O.F.

We found that p38 was activated by about 17-fold in the MKK6 TG mouse hearts, and ventricular morphology and function were similar to non-transgenic (NTG) mouse hearts. However, when exposed to I/R, the MKK6 TG mouse hearts exhibited significantly less tissue damage and functional deficit than the NTG mouse hearts. Combined with findings in other studies, these results suggest that in the heart p38 can either protect or damage; however, the mechanisms underlying these opposing effects are yet to be determinedMATERIALS AND METHODSAnimal StudiesApproximately 200 adult mice (Mus musculus) 6-8 months of age were used in this study. All procedures involving animals were in accordance with institutional guidelines.Preparation of Transgenic Mice—PCR products of FLAG-human-MKK6 cDNA and FLAG-human-MKK6(Glu) cDNA (R. Davis, University of Massachusetts) with 5′ NotI and 3′ KpnI sites were inserted into the αMHC vector (J. Robbins, University of Cincinnati). The αMHC-MKK6 constructs were linearized by Nru1 digestion. After introduction of the constructs by routine intranuclear injection, transgenic mice were maintained as heterozygotes in a C3H background. All experimental animals were F3 generation or later and were 5-10 months of age. MKK6(wt) and MKK6(Glu) TG mice have been observed for up to 2 years, and compared with NTG, both lines exhibit no difference in life span or any other overt phenotypic characteristic. The biochemical, histological, and physiological results obtained with the MKK6(wt) and MKK6(Glu) mice were essentially the same. Accordingly, this study reports the results from the MKK6(wt) line only.Genotyping—DNA derived from tail biopsies was used as the template for PCR-based genotyping using the following primers. FLAG-MKK6 primers were GACTATAAGGACGATGATGACAAATCTCAG (5′ primer) and CTAGTGATGTATCCATGAGCTCCATGCAG (3′ primer). β-Globin primers were CCAATCTGCTCACACAGGATAGAGAGGGCAGG (5′ primer) and CCTTGAGGCTGTCCAAGTGATTCAGGCCATCG (3′ primer).Molecular CharacterizationCardiac Extracts—For most analyses, mouse hearts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then pulverized and sonicated in tissue lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1% Triton X-100). When p38 levels were to be assessed, the Triton X-100 in the lysis buffer was replaced with 0.5% SDS, which we found to be required for solubilization of p38β. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads for 20 min at 4 °C. The total protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, catalog #500-0112).Cardiac Fractionation—Mouse hearts were homogenized and fractionated into cytosolic, mitochondrial, nuclear, and myofibrillar fractions by differential centrifugation, as previously described (25Baines C.P. Zhang J. Wang G.W. Zheng Y.T. Xiu J.X. Cardwell E.M. Bolli R. Ping P. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 26Mizukami Y. Yoshida K. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Molecular markers of cytosolic, mitochondrial, nuclear, and myofibrillar fractions, i.e. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase IV (COX IV), c-Jun, and α-actinin, respectively, were used to validate the effectiveness of the fractionation procedure. The putative cytosolic, mitochondrial, nuclear, and myofibrillar fractions contained 93, 22, 66, and 89% of the relevant markers for these fractions (see Table I). The myofibrillar fraction, which was not used further in this study, although enriched in α-actinin as expected, also contained some COX IV, suggesting mitochondrial association with this fraction. The reason for this is not known; however, the putative mitochondrial fraction contained almost all of the remaining COX IV and very little of the other marker proteins. Accordingly, we considered the cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear fractions to be enriched for proteins localized to those cellular compartments. αB-crystallin levels were assessed in each fraction as part of our study of the change in concentration of this small HSP in the mitochondrial fraction after I/R stress.Table ICardiac tissue fractionationFraction% of total protein or markerProteinGAPDHCOX IVc-Junα-ActininαBCCytosol35.692.70.9138.339.7Mitochondrial7.11.122.2111.23.1Nuclear15.12.80.9661.26.4Myofibrillar42.23.476.01089.350.8 Open table in a new tab Western Analyses—Unless otherwise stated, SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses were carried out with 50-100 μg of tissue protein using standard methods.Antibodies and Antisera—Immunological reagents used to detect the following proteins were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA: ERK (#9102), phospho-ERK (#9101), JNK (#9252), phospho-JNK (#9251), p38α (#9218), phospho-p38 (#9211), phospho-MKK6 antiserum (#92315).

Functional recovery was expressed as a percentage of pre-ischemic left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP).Myocardial Infarctions—In vivo coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion was carried out essentially as previously described (30Guo Y.

Myocardial infarction was produced in NTG and MKK6(wt) mice by a 30-min coronary occlusion followed by 24 h of reperfusion. At the conclusion of the study, the occluded/reperfused vascular bed and the infarct were identified by postmortem perfusion of the heart with triphenyltetrazolium chloride and phthalo blue dye. Infarct size was calculated by using computerized videoplanimetry.DNA Fragmentation—DNA fragmentation was carried out as previously described (29Morrison L.E. Whittaker R.J. Klepper R.E.

The relationship between infarct size and risk region size was compared among groups using an ANOVA. Phospho- and total mitogen-activated protein kinase data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t test.RESULTSMolecular Characterization—Immunoblotting and pull-down kinase assays showed that kinase-active FLAG-MKK6 was expressed in the ventricles of the MKK6(wt) mice but not NTG littermates (Fig. 1, A and B). FLAG-MKK6 was not found in TG mouse livers or brains (data not shown). Immunoblotting demonstrated increased levels of phosphorylated MKK3/6 3The phospho-specific antiserum used for these experiments does not distinguish between MKK3 and MKK6; however, the total antiserum is MKK6-specific. and total MKK6 in the TG mice (Fig. 1C).Fig. 1Characterization of FLAG-MKK6 expression and activity in MKK6 transgenic mice. Cardiac extracts from 6-8-month-old NTG or MKK6 TG mice were assessed for FLAG-MKK6 expression (for the FLAG blot 100 and 20 μg of protein from the NTG and TG mouse heart extracts, respectively, were fractionated by SDS-PAGE) (panel A), FLAG-IP kinase activity (panel B), phosphorylated MKK6 (panel C, top), and total MKK6 (panel C, bottom), as described under “Materials and Methods.” Arrows indicate the migration positions of FLAG-MKK6, glutathione S-transferase-p38β(K53R), endogenous phospho-MKK3/6, and endogenous MKK3/6.

Using isoform-specific antisera (Fig 2A), the relative levels of p38α and -β were determined in various mouse tissues. As expected, more p38β than -α was detected in mouse brain extracts, whereas less p38β was detected in skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, and heart (Fig. 2B). 4Densitometric analyses indicated that p38α is about 4-5-fold more abundant than p38β in the mouse heart.

Aliquots of 100 μg of protein were loaded into each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The activities of p38α and p38β were determined by phospho-p38 immunoblotting. However, because the phospho-specific antiserum cannot distinguish between p38α and p38β, which co-migrate on SDS-PAGE, mouse heart tissue was fractionated (see “Materials and Methods” and Table I) to evaluate whether these two p38 isoforms could be separated into different subcellular fractions. Most of the p38α was localized to the cytosolic fraction, with a small amount in the nuclear fraction, less in the mitochondrial fraction, and none in the myofibrillar fraction (Fig. 2C). In contrast, all of the p38β was localized to the myofibrillar fraction, which required SDS for solubilization (Fig. 2C). Accordingly, the levels of phospho- and total p38α were assessed in the cytosolic and nuclear fraction, whereas the myofibrillar fractions were used to assess phospho- and total p38β levels.When p38β was assessed, no statistically significant difference was found between the TG and NTG mouse hearts (data not shown). However, greater differences were observed when p38α was assessed. The level of phospho-p38α was increased by 8.7-fold in the cytosol of TG mouse hearts (Fig. 3, A and B). Unexpectedly, in this same fraction the level of total (T)-p38α was decreased by 52% (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicate that p38α was activated by 16.8-fold in the TG mice (Fig. 3C). The levels of phospho (P)- and total ERK were not significantly different in the two mouse lines (Fig. 3, A-C). P-JNK was undetectable in the cytosolic fractions in both mouse lines (Fig. 3A); however, total JNK was detectible, and although the significance is unknown compared with cyto-NTG, it was significantly reduced by 22% (Fig. 3, A and B). The results in the nuclear extracts qualitatively mirrored those in the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 3, D-F).Fig. 3Measurement of phosphorylated and total p38, ERK, and JNK.

Two-dimensional guided M-mode echocardiography indicated very little functional difference between the TG and NTG mice (Table III). Compared with NTG, the TG mice did display a lower heart rate, a mildly increased LV end-systolic dimension, and decreased % fractional shortening. The mildly reduced fractional shortening in TG mice is most likely the result of the lower resting heart rate. But as a whole, the morphological and functional evaluation showed little difference between the MKK6 TG and NTG mouse hearts. Histological examination after hematoxylin and eosin staining of paraffin-embedded sections showed no difference in the ventricular morphology or the myocyte size between the NTG and TG mice (data not shown). Moreover, the TG mice exhibited no difference in life span from NTG littermates.Table IIBody and left ventricle weightsParameterNTGMKK6Body weight (g)28.2 ± 1.129.6 ± 1.1LV (mg)99.5 ± 5.487.7 ± 4.7 Open table in a new tab Table IIIEchocardiographic dataParameterNTGMKK6Heart rate684 ± 12.8630 ± 13.7ap < 0.05 compared to NTG.LVEDD (mm)3.48 ± 0.043.64 ± 0.08LVESD (mm)1.22 ± 0.081.59 ± 0.11ap < 0.05 compared to NTG.%FS64.9 ± 2.156.1 ± 2.9ap < 0.05 compared to NTG.Ejection Time36.67 ± 0.9941.67 ± 1.77Mean Vcfc(circ/s)5.3 ± 0.24.3 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 compared to NTG.SEPth (mm)0.67 ± 0.040.66 ± 0.02PWth (mm)0.72 ± 0.040.73 ± 0.01a p < 0.05 compared to NTG.

Mice were subjected to 30 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 24 h of reperfusion. The region at risk and the infarcted region were delineated by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and pthalo blue staining. Although the region at risk, as a percentage of the left ventricular weight was similar in TG (33.1%) and NTG mice (36.8%), the infarct sizes were significantly different, representing 28.1 and 42.9% that of the region at risk in the TG and NTG mouse hearts, respectively (Table IV).

https://openalex.org/W2022650754,"Src plays an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration. Altered Src activity has been strongly implicated in the development, growth, progression, and metastasis of human cancers. We have analysed the change and regulation of Src upon cell detachment in anoikis-resistant human lung adenocarcinoma cells and compared with that of relatively normal and anoikis-sensitive epithelial cells. We found that Src activity was increased in the anoikis-resistant lung tumor cells when they were detached and cultured in suspension. The detachment-induced Src activation in the tumor cells compensates for the loss of cell survival signals caused by disruption of cell--matrix interactions and contributes to anoikis resistance of the tumor cells. Pyk2, rather than PI 3K/Akt or Erk, appears to be the key downstream effecter of Src in mediating the cell survival signals. The increased Src activity is mainly due to the phosphorylation of Tyr-419, rather than the dephosphorylation of Tyr-530 of Src protein. PDGFR, not FAK or EGFR, appears to be the upstream protein tyrosine kinase responsible for the detachment-induced Src activation in the lung tumor cells. The increased Src activity upon cell detachment may contribute to the metastasis potential of malignant tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2005429042,"N-CoR and SMRT are corepressor paralogs that partner with and mediate transcriptional repression by a wide variety of metazoan transcription factors, including nuclear hormone receptors. Although encoded by distinct genetic loci, N-CoR and SMRT share substantial sequence interrelatedness, form analogous assemblies with histone deacetylases and auxiliary factors, can interact with overlapping sets of transcription factor partners, and exert overlapping functions in cells. SMRT is subject to negative regulation by MAPK signaling pathways operating downstream of growth factor and stress signaling pathways. We report here that whereas activation of MEKK1 leads to phosphorylation of SMRT, its dissociation from its transcription factor partners in vivo and in vitro, and its redistribution from the cell nucleus to a cytoplasmic compartment, N-CoR is refractory to all these forms of regulation. In contrast to this MAPK cascade, other signal transduction pathways operating downstream of growth factor/cytokine receptors appear able to affect both corepressor paralogs. Our results indicate that SMRT and N-CoR are embedded in distinct regulatory networks and that the two corepressors interpret growth factor, cytokine, differentiation, and prosurvival signals differently.

In the absence of hormone ligand, nuclear receptors can recruit a corepressor complex containing the SMRT protein, leading to repression of target gene expression (14Chen J.D. Evans R.M.

Conversely, binding of hormone agonist causes the release of the SMRT corepressor complex and the recruitment of coactivator complexes that enhance target gene expression (20Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Many coactivators possess histone acetyltransferase activity, whereas the SMRT corepressor recruits histone deacetylases, such as HDAC3 (1Chen J.D. Li H. Crit. Rev.

Acetylation and deacetylation of nucleosomal histones by these coactivator and corepressor complexes, operating together with other covalent histone modifications, create a code that influences the interaction of the chromatin with additional factors and its accessibility to the general transcriptional machinery (22Ayer D.E.

Besides histone deacetylases, the SMRT complex contains additional protein components, such as TBL1/TBLR1 and GPS2, that help stabilize its overall structure and that may contribute to the release of the corepressor complex in response to hormone agonist (35Guenther M.G. Lane W.S. Fischle W. Verdin E. Lazar M.A. Shiekhattar R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1048-1057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Li J. Wang J. Nawaz Z. Liu J.M. Qin J. Wong J.

Cell. 2002; 9: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar); other polypeptides, such as mSin3 and an assortment of additional histone deacetylases, can also interact with SMRT, but the association of these latter polypeptides with the SMRT complex in vivo and their contribution to SMRT-mediated repression remain incompletely elucidated (reviewed in Ref. 6Privalsky M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). SMRT therefore acts as a molecular platform on which the remainder of the corepressor complex assembles and serves as the principal contact between the corepressor complex and its transcription factor partners. Regulatory events that cause a dissociation of SMRT also cause the release of the remainder of the corepressor complex and a loss of repression (20Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Privalsky M.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 254: 117-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, a second corepressor protein, denoted N-CoR, is widely distributed in vertebrates and performs similar or identical functions compared with SMRT (40Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld G.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 41Seol W. Mahon M.J. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1646-1655PubMed Google Scholar). Although encoded by a distinct genetic locus, N-CoR shares the same overall molecular architecture and significant amino acid identity with SMRT (see Fig. 1A); interacts with many of the same transcription factors partners (although, in some cases, with different affinities); and assembles into similar or identical complexes with TBL1, TBLR1, and GPS2 and with other known or suspected corepressor components (reviewed in Ref. 6Privalsky M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Despite these many parallels between SMRT and N-CoR, these corepressor paralogs were established and subsequently maintained as distinct gene products from the beginning of the vertebrate evolutionary radiation and perform distinct functions in cells (reviewed in Ref. 6Privalsky M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). What differences do N-CoR and SMRT therefore manifest at the molecular level to account for their distinct biological and evolutionary properties? We have shown that growth factor receptors are important regulators of SMRT function and operate through a MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase; T3R, thyroid hormone receptor; T3, triiodothyronine; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Gal4DBD, Gal4 DNA-binding domain; Gal4AD, Gal4 activation domain; RARα, retinoic acid receptor-α; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. cascade (42Hong S.H.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6612-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor or its downstream mediator, MEKK1, leads to inhibition of the ability of SMRT to interact with its transcription factor partners and a redistribution of SMRT from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (42Hong S.H. Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1161-1171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Hong S.H. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6612-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These effects of MEKK1 on SMRT represent an important nexus between growth factor signaling and nuclear receptor function and contribute to the differentiation-promoting effects of arsenic trioxide treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia (44Hong S.H. Yang Z. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7172-7182Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We report here that direct phosphorylation of SMRT by MEKK1 is sufficient to inhibit the SMRT/thyroid hormone receptor (T3R) interaction in vitro and that the relocalization of SMRT to the cytoplasm in cells expressing MEKK1 occurs unaccompanied by the T3R partner (which is retained in the nucleus). More important, we also report that N-CoR is unexpectedly resistant to these inhibitory effects of MEKK1 under conditions in which SMRT function is strongly suppressed. Unlike SMRT, N-CoR is refractory to MEKK1 phosphorylation, does not release from nuclear receptor partners in vitro or in vivo, and does not detectably change in its subcellular distribution in response to MEKK1 signaling. Taken together with the observations by other investigators, these results indicate that the SMRT and N-CoR corepressor paralogs are subject to distinct forms of regulation. We suggest that these divergent forms of control help account for the establishment and retention of these two distinct forms of corepressor during vertebrate evolution.

The pSG5-Myc vector was created by inserting a synthetic oligonucleotide (MWG Biotech, High Point, NC) encoding a Myc epitope tag into an expanded multiple cloning site in pSG5. The pSG5-Myc-T3Rα, pSG5-Myc-SMRTτ-(1-2423), and pSG5-Myc-N-CoR-(1-2453) vectors were created using PCR to introduce approximate restriction sites on the ends of the corresponding open reading frames and by ligating the DNA products into the pSG5-Myc vector. The pCMV-GFP-SMRTτ-(1-2423) and pCMV-GFP-N-CoR-(1-2453) expression vectors were created by inserting PCR-generated DNAs containing the corresponding open reading frames into the pCMV-GFP vector (43Hong S.H. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6612-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). PCR-generated DNAs encoding the S1 domain of SMRTα (amino acids 2313-2517) or the S1 and S2 domains of SMRTα (amino acids 2077-2517) were cloned into pGEX-KG (47Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) to yield the pGEX-SMRTα-S1-(2313-2517) and pGEX-SMRTα-S1/S2-(2077-2517) constructs. The pGEX-N-CoR-N1-(2211-2453) and the pGEX-N-CoR-N1/N2/N3-(1817-2453) vectors were created by inserting the HindIII-SalI or ApaI-SalI fragment of N-CoR into a pGEX-KG vector bearing an expanded multiple cloning site. All clones were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The origins of pCMV5-FLAG-ΔMEKK1-(817-1493), pCMV-HA-MEK1(R4F), pMT3-ERK1, pSG5-v-ErbB, pLNC-v-Raf1, and pCMV-v-Ras plasmids were described previously (42Hong S.H. Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol.

A constitutively active clone of Akt, pCMV-Akt1(S473D), was the generous gift of Marty Mayo (University of Virginia). Baculovirus constructs for T3Rα and His6-ΔMEKK1 were described previously (43Hong S.H. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6612-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 48Chen H.W.

Cell Culture—CV-1 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose, l-glutamine, and pyridoxine hydrochloride (Invitrogen) and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. For expression of His6-ΔMEKK1 in the baculovirus expression system, Sf9 cells were maintained and infected in Ex-cell 420 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; cells were incubated at 28°C in a humidified atmosphere. Mammalian Two-hybrid Analysis—CV-1 cells (3.0 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate) were transiently transfected, 24 h after plating, using Effectene transfection reagent (QIAGEN Inc.) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Transfection mixtures included 50 ng of the appropriate pSG5-Gal4AD vector, 12.5 ng of the appropriate pSG5-Gal4DBD vector, 50 ng of the pADH-Gal4-17-mer luciferase reporter, either 50 ng of pCH110 or 10 ng of pCMV-LacZ as an internal transfection control, appropriate expression vectors for the indicated signal transducers, and/or an empty vector, as appropriate. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without 1 μm triiodothyronine (T3), 1 ng/ml interleukin-1β (IL-1β), 10 ng/ml anisomycin, and/or 1 μm U0126, as indicated. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection and lysed in lysis buffer (100 μl/well) containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 91 mm K2HPO4, and 9.2 mm KH2PO4. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described previously (43Hong S.H. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6612-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 45Hauksdottir H. Farboud B. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—CV-1 cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate) were transfected with various combinations of Myc-T3Rα, Myc-SMRTτ, Myc-N-CoR, a constitutively active MEKK1 construct, or appropriate amounts of equivalent empty vectors using the Effectene protocol described above. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection and lysed by a 30-min incubation at 4°C in 300 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer consisting of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mm KH2PO4) plus 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mg/ml iodoacetamide, 100 μm Na3VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Complete phosphatase inhibitor mixture I (EMD Biosciences, Inc., La Jolla, CA), and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4°C. A 15-μl aliquot of each cell lysate was saved, and the remaining lysate was incubated at 4°C for 1 h with rabbit anti-v-ErbA polyclonal antiserum (diluted 1:100) (49Bonde B.G. Privalsky M.L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1314-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (50% slurry) were added, and the samples were incubated overnight at 4°C on a rotator. The Sepharose beads and any proteins bound to them were collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4°C for 2 min. The beads were washed four times with 300 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer, and any proteins remaining bound to the beads were then eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer; resolved by SDS-PAGE using a NuPAGE Novex Tris acetate 3-8% gradient gel system (Invitrogen); and visualized by immunoblotting using mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:200; Gamma One Laboratories, Lexington, KY), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (diluted 1:1500; Bio-Rad), and the ECL Plus Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting chemiluminescent signal was detected and quantified using a Fluorchem 8900 digital detection system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). In Vitro Kinase Assays—GST-SMRT and GST-N-CoR fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified by binding to glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (32Wong C.W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5500-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Purified GST-corepressor proteins were eluted in buffer containing 20 mm glutathione, 5% glycerol, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture in 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0). The His6-tagged ΔMEKK1 proteins were expressed by baculoviral infection of Sf9 cells. Approximately 7 × 106 Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding His6-ΔMEKK1. Infected cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with PBS, resuspended in 3 ml of sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma)), and lysed by sonication. Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 0.1%; the samples were vortexed briefly; and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4°C. The His6-ΔMEKK1 protein was then purified by adding 200 μl of prewashed Talon Superflow metal affinity resin (Clontech), mixing the samples for 20 min at room temperature, and collecting the resin beads by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 2 min at 4°C. The resin was washed four times with sonication buffer, and the protein was eluted in 200 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 400 mm imidazole, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture. The eluate was dialyzed overnight in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol. 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture was added, and the samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored as aliquots at -80°C. For phosphorylation in vitro, 10 μl of the GST-SMRT or GST-N-CoR protein were incubated overnight at 30°C with 2 μl of His6-ΔMEKK1 and 1 mm ATP (Sigma) in MEKK1 assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 16.7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× Complete phosphatase inhibitor mixture I) in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. The reactions were collected the following day for use in the appropriate electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—An annealed oligonucleotide probe representing a direct repeat of AGGTCA with a 4-base spacer (termed DR-4) was radiolabeled with 32P by fill-in synthesis with Klenow DNA polymerase. T3Rα was isolated from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (50Yoh S.M. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16857-16867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GST-SMRT-S1, GST-SMRT-S1/S2, GST-N-CoR-N1, and GST-N-CoR-N1/N2/N3 protein constructs were isolated from E. coli and incubated with or without recombinant ΔMEKK1 as described above. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were initiated by mixing the T3Rα preparation with the radiolabeled DNA probe (50,000 cpm) in binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mg/ml BSA, 20 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 1 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 14.5 μl. For supershift experiments, the above reactions were subsequently incubated for 15 min on ice with 5 μl of the indicated dilution of the GST-corepressor protein (either treated with ΔMEKK1 or not). The resulting DNA·protein complexes were resolved using a 5% polyacrylamide (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel and 0.5× 44 mm Tris base, 44 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA electrophoresis system. The gels were dried, and radioactivity was visualized and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Fluorescence Microscopy—CV-1 cells (1.0 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate) were allowed to attach to 22 × 22-mm coverslips and transfected using the Effectene protocol described above. Cells were fixed 48 h after transfection in a chilled (-20°C) mixture of 50% acetone and 50% methanol for 10 m at 4°C. After aspiration of the fixing agent, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 2% BSA. The primary mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:500) or a pre-absorbed control mixed with Myc-neutralizing peptide (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) was added to the coverslips in PBS containing 2% BSA and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The coverslips were then washed three times with PBS containing 2% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG antibody (diluted 1:1000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS containing 2% BSA. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS containing 2% BSA and three times with PBS alone and incubated for 5 m at room temperature in PBS containing 0.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The coverslips were again washed three times with PBS and once with distilled water, and the excess moisture was removed by aspiration. The coverslips were mounted on slides using 25 μl of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and sealed with fingernail polish. The slides were visualized using a Nikon Microphot epifluorescence microscope. Digital images were captured with a Nikon Cool Pix 4500 digital camera. For quantification of the fluorescence microscopic data, 100 transfected cells were counted at random from each slide and scored for the following GFP-SMRT or GFP-N-CoR subcellular localization: nuclear, cytoplasmic, nuclear equal to cytoplasmic, or undeterminable. Phosphorylation/Dephosphorylation Assays—CV-1 cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate) were transfected with the appropriate mammalian expression vectors using the Effectene protocol described above. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection by mechanical scraping and lysed by a 30-min incubation at 4°C in 250 μl of cell extraction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C, and the lysates were divided into two equal aliquots. One aliquot was treated for 30 min at 37°C with 10 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and one aliquot was mock-treated. The samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE using the NuPAGE Novex Tris acetate 3-8% gradient gel system. The electrophoretograms were visualized by immunoblotting using r"

Their respective cellular functions are poorly understood. Mass spectrometry and immunoblotting showed that two closely related species, the ciliates Tetrahymena and Paramecium, have dramatically different compositions of tubulin post-translational modifications in structurally identical axonemes. Whereas the axonemal tubulin of Paramecium is highly glycylated and has a very low glutamylation content, the axonemal tubulin of Tetrahymena is glycylated and extensively glutamylated. In addition, only the α-tubulin of Tetrahymena undergoes detyrosination. Mutations of the known glycylation sites in Tetrahymena tubulin affected the level of each polymeric modification type in both the mutated and nonmutated subunits, revealing cross-talk between α- and β-tubulin. Ultrastructural analyses of glycylation site mutants uncovered defects in the doublet B-subfiber of axonemes and revealed an accumulation of dense material in the ciliary matrix, reminiscent of intraflagellar transport particles seen by others in Chlamydomonas. We propose that polyglycylation and/or polyglutamylation stabilize the B-subfiber of outer doublets and regulate the intraflagellar transport.

Among PTMs, two polymeric modifications, glutamylation and glycylation, substantially increase the heterogeneity of the α/β-tubulin heterodimer. These tubulin modifications, referred to as polyglutamylation and polyglycylation, correspond to the addition of a peptide polymer consisting of several glutamates (5Eddé B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.P.

These two PTMs will be referred to as “polymodifications” throughout this report. Polymodifications generate peptide branches of variable lengths distributed on several glutamate acceptor sites in the C-terminal tails of α- and β-tubulin (7Redeker V. Rossier J. Frankfurter A.

Whereas polyglycylation is restricted to axonemes in the ciliated and flagellated metazoan cells, polyglutamylation occurs in both axonemes and basal bodies (12Fouquet J.P. Kann M.L. Péchart I.

In these highly differentiated cells, the microtubular networks are involved in nuclear divisions, intracellular transport, organelle positioning, and are associated with specialized organelles that function in osmotic regulation, feeding, excretion, and locomotion. The α- and β-tubulins of ciliates are biochemically heterogeneous (17Bré M.H. de Néchaud B. Wolff A. Fleury A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 27: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Bré M.H. Redeker V. Vinh J. Rossier J. Levilliers N. Mol. Biol.

A. 1985; 82: 6908-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that structural differences among tubulin isoforms are important in generating functionally distinct types of microtubules in a single cell. However, genetic and biochemical studies showed that in ciliates only one or two gene isotypes of α- and β-tubulin form the bulk of microtubules (6Redeker V. Levilliers N. Schmitter J.M. Le Caer J.P. Rossier J. Adoutte A. Bré M.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1688-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 25Dupuis P.

Cell. 1996; 87: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, the large number of tubulin isoforms present in ciliates is mainly the result of PTMs (see refs. 6Redeker V. Levilliers N. Schmitter J.M. Le Caer J.P. Rossier J. Adoutte A. Bré M.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1688-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar and 29Gaertig J. Cruz M.A. Bowen J. Gu L. Pennock D.G. Gorovsky M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, ciliates provide a favorable model for assessing the function of tubulin PTMs. Recently, by means of site-directed mutagenesis, three and five glycylation sites were identified in α- and β-tubulin of Tetrahymena, respectively (30Xia L. Hai B. Gao Y. Burnette D. Thazhath R. Duan J. Bré M.H. Levilliers N. Gorovsky M.A. Gaertig J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Whereas all three sites of α-tubulin are dispensable, similar sites in β-tubulin are essential for cell survival. Specifically, among the five sites on β-tubulin, single and double site mutations did not affect cells, but triple site mutations resulted in either hypomorphic or lethal phenotypes, in a site-specific manner. Viable triple site β-tubulin mutants grow and move slowly and have occasional defects in cytokinesis (30Xia L. Hai B. Gao Y. Burnette D. Thazhath R. Duan J. Bré M.H. Levilliers N. Gorovsky M.A. Gaertig J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The lethal mutants have disorganized and paralyzed axonemes and are completely blocked in cytokinesis, before their death. The axonemes in the lethal mutants lack the central pair and contain peripheral singlets instead of doublets (31Thazhath R. Liu C. Gaertig J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The five glycylatable glutamates in β-tubulin of Tetrahymena, deduced from site-directed mutagenesis and immunoblotting (Glu437, Glu438, Glu439, Glu440, and Glu442), are homologous to the glycylation sites identified directly by mass spectrometry in Paramecium (9Vinh J. Langridge J.I. Bré M.H. Levilliers N. Redeker V. Loyaux D. Rossier J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3133-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Less is known about the site location and function of glutamylation in both ciliate species. Immunological data showed the presence of glutamylated tubulin in ciliates (17Bré M.H. de Néchaud B. Wolff A. Fleury A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 27: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because glycylation and glutamylation sites are located in proximity within the C-terminal tails of α- or β-tubulin (32Mary J. Redeker V. Le Caer J.P. Rossier J. Schmitter J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9928-9933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Plessmann U. Weber K. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Weber K. Schneider A. Westermann S. Müller N. Plessmann U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), it is possible that the mutations of glycylation sites of Tetrahymena (30Xia L. Hai B. Gao Y. Burnette D. Thazhath R. Duan J. Bré M.H. Levilliers N. Gorovsky M.A. Gaertig J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Thazhath R. Liu C. Gaertig J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) also affect glutamylation. Here, a structural analysis of WT and mutated Tetrahymena tubulins was undertaken to systematically characterize PTMs on each tubulin subunit and to determine how mutations of the known glycylation sites affect the level and the extent of each polymodification type. By mass spectrometry and immunoblotting, we show that, in contrast to axonemal tubulin of Paramecium, which exhibits a quantitatively minor polyglutamylation (6Redeker V. Levilliers N. Schmitter J.M. Le Caer J.P. Rossier J. Adoutte A. Bré M.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1688-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 17Bré M.H. de Néchaud B. Wolff A. Fleury A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 27: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the Tetrahymena α/β-tubulin is extensively polyglutamylated. Noticeably, the mutations of the known glycylation sites not only affected glycylation, but also glutamylation on the same tubulin subunit. Unexpectedly, mutations of glycylation sites on one tubulin subunit (α or β) affected the levels of polymodifications on the nonmutated subunits of the α/β-tubulin dimers. Thus, cross-talk between α- and β-tubulin exists, which affects the total levels of polymodifications on microtubules. Our ultrastructural analyses of cilia of the viable polymodification mutants showed that the B-subfiber of the outer doublets (ODs) is strongly affected. Furthermore, the glycylation site mutants accumulate electron-dense aggregates, similar to the intraflagellar transport (IFT) particles of Chlamydomonas, suggesting that tubulin polymodifications are involved in IFT. Cell Culture—Paramecium tetraurelia and Tetrahymena thermophila strains were grown as described previously (20Bré M.H. Redeker V. Vinh J. Rossier J. Levilliers N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Gaertig J. Cruz M.A. Bowen J. Gu L. Pennock D.G. Gorovsky M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Tetrahymena Mutants—Site-directed mutagenesis of the major α-tubulin of Tetrahymena encoded by the ATU1 gene (Atu1p) and the major β-tubulin encoded by the BTU1 gene (Btu1p) was performed as described before (30Xia L.

In T. thermophila, the wild type (WT) sequence of the β-tubulin C-terminal tail domain is 427DATAEEEGEFEEEEGEN443, with the known polyglycylation sites underlined.

The tail sequences of these mutants are 427DATAEEEGEFEDDDGEN443 (the mutant named βEDDD440) and 427DATAEEEGEFEAAAGEN443 (βEAAA440). A quadruple glycylation site β-tubulin mutant with the tail sequence 427DATAEEEGEFEDDDGDN443 (βEDDDGD442) was also used. For α-tubulin, the WT C-terminal tail sequence is 437IETAEGEGEEEGY449, with the known polyglycylation sites underlined, whereas the tail sequence of the viable mutant used here is 437IETAEGEGAAAGY449 (αAAA447) (30Xia L.

Preparation of Axonemal Tubulin—The axonemal tubulin of Paramecium was extracted from cilia as described previously (35Geuens G. Hill A.M. Levilliers N. Adoutte A. DeBrabander M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 939-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). WT and mutant Tetrahymena cilia were prepared as described (30Xia L. Hai B. Gao Y. Burnette D. Thazhath R. Duan J. Bré M.H. Levilliers N. Gorovsky M.A. Gaertig J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and axonemal tubulin was extracted exactly as done for Paramecium. Protein Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Axonemal proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide mini-gels (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar), containing 0.1% (wt/wt) SDS (99% pure, BDH, Poole, UK) at pH 8.3, according to Suprenant et al.

Under these conditions, the Paramecium or Tetrahymena α-tubulin migrates faster than β-tubulin. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose by the method of Kyhse-Andersen (37Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar). The blots were stained with Ponceau red, washed in antibody buffer, and then incubated overnight with one of the following primary antibodies: TAP 952 or AXO 49 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), raised against Paramecium axonemal tubulin (38Callen A.M.

Andreu D. Andreu J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) polyclonal antibodies directed against an N-terminal sequence of β-tubulin. After extensive washing, blots were incubated with peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibodies and processed for enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). The GT335 and C140 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. P. Denoulet (University of Paris VI, France) and Dr. J. M. Andreu (Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Madrid, Spain), respectively. Proteolytic Digestion of Axonemal Tubulins—Axonemal tubulin, typically 0.2-0.5 mg, was digested with the endoproteinase Asp-N (sequencing grade protease, Roche Applied Science) at an enzyme to tubulin protein ratio of 1:400 (w/w) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 6 h. After digestion, the peptide mixture was frozen at -20 °C. Prior to chromatography, the peptide sample was briefly sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min. Purification of the C-terminal Tubulin Peptides—The endoproteinase Asp-N digestion of Tetrahymena tubulin produces the C-terminal peptides of α- and β-tubulin beginning with an aspartate at positions 431 and 427, respectively, when the digestion is complete. Following incomplete digestion, longer α-tubulin C-terminal peptides were generated, beginning with an aspartate at position 424. The C-terminal peptides were separated on an arginine-Sepharose column and either desalted on a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge prior to direct analysis of the total peptide pools, as previously described (7Redeker V. Rossier J. Frankfurter A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14838-14844Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), or further separated by reverse-phase HPLC. In the latter case, about 100 μg of digested tubulin was injected into a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column (5 μm, 250 × 1 mm, Hypersil BDS-C18, flow rate of 200 μl/min). Peptides were eluted with a gradient of solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) consisting of 1% solvent B for 10 min, 1% to 5% solvent B in 1 min, 5% to 50% solvent B in 60 min, and 50% to 100% solvent B in 10 min. Peptide elution was monitored at 214 nm. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra were acquired in the linear mode on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager-STR, Perseptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA) equipped with a delayed extraction device. Desorption was produced by a nitrogen laser beam (λ = 337 nm). Delayed extraction time was set at 200 ns. The sample was mixed 1:1 (v:v) with a saturated solution of either sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxicinnamic acid, Aldrich) in 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Aldrich) in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed in the negative or positive ion mode, respectively. Except when indicated, the mass spectra shown were recorded in linear and positive ion modes, with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as the matrix. External calibration was performed using a mixture of neurotensin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (residues 18-39) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (residues 7-38) with average m/z of 1671.95, 2464.71, and 3658.17, respectively, for the deprotonated ions in the negative ion mode, and of 1673.95, 2466.71, and 3660.17 for the protonated ions. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Cells were washed with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 1 h, washed three times in cacodylate buffer, and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in cacodylate buffer, the cells were embedded in 2.5% agarose and dehydrated before inclusion in Epon. Thin sections were obtained with a Leica ultramicrotome and contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were observed with a Philips 208 electron microscope. Post-translational Modifications of Axonemal Tubulins of Paramecium and Tetrahymena—We examined the status of post-translational modifications of the C-terminal peptides of axonemal tubulin extracted from WT Tetrahymena and compared the Tetrahymena data with those of the already extensively characterized axonemal tubulin of Paramecium. Western blots with TAP 952 and AXO 49 mAbs, which recognize mono- and polyglycylated tubulins, respectively, showed that the axonemal tubulins of both ciliates contain mono- and polyglycylated sites in both subunits (Fig. 1). Note that, under conditions described under “Materials and Methods,” ciliate α-tubulins migrate faster than β-tubulins (24Suprenant K.A. Hays E. LeCluyse E. Dentler W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6908-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Noticeably, a striking difference in reactivity with the anti-glutamylated tubulin mAb, GT335, indicated the presence of a higher level of glutamylation in Tetrahymena than in Paramecium (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Western blot analysis of axonemal proteins of Paramecium (P), Tetrahymena (T), WT, and βEDDD440 mutant (EDDD), probed with GT335 mAb (1:50,000), specific for glutamylated tubulin, and with anti α-tubulin mAb, DM1A (1:4,000), and anti β-tubulin antibodies, C140 (1:4,000).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We purified the C-terminal tubulin peptides from cilia of both species by arginine-Sepharose chromatography (7Redeker V. Rossier J. Frankfurter A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14838-14844Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), following the endoproteinase Asp-N digestion. An analysis of the resulting total peptide pools by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry gave a broad picture of the modifications of both α- and β-tubulin C-terminal peptides (Fig. 3). This approach shows the diversity and reveals the most abundant peptide variants. Fig. 3 compares the C-terminal peptide pools of Paramecium (panels a and b) and Tetrahymena (panels c and d) axonemal tubulins. Using Asp-N, β-tubulins from both Paramecium and Tetrahymena were cleaved at the N-terminal side of Asp427, whereas α-tubulin was cleaved mainly at Asp424, but also less often at Asp431, generating “long” and “short” α peptides, respectively. In the Paramecium spectrum (Fig. 3a), the predominant β peptide (experimental average m/z = 2139.42) is a hexaglycylated variant (calculated average m/z = 2140.03). The other ions observed in this mass spectrum form a series with differences of 57 Da, the mass of a single glycine residue. The range of masses of these isoforms indicates addition of 4-18 glycine residues. In the spectrum shown in Fig. 3b, the long peptides of α-tubulin were observed. The two predominant peptides of isotypes α1 and α2 are triglycylated, and additions of 1-19 glycines were detected. A similar composition of the glycylated β-tubulin peptides of axonemal tubulin of Paramecium was observed previously using a different purification scheme (9Vinh J. Langridge J.I. Bré M.H. Levilliers N. Redeker V. Loyaux D. Rossier J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3133-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas an HPLC separation allowed the detection of less abundant peptides representing highly modified isoforms with 19-32 additional glycine residues (6Redeker V. Levilliers N. Schmitter J.M. Le Caer J.P. Rossier J. Adoutte A. Bré M.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1688-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The consistency of Paramecium results obtained with two different methods validates our experimental approach for a comparative study with the Tetrahymena tubulins (see below). In the mass spectrum obtained for Tetrahymena β-tubulin (Fig. 3c), the predominant molecular ion (experimental average m/z = 2142.61) corresponds to the C-terminal peptide of the tetraglycylated β-tubulin (calculated average m/z = 2143.0). Other ions corresponding to addition of up to at least 12 glycine residues were observed. Fig. 3d presents the molecular ions of the Tetrahymena α-tubulin. This mass spectrum showed an unexpected complexity and revealed two types of ion series, one with increments of 57 Da, the mass of a glycine residue, and one with increments of 129 Da, the mass of a glutamate residue. Thus, Tetrahymena α-tubulin is glycylated but also extensively glutamylated. A further dissection of the mass spectrum indicates that the first molecular ion (experimental average m/z = 2682.06) corresponds to a long α-tubulin C-terminal peptide starting at Asp424, which is also detyrosinated at its C terminus and lacks additional modifications (calculated m/z = 2681.75). The most abundant ions form a series corresponding to additions of 1 to at least 11 glutamates, with a predominant triglutamylated peptide. Other ion series that appear to be less abundant correspond to the addition of 1 to 5 or 6 glycine residues to either the nonmodified peptide, or to peptides simultaneously glutamylated at different levels. In these series, the nonglycylated form is predominant. We conclude that Tetrahymena α-tubulin is glycylated, extensively glutamylated, and detyrosinated, and often two or three modification types exist on the same tubulin molecule. In addition to the peptide pool analyses, some apparently less abundant but highly modified isoforms were detected by MALDI-TOF MS after HPLC separation of the peptide pool. High levels of polymodifications were revealed by the mass spectra of two HPLC fractions corresponding to β- and α-tubulin C-terminal peptides (Fig. 4, a and b). In Fig. 4a, minor forms of β-tubulin peptides were found to be glutamylated by addition of one to three glutamates, and each glutamylated peptide was glycylated by four to six glycines. In this mass spectrum, as in the spectrum of the peptide pool (see above), the tetraglycylated β-tubulin isoform is the predominant ion. In another HPLC fraction, α-tubulin was found to be glutamylated with the addition of up to 17 glutamate residues (Fig. 4b). Table I compares the types of polymodifications detected in WT Paramecium and Tetrahymena in peptide pools and HPLC fractions. It appears that, in Paramecium, both β- and α-tubulin subunits are glycylated to a larger extent than in Tetrahymena. The most striking difference involves polyglutamylation. Whereas this modificat"

The time course of p53 activation by mithramycin A was similar to the known chemotherapeutic compound 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Both 5-FU and mithramycin A induced site-specific phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15. However, in contrast to 5-FU, mithramycin A failed to activate p53 target genes including the cell cycle inhibitor p21Cip1 gene as well as the proapoptotic genes PUMA (p53-upregulated mediator of apotosis) and BAK (bcl2-homologous antagonist/killer) and blocked the induction of the above genes by 5-FU. Using transactivation assays in Sp1-deficient cells, we showed that mithramycin A inhibited the transcriptional activation of the p21Cip1 and PUMA promoters by Sp1 and p53. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and a novel protein–protein interaction assay based on biotinylation in vivo, we established that 5-FU enhanced the formation of p53–Sp1 complexes in solution and the subsequent recruitment of both factors to the p21Cip1 promoter. Mithramycin A also enhanced the recruitment of p53 to the distal p21Cip1 promoter but totally blocked the recruitment of Sp1 to the proximal p21Cip1 promoter. Our findings suggest that inhibition of Sp1 binding to the promoters of several p53 target genes, such as the p21Cip1 gene as well as certain proapoptotic genes, by mithramycin A, prevents the transcriptional induction of these genes by p53 and propose a mechanism that could account for some of the tumor suppressing and antiapoptotic effects of mithramycin A."
https://openalex.org/W2159401709,"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is the most notable example of a protein degraded by the 26 S proteasome without ubiquitination. Instead, ODC is targeted to degradation by direct binding to a polyamine-induced protein termed antizyme (Az). Antizyme inhibitor (AzI) is an ODC-related protein that does not retain enzymatic activity yet binds Az with higher affinity than ODC. We show here that like ODC, AzI is also a short-lived protein that undergoes proteasomal degradation. However, in contrast to ODC degradation, the degradation of AzI is ubiquitin-dependent and does not require interaction with Az. Moreover, Az binding actually stabilizes AzI by inhibiting its ubiquitination. Substituting the C terminus of AzI with that of ODC, which together with Az constitutes the complete degradation signal of ODC, does not subvert AzI degradation from the ubiquitin-dependent mode to the Az-dependent mode, suggesting dominance of the ubiquitination signal.

The polyamines spermine, spermidine, and their precursor putrescine are natural organic cations that play a crucial role in regulating fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transformation, and apoptosis (1Janne J.

The range of cellular polyamines is limited at the lower level by their essentiality for cellular proliferation and other fundamental cellular processes and at the higher limit by their cytotoxicity. Therefore, it is not surprising that cellular polyamines are highly regulated by multiple pathways such as biosynthesis, catabolism, uptake, and excretion. ODC 1The abbreviations used are: ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; Az, antizyme; AzI, Az inhibitor; Ub, ubiquitin; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); HA, hemagglutinin; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. 1The abbreviations used are: ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; Az, antizyme; AzI, Az inhibitor; Ub, ubiquitin; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); HA, hemagglutinin; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. is a key enzyme in the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, and its degradation constitutes an important regulatory mechanism that controls cellular polyamines. ODC is actually one of the most rapidly degraded proteins in eukaryotic cells, and its degradation is unique in being manifested without ubiquitination (9Bercovich Z. Rosenberg-Hasson Y.

Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Interaction of Az with ODC subunits has two outcomes: 1) ODC is inactivated due to trapping of transient ODC monomers by Az to form enzymatically inactive heterodimers (14Mamroud-Kidron E. Omer-Itsicovich M. Bercovich Z. Tobias K.E. Rom E. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and 2) the Az/ODC heterodimers are presented to the proteasome, and ODC is degraded (13Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T.

J. 1992; 283: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Az was also demonstrated to regulate the process of polyamine transport across the plasma membrane via a yet unresolved mechanism (17Mitchell J.L. Judd G.G. Bareyal-Leyser A. Ling S.Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18Suzuki T. He Y. Kashiwagi K. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Az is rapidly degraded by the proteasome (19Gandre S. Bercovich Z. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1316-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); however, its degradation does not occur while presenting ODC to the proteasome (19Gandre S. Bercovich Z. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1316-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Az degradation requires the presence of an active ubiquitin system in the cells (19Gandre S. Bercovich Z. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1316-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The ability of Az to regulate cellular polyamines by regulating both polyamine synthesis and uptake, together with the ability of polyamines to regulate its synthesis, suggest that Az synthesis functions as the cellular polyamine sensing mechanism and that Az is a central regulator of cellular polyamine metabolism. Mammalian cells contain yet another protein termed antizyme inhibitor (AzI), which may be of great relevance to the regulation of cellular polyamines. AzI displays extensive homology to ODC but lacks decarboxylating activity (20Murakami Y. Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3340-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). AzI binds Az with higher affinity than ODC binds to Az; thus, it may save ODC from Az-mediated proteasomal degradation (20Murakami Y. Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3340-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Nilsson J. Grahn B. Heby O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The potential ability to regulate Az suggests that AzI may play an important role in regulating cellular polyamine levels and cell growth. In the current study, we have studied the degradation of AzI. We show that AzI is degraded rapidly by the proteasome. In contrast to ODC degradation, which is greatly stimulated by Az, AzI degradation is inhibited by interaction with Az. Genetic and biochemical analysis reveal that AzI is degraded via the ubiquitin system and that interaction with Az interferes with its ubiquitination. Cell Lines and Culture—The cell lines used were: 293 human embryo kidney (293 HEK), NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and A31N-ts20, a BALB/c mouse cell line that harbors a temperature-sensitive E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, and its parental cell line A31N (25Chowdary D.R.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5.6% CO2. A31N and A31N-ts20 were cultured at 32 °C and transferred to 39 °C to inactivate the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme in A31N-ts20 cells (25Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Plasmids—DNA encoding AzI, Az (a clone that does not require frameshifting for expression), ODC, and HA-tagged ubiquitin were PCR-amplified using specific primers to which XhoI sites (5′ primer) and NotI sites (3′ primer) were appended. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and NotI and ligated into the bicistronic vector pEFIRES (26Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced using the overlap extension method (27Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K.

Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar). Transfections—Transient transfections of 293 HEK cells were carried out by the calcium phosphate method. Stable transfections of NIH3T3 cells and transient transfections of A31N and A31N-ts20 were carried out with jetPEI, a cationic polymer transfection reagent (Poly Transfection) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stably transfected cells were selected for growth in the presence of puromycin (Sigma). Immunoblot Analysis—Cell extracts were prepared by lysing phosphate-buffered saline-washed cells in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin (Sigma mixture)). The insoluble pellet was discarded, and protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and fractionated by electrophoresis in a 12.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. The resolved proteins were electroblotted to cellulose nitrate 0.45-μm membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The resulting blots were incubated with the indicated antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies. Signals were developed using Super Signal (Pierce) at 25 °C for 5 min, and the membranes were exposed to x-ray film (Fuji) and developed. The antibodies used were: mouse monoclonal anti-ODC (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-Az (14Mamroud-Kidron E. Omer-Itsicovich M. Bercovich Z. Tobias K.E. Rom E. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and rabbit polyclonal anti-AzI prepared in the present study using bacterially expressed AzI. In Vitro Protein Degradation Assay—In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were incubated in a reticulocyte lysate-based degradation mixture (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine (Sigma), 1.6 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase (Roche Applied Science), 200 μg/ml ubiquitin (Sigma) and 6 μl of reticulocyte lysate) at 37 °C for the indicated times. At the end of the incubation, samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and fractionated by electrophoresis in a 12.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel, and the labeled protein was detected using the Fuji Bas2000 phosphorimaging device or by autoradiography. In vitro Ub Conjugation Assay—A basic conjugation reaction is composed of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm MG132, 5 mm ATPγS, 0.5 μl of Ub-aldehyde, 8 μl of reticulocyte lysate (Promega biotech), and 35[S]methionine-labeled assayed protein. The conjugation assay was performed for 60 min at 37 °C (when AzI was tested) or 30 °C (when p53 was tested). When the ATP requirement for conjugation was tested, 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose and 150 units of hexokinase were added prior to the addition of the labeled protein, MG132, ATPγS, and Ub-aldehyde, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C to deplete ATP. In Vivo Ub Conjugation Assay—Twenty hours after co-transfection with the constructs encoding the tested protein and HA-Ub, the cells were treated for 4 h with MG132 (100 μm) and harvested, and cellular extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin (Sigma mixture)). Aliquots containing equal amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-ODC, anti-AzI (prepared in our laboratory), and anti-p53 (kindly provided by M. Oren) antibodies. The immunoprecipitated material was resolved by electrophoresis in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-HA antibodies (Sigma) AzI Is Rapidly Degraded by the Proteasome—AzI is a recently identified protein that shares high homology with ODC (20Murakami Y. Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3340-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Nilsson J. Grahn B. Heby O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). AzI has a higher affinity to Az, and therefore, it can rescue ODC from Az-stimulated degradation (20Murakami Y. Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3340-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Nilsson J. Grahn B. Heby O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The potential ability of AzI to function as a regulator of ODC stability and polyamine uptake prompted us to investigate whether AzI is a short-lived protein. For this purpose, we have generated NIH3T3 cell lines expressing AzI or ODC (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cellular extracts were prepared at various times following the addition of cycloheximide to the growth medium, and the levels of AzI and ODC were determined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, AzI has a very short half-life and is degraded even more rapidly than ODC. Since AzI degradation was completely prevented by MG132 (Fig. 1C), we concluded that AzI is degraded by the proteasome. AzI Degradation Does Not Require Interaction with Az nor Its C Terminus—Two segments of ODC are required for its Az-dependent degradation. The first, encompassing amino acids 117–140 of the mouse enzyme, constitutes the Az binding site (15Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1A and 2). The second, which contains the 37 most C-terminal amino acids of ODC, is for recognition of ODC by the 26 S proteasome (29Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P.

Although the Az binding site of AzI is similar to that of ODC, the C terminus of AzI shares only minimal homology to that of ODC (Fig. 2, A and C, respectively). Changing the sequence of the Az binding segment of mouse ODC to the sequence of the corresponding segment of trypanosome ODC that does not bind to Az (see Fig. 2A for the list of altered amino acids) resulted in significant stabilization of the mutant denoted ODC-MTM (14Mamroud-Kidron E. Omer-Itsicovich M. Bercovich Z. Tobias K.E. Rom E. Kahana C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To test whether Az binding is required for the degradation of AzI, nine mutations were introduced into the Az binding segment of AzI, yielding the AzI-MTM mutant (see Fig. 2A for the list of altered amino acids) that does not bind Az. The ODC-MTM and AzI-MTM mutants were transiently expressed in 293 cells, and their stability was determined. Although as reported previously, the ODC-MTM mutant was stable, AzI-MTM was rapidly degraded (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that interaction with Az is not required for AzI degradation. This result agrees with the previous demonstration that AzI degradation in rat hepatoma cells extract was not stimulated by Az (20Murakami Y. Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3340-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As stated above, alignment of the sequences of AzI and ODC reveals extensive differences in their c-terminal segments (Fig. 2C). Since minor changes within the C-terminal segment of ODC inhibited degradation, these differences by themselves suggest that the C-terminal segment of AzI is not required for its degradation. To test this directly, the C-terminal segment of AzI was deleted, and the stability of the resulting mutant was determined in transfected 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 2D, the AzI mutant lacking the C-terminal segment (amino acids 418–448) was rapidly degraded, whereas the parallel ODC mutant (lacking amino acids 423–461) was significantly stabilized. We therefore conclude that Az binding and the C-terminal segment are not required for AzI degradation. AzI Degradation Requires Ubiquitination—Since we demonstrate here that AzI degradation does not require interaction with Az and that its C-terminal segment does not serve as a degradation signal, we set out to investigate the possibility that AzI is degraded via the ubiquitin system, as is the degradation of the majority of cellular proteins. The following four experimental systems were used to determine whether AzI degradation requires ubiquitination. 1) AzI was transiently transfected into A31N-ts20 cells (25Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) that contain a thermosensitive ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, and into their parental A31N cells, and the transfected cells were maintained at the permissive temperature (32 °C). Twenty-four hours after transfection, half of the cells were transferred to the restrictive temperature (39 °C) for 24 h. Cellular extracts were then prepared, and the level of AzI was determined by Western blot analysis. AzI accumulated only in A31N-ts20 cells, upon their transfer to the non-permissive temperature (39 °C) (Fig. 3A). 2) AzI was translated in vitro in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of 35[S]methionine and subjected to degradation in a reticulocyte lysate-based degradation mix or in fraction II of reticulocyte lysate (F-II) that is depleted of ubiquitin. AzI was degraded in reticulocyte lysate-based degradation mix (Fig. 3B) but remained stable when incubated in fraction II (Fig. 3B). As reported before (9Bercovich Z. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15949-15952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ODC was efficiently degraded degraded in fraction II of reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 3B, F-II). 3) FLAG-tagged AzI or GFP was transfected into 293 cells together with HA-tagged ubiquitin. Cellular extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies, and the precipitated material was subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibodies. High molecular weight Ub conjugates were clearly observed in AzI-transfected cells but not in the GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 3C). 4) AzI, ODC, and p53 were synthesized in vitro in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of 35[S]methionine. Conjugation to ubiquitin was performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of MG132, γ-S-ATP, and Ub-aldehyde (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Ubiquitinated AzI was clearly observed (Fig. 3D). As expected, ODC remained unubiquitinated, whereas p53 was efficiently conjugated to Ub (Fig. 3D). The formation of both p53 and AzI conjugates required metabolic energy in the form of ATP (Fig. 3D). Based on these four independent criteria, we concluded that in contrast to ODC that is degraded by the proteasome without ubiquitination, AzI is degraded in a Ub-dependent manner. Interaction with Az Stabilizes AzI—Although the above experiments suggested that interaction with Az is not required for AzI degradation, Az is present in cells and binds AzI with high affinity (20Murakami Y. Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3340-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next set out to determine whether there will be any effect resulting from the interaction of AzI with Az. For this purpose, AzI and ODC were each expressed together with Az in 293 cells, and their level was determined. As expected, Az destabilized ODC so efficiently that ODC was practically undetectable in the transfected cells (Fig. 4A). In sharp contrast, AzI was dramatically stabilized when co-expressed with Az (Fig. 4A). No inhibition was observed when the AzI-MTM mutant was co-expressed with Az (Fig. 4A). Our results therefore demonstrate that Az stabilizes AzI and that binding to AzI is required for this stabilization. Interestingly, Az is also stabilized due to its interaction with AzI as demonstrated by its increased accumulation when it is co-transfected with increasing amounts of AzI (Fig. 4B). Az Inhibits AzI Ubiquitination—Having demonstrated that Az inhibits AzI degradation and that AzI degradation is Ub-dependent, we next set out to determine how Az interferes with this Ub-dependent degradation. We first tested whether Az interferes with the conjugation of Ub to AzI. For this purpose, FLAGAzI and HA-Ub were co-expressed in 293 cells with or without Az. Cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, and the precipitated material was resolved by electrophoresis and probed with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 5A, Az inhibited the conjugation of Ub to AzI. This effect of Az is specific, as co-expressed Az did not affect the MDM2-mediated conjugation of Ub to p53 (Fig. 5B). The ability of Az to inhibit conjugation of Ub to AzI requires binding of Az to AzI as determined by the inability of co-transfected Az to reduce conjugation of Ub to the AzI-MTM mutant (Fig. 5C). The actual decrease in the amount of AzI-Ub conjugates is even greater than visualized in Fig. 5C as there is a great increase in the amount of AzI in the presence of Az due to its stabilization (Fig. 5D). AzI·ODC Chimera That Contains the C-terminal Destabilizing Signal of ODC Is Degraded in a Ubiquitin-dependent Manner—We demonstrate here that AzI and ODC are two highly homologous related proteins that are recognized for proteasomal degradation by two different mechanisms. We therefore use these two related proteins to determine which mode of degradation, Ub-dependent or Az-dependent, will prevail. As demonstrated above, AzI possesses the segment required for Az binding but lacks a C-terminal degradation signal. We therefore decided to append the C-terminal destabilizing segment of ODC in place of the C-terminal segment of AzI and test whether this change will divert AzI degradation from the Ub-dependent pathway to the Az-dependent pathway. To do so, an NcoI site was introduced into the C terminus of AzI in a position that parallels the NcoI site of ODC. Next, the C-terminal segment of AzI was replaced with that of ODC (Fig. 6A). The resulting protein, denoted AzI·ODC, was expressed in 293 cells alone or together with Az. AzI·ODC behaved as AzI; namely, it was rapidly degraded, and this degradation was inhibited by co-expressed Az (Fig. 6B). These results strongly suggest that the signal that directs AzI to Ub-dependent degradation dominates. We show here that AzI, an ODC-related protein, is rapidly degraded in a Ub-dependent manner. Although Ub dependence is a standard feature in cellular protein degradation, Ub dependence in the case of AzI degradation is rather surprising since ODC is the most notable example of a short-lived cellular protein that undergoes Ub-independent degradation and since AzI shares significant homology with ODC. Although retaining strong binding affinity to Az, the C-terminal segment of AzI differs significantly from the sequence of the C-terminal degradation signal of ODC (Fig. 1A). It was therefore remarkable to find out that AzI was degraded even more rapidly than ODC. Moreover, mutant AzI lacking the entire C-terminal segment was still rapidly degraded, suggesting that the mechanism of AzI degradation is different from that of ODC degradation. It is interesting to note in this respect that yeast and trypanosome ODC, which naturally lack the C-terminal degradation signal, are both stable when expressed in mammalian cells (32Gandre S. Kahana C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 33Ghoda L. Phillips M.A. Bass K.E. Wang C.C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11823-11826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Az-mediated degradation is a unique process for the degradation of ODC, although it has recently been demonstrated that Az may also mediate the degradation of cyclin D1 (34Newman R.M. Mobascher A. Mangold U. Koike C. Diah S. Schmidt M. Finley D. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41504-41511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The majority of cellular proteins need to be polyubiquitinated prior to their recognition and degradation by the 26 S proteasome. We show here that in contrast to ODC degradation, AzI degradation requires polyubiquitination. This conclusion is based on results we obtained using several parallel experimental approaches. AzI accumulates in cells harboring temperature-sensitive ubiquitin activating enzyme when these cells are incubated at the non-permissive temperature. AzI is stable in fraction II of reticulocyte lysate, which lacks Ub, whereas ODC is efficiently degraded in this fraction. AzI·Ub conjugates are readily observed after co-expression of AzI and HA-Ub in transfected cells or when AzI and Ub are co-incubated in vitro in reticulocyte lysate. Interestingly, AzI was degraded in a Ub-dependent manner even when its C terminus was replaced by the C-terminal destabilizing signal of ODC, suggesting preferred recognition and channeling of AzI degradation to the Ub-dependent pathway. Degradation of mammalian ODC is greatly stimulated by Az via a unique mechanism of targeting to the 26 S proteasome (for a review, see Ref. 35Coffino P. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We show here not only that AzI degradation does not require Az but also that Az binding actually stabilizes AzI. This negating effect of Az on ODC and AzI may represent an important aspect of the polyamine regulating circuit. Since AzI can sequester Az, it is possible that AzI provides fine-tuning in the ability of Az to stimulate ODC degradation and inhibit polyamine uptake. For instance, the observation that AzI is induced during growth stimulation similarly to ODC (21Nilsson J. Grahn B. Heby O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that AzI may buffer Az, which appears upon increase of the intracellular concentration of polyamines. Our results demonstrate that both AzI and Az are stabilized upon their interaction. Therefore, it will be of interest to determine whether their association/dissociation is a regulated process and whether this process is affected by the intracellular polyamines. The ability of AzI to sequester Az and neutralize its ability to stimulate ODC degradation and inhibit polyamine uptake suggests that it may act as a central regulator of cellular polyamine homeostasis. Indeed, our recent studies demonstrate growth advantage of AzI overexpressing cells. We show that the inhibitory effect of Az on the degradation of AzI is exerted by inhibition of AzI ubiquitination. The ability of Az to prevent Ub-dependent degradation appears to be specific to AzI, as Az did not affect the ubiquitination of p53. It has been suggested that Az stimulates ODC degradation by imposing conformational changes that result in exposing its C-terminal degradation signal (36Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It is possible that similarly, Az inflicts conformational changes on AzI that hide its degradation signal. Alternatively, it is possible that Az competes with an E3 on binding to AzI. It will be of interest to identify the components of the Ub system, e.g. the E2 and E3 that mediate the ubiquitination of AzI as well as the signal that mediates the recognition of AzI by the Ub system.

This process involves the regulated and directed assembly of clathrin, AP180, epsin, and AP-2 adaptor complexes along with several accessory proteins at endocytotic “hot spots” surrounding the active zone (1Hannah M.J.

Among the conserved properties of different members of the synaptotagmin family is their ability to form disulfide cross-linked oligomers (6Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Biochemical studies using recombinant proteins have shown that the second C2 domain (C2B) of most if not all synaptotagmins harbors a binding site for the clathrin adaptor complex AP-2 (13Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), which at least partially overlaps with the binding site for N-type calcium channels (14Chapman E.R. Desai R.C.

Science. 1999; 285: 1268-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), two-hybrid analysis (16Jarousse N. Wilson J.D. Arac D. Rizo J. Kelly R.B. Traffic. 2003; 4: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and affinity chromatography, the synaptotagmin binding site within AP-2 has been mapped to the carboxyl-terminal portion of its μ2 subunit (17Haucke V. Wenk M.R. Chapman E.R. Farsad K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6011-6019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with an endocytic function of synaptotagmin at the synapse, it has been demonstrated that worms or flies expressing a truncation mutant of synaptotagmin I that lacks its C2B domain display reduced numbers of SVs (18Jorgensen E.M.

Microinjection of antibodies directed against the AP-2 binding cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin I into the giant synapses of squid (21Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Lewis F.M. Sugimori M. Niinobe M.

Lastly, overexpression of truncated synaptotagmin lacking its C2B domain exerts a dominant negative effect on endocytosis and clathrin-coated pit assembly that is strictly dependent on cysteine-mediated multimerization (8von Poser C.

We report here that a basic motif within the synaptotagmin C2B domain is required and sufficient for binding to AP-2 via its μ2 subunit and that this interaction is dependent on multimerization of the AP-2 binding site. Recombinant Proteins—GST- or histidine-tagged recombinant proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions from Triton X-100-solubilized bacterial homogenates. To obtain nucleic acid-free monomeric GST fusion proteins, recombinant bead-bound proteins were treated with 1 mg/ml RNase A plus 1 mg/ml DNase I in HBS (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were washed twice with 10 volumes of high salt HBS (HBS containing 1 m NaCl) and finally suspended in standard HBS (pH 7.4). This procedure effectively removed essentially all A260 absorbing nucleic acid contaminants as determined by measuring the A280/A260 ratio. Recombinant AP-2 “cores” were purified as described (23Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Peptides—Peptides were synthesized by standard solid-phase synthesis, high pressure liquid chromatography-purified, and verified by mass spectrometry. Peptide types and sequences were as follows: synaptotagmin I-derived (KR) peptide, (C)KRLKKKKTTIKK; TGN38-derived tyrosine (YQRL) motif peptide, (C)KVTRRPKASDYQRL; and CD3γ-derived dileucine (LL) motif peptide, RQSRASDKQTLLPN. Preparation of Liposomes and Liposome Binding Assay—Unilamellar liposomes were prepared as described (24Rohde G. Wenzel D. Haucke V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, dried lipids (60% phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 20% phosphatidylethanolamine plus 20% (w/w) of either PC or phosphatidylserine (PS)) were rehydrated in 0.3 m sucrose, reisolated, and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4). Binding assays were carried out by incubating 2 μg of purified μ2 (amino acids 157-435) with 100 μg of liposomes in cytosolic buffer (24Rohde G. Wenzel D. Haucke V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of calcium or EGTA for 15 min at room temperature. Liposomes were reisolated by ultracentrifugation and washed, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Liposome Incubation of Washed GST-C2B—Washed GST-C2B (2 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4) was preincubated with 2 mg/ml liposomes (60% PC, 20% phosphatidylethanolamine plus 20% of either PC or PS (w/w)) plus 1 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at room temperature and then for 45 min at 4 °C (rotating wheel). Samples were washed once in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. For some experiments, liposomes were disrupted by the addition of 1% Triton X-100 in HBS (pH 7.4), and the binding of AP-2 (from coat proteins) or μ2 was analyzed as described below. Oxidation/Reduction of Cysteine-linked Fusion Proteins—To obtain monomeric or dimeric GST-Cys-KR (or Cys-KR) or multimeric GST-Cys6-C2B fusion proteins, the high salt-treated proteins bound to beads were incubated with 1 mm dithiothreitol or 200 μm copper(II)-sulfate plus 600 μm (1,10)-phenanthroline for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were washed three times with HEPES-buffered saline and resuspended in HBS. Proteins were used within 24 h after purification. Pulldown Experiments—His6-tagged μ2 (50 μg) immobilized on beads was incubated with CHAPS-extracted rat brain synaptosomes (1 mg/ml) in buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride plus protease inhibitor mixture) for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed 3× with 50 volumes of buffer A, eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For studies using recombinant GST, GST-KR, GST-(Cys)-C2B clathrin coat proteins (60 μg/ml), or recombinant μ2 (30 μg/ml) were diluted into HEPES-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride plus 1% Triton X-100 and incubated with 30 μg of the respective GST fusion protein in a final volume of 0.5 ml for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed thoroughly, eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue or immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitations—Rat brain synaptosomes were kept in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 320 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm CaCl2. Solubilization buffer was added to give a final concentration of 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 160 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 400 μm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100 at a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml. Solubilized material was precleared by centrifugation, synthetic peptides (100 μm) were added where indicated, and, finally, samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies against γ-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD6; control) or α-adaptin (clone AP-6) for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 4×, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Transfection and Internalization Assay—PC12 or HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding c-Myc-synaptotagmin I, CD4, tetrameric CD4tailless-AA, or tetrameric CD4tailless-KR using Lipofectamine 2000™ and assayed 24 h post-transfection. Cells were starved in serum-free medium for 2 h. PC12 cells were chilled on ice, then anti-c-Myc antibodies were allowed to bind for 1 h at 4 °C. For HEK293 cells, anti-CD4 antibodies (Q4120) were diluted in serum-free medium, added directly to the cells, and allowed to become internalized. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, thoroughly rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and decorated with Alexa 488-labeled secondary antibodies under non-permeabilizing conditions for 2 h at room temperature. Remaining surface-exposed antibodies were blocked by adding excess unlabeled goat-anti-mouse IgG. Internalized protein was detected by decoration with Alexa 594-labeled secondary antibodies after Triton X-100 permeabilization. For quantification, CD4 chimera-expressing cells were scored on a relative scale. Cells undergoing “strong internalization” had internalized the majority of CD4 or CD4 chimeras during the 30-min incubation period. Transfected cells were scored as undergoing “weak-to-moderate” internalization if a minor fraction of the expressed protein had been endocytosed. For quantification of Myc-synaptotagmin I endocytosis, a binary mask was applied to determine the ratio of internalized over surface-exposed Myc-synaptotagmin I from epifluorescent images using SlideBook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Recent data from several laboratories have implicated basic sorting signals in the regulation of ligand-dependent internalization of multimeric membrane proteins such as AMPA-type glutamate and α1B-adrenergic receptors via association with the μ2-subunit of the clathrin adaptor complex AP-2 (25Lee S.H.

A similar basic motif has been shown to function as the major AP-2 binding site within the C2B domain of the multimeric SV membrane protein synaptotagmin (5Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 14Chapman E.R. Desai R.C. Davis A.F. Tornehl C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32966-32972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Mutation of this basic motif has been shown to block the direct association of GST-tagged recombinant synaptotagmin I with μ2-adaptin (17Haucke V. Wenk M.R. Chapman E.R. Farsad K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6011-6019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it may connect synaptotagmin to the endocytosis machinery. To confirm this hypothesis, we investigated the ability of a mutated synaptotagmin I in which two critical lysine residues within the presumed AP-2 binding site (Fig. 2A, asterisk) have been mutated to alanines to undergo endocytosis in PC12 cells. In agreement with data from other laboratories (27Jarousse N. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) we found that mutant synaptotagmin I was compromised in its ability to become internalized from the cell surface (Fig. 1, A and B). This finding indicates that two conserved lysine residues within the basic AP-2 binding site of synaptotagmin I-C2B are required for efficient endocytosis in PC12 cells.Fig. 1Internalization of synaptotagmin I requires a lysine-rich sequence within its C2B domain. Internalization of wild-type or mutant (K326A,K327A) c-Myc epitope-tagged synaptotagmin I from the surface of transfected PC12 cells is shown. Endocytosis (30 min at 37 °C) was monitored by an antibody-feeding assay using anti-Myc antibodies (9E11).

To find out whether this lysine-rich sequence within C2B contributes to the association of native synaptotagmin I with endogenous AP-2 in the brain, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in the presence or absence of a synthetic peptide comprising the putative AP-2 binding site of synaptotagmin I (KR peptide). We immunoprecipitated AP-2 and associated proteins from Triton X-100-lysed rat brain synaptosomes in the presence or absence of the basic peptide and analyzed the samples for the presence of synaptotagmin I and clathrin. Consistent with previous mapping studies (14Chapman E.R. Desai R.C. Davis A.F. Tornehl C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32966-32972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), synaptotagmin I could be detected in mock-treated samples but was absent from immunoprecipitates obtained from KR peptide-treated lysates. By contrast, the association of clathrin with AP-2 remained unaffected (Fig. 2B). To test whether the association of AP-2 and native synaptotagmin I involved μ2, we performed affinity chromatography experiments. As expected, hexahistidine-tagged μ2-adaptin selectively pulled down synaptotagmin I but not synaptophysin, another major synaptic vesicle protein (Fig. 2C), and this association was blocked by the addition of the basic synaptotagmin-derived (KR) peptide (Fig. 2D). No effect on the binding of synaptotagmin I to μ2 was seen if a dileucine motif-containing peptide was taken instead. These data indicate that native synaptotagmin I binds to AP-2 via interactions of μ2 adaptin with a basic motif within the C2B domain. Binding of Synaptotagmin-C2B to μ2-Adaptin in Vitro Is Modulated by Oligomerization—Because many of the proteins carrying basic internalization motifs are multimeric membrane proteins, we wondered whether binding of synaptotagmin's C2B domain to AP-2μ might be modulated by oligomerization. To this aim we studied the interaction between synaptotagmin I and μ2 further by affinity chromatography using recombinant bacterially expressed fusion proteins. Conventionally purified GST-C2B displayed robust binding to μ2-adaptin (Fig. 3A, lanes marked untreated). C2 domains have been shown to form non-covalent oligomers (6Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 28Fukuda M. Katayama E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, bacterially expressed recombinant C2B has been shown to contain nucleic acid contaminants that may facilitate oligomerization and/or affect its interaction with other molecules. We therefore analyzed the ability of high salt-washed, nuclease-treated monomeric GST-C2B to associate with μ2-adaptin. Surprisingly, this treatment rendered C2B almost incapable of binding to μ2 (Fig. 3A, lanes marked washed). The binding of negatively charged nucleic acids to recombinant C2B may reflect the propensity of the molecule to associate with negatively charged phospholipid head groups that, in the case of PS, has been shown to induce calcium-triggered C2 domain oligomerization (12Wu Y. He Y. Bai J. Ji S.R. Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Sui S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2082-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Calcium-induced synaptotagmin oligomerization is likely to be of physiological relevance during excitation-secretion coupling. Hence, we analyzed whether the addition of PS and calcium would restore the ability of GST-C2B to bind to AP-2μ. Indeed, pretreatment of washed GST-C2B with PS-containing liposomes in the presence of calcium completely restored its ability to bind to purified μ2. Other lipids such as PC (Fig. 3A), phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphoinositides, including phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, or inositol polyphosphates (see supplemental Fig. 1 in the on-line version of this article) were ineffective. No binding of μ2 to washed GST-C2B was seen in the presence of EGTA. This effect was unlikely due to a bridging function of μ2, because μ2 itself was unable to bind to PS-containing liposomes irrespective of the presence of calcium but was instead capable of associating with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Fig. 3B), which did not restore μ2 binding to C2B. Similar results were seen for the association of washed GST-C2B with native AP-2 from brain extracts (Fig. 3C). Pretreatment of bead-bound GST with PS-containing liposomes did not result in AP-2 binding (data not shown). The interaction of PS-treated, washed GST-C2B with AP-2 displayed characteristics described previously for the interaction of native synaptotagmin I with AP-2 adaptors (15Haucke V. De Camilli P. Science. 1999; 285: 1268-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The addition of a tyrosine-based endocytic sorting motif peptide (YQRL) stimulated the association of PS-treated GST-C2B with AP-2 from the brain, whereas an inactive mutant (AQRL) had no effect (supplementary Fig. 2 in the on-line version of this article). We also analyzed the binding of recombinant GST-C2B to synprint, the synaptotagmin binding site of N-type calcium channels (29Sheng Z.H. Yokoyama C.T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As seen for AP-2, high salt treatment of recombinant GST-C2B rendered the fusion protein unable to recognize histidine-tagged synprint. However, binding activity could be restored by preincubation with PS- but not PC-containing liposomes (Fig. 3D). Thus, negatively charged PS can restore the ability of nucleic acid-free C2B to associate with either AP-2 or N-type calcium channels. Binding of Recombinant Synaptotagmin I C2B Domain to Native AP-2 or Recombinant μ2-Adaptin Is Dependent on Multimerization—To test directly whether the ability of C2B to bind to AP-2 is dependent on synaptotagmin oligomerization, we constructed chimeric fusion proteins comprising GST, a hexacysteine-containing peptide linker, and the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I. The oligomerization state of such a chimeric protein can be controlled in vitro by adjusting the redox conditions (30Aziz Q.H. Partridge C.J. Munsey T.S. Sivaprasadarao A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42719-42725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol, the fusion protein migrated as a single band of ∼42 kDa. Copper(II)-phenanthroline-catalyzed oxidation of the cysteine residues in the spacer peptide resulted in the formation of disulfide-linked oligomers, mostly trimers and tetramers of 85 and 140 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4A). We then assayed monomeric or multimeric washed GST-Cys-C2B fusion proteins for their ability to bind to μ2-adaptin. Strikingly, only oxidized, multimeric forms of the C2B fusion protein bound effectively to μ2, whereas reduced monomeric C2B did not bind in the absence of PS and calcium (Fig. 4B). Similar results were seen for native AP-2 complexes (Fig. 4C). No binding to GST pretreated with oxidizing or reducing reagents could be detected. The association of multimeric GST-Cys-C2B with AP-2 was specific, as it could be inhibited by low micromolar concentrations of the basic C2B-derived (KR) peptide but not by a dileucine motif-containing peptide (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that multimerization might be a prerequisite for the recognition of the basic AP-2 binding motif within the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I. The Basic C2B Peptide Is Sufficient for Binding to AP-2 or μ2-Adaptin—To determine whether the basic motif within the C2B domain is not only required but also sufficient for AP-2 binding, we created a GST-fused synaptotagmin peptide (GST-KR). Upon incubation with Triton X-100-extracted rat brain homogenate, the GST-KR peptide pulled down AP-2, and this interaction could be competed by the addition of the chemically synthesized soluble KR peptide. No competition was seen if a dileucine-motif-containing control peptide was added instead. The concomitant presence of a peptide encompassing a tyrosine-based endocytosis motif (YQRL) stimulated the interaction between native AP-2 and the GST-KR fusion protein (Fig. 5A). GST-KR was also capable of efficiently interacting with purified recombinant μ2, and this interaction could be blocked by the addition of the soluble KR peptide but not by the addition of the YQRL peptide (Fig. 5B). In this case, no stimulatory effect of the YQRL peptide could be detected, which is in agreement with earlier findings using GST-C2B and in vitro translated μ2 (17Haucke V. Wenk M.R. Chapman E.R. Farsad K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6011-6019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because recognition of the C2B domain is apparently dependent on multimerization, we set out to define the minimal requirements for this association using the GST-KR peptide chimera and recombinant AP-2 core complexes (23Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). To this aim we constructed a fusion protein in which the basic KR peptide was connected to GST via a single cysteine residue. Upon exposure to oxidizing conditions, this fusion peptide dimerizes. As seen previously for the intact C2B domain, high salt-washed reduced GST-Cys-KR was incapable of binding to recombinant AP-2 cores, but binding activity could be restored by cystine-mediated dimerization (Fig. 5C). Fully assembled AP-2 core complexes lacking the distal 278 amino acids of μ2 encompassing the putative synaptotagmin binding site (17Haucke V. Wenk M.R. Chapman E.R. Farsad K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6011-6019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were unable to bind to GST-Cys-C2B (Fig. 6A) or GST-Cys-KR (not shown) irrespective of its oligomerization status. We then measured the affinity of chemically synthesized monomeric or dimeric KR peptides (>95% pure) for AP-2 cores by surface plasmon resonance. Dimerization drastically increased the affinity of the C2B-derived KR peptide for AP-2 cores ∼50-fold, resulting in high-affinity binding with a dissociation constant of ∼220 nm (Fig. 6B). The Basic KR Peptide Supports Endocytosis of Tetrameric CD4 Chimeras in Living Cells—Finally, we wanted to determine the physiological relevance of the interaction between the basic KR motif derived from synaptotagmin I and AP-2 for the internalization of plasma membrane receptors in living cells. To assess the ability of the KR peptide to facilitate the internalization of an otherwise non-endocytosed reporter protein, we grafted the basic motif onto the extracellular and membrane-spanning domains of the T cell surface glycoprotein CD4 (31Pitcher C. Honing S. Fingerhut A. Bowers K. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We transfected HEK293 cells with constructs encoding either wild-type CD4, which bears a dileucine-type internalization motif within its cytoplasmic domain, or artificially tetramerized (32Yuan H. Michelsen K. Schwappach B. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 638-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) tailless mutants in which the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 had been replaced with the basic C2B domain peptide from synaptotagmin I (CD4tailless-KR), or a poly-alanine control peptide (CD4tailless-AA). Wild-type CD4 as well as tetrameric CD4tailless-KR peptides were robustly internalized, whereas the tetrameric CD4tailless-AA mutant was not (Fig. 7, A and B). Weak internalization was detectable if the C2B domain peptide was presented in the context of monomeric CD4 (not shown). These data indicate that presentation of the basic synaptotagmin-derived AP-2 binding peptide as a tetramer is sufficient to restore internalization of a tailless CD4-chimeric mutant protein. In the present study we have investigated the interaction between the cycling synaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptotagmin and the endocytic clathrin adaptor complex AP-2. Consistent with earlier mapping studies (14Chapman E.R. Desai R.C. Davis A.F. Tornehl C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32966-32972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 17Haucke V. Wenk M.R. Chapman E.R. Farsad K. De Camilli P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6011-6019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have found that a basic region within the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I is required and sufficient for the association with AP-2, which mainly occurs via its μ2 subunit. Based on in vitro experiments using recombinant fusion proteins and functional studies in living cells, we have revealed a requirement of synaptotagmin-C2B multimerization for recognition by the μ2 subunit of AP-2 or binding to the synprint region of N-type calcium channels (29Sheng Z.H. Yokoyama C.T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This interaction is specific, as it could be inhibited by a basic peptide encompassing the putative AP-2 and synprint binding site within the C2B domain (14Chapman E.R. Desai R.C. Davis A.F. Tornehl C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32966-32972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have demonstrated here that a chemically synthesized dimeric KR peptide binds to AP-2 with nanomolar affinity. Similarly, mutations within this basic stretch have been shown to abolish the interaction between synaptotagmin I and AP-2 or synprint both in vitro (14Chapman E.R. Desai R.C. Davis A.F. Tornehl C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32966-32972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and in transfected neuroendocrine cells (27Jarousse N. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Multimerization of the C2B domain or the basic motif can be accomplished by two distinct mechanisms in vitro, namely calcium-dependent binding to acidic phospholipids (12Wu Y. He Y. Bai J. Ji S.R. Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Sui S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2082-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or cysteine-mediated cross-linking. Indeed, both mechanisms have been described as mediating calcium-dependent as well as calcium-independent homo- and hetero-oligomerization of native synaptotagmins (5Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 6Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 10Fukuda M. Kanno E. Ogata Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We thus believe that our results are of physiological relevance. Multimerization may therefore be a prerequisite for the correct functioning of synaptotagmin in excitation-secretion coupling via calcium channels as well as in SV membrane retrieval. The finding that synaptotagmin binding to AP-2 may depend on the correct assembly of synaptotagmin into multimers lends further support to a number of biochemical (13Zhang J.Z.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 7Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin internalization in vivo in addition to AP-2 presumably depends on or is facilitated by other adaptor proteins such as stonin 2, a synaptotagmin I- and AP-2-binding protein in the brain (33Martina J.A. Bonangelino C.J. Aguilar R.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 34Walther K. Diril M.K. Jung N. Haucke V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Basic endocytosis signals that are recognized by AP-2 complexes and perhaps other adaptors have recently been identified in a variety of membrane proteins. These include the GluR1-3 subunits of ionotropic AMPA-type glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses (25Lee S.H. Liu L. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Neuron. 2002; 36: 661-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), the α1B-adrenergic receptor (26Diviani D. Lattion A.L. Abuin L. Staub O. Cotecchia S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the cycling endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment protein 53 (ER-GIC-53) (36Kappeler F. Itin C. Schindler R. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6279-6281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar motif is also present in the transcytotic polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (see Ref. 25Lee S.H. Liu L. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Neuron. 2002; 36: 661-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and in the γ2 and β3 subunits of inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors. 3J. T. Kittler, V. Hauche, T. Smart, S. J. Moss, manuscript in preparation. A common feature of most of these proteins is their ability to become internalized in response to activation or ligand binding. In the case of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2, it has been demonstrated that the basic AP-2 binding site within its cytoplasmic tail is required for N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced AMPA receptor endocytosis and synaptic long-term depression (25Lee S.H. Liu L. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Neuron. 2002; 36: 661-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments indicate that GluR2 and synaptotagmin I in fact use a common μ2-dependent mechanism of association with AP-2.2 Similarly, agonist-induced activation of a basic motif within the α1B-adrenergic receptor facilitates its association with AP-2μ and concomitant receptor internalization (26Diviani D. Lattion A.L. Abuin L. Staub O. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19331-19340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Strikingly, all proteins displaying basic internalization motifs, including synaptotagmin I, ERGIC-53, pIgR, and AMPA-adrenergic, GABAA-adrenergic, and α1B-adrenergic receptors are oligomers (5Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 35Fache M.P. Moussif A. Fernandes F. Giraud P. Garrido J.J. Dargent B. J.

It thus appears that the basic sorting motif within the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I may be part of a family of related signals that facilitate regulated internalization of multimeric membrane proteins. Multimerization-dependent interactions of membrane proteins with sorting adaptors have also been implicated in regulating surface delivery of octameric KATP channels via an arginine-based signal (32Yuan H.

RecA is the central recombination protein in Escherichia coli and other bacteria, playing an important role in the processes of recombinational DNA repair (reviewed in Refs. 1Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar and 2Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 310-366Google Scholar). Additionally, RecA regulates the induction of the SOS response by facilitating the autocatalytic cleavage of the LexA repressor protein (3Walker G.C. Smith B.T. Sutton M.D. Storz G. HenggeAronis R.

In these important roles, RecA protein functions as a nucleoprotein filament.RecA protein filaments are assembled in a process featuring discrete nucleation and end-dependent extension phases (1Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 4Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Disassembly is also end-dependent, occurring at the opposite end to that at which assembly occurs. Both assembly and disassembly thus proceed 5′ to 3′ on the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SSB, single-stranded DNA binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SSB, single-stranded DNA binding protein.

Assembly can take place with ATP analogues that are not hydrolyzed by RecA protein, whereas disassembly requires ATP hydrolysis. The inherent rate of extension of RecA filaments during assembly must be faster than end-dependent disassembly or long filaments would never form.RecA filament assembly and disassembly must be directed in the cell to ensure that RecA activities initiate properly both temporally and spatially. One modulator of these dynamic processes is the SSB protein. The nucleation step of RecA filament assembly, but not the extension phase, is inhibited by SSB (1Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 9Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins play a role in the loading of RecA protein onto SSB-coated ssDNA (6Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol.

Two additional RecA filament modulators have been identified, RecX and DinI, which are particularly relevant to the SOS response.The RecX protein is an inhibitor of RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange, coprotease, and DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activities (14Stohl E.A.

In vitro, the RecX protein effectively blocks RecA filament extension, probably employing a capping mechanism (15Drees J.C. Lusetti S.L. Chitteni-Pattu S Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). RecX also binds along the length of the RecA filament (16VanLoock M.S. Yu X. Yang S. Galkin V.E. Huang H.

By blocking assembly while not affecting disassembly, a net disassembly reaction is observed in the presence of RecX (15Drees J.C. Lusetti S.L. Chitteni-Pattu S Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The interaction of RecX with RecA is affected by the RecA C terminus, as well as by the overall functional state of the RecA filament (17Drees J.C. Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; (October 4, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M409050200)Google Scholar). The recX gene is immediately downstream of the recA gene. The two genes are co-transcribed, although the RecX protein is synthesized at barely detectable levels during vegetative growth (14Stohl E.A. Brockman J.P. Burkle K.L. Morimatsu K.

Both RecA and RecX are induced during the SOS response leading to the suggestion that RecX mainly acts during SOS (14Stohl E.A. Brockman J.P. Burkle K.L. Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. Siefert H.S.

At the same time, DinI has a positive or neutral effect on most RecA activities (19Lusetti S.L. Voloshin O.N. Inman R.B. Camerini-Otero C.S. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

One exception is the RecA-mediated cleavage of the UmuD protein, which is inhibited by DinI even though the cleavage of LexA protein is not (21Yasuda T. Morimatsu K. Horii T. Nagata T. Ohmori H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3207-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). DinI protein acts mainly as a positive modulator of RecA function. Destabilization of RecA filaments and inhibition of RecA function can be observed when DinI is present at a 20–100-fold excess relative to RecA (19Lusetti S.L. Voloshin O.N. Inman R.B.

The DinI protein is not detectable during normal growth of the bacterial cells, but like RecX is induced at the beginning of the SOS response (22Voloshin O.N. Ramirez B.E. Bax A. Camerini-Otero R.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Separately, the RecX and DinI proteins have quite different and opposing effects on RecA filament dynamics. In this study, we set out to determine the effects of the two proteins on RecA filaments when they are added together.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzymes and Biochemicals—Escherichia coli RecA and SSB proteins were purified as described (23Lusetti S.L.

RecX protein is stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm potassium glutamate, and 50% (w/v) glycerol. Preparations were over 98% pure and free of detectable nuclease activities. The concentration of purified protein was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient 2.57 × 104m–1 cm–1 (17Drees J.C. Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

PstI, NdeI, and EcoRI restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs. Lysozyme, streptomycin sulfate, erythromycin, and all components of ATP regeneration and coupling systems were from Sigma. Hydroxyapatite Bio-Gel HRT resin was from Bio-Rad. Source 15Q and Sephacryl S-100 resins were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.Buffers and Media—P buffer contained 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% (w/v) glycerol. R buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% (w/v) glycerol. Luria-Burtani media (LB broth) was 10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, and 10 g/liter NaCl, with pH adjusted to 7.0.Cloning and Overexpressing the DinI Protein—The dinI gene was isolated from the E. coli genome (strain MG1655, a gift from George Weinstock (27Weisemann J.M. Weinstock G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 748-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) by polymerase chain reaction using DNA primers that added a NdeI restriction site upstream and an EcoRI restriction site downstream of the dinI gene. These primers were used to amplify a DNA fragment of the appropriate size (265 bp) by the polymerase chain reaction. The dinI gene fragment was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and then ligated into cloning vector pET21A (Novagen), which was digested with NdeI and EcoRI. This plasmid containing the native dinI gene under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter was designated pEAW334. The integrity of the entire dinI gene in this construct was verified by direct sequencing.Competent cells of E. coli strain STL327/pT7pol26 (23Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J. Korth J.

DinI protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.4 mm. Following a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, ∼17 g of cells were harvested by centrifugation, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C.Purification the DinI Protein—The DinI protein was purified by extensive modification of the published protocols (21Yasuda T. Morimatsu K. Horii T. Nagata T. Ohmori H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3207-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Voloshin O.N. Ramirez B.E. Bax A. Camerini-Otero R.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cell paste (17 g) was thawed slowly in 90 ml of sucrose solution (25% (w/v) sucrose and 250 mm Tris-HCl, 80% cation, pH 7.5). Cells were lysed by a 60-min incubation with lysozyme (in 250 mm Tris-HCl, 80% cation) to 2.5 mg/ml, followed by the addition of EDTA to 7 mm, sonication, and centrifugation. The lysate was precipitated by incubation of streptomycin sulfate to 3% for 60 min followed by centrifugation. The resulting lysate was precipitated with solid ammonium sulfate to 30% saturation and centrifuged. The DinI protein was precipitated from the supernatant with solid ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in P buffer, dialyzed versus P buffer, and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of P buffer and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 20 to 500 mm phosphate over 10 column volumes. Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis, pooled, and dialyzed versus R buffer plus 50 mm potassium chloride. The protein was then loaded onto a Source 15Q column. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of R buffer plus 50 mm potassium chloride and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 50–500 mm potassium chloride. Peak fractions were pooled as before, diluted 2-fold with R buffer, and reloaded onto the same Source 15Q column. The protein was eluted with R plus 500 mm potassium chloride to concentrate the protein. The eluted protein (8 ml) was immediately loaded onto a HR 26/60 Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column equilibrated in R plus 500 mm potassium chloride and washed with 1 column volume of the same. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed into R buffer, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. The concentration of the DinI protein was determined using the extinction coefficient of 1.44 × 104m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm (19Lusetti S.L. Voloshin O.N. Inman R.B. Camerini-Otero C.S. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

Incubation of 20 μm DinI protein (from the preparation used in these experiments) with 20 μm supercoiled plasmid DNA for 90 min at 37 °C results in the linearization of just over 1% of the DNA (data not shown). The activity does not co-elute with DinI protein during gel filtration chromatography, and is thus unlikely to be an activity of DinI. We have detected no effect of this activity on any of the DNAs used in the current experiments.DNA Substrates—Bacteriophage ϕ X174 circular ssDNA and replicative form I supercoiled circular duplex DNA were purchased from New England Biolabs and Invitrogen, respectively. Full-length linear duplex DNA (dsDNA) was generated by the digestion of ϕ X174 replicative form I DNA (5386 bp) with the PstI endonuclease. Circular single-stranded DNA from bacteriophage M13mp8 (7229 nucleotides) was prepared as described (29Neuendorf S.K. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

Plates were exposed to 0, 25, 50, and 75 J/m2 UV light (UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene), and the survival of the RecX-expressing strain was compared with each vector control strain.RESULTSExperimental Design—Using purified proteins, we explored the combined effects of the DinI and RecX proteins on RecA function. The RecA-mediated ATPase activity was used as the primary assay, providing a real-time measure of the status of the overall RecA filament. As previously demonstrated, changes in ATP hydrolysis seen when DinI or RecX are added to RecA filaments reflect changes in the absolute amount of DNA-bound RecA protein as opposed to changes in the intrinsic ATPase activity of the filaments (15Drees J.C. Lusetti S.L. Chitteni-Pattu S Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Lusetti S.L. Voloshin O.N. Inman R.B.

The effects of DinI and RecX on other RecA functions are also examined, and we make a start in the exploration of RecX and DinI function in vivo.The DinI and RecX Proteins Have Opposing Effects on RecA Filament Assembly and Disassembly—The primary effects of DinI and RecX proteins are shown in Fig. 1B. When DinI (8.4 μm) was added with RecA (1.2 μm) and circular ssDNA (2 μm) a slight increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis was observed. This reflects the DinI-mediated stabilization of the filaments and suppression of any RecA filament disassembly occurring at steady state (19Lusetti S.L. Voloshin O.N. Inman R.B. Camerini-Otero C.S. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30037-30046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When RecX (60 nm) is added instead of DinI, a slow decline in the ATP hydrolysis rate was measured as the RecA filaments disassembled. However, if the DinI protein was preincubated with RecA before the addition of the RecX protein, no decrease in ATP hydrolysis was observed. This suggests that DinI is protecting the RecA filament from the effects of RecX. This experiment was carried out under conditions that include a 7-fold excess of DinI protein relative to RecA. Previously we determined that this ratio is required for maximal stabilization of RecA protein filaments on ssDNA (19Lusetti S.L. Voloshin O.N. Inman R.B. Camerini-Otero C.S. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30037-30046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The effects of DinI and RecX in this experiment can be explained by a simple model. RecX protein does not promote disassembly, but simply allows it to occur without the compensating effects of RecA filament extension. If DinI binds to the filament and prevents the disassembly, the effects of RecX are countered.We carried out additional experiments to flesh out this model. We first reduced the concentration of the DinI protein so that it was equimolar with the RecA protein (1.2 μm, Fig. 2A). This is not enough DinI to completely stabilize the RecA filaments (19Lusetti S.L. Voloshin O.N. Inman R.B. Camerini-Otero C.S. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30037-30046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Disassembly of RecA protein was still observed in the presence of 60 nm RecX but the process was slower, indicating that DinI may be inhibiting but not preventing the RecX effects. This result again suggests a functional antagonism between the RecX and DinI proteins. As little as 60 nm RecX was sufficient to trigger complete disassembly of RecA filaments formed on these ssDNA substrates in about 15 min in the absence of DinI protein. The effects of 60 nm RecX in the presence of 1.2 μm DinI protein also suggest that the RecX-RecA interaction is more robust than the DinI-RecA interaction.Fig. 2The DinI and RecX proteins have opposing activities. The reaction was carried out as detailed in the legend to Fig. 1B and included the indicated concentration of DinI protein (A) (line labels indicate the concentration in μm) and/or 60 nm RecX and 8.4 μm DinI protein and/or the indicated concentration of RecX protein (B) added as described in the legend to Fig. 1B (line labels indicate the concentration in nm). Time 0 corresponds to the time of RecX addition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next wanted to determine whether RecX protein could overcome the effects of a DinI concentration (8.4 μm) sufficient to provide optimal stabilization of these same RecA filaments. We titrated RecX protein into reactions containing fully DinI-stabilized filaments (Fig. 2B). RecX concentrations up to 300 nm had small effects on filament stability as monitored by the ATPase activity. The major effects of RecX were observed as the RecX concentration was increased to 400 nm. The effect of RecX protein on ATPase activity reached a maximum at RecX concentrations of 700 nm and above. At no RecX concentration was the stabilizing effect of DinI eliminated immediately. At the highest RecX concentrations tested, the decline in RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis required about three times as long as the decline triggered by only 60 nm RecX in the absence of DinI. Nevertheless, DinI was eventually replaced if enough RecX was added, as indicated by the net disassembly of the RecA filaments. This suggests that RecX is not simply preventing RecA filament extension. RecX, at sufficiently high concentrations, is also replacing the DinI protein bound along the length of the RecA filament so as to eliminate the stabilizing effects of DinI and permit filament disassembly. The results are most economically explained by the dissociation of DinI and its replacement by RecX. Because the maximum effects of RecX in the presence of DinI are still much reduced relative to the effects of RecX in the absence of DinI, there must be a slow step in the replacement reaction that does not depend on RecX concentration. This slow step could be DinI dissociation. If the binding of DinI and RecX are mutually exclusive, the effects of RecX could not be manifested until DinI dissociated, and was then replaced by RecX.The DinI protein, when present, was preincubated with RecA in all experiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2. To determine whether competition is truly occurring between RecX and DinI, we changed the order of addition, adding DinI protein 5, 15, or 30 min after the RecX protein (Fig. 3A). In the first 5 min after RecX addition, RecA filaments are actively disassembling. Adding DinI protein at this time completely reversed the RecA filament disassembly process. The ATPase activity recovered over the course of several minutes. This suggests that DinI is not only stabilizing the RecA filaments that remain on the DNA at the moment DinI is added, but also relieving the block to RecA filament extension imposed by RecX.Fig. 3DinI can promote the recovery of RecA filaments disassembling in the presence of RecX protein. The reactions include 1.2 μm RecA protein and 2 μm M13mp8 circular ssDNA. A, the order of RecX addition is the same as in Fig. 1A but 8.4 μm DinI protein was added after the RecX protein at the time indicated parenthetically. B, an SSB displacement assay. DNA was preincubated with SSB protein for 10 min before addition of RecA and the indicated concentration of DinI protein. The concentration of NADH in the assay shown in panel B is 3 mm and does not include RecX.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When DinI is added later in the reaction (15 or 30 min after RecX), a recovery of RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis was again observed (Fig. 3A). However, the recovery was progressively slower as the time of addition of DinI was increased. Under conditions used for the experiments of Figs. 1 and 2, RecA filaments disassemble almost completely over a 20-min period (15Drees J.C. Lusetti S."

Under low serum conditions, ectopic expression of Id1, but not Id2, allowed continued proliferation of immortalized mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells. Conversely, downregulation of Id1 impaired proliferation. The effects of short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated downregulation of Id1 were the same as those following downregulation of c-Myc: decreased expression of cyclins D1 and E, reduced phosphorylation of pRb at Ser780 (a site targeted by cyclin D1-Cdk4) and reduced cyclin E-Cdk2 activity. Decreased cyclin D1 expression was an early response to Id1 antisense oligonucleotide treatment. Inhibition of c-Myc function by siRNA, antisense oligonucleotides or a dominant repressor resulted in downregulation of Id1, while ectopic expression of c-Myc resulted in rapid induction of Id1, suggesting that Id1 may be downstream of c-Myc. These data indicate that in mammary epithelial cells, Id1 has cell cycle regulatory functions that are similar to those of c-Myc, and suggest that cyclin D1 may be involved in Id1 regulation of cell cycle progression."

https://openalex.org/W2146248118,"The Tec family of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), that includes Tec, Itk, Btk, Bmx, and Txk, plays an essential role in phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) activation following antigen receptor stimulation. This function requires activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which promotes Tec membrane localization through phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns 3,4,5-P3) generation. The mechanism of negative regulation of Tec family PTKs is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the inositol 5′ phosphatases SHIP1 and SHIP2 interact preferentially with Tec, compared with other Tec family members. Four lines of evidence suggest that SHIP phosphatases are negative regulators of Tec. First, SHIP1 and SHIP2 are potent inhibitors of Tec activity. Second, inactivation of the Tec SH3 domain, which is necessary and sufficient for SHIP binding, generates a hyperactive form of Tec. Third, SHIP1 inhibits Tec membrane localization. Finally, constitutively targeting Tec to the membrane relieves SHIP1-mediated inhibition. These data suggest that SHIP phosphatases can interact with and functionally inactivate Tec by de-phosphorylation of local PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 and inhibition of Tec membrane localization.

Antigen receptor signal transduction is central to the development and function of T and B lymphocytes in generating a productive immune response. Key features of antigen receptor signaling include rapid activation of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; IL, interleukin; HA, hemagglutinin; PI and PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PLC, phospholipase C; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; SH, Src homology domain; β-gal, β-galactosidase; TCR, T cell receptor. of the Src, Syk, and Tec families, followed by their rapid inactivation to terminate the signal. The inactivation mechanisms for these PTKs have been well characterized in recent years (reviewed in Refs. 1Cannons J.L. Schwartzberg P.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 2Kurosaki T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 3Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which their actions are terminated are not well understood (4Reth M. Brummer T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 5Veillette A. Latour S. Davidson D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 669-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Since the inactivation process is rapid, it is likely that negative regulatory phosphatases are directly recruited to activated PTKs. Few such PTK-phosphatase interactions have been reported, suggesting that they may be relatively weak and transient. The Tec family of PTKs, comprising Tec, Btk, Itk, Bmx, and Txk (Rlk in mouse), perform an essential role in antigen receptor signaling of T and B lymphocytes (reviewed in Refs. 6Miller A.T. Berg L.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and 7Takesono A. Finkelstein L.D. Schwartzberg P.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tec family PTKs consist of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (not present in Txk), a proline-rich region (also termed the Tec homology domain), Src homology 3 (SH3) and SH2 domains, and a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. Tec PTKs are activated following antigen receptor cross-linking by a two-step mechanism involving phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns 3,4,5-P3) generation by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which promotes membrane targeting via the PH domain, and trans-phosphorylation by a Src family PTK, which activates the kinase domain (6Miller A.T. Berg L.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7Takesono A. Finkelstein L.D. Schwartzberg P.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of Tec family PTKs was initially realized when mutations in Btk were found to result in the human disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), in which mature B cells fail to develop (8Satterthwaite A.B. Li Z. Witte O.N. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Subsequent analyses of gene-targeted mice and cell lines have confirmed that the primary effector function for Btk and Itk is the phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) (6Miller A.T. Berg L.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7Takesono A. Finkelstein L.D. Schwartzberg P.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Satterthwaite A.B. Li Z. Witte O.N. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Btk also promotes the synthesis of the PLCγ substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, by recruiting phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases to the membrane (9Saito K. Tolias K.F. Saci A. Koon H.B. Humphries L.A. Scharenberg A. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. Carpenter C.L. Immunity. 2003; 19: 669-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). PLCγ generates the second messenger inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which promote mobilization of Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C/Ras, respectively. Together these signals induce the expression of genes that are regulated by transcription factors such as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). The mechanisms by which Tec family PTKs are inactivated are relatively poorly understood. Structural studies have lead to the hypothesis that Tec, Btk, and Itk are negatively regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the adjacent SH3 domain and proline-rich region (10Laederach A.

A number of distinct mechanisms have been reported for Btk inactivation. These include direct inhibition of Btk activity by the PH domain-interacting protein IBtk (13Liu W. Quinto I. Chen X. Palmieri C. Rabin R.L. Schwartz O.M. Nelson D.L. Scala G. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the SH3 domain-binding protein Sab (14Yamadori T. Baba Y.

In addition, Btk membrane localization can be inhibited by protein kinase C-β-mediated phosphorylation of the proline-rich region (15Kang S.W. Wahl M.I. Chu J. Kitaura J. Kawakami Y. Kato R.M.

The SHIP family of inositol phosphatases, comprising the hematopoietic cell-specific SHIP1, and the ubiquitous SHIP2, are characterized by an N-terminal SH2 domain, a central inositol phosphatase domain and a C-terminal tail containing protein interaction motifs for SH3, SH2, and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains (reviewed in Refs. 18March M.E.

SHIP phosphatases de-phosphorylate the 5 position on inositol rings of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 and inositol-(1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate (IP4). PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 is a ligand for the PH domains of Tec PTKs and several other PH domain-containing signaling proteins, and is required for membrane localization and function of Btk (16Bolland S.

SHIP phosphatases are themselves regulated by membrane targeting via binding of their SH2 domain to phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), the best characterized of which is present in the inhibitory low affinity receptor for IgG antibodies, FcγRIIB, expressed in B cells, mast cells and macrophages (18March M.E. Ravichandran K. Semin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Sly L.M. Rauh M.J. Kalesnikoff J. Buchse T. Krystal G. Exp.

The phenotypes of SHIP-deficient mice are consistent with the role of SHIP phosphatases as important negative regulators. SHIP1–/– mice die at an early age due to myeloid cell infiltration into the lungs, which is caused by enhanced signaling through a number of receptors (22Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Rosten P. Grewal R.

Nature. 2001; 409: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In the present study we have addressed the mechanism of negative regulation for Tec. Previous studies in cell lines have shown that Tec, like Btk and Itk, can function in antigen receptor signaling to activate PLCγ (25Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Analyses of Tec–/– and Btk–/–Tec–/– mice have suggested that Tec plays a relatively minor role alongside Btk in PLCγ activation in B cells (28Ellmeier W. Jung S. Sunshine M.J. Hatam F. Xu Y. Baltimore D. Mano H. Littman D.R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1611-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and in platelets (29Atkinson B.T. Ellmeier W. Watson S.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 3592-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which may be caused by its relatively low level of expression (30Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tec is believed to play a more important role in activated and Th2 effector T cells, where Tec protein is substantially up-regulated (30Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we demonstrated that Tec is unique among Tec family PTKs in its capacity to induce PLCγ1 phosphorylation and NFAT activation when overexpressed in T and B cell lines (30Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Tec is regulated in a manner that is distinct from other Tec family PTKs. Indeed, we hypothesize that Tec overexpression overcomes the effects of an endogenous Tec-specific negative regulator. The Tec SH3 domain is a candidate binding partner for such a negative regulator, because a Tec SH3 point mutant is hyperactive, unlike point mutants of other Tec domains (30Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study we have identified a novel interaction between SHIP family phosphatases and the SH3 domain of Tec, but not other family members. This interaction inhibits Tec membrane localization and effector function. Cells—The Jurkat and HUT78 T cell lines were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. The human kidney 293T cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. Plasmids—Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged SH3 domain constructs were generated by PCR from mouse Tec, isoform IV (amino acids 178–245), Btk-(212–282), and Itk-(171–238), and human Bmx-(186–297) and Txk-(82–151) cDNA (26Tomlinson M.G.

Tec family expression constructs, HA-tagged at the N terminus, have been described previously (30Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Point mutants of the Tec proline-rich region (P158A, P161A, P168A, P169A, P170A, P171A) and SH3 domain (W215L, W216L) have also been described before (30Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tec family yeast two-hybrid constructs were generated by PCR amplification of inserts followed by cloning into the pACT2 vector (BD Biosciences), in-frame with the N-terminal GAL4 activation domain. Myr-Tec was generated by PCR to replace the HA tag with the 17 N-terminal amino acids of chicken Src. Tec-GFP, tagged with GFP at the C terminus, was described previously (30Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The human SHIP1 and SHIP2 cDNAs were gifts from L. Rohrschneider (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) and S. Moodie (Metabolex Inc., Hayward, CA), respectively. SHIP1 and SHIP2 were PCR-amplified and subcloned into the pEF6 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), in-frame with the C-terminal Myc tag. Truncation mutants of full-length SHIP1, containing amino acids 1–173, 1–370, 364–1192, and 900–1192, were generated by PCR. The SHIP1 yeast two-hybrid construct was generated by PCR amplification of SHIP1 followed by cloning into the pGBT9 vector (BD Biosciences), in-frame with the N-terminal GAL4 DNA binding domain. The NFAT luciferase reporter contained three copies of the distal NFAT site from the IL-2 promoter (31Shapiro V.S. Mollenauer M.N. Greene W.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The pEF6-lacZ expression construct was from Invitrogen. Antibodies—The anti-SHIP1 rabbit antiserum was kindly provided by M. Coggeshall (University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, OK) and the anti-Tec rabbit antiserum was from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottsville, VA). The anti-HA tag mAb was 16B12 (Covance Research Products, Berkeley, CA), the anti-Myc tag mAb was 9B11 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverley, MA), and the anti-GST mAb was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-TCRβ mAb C305, for Jurkat stimulations, was described previously (32Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Biochemical Analyses—Recombinant GST-SH3 fusion proteins were made in the BL21(DE3)pLysS strain of Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). For GST pull-downs, Jurkat and HUT78 cell lysates were prepared by lysing 1 × 108 cells in 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors, precleared three times with 25 μg of GST coupled to 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. GST pull-downs were done from these lysates using 10 μg of recombinant GST-SH3 fusion protein coupled to 12.5 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. Pull-downs were washed twice with 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, twice by centrifuging through 1 ml of 1 m sucrose in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and twice more with 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by SimplyBlue Coomassie staining (Invitrogen). Protein bands were excised, the gel sliced into 1-mm square pieces and subjected to an in-gel digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) (33Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Peptides were extracted from the gel pieces and cleaned up using a gel-loader pipette tip filled with 100 nl of POROS C18 resin (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The peptide mixture was eluted into a nanospray glass capillary (Protana, Odense, Denmark) using 500 nl of 60% methanol, 5% formic acid. After mounting the capillary onto the nanospray source (Protana), peptide solutions were infused into an LCQ Classic Iontrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) at a flow rate of 10 nl/min. Individual peptide ions were isolated and subjected to MS/MS analysis using an automated “zoomscan walking” method (34Sweeney M.J. Ko B.C.B. Chung S.S.M. Turck C.W. Biomolec. Techn. 2002; 13: 43-48PubMed Google Scholar). The acquired MS/MS spectra were subjected to a non-redundant protein data base search using the SEQUEST program (Jimmy Eng and John Yates III, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (35Eng J. McCormack A.L. Yates III J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar). For GST pull-downs from SHIP-transfected 293T cells, several modifications were made to the above protocol; the preclearing and 100,000 × g centrifuge steps were omitted, the pull-down used 5 μg of recombinant GST-SH3 fusion protein, and samples were washed four times with 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were performed as previously described (36Kane L.P. Andres P.G. Howland K.C. Abbas A.K. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Western blots were visualized using Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in combination with either a Kodak Image Station (Kodak, Rochester, NY) or with Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) developed using a Compact X4 film processor (Xograph Imaging Systems, Gloucestershire, UK). Yeast Two-hybrid—Yeast media and culture conditions were as previously described (37Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), except that in synthetic media, twice the level of amino acids and nucleotides were used. The strain PJ69–4A (MATa trp1-901, leu2-3,112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, GAL2-ADE2, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, met2::GAL7-lacZ) (38James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with combinations of Gal4p activation and binding domain fusions. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed as previously described (39Heath V.L. Shaw S.L. Roy S. Cyert M.S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were grown in selective media to stationary phase, diluted to OD600 of 0.5 and spotted on to synthetic media either containing or lacking histidine. Plates were incubated for 5 days at room temperature. Transfections—Jurkat and HUT78 cells were transfected in a volume of 0.4 ml of RPMI (without serum) by electroporation using a Gene Pulser Electroporator (Bio-Rad) set at 250 V, 960 μF (Jurkat) or 240 V, 960 μF (HUT78). 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method using the CalPhos mammalian transfection kit (BD Biosciences). Luciferase Assays—Jurkat and HUT78 cells were transfected, as described above, with the expression construct of interest, in addition to 20 μg of the luciferase reporter construct and 2 μg of pEF6-lacZ to control for transfection efficiency. Sixteen hours after transfection, live cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion and samples divided for luciferase assay, β-gal assay, and Western blotting, as described (30Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All luciferase assay data were normalized to β-gal values. Expression of each construct was confirmed by Western blotting. Microscopy—Transfected Jurkat cells were sorted for Tec-GFP using a MoFlo cell sorter (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) and prepared for microscopy as described (30Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Slides were examined using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscopy system with a Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope and a 63×/1.4 NA oil objective (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) Approximately twenty fluorescence images were collected per stack (z-axis), at intervals of 0.5 microns, and calibrated to fall within the linear range of the camera. Data were presented as both mid-plane images of a single z-section and as two-dimensional projection images of all z-sections merged together. The Tec SH3 Domain Interacts with SHIP1 and SHIP2— Structural studies have lead to the hypothesis that Tec, Btk, and Itk are negatively regulated by an intramolecular interaction between the adjacent SH3 domain and proline-rich region (10Laederach A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 755-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A prediction of this model is that inactivating mutations of either the SH3 or proline-rich region would result in a hyperactive molecule. However, using a Jurkat T cell line model system to investigate this, we have found that a SH3 point mutant is more active than wild type, but that the proline mutant is not (30Tomlinson M.G. Kane L.P. Su J. Kadlecek T.A. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This suggests that the initial model is incorrect for Tec, which instead may be regulated by a novel mechanism that involves its SH3 domain interacting with a negative regulator. In order to identify a putative negative regulator, we used a proteomic approach to identify proteins that interact with recombinant GST fusion proteins of the SH3 domain of Tec. A GST fusion protein of the SH3 domain of Itk was included to enable identification of proteins that interact uniquely with Tec. GST-SH3 pull-downs were carried out using lysates of Jurkat and HUT78 T cell lines, and interacting proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1). Six protein bands that were present in Tec pull-downs, but not in control GST and GST-Tec SH3 mutant (W235L/W236L) pull-downs, were excised and identified by mass spectrometry. The cytoskeleton-related proteins α-actin, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP), and WASP-interacting protein (WIP) were found to interact with both Tec and Itk SH3 domains (Fig. 1), indicating that they are unlikely to be Tec-specific negative regulators. The identification of WASP in Itk SH3 pull-downs confirms a previous report (40Bunnell S.C. Henry P.A. Kolluri R. Kirchhausen T. Rickles R.J. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25646-25656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and is consistent with a role for Itk in regulating actin polymerization (41Labno C.M. Lewis C.M.

In contrast, dynamin (a GTPase), SOS1 (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras), ASAP1 (a GTPase-activating protein for Arf), and SHIP1 were observed to bind selectively to Tec (Fig. 1). SHIP1 is known to negatively regulate Btk membrane localization by de-phosphorylating PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 (16Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 17Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Therefore we focused on SHIP1 as a potential negative regulator of Tec. To confirm that the SH3 domain interaction with SHIP1 was specific to Tec, the samples shown in Fig. 1 were Western-blotted with a SHIP1 antiserum. SHIP1 was detected only in Tec SH3 pull-downs from HUT78 cell lysates (data not shown), which is consistent with SHIP1 expression in HUT78 but not Jurkat (42Freeburn R.W. Wright K.L. Burgess S.J. Astoul E. Cantrell D.A. Ward S.G. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5441-5450Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine whether the SH3 domains of the other Tec family PTKs could interact with SHIP1, GST-SH3 pull-downs were performed with lysates of 293T cells transiently transfected with Myc-tagged SHIP1, followed by anti-Myc Western blotting (Fig. 2A). The Tec SH3 domain interacted relatively strongly with SHIP1, confirming the observations made using HUT78 cells (Fig. 1). SHIP1 interacted relatively weakly with the Btk SH3 domain, but not with Bmx, Itk, Txk, or mutant Tec SH3 domains (Fig. 2A). To address whether a similar relationship holds for SHIP2, GST-SH3 pull-downs were performed using lysates from 293T cells transiently transfected with Myctagged SHIP2 (Fig. 2B). SHIP2 was detected relatively efficiently in Tec SH3 pull-downs, weakly in Btk SH3 pull-downs, and not at all in Bmx, Itk, Txk, or mutant Tec SH3 pull-downs (Fig. 2B). To confirm that similar quantities of each GST-SH3 fusion protein were used in these experiments, the pull-downs were Western-blotted with an anti-GST mAb (Fig. 2C). These data show that the Tec SH3 domain interacts with SHIP1 and SHIP2 more efficiently than do other Tec family SH3 domains, supporting the possibility that SHIP1 and SHIP2 selectively regulate Tec. The Tec SH3 Domain Can Interact with Two Distinct Regions of SHIP1—In order to further characterize the interaction between Tec and SHIP1, we attempted to map the SH3 binding site on SHIP1. Six canonical SH3-binding motifs with the sequence (R/K)XXPXXP or PXXPX(R/K) (where P is proline, R/K is arginine or lysine, and X is any amino acid) (43Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE8PubMed Google Scholar) are found in SHIP1 (Fig. 3A). To test whether one such site was responsible for Tec SH3 domain binding, four truncation mutants were generated (Fig. 3A) and expressed in 293T cells. Pull-downs using the Tec GST-SH3 domain fusion protei"
https://openalex.org/W2019538590,"ASPP1 and ASPP2 are both proteins that interact with p53 and enhance its ability to induce apoptosis by selectively elevating the expression of proapoptotic p53-responsive genes. iASPP(RAI) is a third member of the family that is the most conserved inhibitor of p53-mediated apoptosis. Here, we have described iASPP, a longer form of iASPP(RAI), which at 828 amino acids is more than twice the size of iASPP(RAI). Using two antibodies that recognize both iASPP and iASPP(RAI), we report that this longer form of iASPP is the predominant form of the molecule expressed in cells. Like iASPP(RAI), iASPP also binds to p53 and inhibits apoptosis induced by p53 overexpression. However, whereas iASPP(RAI) is predominantly nuclear, the N-terminus of iASPP is entirely cytoplasmic, and the longer iASPP is located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The effect upon subcellular localization of the longer N-terminus of iASPP means that this new, longer form of the molecule may be subject to greater regulation and provides another layer in the control of p53-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2082369537,"The Werner syndrome protein, WRN, is a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases. It possesses both 3′→5′ DNA helicase and 3′→5′ DNA exonuclease activities. Mutations in WRN are causally associated with a rare, recessive disorder, Werner syndrome (WS), distinguished by premature aging and genomic instability; all are reported to result in loss of protein expression. In addition to WS-linked mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, with frequencies that exceed those of WS-associated mutations, are also present in WRN. We have initiated studies to determine if six of these polymorphisms affect the enzymatic activities of WRN. We show that two common polymorphisms, F1074L and C1367R, and two infrequent polymorphisms, Q724L and S1079L, exhibit little change in activity relative to wild-type WRN; the polymorphism, T172P, shows a small but consistent reduction of activity. However, an infrequent polymorphism, R834C, located in the helicase domain dramatically reduces WRN helicase and helicase-coupled exonuclease activity. The structure of the E. coli helicase core suggests that R834 may be involved in interactions with ATP. As predicted, substitution of Arg with Cys interferes with ATP hydrolysis that is absolutely required for unwinding DNA. R834C thus represents the first missense amino acid polymorphism in WRN that nearly abolishes enzymatic activity while leaving expression largely unaffected.

R834C thus represents the first missense amino acid polymorphism in WRN that nearly abolishes enzymatic activity while leaving expression largely unaffected. Helicases are enzymes that separate the complementary strands of nucleic acids. They are ubiquitous in nature and participate in numerous nucleic acid transactions, including replication, repair, and recombination. They are classified based on their substrate preference, the presence of signature helicase motifs, and the directionality of unwinding (1Soultanas P. Wigley D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 47-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The RecQ family of DNA helicases unwinds duplex DNA with 3′→5′ polarity (the directionality being defined by the DNA strand that is bound by the helicase). The energy required for unwinding is derived from hydrolysis of ATP. The prototype of this family is the Escherichia coli RecQ protein. Prokaryotes, including E. coli, as well as lower eukaryotes have a single RecQ family member, whereas higher eukaryotes have multiple members. For example, human cells have at least five RecQ helicases: RecQ1, BLM, WRN, RecQ4, and RecQ5. The function of each of these helicases in DNA metabolic processes is conjectural. However, mutations in three of the genes, BLM, WRN, and RecQ4, are associated with Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome (WS), 1The abbreviations used are: WS, Werner syndrome; LCL, lymphocytic cell line; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).1The abbreviations used are: WS, Werner syndrome; LCL, lymphocytic cell line; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, respectively. All three disorders are characterized by genetic instability, implicating a central role of these DNA helicases in one or more DNA metabolic pathways (3Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem.

Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The WRN protein is 1432 amino acids long; its central domain has the RecQ consensus helicase motifs, I, Ia, and II–VI (5Yu C.-E. Oshima J. Fu Y.-H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S.

In vitro, purified WRN, like E. coli RecQ, exhibits DNA-dependent ATPase activity and ATP-dependent 3′→5′ DNA unwinding activity (6Gray M.D. Shen J-C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In addition, it exonucleolytically degrades DNA with 3′→5′ polarity, an activity unique to WRN among RecQ helicases (7Kamath-Loeb A.S. Shen J-C. Loeb L.A. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34145-34150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Mutations in WRN are causally associated with WS, an uncommon recessive human disease characterized by premature aging and genomic instability (8Epstein C.J. Martin G.M. Schultz A.L. Motulsky A.G. Medicine. 1966; 45: 177-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Clinical manifestations of WS, including atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, and bilateral cataracts, and an increased incidence of non-epithelial cell-derived cancers are observed in early adulthood; death commonly occurs in the fourth decade of life (8Epstein C.J. Martin G.M. Schultz A.L. Motulsky A.G. Medicine. 1966; 45: 177-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 9Goto M. Miller R.W. Ishikawa Y. Sugano H. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1996; 5: 239-246PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured cells from WS patients also exhibit reduced replicative lifespan (10Martin G.M. Sprague C.A. Epstein C.J. Lab. Invest. 1970; 23: 86-92PubMed Google Scholar) and increased genetic instability (11Fukuchi K. Martin G.M. Monnat Jr., R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genetic instability is manifested at the cytogenetic level by chromosome breaks and translocations, and at the molecular level by multiple, large DNA deletions (11Fukuchi K. Martin G.M.

Cell Genet. 1981; 30: 92-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Disease-linked mutations are found throughout the WRN gene and include stop codons, splice site variants, and insertions/deletions that generate frameshift mutations (13Moser M.J. Oshima J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Oshima J. Yu C.E. Piussan C. Klein G. Jabkowski J. Balci S. Miki T. Nakura J. Ogihara T. Ells J. Smith M.

No missense mutations in WRN have been detected in WS patients. All identified WRN mutations predict the synthesis of truncated protein products lacking the C-terminal nuclear localization signal. Based on this observation, it has been proposed that the lack of a nuclear localization signal is important in the pathogenesis of WS (16Matsumoto T. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, cell lines derived from individuals with WS have no detectable WRN (17Moser M.J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Jacob J.E. Bennett S.E. Oshima J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that WS may result from lack of WRN per se. Sequencing efforts by the genome centers at the University of Washington (egp.gs.washington.edu) and Stanford University (18Passarino G. Shen P. Van Kirk J.B. Lin A.A. De Benedictis G. Cavalli Sforza L.L. Oefner P.J. Underhill P.A. Genomics. 2001; 71: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have resulted in the identification of a large number of polymorphic amino acid substitutions in WRN. A total of 14 non-synonymous polymorphisms were reported at the time our studies were initiated. Since then, an additional six non-synonymous coding polymorphisms have been identified. Epidemiological studies have been carried out on the two most common polymorphisms, F1074L and C1367R. There are reports of an age-dependent decline of the 1074Phe/Phe genotype in both Finnish and Mexican populations, suggesting a beneficial effect of the Leu allele in aging populations (19Castro E. Edland S.D. Lee L. Ogburn C.E. Deeb S.S. Brown G. Panduro A. Riestra R. Tilvis R. Louhija J. Penttinen R. Erkkola R. Wang L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 95: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Also, the more frequent Cys allele at amino acid 1367 has been reported to be associated with a lower frequency of osteoporosis in post-menopausal Japanese women (20Ogata N. Shiraki M. Hosoi T. Koshizuka Y. Nakamura K. Kawaguichi H. J. Bone Mineral Metab. 2001; 19: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas the rarer Arg allele may be associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction in the Japanese population (21Ye L. Miki T. Nakura J. Oshima J. Kamino K. Rakugi H. Ikegami H. Higaki J. Edland S.D. Martin G.M. Ogihara T. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 68: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). No such correlative studies have been reported for any of the other WRN polymorphisms. Furthermore, neither biochemical studies nor functional analyses of any of the WRN variants have been reported. To determine whether non-synonymous coding polymorphisms in WRN affect its biochemical properties, we expressed and characterized the activities encoded by six variant proteins. We found that one polymorphism that substitutes Arg at codon 834 with Cys dramatically reduces both WRN helicase and exonuclease activities without a major effect on WRN expression. A cell line heterozygous for R834C has ∼50% of WRN helicase/exonuclease activity relative to the wild-type. Genotypic analyses of a large collection of anonymous DNA samples showed that this polymorphism is preferentially present in individuals of Spanish ancestry. The kidney epithelial tumor cell line, 293T, was grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G sulfate, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytic cell lines (LCLs) from the Polymorphism Discovery Resource collection were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository and were grown as suspension cultures in RPMI 1640 medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum and glutamine plus penicillin-streptomycin at the concentrations mentioned above. All cultures were grown in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. 293T cells were used in transient transfection assays (see below). LCLs were used to assay helicase/exonuclease activity of endogenous WRN; cells were propagated by dilution into fresh medium and harvested at densities of 1–2 × 106 cells/ml. Nucleotide changes corresponding to each polymorphic site were introduced into the WRN coding sequence using mutagenic primers and Pfu Turbo Taq DNA polymerase as summarized in the QuikChange XL-site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Where feasible, silent nucleotide alterations were also introduced into the primers to create restriction sites that facilitated easy screening of mutagenized plasmids. Following PCR amplification, the DNA was digested with DpnI to remove methylated and hemimethylated DNA. DNA resistant to DpnI cleavage was electroporated into electrocompetent XL1 Blue cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated and screened by digestion with the engineered restriction enzymes and/or fragments spanning the mutated sites sequenced to verify the presence of the nucleotide change. These fragments were sub-cloned into a non-mutagenized vector. Plasmid DNA sequence was verified again following sub-cloning. The pCS2+MT vector (22Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) was used for sub-cloning and transient transfection. Expression is driven from the strong enhancer/promoter, simian CMV IE94, and results in the synthesis of WRN with six myc epitope tags at the N terminus. The WRN cDNA clone used in the site-directed mutagenesis protocols contained the common polymorphism F1074L (frequency 0.41; egp.gs.washington.edu). Thus, all other polymorphisms were introduced in this background. The effects of these variants on WRN enzymatic activity were therefore compared with that conferred by F1074L alone. The effect of the leucine substitution was determined by replacing it with phenylalanine, the amino acid present in the remaining ∼60% of the population; this construct is referred to as wild-type. DNA encoding each of the six alleles was prepared using the Qiagen Maxi Prep DNA purification kit. The DNA was ethanol-precipitated twice; A260/A280 ratios were routinely 1.8. 293T cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding either wild-type or variant WRN. Expression of N-terminal myc epitope-tagged WRN from the plasmid is driven from the strong cytomegalovirus promoter. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 per 60-mm dish. 24 h later, 3 μg of plasmid DNA was introduced into cells by precipitation of DNA with calcium phosphate in HEPES. The medium was replaced after 12 h, and cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection. The cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. Transfected 293T cells and LCLs expressing various WRN alleles were lysed for immunoprecipitation as described previously (23Shen J-C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). WRN in lysates (500 μg of total protein) of transfected 293T cells was immunoprecipitated with a myc epitope-specific monoclonal antibody (9e10 monoclonal antibody; kindly provided by Dr. R. Monnat, University of Washington). Endogenous WRN in extracts of LCLs (500 μg of total protein) was precipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against full-length WRN (23Shen J-C.

The immunoprecipitation reactions were carried out as reported (17Moser M.J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Jacob J.E. Bennett S.E. Oshima J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); WRN-containing immune precipitates were assayed for enzymatic activities. Helicase/Exonuclease—DNA helicase/exonuclease activity was detected by the displacement and degradation of a 5′-radiolabeled 20-mer oligonucleotide from a partial duplex with a 46-mer template, as described previously (6Gray M.D. Shen J-C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Immune precipitates containing wild-type WRN were routinely used at a dilution of 1:10–1:100; unwinding and degradation were linear in this range. The dilution factor was reduced, as indicated in the figure legends, when assaying variant proteins that diminished WRN activity. Reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis through 12% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels; the extents of unwinding/degradation were quantified by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) analysis. The substrate utilized in our assays affords us the advantage of examining simultaneous unwinding and degradation of DNA; this substrate has been used extensively in our laboratory (6Gray M.D. Shen J-C.

The sequence of the 20-mer is such that its degradation products migrate anomalously in native polyacrylamide gels. Thus, the lower band represents the unwound 20-mer, whereas the upper band represents exonucleolytic products of the unwound 20-mer. This was independently confirmed from the positions of migration of heat-denatured 19/46 and 20/46 DNA substrates, wherein the 19-mer and 20-mer were 5′-radiolabeled (Fig. 1B). Because the helicase and exonuclease work coordinately (25Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44677-44687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), both bands were included in the quantitation of helicase/exonuclease activity. Activity was quantified as the ratio of products to substrate plus products in each lane. ATPase Activity—DNA-dependent ATPase activity was measured by assaying radiolabeled phosphate released from [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of single-stranded DNA (6Gray M.D. Shen J-C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Free phosphate was complexed by the addition of ammonium molybdate; the phosphomolybdenum complex was extracted with water-saturated n-butanol. Radioactivity, in aliquots of the organic phase, was monitored by liquid scintillation counting. Screening Human DNA Samples for WRN R834C—The amino acid substitution at codon 834 is the result of nucleotide substitution C → T at position 2500 in exon 21. DNA samples from 1559 healthy control individuals were genotyped to estimate the allele frequencies of R834C in various populations. The normal population included 459 Spanish individuals (i.e. from Spain, not American Hispanic), 749 Europeans of other ancestries, and 351 African-Americans. A genomic DNA PCR amplification/restriction digestion-based assay (26Walsh T. Walsh V. Vreugde S. Hertzano R. Shahin H. Haika S. Lee M.K. Kanaan M. King M-C. Avraham K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7518-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) was used to genotype R834C. The assay is based on the presence of the polymorphic site within the recognition sequence of the restriction enzyme TaqI; uncut PCR product is indicative of the presence of 2500T. A 261-bp fragment of genomic DNA was amplified with Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) using the forward primer 5′-d(TCACCAGTCCTTAATCTGTAAATCAGG)-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-d(AGGAGCACCGTAATGAATGACTTGTC)-3′. Because 2500 C → T does not alter a restriction cleavage site, the reverse primer used for PCR amplification was engineered with a C → A change at bp 2502 to generate the recognition sequence of the enzyme TaqI in the wild-type 2500C allele. Aliquots of the PCR products were digested with TaqI (New England Biolabs) at 65 °C for 2 h; cut and uncut products were resolved by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels. DNA in uncut PCR products was sequenced to verify the presence of the polymorphism. Polymorphisms are ubiquitous in the human genome, but the effects of only a few on protein function have been determined. Given the positions of the polymorphic sites within the coding sequence of WRN, we hypothesized that some of these might affect the enzymatic activities of WRN. Expression of WRN in 293T Cells—We transiently expressed myc epitope-tagged WRN in mammalian cells, immunoprecipitated, and assayed for helicase and exonuclease activities (Fig. 1A). As shown in lanes 4 and 5, antibody against the myc epitope selectively precipitated plasmid-encoded WRN, eliminating interference from endogenous WRN. In contrast, immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal WRN antibody resulted in precipitation of activity encoded by both endogenous and transiently expressed WRN (lanes 6 and 7). Therefore, all immunoprecipitation reactions with transfected cell lysates were carried out with antibody against the myc-epitope tag on WRN. Plasmid-encoded WRN levels were 50- to 100-fold higher than the level of endogenous WRN, estimated by PhosphorImager analysis of activity assays in at least five independent transfections (data not shown). Helicase/Exonuclease Activities of Variant Proteins—The six polymorphic sites we analyzed occur throughout the WRN coding sequence (Fig. 2A) and include both common and infrequent alleles. The activities of each variant protein were assayed at least in duplicate from a minimum of two independent transfections. F1074L and C1367R—F1074L is a common polymorphism (frequency 0.41) located in the vicinity of the RecQ C-terminal domain (3Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 27von Kobbe C. Bohr V.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas C1367R (frequency 0.16), is in close proximity to the nuclear localization signal (28Matsumoto T. Imamura O. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 71-76PubMed Google Scholar). Both variant proteins exhibited little change (less than 2-fold) in their helicase/exonuclease activities relative to wild-type WRN (Fig. 2, B and D). Quantitative Western blot analyses of the immunoprecipitated samples revealed that the levels of both proteins were similar to that of transfected wild-type WRN (Fig. 2, C and D). Beneficial effects of the less common alleles at both these sites have been suggested based upon an association of 1074L with age in Finnish and Mexican populations (19Castro E. Edland S.D. Lee L. Ogburn C.E. Deeb S.S. Brown G. Panduro A. Riestra R. Tilvis R. Louhija J. Penttinen R. Erkkola R. Wang L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 95: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and an association of 1367R with lower risk of myocardial infarction in the Japanese population (21Ye L. Miki T. Nakura J. Oshima J. Kamino K. Rakugi H. Ikegami H. Higaki J. Edland S.D. Martin G.M. Ogihara T. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 68: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Q724L, S1079L, and T172P—Unlike F1074L and C1367R, Q724L, S1079L, and T172P are infrequent polymorphisms with allele frequencies between 0.01 and 0.02. Q724L and S1079L are located in the helicase domain and in the vicinity of the RecQ C-terminal domain, respectively. Apparent ∼2-fold diminution of the enzymatic activities of Q724L and S1079L (Fig. 2, B and D) was paralleled by a similar -fold reduction in protein levels (Fig. 2, C and D) such that the specific activities of these variants were not significantly altered relative to control WRN. In fact, alignment of the helicase motifs of RecQ family helicases shows that E. coli RecQ and S. pombe Rqh1 have leucine at the position corresponding to Gln-724 (29Rong S.B. Valiaho J. Vihinen M. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 155-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that the leucine substitution should not significantly alter catalytic activity. The helicase/exonuclease activity of T172P was reduced 5-fold relative to that of the control (Fig. 2, B and D), whereas its level in the immune precipitate was reduced less than 2-fold (Figs. 2, C and D). Thus, the specific activity of T172P was about 3-fold lower than the control. Interestingly, in addition to the overall decrease in activity, the ratio between the 19-mer product, representing both unwinding and degradation, and the 20-mer, representing unwinding alone, was altered by the T172P substitution (compare lanes F1074L in Figs. 2B and 4A and lanes T172P in Fig. 2B). The relative preponderance of the unwound 20-mer suggests that T172P may also be defective in degrading DNA and/or coupling degradation to unwinding. This is plausible because Thr-172 maps to the exonuclease domain (Fig. 2A). Although a 3-fold reduction in enzymatic activity is a small effect and may not be causal for the development of WS, this polymorphism could affect cellular phenotypes in specific genetic backgrounds and from as yet unappreciated functions of WRN. A heterozygous allele frequency of 0.02 represents a large number of individuals. R834C—R834C is also an infrequent polymorphism located in the central helicase core of WRN. Alignment of the helicase domains of RecQ helicases from bacteria, yeast, plants, mouse, and humans shows that arginine at the position equivalent to Arg-834 in WRN is invariant (30Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), implying that it is important for function. We genotyped more than 1500 DNA samples obtained from anonymous donors of known ethnic origins for this polymorphism. R834C was identified in 7 of 459 persons of Spanish ancestry (Fig. 3), with 6 heterozygotes and 1 homozygote being verified by DNA sequencing (not shown). The heterozygous frequency of the 834C allele in this population sample of Spanish ancestry was ∼0.007. Interestingly, the R834C variant was not found in 749 individuals of various other European ancestries nor among 351 African-Americans. Effects of R834C on Helicase/Exonuclease Activities—R834C WRN exhibited a dramatic and reproducible reduction of both helicase and exonuclease activities compared with wild type WRN (Fig. 2, B and D). Five independent transfections and multiple measurements of activity yielded essentially identical results. Only trace amounts of unwinding/degradation were evident even when amounts in excess of 100-fold that of wild-type WRN were used. Quantification, by serial dilution of immune precipitates containing R834C WRN, revealed that the activity was reduced ∼40–50-fold relative to the control, F1074L (Fig. 4A). To ensure that there was no degradation of the substrate independent of unwinding, we electrophoresed reaction aliquots displayed in Fig. 4A through a 14% ureapolyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4B). As observed and quantified, there was a good correlation in the -fold reduction of exonuclease calculated from the native gel (top band of doublet) and the denaturing gel, indicating that, at least with this substrate, exonucleolytic degradation is coupled to unwinding. Because R834C maps to the helicase domain, we monitored its helicase activity independent of exonuclease activity. The helicase was uncoupled from the exonuclease by use of a 3′-end-blocked DNA substrate. The 20-mer oligonucleotide was modified to contain an inverted 3′-3′ link between the terminal and penultimate nucleotides; a partial duplex of the blocked 20-mer/46-mer is refractory to the 3′→5′ exonuclease activity of WRN. By using this substrate, we observed that, as in the case of the unmodified substrate, the helicase activity of R834C WRN was reduced 40- to 50-fold relative to that of the control (Fig. 4C). Two independent plasmid DNA sub-clones containing the R834C substitution showed similar losses of WRN enzymatic activities, eliminating the possibility that a secondary alteration might be responsible for the deficiency. Furthermore, normalizing WRN activity to the activity encoded by a cotransfected LacZ plasmid yielded the same result (not shown), negating the possibility that a difference in transfection efficiency accounted for the major difference in R834C activity. Quantitative immunoblot analyses revealed that, in contrast to the large reduction of enzymatic activity, the level of R834C WRN was reduced less than 2-fold compared with the control (Fig. 2, C and D). These observations imply that the predominant effect of the R834C substitution is to alter WRN activity rather than protein expression. Analysis of R834C WRN in Cultured Human LCLs—R834C was identified in DNA from the Polymorphism Discovery Resource data base (egp.gs.washington.edu). To analyze R834C WRN activity when expressed from its natural promoter, we examined WRN helicase/exonuclease activity in lymphocytic cell lines established from anonymous donors. One individual out of 90 was heterozygous for R834C; this donor was also heterozygous for F1074L and C1367R. Therefore, we compared WRN activity in this cell line to lines derived from six donors, three that had wild-type WRN, two donors that were heterozygous for F1074L WRN, and one individual that was heterozygous for C1367R WRN. We immunoprecipitated endogenous WRN from high salt lysates of lymphocytes with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the full-length protein, and assayed the immune precipitates for helicase/exonuclease activity (Fig. 5A). As observed in the transient transfection experiments (Fig. 2), cells heterozygous for F1074L or C1367R had activities essentially similar to those of wild-type WRN. However, multiple measurements with four independently prepared and immunoprecipitated lysates showed that cells that were also heterozygous for R834C had an average 42% of the helicase/exonuclease activity exhibited by controls (Fig. 5A). Quantitative Western blot analyses, using β-actin as an internal control, showed that the level of WRN in R834C heterozygous cells was ∼90% that of the average WRN level in three wild-type cell lines (Fig. 5B). This is consistent with our measurements of R834C WRN levels in transfected cell lysates (Fig. 2, C and D) and further supports the notion that the R834C polymorphism predominantly affects activity rather than expression of WRN. Whereas WS cells lack detectable WRN enzymatic activity, cells heterozygous for WRN have half as much helicase/exonuclease activity (17Moser M.J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Jacob J.E. Bennett S.E. Oshima J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this respect, cells heterozygous for R834C are similar to bona fide WS heterozygous cells in which wild-type WRN is the predominant, if not the only, functional allele. An important difference between WS-associated mutations and the R834C polymorphism, however, is that the former are invariably nonsense or frameshift mutations resulting in truncated WRN protein that is undetectable intracellularly (17Moser M.J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Jacob J.E. Bennett S.E. Oshima J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 648-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas R834C is a missense substitution that has minimal effect on WRN levels. R834C represents the first naturally occurring missense amino acid substitution in WRN that markedly decreases helicase and helicase-coupled exonuclease activities. ATPase Activity of R834C WRN—Because unwinding of DNA is absolutely dependent on ATP (31Matson S.W. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 40: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we determined if ATP hydrolysis by R834C WRN is diminished. Immune precipitates prepared from cells transfected with vector lacking WRN, or containing F1074L or R834C WRN, were assayed for DNA-dependent ATPase activity, as shown in Fig. 6A. Whereas immune precipitates containing F1074L exhibited robust ATP hydrolysis, ATP hydrolysis by R834C WRN was decreased as much as 10-fold. We conclude that the diminished ATPase activity conferred by the R834C substitution could account, at least in part, for the diminished helicase activity of this variant protein. A recently published high resolution structure of the prototypical E. coli RecQ helicase core (30Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) has revealed that the helicase region comprises two distinct domains separated by a deep cleft. Conserved helicase motifs line the walls of the cleft implying the importance of these motifs in DNA unwinding. Further, a co-crystal structure of RecQ and ATPγS has enabled the identification of the ATP binding site. Based on the published structure, we deduced the following (Fig. 6B): (i) Arg-306 (corresponding to Arg-834 in WRN) forms two side chain hydrogen bonds with Asp-330; (ii) Asp-330 has backbone contacts with Arg-329, closely packed between the two domains and the only residue in domain 2 that is in close enough proximity to ATPγS to permit hydrogen bonding with it, and (iii) the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-325 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Arg-329 to further position it near the ATP. Arg-306, Asp-330, and Arg-329 are invariant among 65 bacterial RecQ helicases and are conserved in WRN (30Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are critical to helicase function. Substitution of Arg-306 with cysteine (as occurs in WRN R834C) would disrupt the hydrogen bond interactions with Asp-330 (Fig. 6C). When the interactions between Arg-306 and Asp-330 are disabled, Arg-329 may be no longer oriented appropriately to interact with, and facilitate hydrolysis of ATP. Thus, by analogy to E. coli RecQ, substitution of Arg-834 in human WRN with cysteine could interfere with ATP hydrolysis, an absolute requirement for helicase activity. In fact, this is what we observed (Fig. 6A). As observed with WS, most of the mutations associated with Bloom syndrome truncate the protein and result in lack of detectable BLM protein (29Rong S.B. Valiaho J. Vihinen M. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 155-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike WS, at least six missense substitutions have been linked to Bloom syndrome (29Rong S.B. Valiaho J. Vihinen M. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 155-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four of these map to the helicase domain, and three were shown to abolish both helicase and ATPase activities (32Bahr A. De Graeve F. Kedinger C. Chatton B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2565-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that defects in these functions may be primarily responsible for conferring Bloom syndrome phenotypes. The analogy with Bloom syndrome supports the possibility that individuals who are homozygous for the WRN 834C allele could exhibit some of the phenotypes associated with Werner syndrome, including an elevated risk of unusual cancers and early onset of atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, bilateral cataracts, and osteoporosis. In summary, we report that an infrequent polymorphism that encodes an R834C substitution in the WS protein results in marked diminution of helicase and helicase-coupled exonuclease activity without affecting protein expression. Diminution of activity was established by immunoprecipitation of R834C WRN from transiently transfected mammalian cells and from lymphoblast cells heterozygous for this allele. We inferred, from the structure of the E. coli RecQ helicase core, that the Arg to Cys substitution could interfere with ATP binding and thus, ATP hydrolysis. In fact, we present evidence to support this. Future studies should help determine whether the decrease in the enzymatic activities of R834C WRN can be correlated with the occurrence of specific phenotypes, some of which could overlap with those associated with WS, namely, genomic instability or accelerated aging. We thank Drs. Ann Blank, Michael Fry, and Mary-Claire King for critical reading of the manuscript and members of the Loeb laboratory for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2012047843,"CCN1 is an angiogenic factor that promotes cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. CCN1-deficient mice suffer embryonic death because of vascular defects, demonstrating that CCN1 is required for vessel development. Because mechanical stretch may act as a trigger for vessel development, we investigated the impact of mechanical stretch on the regulatory mechanism of CCN1 expression. Mechanical stretch rapidly enhances CCN1 expression and release in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in vitro and CCN1 expression in murine aortic segments in vivo. Transfection experiments of VSMC with deletion constructs of the CCN1 promoter revealed the regulatory region responsible for the stretch-induced CCN1 expression in the ∼200-bp promoter region upstream of the TATA-box containing potential binding sites for early growth response-1 (Egr-1), nuclear factor of activated T-cells and cAMP response element binding protein. Decoy oligonucleotides to Egr-1, but not to nuclear factor of activated T-cells or cAMP response element binding protein, abolished the stretch-induced transcription of CCN1. In addition, mutagenesis of the Egr-1 binding site within the CCN1 promoter completely blunted the stretch-induced activation of the promoter. Furthermore, mechanical stretch induced the expression and DNA-binding activity of Egr-1 in VSMC as demonstrated by Western blot and electromobility shift assay. Moreover, a pressure overload-dependent de novo synthesis of Egr-1 was observed after aortic banding. These findings indicate that mechanical stretch leads to enhanced expression of CCN1 via the mechanosensitive transcription factor Egr-1, suggesting a central role for mechanical stretch in the regulation of CCN1-dependent pro-angiogenic potency.

CCN1 (formerly known as CYR61) is a cysteine-rich heparin-binding protein that is encoded by an immediate early gene and belongs to the novel CCN gene family (connective tissue growth factor (CTGF); cysteine-rich angiogenic protein 61 (CYR61); nephroblastoma overexpressed (Nov) (1Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The expression of CCN1 is rapidly and transiently induced in response to growth factors (2O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). CCN1 is expressed by all types of vascular cells and is associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM). 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; TAC, transverse aortic constriction; RT, reverse transcriptase; ODN, oligonucleotide; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; SMC, smooth muscle cell; Egr-1, early growth response-1.1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; TAC, transverse aortic constriction; RT, reverse transcriptase; ODN, oligonucleotide; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; SMC, smooth muscle cell; Egr-1, early growth response-1. CCN1 mediates cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and neovascularization through cell-type specific binding to different integrins (1Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that CCN1-deficient mice suffer embryonic death because of placental vascular insufficiency and compromised vessel integrity. The knockout is further characterized by a specific defect in vessel bifurcation development and an impaired expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (3Mo F.E. Muntean A.G. Chen C.C. Stolz D.B. Watkins S.C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8709-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). These observations point to CCN1 as a novel and essential regulator of vessel development. In addition, recombinant CCN1 protein was shown to induce genes involved in angiogenesis, inflammation, ECM remodeling, and cell-matrix interactions (4Chen C.C. Mo F.E. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47329-47337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Besides its ability to promote tumor growth, enhanced CCN1 expression has been associated with pathophysiological settings in atherosclerotic plaques and in neointima formation after vascular injury by balloon angioplasty (5Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 6Hilfiker A. Hilfiker-Kleiner D. Fuchs M. Kaminski K.

A common feature of these conditions is an augmented mechanical stress within the vessel wall, primarily sensed by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) as one of the main sources of CCN1 synthesis. In this regard, maladaptive remodeling of the vessel wall is a characteristic feature of vascular diseases such as arterial hypertension or atherosclerosis and seems to involve vasoactive peptides (e.g. angiotensin II) (9Naftilan A.J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1994; 3: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and mechanical stretch (10Dzau V.J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1993; 2: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism by which mechanical stretch is linked to angiogenesis. Recent observations by our group that pointed to mechanical stretch as a critical regulator of vessel remodeling (11Grote K. Flach I. Luchtefeld M. Akin E. Holland S.M. Drexler H. Schieffer B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: E80-E86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) led us to investigate the regulation of the CCN1 expression by mechanical stretch as a possible trigger mechanism for pro-angiogenic effects. To analyze expression, release, and transcriptional regulation of CCN1, mechanical stretch was applied to cultured VSMC in vitro by using the Flexercell Strain Unit. The role of increased vascular stretch on CCN1 expression in vivo was achieved by inducing pressure overload by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice. Cell Culture—Murine aortic VSMC were isolated from C57BL/6 mice by enzymatic dispersion as described previously (12Blank R.S. Thompson M.M. Owens G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biochrom) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were growth-arrested in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 48 h before use, experiments were performed under serum-free conditions. Mechanical Stretch—VSMC were plated on 6-well silicone elastomer plates coated with collagen type I (Bioflex; Flexcell, Hillsborough, NC). The cells were exposed to continuous cycles of stretch and relaxation (0.5 Hz) by use of the Flexercell Strain Unit FX-3000 (Flexcell) for the indicated times; a maximum of 15% radial stretch of the membrane was applied. Transverse Aortic Constriction (TAC)—Twelve-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were sedated with propofol (10 mg/kg, i.v.), anesthetized with 3% isoflurane, and connected to a rodent ventilator (Harvard, Holliston, MA). Transverse aortic constriction was performed between the left and right carotid arteries. Expression levels in pressure overload segments proximal to the site of constriction were compared with expression levels in distal control segments. Arterial blood pressure recordings were obtained using a 1.4 farad micromanometer conductance catheter (Millar Instruments, Houston, TX) inserted via the right carotid artery as described previously (13Fuchs M. Hilfiker A. Kaminski K. Hilfiker-Kleiner D. Guener Z. Klein G. Podewski E. Schieffer B. Rose-John S. Drexler H. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2118-2120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TAC-operated mice exhibited a significant increase in left ventricular systolic pressure (167 ± 23 mm Hg) versus sham-operated mice (123 ± 7 mm Hg). Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA from VSMC exposed to mechanical stretch was isolated using TriFast-Reagent (peqLAB, Erlangen, Germany). Total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript reverse transcriptase (RT) (Invitrogen), oligo(dT) primers and deoxynucleoside triphosphates. The RT products were amplified using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR for CCN1 was carried out for 26 cycles (forward primer, 5′-CAA CCC TGC GAC CAC AC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGC CCT TTT TTA GGC TGC-3′, 643 bp) and normalized to the expression of the 18 S rRNA (18 cycles, forward primer, 5′-CCT GCG GCT TAA TTT GAC TC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGC CTC ACT AAA CCA TCC AA-3′, 510 bp) using oligonucleotides obtained from MWGBiotech (Ebersberg, Germany). PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified densitometrically using a Gel Doc image analysis system (Bio-Rad). Western Blotting—Protein extracts (30 μg) were separated by denaturing SDS (10%) PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Transferred proteins were probed with a goat polyclonal anti-CCN1 antibody (1:1000) or with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Egr-1 antibody (1:5000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and visualized using a horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary anti-goat (1:3000; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) or an anti-rabbit (1:3000; Amersham Biosciences) antibody and ECL solution. Equal protein loading was verified by reprobing the membrane with a mouse monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle cell actin antibody (α-SMC actin; Sigma-Aldrich). Immunohistochemistry—Serial cryostat sections were used for immunohistochemical analysis. After blocking endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2/phosphate-buffered saline, sections were incubated with 4% blocking serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were stained with a goat polyclonal CCN1 antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a mouse monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle cell actin antibody (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich). Incubation with primary antibody was followed by application of the biotin conjugated second antibody (1:200), containing 4% species-appropiate normal serum and the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase-complex (Vector Laboratories). The final reaction was visualized with either diaminobenzidine or 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (DakoCytomation, Hamburg, Germany), followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). Promoter Luciferase Assay—A 2.0-kb fragment of the mouse CCN1 gene promoter (full length, -2062 to +1; GenBank accession number X56790) was cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic (Invitrogen) at the KpnI/NheI-site by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Promega). Serial 5′-deletion constructs of the CCN1 promoter at position -1561 (del1), -1032 (del2), -512 (del3), -262 (del4), and -32 (TATABox) were also produced by PCR and restriction enzyme digestions. Two different constructs with point-mutations in the Egr-1 binding site of the full-length CCN1 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic were produced using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) and the specific primers Egr-1 (mut1) (sense, 5′-CGT CAC TGC AAC ACG CTA CGC CTA GGC AGG C-3′) and Egr-1 (mut2) (sense, 5′-CGT CAC TGC AAC ACG CGG ATC CTA GGC AGG C-3′) (underlined sequence denote the CCN1 promoter-specific Egr-1 binding site; substituted nucleotides are bold). VSMC were plated on 6-well Bioflex plates and transiently transfected with 2 μg/well of the different CCN1 promoter/pGL3 constructs using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. VSMC were subjected to stretch regimes for 24 h. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to whole protein content, quantified and expressed as relative luciferase light units using a luminometer (Lumat; Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Potential responsive elements within the CCN1 promoter were determined using the TRANSFAC data base (14Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H. Liebich I. Matys V. Meinhardt T. Pruss M. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts from cultured VSMC exposed to mechanical stretch were isolated, and nondenaturing 4% acrylamide containing PAGE was performed as described previously (15Bavendiek U. Libby P. Kilbride M. Reynolds R. Mackman N. Schon-beck U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25032-25039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Double-stranded gel shift oligonucleotides for Egr-1 (sense, 5′-CCC GGC GCG GGG GCG ATT TCG AGT CA-3′; underlined sequence denotes the Egr-1 consensus binding site) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 kinase and incubated with nuclear extracts (10 μg) for 30 min at ambient temperature. The specificity of the Egr-1 gel-shift oligonucleotide was tested by using a 50-fold excess of the unlabeled competitive oligonucleotide and a labeled unspecific noncompetitive hypoxia-inducible factor-1α oligonucleotide and by supershift analyses using an anti-Egr-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Decoy ODN Technique—Double-stranded decoy oligonucleotides (ODN) containing the conserved promoter-binding site of NFAT, CREB, Egr-1, and a scrambled sequence were prepared from complementary single-stranded phosphorothioate-bonded ODN obtained from EUROGENTEC (Köln, Germany) by melting at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by a cool-down phase over night. The efficiency of the hybridization reaction was controlled in 2.5% agarose gels and was almost 100%. Decoy ODN were added in 2.5 μm concentration to the cell culture supernatant and incubated for 4 h. The single-stranded sequences of the decoy ODN were as follows (* denotes the phosphorothioate bonds; underlined sequences denote the transcription factor binding sites): NFAT (consensus): sense, 5′-T*, C*, T*, AAA GTG GAG GAA AAT TTG GAA*, C*, T*, C-3′; CREB (consensus): sense, 5′-A*, G*, A*, GAT TGC CTG ACG TCA GAG AGC*, T*, A*, G-3′; Egr-1 (consensus): sense, 5′-C*, C*, C*, GGC GCG GGG GCG ATT TCG AG*, T*, C*, A-3′; Egr-1 (CCN1-specific), 5′-G*, C*, A*, ACA CGC GGC GCC TAG GCA GG*, C*, A*, T-3′; and scrambled: sense, 5′-A*, A*, C*, AGA AGC CAG GAA CCC TCC*, T*, C*, T-3′. Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as mean ± S.E. of at least four independent experiments. Differences were evaluated by analysis of variance. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Mechanical Stretch Enhances CCN1 Expression and Release by Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells in Vitro—Mechanical stretch rapidly enhanced CCN1 mRNA expression in cultured VSMC with a peak at 0.5 h (1.9 ± 0.4-fold) and 1 h (2.1 ± 0.5-fold) declining after 24 h of mechanical stretch (Fig. 1A). Mechanical stretch of VSMC enhanced CCN1 protein expression after the CCN1 mRNA expression with a delayed kinetic. CCN1 protein expression in cell lysates was transiently increased at 1 h (2.2 ± 0.2-fold) and 3 h (2.1 ± 0.3-fold), and reached expression levels of the unstretched control thereafter (Fig. 1B). It is noteworthy that mechanical stretch induced the release of CCN1 protein into the supernatant of cultured VSMC (∼10 ± 4-fold at 1 and 3 h; ∼20 ± 7-fold at 6 and 24 h) (Fig. 1C). Pressure Overload Enhances CCN1 Expression in Vivo—CCN1 mRNA expression was found to be up-regulated in aortic segments exposed to pressure overload after aortic banding (overload) at 0.5 h (2.4 ± 0.5-fold) and at 1 h (1.9 ± 0.3-fold) compared with control segments (Fig. 2A). Mechanical stretch in vivo also resulted in an increased expression of the CCN1 protein. OCT-embedded aortic tissue rings of pressure overload segments revealed an enhanced CCN1 staining 6 h after TAC in the medial layer of the aorta verified by staining for α-SMC actin compared with control segments. Unspecific IgG showed no staining in these sections (Fig. 2B). Enhanced CCN1 staining was already observed 3 h after TAC and still enhanced after 24 h. Sham operation did not enhance CCN1 protein expression (data not shown). Mechanical Stretch Up-regulates CCN1 Promoter Activity by the Transcription Factor Egr-1—According to TRANSFAC analysis (14Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H. Liebich I. Matys V. Meinhardt T. Pruss M. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), the promoter of the mouse CCN1 gene (GenBank accession number X56790) contains several putative binding sites for transcription factors (e.g. activator protein-1, NFAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription, Egr-1, etc.) (Fig. 3A). To investigate the transcriptional regulation of the CCN1 gene by mechanical stretch in VSMC, the full-length CCN1 promoter was cloned into the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic. To identify promoter regions sensitive to mechanical stretch, we performed transfection studies employing 5′-deletion constructs of the CCN1 promoter (del1, del2, del3, and del4). Cultured VSMC transfected with the different CCN1 promoter constructs were subsequently stretched and assayed for luciferase activity. All reporter constructs employed resulted in a strong stretch-induced luciferase activity (9-10-fold) compared with unstretched VSMC (Fig. 3B). No loss of luciferase activity was observed employing 5′-deletion constructs deleted up to bp -262 of the CCN1 promoter compared with the full-length construct. In contrast, the use of a construct containing the 30 bp of the CCN1 promoter including the TATA-box (bp -32 to +1) led to a complete loss of luciferase activity, indicating that the regulatory elements responsible for the induction of the CCN1 promoter by mechanical stretch are located in the promoter region downstream of position -262 (= del4). Putative binding sites for transcription factors in the remaining region are NFAT (bp -212 to -201), CREB (bp -63 to -56), and Egr-1 (bp -48 to -41). Using neutralizing consensus decoy ODN against these transcription factors revealed that only the decoy ODN against Egr-1 abolished the up-regulation of CCN1 mRNA by mechanical stretch (1.3 ± 0.2-fold versus 2.8 ± 0.3), which is shown in Fig. 3C. Likewise, a decoy ODN against the CCN-1 promoter-specific Egr-1 binding site abolished stretch-induced CCN1 mRNA expression (1.25 ± 0.2-fold versus 2.8 ± 0.3-fold), demonstrating the specific binding of Egr-1 to the CCN1 promoter after mechanical stretch. NFAT, CREB, and scrambled ODN had no inhibitory effect on CCN1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3C). In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of the Egr-1 binding site in the CCN1 promoter was performed to further demonstrate the impact of Egr-1 on the stretch-induced CCN1 expression. Two different substitutions in the Egr-1 binding site were generated based on the full-length CCN1 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (Egr-1/mut1, GG→ TA; Egr-1/mut2, CG→ AT). Cultured VSMC transfected with the different CCN1 promoter constructs were subsequently stretched and assayed for luciferase activity. As expected, the full-length reporter constructs resulted in a strong stretch-induced luciferase activity (9.5-fold) compared with unstretched VSMC, whereas both Egr-1/mut1 and Egr-1/mut2 reporter constructs showed completely abrogated stretch-induced luciferase activity (Fig. 3D). Mechanical Stretch Enhances Egr-1 Activation in Vitro and in Vivo—To confirm the role of Egr-1 in the stretch-dependent regulation of the CCN1 gene promoter, Egr-1 de novo synthesis by mechanical stretch was investigated by Western blotting. Mechanical stretch of VSMC enhanced Egr-1 protein expression at 0.5 h (1.9 ± 0.3-fold), peaked at 1 h (2.5 ± 0.5-fold), and declined thereafter (Fig. 4A). In addition, Egr-1 translocation and DNA-binding after mechanical stretch was investigated in gel shift experiments. Mechanical stretch-induced Egr-1 activation in VSMC was already detectable at 15 min (7-fold) and peaked at 30 min (10-fold) (Fig. 4B). The DNA/protein complex was displaced by a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitive Egr-1 oligonucleotides, not influenced by a 50-fold molar excess of labeled unspecific noncompetitive hypoxia-inducible factor-1α oligonucleotides, and supershifted in the presence of an anti-Egr-1 antibody, showing the specificity of the detected complex. In addition, pressure overload-induced mechanical stretch in vivo increased the de novo-synthesis of Egr-1 protein. Therefore, Egr-1 protein expression was investigated after TAC by Western blotting and was found to be up-regulated in the aortic segments exposed to pressure overload peaks at 30 min (2.7 ± 0.6-fold) compared with control segments (Fig. 4C). Sham-operation did not enhance Egr-1 protein expression (data not shown). The present study demonstrates that mechanical stretch enhances the expression and release of the angiogenic factor CCN1 from smooth muscle cells in vitro. Moreover, we demonstrated in this study that CCN1 expression in vivo is induced in vascular segments exposed to pressure overload and that the induction of CCN1 expression is mediated by the mechanosensitive activation of the transcription factor Egr-1. Maladaptive remodeling of the vessel wall is a characteristic feature of vascular diseases such as arterial hypertension or atherosclerosis and seems to involve vasoactive peptides (e.g. angiotensin II (9Naftilan A.J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1994; 3: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) and mechanical stretch (10Dzau V.J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1993; 2: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Among a variety of pathophysiological settings such as excessive pulmonary ventilation and bladder-obstructive disorders, mechanical stretch plays a major role in triggering maladaptive mechanisms (e.g. abnormal ECM deposition), especially involving smooth muscle cells (16Wyncoll D.L. Evans T.W. Lancet. 1999; 354: 497-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Brading A.F. Scand. J. Urol. Nephrol. Suppl. 1997; 184: 51-58PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism by which mechanical stretch is linked to angiogenesis. In this regard, CCN1 was first reported by Lau and colleagues as a growth factor-inducible immediate early gene associated with the ECM (2O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 18Latinkic B.V. O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3261-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CCN1 was associated with cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell proliferation of vascular cells. Thereafter, CCN1 was shown to induce neovascularization in the rat cornea model through cell-type-specific binding to different integrins (1Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 5Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). These observations suggest an important role of CCN1 in vascular remodeling and angiogenesis. Beside the direct effect of CCN1 on various cells of the vessel wall, recombinant CCN1 protein induces a genetic program that contributes to angiogenesis, inflammation, remodeling, and cell-matrix interactions (4Chen C.C. Mo F.E. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47329-47337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In fact, the essential role of CCN1 in vessel development was recently demonstrated in the CCN1 knock-out mouse suffering from embryonic death because of impaired placental development and vascular integrity. CCN1 deficiency results in a specific defect in vessel bifurcation development, leading to a disordered vascularization of the placenta, which is correlated with impaired vascular endothelial growth factor-C expression (3Mo F.E. Muntean A.G. Chen C.C. Stolz D.B. Watkins S.C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8709-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). These observations established CCN1 as an essential regulator of vascular development. Genes involved in differentiation and angiogenesis such as vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet derived growth factor have been shown to be up-regulated by mechanical stretch in smooth muscle cells pointing to the important impact of mechanical stretch on vessel development (19Smith J.D. Davies N. Willis A.I. Sumpio B.E. Zilla P. Endothelium. 2001; 8: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Wilson E. Mai Q. Sudhir K. Weiss R.H. Ives H.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). CCN1 was first linked to augmented mechanical stretch by the observation that its expression is up-regulated under pathophysiological conditions (e.g. after balloon angioplasty or outlet obstructed bladders (7Wu K.J. Yee A. Zhu N.L. Gordon E.M. Hall F.L. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 433-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Lindner V. Chen N. Lam S.C. Lau L.F. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Chaqour B. Whitbeck C. Han J.S. Macarak E. Horan P. Chichester P. Levin R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E765-E774Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Herein, we first demonstrated that mechanical stretch induces a fast and transient up-regulation of the CCN1 mRNA (maximum at 0.5 and 1 h) and protein expression (maximum at 1 and 3 h) in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. In addition, we could show that the CCN1 protein, which contains an N-terminal secretory signal peptide, is released by VSMC in response to mechanical stretch. The time-dependent CCN1 release follows the intracellular CCN1 protein expression with a delayed kinetic and accumulates after 6 and 24 h of mechanical stretch. The fact that only small amounts of CCN1 are detectable in the supernatant of quiescent VSMC may be attributed to a minor release under resting conditions suggesting an important role of mechanical stretch in the induction of CCN1-dependent effects in the vessel. However, the new finding suggests that stretch-dependent CCN1 release may act as an essential trigger mechanism for the biological function of this ECM associated protein. To induce elevated mechanical stretch in vivo, we used the murine aortic banding model. This technique was first established to mimic pressure overload in the heart (22Rockman H.A. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U. Steinhelper M.E. Field L.J. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8277-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). To investigate stretch-dependent CCN1 expression in vivo, we compared aorta segments exposed to pressure overload proximal to the aortic stenosis with control segments located distal of the stenosis. We here show that pressure overload enhances both the vascular mRNA and protein expression of CCN1, supporting the notion that enhanced mechanical stretch in vivo may trigger the CCN1 expression. Recently Tamura et al. (23Tamura I. Rosenbloom J. Macarak E. Chaqour B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1524-C1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that mechanical stretch enhanced CCN1 expression in fetal bovine bladder smooth muscle cells involves protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Rho-kinase, and the actin cytoskeleton. In this regard the transcriptional regulation of CCN1 remained unclear. Latinkic et al. (18Latinkic B.V. O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3261-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrated that serum enhanced CCN1 promoter activation in murine fibroblasts depends on a serum responsive element (SRE). Furthermore, Han et al. reported a CREB and AP-1 dependent activation of the differently organized human CCN1 promoter in bladder smooth muscle cells by sphingosine 1-phosphate (24Han J.S. Macarak E. Rosenbloom J. Chung K.C. Chaqour B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3408-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here we addressed the activation of mechano-sensitive transcription factors linking mechanical stretch of VSMC to CCN1 promoter activation. We observed that mechanical stretch-induced CCN1 expression is regulated by a single binding site for Egr-1. In contrast to the previously described SRE which is located ∼2 kb (bp -1912 to -1933) upstream of the transcription start the novel stretch responsive element identified in this study is located directly in front of the TATA-box in the CCN1 promoter (bp -48 to -41). Egr-1 is a zinc finger transcription factor first identified because of its characteristic immediate-early expression pattern during growth and differentiation (25Sukhatme V.P. Cao X.M. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C.H. Stamenkovich D. Ferreira P.C. Cohen D.R. Edwards S.A. Shows T.B. Curran T. et al.Cell. 1988; 53: 37-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). In addition, Egr-1 regulates the expression of genes known to be important for differentiation and angiogenesis, the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor Flt-1 (26Akuzawa N. Kurabayashi M. Ohyama Y. Arai M. Nagai R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the messenger RNA of Egr-1 was found to be up-regulated in pressure overloaded rat hearts linking Egr-1 to elevated wall stress in left ventricle hypertrophy (27Schunkert H. Weinberg E.O. Bruckschlegel G. Riegger A.J. Lorell B.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 2768-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, the ability of mechanical stretch to increase Egr-1 transcript levels was demonstrated in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (28Stula M. Orzechowski H.D. Gschwend S. Vetter R. von Harsdorf R. Dietz R. Paul M Mol. Cell Biochem. 2000; 210: 101-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Morawietz H. Ma Y.H. Vives F. Wilson E. Sukhatme V.P. Holtz J. Ives H.E. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 678-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is likely that the SRE acts as a regulatory element important for the basal activity of the CCN1 promoter, whereas Egr-1 binding is important for enhanced CCN1 promoter activity under certain conditions, e.g. during differentiation and angiogenesis, potentially in response to enhanced mechanical stretch. As mentioned previously, stretch enhanced CCN1 expression in bladder smooth muscle cells involves the protein kinase C/PI3K/Rho-kinase signaling pathway (23Tamura I. Rosenbloom J. Macarak E. Chaqour B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1524-C1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of this pathway abrogates Egr-1 expression and activity (30Inuzuka H. Nanbu-Wakao R. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M. Tojo H. Wakao H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Guillemot L. Levy A. Raymondjean M. Rothhut B. J. Biol.

Res. 2004; 95: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) providing the possibility of an involvement of the protein kinase C/PI3K/Rhokinase signaling pathway on the stretch dependent activation of Egr-1. Furthermore, Yamaguchi et al. (30Inuzuka H. Nanbu-Wakao R. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M. Tojo H. Wakao H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) reported that stretch-dependent Egr-1 activation enhances the expression of membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase in rat microvascular endothelial cells with a significant impact on angiogenesis by affecting the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2. In this regard, we recently demonstrated that mechanical stretch enhances expression and release of matrix metalloproteinase-2 in a redox-sensitive manner (11Grote K. Flach I. Luchtefeld M. Akin E. Holland S.M. Drexler H. Schieffer B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: E80-E86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we could show that mechanical stretch enhances the angiogenic factor CCN1 via the activation of the mechanosensitive transcription factor Egr-1. These findings suggest a central role for mechanical stretch in the regulation of CCN1-dependent functions in angiogenesis, cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation.

In this study, we generated Mail–/– mice to investigate the roles of MAIL in whole organisms. Mail–/– mice grew normally until 4–8 weeks after birth, when they began to develop lesions in the skin of the periocular region, face, and neck. MAIL mRNA and protein were constitutively expressed in the skin of wild type controls, especially in the keratinocytes. Serum IgE was higher in Mail–/– mice than in normal. Histopathological analysis indicated that the Mail–/– skin lesions appeared to be atopic dermatitis (AD) eczema with inflammatory cell infiltration. In addition, markedly elevated expression of some chemokines such as thymus and activation-regulated chemokine was detected in the Mail–/– skin lesions, similar to that observed in the skin of patients with AD. In Mail–/– mice, MAIL-deficient keratinocytes might be activated to produce chemokines and induce intraepidermal filtration of inflammatory cells, resulting in the onset of the AD-like disease. These findings suggest that MAIL is an essential molecule for homeostatic regulation of skin immunity. The Mail–/– mouse is a valuable new animal model for research on AD.

Of the major clinical features of AD, pruritus and chronic or relapsing eczematous lesions with typical shape and distribution are essential for the diagnosis. AD afflicts 10–20% of children worldwide and its pathogenesis is still poorly understood. As is true for other allergic diseases, AD has a strong genetic component, but few candidate genes have been identified. Recent results indicate that immunological mechanisms play a key role in the development of AD (1Leung D.Y. Boguniewicz M. Howell M.D. Nomura I. Hamid Q.A. J. Clin.

Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). Multiple stimuli, such as cytokines, microbiological components, stress, chemical reagents, and ultraviolet radiation, can lead to the activation of NF-κB; these stimuli induce the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) proteins in the cytoplasm via intracellular signaling pathways, thereby releasing NF-κB proteins for translocation to the nucleus to function as transcription factors. Several studies have demonstrated that NF-κB or components of the system such as IκB kinase appear to be involved in epidermal development and homeostasis (6Schmidt-Ullrich R. Aebischer T. Hulsken J. Birchmeier W. Klemm U. Scheidereit C. Development. 2001; 128: 3843-3853PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bell S. Degitz K. Quirling M. Jilg N. Page S. Brand K. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dysregulation of NF-κB has been suggested to play important roles in the development of various skin pathologies, including proliferative disorders, and immune diseases (7Bell S. Degitz K. Quirling M. Jilg N. Page S. Brand K. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 8Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D.

We identified a nuclear IκB protein, which we named MAIL for molecule possessing ankyrin repeats induced by lipopolysaccharide, also termed interleukin (IL)-1-inducible nuclear ankyrin repeat protein or IκBζ, in mice (12Kitamura H. Kanehira K. Okita K. Morimatsu M. Saito M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol.

Cytol. 2003; 66: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The expression level of MAIL mRNA is below the limits of detection constitutively but increases dramatically and rapidly after stimulation by lipopolysaccharide or proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (16Kitamura H. Matsushita Y. Iwanaga T. Mori K. Kanehira K. Fujikura D. Morimatsu M. Saito M. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2003; 66: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The MAIL protein enhances or suppresses transcription of NF-κB target genes in a gene- or cell type-specific manner. For example, ectopically expressed MAIL enhanced production of IL-6 in fibroblasts but inhibited NF-κB in macrophages (12Kitamura H. Kanehira K. Okita K. Morimatsu M. Saito M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 2004; 342: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the precise roles of MAIL, especially in vivo, remain to be elucidated. Here, we inactivated MAIL in mice by targeted gene disruption to investigate the roles of MAIL in immune and inflammatory responses. MAIL-deficient mice developed an AD-like disease accompanied by typical cellular infiltrates and chemokine expression patterns in the skin similar to those of patients with AD, providing a possible new mouse model for the study of this common allergic disease. Generation of Mail–/–Mice—The targeting vector was designed to replace the five exons (4Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar, 5Ghosh S. Karin M.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) that encode ankyrin repeats I and II with a PGK-neo cassette and to insert a nonsense mutation just downstream of the start codon of the MAIL protein (Fig. 1A). Correctly targeted AB2.2 ES-cell (129 strain) clones were identified by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1B) of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA using a probe that detected a 10- or 6-kb band for the wild type or mutant locus, respectively. Single integration was confirmed using a probe corresponding to the sequence of the neomycin-resistant gene. Two ES cell clones were injected into C57BL/6 murine blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Both clones were germ line-transmitted in the chimeric mice. The genotypes were confirmed by PCR analysis (Fig. 1C) using the following primers: primer a, 5′-TTTCTTTCGCCTCTTCACCAGGTTTCTCC-3′; primer b, 5′-TACCGCCACCTGAAAGGCAC-3′; and primer c, 5′-CTTCCATTTGTCACGTCCTGC-3′. These primers generate a 520-bp fragment for the wild type allele and a 430-bp fragment for the mutant allele. Mail–/– mice were always compared with wild type and heterozygous littermates. All animal experiments were approved by the ethical committees at Iwate University and Hokkaido University. Histology, Enzyme Histochemistry, and Immunohistochemistry— Skin biopsy samples from Mail–/– and Mail+/+ mice were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin or Bouin's solution. The fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 4-μm sections were cut. Representative paraffin sections of each skin sample were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or with toluidine blue for detection of mast cells. For detection of macrophages, formalin-fixed 6-μm cryosections were subjected to acid-phosphatase histochemistry according to the method of Burnstone (18Burstone M.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1958; 21: 523-539PubMed Google Scholar). For CD4, CD8α, B220, and MHC class II immunohistochemistry, fresh cryosections were fixed in ethanol and stained with antibodies against these antigens using the streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique, as described previously (19Konno A. Takada K. Saegusa J. Takiguchi M. Autoimmunity. 2003; 36: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MAIL immunohistochemistry was performed using Bouin's solution fixed paraffin-embedded skin sections. Briefly, deparaffinized sections were incubated in 0.4% pepsin in 0.2 n HCl at 37 °C for 30 min and then washed in tap water. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum at room temperature for 45 min. The sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against MAIL (IL-1-inducible nuclear ankyrin repeat protein) diluted to 0.1 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Wako, Osaka, Japan) at room temperature for 2 h. After rinsing with PBS, the sections were incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody (Caltag, Burlingame, CA) at 8 μg/ml for 1 h. Thereafter, to inactivate endogenous peroxidase activity, the sections were steeped in 0.3% H2O2 in methanol at room temperature for 1 h. After further rinsing with PBS, the sections were incubated with streptoavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Nichirey, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min. After rinsing again with PBS, the sections were developed with diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. For negative controls of immunostaining, nonimmune rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 0.1 μg/ml was substituted for the primary antibody. Serum IgE Measurement—Serum samples were prepared from Mail–/– and control heterozygous and wild type littermates. The concentration of IgE was quantitatively determined against a standard curve (clone 27-74; BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) in a fluorometric sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay employing monoclonal rat anti-mouse IgG as the capture antibody (clone R35-72; BD PharMingen), biotin-conjugated anti-IgE as the detection antibody (clone R35–118, BD PharMingen), and streptavidin-conjugated β-d-galactosidase for detection (Invitrogen). Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from tissue samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The cDNA was synthesized from RNA templates (3 μg) using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Conventional RT-PCR was performed for detection of MAIL, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), eotaxin, and CCR3 mRNAs. The PCR amplifications were performed using 34 cycles with the following primers: MAIL, 5′-CGCGGATCCAGTTGAGCCCCACATGG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCGTTTAGTGAAACTGGGTTGC-3′; TARC, 5′-CAGGAAGTTGGTGAGCTGGTATA-3′ and 5′-TTGTGTTCGCCTGTAGTGCATA-3′; eotaxin, 5′-CAACAGATGCACCCTGAAAGC-3′ and 5′-TCCCTGAGAGCACGTCTTAGGA-3′; CCR3, 5′-CAACTTGGCAATTTCTGACCTG-3′ and 5′-GCAAACACAGCATGGACGATAG-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-GTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. Under the conditions employed, the PCR products were obtained within the linear phase of amplification for all primer sets. Preparation of Primary Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast Cells—Primary mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were prepared from embryos at 11.5 days postcoitum as previously described (20Rudolph D. Yeh W.C. Wakeham A. Rudolph B. Nallainathan D. Potter J. Elia A.J. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 854-862PubMed Google Scholar). The head was removed, and the remainder of the embryo was cut into small pieces and trypsinized. The cells were rinsed in medium and plated onto one 60-mm plate/embryo. The embryonic fibroblasts were expanded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Separation of Keratinocytes (KCs) and Langerhans Cells (LCs)— Epidermal cells were prepared from mouse skin using a previously described technique (21Koyama Y. Kobayashi M. Ohashi K. Nagao S. Niwa J. Takahashi H. Hoshino T. Marunouchi T. J. Dermatol. 1990; 17: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). KCs and LCs were separated using immunomagnetic beads. The epidermal cells were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-I-Ad (an MHC class II antigen), washed, exposed to anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody-coated magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Berg. Gladbach, Germany), and separated into two fractions by washing under a magnetic field. The unbound cells (depleted of I-A+ cells) were designated as the KC-rich fraction, whereas the bound (enriched for I-A+ cells) cell fraction was designated as the LC-rich fraction. Gross Observations of Mail–/–Mice—MAIL mutant mice were generated using gene-targeting techniques (Fig. 1). The ratio of wild type (+/+): heterozygous (+/–): homozygous (–/–) mutant mice born from heterozygous intercrosses was 106: 179:8 (1:1.7:0.1), indicating that ∼90% of Mail–/– embryos died in utero. The Mail–/– mice that survived to birth grew normally and were of normal appearance until 4–8 weeks after birth; to the extent examined, no evident morphological or behavioral abnormalities were observed. After 4–8 weeks, the Mail–/– mice began to show a slight thickening and scaling of the periocular skin and a marked swelling of the eyelid (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, the Mail–/– mice developed alopecia of the periocular skin (Fig. 2B), which extended progressively to the skin of the face, neck, and parts of the ventral trunk (Fig. 2C). Thickening of the skin also became more severe. The eruptions were highly pruritic, based on our observations of the behavior of the mice, which used their forelegs to scratch their faces. In contrast, the heterozygote and wild type mice appeared normal (Fig. 2D). Because it was suspected from the gross observations that Mail–/– mice were affected with allergic dermatitis, we measured serum IgE levels. As shown in Fig. 2E, the serum IgE concentration in the Mail–/– mice was 2.4-fold higher than that of the control mice. Thus, the Mail–/– mice appeared to be affected with allergic dermatitis. Histopathology of the Skin of Mail–/–Mice—Skin samples from wild type mice (Fig. 3, A, D, and J) and from young (Fig. 3, B, E, and K) and aged (Fig. 3, C, F, G, H, I, and L) Mail–/–/– mice were examined histologically. The two young Mail– mice (40 and 70 days old) examined had acute eczema that was characterized by mononuclear epidermal and dermal infiltrations, acanthosis, and slight hyperkeratosis in the facial skin (Fig. 3, B and E). The inflammatory infiltrates were restricted to the epidermis and superficial dermis. A small number of neutrophils were seen in the dermis, in addition to the mononuclear cell infiltration. Eosinophils were rarely observed. The number of mast cells in the skin of the Mail–/– mice was not significantly different from that of the normal mice (Fig. 3, J and K). No ulceration was seen on the skin surface. The three aged Mail–/– mice examined (162, 174, and 189 days old) had AD-like severe chronic eczema in the facial skin (Fig. 3, C and F). The affected tissues showed mononuclear epidermal infiltration similar to that seen in the young Mail–/– mice; however, acanthosis, parakeratosis, and hyperkeratosis were more prominent in the aged mice. In addition to the mononuclear cells, the infiltrate in the older animals included lymphoid cells, melanophages, an increased number of neutrophils, and numerous mast cells (Fig. 3L) and eosinophils. Because of the excessive cell infiltration throughout the skin, the skin adnexa and cutaneous muscle layer were destroyed. Although partial spongiosis associated with the mononuclear epidermal infiltration was observed, vesiculation was not noted. The affected skin of the older mice had partial ulceration and scabbing on the skin surface. Immunohistochemistry for MHC class II, B220, CD4, and CD8, and histochemistry for acid phosphatase of the skin of the aged Mail–/– mice revealed that the mononuclear epidermal infiltrate consisted of MHC class II-positive cells with a dendritic shape that were probably LCs and CD4- and CD8-positive T cells (Fig. 3, G–I). B220-positive B cells and acid phosphatase-positive macrophages, as well as CD4 and CD8 cells, were found in the inflamed dermis and subcutaneous tissue, but not in the epidermis, in contrast to the LCs and T cells. Expression of Genes of AD-associated Chemokines in the Skin of Mail–/–Mice—Several chemokines, such as TARC and eotaxin, are expressed at high levels in skin affected by AD and lead to infiltration of inflammatory cells (2Blauvelt A. Hwang S.T. Udey M.C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: S560-S570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Vestergaard C. Yoneyama H. Murai M. Nakamura K. Tamaki K.

Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2003; 132: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine whether these chemokine genes were expressed in the skin of 6-week-old Mail–/– mice, we performed RT-PCR (Fig. 4A). Expression of the TARC gene was not detectable in the skin of wild type and heterozygote mice but was strongly expressed in the skin of Mail–/– mice. In contrast, the levels of expression of the genes for eotaxin and its receptor CCR3 in the skin of young Mail–/– mice did not differ from those in wild type mice (data not shown). As Mail–/– mice aged and the skin lesions became more severe, eotaxin and CCR3 gene expression also increased (Fig. 4B); however, this might have been attributable to a response to persistent scratching. Expression of MAIL mRNA and Protein in the Facial Skin of Normal Mice—As the lack of MAIL expression gave rise to AD-like lesions, we ascertained whether MAIL was expressed in the skin of normal wild type mice. RT-PCR showed that MAIL mRNA was strongly expressed in the facial skin and less intensely, yet substantially, in the skin of the trunk of normal mice (Fig. 5A). Proliferation of KCs and infiltration of LCs was observed on histopathological examination (above) and might represent primary pathological changes in the Mail–/– skin lesions. Consequently, we performed RT-PCR on KC- and LC-rich fractions of normal skin cells and found that MAIL mRNA was expressed predominantly in the isolated KCs as compared with the LC-rich fraction (Fig. 5B). To confirm the localization of MAIL protein in the skin, we performed immunocytochemistry using a specific antibody against MAIL. Positive immunoreaction for MAIL was observed in the KCs located in and around the neck of the hair follicles in the skin of normal mice (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the LC scattered in the basal or suprabasal layer of the normal wild type epidermis were negative for MAIL. In the dermis, MAIL immunoreactivity was negligible in all types of cell. No nonspecific immunoreaction was observed in the KCs in tissue sections stained with nonimmune rabbit IgG. In the MAIL-deficient mice, the KCs in the skin of the face did not show any immunoreactivity with the MAIL-specific antibody. These results indicate that MAIL mRNA and protein are most abundantly expressed in the epidermal KCs of normal mouse skin. In this study, we generated MAIL-deficient mice and investigated their phenotype, with particular attention to the skin. The main findings were: 1) MAIL is constitutively expressed in KCs in normal wild type skin; 2) the lack of MAIL expression in the skin led to severe dermatitis, which appeared to be AD on histopathological examination; and 3) skin cells of Mail–/–mice express markedly elevated levels of chemokines associated with AD. Yamamoto et al. (25Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) recently reported the generation of IκBζ-deficient mice independently of our group. The authors reported that the mice developed AD-like skin lesions; however, the description of the pathophysiological analysis was very limited. In the current study, we characterized the AD-like lesions in Mail–/– mice pathologically and biochemically and investigated the relationship between the expression of MAIL and the development of skin lesions in detail. The characteristics of Mail–/– mice, including the skin abnormalities, scratching of the face (indicating pruritus), and the elevated serum IgE concentration, indicated that these mice might be affected with allergic dermatitis. In the facial skin of normal wild type mice, where the dermatitis was most severe in the MAIL-deficient mice, MAIL mRNA and protein were strongly expressed in KCs. It is well documented that KCs play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of skin diseases such as AD (2Blauvelt A. Hwang S.T. Udey M.C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: S560-S570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For instance, KCs proliferate and release chemokines in AD, attracting various leukocytes into the skin (26Giustizieri M.L. Mascia F. Frezzolini A. De Pita O. Chinni L.M. Giannetti A. Girolomoni G. Pastore S. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 107: 871-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, the current results raise the possibility that the dermatitis in Mail–/– mice might be attributable to the deficiency of MAIL in the KCs of the skin. It should be mentioned that MAIL was originally identified as an inducible molecule in immunocompetent organs and cells (12Kitamura H. Kanehira K. Okita K. Morimatsu M. Saito M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 2004; 342: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); this is the first report demonstrating that MAIL is constitutively expressed in some types of cell in the skin and that it participates in the homeostatic regulation of skin immunity. The skin lesions were initially observed around the eyes. The histological analysis demonstrated both blepharitis and conjunctivitis in the Mail–/– mice. In the IκBζ-deficient mice generated by Yamamoto et al. (25Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), pathological changes observed in the conjunctiva were similar to those seen in our Mail–/– mice. Because MAIL-immunoreactive KCs were detected in the palpebral skin, but not the conjunctiva, of normal wild type mice, the conjunctivitis in the Mail–/– mice might be elicited by an inflammatory expansion of the primary blepharitis lesions. The eczema in the Mail–/– mice was characterized by intraepidermal and dermal infiltrations of inflammatory cells, acanthosis, and hyperkeratosis. Although eczema and cellular infiltrations were restricted in the early phase (1–2 months after birth), an extremely large number of inflammatory cells, including lymphoid cells, macrophages, granulocytes, and mast cells, infiltrated into the whole skin during the late phase (more than 5 months after birth). These pathological findings are consistent with those for human AD (1Leung D.Y. Boguniewicz M. Howell M.D. Nomura I. Hamid Q.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 2Blauvelt A. Hwang S.T. Udey M.C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: S560-S570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To diagnose allergic dermatitis, discrimination between AD and allergic contact dermatitis is required. Because the eczema in Mail–/– mice occurred in a region protected by hair and expanded nonfocally and bilaterally, it seems unlikely that specific contact agents were involved in their generation. Taken together, the present results suggest that the skin lesions observed in Mail–/– mice appear to be AD-like eczema rather than allergic contact dermatitis. In the pathophysiological development of human AD, several chemokines and cytokines that are secreted by the skin KCs and endothelial cells facilitate the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the skin lesions (2Blauvelt A.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 1946-1953PubMed Google Scholar). For example, TARC and eotaxin attract Th2 lymphocytes and eosinophils, respectively, into lesions (2Blauvelt A. Hwang S.T. Udey M.C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: S560-S570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Vestergaard C. Yoneyama H. Murai M. Nakamura K. Tamaki K. Terashima Y. Imai T. Yoshie O. Irimura T. Mizutani H. Matsushima K. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that TARC was markedly expressed in the skin tissues of Mail–/– mice as compared with those of wild type mice. In addition, expression of the genes for eotaxin and its receptor CCR3 were also higher in the severe skin lesions than in normal wild type skin. The up-regulation of chemokines supports the hypothesis that the skin lesions of Mail–/– mice are AD-like eczema. Furthermore, the expression levels of two chemokines that are associated with inflammatory diseases, interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 and RANTES (24Heishi M. Imai Y. Katayama H. Hashida R. Ito M. Shinagawa A. Sugita Y. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2003; 132: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Noso N. Sticherling M. Bartels J. Mallet A.I. Christophers E. Schroder J.M. J.

Thus, MAIL plays suppressive roles in the production of chemokines both in the presence and in the absence of inflammatory stimulants. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying the promotion of chemokine production remain unclear. In light of a report by Yamazaki et al. (13Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), it is possible that MAIL deficiency leads to accelerated chemokine production through overactivation (or desuppression) of NF-κB. Other murine models for AD have been reported previously. For example, mice deficient in RelB, a member of the NF-κB family, were clinically normal until 4–10 weeks after birth, at which point thickening of the skin and hair loss developed (10Barton D. HogenEsch H. Weih F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, the mRNA levels of chemokines such as eotaxin and CCR3 were elevated in the skin of RelB–/– mice, and the serum IgE concentration was increased (10Barton D. HogenEsch H. Weih F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Weih F. Warr G. Yang H. Bravo R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5211-5218PubMed Google Scholar). Because no direct association between MAIL and RelB has been reported, the mechanism for the development of the skin lesions in the Mail–/– mice might differ from that in the RelB–/– mice. In another AD model, NC/Nga mice developed an eczematous condition with increased serum IgE from 8 weeks of age (31Matsuda H. Watanabe N. Geba G.P. Sperl J. Tsudzuki M. Hiroi J. Matsumoto M. Ushio H. Saito S. Askenase P.W. Ra C. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). TARC, eotaxin, and CCR3 were expressed in the skin of NC/Nga mice (22Vestergaard C. Yoneyama H. Murai M. Nakamura K. Tamaki K. Terashima Y. Imai T. Yoshie O. Irimura T. Mizutani H. Matsushima K. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, there are important differences between the existing murine models of AD and Mail–/– mice. In NC/Nga mice, the dominant lesions are observed in the dorsal skin (22Vestergaard C. Yoneyama H. Murai M. Nakamura K. Tamaki K. Terashima Y. Imai T. Yoshie O. Irimura T. Mizutani H. Matsushima K. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 31Matsuda H.

Immunol. 1997; 9: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), and the gene(s) responsible has not been identified. Although Mail–/– mice developed AD-like eczema when kept under specific pathogen-free conditions, the NC/Nga mice have been reported to develop an eczematous condition when kept in conventional housing but not when kept under specific pathogen-free conditions. The current data support the contention that Mail–/– mice might provide a useful model for the study of the pathogenesis of AD from a new viewpoint. Genome-wide linkage studies have been performed to identify susceptibility loci for AD (1Leung D.Y. Boguniewicz M. Howell M.D. Nomura I. Hamid Q.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Lee et al. (32Lee Y.A. Wahn U. Kehrt R. Tarani L. Businco L. Gustafsson D. Andersson F. Oranje A.P. Wolkertstorfer A. v Berg A. Hoffmann U. Kuster W. Wienker T. Ruschendorf F. Reis A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) demonstrated that AD in humans is linked to chromosome 3q21. Interestingly, this locus is near the region that encodes the Mail gene (15Shiina T. Morimatsu M. Kitamura H. Ito T. Kidou S. Matsubara K. Matsuda Y. Saito M. Syuto B. Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, Mail might represent a susceptibility gene for AD. These results suggest that the eczema of Mail–/– mice might be an AD-like disease, which is probably elicited by MAIL deficiency and the subsequent up-regulation of chemokines such as TARC and eotaxin in skin KCs. We hypothesize that the pathophysiology of the AD in Mail–/– mice proceeds as follows. KCs activated (or desuppressed) by the MAIL deficiency proliferate and produce chemokines such as TARC and eotaxin, resulting in intraepidermal infiltration of LCs and CD4+ T cells. These infiltrating cells elicit primary inflammatory responses that are restricted to the epidermis and superficial dermis during the early phase. Cytokines derived from CD4+ T cells sensitized by LCs then bring about the secondary infiltration and proliferation of B cells and mast cells into the dermis. The mast cells secrete several chemical mediators, such as histamine and serotonin, causing facial pruritus that elicits persistent scratching in the affected mice. This scratching results in progressive tissue destruction and consequently exacerbates the pathology. Further comprehensive studies, including proteomic and transcriptomic studies, will provide information about the molecular events underlying the development of eczematous dermatitis in Mail–/– mice. In conclusion, we generated Mail–/– mice by targeted disruption of the Mail gene. These mice were affected with an AD-like skin disease. We believe that these mice are a suitable model for research on severe dermatitis such as AD."
https://openalex.org/W2073968140,"Oncogenic Ras is known to drive both the Rac and Raf-MAP-kinase pathways, which act in concert to cause cell transformation. Unlike the Raf-MAP-kinase cascade, however, the downstream elements of Rac pathway are not fully understood. Previously, we showed that cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and subsequent metabolism of arachidonic acid act downstream of Rac to mediate the transformation signaling induced by Ha-RasV12. In the present study, we observed that leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and its synthetic enzymes as well as BLT2, the low-affinity LTB4 receptor, are all elevated in Ha-RasV12-transformed cells. In addition, the malignant phenotypes of Ras-transformed cells were markedly inhibited by BLT2 blockade, as was their tumorigenicity in vivo. Finally, in situ hybridization analysis revealed that expression of BLT2 is significantly upregulated in a variety of human cancers. Taken together, our results suggest that an LTB4-BLT2-linked cascade plays a crucial mediatory role in the cell transformation induced by oncogenic Ha-RasV12, possibly acting downstream of Rac-cPLA2."

Newly synthesized proteins fold to unique three-dimensional structures and become functionally active. It has been well established that the newly synthesized proteins require a complex cellular machinery of molecular chaperones to reach their native conformations. Molecular chaperones identify the nonnative proteins, prevent them from misfolding and aggregation, bind with them, and assist in correct folding inside cells (1Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M.

The major conserved families of these heat shock proteins (Hsps) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, human heat shock protein; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; ANS, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; Prodan, 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)naphthalene. have been shown to be involved in assisting protein folding (7Morimoto R.I.

Chem. 1998; 379: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular chaperone proteins have some common structural features. They have a domain containing a bundle of hydrophobic residues suitably located at the surface of the protein enabling it to bind lipophilic substances such as hydrophobic fluorescent probes, ANS or bis-ANS, evidenced in α-crystallin (9Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 10Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, many chaperones have distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains and exist as miceller oligomeric aggregates like those in GroEL, TriC, and α-casein (11Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R.

There are also some other properties that are typically found in molecular chaperones: (a) inhibition of protein aggregation, (b) protection of enzymes against activity loss caused by denaturation, and (c) promotion of the renaturation of denatured proteins. Numerous reports in recent literature have shown that several new chaperones have one or more of these activities in them. Among the chaperone proteins not belonging to the Hsp family, α-crystallin was first shown to have chaperone-like function in suppressing aggregation of various proteins by heat or by using other agents that induce aggregation (16Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). Similarly for tubulin, a ubiquitous cytoskeletal protein and the building block unit of the microtubule assembly, it was observed that the protein could also suppress both thermal and nonthermal aggregation of a number of unrelated proteins, and the negatively charged C-terminal tail plays a crucial role for its chaperone like activity (17Guha S.

Spectrin is the major constituent protein of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton that forms a filamentous network on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. It is an elongated αβ-heterodimer with large molecular mass of ∼520,000 Daltons (19Bennett V. Branton D. J. Biol.

Spectrin isoforms have been identified in a wide variety of nonerythroid cells. Nonerythroid spectrin also localizes predominantly along cellular plasma membranes (21Hartwig J.H. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 703-800PubMed Google Scholar). Spectrin binds to a wide range of ligands like hemein and protoporphyrin (24Beavan G.H. Gratzer W.B.

Rev. 1990; 70: 1029-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Association of spectrin with other proteins are essential to establish the planar network along with additional interactions of fatty acids (38Kahana E. Pinder J.C. Smith K.S. Gratzer W.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and phospholipids (39Cohen A.M. Liu S.C. Derick L.H. Palek J. Blood. 1986; 68: 920-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Diakowski W. Sikorski A.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13252-13258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Ray S. Chakrabarti A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The major function of spectrin is presumed to be to establish the cytoskeletal network that provides mechanical strength to cell membrane. However, its capability to interact with such wide ranges of different proteins and small hydrophobic ligands along with its wide abundance also in nonerythroid tissues suggests that spectrin participates in other cellular functions as well. Spectrin shares some common interactive features with the proteins exhibiting chaperone activity. It has the hydrophobic binding sites for lipophilic molecules through which it can interact with the denatured proteins. Spectrin interacts with other proteins to establish the cytoskeleton and self-associate to form tetramers and higher order aggregates. Spectrin is presumably heat-stable to ensure its isolation at 37 °C. In an earlier study, we have shown that binding of denatured horseradish peroxidase with spectrin takes place during refolding of the denatured heme enzyme leading to inhibition of enzyme activity (42Chakrabarti A. Bhattacharya S. Ray S. Bhattacharyya M. Biochem. Biopphys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1189-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Since then we have tried to investigate in detail the chaperone properties of spectrin in its dimeric, tetrameric forms along with both the α- and β-subunits using conventional chaperone assay systems. We have compared the chaperone properties in terms of preventing the extent of nonthermal aggregation of insulin and thermal aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) by the spectrin derivatives and have compared the activities with that of Hsp90 with which both α- and β-spectrin showed appreciable sequence homology. We have also studied the effects of spectrin derivatives on the enzyme activity of α-glucosidase and alkaline phosphatase. Spectrin could prevent both thermal and nonthermal aggregation of ADH and insulin and increased the reactivation yield of both the enzymes after refolding from a completely denatured state. We have, on the other hand, studied the binding of two well known fluorescence probes, Prodan and ANS, and have characterized a unique binding site of Prodan at the self-associating domain of spectrin with the binding stoichiometry of one Prodan bound to both the dimeric and tetrameric spectrin. However, ANS did not show such specificity for spectrin as observed with that of Prodan, and the stoichiometry of binding was between 3 and 5 ANS/dimeric and tetrameric spectrin, respectively. In our opinion, the unique Prodan-binding site at the self-associating domain of erythroid spectrin could be correlated with the origin of the chaperone activity in spectrin. The N-terminal residues of α-spectrin and C-terminal residues of β-spectrin have also been found to have more than 50% sequence homology with the well known chaperone protein, Hsp90. Insulin from bovine pancreas, recombinant Hsp90 expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ADH from equine liver, α-glucosidase from Baker's yeast, p-nitrophenylphosphate, p-nitrophenyl α-d-glucopyranoside, BSA, Tris, DTT, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and EDTA were purchased from Sigma. Prodan and ANS were obtained from Molecular Probes. Alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli C600 was purified following published protocol (43Torriani A. Methods Enzymol. 1968; 12: 212-218Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were obtained locally. Deionized water was doubly distilled on quartz before using them for the preparation of buffers and all other solutions. Isolation and Purification of Spectrin Dimer, Tetramer, and Its Subunits—Clean, white ghosts from ovine blood were prepared by hypotonic lysis in 5 mm phosphate, 1 mm EDTA containing 20 μg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at pH 8.0 (lysis buffer) following the procedure of Dodge et al. (44Dodge J.T. Mitchell C. Hanahan D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 100: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3636) Google Scholar). Spectrin dimers were purified by following published protocol that is elaborated in our earlier work (45Ray S. Chakrabarti A. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 54: 16-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After washing the membranes thoroughly in lysis buffer, the band 6 depleted ghosts were resuspended in 20 volumes of spectrin removal buffer (0.2 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min for purification of the dimeric spectrin. The ghost membranes, resuspended in 20 volumes of spectrin removal buffer, were dialyzed overnight against the same buffer at 4 °C for purification of the spectrin tetramer (46Gratzer W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 85: 475-480Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The crude spectrin was collected in the supernatant after centrifugation. Both dimeric and tetrameric spectrin were then purified after concentration by 30% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B. Spectrin was stored in the buffer containing 5 mm phosphate, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 containing 0.2 mm DTT. To isolate the subunits, spectrin was first dialyzed overnight against the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 and then adjusted to 3 m urea and 0.15 m NaCl by the addition of urea and NaCl from a concentrated stock in the same buffer. This solution was incubated for 1 h and then applied on a DEAE-cellulose column, pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The β-spectrin came out in the flow-through, and the α-spectrin was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl as described earlier (47Yoshino H. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4496-4500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subunits obtained were renatured by dialyzing first against 5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol at pH 7.4, followed by dialysis against the same buffer without the β-mercaptoethanol (48Subbarao N.K. MacDonald C.R. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 29: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Before all of the fluorescence experiments, the protein was dialyzed extensively against the buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, to remove DTT. The purity of the preparation was checked by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions showing the characteristic band of spectrin dimer (α chain of ∼280 kDa and β chain of 248 kDa) after Coomassie Blue staining. Dimeric spectrin concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an absorbance of 10.7 at 280 nm for 1% spectrin solution, and the dimeric, tetrameric, α-spectrin, and β-spectrin concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (49Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of Prodan and ANS to Spectrin by Fluorescence Measurements—Steady state fluorescence experiments were performed using a Hitachi F-4010 spectrofluorometer using 10-mm-path length quartz cuvettes. Prodan binding experiments were done using 0.2–0.5 μm Prodan, to which increasing amounts of spectrin were added, and fluorescence emission intensity was measured by using excitation at 360 nm with 5-nm band pass slits for both excitation and emission channels. The emission intensity was monitored at 430 nm (I430) and 520 nm (I520) for spectrin-bound and free Prodan, respectively (27Chakrabarti A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The concentrations of Prodan and ANS in dimethylformamide were determined using molar absorbance of 18,000 at 360 nm and 7800 at 372 nm, respectively (50Haughland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. Spence, M. T. Z. Molecular Probes, OR1996: 320Google Scholar). The buffer used in the present study contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl at pH 7.8. The sample temperature was maintained at 25 °C for all experiments unless otherwise mentioned. The ANS binding experiments were done by reverse titration using 4 μm spectrin, to which increasing amounts of ANS were added and fluorescence emission intensity was measured by using excitation at 372 nm with band pass of 5-nm slits for both excitation and emission channels. The emission intensity was monitored at 470 nm for spectrin-bound ANS. The results of fluorometric titrations were analyzed by three different methods. First, a model independent method was used, and the apparent dissociation constants of Prodan and ANS binding to spectrin (Kd) were determined by nonlinear curve fitting analysis using Equation 2. All of the experimental points for binding isotherm were fitted by least square analysis using Microcal Origin software package (version 5.0) from Microcal Software Inc. (Northampton, MA). The binding stoichiometries of the Prodan/ANS-spectrin complex were estimated from the intercept of two straight lines of the nonlinear fitted plot of ΔF/ΔFmax against the input concentrations of spectrin/ANS.Kd=[C0−(ΔF/ΔFmax)⋅C0]⋅[Cp−(ΔF/ΔFmax)⋅C0]/(ΔF/ΔFmax)⋅C0(Eq. 1) C0⋅(ΔF/ΔFmax)2−(C0+Cp+Kd)⋅(ΔF/ΔFmax)+Cp=0(Eq. 2) In Equations 1 and 2, ΔF is the change in fluorescence emission intensity at 470 nm (λex = 372 nm) or the ratio I520/I430 (λex = 360 nm) for each point on the titration curve, ΔFmax denotes the same when spectrin is completely bound to Prodan, Cp is the concentration of the spectrin, and C0 is the initial concentration of Prodan. The double reciprocal plot was used for determination of ΔFmax and also the apparent binding constant (Kapp) using Equation 3.1/ΔF=1/ΔFmax+1/[Kapp⋅ΔFmax(Cp−C0)](Eq. 3) The linear double reciprocal plot of 1/Δ – F against 1/(Cp – C0) is extrapolated to the ordinate to obtain the value of ΔFmax from the intercept (51Wang J.L. Edelman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1185-1192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Kapp is the inverse of the binding dissociation constant (Kd). The approach is based on the assumption that change of emission intensity ratio of Prodan is proportional to the concentration of the spectrin. Similarly for ANS binding to spectrin this assumption is also valid because the quantum yield of ANS is appreciably low in aqueous buffer and only increases with increasing concentrations of ANS after binding to a reasonably higher concentration of spectrin (4 μm). In case of ANS, the reverse titration is done, and accordingly the Cp becomes the concentration of ANS, and C0 becomes the concentration of spectrin. The Scatchard equation (52Scatchard G. Coleman J.S. Shen A.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 12-20Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar) was also used to estimate the intrinsic binding constants (K0) and the binding stoichiometry (n).r/Cf=K0(n−r)(Eq. 4) In this equation, r = Cb/Cp, when Cb is the concentration of the spectrin-bound Prodan, and Cp is the input concentration of spectrin. The concentration of the bound Prodan (Cb) was determined by normalizing the input concentration of Prodan with ΔF/ΔFmax. The Scatchard plot was obtained by plotting r/Cf against r where Cf is (C0 – Cb), and the best fit straight line through the experimental data points led to the determination of binding constant, K0, and the stoichiometry, n. Similarly, the ANS binding data were also analyzed to obtain the binding constant and the stoichiometry. The method of continuous variation was also applied to obtain reliable estimates of the binding stoichiometry of spectrin with Prodan and ANS (53Hill Z.D. MacCarthy P. J. Chem. Edu. 1986; 63: 162-167Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). At constant temperature, 25 °C, the fluorescence intensities of Prodan-bound and ANS-bound spectrin were recorded for solutions where the concentration of both spectrin and Prodan/ANS were varied, whereas the sum of their concentration was kept constant at 1.5 μm for Prodan and 4 μm for ANS. This concentration was chosen from the binding isotherm, indicating appreciable binding (∼50%) between spectrin and the ligands. The difference in the fluorescence of the ligands in absence and presence of the spectrin (ΔF) was plotted as a function of the input mole fraction of spectrin. The break point in the resulting plot corresponds to the mole fraction of the ligand in the spectrin-ligand complexes. Therefore, stoichiometry is obtained in terms of spectrin-ligand (χp:1 – χp), where χp denotes the ratio of molar concentration of the protein to the total molar concentrations of spectrin and the ligands. Both Prodan and ANS binding experiments were done with dimeric and tetrameric spectrin. The binding experiments with the spectrin subunits could not be done because of the problem of solubility of the α- and β-subunits at higher concentrations. To obtain binding estimates of Prodan and ANS for the individual subunits, fluorescence measurements were done with spectrin in 3 m urea, where the individual subunits stay dissociated from the intact dimeric spectrin (47Yoshino H. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4496-4500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of the steady state fluorescence polarization of both tryptophan (λex = 295 nm) and the spectrin-bound ANS and Prodan also indicated binding. Assay of Protein Aggregation—Insulin was dissolved in a minimum volume of 20 mm NaOH and then diluted to the required concentration (0.3 mg/ml) in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The reduction of insulin was initiated by adding 20 μlof1 m DTT to 1 ml in absence and presence of spectrin dimer, tetramer, the spectrin subunits, BSA and Hsp90, the latter being used as the positive control. The aggregation of the insulin B chain was measured as a function of time at 25 °C by monitoring the apparent absorbance (scattering) at 360 nm (17Guha S. Manna T.K. Das K.P. Bhattacharyya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similar experiments on the thermal aggregation of ADH (0.4 mg/ml) were done at 50 °C, in the absence and presence of spectrin dimer, tetramer, and its subunits, by measuring the 90° light scattering at 450 nm. Folding of Denatured Enzymes—Two enzymes, α-glucosidase and bacterial alkaline phosphatase, were used in this work as substrates for the chaperone. α-Glucosidase was denatured at a concentration of 400 μg/ml in 8 m urea for 1.5 h in a buffer containing 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.6. Refolding was initiated on 100-fold dilution in the absence and the presence of different concentrations of spectrin dimer, tetramer, and its subunits in the same buffer containing 0.3 mmp-nitrophenyl α-d-glucopyranoside. The extent of reactivation of denatured α-glucosidase after refolding was determined assuming the activity of the equivalent amount of the native enzyme as 100%. The enzyme activity of α-glucosidase was assayed by monitoring the continuous increase of absorbance at 400 nm with time (54Guagliardi A. Cerchia L. Rossi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28126-28132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase was denatured in 6 m guanidine HCl at 25 °C for 1 h. The inactivated enzyme was diluted 50-fold in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 in presence and absence of spectrin dimer, tetramer, and both the subunits for 20 min to initiate refolding of the denatured enzyme. The mixture was then further diluted 50 times in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 μmp-nitrophenylphosphate and left for 20 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of K2HPO4 to a final concentration of 100 mm, and the absorbance was measured at 400 nm (43Torriani A. Methods Enzymol. 1968; 12: 212-218Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Homology Search with Chaperones—Ovine erythroid spectrin, used in this study, has structural and self-associating properties that are indistinguishable from that of human and bovine spectrin (41Ray S. Chakrabarti A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 55Cole N. Ralston G.B. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Because the sequence of ovine erythroid spectrin is not known, we have used sequences of the human α- and β-spectrin. The pairwise alignment of the sequences with some other well known chaperones is done by the Needleman and Wunsch (56Needleman S.B. Wunsch C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (7853) Google Scholar) method of global alignment as implemented in the EMBOSS suite of software using the scoring matrix Eblosum62 (57Rice P. Longden I. Bleasby A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 276-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6527) Google Scholar). To characterize the chaperone activity, we have used insulin and alcohol dehydrogenase as the model substrates to check whether spectrin could prevent the aggregation of the two proteins. The B-chain of insulin aggregates upon reduction of the disulfide bond over a wide temperature range. Insulin aggregation was studied with time in the presence and absence of different concentrations of the spectrin dimer at 25 °C. Spectrin in all of the four dimeric, tetrameric, and α- and β-forms prevents the aggregation of insulin at 25 °C to different extents in a concentration-dependent manner (shown in Fig. 1 for dimeric spectrin). At insulin to spectrin weight ratio of 1:0.2 aggregation is significantly prevented to ∼30% and at 1:0.5 and 1:1, the aggregation of insulin was prevented up to ∼45 and ∼70%, respectively, after 30 min. The well known chaperone protein Hsp90, used as the positive control, at 1:1 weight ratio of insulin to Hsp90 could bring about 50% prevention, whereas BSA at 1:2 weight ratio could prevent only 5% of the extent"
https://openalex.org/W1974448932,"The human cationic amino acid transporter hCAT-1 is almost ubiquitously expressed and probably the most important entity for supplying cells with extracellular arginine, lysine, and ornithine. We have previously shown that hCAT-1-mediated transport is decreased after protein kinase C (PKC) activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Gräf, P., Förstermann, U., and Closs, E. I. (2001) Br. J. Pharmacol. 132, 1193–1200). In the present study, we examined the mechanism of this down-regulation. In both Xenopus laevis oocytes and U373MG glioblastoma cells, PMA treatment promoted the internalization of hCAT-1 (fused to the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)) as visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Biotinylation of cell surface proteins and subsequent Western blot analyses confirmed that the cell surface expression of hCAT-1·EGFP was significantly reduced upon PMA treatment. Pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I prevented the reduction by PMA of both hCAT-1·EGFP-induced arginine transport and the internalization of the transporter. Similar results were obtained with hCAT-1 expressed endogenously in DLD-1 colon carcinoma cells. Inhibition of protein synthesis did not augment the PMA effect. In addition, the PMA effect was reverted in washout experiments without changing the hCAT-1 protein expression, suggesting that the PMA effect is reversible in these cells. PKC did not phosphorylate hCAT-1 directly as evidenced by in vivo phosphorylation experiments and mutational analysis, indicating an indirect action of PKC on hCAT-1.

The cationic amino acid transporter CAT-1 represents most likely the major carrier for cationic amino acids in most mammalian cells (for review see Refs. 1Closs E.I. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertension. 2002; 11: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and 2Verrey F. Closs E.I. Wagner C.A. Palacin M. Endou H. Kanai Y. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 447: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). With the exception of the adult liver, CAT-1 expression has been found in every tissue and cell line so far investigated (3Vékony N. Wolf S. Boissel J.P. Gnauert K. Closs E.I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12387-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Homozygous deletion of the CAT-1 gene in mice results in anemia and perinatal death, underlining the importance of this carrier (4Perkins C.P. Mar V. Shutter J.R. delCastillo J. Danilenko D.M.

The transport characteristics of CAT-1 are consistent with the so called system y+, a Na+- and pH-independent transport system selective for cationic amino acids (5Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 6Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. North R.A. Kabat D.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6462-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Two related transporters, CAT-2B and CAT-3, exhibit similar transport properties, yet differ in their expression pattern. CAT-2B is a cytokine-inducible transporter that is always co-expressed with CAT-1. However, CAT-1 can apparently not always replace the function of CAT-2B in supplying the substrate arginine to the inducible nitric-oxide synthase (8Manner C.K. Nicholson B. MacLeod C.L. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Nicholson B. Manner C.K. Kleeman J. MacLeod C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15881-15885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This suggests that each CAT isoform operates in a distinct compartment of the plasma membrane. Besides its general role in delivery of essential and semi-essential amino acids for protein synthesis, a specific role of CAT-1 has been proposed for providing substrate for (endothelial NO synthase-mediated) NO synthesis in endothelial cells (for review, see Ref. 1Closs E.I. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertension. 2002; 11: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), for polyamine synthesis in regenerating hepatocytes (10Aulak K.S. Liu J. Wu J. Hyatt S.L. Puppi M.

Reyna S.V. Peyton K.J. Schafer A.I. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Despite its almost ubiquitous expression, CAT-1 underlies a complex regulation. For the rat orthologue, extensive transcriptional as well as translational regulation has been demonstrated (Ref. 12Yaman I. Fernandez J. Liu H. Caprara M. Komar A.A. Koromilas A.E. Zhou L. Snider M.D. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Hatzoglou M. Cell. 2003; 113: 519-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar and references therein). In addition, several groups have reported that CAT-1 activity can be regulated at the post-translational level (for review see Ref. 1Closs E.I. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertension. 2002; 11: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).

This reduction in transport activity was not accompanied by a decrease in the total level of hCAT-1 protein (13Gräf P. Förstermann U. Closs E.I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A more recent study confirmed these findings in porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells and identified classical PKC isoforms, most likely PKCα, as responsible for this down-regulation (14Krotova K.Y. Zharikov S.I. Block E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L1037-L1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CAT-1 exhibits three consensus sequences for PKC phosphorylation that are located in the fifth and sixth putative intracellular loops according to the model by Albritton et al. (15Albritton L.M. Tseng L. Scadden D. Cunningham J.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 659-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) that suggests 14 membrane-spanning domains. These sites are conserved between human, rat, and mouse CAT-1. In the present study, we examined more closely the mechanism of the PKC-mediated down-regulation of CAT-1. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Deletion of the PKC binding sites of hCAT-1 was achieved by site-directed mutagenesis of the hCAT-1 cDNA inserted in the pSP64T vector (pSPhCAT-1AB1) (6Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. North R.A. Kabat D. Nature. 1991; 352: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the oligonucleotides listed in Table I. The entire coding region of the resulting plasmid (pSPhCAT-1S476A/S482A/S557A) was sequenced to ensure that no additional mutation had been introduced into the hCAT-1 cDNA.Table IOligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis of the hCAT-1 cDNAOligonucleotideMutationCAGAGGCAGAGATGTTCGCTTTGAAAACCATACTCMutation of Ser476 to AlaCTTTGAAAACCATACTCGCACCCAAAAACATGGAGCMutation of Ser482 to AlaGAGCAAGACCAAGCTTGCATTTAAGGTTCCCTTCMutation of Ser557 to Ala Open table in a new tab EGFP Fusion Constructs—The constructs hCAT-1·EGFP-pSP64T (for transcription of cRNA for X. laevis oocytes) and hCAT-1/pEGFP-N1 (for expression in mammalian cells) encode EGFP fused to the C terminus of hCAT-1 and have been described earlier (16Wolf S. Janzen A. Vékony N. Martiné U. Strand D. Closs E.I. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The hCAT-1S476A/S482A/S557A /pEGFP-N1 construct was generated by introducing a 840-bp PCR fragment from pSPhCAT-1S476A/S482A/S557A into the KpnI/XmaI sites of the hCAT-1·pEGFP-N1 (oligonucleotides used for PCR: CTTCTAGGATCCATGTTTCC and GATCCCGGGCCTTGCACTGGTCCAAGT, sense and antisense, respectively). Transport Studies in X. laevis Oocytes—hCAT-1·EGFP-pSP64T and pSPhCAT-1S476A/S482A/S557A were linearized with EcoRI, and cRNA was prepared by in vitro transcription from the SP6 promoter (mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit; Ambion, AMS Biotechnology Europe, Cambridgeshire, UK). 30 ng of cRNA (in 40 nl of H2O) were injected into each X. laevis oocyte (Dumont stages V–VI). Oocytes injected with 40 nl of water were used as controls. Arginine uptake was determined 3 days after injection of cRNA as previously described (7Closs E.I. Gräf P. Habermeier A. Cunningham J.M. Förstermann U. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6462-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, the oocytes were equilibrated for 2 h at 18 °C in uptake solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing 100 μm of unlabeled arginine. The oocytes were then transferred to the same solution containing 100 nm PMA in 0.1% Me2SO or 0.1% Me2SO alone (30 min, 20 °C). After the preincubation, the oocytes were washed in uptake solution containing 100 μm arginine and transferred to the same solution supplemented with 5 μCi/ml l-[3H]arginine (ICN, Eschwege, Germany; l-[4,5-3H]arginine, 39 Ci/mmol). After incubation for 15 min at 20 °C, the oocytes were washed four times in ice-cold uptake solution and solubilized individually in 2% SDS. The incorporated radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Cryostat Sections of X. laevis Oocytes—Three days after injection with hCAT-1·EGFPcRNA, the oocytes were treated with 100 nm PMA or 0.1% Me2SO alone (30 min, 20 °C) in uptake solution containing 100 μm arginine. The oocytes were then washed five times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen in tissue freezing medium (Leica Instruments, Jung). 12-μm cryostat sections were made at –15 °C, and fluorescent micrographs were taken using a Leitz DMRB fluorescence microscope (Leica, Bensheim, Germany) and a Nikon DXM1200 digital camera (Nikon Co., Tokyo, Japan). Cell Culture—The human U373 MG glioblastoma and the DLD-1 colon carcinoma cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cells were grown in Iscove's medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. U373 MG-derived clones described below were maintained in medium containing 600 μg/ml G418. The cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma infection using 4,6-diamindine 2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Roche Applied Science). No contamination was detected. Transfection of U373MG Glioblastoma Cells—The cells were seeded into 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) 1 day before transfection using the Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen). Plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) and 3.2 μl of Enhancer were added to 100 μl of transfection buffer, mixed with 10 μl of Effectene, and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Then 600 μl of medium containing 10% serum were added. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated with the transfection reagent for 6 h at 37 °C. Two days after transfection, the cells were split into 10-cm dishes. Stably transfected cell clones were selected in medium containing 600 μg/ml G418. For each construct, several independent clones were singled out. Confocal Microscopy—The cells were grown on cover glass-bottomed chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) and either directly analyzed or fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and washed with PBS. The cells were analyzed with a Zeiss 510 confocal laser scan microscope equipped with a UV laser (Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany). The images were collected with a 1.4 numerical aperture 63× Zeiss Plan-aprochromat objective using identical scanning parameters. Transport Studies in Human Cells—Cells grown to confluence in 96-well plates were preincubated for the indicated time at 37 °C in 100 μl well–1 of medium containing PMA or other compounds in the concentration given in the figure legend. The cells were then washed twice with Locke's solution (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4) containing 100 μm of arginine, before incubation in the same solution containing in addition 5–10 μCi/ml l-[3H]arginine (39 Ci/mmol) for 30 s at 37 °C. The endogenous hCAT-1 transport in DLD-1 colon carcinoma cells was measured in the presence of additional 2 mm leucine. The cells were then immediately transferred on ice, washed three times with ice-cold Locke's solution, and lysed in 0.5 m NaOH (50 μl/well, 30 min at 4 °C). After neutralization of the lysates with 50 μlof0.5 m HCl and 100 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA), the protein content of each sample was determined using the Bradford reaction (Bio-Rad). The radioactivity in the samples was measured by liquid scintillation counting. For transfected cells, the transport values of cells stably transfected with pEGFP-N1 were subtracted. The background radioactivity derived from arginine bound to the cells (determined by addition of Locke's solution containing 100 μm l-[3H]arginine (5–10 μCi/ml) followed by immediate washing steps) were subtracted from all values (usually less than 10% of experimental values). Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Biotinylation of cell surface proteins was performed as described (17Gonzalez M.I. Kazanietz M.G. Robinson M.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm dishes, rinsed with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-Ca/Mg), and incubated in the same solution supplemented with 1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin (EZ-Link™ sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinoamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate; Pierce) for 20 min at 4 °C. The cells were then rinsed three times with PBS-Ca/Mg containing 100 mm glycine and incubated in this buffer for 30 min at 4 °C to quench any unbound biotin. The cells were then lysed by the addition of 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing protease inhibitors (complete; Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. After removal of the cellular debris protein concentration of the lysates was determined using the Bradford reaction. Where indicated, lysates were treated with N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science; 2 units/100 μg protein, 30 min at 37 °C). Biotinylated proteins (about 150 μg of U373 lysates or 800 μg of DLD-1 lysates) were batch-extracted using avidin-coated Sepharose beads (immobilized NeutrAvidin™ (Pierce), 4 °C, overnight) and then released from the beads by incubation in 30 μl of sample buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 4% SDS, 8 m urea, 3.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, 30 min at room temperature). To total cell lysates, an equal volume sample buffer was added. Western Blots—Lysates and cell surface proteins were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE and then blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran83; Schleicher & Schuell). Staining for EGFP fusion proteins and hCAT-1, respectively, was achieved by sequential incubations in: Blotto (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.01% antifoam A (Sigma), 0.05% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk) containing 10% goat serum (2 h at room temperature), a dilution of the first antibody (1:500 of an anti-GFP peptide antibody (Clontech), or a 1:200 dilution of our hCAT-1 antibody (13Gräf P. Förstermann U. Closs E.I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 (overnight, 4 °C), three times Blotto (15 min, room temperature), a 1:10000 dilution in Blotto of a peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) (1 h, room temperature); three times TBST (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), once in TBS (10 mm Tris/HCl pH 8; 150 mm NaCl) and finally for 1 min with chemiluminescence reagent (Renaissance; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). X-ray film (Agfa, Leverkusen, Germany) was then immediately exposed to the membranes. The membranes were stripped (in 62.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C) and stained with a monoclonal antibody to β-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma) and a peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:3000; Sigma). In Vivo Phosphorylation and Immunoprecipitation—Cells grown to confluence in 3-cm dishes were first incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), 5% fetal bovine serum and then for 2.5 h in medium containing 750 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences). During the last 30 min, the cells were treated with 100 nm PMA or 0.1% Me2SO. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in 0.5 ml/well radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (complete; Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (25 mm NaF; 10 mm β-glycerophosphate; 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 nm okadaic acid). After removal of the cellular debris, the lysates were treated with N-glycosidase F (see above) and precleared with protein A-agarose (Affi-Gel Protein A; Bio-Rad). hCAT-1·EGFP protein was then immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal GFP anti-serum (Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany; 1:200) and protein A-agarose (incubation overnight, 4 °C). After washing five times with PBS, immobilized protein was released with 30 μl of sample buffer (see above) for 10 min at 60 °C. 25 μl of each sample was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried, and phosphorylated protein was visualized using a Personal-FX molecular imager (Bio-Rad). In parallel experiments hCAT-1·EGFP was immunoprecipitated from 300 μl of lysate obtained in the same way from unlabeled cells and detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Clontech; 1:2000). PMA-induced Internalization of hCAT-1 Expressed in X. laevis Oocytes—To visualize the cell surface expression of hCAT-1, the enhanced green fluorescent protein fused to the C terminus of hCAT-1 was expressed in X. laevis oocytes. In our earlier report, we have shown that this fusion protein has transport properties indistinguishable from wild type hCAT-1 (16Wolf S. Janzen A. Vékony N. Martiné U. Strand D. Closs E.I. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fluorescent micrographs revealed a discernible decrease of hCAT-1·EGFP expression in the plasma membrane of the oocytes upon PMA treatment (100 nm, 30 min; Fig. 1, A and B). The same PMA treatment lead to a 55 ± 7% reduction in hCAT-1·EGFP-mediated arginine transport, consistent with our previous studies using wild type hCAT-1 (13Gräf P. Förstermann U. Closs E.I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). PKC-mediated Internalization of hCAT-1 Expressed in Human Cells—hCAT-1·EGFP stably expressed in several independent U373MG glioblastoma cell clones was localized in the plasma membrane as well as in intracellular vesicles as evidenced by confocal microscopy. In the plasma membrane, a distinct fluorescence pattern could be detected with the strongest fluorescence intensity always observed in the ruffled borders (Fig. 2). A 15–30-min treatment of the cells with 100 nm PMA led to a marked down-regulation of hCAT-1·EGFP expressed in the plasma membrane. In contrast, the subcellular distribution did not change upon treatment of cells with Me2SO alone. To quantify the cell surface expression of hCAT-1, cell surface proteins were biotinylated and separated from internal proteins using avidin-coated beads. Western blot analysis demonstrated a reduction of hCAT-1·EGFP in the cell surface protein fraction (75 ± 5% of control) but not in total cell lysates (100 ± 3% of control) (Fig. 3). The PMA effect on the cell surface expression was abolished in the presence of the PKC inhibitor BIM I (99 ± 4% of control). No signal for the cytosolic β-tubulin was detected in the cell surface protein fraction, confirming the efficiency of the separation method.Fig. 3Quantification of the PMA-induced internalization of hCAT-1·EGFP expressed in human U373MG glioblastoma cells. Confluent U373MG glioblastoma cells stably transfected with hCAT-1·EGFP and grown in 10-cm dishes were first treated for 30 min with 1 μm BIM I (BIM I lanes) or 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) alone (all other columns) and then for further 30 min as indicated with 0.15% Me2SO alone, 100 nm PMA, or 100 nm PMA plus 0.5 μm BIM I. The cell surface proteins were then biotinylated and separated from nonbiotinylated proteins as specified under “Experimental Procedures.” A, Western blot with total cell lysates (L) (15 μg/lane) and cell surface proteins (CS) separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and probed with an anti-GFP-antibody (upper panel) and subsequently with an anti-tubulin antibody as control (lower panel). B, protein expression was quantified by densitometry of five independent experiments (means ± S.E.). White bars, Me2SO control; black bars, PMA; gray bars, PMA plus BIM I. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance with the Bonferroni post hoc test. **, p value < 0.01 between samples treated with PMA only and with PMA plus BIM I; †††, p value < 0.001 between PMA-treated total cell lysates and cell surface proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transport studies measuring the initial uptake of 100 μml-[3H]arginine confirmed that the reduced cell surface expression of hCAT-1·EGFP in PMA-treated cells was accompanied by a reduction in the hCAT-1·EGFP-mediated transport rate (down to 57 ± 4%) (Fig. 4). Pretreatment with BIM I reduced the PMA effect significantly. PDBu, another PKC-activating phorbol ester, reduced the transport rate to a similar extent as PMA (down to 63 ± 4%). In contrast, BIM I in the absence of an active phorbol ester and the inactive phorbol ester 4α-PDD had no effect (103 ± 3% and 99 ± 5%, respectively). So far, our studies were performed on hCAT-1 overexpressed exogenously in X. laevis oocytes or human cells. We therefore aimed to confirm that the activation of PKC also causes an internalization of endogenously expressed hCAT-1. In a screen of various human cell lines, DLD-1 colon carcinoma cells exhibited the highest system y+-mediated transport rates and hCAT-1 expression (data not shown) and were therefore chosen for our analyses. Western blots with an antibody against the C terminus of hCAT-1 revealed no significant changes in hCAT-1 protein expression in total lysates of cells treated either with Me2SO alone, PMA alone, or PMA plus BIM I (Fig. 5). In contrast, the cell surface expression of hCAT-1 was markedly reduced in PMA-treated cells (55 ± 8% of control). No significant reduction was seen when cells were exposed to PMA together with BIM I (89 ± 11%). Reversibility of the PMA-mediated Reduction in Arginine Transport—Measurements of arginine transport in DLD-1 colon carcinoma cells were performed in the presence of 2 mm cold leucine to block arginine transport mediated by transport systems other than hCAT-1 (Figs. 6 and 7). Only the PKC-activating phorbol esters PMA und PDBu lead to a significant reduction in arginine transport (73 ± 5 and 72 ± 4% of control, respectively). The simultaneous presence of BIM I abolished the effect of both PMA and PDBu (107 ± 5 and 100 ± 6% of control, respectively). Neither BIM I alone nor 4α-PDD had an effect on the arginine transport rate. In cells pretreated with cyclohexamide (10 μg/ml) for 3 h, the PMA-induced reduction of arginine transport was not larger than in cells with intact protein synthesis, indicating that PMA does not accelerate the breakdown of hCAT-1 (Fig. 7A). An unaltered hCAT-1 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. In addition, washout experiments demonstrated that the PMA effect was reversible within 1 h (Fig. 7B). The hCAT-1 protein did not increase over time during the washout period, indicating that the recovery of transport activity was not due to accelerated synthesis of hCAT-1.Fig. 7The PMA effect on hCAT-1-mediated transport is reversible. Uptake of 100 μm l-[3H]arginine was measured in confluent DLD-1 cells as specified in the legend to Fig. 6. Western blots were performed with total cell lysates (60 μg/lane (A) or 100 μg/lane (B)) from confluent DLD-1 colon carcinoma cells grown in 6-well plates. A, upper panel, transport rate of cells incubated with cyclohexamide (Chx, 10 μg/ml) 3 h prior and during a 1-h dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (0.1%) or PMA (100 nm) treatment. Cells treated with Me2SO but not with Chx were used as a control. Lower panels, a representative Western blot of cells treated as specified for the respective uptake measurement, probed with an anti-hCAT-1-antibody and subsequently with an antitubulin antibody as control. B, upper panel, transport rate of cells treated first for 1 h with Me2SO (D) or with PMA (P) (first treatment) and then (second treatment) for further 1 h (white box) or 2 h (gray box) with Me2SO or PMA. Before PMA was replaced by Me2SO only in the incubation medium (washout experiments), the cells were washed two times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Lower panels, a representative Western blot of cells treated as specified for the respective uptake measurement, probed with an anti-hCAT-1-antibody, and subsequently probed with an anti-tubulin antibody as control. The columns represent the means ± S.E. (n = 21–30). Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance with the Bonferroni post hoc test. *, p value < 0.05; **, p value < 0.01; ***, p value < 0.001; ns, p > 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Indirect Action of PKC on hCAT-1—To elucidate whether PKC directly phosphorylates hCAT-1, we removed all potential PKC phosphorylation sites by mutation of the respective serine residues (amino acids 476, 482, and 557) to alanine. Stable expression of the mutant hCAT-1 fused to EGFP (hCAT-1S476A/S482A/S557A/pEGFP-N1) in U373MG cells revealed a similar subcellular distribution as observed for the wild type hCAT-1 in all independent cell clones (supplemental figure, panels B and C). Also, the transport activity was comparable for both mutant and wild type hCAT-1 (supplemental figure, panel D). A 15–30-min treatment with 100 nm PMA lead to a similar down-regulation in cell surface expression of the mutated transporter as observed for the wild type hCAT-1 (Fig. 8). Again, the subcellular distribution of the mutant did not change after treatment with Me2SO alone. In addition, PMA treatment lead to an undiminished reduction in arginine transport mediated by the mutant hCAT-1 expressed in U373MG cells. This reduction was dependent on the activation of PKC (Fig. 9A). Similarly, the arginine transport in X. laevis oocytes mediated by the mutant hCAT-1 was inhibited to a similar extent as observed for the wild type transporter (Fig. 9B).Fig. 9The transport activity of hCAT-1S476A/S482A/S557A is also reduced"

We studied the effects of L11 knock-out and truncation mutations on the structure of the rRNA in this region and on its interactions with a translation elongation factor and the antibiotic thiostrepton. The results indicated that the structure of the L11-binding rRNA becomes conformationally flexible when ribosomes lack the entire L11 protein, but not when the C-terminal domain is present on ribosomes. Probing wild type and mutant ribosomes in the presence of the antibiotic thiostrepton and elongation factor-G (EF-G) rigorously localized the binding cleft of thiostrepton and suggested a role for the rRNA in the L11-binding domain in modulating factor binding. Our results also provide evidence that the structure of the rRNA stabilized by the C-terminal domain of L11 is necessary to stabilize EF-G binding in the post-translocation state, and thiostrepton may modulate this structure in a manner that interferes with the ribosome-EF-G interaction.

However, as thiostrepton appears to interact with both L11 and its 23S rRNA-binding domain (21Porse B.T. Leviev I. Mankin A.S. Garrett R.A. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it is not clear if a function of the protein or the rRNA is affected. Such apparently conflicting results emphasize a need for determining the structural basis and conformational requirements of the L11-rRNA domain that govern factor interactions during translation and its inhibition by thiostrepton. With this in mind, we examined the effects on 23S rRNA structure, thiostrepton binding, and EF-G interactions in E. coli mutants that lack functional endogenous L11 (11Van Dyke N. Xu W. Murgola E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), mutants lacking L11 that were supplemented with an inducible plasmid bearing the entire L11 coding sequence (11Van Dyke N.

Biol. 2003; 330: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), or mutants bearing a control plasmid without the L11 coding sequence (Table I). Important structural changes were identified by using chemical modification techniques and by comparing the results from the mutant ribosomes in the presence and absence of thiostrepton with results from ribosomes from the isogenic parent strain (Table I) and from ribosomes from which the ribosomal proteins had been extracted. To analyze the effects of the mutations on EF-G interactions with the ribosomes, we probed both pre- and post-translocation complexes of EF-G on the ribosome and compared the results for wild type and mutant ribosomes.Table IStrains used for isolation of 70S ribosomes with ribosomal protein L11 mutationsStrainDesignationRelevant genotypeReferenceNVD001Wild type (wt)wt L11 chromosomal gene (rplK)/pΔCAT (control plasmid)11Van Dyke N.

Also, when all proteins except L11 are present, the L11-binding domain on the 50S subunit becomes conformationally flexible, but not on those ribosomes retaining only the C-terminal domain of L11. Both L11 and thiostrepton binding to rRNA on the 50S subunit induce significant tertiary structure changes in the L11-binding region. Thiostrepton-induced structural changes were proximal to the presumed thiostrepton binding site (5Egebjerg J. Douthwaite S. Garrett R.A.

Finally, probing results in the presence of EF-G showed significant differences in the interactions of the factor with wild type and mutant ribosomes in the factor binding domains in the pre- and post-translocation states, revealing that the L11-stabilized structure of the rRNA is critically important for EF-G interactions in the post-translocation state. L11 Mutant Strains—Bacterial strains used in the study were derived from E. coli K-12 (Table I). Chromosomal L11 gene (rplK) knockout mutants of E. coli-carrying plasmids for inducible (Ptac promoter) in vivo expression of the entire L11 protein from E. coli (L11-/+) (11Van Dyke N. Xu W.

Ribosomes from each strain were purified from frozen cells essentially as described previously (27Tam M.F. Dodd J.A. Hill W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6430-6434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lodmell J.S. Tapprich W.E. Hill W.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4067-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After isolation, L11-, L11N-, L11-/+, and wild type ribosomes could not be distinguished upon sucrose gradient centrifugation or analytical ultracentrifugation (data not shown), indicating that mutant ribosomes assembled normally. Naked rRNAs were prepared by phenol-chloroform extraction as described (29Bowen W.S. Hill W.E. Lodmell J.S. Methods. 2001; 25: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Prior to probing, ribosomes (25 pmol) were activated by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgOAc, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol buffer (H50M5K100D1) with or without the addition of thiostrepton in Me2SO to the desired final concentration (1% Me2SO). Controls were made 1% in Me2SO. Chemical Probing—Chemical probing with dimethyl sulfate (DMS), 2-keto-3-ethoxybutyraldehyde (kethoxal), or 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimidemetho-p-toluenesulfonate (CMCT) were carried out in a manner adapted from Christensen et al. (30Christiansen J. Egebjerg N.L. Larsen N. Garrett R.A. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 229-248Google Scholar): 1 μl of 1:10 dilution of DMS in EtOH, 50 μl of 42 mg/ml CMCT in 1× H50M7K100D1 buffer, or 5 μl of 40 mg/ml kethoxal in 20% EtOH was added to samples followed by incubation for 5 min for DMS samples, 30 min for DMCT samples, or 10 min for kethoxal samples, respectively, at 37 °C. The samples were precipitated and phenol-chloroform was extracted in preparation for use as templates for reverse transcriptase primer extension and PAGE analysis (31Muth G.W. Thompson C.M. Hill W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1906-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32Stern S. Moazed D. Noller H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Probing of thiostrepton titrations was carried out in the same manner as above with the addition of increasing amount of antibiotic in 100% Me2SO (final concentration of Me2SO was 2% in reactions to aid thiostrepton solubility at higher concentrations). Purification of EF-G from E. coli—His6-tagged EF-G on a pET24b-fusA plasmid was a generous gift of K. Lieberman and H. F. Noller and was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) by growing in LB with 30 μg of kanamycin at 37 °C to late log phase, inducing expression with the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and growth for 4 more hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen for storage. His6-EF-G was isolated as described (33Wilson K.S. Noller H.F. Cell. 1998; 92: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 34Wilson K.S. Nechifor R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 1) cell lysis was performed by grinding 10 g of frozen cells with 20 g of baked alumina; 2) EF-G bound to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column was washed with 25 ml of buffer containing 10 mm imidazole (pH 8) before elution of protein. Binding of EF-G Complex to 70S Ribosomes—Increasing concentrations of 70S ribosomes in 50 μl of 1× H50M7K100D1 buffer were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 0.5 μg/μl poly-U mRNA (Sigma) followed by the addition of tRNAPhe to 1.5 μm and incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. To these pre-translocation complexes were added fusidic acid to 0.2 mm, [α-32P]GTP (Amersham Biosciences) to 0.5 mm, and EF-G to 2 μm, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. 45 μl of the reaction was filtered through 45-μm nitrocellulose filters and washed with 1 ml of ice-cold 1× H50M7K100D1 buffer. The percentage of ribosomes with bound EF-G complex was quantified by scintillation counting of washed filters and by calculating the concentration of retained radioactive signal from GDP in complex on ribosomes relative to controls incubated in the absence of ribosomes. Probing EF-G-ribosome Complexes—Fusidic acid or GDPNP-stabilized EF-G-ribosome complexes were constructed in a manner similar to Moazed and Noller (8Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 μm 70S wild type or mutant ribosomes in 1× H50M7K100D1 buffer were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C with 5 μg of poly-U mRNA (Sigma), followed by 10 min at 25 °C with 1.5 μm deacylated tRNAPhe from E. coli (Sigma). To these complexes were added either 0.5 mm GDP and 0.2 mm fusidic acid (Sigma) or 0.5 mm GDPNP (Sigma), followed by addition of EF-G to 2.5 μm and incubation at 25 °C for 10 min. The complexes were probed with DMS, kethoxal, and CMCT as above with minor deviations; probing temperature was 25 °C and no Me2SO was added to the reactions. Preparation of rRNA and primer extension analysis for probing reactions was as above for thiostrepton experiments. Chemical Probing of L11 Mutant Ribosomes—To determine whether the loss or truncation of L11 induced the loss of other ribosomal proteins, particularly the adjacent pentameric complex (L10-(L7/L12)2) (2Beauclerk A.A. Cundliffe E. Dijk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6559-6563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rosendahl G. Douthwaite S. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 2717-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) from ribosomes, we compared the reactivities of several nucleotides in the region associated with pentameric complex binding, including C1044, A1046, G1047, A1050, G1110, A1111, and G1112. These reactivities did not differ between the wild type and mutant (L11N- and L11-) ribosomes (Fig. 1, a–c, lanes 2–6). Importantly, the reactivity of nucleotide A1046, previously shown to interact directly with L10 upon pentameric complex binding (36Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2001; 107: 679-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 37Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar), did not change in the L11- or L11N- ribosomes. These results corroborate previous results using two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis (24Van Dyke N. Murgola E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which showed all proteins present except L11. When all proteins were extracted from the rRNA, the reactivity of C1044, A1046, A1048, C1109, G1110, A1111, and G1112, as well as several residues on both sides of the lower D helix and throughout the entire rRNA domain differed markedly from the reactivities found for wild type and mutant ribosomes (Fig. 2, a–d). The regional changes are presumably due to the loss of pentameric complex (L10-(L7/L12)2) and ribosomal proteins L16, L13, L6, and L36 interactions (36Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Cell. 2001; 107: 679-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 37Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A.

Science. 1999; 285: 2095-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The reactivities of residues in the L11-binding region in L11- and L11N- mutant ribosomes were clearly different from those on wild type ribosomes. The nucleotides in the L11-binding region that had altered reactivities on L11- ribosomes included those residues possibly involved in direct interactions with the protein (A1088, U1082, U1061, and A1070) (1Wimberly B.T. Guymon R. McCutcheon J.P. White S.W. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1999; 97: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 39Conn G.L. Draper D.E. Lattman E.E. Gittis A.G. Science. 1999; 284: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and those potentially involved in tertiary interactions that stabilize the rRNA structure (U1066, G1068, G1071, U1083, A1089, U1094, and U1097) (19Draper D.E. Xing Y. Laing L.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, probing of L11N- ribosomes revealed only two nucleotides for which changes in reactivity could be traced exclusively to truncation of the N-terminal domain of L11. Nucleotide U1061 became hyper-reactive to CMCT in the absence of the N-terminal domain of L11 but displayed reactivity only slightly greater than that of wild type ribosomes for L11- ribosomes (Fig. 1b). This could be explained if U1061 is exposed in the rRNA structure stabilized by the C-terminal domain of L11, but is partially buried when the structure shifts in response to the absence of L11. Nucleotide A1070 became more reactive to DMS both in L11N- and L11- ribosomes (Fig. 1a). Changes in reactivity on L11- and L11N- ribosomes were not found outside of the L11-binding region of the rRNA. Thiostrepton Interactions with Mutant Ribosomes—Chemical probing in the presence of thiostrepton on wild type ribosomes indicated protections at several residues previously associated with binding of the antibiotic (5Egebjerg J. Douthwaite S. Garrett R.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Rosendahl G. Douthwaite S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and at several additional sites (Table II), including U1061 (CMCT), G1071 (Keth/DMS), and U1097 (CMCT). Probing of L11N- ribosomes, L11- ribosomes, and the extracted rRNA from ribosomes (Fig. 1, lanes 11–13) revealed only partial protection for L11N- ribosomes (∼40–50% protection relative to wild type at most residues) and L11- ribosomes (∼10–20%), and less than 10% protection for extracted rRNA relative to wild type in the presence of thiostrepton under the probing conditions. This is consistent with previous studies that showed a profound reduction in the affinity of thiostrepton for 23S rRNA versus intact ribosomes (6Thompson J. Cundliffe E. Stark M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Cundliffe E. Hardesty B. Kramer G. Structure, Function, and Genetics of Ribosomes. Springer-Verlag, New York1986: 586-604Google Scholar). Therefore, we anticipated saturation of thiostrepton protection near wild type levels for mutant ribosomes at higher levels of antibiotic. However, protection levels on mutant ribosomes never reached the levels of wild type ribosomes. This may be explained if antibiotic binding on wild type ribosomes is dependent upon interactions with the N-terminal domain of L11 (21Porse B.T. Leviev I. Mankin A.S. Garrett R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Lentzen G. Klinck R. Matassova N. Aboul-ela F. Murchie A.I. Chem.

This may be attributable to an interaction between the N-terminal domain of L11 and the rRNA upon thiostrepton binding, as is suggested in the crystal structure of the L11-rRNA complex (1Wimberly B.T. Guymon R. McCutcheon J.P. White S.W. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1999; 97: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 6B). To test this, we added increasing amounts of thiostrepton to wild type and mutant ribosomes and probed them with modifiers as above. The results from a representative experiment for protection at A1067 are shown in Fig. 3. In most cases, wild type ribosomes were protected more than mutant ribosomes at a given concentration of thiostrepton, saturating above 5 μm (Fig. 3). Both U1061 and A1070 are protected by thiostrepton on wild type and L11N- ribosomes. However, that protection is completely lost on L11- ribosomes. Nucleotide U1097 is the only residue that is protected by thiostrepton on wild type ribosomes, but that is not protected on either L11N- or L11- ribosomes. This indicates that tightening of the L11-rRNA junction probably occurs only near the proximal apices of the A1 and C stem-loops of the rRNA and the N-terminal domain of L11 (Fig. 6B).Fig. 3Protection of rRNA residue A1067 by thiostrepton binding to ribosomes. Wild type or ribosomes with deletions or truncations of ribosomal protein L11 were incubated with increasing concentration of thiostrepton, were probed with DMS, and were analyzed for the protection of residues from chemical modification.

https://openalex.org/W2042437382,"We have previously shown evidence for the existence of a calcium-independent, GTP-regulated mechanism of secretion from neutrophils, but this secretory mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), the various substrates of which include Munc18 and synapsin 1, has been implicated in neuronal secretion. Although the Cdk5 activator, p35, and Cdk5-p35 activity are primarily associated with neurons, we report here that p35 also exists in neutrophils and that an active Cdk5-p35 complex is present in these cells. Cdk5-p35 activity in human neutrophils is mostly localized in secretory granules, which show an increase in Cdk5-p35 level and activity upon GTP stimulation. The potent Cdk5 inhibitor, roscovitine, completely blocks GTP-stimulated granule Cdk5 activity, which accompanies lactoferrin secretion from neutrophil-specific granules. Roscovitine also inhibits GTP-induced lactoferrin secretion and surface localization of the secretion markers, CD63 and CD66b, to a certain extent. Furthermore, neutrophils from wild-type mice treated with roscovitine and neutrophils from p35–/– mice exhibit comparable surface expression levels of both CD63 and CD66b upon GTP stimulation. Although our data suggest that other molecules control GTP-induced secretion from neutrophils, it is clear that Cdk5-p35 is required to elicit the maximum GTP-induced secretory response. Our observation that multiple proteins in neutrophil granules serve as specific substrates of Cdk5 further supports the premise that the kinase is a key component of the GTP-regulated secretory apparatus in neutrophils.

To effectively function in host defense, neutrophils secrete bactericidal proteins and proteolytic enzymes that destroy invading pathogens. Nucleotides such as ATP, ATPγS, 1The abbreviations used are: ATPγS, adenosine-5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate; AppNHp, 5-adenylyl-imidodiphosphate; SO, streptolysin O; wt, wild-type. UTP, ITP, and AppNHp, have previously been shown to promote secretion from neutrophil granules (1Cockcroft S. Stutchfield J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). By using a streptolysin O (SO)-permeabilized cell system, we have determined that a GTP-dependent mechanism of secretion also exists in neutrophils (2Rosales J.L. Ernst J.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 80: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Such mechanism requires GTP hydrolysis to stimulate secretion in the presence or absence of calcium. Several proteins have been implicated in regulating secretion from neutrophils, including the small ras-related GTPases (3Ambruso D.R. Knall C. Abell A.N. Panepinto J. Kurkchubasche A. Thurman G. Gonzalez-Aller C. Hiester A. deBoer M. Harbeck R.J. Oyer R. Johnson G.L. Roos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4654-4659Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 4Kaldi K.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 434-443PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of both p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 has also been demonstrated in ATP- and UTP-stimulated neutrophils (7Meshki J. Tuluc F. Bredetean O. Ding Z. Kunapuli S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C264-C271Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), supporting an important role for kinases in nucleotide-induced secretion. In this study, we begin to identify the protein effectors of the GTP-mediated secretory machinery in neutrophils. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a small proline-directed serine/threonine kinase that has close structural homology to other Cdks (8Lew J. Wang J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 33-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Unlike other Cdks, however, the cellular functions of Cdk5 are seemingly unrelated to the cell cycle. In addition, activation of Cdk5 requires association with its non-cyclin regulatory partner, p35 (or its truncated form, p25) (8Lew J. Wang J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 33-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 9Lee K.Y. Qi Z. Yu Y.P. Wang J.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), or its isoform, p39 (10Tang D. Yeung J. Lee K.Y. Matsushita M. Matsui H. Tomizawa K. Hatase O. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26897-26903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Cdk5 is most abundant in neurons and its activators, p35 and p39, have been presumed to be neuron-specific. Although Cdk5 activity has generally been associated with brain, recent studies have implicated a role for Cdk5 in other tissues such as muscle (11Lazaro J.B. Kitzmann M. Poul M.A. Vandromme M. Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sahlgren C.M. Mikhailov A. Vaittinen S. Pallari H.M. Kalimo H. Pant H.C. Eriksson J.E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1224-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It seems that Cdk5 modulates cell differentiation and certain cellular functions. For example, Cdk5 phosphorylation of the syntaxin binding Munc18 (15Fletcher A.I. Shuang R. Giovannucci D.R. Zhang L. Bittner M.A. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4027-4035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which has been suggested to regulate the assembly of the SNARE complex (16Voets T. Toonen R.F.

Neuron. 2001; 31: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and believed to be an essential component of the secretion machinery, has implicated Cdk5 in neuronal secretion. An increasing line of evidence also demonstrates Cdk5 as a modulator of neurocytoskeletal dynamics (17Rashid T. Banerjee M. Nikolic M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49043-49052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Smith D. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Qi R.Z. Ching Y.P. Kung H.F. Wang J.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 561: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which play an essential role in regulated secretion. Previous studies have shown that neutrophils share some secretory mechanisms with neurons. In this study, the possibility that Cdk5 participates in the regulation of the calcium-independent GTP-mediated secretion from neutrophils was investigated using SO-permeabilized cells. We show for the first time that Cdk5 and its known neuronal activator, p35, are present in neutrophils and that p35-associated Cdk5 activity is present in these cells as well. Cdk5 activity, which is most abundant in neutrophil granules, increases with GTP stimulation and secretion from specific granules. The potent Cdk5 inhibitor, roscovitine, inhibits such effects. In accord with these findings, we found two neutrophil granule proteins that serve as effective substrates of Cdk5. Together, our observations suggest that Cdk5 plays an important role in regulating GTP-mediated secretion from neutrophils. Neutrophil Isolation, Permeabilization, and Stimulation—Neutrophils obtained from normal human volunteers and mice (p35–/– and corresponding wt; ref. 20Hallows J.L. Chen K. DePinho R.A. Vincent I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10633-10644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared and permeabilized as described previously (5Rosales J.L. Ernst J.D. J.

In brief, permeabilization using SO (Murex Diagnostics Inc., Norcross, GA) was performed in two steps: 1) SO binding at 4 °C for 10 min followed by washing to remove unbound SO, and 2) pore formation by resuspending cells in prewarmed (37 °C) permeabilization buffer and incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Stimulation with 300 μm GTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) in the presence or absence of 20 μm roscovitine (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) was performed simultaneously with the second step of permeabilization. Incubation at 37 °C was continued for an additional 15 min after the pore formation step. Cells treated with roscovitine during GTP stimulation were also pre-incubated with 20 μm roscovitine for 30 min at RT before permeabilization. PCR/RT-PCR—To detect the specific PCR products of Cdk5 (650 bp) and p35 (450 bp), cDNAs generated from RNAs (isolated using the RNeasy® mini kit; Qiagen) by RT reaction (using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase; Invitrogen) were used as templates for PCR reactions. PCR was carried out using Taq from Invitrogen. The following primers were used: Cdk5 forward primer (TGAGGGTGTGCCAAGTTCAGC) and reverse primer (GGCATTGAGTTTGGGCACGAC); p35 forward primer (ACCTCTGCAGGGACACCCAAACG) and reverse primer (GTGGGTCGGCATTGATCTGCAGC); and β-actin forward primer (GAACCCTAAGGCCAACCGTGA) and reverse primer (AGGAAAGGATGCGGCAGTGG). Preparation of Cell and Granule Lysates and Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were sonicated in HEPES buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) containing 2 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Samples were then processed to obtain the designated cell lysate or subcellular fractions. To prepare the cell lysates, sonicated samples were incubated with Triton X-100 (final concentration, 1%) and additional NaCl (final concentration, 800 mm) at 4 °C for 1 h on a rocker. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min was designated as cell lysate. To prepare the subcellular fractions, sonicated samples were centrifuged at 420 × g for 10 min to separate unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min to obtain the granule fraction. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain the membrane (pellet) and cytosol (supernatant) fractions. Granule lysates were prepared by sonication of the granule fraction in HEPES buffer A followed by incubation with 1% Triton X-100 and 800 mm NaCl for 1 h at 4 °C ona rocker. After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was designated as the granule lysate. Immunoprecipitation—To immunoprecipitate Cdk5 and p35, cell or granule lysates precleared with protein A/G plus agarose beads were incubated with fresh beads pre-adsorbed with an antibody to either Cdk5 (C-8 or DC-17) or p35 (C-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h on a rocker at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 2.6 mm KCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), probed with a primary antibody (C-8 or DC-17 anti-Cdk5, or C-19 anti-p35; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce Chemical). Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.15% bovine serum albumin were allowed to adhere to coverslips incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 30 min. The media was replaced gently with fresh Hanks' balanced salt solution/bovine serum albumin ± 20 μm roscovitine and incubation at 37 °C was continued for another 30 min. After rinsing with permeabilization buffer (Ref. 5Rosales J.L. Ernst J.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6195-6202PubMed Google Scholar), cells were incubated with prewarmed (37 °C) permeabilization buffer ± 300 μm GTP ± 20 μm roscovitine. After treatment, cells were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2, and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. After washing, cells were incubated with either the CD63 or CD66b antibody (monoclonal antibodies; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), washed, and incubated with a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, West Grove, PA). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides using the SlowFade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescence staining was visualized using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope, and images were acquired using a cooled charge-coupled device camera. Kinase Assay—Histone H1 (9Lee K.Y. Qi Z.

The amount of [γ-32P]phosphate incorporated into histone was measured using a Beckman LS 5000CE scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Phosphorylation Assay—Isolated granules from 1 × 107 cells per treatment were subjected to dephosphorylation using a modified version of what we described previously (23Rosales J.L. Nodwell M.J. Johnston R.N. Lee K.Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In brief, samples were incubated with 20 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Pfizer, New York, NY) for 2 h at 37 °C. Dephosphorylation was stopped by incubating the samples at 70 °C for 15 min, which also inactivates endogenous kinases and phosphatases. Phosphorylation of granule proteins by Cdk5 was then performed by incubating the dephosphorylated granule samples with a Cdk5 immunoprecipitate (from a neutrophil lysate) ± 20 μm roscovitine in the presence of 30 μm [γ-32P]ATP in kinase assay buffer (22Lee K.Y. Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 40 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were then resolved in a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and phosphorylation of granule proteins detected by autoradiography. Miscellaneous—Quantitation of the extent of permeabilization and secretion of lactoferrin into the extracellular medium was performed as we described previously (5Rosales J.L. Ernst J.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6195-6202PubMed Google Scholar). Control mouse brain samples were homogenized in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain and aprotinin, 0.3 mg/ml benzamidine, and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) using a tissue homogenizer (CH-6010; Kinematica, Kriens-Luzern, Switzerland). Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford microassay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). p35-associated Cdk5 Activity Is Present in Neutrophils—Previous investigations have implicated a role for Cdk5 in regulated secretion from neurons (15Fletcher A.I. Shuang R. Giovannucci D.R. Zhang L. Bittner M.A. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4027-4035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Shuang R. Zhang L. Fletcher A. Groblewski G.E. Pevsner J. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4957-4966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) where the kinase is found to have remarkable activity. To investigate the possibility that Cdk5 participates in the regulation of secretion from neutrophils, we initially examined human neutrophils for the expression of transcripts of Cdk5 and its known neuronal activator, p35. As shown in Fig. 1A, RT-PCR revealed the presence of transcripts of the ubiquitous Cdk5 (left) and the more tissue-specific p35 (right) in human neutrophils. The presence of p35 is supported by parallel analysis of brain cDNA from p35–/– (negative control) and corresponding wt (positive control) mice. Because p35 is an intronless single exon gene, genomic DNA contamination will result in a false positive PCR product. To prove that the PCR product was, indeed, derived from p35 cDNA from the RT reaction and not from potential genomic DNA contamination, isolated RNA was used as template for the p35 PCR negative control reaction (lane 3). RT-PCR amplification with rat β-actin gene primers spanning intron II was used to confirm the success of RT reactions using cDNA as template (bottom). Western blot analysis revealed that both Cdk5 (Fig. 1B, lane 2, left) and p35 (Fig. 1B, lane 2, right) proteins are also present in neutrophils. Cdk5 immunoprecipitates from neutrophil lysates also showed a considerable amount of histone H1 kinase activity (Fig. 1C, bar 2), indicating that Cdk5 exists as an active kinase in neutrophils as well. Cdk5-p35 Activity in Neutrophils Is Mostly Associated with the Secretory Granules—Secretion from neutrophil granules results from the fusion of granule membranes with the plasma membrane, implying important roles for certain molecules in these subcellular compartments during the secretory process. To examine whether Cdk5-p35 localizes in the granule and/or membrane compartments of neutrophils, the kinase was immunoprecipitated from neutrophil subcellular fractions using a p35 antibody (C-19). Western blotting showed that although Cdk5 levels are comparable in the membrane and granule fractions (Fig. 2A), a much higher level of Cdk5 from the granule fraction coimmunoprecipitates with p35 (Fig. 2B), indicating the formation of a Cdk5-p35 complex in neutrophils that is most abundant in granules. The level of Cdk5-p35 in the subcellular compartments correlates with the level of Cdk5 kinase activity (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it seems that Cdk5-p35 in neutrophils has an important function in granules and, potentially, in the secretion of granule contents. GTP Stimulates Granule Cdk5-p35 Activity That Accompanies Lactoferrin Secretion—Because Cdk5-p35 activity in neutrophils is mostly associated with the secretory granules, we sought to examine a potential role for the kinase in GTP-dependent secretion from SO-permeabilized neutrophils. As shown in Fig. 3A, GTP stimulation elicited an increase in Cdk5-p35 kinase activity in neutrophil granules. It seems that such an increase in kinase activity is caused by an increase in Cdk5-p35 level (Fig. 3A, inset). Although roscovitine, a potent Cdk5 inhibitor (26Bibb J.A. Chen J. Taylor J.R. Svenningsson P. Nishi A. Snyder G.L. Yan Z. Sagawa Z.K. Ouimet C.C. Nairn A.C. Nestler E.J. Greengard P. Nature. 2001; 410: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), did not inhibit the association of Cdk5 with p35 (Fig. 3A, inset, lane 3), it completely inhibited the kinase activity of the p35 immunoprecipitate, suggesting that the increase in histone kinase activity in granules was in fact caused by Cdk5-p35. We then examined whether GTP-stimulated lactoferrin secretion from specific granules can also be inhibited by roscovitine. As shown in Fig. 3B, roscovitine caused inhibition of GTP-stimulated lactoferrin secretion from specific granules. The incomplete effect of roscovitine suggests that other molecules regulate the secretion of lactoferrin. Nonetheless, it seems that participation of Cdk5-p35 is essential for maximum GTP-stimulated secretion from specific granules. Neutrophils from p35–/– Mice Display Reduced GTP-stimulated Surface Localization of CD63 and CD66b—Because we also detected both Cdk5 (Fig. 4B, left) and p35 (Fig. 4B, middle) transcripts in mouse neutrophils, the relevance of p35-associated Cdk5 activity in secretion by GTP-stimulated neutrophils was further examined using cells from p35–/– mice and their corresponding wt. Secretion was assessed by analyzing the surface expression of CD63 and CD66b, which have been shown as effective markers of secretion from azurophil and specific granules, respectively (27de Haas M. Kerst J.M. van der Schoot C.E. Calafat J. Hack C.E. Nuijens J.H. Roos D. van Oers R.H. von dem Borne A. E Blood. 1994; 84: 3885-3894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lard L.R. Mul F.P. de Haas M. Roos D. Duits A.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Tapper H. Grinstein S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 409-418PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, GTP stimulation resulted in an obvious increase in surface expression of both CD63 and CD66b in wt neutrophils. Such effect of GTP in wt neutrophils is partially inhibited by roscovitine treatment. In p35–/– mouse neutrophils, GTP stimulation resulted in CD63 and CD66b surface expression that is comparable with that of roscovitine-treated GTP-stimulated wt neutrophils. The partial induction of surface expression of the CD63 and CD66b secretion markers in GTP plus roscovitine-treated neutrophils from wt mice and in GTP-treated neutrophils from p35–/– mice corroborates our finding that roscovitine partially inhibits lactoferrin secretion from human neutrophils (Fig. 3B). Together, our observations suggest that although GTP-stimulated secretion from neutrophils may occur in the absence of Cdk5-p35 activity, the maximum GTP-induced secretory response from both the azurophil and specific granules could only be achieved in the presence of Cdk5-p35 activity. Cdk5 Has Two Major Substrates in Neutrophil Granules— Because our findings demonstrate the regulation of GTP-dependent secretion from neutrophil granules by Cdk5, it is likely that at least one granule protein that also plays a role in GTP-mediated secretion serves as a substrate for Cdk5. Indeed, by phosphorylation assay, we found multiple granule proteins that were phosphorylated by Cdk5 (Fig. 5, lane 3). Two of these granule proteins, which have apparent molecular masses of ∼49 and ∼54 kDa, were intensely phosphorylated by Cdk5, suggesting that both proteins act as major substrates of Cdk5. The presence of roscovitine inhibited the phosphorylation of these granule proteins (Fig. 5, lane 4), indicating the specificity of phosphorylation by Cdk5. Phosphorylation of at least one of these proteins by Cdk5 may have a crucial role in GTP-mediated secretion from neutrophil granules. Further characterization of these 49- and 54-kDa proteins is in progress. Although Cdk5 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, Cdk5 activity has mostly been associated with the brain tissue, where the Cdk5 activators, p35 and p39, were initially found. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that p35-associated Cdk5 activity is present in neutrophils as well. Neutrophils offer the first line of defense against infection and are potent effectors of inflammation. To achieve these functions, neutrophils generate reactive oxygen intermediates and secrete proteolytic enzymes. However, the components of the neutrophil secretory apparatus and their specific functions are not yet well characterized. We have previously shown that a calcium-independent GTP-mediated mechanism of secretion exists in neutrophils (2Rosales J.L. Ernst J.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 80: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrate that Cdk5-p35 is an important component of the GTP-induced secretory machinery in neutrophils. Our observation that Cdk5-p35 expression and activity in neutrophils is mostly associated with secretory granules suggests that the kinase has a relevant function in this subcellular compartment. Increased Cdk5-p35 level and activity in neutrophil granules upon GTP stimulation supports this notion. These findings are consistent with the observation in neuroendocrine cells whereby stimulation of secretion corresponds to a rapid translocation of cytosolic Cdk5 to the particulate fraction as well as an increase in Cdk5 kinase activity (15Fletcher A.I. Shuang R. Giovannucci D.R. Zhang L. Bittner M.A. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4027-4035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The complete inhibition of GTP-stimulated kinase activity in granules by roscovitine substantiates the premise that the increase in kinase activity is specific to Cdk5. Inhibition of GTP-stimulated lactoferrin secretion by roscovitine further points to a role for Cdk5 in GTP-mediated secretion from neutrophils. This concurs with the inhibitory effect of roscovitine on the GTP-stimulated increase in surface expression of CD63 and CD66b in neutrophils. This increase in plasma membrane expression of CD63 and CD66b has been shown in the past to closely correlate with conventional assays of secretion from neutrophil azurophil and specific granules, respectively (30Niessen H.W. Verhoeven A.J. Cell Signal. 1992; 4: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31Kuijpers T.W. Tool A.T. van der Schoot C.E. Ginsel L.A. Onderwater J.J. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although roscovitine may cause some inhibitory effect on the cell cycle Cdk1 and Cdk2, such effect may be disregarded in secretion by terminally differentiated neutrophils. The partial effect of roscovitine on GTP-induced secretion from human and mouse neutrophils is consistent with the observations in GTP-stimulated p35–/– mouse neutrophils. It would seem that other molecules are involved in GTP-mediated secretion, but it also seems that participation of Cdk5-p35 is crucial to reach the maximum GTP-triggered secretory response. Our observations parallel a previous report that Cdk5-p35 acts as a positive regulator of insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells (32Lilja L. Yang S.N. Webb D.L. Juntti-Berggren L. Berggren P.O. Bark C. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 promotes insulin exocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34199-34205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Roscovitine or dominant-negative Cdk5 expression inhibits calcium-independent β cell secretion. It is interesting that in neutrophils, calcium-independent GTP-mediated secretion (2Rosales J.L. Ernst J.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 80: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) is also regulated by Cdk5. It is possible that the calcium-independent secretory mechanism in pancreatic β cells is analogous to that of the GTP-induced, calcium-independent secretory mechanism that exists in neutrophils. Perhaps Cdk5-p35 is one of the kinases responsible for the phosphorylation events that may be critical to achieve the maximum GTP-induced release of granule contents from neutrophils. Obvious phosphorylation of multiple granule proteins by Cdk5, particularly of the ∼49- and ∼54-kDa proteins, which seem to act as effective substrates of the kinase, may point to the possible targets of Cdk5 during GTP-induced secretion. At least one of the Cdk5 phosphorylated proteins may serve as an effector molecule for GTP-mediated secretion from neutrophil granules. This theory concurs with the finding that phosphorylation of the mammalian neuronal homologue of Sec1p, Munc18, by Cdk5 reduces its affinity to syntaxin1 (25Shuang R. Zhang L. Fletcher A. Groblewski G.E. Pevsner J. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4957-4966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), allowing the interaction between syntaxin1 and the other effectors of secretion. It seems that in pituitary cells, Cdk5 phosphorylation of the RhoGEF, Trio, is also involved in the actin dynamics required for endocrine cell secretion (33Xin X. Ferraro F. Back N. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Cdk5 and Trio modulate endocrine cell exocytosis.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4739-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is possible that in neutrophils, phosphorylation of the 49- and/or 54-kDa granule proteins by Cdk5 results in a positive interaction among the protein effectors of GTP-mediated secretion as well. Further studies are required to substantiate this premise. We thank Dr. Inez Vincent (University of Washington) for providing the p35–/– mice breeding pair."

Here we have defined the smallest overlapping regions of imbalance (SORI) in testicular germ cell tumors other than the 12p region, which has been previously investigated. Definition of the regions was achieved through comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis of a 4559 cDNA clone microarray. A total of 14 SORI were identified, which involved at least five of the 11 samples analysed. Many of these refined regions were previously reported using chromosomal or allelic imbalance studies. The SORI included gain of material from the regions 4q12, 17q21.3, 22q11.23 and Xq22, and loss from 5q33, 11q12.1, 16q22.3 and 22q11. Comparison with parallel chromosomal CGH data supported involvement of most regions. The various SORI span between one and 20 genes and highlight potential oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes to be investigated further."
https://openalex.org/W2050243123,"The heterotrimeric G-protein G(13) mediates the formation of primitive endoderm from mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells in response to retinoic acid, signaling to the level of activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase. The signal linkage map from MEKK1/MEKK4 to MEK1/MKK4 to JNK is obligate in this G alpha(13)-mediated pathway, whereas that between G alpha(13) and MEKKs is not known. The overall pathway to primitive endoderm formation was shown to be inhibited by treatment with Clostridium botulinum C3 exotoxin, a specific inactivator of RhoA family members. Constitutively active G alpha(13) was found to activate RhoA as well as Cdc42 and Rac1 in these cells. Although constitutively active Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA all can activate JNK1, only the RhoA mutant was able to promote formation of primitive endoderm, mimicking expression of the constitutively activated G alpha(13). Expression of the constitutively active mutant form of p115RhoGEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) was found to activate RhoA and JNK1 activities. Expression of the dominant negative p115RhoGEF was able to inhibit activation of both RhoA and JNK1 in response to either retinoic acid or the expression of a constitutively activated mutant of G alpha(13). Expression of the dominant negative mutants of RhoA as well as those of either Cdc42 or Rac1, but not Ras, attenuated G alpha(13)-stimulated as well as retinoic acid-stimulated activation of all three of these small molecular weight GTPases, suggesting complex interrelationships among the three GTPases in this pathway. The formation of primitive endoderm in response to retinoic acid also could be blocked by expression of dominant negative mutants of RhoA, Cdc42, or Rac1. Thus, the signal propagated from G alpha(13) to JNK requires activation of p115RhoGEF cascades, including p115RhoGEF itself, RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1. In a concerted effort, RhoA in tandem with Cdc42 and Rac1 activates the MEKK1/4, MEK1/MKK4, and JNK cascade, thereby stimulating formation of primitive endoderm."
https://openalex.org/W1965404576,"The chromosomal translocation t(8;21) fuses the AML1 (RUNX1) gene on chromosome 21 and the ETO gene on chromosome 8 in human acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), resulting in expression of the chimeric transcription factor AML1/ETO. AML1/ETO-mediated dysregulation of target genes critical for hematopoietic differentiation and proliferation is thought to contribute to the leukemic phenotype. Several mechanisms, including recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs) to AML1 target genes, may be responsible for altered gene expression. We used an ecdysone-inducible expression system in the human monoblastic U-937 cell line to isolate genes that were differentially expressed upon induction of AML1/ETO expression. By representational difference analysis (cDNA-RDA), we identified 26 genes whose expression levels were significantly modulated following AML1/ETO induction for 48 h. None of these genes has previously been described as a target of AML1, ETO or AML1/ETO. One gene downregulated by AML1/ETO in vitro, Williams Beuren syndrome critical region 5 (WBSCR5), was expressed in primary t(8;21)-negative AML blasts but not in primary t(8;21)-positive AML blasts, strongly implying a role of this gene in the phenotype of t(8;21)-positive AML. Four upregulated and four downregulated genes were further studied with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), an inducer of differentiation of U-937 cells, and Trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC inhibitor. Three out of eight genes including WBSCR5 were regulated during ATRA-induced monocytic differentiation of U-937 cells, however, none of them antagonistically, upon both ATRA treatment and AML1/ETO induction. AML1/ETO-associated dysregulation of gene expression was not mediated by a TSA-sensitive mechanism. The identified genes provide a useful model to study the mechanism by which the AML1/ETO fusion protein exerts its function in transcriptional dysregulation in AML. The possible role of WBSCR5 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis warrants further study."
https://openalex.org/W1965925888,"The expression of the tumour suppressor protein fragile histidine triad (Fhit) is often impaired in many human cancers and its restoration in Fhit-negative cancer cell lines suppresses tumorigenicity and induces apoptosis. Although the proapoptotic function of Fhit is well documented, little is known about its precise mechanism of action and further studies are needed in order to elucidate the putative therapeutic properties of this protein. To this end, we have engineered the lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 in order to express different molecules involved in the control of apoptotic pathways. Infection of these cells with an adenoviral vector transducing the Fhit gene (Ad-Fhit) revealed that complete protection from apoptosis was conferred by the inhibitor of caspases Cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) and by a dominant-negative form of the adapter protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and partial protection by a dominant-negative form of caspase-8, while cells over expressing mitochondrial mediators of the apoptotic response such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) that are resistant to treatment with cisplatin, remained highly susceptible to cell death triggered by Fhit gene transfer. In line to what was observed in H460 cells, Ad-Fhit efficacy was not affected by Bcl-2 overexpression also in two other lung cancer cell lines (A549 and Calu-1). Analysis of cytochrome c release also confirmed that in Bcl-2- or Bcl-x(L)-expressing cells apoptosis could be detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay before any evidence of mitochondrial membrane perturbation. In conclusion, our analysis indicates that the Fhit protein exerts its oncosuppressor activity through induction of an apoptotic mechanism that seems to be FADD dependent, caspase-8 mediated and independent from mitochondrial amplification."
https://openalex.org/W2170686722,"An important role of the cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin A1 in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was previously demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model. We have now turned our attention to study specific aspects of the activity and subcellular distribution of cyclin A1 using bone marrow samples from normal donors and patients with AML, as well as leukemic cell lines. We show that the localization of cyclin A1 in normal hematopoietic cells is nuclear, whereas in leukemic cells from AML patients and cell lines, it is predominantly cytoplasmic. In leukemic cell lines treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), cyclin A1 localized to the nucleus. Further, there was a direct interaction between cyclin A1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1, as well as a major ATRA receptor, RARα, in ATRA-treated cells but not in untreated leukemic cells. Our results indicate that the altered intracellular distribution of cyclin A1 in leukemic cells correlates with the status of the leukemic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2105470905,"The receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ (PTPμ) is a homophilic adhesion protein thought to regulate cell-cell adhesion in the vascular endothelium through dephosphorylation of cell junction proteins. In subconfluent cell cultures, PTPμ resides in an intracellular membrane pool; however, as culture density increases and cell contacts form, the phosphatase localizes to sites of cell-cell contact, and its expression level increases. These characteristics of PTPμ, which are consistent with a role in cell-cell adhesion, suggest that control of subcellular localization is an important mechanism to regulate the function of this phosphatase. To gain a better understanding of how PTPμ is regulated, we examined the importance of the conserved immunoglobulin domain, containing the homophilic binding site, in control of the localization of the enzyme. Deletion of the immunoglobulin domain impaired localization of PTPμ to the cell-cell contacts in endothelial and epithelial cells. In addition, deletion of the immunoglobulin domain affected the distribution of PTPμ in subconfluent endothelial cells when homophilic binding to another PTPμ molecule on an apposing cell was not possible, resulting in an accumulation of the mutant phosphatase at the cell surface with a concentration at the cell periphery in the region occupied by focal adhesions. This aberrant localization correlated with reduced survival and alterations in normal focal adhesion and cytoskeleton morphology. This study therefore illustrates the critical role of the immunoglobulin domain in regulation of the localization of PTPμ and the importance of such control for the maintenance of normal cell physiology.

This study therefore illustrates the critical role of the immunoglobulin domain in regulation of the localization of PTPμ and the importance of such control for the maintenance of normal cell physiology. The physical interactions of individual cells with the local environment is critical to the control of their growth, differentiation, and fate within a multicellular organism. These responses are initiated by cell adhesion receptors, which bind either homophilic or heterophilic ligands on apposing cells or the extracellular matrix. A critical aspect in the cellular response to these interactions is reversible protein tyrosine phosphorylation of cell junction-associated proteins (1Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3583-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In fact, the bulk of the tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular proteins are localized to sites of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion. Several protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases have been implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion (3Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3811-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 4Harder K.W. Moller N.P. Peacock J.W. Jirik F.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). In particular, receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), 1The abbreviations used are: RPTPs, receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; trBAEC, transformed bovine aortic endothelial cells; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine; WT, wild-type; Ig, immunoglobulin; MEM, minimum essential media; VE-cadherin, vascular endothelial cadherin. several of which possess extracellular domains with features characteristic of cell adhesion receptors, linked to a cytoplasmic PTP activity, are uniquely designed to mediate cellular responses to adhesive signals through protein tyrosine dephosphorylation (7Brady-Kalnay S.M. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 8Beltran P.J. Bixby J.L. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: D87-D99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the potential for the extracellular domains of individual RPTPs to mediate interactions with, and control of, either cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix adhesions. In this way, the targeting of RPTPs to specific junctions may be a key element in controlling the changes in cell junction-actin cytoskeleton interactions that occur as cells transition from a growing, migrating state, in which actin stress fibers are linked to cell-matrix junctions, to contact-inhibited cells, in which actin fibers are linked primarily to cell-cell junctions (9Larsen M. Tremblay M.L. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 700-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study, we focus on the receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPμ. PTPμ is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain, which is then glycosylated and proteolytically cleaved at a site N-terminal to the transmembrane segment to give two subunits that remain noncovalently associated (10Brady-Kalnay S.M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28472-28477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gebbink M.F. Zondag G.C. Koningstein G.M. Feiken E. Wubbolts R.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The E-subunit (see Fig. 1A), which constitutes the majority of the extracellular segment, consists of one immunoglobulin (Ig) domain; four fibronectin type III repeats; and a MAM (Mu, A5, and meprin homology) domain, which is a conserved domain unique to PTPμ, PTPκ, PTPρ, and PTPλ and some cell adhesion molecules (12Beckmann G. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 40-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The P-subunit (see Fig. 1A) contains a short extracellular segment; the transmembrane segment; and the entire cytoplasmic portion, including two PTP domains. PTPμ can function as a homophilic adhesion receptor whereby a PTPμ molecule on one cell can bind to an identical PTPμ molecule on an apposing cell (13Brady-Kalnay S.M. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 14Gebbink M.F. Zondag G.C. Wubbolts R.W. Beijersbergen R.L. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16101-16104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is this binding that is proposed to direct the localization of PTPμ to sites of cell-cell contact, where it is thought to interact with the cadherin-catenin cell adhesion complex (11Gebbink M.F. Zondag G.C. Koningstein G.M. Feiken E. Wubbolts R.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role in cell-cell adhesion, the level of PTPμ protein increases as intercellular contacts are made and cell-cell junctions form (11Gebbink M.F. Zondag G.C. Koningstein G.M. Feiken E. Wubbolts R.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is seen with other RPTPs and may provide a means to control protein phosphotyrosine-based signaling in contact-inhibited cells (15Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 16Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ragab A. Ragab-Thomas J.M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PTPμ is expressed predominantly in vascular endothelial cells and to a lesser extent in bronchial epithelium and may play a role in endothelium-dependent processes such as the control of vascular permeability and the angiogenic responses to tumor formation and wound healing (19Bianchi C. Sellke F.W. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Considering the importance of PTPs in the control of signal transduction, it is critical that they be tightly regulated to facilitate protein tyrosine phosphorylation (20Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Based on studies with RPTPα, dimerization of RPTPs, which leads to occlusion of the active site, has been proposed as one mechanism for inhibition of phosphatase activity (21den Bilwes A.M. Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 22Majeti R. Bilwes A.M. Noel J.P. Hunter T. Weiss A.

However, it is not clear whether dimer-induced inhibition is widely applicable, as dimers formed in crystals of RPTP-LAR and RPTPμ are oriented such that the active sites are unobstructed (24Hoffmann K.M. Tonks N.K. Barford D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27505-27508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A number of studies indicate that the control of localization and substrate accessibility by intrinsic targeting domains is another important way to modulate cellular dephosphorylation by PTPs (20Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) such as PTPμ. In contrast to the structurally related LAR-subtype RPTPs (LAR, PTPσ, and PTPδ), which can be found in both cell-matrix and cell-cell contacts (26Aicher B. Lerch M.M. Muller T. Schilling J. Ullrich A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 681-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 28Wang J. Bixby J.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 370-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), PTPμ is thought to function exclusively at sites of cell-cell adhesion, where it has the potential to regulate signaling events specific to contact-inhibited cells. In subconfluent cells, PTPμ is thought to cycle between the plasma membrane and membrane vesicles in the perinuclear region of the cell (11Gebbink M.F. Zondag G.C. Koningstein G.M. Feiken E. Wubbolts R.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Although it has been proposed that stable surface expression is dependent upon homophilic binding at cell-cell contacts (11Gebbink M.F. Zondag G.C. Koningstein G.M. Feiken E. Wubbolts R.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the mechanism whereby PTPμ localization is controlled has not been defined. Previous studies using purified fusion proteins indicate that the conserved Ig domain is necessary and sufficient for homophilic binding of purified PTPμ fusion proteins as well as binding of the fusion proteins to the surface of cells expressing endogenous levels of PTPμ (10Brady-Kalnay S.M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28472-28477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have deleted the Ig domain of PTPμ and expressed the mutant protein in endothelial and epithelial cell lines to assess the role of this domain in regulating localization of the phosphatase. The results demonstrate the importance of the Ig domain for the localization of PTPμ to sites of cell-cell contact and also identify a role for this domain in localization of PTPμ in subconfluent cells in the absence of cell-cell contact. Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and the derived cell lines GM7372 and GM7373 (referred to here as transformed BAEC (trBAEC)) (29Grinspan J.B. Mueller S.N. Levine E.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 114: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ). The cells were grown in basal medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 1× MEM/essential and nonessential amino acid mixtures, 1× MEM/vitamin mixture, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (catalog no. CCL-34) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin. Construction of Retroviral Expression Plasmids—Human PTPμ (GenBank™/EBI accession number NM_002845) DNA constructs were cloned with a C-terminal T7 epitope tag (30Lutz-Freyermuth C. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6393-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) into the retroviral vector pWZL-hygro (provided by S. Lowe, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) by PCR with pBSK/hFL (31Gebbink M.F. van Etten I. Hateboer G. Suijkerbuijk R. Geurts Beijersbergen R.L. van Kessel A.G. Moolenaar W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) as the template. pWZL/PTPμWT contains nucleotides 1–4359 of human PTPμ; pWZL/PTPμΔIg and pWZL/PTPμΔE have deletions of nucleotides 568–930 and 67–1914, respectively, in human PTPμ. The resulting constructs encoded proteins with a C-terminal extension of AGMASMTGGQQMG, where the underlined amino acids define the T7 epitope tag. All constructs derived from PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression of PTPμ by Retroviral Infection—LiNX-A retroviral packaging cells (32Wang J. Xie L.Y. Allan S. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1769-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) were transfected with pWZL/PTPμ plasmid DNA using calcium phosphate. The resulting supernatants, containing recombinant retrovirus encoding PTPμ, were used to infect monolayer cultures of GM7372 cells, trBAEC, or MDCK cells. Two days following infection, cells were placed in the appropriate medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml (GM7372 cells) or 400 μg/ml (trBAEC and MDCK cells) hygromycin B (Invitrogen). The medium was changed every 2–3 days, and cultures were passaged when they reached ∼70–90% confluence. Antibodies—The following primary antibodies were used in this study: anti-T7 epitope antibody (mouse IgG2b; Novagen); anti-VE-cadherin antibody 45C6 (mouse IgG1; ICOS, Bothell, WA); anti-vinculin antibody VIN-11-5 (mouse IgG1; Sigma); anti-phosphotyrosine antibody G104 (mouse IgG1) (33Garton A.J. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Tonks N.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); anti-paxillin antibody (mouse IgG1; Transduction Laboratories); and the PTPμ-specific antibodies SK7 (mouse IgG1), BK2 (mouse IgG2a), and BK3 (mouse IgG1) (15Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated on glass coverslips, grown to the desired density, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 12.5 min. Cells were either permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline, 3% normal goat serum, and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min or left intact as indicated. Fixed samples were incubated either with single primary antibodies or, for co-staining, with two antibodies of different isotypes. The primary antibodies were detected with isotype-specific secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) to mouse IgG1 (labeled with Alexa 594) or to mouse IgG2b or IgG2a (labeled with Alexa 488). Co-staining with antibodies SK7 and 45C6, both of which are IgG1 isotype, was performed as follows. Fixed cells were first incubated with antibody SK7, followed by a 20-fold excess of Fab fragments of rabbit anti-mouse IgG and then Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. Then the cells were incubated with antibody 45C6, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG. A control sample in which antibody 45C6 was omitted did not show staining with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG, indicating that the excess, Fab fragment rabbit anti-mouse IgG, effectively blocked antibody SK7 from reaction with this secondary antibody. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using ProLong anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and examined by epifluorescence using an Axiophot 2 microscope and digital imaging system with a ×63 objective lens (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY) unless indicated otherwise. Images were processed using OpenLab software (Improvision Software, Lexington, MA). Confocal images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscopy system using a ×100 objective lens and processed with built-in software and ImageJ software (National Institute of Mental Health, available at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—GM7372 cells were grown to the desired density and solubilized in lysis buffer (30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 8% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatants were assayed for protein concentration with Bradford reagent using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting with anti-PTPμ monoclonal antibodies SK7 and BK2 as described (15Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, equal amounts of protein from GM7372 cell lysates, prepared as described above, were incubated with anti-T7 epitope antibody-conjugated agarose (Novagen) for2hat4°C. Samples were washed four times in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Assay of Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis—Proliferation rates of cell lines were assayed by measuring incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Cells were plated on glass coverslips at a density of 4 × 103 cells/cm2, and 36 h later, 20 μm BrdUrd was added for 40 min. Cells were stained for BrdUrd incorporation using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were co-stained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) to visualize nuclei of all cells and imaged by epifluorescence using a ×10 objective. Total and BrdUrd-positive cells were counted in images using ImageJ software, and the percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells was calculated. To assay for apoptosis, cells were plated on glass coverslips at 4 × 103 cells/cm2 and incubated at 37 °C for 36 h. Cells were fixed as described above for immunofluorescence and stained with Hoechst 33342 according to the supplier's protocol. Cells displaying condensed chromatin and the formation of nuclear blebs containing DNA were counted as apoptotic. The percentage of apoptotic cells in six representative fields of each sample was calculated as described above for the assay of BrdUrd incorporation. Generation of Stable Lines of GM7372 Cells Expressing PTPμ Deletion Constructs—As an initial step in understanding the mechanisms involved in regulating PTPμ function in endothelial cells, we expressed various mutant constructs in GM7372 cells, a cell line derived from BAEC. GM7372 cells have similar morphology and growth properties compared with primary BAEC and express endothelium-specific cell junction proteins (Fig. 1) (data not shown) (29Grinspan J.B. Mueller S.N. Levine E.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 114: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). GM7372 cells expressed a similar level of endogenous PTPμ compared with the parental BAEC (Fig. 1B). In agreement with previous findings (15Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 19Bianchi C. Sellke F.W. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), PTPμ was observed as a full-length ∼200 kDa protein (Fig. 1B, EP) and as processed proteolytic fragments of ∼110 kDa for the E-subunit (Fig. 1B, E) and P-subunit (data not shown). As described previously (19Bianchi C. Sellke F.W. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), at high cell density, PTPμ co-localized at cell-cell contacts with the endothelial-specific VE-cadherin, and the level of PTPμ protein was increased (Fig. 1, B and C). In subconfluent cells, PTPμ was found in a perinuclear vesicular compartment (Fig. 1C). Ectopic expression of PTPμWT, PTPμΔIg (deletion of amino acids 190–310), and PTPμΔE (deletion of amino acids 23–638) was achieved by infection of GM7372 monolayers with recombinant retrovirus encoding the T7 epitope-tagged PTPμ constructs. We utilized a vector, pWZL, containing an internal ribosomal entry site, from which PTPμ and the selection marker are separately translated from the same mRNA. Stable cells were selected in hygromycin as pooled populations from an ∼90% confluent monolayer of infected GM7372 cells. Attempts to isolate clonal cell lines of GM7372 expressing PTPμ from dilute cultures were unsuccessful. We reasoned that any inhibitory effects on growth or survival caused by ectopic expression of PTPμ might be more pronounced at low cell density, when the normal level of PTPμ is low, than at high cell density, when expression of the phosphatase is naturally up-regulated. The use of the pWZL vector resulted in a tight correlation between hygromycin resistance and ectopic expression of PTPμ, producing cell populations in which 70–80% of the cells expressed detectable amounts of the specific PTPμ mutant, as determined by detection with anti-PTPμ antibodies (data not shown). Immunoblotting of cell lysates with antibodies specific to the P-subunit (SK7) and the E-subunit (BK2) indicated similar levels of expression from each construct (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the wild-type EP protein migrated as a doublet on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, with the slower migrating band, previously shown to represent the glycosylated form (11Gebbink M.F. Zondag G.C. Koningstein G.M. Feiken E. Wubbolts R.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), predominating. In contrast, the hypoglycosylated form of PTPμΔIg predominated, which would contribute to the faster than expected migration of the E-subunit of this mutant on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. In addition, immunoprecipitation of the P-subunit of PTPμΔIg with the antibody to the C-terminal T7 epitope followed by immunoblotting of the E-subunit with antibody BK3 demonstrated that the two intact segments of the processed protein were associated in the cell, as seen with the WT protein (Fig. 2). The Ig Domain Is the Major Determinant of Localization of PTPμ to Sites of Cell-Cell Contact—It has been proposed that homophilic binding may be responsible for localization of PTPμ to cell-cell contacts (10Brady-Kalnay S.M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28472-28477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gebbink M.F. Zondag G.C. Koningstein G.M. Feiken E. Wubbolts R.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To test this idea in a cellular context, GM7372 cells expressing T7 epitope-tagged PTPμ mutants were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence with the anti-T7 epitope antibody to determine the subcellular localization of the phosphatase. Full-length PTPμ-WTT7 localized to cell-cell contacts as indicated by co-localization with VE-cadherin (Fig. 3, WT panels). Deletion of the Ig domain, containing the homophilic binding site, greatly reduced the localization of PTPμ to cell-cell contacts (Fig. 3, ΔIg panels), resulting in a dispersed pattern consistent with expression at the cell surface. Therefore, the Ig domain, which contains the homophilic binding site (10Brady-Kalnay S.M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28472-28477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is a major determinant for localization to cell-cell contacts, suggesting that homophilic binding is important for this localization. Deletion of the entire E-subunit, containing most of the extracellular domain, completely eliminated localization of PTPμ to cell-cell contacts (Fig. 3, ΔE panels), suggesting that this region may contain sequences in addition to the Ig domain that play a part in this localization. A role has been proposed for the MAM domain in homophilic binding (11Gebbink M.F. Zondag G.C. Koningstein G.M. Feiken E. Wubbolts R.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); however, we were unable to determine whether the MAM domain may contribute to the localization of PTPμ because constructs with a deletion of this domain could not be stably expressed at levels comparable with the other mutants (data not shown). This is consistent with studies of the metalloprotease meprin A, which have suggested that the MAM domain may be critical for protein stability (34Tsukuba T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35260-35267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To verify that the localization of PTPμΔIg in GM7372 cells is a property of the phosphatase and not a phenomenon unique to these cells, we examined the localization the PTPμ deletion constructs in two additional cell types, a transformed endothelial cell line trBAEC and MDCK epithelial cells, the latter being a well established model for studying cell-cell adhesion. In trBAEC and MDCK cells, as seen in GM7372 cells, deletion of the Ig domain resulted in reduced localization to cell-cell contacts and a more dispersed distribution over the cell compared with the WT protein (Fig. 4). These results confirm that the Ig domain is a major determinant for the localization of PTPμ to cell-cell contacts in multiple cell types. The PTPμΔIg Protein Is Present at the Cell Surface—As described above, deletion of the Ig domain led to a widespread distribution of PTPμ over what appeared to be the cell surface. To confirm that the PTPμΔIg protein was present at the cell surface, we used the extracellular domain-specific antibody BK2 to stain GM7372 cells that had not been permeabilized prior to antibody staining. PTPμWT was detected primarily at cell-cell contacts in intact non-permeabilized cells, whereas PTPμΔIg was dispersed over the surface of the cell (Fig. 5). Staining of permeabilized cells revealed additional localization of both PTPμWT and PTPμΔIg in a perinuclear region (Fig. 5) as described for the endogenous protein (Fig. 1). We were unable to determine whether PTPμΔE can reach the cell surface, as it did not react with the available antibodies directed against the extracellular region of PTPμ. To analyze the localization of the mutant PTPμ proteins in further detail, we examined MDCK cells, which, in contrast to GM7372 endothelial cells, form a monolayer in culture with sufficient depth to visualize cell morphology in three dimensions using confocal microscopy. Cross-section imaging of MDCK cells expressing full-length PTPμWT and PTPμWTΔD2, a mutant lacking the membrane distal catalytic domain, stained with an antibody directed against the P-subunit of PTPμ, indicated that these proteins, which contain an intact E-subunit, were found concentrated along most of the lateral cell-cell contacts (Fig. 6). Co-staining with antibodies to the tight junction protein ZO-1, a marker for the apical junction, showed that PTPμWT was absent from the apical terminal portion of the lateral surface (data not shown). In contrast, the PTPμΔIg protein was seen in the lateral junction and on the apical and basal surfaces"
https://openalex.org/W2062099953,"After therapeutic hormone deprivation, most prostate cancer (PrCa) cells develop androgen-independent (AI) growth. PrCa is highly heterogeneous and multifocal, suggesting that several molecular processes or pathways may be contributing to AI. The human LuCaP 23.1 xenograft model retains clinical hallmarks of PrCa, including heterogeneous growth, PSA production, androgen-responsiveness and progression to AI. In this work, we studied the effect of androgen depletion (castration) on the growth of LuCaP 23.1 xenografts. A total of 100 nude mice were implanted and analysed for their growth profiles before and after castration. By 11 and 15 weeks, tumours were harvested and assessed for molecular marker expression specific for PrCa. Prior to castration we found 37 fast growing (FG) tumours (948.9+/-76.9 mm(3)) and 63 slow growing (SG) tumours (229.6+/-18.4 mm(3)), a previously undescribed result for this PrCa model. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that in comparison to SGs, FGs contained high HER1, uPA and thymidilate synthetase (TS) expression with low levels of 5alpha-reductase 2 mRNA. All FG tumours progressed rapidly to AI growth 5 weeks after castration (FG-P). In SG castrated tumours, 66% of tumours (SG-P) showed retarded progression (by 12 weeks) to AI, whereas 34% responded to castration (SG-R). Molecular analysis permitted us to define distinct molecular profiles integrating different pathways associated with AI progression. FG-P, and a subgroup of SG-P tumours, presented significantly high levels of peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), HER1, HER2, TS, and uPA mRNA, all of which correlated with AR expression. The second subgroup of SG-P tumours showed overexpression of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2. A third subgroup of SG-P tumours showed significant expression of hypoxia-related gene (adrenomedullin) after castration. This work permitted to define distinct molecular profiles related to different AI growth in the LuCaP 23.1 xenograft."
https://openalex.org/W1992076740,"The enzymatic activity of the vitamin K-dependent proteins requires the post-translational conversion of specific glutamic acids to γ-carboxy-glutamic acid by the integral membrane enzyme, γ-glutamyl carboxylase. Whether or not cysteine residues are important for carboxylase activity has been the subject of a number of studies. In the present study we used carboxylase with point mutations at cysteines, chemical modification, and mass spectrometry to examine this question. Mutation of any of the free cysteine residues to alanine or serine had little effect on carboxylase activity, although C343A mutant carboxylase had only 38% activity compared with that of wild type. In contrast, treatment with either thiol-reactive reagent 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, disodium salt, or sodium tetrathionate, caused complete loss of activity. We identified the residues modified, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, as Cys323 and Cys343. According to our results, these residues are on the cytoplasmic side of the microsomal membrane, whereas catalytic residues are expected to be on the lumenal side of the membrane. Carboxylase was partially protected from chemical modification by factor IXs propeptide. Although all mutant carboxylases bound propeptide with normal affinity, chemical modification caused a >100-fold decrease in carboxylase affinity for the consensus propeptide. We conclude that cysteine residues are not directly involved in carboxylase catalysis, but chemical modification of Cys323 and Cys343 may disrupt the three-dimensional structure, resulting in inactivation.

Vitamin K-dependent carboxylation is required for the biological activity of vitamin K-dependent proteins. Carboxylation is a post-translational conversion of glutamyl residues in the precursor proteins to γ-carboxyglutamic acid (gla) 1The abbreviations used are: gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; VKH2, vitamin K hydroquinone; DTT, dithiothreitol; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, disodium salt; DABMI, 4-dimethylaminophenylazophenyl-4′-maleimide; CHAPS, (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; FLEEL, the peptide Phe-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu; proFIX, 19 amino acid residues of factor IX propeptide (–18 to 1); proFIXgla, propeptide with the gla domain of factor IX (–18 to 46 with the mutations of R-4Q and R-1S); proCon, consensus propeptide (AVFLSREQANQVLQRRRR); MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight; MS, mass spectrometry. residues in the mature protein (1Vermeer C.

These gla residues allow the vitamin K-dependent proteins to bind calcium necessary for their biological functions in blood coagulation, bone homeostasis, and other areas. Vitamin K-dependent carboxylation is catalyzed by an integral membrane glycoprotein, γ-glutamyl carboxylase. During the process of carboxylation, the γ-hydrogen of the glutamic acid is abstracted, followed by the addition of CO2 (1Vermeer C. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, carboxylase converts vitamin K hydroquinone (VKH2) to vitamin K 2,3-epoxide (vitamin K epoxidation) (3Morris D.P.

Biophys. 1982; 214: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Numerous publications have suggested that free cysteine residues are important for vitamin K-dependent carboxylation and epoxidation. For example, the addition of DTT to carboxylase-containing microsomes stimulates carboxylation of glutamyl residues (5Friedman P.A. Shia M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Moreover, modification of carboxylase by sulfhydryl-reactive reagents inactivates the enzyme (3Morris D.P. Soute B.A. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported that a thiol group is essential for the binding of VKH2 to the active site of carboxylase. Bouchard et al. (10Bouchard B.A. Furie B. Furie B.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9517-9523Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) showed that NEM, a sulfhydryl-reactive reagent, reacts with two to three free cysteines in bovine carboxylase, resulting in the inactivation of the enzyme. Further support for this hypothesis was provided by Pudota et al. (11Pudota B.N. Miyagi M. Hallgren K.W. West K.A. Crabb J.W. Misono K.S. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13033-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), who used electrospray mass spectrometry to identify the cysteine residues modified by NEM. They concluded that Cys99 and Cys450 are the two active site cysteines required for both vitamin K-dependent carboxylation and epoxidation. Based on the observations that carboxylase is inactivated by sulfhydryl-reactive reagents, Dowd et al. (12Dowd P. Hershline R. Ham S.W. Naganathan S. Science. 1995; 269: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) used a nonenzymatic chemical model to develop a “base strength amplification mechanism” for vitamin K-dependent carboxylation. Those investigators proposed that two free cysteines are involved in the active site of the carboxylase. We recently found that Cys99 and Cys450 are actually joined in a disulfide bond (13Tie J.K.

In addition, we found that mutation of each of the other eight cysteine residues in carboxylase did not inactivate the enzyme, although C288S had only 56% activity relative to that of wild type. Although we confirmed that NEM modification of carboxylase causes inactivation, mutation of the modified residues Cys139, Cys311, Cys323, and Cys343 did not inactivate the carboxylase (13Tie J.K.

These results raise the question of whether sulfhydryl groups are really important for catalysis, and if so by what mechanism? In our first study we changed cysteine to serine in most cases, so here we made cysteine to alanine changes. In addition to mutations, we employed thiol-reactive reagents with different charge/polarity characteristics to identify which cysteine residues in the carboxylase affect the enzyme activity by chemical modification. We used MALDI-TOF MS to identify the chemically modified cysteine residues. Our results suggest that modification of cysteines probably causes structural or steric effects on carboxylase rather than modifying residues directly involved in the carboxylation reaction. While this paper was under review, Rishavy et al. (14Rishavy M.A. Pudota B.N. Hallgren K.W. Qian W. Yakubenko A.V. Song J.H. Runge K.W. Berkner K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reached a similar conclusion: that cysteine is not an active site residue of vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. Materials—All of the chemicals were reagent grade. AMS and DABMI were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). NEM, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, α-cyano-4-hydroxysuccinnamic acid, Na2S4O6, NaBH4, and CHAPS were obtained from Sigma. Pentapeptide FLEEL and protease inhibitors, H-d-Phe-Phe-Arg-chloromethylketone and H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethylketone were from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). The propeptide of proFIX and proCon and the fluorescein-labeled proFIX and proCon were chemically synthesized and purified by Chiron Mimotopes (Clayton, Australia). proFIXgla was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (15Wu S.M. Soute B.A. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13124-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vitamin K1 (10 mg/ml, which contains 70 mg/ml polyxyethylated fatty acid derivative, 37.5 mg/ml dextrose hydrous, and 9 mg/ml benzyl alcohol) was from Abbott Laboratories (Chicago, IL). Aprotinin, pepstatin A, trypsin, and proteinase K were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Polyvinylidene fluoride transfer membrane was from Millipore Co. (Bedford, MA). NaH14CO3 (specific activity, 54 mCi/mmol) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Restriction enzymes and peptide N-glycosidase F were from New England Biolab (Beverly, MA). Anti-HPC4 resin was kindly provided by Dr. Charles Esmon (Cardiovascular Biology Research Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK). Reduction of Vitamin K1 to VKH2—Three volumes of buffer K (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) containing 200 mm DTT were added to one volume of vitamin K1 solution (10 mg/ml) and incubated in the dark at 37 °C for at least 24 h to ensure complete reduction. The concentration of this reduced VKH2 stock solution was 5.55 mm. For experiments where DTT was avoided, vitamin K1 was freshly reduced by NaBH4 as follows: vitamin K1 was diluted with an equal volume of buffer K, and NaBH4 was added to the solution to obtain a final concentration of 0.1 m. The reduction reaction was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 20 min. Excess NaBH4 was removed by adjusting the reaction to pH 4.0 with 1 m HCl and incubating at room temperature for 5 min. Then the pH of the solution was adjusted to pH 8.5 with 1 m Tris, and buffer K was added to adjust the concentration of VKH2 to 5.55 mm. Carboxylase Activity Assays—The carboxylase activity was determined by the incorporation of 14CO2 into the pentapeptide substrate FLEEL. The assay was performed in 25 mm MOPS (pH 6.8), 500 mm NaCl, 0.8 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.12% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 0.28% CHAPS (buffer A), with 4 μm proFIX, and 1.25 mm FLEEL. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of an ice-cold mix of NaH14CO3 (final concentration, 40 μCi/ml) and VKH2 (final concentration, 222 μm) to bring the volume to 125 μl. The reaction mix was immediately transferred to a 20 °C water bath and incubated for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the amount of 14CO2 incorporation was determined as previously described (16Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16940-16944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Sulfhydryl-reactive Reagent Modification of Carboxylase—Purified carboxylase (50 nm) (16Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16940-16944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was modified by the sulfhydryl-reactive reagents in buffer A. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the sulfhydryl-reactive reagent, and samples were incubated on ice for 20 min in the dark. The reaction was stopped by the addition of DTT to a final concentration of 50 mm. Carboxylase activity was determined by the incorporation of 14CO2 into the pentapeptide substrate FLEEL (16Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16940-16944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Na2S4O6 modification is reversed by DTT. Therefore, when we used Na2S4O6 as the thiol-reactive reagent, we stopped the reaction by diluting the sample 10-fold with buffer A. The enzyme activity was determined immediately as described above except we used NaBH4-reduced VKH2. For sequential modification of carboxylase by Na2S4O6 and AMS, carboxylase was first incubated with Na2S4O6 (5 mm, on ice for 10 min). A portion of the sample was incubated with 1 mm AMS for another 10 min. When we wanted to reverse the Na2S4O6 modification, we stopped the reaction by the addition of DTT (final concentration, 50 mm); otherwise we stopped the reaction with dilution as described above. The residual carboxylase activity was measured as above. Limited Trypsinization of Carboxylase—Limited trypsin digestion of carboxylase was performed as previously described (17Wu S.M. Mutucumarana V.P. Geromanos S. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11718-11722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A pilot reaction was run for each batch of trypsin and carboxylase to determine the optimal conditions for limited cleavage. Cleavage was accomplished on ice in the presence of 5 μm proFIX. We omitted proFIX in the trypsin digestion samples used for propeptide binding and protection experiments. Trypsin cleavage was stopped by the addition of H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethylketone and aprotinin to a final concentration of 1.6 μm. We analyzed the extent of trypsin cleavage of carboxylase on gradient (4–20%, reducing conditions) SDS-PAGE gels followed by silver staining. This limited trypsin-digested carboxylase is still enzymatically active. Protection of Carboxylase from Inactivation by Na2S4O6—We investigated whether the following molecules would protect carboxylase from inactivation by Na2S4O6: 10 mm FLEEL, 8 μm proFIX, 8 μm proFIXgla, 222 μm VKH2, and various combinations of these reagents. Carboxylase (50 nm) was incubated with the reagent(s) on ice for 5 min in buffer A. The samples were divided in equal volumes, and Na2S4O6 (500 μm) was added to one half, and solvent/buffer was added to the other. The mixtures were incubated on ice for 20 min, and then carboxylase activity was determined using NaBH4-reduced VKH2. We measured the time course of inactivation of carboxylase and trypsin-digested carboxylase (50 nm) in the presence (8 μm proFIX) or absence of propeptide. We incubated the enzyme with or without propeptide on ice for 5 min. Na2S4O6 was added, portions were removed, and the reaction was stopped at various times. The residual activity was determined as described above. Fluorescence Titration of Intact and Trypsin-digested Carboxylase— Fluorescence anisotropy titration of intact and trypsin-digested carboxylase with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-labeled proFIX were performed on an OLIS-modified T-format SLM spectrofluorimeter (On-Line Instruments, Bogart, GA) essentially as described previously (18Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was set as 495 nm, and the slits were set as 4-nm band pass. Two photon counters were used to detect the emissions at horizontal and vertical directions to increase the sensitivity. All of the measurements were performed in a 400-μl fluorimetric quartz cuvette at 4.5 °C in a final sample volume of 300 μl of buffer containing 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 180 mm NaCl, 3.5% glycerol, 0.1% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 0.28% CHAPS, 0.4% bovine serum albumin (standard buffer), and 10 nm 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-labeled proFIX. After measuring fluorescence anisotropy, we converted the values to the fraction of enzyme bound. The Kd values of proFIX for carboxylase were estimated as described previously (18Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For titration of Na2S4O6-inactivated intact and trypsin-digested carboxylase, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-labeled proCon was used as ligand. Identification of AMS-labeled Cysteine Residue of Carboxylase—Carboxylase or Na2S4O6-inactivated carboxylase were incubated with 1 mm AMS on ice for 20 min. The reactions were stopped by DTT. AMS-labeled and nonlabeled carboxylase samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were fixed by soaking the gel in 25% isopropanol with 10% acetic acid for 30 min, stained with 0.01% Coomassie R-250 in 10% acetic acid for 1 h, and destained by 10% acetic acid. The carboxylase bands were excised, and in-gel deglycosylation and trypsin digestion were performed as described previously (13Tie J.K. Mutucumarana V.P. Straight D.L. Carrick K.L. Pope R.M.

The digested sample (0.3 μl) and 0.3 μl of 10 mg/ml 1-cyano-4-hydroxysuccinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) were deposited on the target plate and air-dried. MALDI mass spectra were recorded with an ABI 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer as described (13Tie J.K. Mutucumarana V.P. Straight D.L. Carrick K.L. Pope R.M. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45468-45475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF data from tryptic digests were calibrated with autoproteolytic peaks (internal standards), and mass errors were less than 20 ppm. TOF MS/MS scan functions were calibrated externally against the fragments of either angiotensin I or adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18–39 depending upon the precursor mass. The mass accuracy of collision-induced dissociation data was typically better than 50 ppm. Identification of the Last Transmembrane Domain of Carboxylase— Freshly prepared carboxylase-containing microsomes from High Five cells were digested by protease K as described previously (20Tie J. Wu S.M. Jin D. Nicchitta C.V. Stafford D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration, 3 mm). The protease should degrade all of the peptide loops of carboxylase on the outside of the microsomal membrane, leaving the sequences inside the membranes intact. The microsomes were washed 3 times with the digestion buffer containing 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. According to our previously published membrane topology (20Tie J. Wu S.M. Jin D. Nicchitta C.V. Stafford D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the C-terminal fragment with the last transmembrane domain of carboxylase should contain the HPC4 antibody recognition sequence, so we purified this fragment by affinity chromatography using the antibody column described before (20Tie J. Wu S.M. Jin D. Nicchitta C.V. Stafford D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 973-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fraction bound to and eluted from the affinity chromatography column was concentrated by 10% trichloroacetic acid precipitation and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and the C-terminal fragment was identified by Western blot using the HPC4 antibody. The N-terminal sequence of the peptide was determined at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Carboxylase and Expression and Purification of Carboxylase in Insect Cells—Oligonucleotides and PCR primers used for mutagenesis were synthesized by Invitrogen. Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteines of human γ-glutamyl carboxylase was conducted by the “Megaprimer” method of PCR mutagenesis (21Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar, 22Datta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4530-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Wild type carboxylase cDNA with a HPC4 tag at the C terminus (23Stearns D.J. Kurosawa S. Sims P.J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 826-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as template DNA for PCR. The mutations were screened by restriction digestion and verified by sequencing the entire cDNA. The wild type and cysteine mutants of carboxylase were expressed in High Five cells and purified as described previously (16Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16940-16944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). DTT was excluded from all of the purification steps, and the protease inhibition mixture was omitted from the sample destined for trypsin digestion. The active enzyme concentration was determined by fluorescence anisotropy titration of the enzyme against fluorescein-labeled consensus propeptide as described (18Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Carboxylase by Thiol-reactive Reagents—Because vitamin K-dependent carboxylase is inactivated by a variety of thiol-reactive reagents, free cysteines have been implicated as comprising part of the carboxylase active site (3Morris D.P. Soute B.A. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8735-8742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Canfield L.M. Sinsky T.A. Suttie J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 202: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 9Canfield L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 10Bouchard B.A. Furie B. Furie B.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9517-9523Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the inactivation curve of carboxylase by increasing concentrations of different thiol-reactive reagents at a fixed reaction time of 20 min at 0 °C. Na2S4O6 and AMS (a hydrophilic maleimide derivative) inactivate carboxylase. In contrast, the hydrophobic maleimide derivative DABMI, which has a structure similar to AMS, does not inactivate carboxylase at concentrations up to 5 mm. These results suggest that cysteine residues that affect the enzyme activity by chemical modification may be located in the hydrophilic but not the hydrophobic regions of the carboxylase. Hydrophilic Maleimide and Na2S4O6 Modify the Same Cysteine Residues of Carboxylase—We next examined whether Na2S4O6 and AMS inhibit carboxylase activity by reacting with the same cysteine residue(s). To accomplish this, carboxylase was first treated with Na2S4O6, whose modification can be reversed by DTT. This tetrathionated enzyme was then treated with AMS. More than 90% of the carboxylase activity of Na2S4O6-inactivated carboxylase was recovered after DTT treatment (Fig. 2). AMS-modified carboxylase is irreversibly inactivated. However, carboxylase first modified by Na2S4O6 and then treated with AMS regains about 80% of its activity following DTT treatment. These results suggest that AMS and Na2S4O6 modify the same cysteine residue(s) of the carboxylase. Protection of Na2S4O6 Inactivation of Carboxylase—If cysteine residues are part of the active site, then one might expect substrates to protect the enzyme from inactivation by thiol-reactive reagents. In addition to the glutamate substrate, γ-carboxylation requires VKH2, carbon dioxide, and oxygen as co-substrates. Moreover, the propeptide of the Glu-containing substrate stimulates carboxylation (24Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results (Table I) show that proFIX, proFIXgla, VKH2, pentapeptide substrate (FLEEL), and different combinations of these substrates protect the carboxylase from inactivation by Na2S4O6 to various extents.Table IProtection of carboxylase from inactivation by Na2S4O6SubstrateActivity (means ± S.D., n = 3)%Blank43 ± 1proFIX80 ± 1proFIX/FLEEL81 ± 2proFIX/VKH289 ± 1proFIX/VKH2/FLEEL86 ± 1proFIXgla91 ± 1proFIXgla / VKH293 ± 2FLEEL42 ± 1VKH266 ± 1VKH2/FLEEL72 ± 1 Open table in a new tab It is noteworthy that proFIX and proFIXgla both significantly protect carboxylase from inactivation by Na2S4O6, but carboxylase that has been nicked at residues 349 and 351 by limited trypsin digestion is less well protected, although still active. After 1 h of incubation with Na2S4O6, intact carboxylase retains about 30% activity in the absence of proFIX, whereas in the presence of proFIX about 80% activity remains (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the “nicked” carboxylase is not protected by the propeptide (Fig. 3B). Propeptide Binding Capacity of Intact and Nicked Carboxylase—One possible reason the nicked enzyme was not protected from Na2S4O6 inactivation may be because it does not bind propeptide. To test this we compared the propeptide binding of the nicked enzyme to that of intact carboxylase using fluoroscein-labeled proFIX. Our results show (Fig. 4A) that the nicked carboxylase has binding characteristics similar to those of the intact carboxylase. The Kd values for proFIX/intact carboxylase and proFIX/nicked carboxylase are 16.3 ± 0.4 and 37.3 ± 1nm, respectively. Because we used a high concentration of propeptide in the protection experiments (8 μm), the enzyme should be saturated with substrate, and the loss of protection of propeptide against Na2S4O6 inactivation of nicked carboxylase is not due to a lack of propeptide binding to the nicked enzyme. These results suggest that Na2S4O6-modified cysteine residues are not located in the propeptide-binding site. We further examined the propeptide binding capacities of Na2S4O6-inactivated carboxylase using the fluoroscein-labeled proCon. As shown in Fig. 4B, modification by Na2S4O6 significantly decreases the affinity of carboxylase for the consensus propeptide (Kd = 35 versus 0.3 nm for unmodified). We observed a similar, although less dramatic, effect on the trypsin-nicked modified enzyme (Fig. 4B). Identification of AMS-modified Cysteine Residues of Carboxylase by MALDI-TOF MS—We employed MALDI-TOF MS to identify cysteine residues modified by the hydrophilic thiol-reactive reagent, AMS. The spectra for trypsin-digested modified and nonmodified samples are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Compared with the nonmodified sample (Fig. 5, A, C, and E, and Fig. 6, A and C), we identified five major new peptide peaks (m/z at 1603.63, 2409.13, 2537.22, 1915.77, and 2849.37) in the spectra of the AMS-modified sample (Fig. 5, B, D, and F, and Fig. 6, B and D). The new peptide peaks at m/z 1603.63, 2409.13, and 2537.22 (Fig. 5, B, D, and F) represent AMS modification of Cys323 containing tryptic peptides, KLVSYCPQR (m/z at 1093.58), LVSYCPQRLQQLLPLK (m/z at 1899.09), and KLVSYCPQRLQQLLPLK (m/z at 2027.18), respectively. The peptide peaks at m/z 1915.77 and 2849.37 (Fig. 6, B and D) derive from AMS modification of Cys343-containing tryptic peptides AAPQPSVSCVYKR (m/z at 1405.73) and LQQLLPLKAAPQPSVSCVYKR(m/z at 2339.33), respectively. The skipped trypsin cleavage sites are identified in bold type. All 10 cysteines of the carboxylase were identified, and Cys323 and Cys343 are the only two cysteines modified by AMS under our reaction conditions. The mass increase from AMS modifica"

Here we report the characterization of a cardiac-specific enhancer located within -2.354/-1.36 kbp of the gene, which is active in cardiocytes but not in C2 skeletal muscle cells. In vivo it directs reporter gene expression to the adult heart, where the proximal promoter alone is inactive. An 85-bp region within the enhancer is highly conserved between human and mouse and contains a central AT-rich site, which is essential for enhancer activity. This site binds myocyte enhancer factor (MEF)2 factors, principally MEF2D and MEF2A in cardiocyte nuclear extracts. These results are discussed in the context of MEF2 activity and of the regulation of the α-cardiac actin locus. Expression of the mouse α-cardiac actin gene in skeletal and cardiac muscle is regulated by enhancers lying 5′ to the proximal promoter.

These results are discussed in the context of MEF2 activity and of the regulation of the α-cardiac actin locus. α-Cardiac actin is a member of a highly conserved multigene family, found in all eukaryotic cells, of which the isoforms are differentially expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner (1Vandekerckhove J. Weber K. Differentiation. 1979; 14: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In mouse, α-cardiac actin is expressed in the early myocardium and in somites from embryonic day 8.5. as the skeletal muscle of the myotome begins to form (2Sassoon D. Garner I. Buckingham M. Development (Camb.). 1988; 104: 155-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After birth, the α-cardiac actin gene remains expressed at a high level in the heart and is down-regulated in skeletal muscles at the same time as α-skeletal actin remains expressed in skeletal muscle and is down-regulated in the heart (3Gunning P. Ponte P. Blau H.M. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Buckingham M.E. Essays Biochem. 1985; 20: 77-109PubMed Google Scholar, 5Garner I. Sassoon D. Vandekerkhove J. Alonso S. Buckingham M.E. Dev. Biol. 1989; 134: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Several lines of genetic evidence suggest that α-cardiac actin is essential for normal structure and function of adult cardiac myocytes. In BALB/c mice, a 5′-partial duplication of the α-cardiac actin gene is associated with the down-regulation of the α-cardiac actin mRNA and protein (6Garner I. Minty A.J. Alonso S. Barton P.J. Buckingham M.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), leading to enhanced expression of α-skeletal actin mRNA and protein after birth through a compensatory mechanism (5Garner I. Sassoon D. Vandekerkhove J. Alonso S. Buckingham M.E. Dev. Biol. 1989; 134: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the hearts of adult BALB/c mice present functional alterations with increased contractility (7Hewett T.E. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). When a null mutation is introduced into the α-cardiac actin gene, the mice either do not survive to term or die within 2 weeks of birth because of extensive loss of thin filaments and sarcomere disorganization leading to heart failure (8Kumar A. Crawford K. Close L. Madison M. Lorenz J. Doetchman T. Pawlowski S. Duffy J. Neumann J. Robbins J. Boivin G.P. O'Toole B.A. Lessard J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4406-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Attempts to rescue the deficient cardiocytes by transgenic expression of a non-cardiac actin in such mutant mice causes heart enlargement and dysfunction (8Kumar A. Crawford K. Close L. Madison M. Lorenz J. Doetchman T. Pawlowski S. Duffy J. Neumann J. Robbins J. Boivin G.P. O'Toole B.A. Lessard J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In humans, missense mutations of the α-cardiac actin gene predispose affected cardiocytes to mechanical injury leading to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (9Olson T.M. Michels V.V. Thibodeau S.N. Tai Y.S. Keating M.T. Science. 1998; 280: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and eventual cell death. Taken together, these results indicate that both the type of actin expressed in the adult heart and the levels at which it is expressed are important for correct contractile function. Several regulatory sequences involved in the expression of the α-cardiac actin gene during muscle cell differentiation in vitro and the development of mammalian striated muscles in vivo have been identified. Transcriptional activation in differentiating skeletal muscle cells depends on critical sites in the proximal promoter of the human and mouse genes, notably a CArG-box binding serum response factor (10Sartorelli V. Webster K.A. Kedes L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 11Tuil D. Clergue N. Montarras D. Pinset C. Kahn A. Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. J. Mol.

Biol. 1991; 11: 4796-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Sartorelli V. Hong N.A. Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1994; 163: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been shown that the multiple CArG-boxes found in the α-cardiac actin promoters of several species (16Minty A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 17Mohun T.J. Garrett N. Gurdon J.B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3185-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) are sites of serum response factor and Nkx-2.5 interaction (18Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) acting to promote high levels of activity (19Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6372-6384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, previous observations on the BALB/c mouse line suggested that there might be other levels of regulation operating on this gene (6Garner I. Minty A.J. Alonso S. Barton P.J. Buckingham M.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSp 1The abbreviations used are: HSp, proximal DNase1 hypersensitive site; HSd, distal DNase1 hypersensitive site; MEF, myocyte enhancer factor; POX, proximal promoter of the α-cardiac actin gene; TkCAT, thymidine kinase promoter driving the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene; TkLacZ, thymidine kinase promoter driving the β-galactosidase gene; RSVLuc, Rous sarcoma virus long repeat driving the luciferase gene; MCK muscle creatine kinase; contig, group of overlapping clones; EnC, new enhancer region; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; n, nuclear localization sequence.1The abbreviations used are: HSp, proximal DNase1 hypersensitive site; HSd, distal DNase1 hypersensitive site; MEF, myocyte enhancer factor; POX, proximal promoter of the α-cardiac actin gene; TkCAT, thymidine kinase promoter driving the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene; TkLacZ, thymidine kinase promoter driving the β-galactosidase gene; RSVLuc, Rous sarcoma virus long repeat driving the luciferase gene; MCK muscle creatine kinase; contig, group of overlapping clones; EnC, new enhancer region; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; n, nuclear localization sequence. and HSd) were identified upstream of the mouse α-cardiac actin gene in the C2 skeletal muscle cell line. When these sequences where tested for activity in different cell lines with homologous and heterologous promoters they were shown to act as striated muscle-specific enhancers (20Biben C. Kirschbaum B. Garner I. Buckingham M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3504-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Analysis of the more distal sequence, at ∼-7 kbp from the gene, showed that its activity depends on an E-box, a target of myogenic regulatory factors, and also on an AT-rich 3′ sequence, which binds the homeodomain protein Emb in interaction with MEF2D and p300 (21Molinari S. Relaix F. Lemonnier M. Kirschbaum B. Schafer B. Buckingham M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2944-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This complex potentially plays a role in opening chromatin at the α-cardiac actin locus, rendering the E-box and downstream regulatory regions accessible; in transgenic mice when this sequence is present robust expression is seen (22Biben C. Hadchouel J. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter itself is a weak regulatory element directing expression to embryonic skeletal muscle and to the embryonic heart in a few transgenic lines. The distal sequence HSd acts as a skeletal muscle enhancer in vivo. Expression in the adult heart is seen with transgenes containing ∼-5 kbp of α-cardiac actin DNA, which includes the proximal DNase I hypersensitive site, consistent with a role for this proximal enhancer region in the transcription of the gene in cardiac muscle. In this study, we have examined in more detail this aspect of α-cardiac actin expression. We report on a third enhancer located within -2.354 kbp of the gene that directs transgene expression in the adult heart but not in skeletal muscle. In the embryo, it directs expression in the skeletal muscle of the somites, as well as the heart. However, unlike the previously described distal and proximal enhancers, it is not active in the C2 skeletal muscle cell line derived from postnatal muscle but only in cardiocytes. Its activity depends on a MEF2 site. Reporter Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—A 2.473-kbp BamHI fragment derived from the clone λIG 10 of the murine α-cardiac actin gene (6Garner I. Minty A.J. Alonso S. Barton P.J. Buckingham M.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) containing the -2.354, +0.119-kbp region of the gene was inserted into the BamHI site of the promoterless plasmid, pBLCAT6 (23Boshart M. Klüppel M. Schmidt A. Schütz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) generating the construct EnC proximal promoter region (POX). Deletions in this sequence were generated either by using convenient restriction sites in the 5′ region or by using partial digestion. Fragments were also cloned into a CAT construct (20Biben C. Kirschbaum B. Garner I. Buckingham M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3504-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in which the POX (-0.667, + 0.119 kbp) of the α-cardiac actin gene had been cloned into the promoterless plasmid pBLCAT6. Mutations of the MEF2 site were introduced separately, by site directed mutagenesis (transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit or QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis, Stratagene), in the -2.3- to -1.4-kbp region cloned in BlueScript. The two mutations substituted for the native MEF2 site were, respectively, TTTTCTACCCGGGACTGGT (m1) and TTTTCGATTCTTAACTGGT (m2). L. Bold characters indicate mutated nucleotides. Mutated DNA fragments were subsequently sequenced and transferred into POX (-0.669 kbp) or TkCAT. Multimerized sequences of the native or mutated α-cardiac actin MEF2 box were cloned into TkLacZ at a SfiI site introduced previously (provided by F. Relaix), and confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, and Assays—The C2/7 line, a subclone of the C2 cell line derived from the skeletal muscle of adult C3H mice, was grown as reported previously (24Catala F. Wanner R. Barton P. Cohen A. Wright W. Buckingham M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4585-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For DNA transfection, the cells were cultured in 6-cm diameter dishes with 20% fetal calf serum and allowed to differentiate in 2% fetal calf serum. The embryonic mouse fibroblast cell line C3H10T1/2 was grown in 10% fetal calf serum (24Catala F. Wanner R. Barton P. Cohen A. Wright W. Buckingham M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4585-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ventricular cardiocytes were prepared from hearts of 18 embryonic day Wistar rat fetuses according to the protocol of (25Kelly R.G. Lemonnier M. Zaffran S. Munk A. Buckingham M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 5005-5013Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Hearts were trimmed of the atria and outflow tract, and the ventricular cells were dissociated under gentle shaking in 1× trypsin (T4674 Sigma) in ADS medium complemented with glucose. Trypsin was inhibited by adding decomplemented newborn calf serum (Invitrogen). Cells were recovered by centrifugation and kept at 37 °C in newborn calf serum. Fresh enzyme solution was added to the tissue until complete dissociation was reached. Cells were plated in 6-cm dishes in plating medium and grown in 5% CO2. Cardiocytes and myogenic cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate transfection technique (26Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). The embryonic fibroblast cell line, C3H10T1/2, was transfected with superfect (Qiagen) under the conditions described by the manufacturer. 9 μg of CAT reporter construct and 0.5 μg of a reporter gene containing the Rous sarcoma long terminal repeat linked to the luciferase gene (RSVluc) were added to each dish. Myotubes were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and collected after being maintained 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum as reported elsewhere (24Catala F. Wanner R. Barton P. Cohen A. Wright W. Buckingham M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4585-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cardiocytes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline for 60 h following transfection, collected in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. Co-transfection was carried out with 15.5 μg of total DNA consisting of 0.5 μg of RSVLuc, 10 μg of a TkLacZ construct regulated by a concatamerized MEF2 site (x4) from the mouse muscle creatine kinase (MCK) or α-cardiac actin genes and 5 μg of MEF2A, MEF2C, or MEF2D expression vectors (27Martin J.F. Miano J.M. Hustad C.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkns N.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As a control an empty expression vector was used. CAT activity was measured by the simple phase extraction procedure (28Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), and luciferase activity was measured as described previously (20Biben C. Kirschbaum B. Garner I. Buckingham M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3504-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured with a galactolight kit (Tropix). The resulting CAT activity of the different constructs was normalized to the corresponding luciferase activity. All transfections were carried out in duplicate, and three different DNA preparations of each construct were tested. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts from ventricles of adult rat hearts were prepared according to the procedure of Mar and Ordahl (29Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Hearts were trimmed of the atria and outflow tract, washed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized in a Tissue Mizer for 12 s at half-power in homogenization buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.8 m sucrose, 5% glycerol), with added protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, number 1697498). Liberation of nuclei was checked with trypan blue dye, and the homogenate was centrifuged on a pad of homogenization buffer at 25K for 60 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were transferred to a Dounce homogenizer in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol), with added protease inhibitor mixture. Following 6 strokes with an A pestle, NaCl was added to a 0.5 m final volume. The homogenate was left for 30 min on a slow rotating table and then spun for 60 min at 35,000 rpm. The supernatant was dialyzed against 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol, with added protease inhibitor mixture, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Gel mobility shift assays were performed with a 10-μl reaction volume containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), 1 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, and 10% Ficoll), 0.5 ng of labeled DNA probe, and 3-6 μg of protein in crude nuclear extracts (24Catala F. Wanner R. Barton P. Cohen A. Wright W. Buckingham M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4585-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and run on 5% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio 49/1). The nucleotide sequences of the sense strand of probe and competitor DNAs used in the binding assays were as follows, α-cardiac actin, 5′-CAGTTTTCTATTTTTAACTGGTGTG; α-cardiac actin m2, 5′-CAGTTTTCGATTCTTAACTGGTGTG; MEF2 MCK, 5′-GCTCGCTCTAAAAATAACCCTGTC. Where indicated, antibodies or competing oligonucleotides (20-100-fold molar excess) were added to the incubation 10 min before adding the probe. Polyclonal preimmune and anti-MEF2 antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies to the three MEF2 isoforms (MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D) (30Han T.H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) were used at a 1:20 final dilution. The mixture was directly loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-buffered EDTA, prerun for 1 h. Then the gels were fixed, dried in a vacuum desiccator, and exposed to x-ray film overnight. Generation of Transgenic Mice, Screening of the Transgenic Lines, and Histochemical Staining for β-Galactosidase—The 2.4-kbp BamHI fragment was inserted at the BamHI site of pAC1SDKnLacZ (n represents a nuclear localization sequence) (22Biben C. Hadchouel J. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The insert was extracted by cutting with SacII and XhoI, eluted, purified, resuspended, and injected as described previously (22Biben C. Hadchouel J. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A 0.5-cm tail biopsy was digested, and DNA was prepared as reported before (22Biben C. Hadchouel J. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the case of founder animals, ∼10 μg of DNA were digested with EcoRI, separated in an 0.8% agarose gel and transferred onto a Hybond N+ membrane, which was treated according to standard procedures (31Maniatis T. Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 52-55Google Scholar). Probes (recognizing the β-galactosidase sequence or 5′ regions of the α-cardiac actin gene) were labeled using Amersham Biosciences Megaprime RPN 1606 and purified on a Chromaspin 100 column. Filters were hybridized in 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.6, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Transgenic litters were detected by amplification of a 0.9-kbp fragment encompassing the 3′-terminal of the α-cardiac actin promoter and the 5′-end of the nLacZ gene using the primers α-cardiac actin, 5′-GCTGCTCCAACTGACCCCGTCCATCAGAGAG and nLacZ, 5′-CGCATCGTAACCGTGCATCTGCCAGTTTGAG. The reaction was carried out for 25 cycles (94° 30 s, 57° 1 min, 72° 45 s) followed by 1 cycle of 72° for 10 min in 30 μl o f 1× PCR buffer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP mix, 0.5 μm primer mix, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Embryos or organs were dissected, fixed (22Biben C. Hadchouel J. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and stained (32Sanes J.R. Rubenstein J.L.R. Nicolas J-F. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) for various lengths of time. Thee copy number was estimated by Southern blotting (22Biben C. Hadchouel J. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The transgenic line shown here had a copy number of 2-3. Comparison of Mouse with Human Genomic Sequences—A 150-kbp contig of human genomic sequence was extracted from the human genome data base using the promoter sequence of the human α-cardiac actin gene (16Minty A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Different alignments of parts of this sequences with the 2-kbp cognate sequence of the mouse gene were performed. Two methods were used with the DNA Strider TM 1.3f8 program. DNA matrix analysis was performed with variable windows and stringencies. DNA alignment was performed by the blocks method with variable mismatch and gap penalties. Identification of a Cardiac Muscle Enhancer—The 5′-flanking region of the mouse α-cardiac actin gene was re-examined for cardiac as well as skeletal muscle regulatory elements by transfection experiments in primary cultures of cardiac muscle cells (cardiocytes), as well as the C2 skeletal muscle cell line, previously used to identify muscle enhancers (20Biben C. Kirschbaum B. Garner I. Buckingham M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3504-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The POX of -770 bp is active in both cell types but is a weak regulatory element in vivo where it does not direct transgene expression to the adult heart. The activity of the CAT reporter gene driven by POX was taken as 1 to compare the effect of upstream sequences, cloned in front of the POX transgene (Fig. 1). The distal enhancer region (HSd), which is active in differentiated skeletal muscle myotubes, shows very low activity in cardiocytes. The proximal enhancer, HSp, is active in cardiocytes as well as in C2/7 myotubes. In this deletion analysis a new enhancer region (EnC), which is active only in cardiocytes, is now identified in the -2.354- to -0.669-kbp region immediately 5′ of the proximal promoter. We had previously shown that ∼-5.7 kbp of α-cardiac actin upstream sequence (construction T3, (22Biben C. Hadchouel J. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) contained the necessary regulatory elements to direct nlacZ transgene expression to the adult heart. We how tested whether -2.354 kbp was sufficient for this transcriptional activity in vivo. Of four founder mice, one had a rearranged transgene, as shown by Southern blotting, and one was infertile, the two others gave rise to transgenic lines, which expressed the nlacZ transgene in the adult heart. In one case β-galactosidase activity was patchy in both atria and the ventricles, with prior expression in the embryonic heart also (results not shown); this expression was lost in subsequent generations. In the other line, all aspects of transgene expression were stable over the four generations examined. Between embryos/mice within a single litter, the pattern was also maintained, with minor variations in the extent of labeling in the right ventricle. Strong expression was seen in the embryonic (Fig. 2, a and b) and adult (Fig. 2, c and d) heart. In the adult both atria show intense X-gal staining. Most of the left ventricular myocardium is labeled. Part of the right ventricle is positive, with negative areas of myocardium ventrally. This was also the case at birth and during postnatal development (3 weeks, 3 months, results not shown). This is similar to the expression profile of the T3 transgenic lines, where -5.746 kbp, which included the HSp and EnC enhancers, was driving the transgene. The results shown here demonstrate that the EnC with the POX promoter is sufficient for expression in the adult heart. Expression in somites, in the skeletal muscle of the myotome, is also seen with this transgene in the strongly expressing line (Fig. 2, a and b). This is probably because of the proximal promoter, which can direct expression in embryonic muscle but not in the adult heart (22Biben C. Hadchouel J. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). No expression was detected in postnatal (3 weeks) or adult skeletal muscles (results not shown). Sequence Conservation in the 5′-Flanking Region of the α-Cardiac Actin Gene—Comparison of DNA genomic sequences located 8.6 kbp 5′ to the CAP site of the mouse and human α-cardiac actin genes was carried out using the DNA matrix program (Fig. 3a). A genomic contig of 150 kbp was identified in which the human gene was located. The sequence comparison shows regions of homology at ∼-8 to -7 kbp and -5 to -4 kbp, where the HSd and HSp sites are located, respectively. It also identifies a conserved region lying within -2 kbp from the CAP site potentially corresponding to the new enhancer region (EnC), in addition to sequences in the POX, which have been shown previously to play a role in its activity (16Minty A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The mouse -2 kbp fragment does not display significant homology with unrelated fragments of the human contig, using the matrix program (results not shown). Similar results were obtained using a larger (15 kbp) fragment of human genomic DNA (results not shown). We then focused on the conserved region at about -1.4 kbp from the CAP site. This relative location is conserved between human and mouse, and the homology is maintained at high stringency. Using the blocks method of Martinez (51Martinez H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 4629-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), DNA alignment shows that the conserved sequence is located between -1.432 and -1.350 kbp from the CAP site, with 85% identity and two gaps, and with most mismatches located at the extremities of the region (Fig. 3b). The functional characteristics of the conserved 82-bp sequence were tested by transfection experiments in primary cardiocyte cultures, in myotubes of the skeletal muscle C2/7 cell line and in the C3H 10T1/2 embryonic fibroblast line (Fig. 4). Upstream sequences were introduced in front of the POX directing a CAT reporter sequence. The activity of POX in the different cell cultures was taken as 1. As reported in Fig. 1 the complete -2.354-kbp sequence upstream of the α-cardiac actin CAP site was active in cardiocytes only. A series of deletions demonstrate that activity in cardiocytes depends on sequences lying 5′ to the SpeI site at -1.35 kbp from the gene. The BamHI/SpeI fragment (-2.354 to -1.364 kbp) was cloned in front of the Tk promoter driving the CAT reporter and shown to be active in cardiocytes, with some activity also in C2/7 myotubes (Table I). Activity in cardiac muscle cells was retained in the reverse orientation, and we therefore concluded that the sequence acts as an enhancer. Full activity is retained with a subfragment, which extends from the SpeI site to the HincII site a further 500 bp upstream (Fig. 4). The highly conserved 85-bp region alone does not exert more than about 2-fold activity, with incremental rises in activity as sequences extending to the HincII site are included. Between the HincII and the XbaI site, there is an Ebox, and its mutation results in some loss of activity, but we have not identified any single site that is essential for activity in contrast to the MEF2 site, which is essential for activity in the context of the larger fragment (BamHI/SpeI fragment). There are potential sites for cardiac regulators, some of which had a minor effect on activity.Table IThe MEF2 site is required for enhancer activityCardiocytesC2/7 MyotubesFibroblastsTkCAT11ND((S)/B-S) sense TkCAT17.15.5ND"

Mutation of conserved residues in close proximity to the active site tyrosine (Tyr727 of yeast Top1p) alters the DNA cleavage religation equilibrium, inducing drug-independent cell lethality. Previous studies indicates that yeast Top1T722Ap and Top1N726Hp cytotoxicity results from elevated levels of covalent enzyme-DNA intermediates. Here we show that Top1T722Ap acts as a CPT mimetic by exhibiting reduced rates of DNA religation, whereas increased Top1N726Hp·DNA complexes result from elevated DNA binding and cleavage. We also report that the combination of the T722A and N726H mutations in a single protein potentiates the cytotoxic action of the enzyme beyond that induced by co-expression of the single mutants. Moreover, the addition of CPT to cells expressing the double top1T722A/N726H mutant did not enhance cell lethality. Thus, independent alterations in DNA cleavage and religation contribute to the lethal phenotype. The formation of distinct cytotoxic lesions was also evidenced by the different responses induced by low levels of these self-poisoning enzymes in isogenic strains defective for the Rad9 DNA damage checkpoint, processive DNA replication, or ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Substitution of Asn726 with Phe or Tyr also produces self-poisoning enzymes, implicating stacking interactions in the increased kinetics of DNA cleavage by Top1N726Hp and Top1N726Fp. In contrast, replacing the amide side chain of Asn726 with Gln renders Top1N726Qp resistant to CPT, suggesting that the orientation of the amide within the active site is critical for effective CPT binding.

DNA topoisomerases catalyze changes in the linkage of DNA strands, playing critical roles in DNA replication, transcription, and recombination, as well as chromosome condensation and segregation (reviewed in Refs. 1Champoux J.J.

Rotation of the non-covalently held DNA around the nonscissile DNA strand allows for the relaxation of positive or negative supercoils. In a second transesterification reaction, the 5′-OH nucleophile attacks the phosphotyrosyl linkage to religate the DNA. In eukaryotes, the nuclear type IB enzyme, encoded by the TOP1 gene, is highly conserved in terms of amino acid sequence and catalytic mechanism (1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 3Corbett K.D. Berger J.M.

The nuclear enzyme is also the cellular target of several antitumor agents, such as camptothecin (CPT) and indolocarbazole analogs (reviewed in Refs. 6Pommier Y. Redon C. Rao. V.A. Seiler J.A.

These drugs target Top1p by reversibly stabilizing the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. During S-phase of the cell cycle, the collision of advancing replication forks with the ternary drug·Top1p·DNA complexes produces irreversible DNA lesions that trigger S-phase checkpoint activation, cell cycle arrest, and cell death (1Champoux J.J.

Consistent with this cytotoxic mechanism, cells treated with aphidicolin to inhibit DNA replication are resistant to CPT (11Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Mol. Pharm. 1996; 50: 1095-1102PubMed Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, strains deleted for specific DNA damage and replication checkpoint genes, such as RAD53, MEC1, TEL1, RAD9, RAD17, RAD24, and TOF1, exhibit enhanced sensitivity to CPT and other Top1p poisons (12Megonigal M.D. Fertala J.

Moreover, cells defective in processive DNA replication (because of alterations in Cdc45p or Dpb11p) (18Reid R.J.D. Fiorani P. Sugawara M. Bjornsti M-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3487-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) are also hypersensitive to Top1p-induced DNA lesions. Structural determinations of human Topo-70, a 70-kDa C-terminal fragment of human DNA topoisomerase I, in covalent and noncovalent complexes with duplex DNA, revealed a circumferential binding of DNA by the Top1 protein clamp (3Corbett K.D.

Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Using molecular modeling to design a reversible disulfide bond across the opposable lip domains that complete the clamp, we recently demonstrated that DNA rotation is inhibited within the locked Top1p·clamp·DNA complex (22Woo M.H. Losasso C. Guo H. Pattarello L. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13767-13772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, some flexibility of Top1p protein domains is required for enzyme binding of DNA and the rotation of DNA strands necessary to effect changes in DNA topology. These studies further demonstrated that expression of the catalytically inactive Top1Y723Fp-clamp in yeast cells with elevated levels of oxidized glutathione, also sufficed to induce cell lethality independent of covalent complex formation (22Woo M.H.

More subtle alterations in the DNA cleavage religation equilibrium catalyzed by Top1p have also been shown to be cytotoxic. For example, the introduction of an abasic site or a mismatch at the +1 position in the scissile DNA strand enhances the stabilization of the covalent complex (reviewed in Ref. 23Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structural distortions induced by incorporation of Ara-C at the +1 position of the complementary nonscissile strand also stabilize the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate by reducing DNA religation (24Chrencik J.E.

Based on the lack of detectable alterations in DNA binding or cleavage, a reduced rate of DNA religation by Top1T722Ap was inferred (28Hann C.L. Carlberg A.L. Bjornsti M-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31519-31527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), similar to that induced by CPT (29Porter S.E. Champoux J.J.

Recent structures of the binary Topo-70·DNA and ternary topotecan·Topo-70·DNA complexes indicate the formation of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl of Thr718 and the nonbridging oxygen of the +1 phosphodiester of the DNA (30Staker B.L. Hjerrild K. Feese M.D. Behnke C.A. Burgin A.B. Stewart L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15387-15392Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Thus, substitution of Ala at this position may alter the orientation of the 5′-OH nucleophile and impede DNA religation. A distinct self-poisoning mechanism was evidenced when Asn726 in yeast Top1p (or Asn722 in human Top1) was mutated to His. In this case, enhanced stabilization of the covalent enzyme·DNA complex was attributed to increased rates of DNA cleavage. Here we report that the T722A mutation directly inhibits Top1p-catalyzed DNA religation, while Asn726 substitutions have diverse effects on enzyme sensitivity to CPT, Top1p binding to DNA, and enzyme-catalyzed DNA cleavage. Mutating Asn726 to His, Tyr, or Phe indicates that a phenolic or imidazole side chain enhanced the kinetics of DNA cleavage by Top1p, whereas the CPT resistance of Top1N726Qp suggests the orientation of the amide side chain is critical for effective drug binding. Further, the combination of the T722A and N726H mutations in a single enzyme significantly potentiated the cytotoxic activity of the double mutant beyond that induced by co-expression of the individual mutant enzymes. Biochemical studies indicate that the independent alterations in DNA cleavage and religation, evident in the double mutant, each contribute to the lethal phenotype. Genetic studies further support the notion that these self-poisoning enzymes induce distinct cytotoxic lesions in vivo. These findings suggest that more effective Top1p poisoning may be achieved with a combination of therapeutics inducing distinct alterations in Top1p catalysis.

Swapping a 1.9-kbp Bsu36I-XbaI fragment from YCpGAL1-eTOP1 with corresponding top1 mutant sequences generated YCpGAL1-etop1N726H, and YCpGAL1-etop1N726D. Asn726 was mutated to Gln, Lys, or Phe (top1N726Q, top1N726K, top1N726F, respectively) or Thr722/Asn726 to Ala/His (top1T722A/N726H) with a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and oligonucleotide pairs: NQf (5′-CACTTCCAAAATCGACTATATAGACCCTAGAC-3′) and NQr (5′-GTCTAGGGTCTATATAGTCGATTTTGGAAGTG-3′); NKf (5′-CACTGGGCACTTCCAAAATCAAGTATATAGACCCTAGA-3′) and NKr (5′-TCTAGGGTCTATATACTTGATTTTGGAAGTGCCCAGTG-3′); NFf (5′-CACTGGGCACTTCCAAAATCTTTTATATAGACCCTAGAC-3′) and NFr (5′-GTCTAGGGTCTATATAAAAGATTTTGGAAGTGCCCAGTG-3′); TA/NHf (5′-CTGGGCGCTTCCAAAATCCATTATATAGACC-3′) and TA/NHr (5′-GGTCTATATAATGGATTTTGGAAGCGCCCAG-3′). top1T722A/N726H/Y727F was created in pTP1T722A with NH/YFf (5′-CTTCCAAAATCCATTTTATAGACCCTAGAC-3′) and NH/YFr (5′-GTCTAGGGTCTATAAAATGGATTTTGGAAG-3′). Mutant top1 sequences, excised with Bsu36I and XbaI, were ligated into YCpGAL1-eTOP1, YCpScTOP1, and YCpScTOP1·L vectors to yield YCpGAL1-etop1N726Q, YCpGAL1-etop1N726K, YCpGAL1-etop1N726F, YCpGAL1etop1T722A/N726H, YCpGAL1-etop1T722A/N726H/Y727F, YCpSctop1N726H, YCpSctop1N726D, and a LEU2 marked YcpSctop1·L vector series. Yeast cells were transformed by treatment with lithium acetate (33Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1994: 133-134Google Scholar). URA3 and LEU2 plasmid transformants were maintained on synthetic complete media lacking uracil (SC-uracil) and leucine (SC-leucine), respectively, supplemented with 2% dextrose or 2% galactose. Yeast Cell Viability and Sensitivity to Camptothecin—To determine the viability and CPT sensitivity of top1Δ cells transformed with the TOP1 plasmids, exponential cultures of individual transformants were adjusted to an OD595 of 0.3, serially 10-fold diluted and 5-μl aliquots were spotted onto selective plates supplemented with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 2% dextrose, or galactose, and 0 or 10 μg/ml CPT in final 0.25% Me2SO. Cell viability was scored following incubation at 30 °C. To quantitate cell viability, transformants grown in SC-uracil, dextrose were diluted into SC-uracil, raffinose, grown to an OD595 of 0.3 and induced at t = 0 with 2% galactose. When indicated, 100 μm CPT in final 0.1% Me2SO or 0.1% Me2SO alone was also added at t = 0. At various times, aliquots were serially diluted and plated onto SC-uracil, dextrose plates. The number of viable cells forming colonies was determined following incubation at 30 °C. In transformation assays, isogenic yeast strains EKY3 (top1Δ), MBY3 (top1Δ, rad52Δ) and MMY3 (top1Δ, rad9Δ), RRY71 (top1Δ, dpb11-10), RRY72 (top1Δ, cdc45-10) and RRY92 (top1Δ, doa4-10) were transformed with URA3 marked vectors (YCpScTop1, YCpSctop1N726D, YCpSctop1N726H or YCpSctop1T722A) or LEU2 marked vectors (YcpScTOP1·L, YCpSctop1N726D·L, YCpSctop1N726F·L, YCpSctop1N726H·L, or YCpSctop1T722A·L) and plated onto SC-uracil or SC-leucine, dextrose plates, respectively. Colony number and size were assessed after 3 days incubation at 30 °C. DNA Topoisomerase I Purification and Activity—Top1 proteins were purified from EKY3 cells as described (27Woo M.H. Vance J.R.

Top1 protein integrity and concentration were assessed by immunostaining with yeast Top1p-specific antibodies or the M2 FLAG antibody (Kodak). DNA topoisomerase I activity was assayed by relaxation of super-coiled plasmid DNA as described (25Fertala J. Vance J.R. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Bjornsti M-A. J. Biol.

Briefly, serial 10-fold dilutions of Top1 proteins (corrected for concentration) were incubated in 20-μl reactions with 0.3 μg of negatively supercoiled pHC624 DNA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml gelatin, and 150 mm KCl. Where indicated, final KCl concentrations ranged from 75 to 200 mm. After 1 h at 30 °C, reaction products were resolved in agarose gels and visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. DNA Cleavage Assays—Top1p sensitivity to CPT was assessed in DNA cleavage assays (25Fertala J. Vance J.R. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Bjornsti M-A. J. Biol.

A single 3′ 32P-end-labeled DNA substrate (8,000 cpm) was incubated with Top1 proteins in 50-μl reaction volumes containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml gelatin, and 0 or 50 μm CPT in final 4% Me2SO. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated with 1% SDS and heating to 75 °C, treated with proteinase K, ethanol-precipitated, and resolved in 8% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gels. Cleavage products were visualized with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Suicide Cleavage Reactions—Oligonucleotide-based assays were used to assess relative rates of DNA cleavage catalyzed by wild-type and mutant Top1p. Two approaches were taken. First, suicide substrates contained a truncated scissile strand with a high affinity cleavage site (5′-GATCTAAAAGACTToGGAA-3′) (25Fertala J. Vance J.R. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Bjornsti M-A. J. Biol.

Suicide substrates were also generated in which a longer scissile strand contained a bridging phosphorothiolate linkage at the cleavage site (indicated by “s” in 5′-GATCTAAAAGACTTsGGAAAATTTTTAAAAAAGATC-3′). Synthesis of the phosphorothiolates was as described (35Burgin A.B. Huizenga B.N. Nash H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2973-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were 3′-end-labeled with [32P]cordycepin using terminal deoxynucleotide transferase. A modified buffer (100 mm MES, pH 6.8, 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol) was used with phosphorothiolated oligonucleotides to avoid Co2+-induced cleavage. The labeled strands were annealed to equimolar amounts of complementary strands (5′-GATCTTTTTTAAAAATTTTCCAAGTCTTTTAGATC-3′ or 5′-GATCGCACCCCAGGCTTTACACTTTATGCTTCCGGC-3′) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol by heating to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. In cleavage reactions, equal concentrations of Top1 proteins were incubated at 25 °C with 20 fmol of substrate DNA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, and 50 μg/ml gelatin. At various times, 10-μl aliquots of the reaction mixtures were terminated with 0.5% SDS and heating to 75 °C. The reaction products were resolved in 20% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gels and visualized with a PhosphorImager. DNA Religation—DNA religation was assessed using oligonucleotide-based religation assays. The 5′-end of the DNA scissile strand (5′-GATCTAAAAGACTT↓GG-3′), where ↓ indicates the site of Top1 cleavage, was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Equimolar amounts of the labeled DNA strand were annealed to the nonscissile strand (5′-GATCTTTTTTAAAAATTTTTCCAAGTCTTTTAGATC-3′), as described for the suicide substrates. The DNA substrate (40 pmol/reaction aliquot) was incubated with a 10-fold excess of the religation strand (5′-GGAAAAATTTTTAAAAAAGATC-3′) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, and 50 μg/ml gelatin. Equal concentrations of Top1 proteins were added, and at the times indicated, 10-μl aliquots were quenched with 0.5% SDS and heating to 75 °C. Alternatively, the annealed DNA substrate was incubated in the same reaction buffer with equal concentrations of purified Top1 proteins for 10 min at 25 °C. A 10-fold excess of religation substrate was added, and the samples were treated as above. Reaction products were resolved in 16% acrylamide/7 m urea gels and visualized with a PhosphorImager. DNA Binding Assays—DNA binding assays were as described (28Hann C.L. Carlberg A.L. Bjornsti M-A. J. Biol.

Briefly, a 32P-labeled 107-base pair DNA fragment containing a high affinity DNA topoisomerase I binding site was generated by PCR amplification of pBlueAK3-1 (34Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of eTop1 proteins were incubated in 140-μl reactions with 5 μg of biotinylated M2 antibody (Sigma) and 25 μl of streptavidin-coated beads (Pierce) in 20 mm phosphate (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl for 1 h on ice. The beads were washed with 250 μl of 20 mm phosphate (pH 7.0) and 1 m NaCl, equilibrated with 2× 250-μl volumes of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml gelatin, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at 4 °C with ∼12,000 cpm (50–100 fmol) of 32P-labeled DNA in 250 μl of binding buffer in cellulose acetate microcentrifuge spin columns (Micron Separations Inc.). Where indicated, the KCl concentration was increased to 75 or 100 mm. After 10 min, the unbound DNA was eluted by centrifugation, and the beads washed with an additional 250 μl of binding buffer. The radioactivity in combined eluant and bead-bound fractions was counted in a Beckman LS801 liquid scintillation counter. The percentage of bound DNA was calculated as (bead-bound cpm)/(bead-bound cpm) + (combined eluant cpm). In side-by-side reactions, the concentration of bead-bound protein was determined in immunoblots with the M2 antibody, in comparison with known concentrations of homogeneous eTop1p. Column fractions prepared from top1Δ strains were included as controls.
