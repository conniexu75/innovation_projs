https://openalex.org/W2058743369,"A surface having a spatial gradient in its surface free energy was capable of causing drops of water placed on it to move uphill. This motion was the result of an imbalance in the forces due to surface tension acting on the liquid-solid contact line on the two opposite sides (""uphill"" or ""downhill"") of the drop. The required gradient in surface free energy was generated on the surface of a polished silicon wafer by exposing it to the diffusing front of a vapor of decyltrichlorosilane, Cl(3)Si(CH(2))(9)CH(3). The resulting surface displayed a gradient of hydrophobicity (with the contact angle of water changing from 97 degrees to 25 degrees ) over a distance of 1 centimeter. When the wafer was tilted from the horizontal plane by 15 degrees , with the hydrophobic end lower than the hydrophilic, and a drop of water (1 to 2 microliters) was placed at the hydrophobic end, the drop moved toward the hydrophilic end with an average velocity of approximately 1 to 2 millimeters per second. In order for the drop to move, the hysteresis in contact angle on the surface had to be low (</=10 degrees )."
https://openalex.org/W1981937780,"Analysis of the many experiments on high-temperature superconductivity indicate several essential aspects of any theory. The conductivity and other transport properties as a function of disorder, temperature, and frequency point to a non-Fermi liquid-like behavior, whereas photoemission experiments and magnetic properties indicate the presence of a Fermi surface in momentum space. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, a new type of electron liquid, called a Luttinger liquid, has been postulated, and the present article aims to show the need for this postulate. Theory and experiment indicate that the suitable phenomenological electronic structure model of the CuO layers is that of the one-band Hubbard model. It is also argued that experiment clearly indicates that interlayer interactions strongly affect the superconducting transition temperature, T(c), consistent with the fact that no theoretical calculations on two-dimensional Hubbard models have resulted in the prediction of high transition temperatures, and that anyon models are not favored by experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2069155847,"Time-dependent crack growth has been measured on a precracked, single-crystal silicon cantilever beam 75 micrometers long that was excited at resonance. Growth of the precrack changes the resonant frequency of the beam, which is correlated to crack length. The measured steady-state crack growth rate was as slow as 2.9 x 10(-13) meter per second, although the apparatus can measure crack growth rates as low as 10(-15) meter per second. It is postulated that static fatigue of the native surface silica layer is the mechanism for crack growth. These experiments demonstrate the possibility of rate-dependent failure of silicon devices and the applicability of linear elastic fracture mechanics to small-scale micromechanical devices. The results indicate that slow crack growth must therefore be considered when evaluating the reliability of thin-film silicon structures."
https://openalex.org/W1998568283,"The larva of the green lacewing Chrysopa slossonae lives in colonies of the wooly alder aphid Prociphilus tesselatus upon which it feeds. It disguises itself as its prey by plucking some of the waxy ""wool"" from the bodies of the aphids and applying this material to its own back. The investiture protects it from assault by the ants that ordinarily ""shepherd"" the aphids. Larvae artifically denuded are seized by the ants and removed from the aphid colonies. A larva requires on the average less than 20 minutes to coat itself with wax. A hungry denuded larva gives the coating procedure about the same behavioral priority as feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2075425739,"Association of Themeda triandra, a palatable grass species, with less palatable plants protected it from grazing by two comparatively unselective herbivores, wildebeest and African buffalo. Grazing on T. triandra by two more selective herbivores, Thomson's gazelle and zebra, was not related to the relative abundance of less palatable plants. The differential effectiveness of plant defense guilds against different ungulates may contribute to the high species diversity of the East African grazer fauna."
https://openalex.org/W2057357867,"The rhodium porphyrin-catalyzed cyclopropanation of alkenes by ethyl diazoacetate (EDA) is representative of a number of metal-mediated cyclopropanation reactions used widely in organic synthesis. The active intermediate in these reactions is thought to be a metal carbene complex, but evidence for the involvement of metal-olefin pi complexes has also been presented. Low-temperature infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies have been used to characterize a rhodium porphyrin-diazoalkyl adduct that results from the stoichiometric condensation of the catalyst and EDA. Optical spectroscopy suggests that this complex is the dominant steady-state species in the catalytic reaction. This compound decomposes thermally to provide cyclopropanes in the presence of styrene, suggesting that the carbene is indeed the active intermediate. Metal-alkene pi complexes have also been detected spectroscopically. Kinetic studies suggest that they mediate the rate of carbene formation from the diazoalkyl complex but are not attacked directly by EDA."
https://openalex.org/W1994816780,"Rate constants for the dissociation of highly vibrationally excited ketene (CH2CO) have been measured at the threshold for the production of CH2(3B1) and CO(1σ+). The rate constant increases in a stepwise manner with increasing energy, consistent with the long-standing premise that the rate of a unimolecular reaction is controlled by flux through quantized transition-state thresholds. The data give the energies of the torsional and C-C-O bending vibrations of the transition state."
https://openalex.org/W2022642646,Four volatile chemical compounds have been identified as apparently unique constituents in urines of red foxes (both sexes) during the winter season when mating occurs. Quinaldine was found only in male fox urine. Several other compounds identified are found in other species also. Some or all of these compounds may function in olfactory communication in the red fox.
https://openalex.org/W2082384264,"On the way from reactants to products, a chemical reaction passes through what chemists term the transition state-for a brief moment, the participants in the reaction may look like one large molecule ready to fall apart. The nature of this elusive state is the subject of a number of exciting recent developments that involve theory and experiment
in the study of chemical reaction rates. They include time-resolved studies of molecules in the transition state region, spectrcopic observations of that region, reactive scattering state-to-state cross sections for 
reactions such as H + H_2 → H_2 + H, and experimental/theoretical studies of electron transfer processes in the condensed phase. The experiments of
Lovejoy et al. described in this issue of Science involve the fundamental question of the quantization of vibrational energy levels of the transition state and its
implications for unimolecular reaction rate theory."
https://openalex.org/W1996095385,A linear transfer function analysis has been applied to gravity and topographic data from Australia to calculate the isostatic response function of Dorman and Lewis. The Australian response function is considerably different from that calculated for the United States. The differences can be explained on the basis of an apparent evolution of the isostatic compensation mechanism in which viscoelastic creep occurs in the lithosphere and relaxes the initial long-wavelength elastic stresses.
https://openalex.org/W1964914084,"The properties of microspherules recovered from an Upper Devonian marine limestone immediately overlain by a geochemical anomaly of siderophile and chalcophile elements are similar to those of impact-derived microtektites. These microspherules are glass, have splash-form shapes, contain spherical vesicles and lechatelierite inclusions, and show oxide compositional variations similar to those in known microtektites. These characteristics suggest that these Upper Devonian microspherules have an impact origin. A bolide impact may have occurred about 365 million years ago on the South China Plate and caused a faunal extinction on eastern Gondwana."
https://openalex.org/W1970153735,A proton microprobe capable of focusing proton beams with energies up to 6 million electron volts to a spot size of 2 x 2 square micrometers has been used for chemical analysis of small grains of minerals in lunar samples by proton-induced x-ray emission. The proton microprobe is preferable to the electron microprobe for analyzing trace elements whose concentrations are below the detection limit of the latter and for analyzing objects with numerous major and trace elements with a wide range of atomic numbers. Application of the proton microprobe to biological samples is feasible.
https://openalex.org/W2061932824,"Lunar paleomagnetism provides evidence for the existence of an ancient lunar magnetic field generated in an iron core. Paleointensity experiments give a surface field of 1.3 gauss, 4.0 × 109 years ago, subsequently decreasing exponentially. Thermodynamic arguments give a minimum value of the heat source in the core at that time: known sources, radioactive and other, are quantitatively implausible, and it is suggested that superheavy elements were present in the early moon."
https://openalex.org/W2035469190,"Excess (4)He (more than five times the solubility) has been measured in Teggau Lake in northwestern Ontario. A model suggests that an adjacent mass of greater than 10(4) kilograms of uranium is responsible for the observed (4)He excess. The area is favorable for pegmatitic uranium deposits, and the release of trapped (4)He from uraninite dikes larger than 30 cubic meters (1 percent U(3)O(8)) provides the best explanation for the excess (4)He in the lake."

https://openalex.org/W2091112420,"The phenomenon of ocean waves breaking on a beach is analogous to shock waves in the atmosphere of a pulsating star. In both cases a velocity discontinuity is clearly present. In stars the upper, expanding layer halts and falls back so as to interact with the rising gas at a shock. Similarly, a bore on a beach reaches its maximum extension before sliding back onto the next incoming wave. Analogous quantities such as the surface gravity of the star and the beach gradient in the ocean have similar effects on the flows and the nature of the discontinuity between them. Phenomena that are not analogous include the thermodynamic properties of the two media. Ocean observations may help solve some problems in shock phenomena associated with stellar pulsation."
