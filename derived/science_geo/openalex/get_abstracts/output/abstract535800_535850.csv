https://openalex.org/W1687468892,"Resting state functional MRI (fMRI) has enabled description of group-level functional brain organization at multiple spatial scales. However, cross-subject averaging may obscure patterns of brain organization specific to each individual. Here, we characterized the brain organization of a single individual repeatedly measured over more than a year. We report a reproducible and internally valid subject-specific areal-level parcellation that corresponds with subject-specific task activations. Highly convergent correlation network estimates can be derived from this parcellation if sufficient data are collected—considerably more than typically acquired. Notably, within-subject correlation variability across sessions exhibited a heterogeneous distribution across the cortex concentrated in visual and somato-motor regions, distinct from the pattern of intersubject variability. Further, although the individual’s systems-level organization is broadly similar to the group, it demonstrates distinct topological features. These results provide a foundation for studies of individual differences in cortical organization and function, especially for special or rare individuals.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIwYjA0MmZhZWFkOGIwNGZlYzZkMTMxZDJmZjUyNjg3NSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4Njk5MjU4fQ.Qpto5f06dxuLKybisQ-dLT9a70eXn8tCVihtJnjdkOmiiRnEzxhljRvTL653QJ3DROgfQaa6rLmDBdljOi91yzFXDwUVLYrS8k9tNYemQw0jIaupBDD7LNv9KivaAEWykGJ8F44u8SAIN32dmbVHhdfVitF8v6JxgngrSCDPIbbawOvVZkqsS3WMJIaDFUS8tlhLqJy1GkKRJIhhoen2phUZVvyv3dwB5az8GZMw-vckGVHe-3R5j1xu7FmzN5lrxXOhv_PAjuvbe3EwZxr3EW4QwNwFn08gS9Vra3ATKaL6xYc4H8ONpw4zzUdkO4R8NZDywxdDm3U_lQJdsVY-6A(mp4, (48.18 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W1745700293,"The locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NE) system is one of the first systems engaged following a stressful event. While numerous groups have demonstrated that LC-NE neurons are activated by many different stressors, the underlying neural circuitry and the role of this activity in generating stress-induced anxiety has not been elucidated. Using a combination of in vivo chemogenetics, optogenetics, and retrograde tracing, we determine that increased tonic activity of the LC-NE system is necessary and sufficient for stress-induced anxiety and aversion. Selective inhibition of LC-NE neurons during stress prevents subsequent anxiety-like behavior. Exogenously increasing tonic, but not phasic, activity of LC-NE neurons is alone sufficient for anxiety-like and aversive behavior. Furthermore, endogenous corticotropin-releasing hormone(+) (CRH(+)) LC inputs from the amygdala increase tonic LC activity, inducing anxiety-like behaviors. These studies position the LC-NE system as a critical mediator of acute stress-induced anxiety and offer a potential intervention for preventing stress-related affective disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2098669942,"Hemophilia A is an X-linked genetic disorder caused by mutations in the F8 gene, which encodes the blood coagulation factor VIII. Almost half of all severe hemophilia A cases result from two gross (140-kbp or 600-kbp) chromosomal inversions that involve introns 1 and 22 of the F8 gene, respectively. We derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with these inversion genotypes and used CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases to revert these chromosomal segments back to the WT situation. We isolated inversion-corrected iPSCs with frequencies of up to 6.7% without detectable off-target mutations based on whole-genome sequencing or targeted deep sequencing. Endothelial cells differentiated from corrected iPSCs expressed the F8 gene and functionally rescued factor VIII deficiency in an otherwise lethal mouse model of hemophilia. Our results therefore provide a proof of principle for functional correction of large chromosomal rearrangements in patient-derived iPSCs and suggest potential therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W1704871680,"Neuronal responses of sensory cortex are highly variable, and this variability is correlated across neurons. To assess how variability reflects factors shared across a neuronal population, we analyzed the activity of many simultaneously recorded neurons in visual cortex. We developed a simple model that comprises two sources of shared variability: a multiplicative gain, which uniformly scales each neuron's sensory drive, and an additive offset, which affects different neurons to different degrees. This model captured the variability of spike counts and reproduced the dependence of pairwise correlations on neuronal tuning and stimulus orientation. The relative contributions of the additive and multiplicative fluctuations could vary over time and had marked impact on population coding. These observations indicate that shared variability of neuronal populations in sensory cortex can be largely explained by two factors that modulate the whole population."
https://openalex.org/W1672380741,"Peritoneal metastasis is the most frequent type of recurrence in patients with gastric cancer (GC) and is associated with poor prognosis. Peritoneal lavage cytology, used to evaluate the risk of peritoneal metastasis, has low sensitivity. Here, we assessed the diagnostic potential of exosomal miRNA profiles in peritoneal fluid for the prediction of peritoneal dissemination in GC. Total RNA was extracted from exosomes isolated from six gastric malignant ascites (MA) samples, 24 peritoneal lavage fluid (PLF) samples, and culture supernatants (CM) of two human gastric carcinoma cell lines that differ in their potential for peritoneal metastasis. Expression of exosomal miRNAs was evaluated with Agilent Human miRNA microarrays and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The microarray analysis indicated a low variability in the number and signal intensity of miRNAs detected among the samples. In the six MA fluids, miR-21 showed the highest signal intensity. We identified five miRNAs (miR-1225-5p, miR-320c, miR-1202, miR-1207-5p, and miR-4270) with high expression in MA samples, the PLF of serosa-invasive GC, and the CM of a highly metastatic GC cell line; these candidate miRNA species appear to be related to peritoneal dissemination. Differential expression of miR-21, miR-320c, and miR-1225-5p was validated in the PLF of serosa-invasive and non-invasive GC by qRT-PCR and miR-21 and miR-1225-5p were confirmed to be associated with serosal invasion in GC. PLF can be used to profile the expression of exosomal miRNAs. Our findings suggest that miR-21 and miR-1225-5p may serve as biomarkers of peritoneal recurrence after curative GC resection, thus providing a novel approach to early diagnosis of peritoneal dissemination of GC."
https://openalex.org/W1690408836,"Exposure to maternal tissue during in utero development imprints tolerance to immunologically foreign non-inherited maternal antigens (NIMA) that persists into adulthood. The biological advantage of this tolerance, conserved across mammalian species, remains unclear. Here, we show maternal cells that establish microchimerism in female offspring during development promote systemic accumulation of immune suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) with NIMA specificity. NIMA-specific Tregs expand during pregnancies sired by males expressing alloantigens with overlapping NIMA specificity, thereby averting fetal wastage triggered by prenatal infection and non-infectious disruptions of fetal tolerance. Therefore, exposure to NIMA selectively enhances reproductive success in second-generation females carrying embryos with overlapping paternally inherited antigens. These findings demonstrate that genetic fitness, canonically thought to be restricted to Mendelian inheritance, is enhanced in female placental mammals through vertically transferred maternal cells that promote conservation of NIMA and enforce cross-generational reproductive benefits."
https://openalex.org/W1037161726,"In the tumor microenvironment, chemokine system has a critical role in tumorigenesis and metastasis. The acquisition of stem-like properties by cancer cells is involved in metastasis and drug resistance, which are pivotal problems that result in poor outcomes in patients with lung cancer. Patients with advanced lung cancer present high plasma levels of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1), which correlate with poor prognostic features. Therefore, TGFβ1 may be important in the tumor microenvironment, where chemokines are widely expressed. However, the role of chemokines in TGFβ1-induced tumor progression still remains unclear. In our study, TGFβ1 upregulated CXC chemokine receptor expression, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) formation in lung adenocarcinoma. We found that CXCR7 was the most upregulated chemokine receptor induced by TGFβ1. CXCR7 knockdown resulted in reduction of migration, invasion and EMT induced by TGFβ1, whereas CXCR4 knockdown did not reverse TGFβ1-promoted EMT. CXCR7 silencing significantly decreased cancer sphere-forming capacity, stem-like properties, chemoresistance and TGFβ1-induced CSC tumor initiation in vivo. In clinical samples, high TGFβ1 and CXCR7 expression was significantly associated with the late stages of lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, TGFβ1 and CXCR7 coexpression was positively correlated with the CSC marker, CD44, which is associated with lymph node metastasis. Besides, patients with high expression of both CXCR7 and TGFβ1 presented a significantly worse survival rate. These results suggest that the TGFβ1-CXCR7 axis may be a prognostic marker and may provide novel targets for combinational therapies to be used in the treatment of advanced lung cancer in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2286838622,"To characterize subgroups of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) and short-term neonatal outcomes based on the presence and absence of intraamniotic inflammation (IAI) and/or microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC).One hundred and sixty-six Caucasian women with singleton pregnancies were included in this study. Amniotic fluid samples were obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis (n=166) and were assayed for interleukin-6 levels by a lateral flow immunoassay. The presence of Ureaplasma species, Mycoplasma hominis, Chlamydia trachomatis, and 16S rRNA was evaluated in the amniotic fluid. IAI was defined as amniotic fluid IL-6 values, measured by a point of care test, higher than 745 pg/mL.Microbial-associated IAI (IAI with MIAC) and sterile intraamniotic inflammation (IAI alone) were found in 21% and 4%, respectively, of women with PPROM. Women with microbial-associated IAI had higher microbial loads of Ureaplasma species in the amniotic fluid than women with MIAC alone. No differences in the short-term neonatal morbidity with respect to the presence of microbial-associated IAI, sterile IAI and MIAC alone were found after adjusting for the gestational age at delivery in women with PPROM.Microbial-associated but not sterile intraamniotic inflammation is common in Caucasian women with PPROM. The gestational age at delivery but not the presence of inflammation affects the short-term neonatal morbidity of newborns from PPROM pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W2121870672,"Interleukin-1 receptor type 2 (IL1R2) acts as a decoy receptor of exogenous IL-1; however, its intracellular activity is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that IL1R2 intracellularly activates the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines and affects cell migration. In this study, we found that intracellular IL1R2 expression was increased in human colorectal cancer cells (CRCs) compared with normal colon cells. We also observed that the mRNA levels of IL1R2 were highly correlated with IL-6 in tumor tissues of CRC patients. By modulating its expression in CRC cells, we verified that enhanced IL1R2 expression transcriptionally activated the expression of IL-6 and VEGF-A. Conditioned medium harvested from IL1R2-overexpressing CRC cells contained higher levels of IL-6 and VEGF-A than that from vector control cells and significantly enhanced the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of cultured endothelial cells. We further demonstrated a positive association of intracellular IL1R2 levels with tumor growth and microvessel density in xenograft mouse models. These results revealed that IL1R2 activates the expression of angiogenic factors. Mechanistically, we revealed that IL1R2 complexes with c-Fos and binds to the AP-1 site at the IL-6 and VEGF-A promoters. Together, these results reveal a novel function of intracellular IL1R2 that acts with c-Fos to enhance the transcription of IL-6 and VEGF-A, which promotes angiogenesis in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2338786655,"Increased metabolism and insufficient blood supply cause acidic waste product accumulation in solid cancers. During carcinogenesis, cellular acid extrusion is upregulated but the underlying molecular mechanisms and their consequences for cancer growth and progression have not been established. Genome-wide association studies have indicated a possible link between the Na+,HCO3–-cotransporter NBCn1 (SLC4A7) and breast cancer. We tested the functional consequences of NBCn1 knockout (KO) for breast cancer development. NBCn1 protein expression increased 2.5-fold during breast carcinogenesis and was responsible for the increased net acid extrusion and alkaline intracellular pH of breast cancer compared with normal breast tissue. Genetic disruption of NBCn1 delayed breast cancer development: tumor latency was ~50% increased while tumor growth rate was ~65% reduced in NBCn1 KO compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Breast cancer histopathology in NBCn1 KO mice differed from that in WT mice and included less aggressive tumor types. The extracellular tumor microenvironment in NBCn1 KO mice contained higher concentrations of glucose and lower concentrations of lactate than that in WT mice. Independently of NBCn1 genotype, the cleaved fraction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 and expression of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1 increased while phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1 decreased as functions of tumor volume. Cell proliferation, evaluated from Ki-67 and phospho-histone H3 staining, was ~60% lower in breast cancer of NBCn1 KO than that of WT mice when corrected for variations in tumor size. We conclude that NBCn1 facilitates acid extrusion from breast cancer tissue, maintains the alkaline intracellular environment and promotes aggressive cancer development and growth."
https://openalex.org/W2161657697,"A number of studies have used GPS technology to categorise rugby union locomotive demands. However, the utility of the results of these studies is confounded by small sample sizes, sub-elite player status and the global application of absolute speed thresholds to all player positions. Furthermore, many of these studies have used GPS units with low sampling frequencies. The aim of the present study was to compare and contrast the high speed running (HSR) demands of professional rugby union when utilizing micro-technology units sampling at 10 Hz and applying relative or individualised speed zones. The results of this study indicate that application of individualised speed zones results in a significant shift in the interpretation of the HSR demands of both forwards and backs and positional sub-categories therein. When considering the use of an absolute in comparison to an individualised HSR threshold, there was a significant underestimation for forwards of HSR distance (HSRD) (absolute = 269 ± 172.02, individualised = 354.72 ± 99.22, p < 0.001), HSR% (absolute = 5.15 ± 3.18, individualised = 7.06 ± 2.48, p < 0.001) and HSR efforts (HSRE) (absolute = 18.81 ± 12.25; individualised = 24.78 ± 8.30, p < 0.001). In contrast, there was a significant overestimation of the same HSR metrics for backs with the use of an absolute threshold (HSRD absolute = 697.79 ± 198.11, individualised = 570.02 ± 171.14, p < 0.001; HSR% absolute = 10.85 ± 2.82, individualised = 8.95 ± 2.76, p < 0.001; HSRE absolute = 41.55 ± 11.25; individualised = 34.54 ± 9.24, p < 0.001). This under- or overestimation associated with an absolute speed zone applies to varying degrees across the ten positional sub-categories analyzed and also to individuals within the same positional sub-category. The results of the present study indicated that although use of an individulised HSR threshold improves the interpretation of the HSR demands on a positional basis, inter-individual variability in maximum velocity within positional sub-categories means that players need to be considered on an individual basis to accurately gauge the HSR demands of rugby union."
https://openalex.org/W1669794305,"Recently, we showed that intracerebroventricular (IC) transplantation of human umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) significantly attenuates posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) and brain damage after severe IVH in newborn rats. This study was performed to determine the optimal route for transplanting MSCs for severe IVH by comparing IC transplantation, intravenous (IV) transplantation, and IV transplantation plus mannitol infusion. Severe IVH was induced by injecting 100 uL of blood into each ventricle of Sprague-Dawley rats on postnatal day 4 (P4). After confirming severe IVH with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at P5, human UCB-derived MSCs were transplanted at P6 by an IC route (1×105), an IV route (5×105), or an IV route with mannitol infused. Follow-up brain MRIs and rotarod tests were performed. At P32, brain tissue samples were obtained for biochemical and histological analyses. Although more MSCs localized to the brain after IC than after IV delivery, both methods were equally effective in preventing PHH; attenuating impaired rotarod test; increasing the number of TUNEL-positive cells, inflammatory cytokines, and astrogliosis; and reducing corpus callosal thickness and myelin basic protein expression after severe IVH regardless of mannitol co-infusion. Despite the superior delivery efficacy with IC than with the IV route, both IC and IV transplantation of MSCs had equal therapeutic efficacy in protecting against severe IVH. These findings suggest that the less invasive IV route might be a good alternative for clinically unstable, very preterm infants that cannot tolerate a more invasive IC delivery of MSCs."
https://openalex.org/W1029242850,"The high cost of hydrolytic enzymes impedes the commercial production of lignocellulosic biofuels. High enzyme loadings are required in part due to their non-productive adsorption to lignin, a major component of biomass. Despite numerous studies documenting cellulase adsorption to lignin, few attempts have been made to engineer enzymes to reduce lignin binding. In this work, we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to elucidate the structural basis for the lignin affinity of Trichoderma reesei Cel7A carbohydrate binding module (CBM). T. reesei Cel7A CBM mutants were produced with a Talaromyces emersonii Cel7A catalytic domain and screened for their binding to cellulose and lignin. Mutation of aromatic and polar residues on the planar face of the CBM greatly decreased binding to both cellulose and lignin, supporting the hypothesis that the cellulose-binding face is also responsible for lignin affinity. Cellulose and lignin affinity of the 31 mutants were highly correlated, although several mutants displayed selective reductions in lignin or cellulose affinity. Four mutants with increased cellulose selectivity (Q2A, H4A, V18A, and P30A) did not exhibit improved hydrolysis of cellulose in the presence of lignin. Further reduction in lignin affinity while maintaining a high level of cellulose affinity is thus necessary to generate an enzyme with improved hydrolysis capability. This work provides insights into the structural underpinnings of lignin affinity, identifies residues amenable to mutation without compromising cellulose affinity, and informs engineering strategies for family one CBMs."
https://openalex.org/W1642891300,"The bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) mediates cellular proliferation, mitogenesis, inflammation, and angiogenesis. These biologies are mediated through S1P binding to specific GPCRs [sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR)1-5] and some other less well-characterized intracellular targets. Ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins, a family of adaptor molecules linking the cortical actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, are emerging as critical regulators of cancer invasion via regulation of cell morphology and motility. Recently, we identified S1P as an acute ERM activator (via phosphorylation) through its action on S1PR2. In this work, we dissect the mechanism of S1P generation downstream of epidermal growth factor (EGF) leading to ERM phosphorylation and cancer invasion. Using pharmacologic inhibitors, small interfering RNA technologies, and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that sphingosine kinase (SK)2, and not SK1, is essential and sufficient in EGF-mediated ERM phosphorylation in HeLa cells. In fact, knocking down SK2 decreased ERM activation 2.5-fold. Furthermore, we provide evidence that SK2 is necessary to mediate EGF-induced invasion. In addition, overexpressing SK2 causes a 2-fold increase in HeLa cell invasion. Surprisingly, and for the first time, we find that this event, although dependent on S1PR2 activation, does not generate and does not require extracellular S1P secretion, therefore introducing a potential novel model of autocrine/intracrine action of S1P that still involves its GPCRs. These results define new mechanistic insights for EGF-mediated invasion and novel actions of SK2, therefore setting the stage for novel targets in the treatment of growth factor-driven malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1914436425,"Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer that strikes both adults and children and is frequently resistant to therapy. Thus, identifying signals needed for AML propagation is a critical step toward developing new approaches for treating this disease. Here, we show that Tetraspanin 3 is a target of the RNA binding protein Musashi 2, which plays a key role in AML. We generated Tspan3 knockout mice that were born without overt defects. However, Tspan3 deletion impaired leukemia stem cell self-renewal and disease propagation and markedly improved survival in mouse models of AML. Additionally, Tspan3 inhibition blocked growth of AML patient samples, suggesting that Tspan3 is also important in human disease. As part of the mechanism, we show that Tspan3 deficiency disabled responses to CXCL12/SDF-1 and led to defects in AML localization within the niche. These identify Tspan3 as an important regulator of aggressive leukemias and highlight a role for Tspan3 in oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W974353170,"Membrane overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB-2 (MErbB-2) accounts for a clinically aggressive breast cancer (BC) subtype (ErbB-2-positive) with increased incidence of metastases. We and others demonstrated that nuclear ErbB-2 (NErbB-2) also plays a key role in BC and is a poor prognostic factor in ErbB-2-positive tumors. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), another player in BC, has been recognized as a downstream mediator of MErbB-2 action in BC metastasis. Here, we revealed an unanticipated novel direction of the ErbB-2 and Stat3 interaction underlying BC metastasis. We found that Stat3 binds to its response elements (GAS) at the ErbB-2 promoter to upregulate ErbB-2 transcription in metastatic, ErbB-2-positive BC. We validated these results in several BC subtypes displaying metastatic and non-metastatic ability, highlighting Stat3 general role as upstream regulator of ErbB-2 expression in BC. Moreover, we showed that Stat3 co-opts NErbB-2 function by recruiting ErbB-2 as its coactivator at the GAS sites in the promoter of microRNA-21 (miR-21), a metastasis-promoting microRNA (miRNA). Using an ErbB-2 nuclear localization domain mutant and a constitutively activated ErbB-2 variant, we found that NErbB-2 role as a Stat3 coactivator and also its direct role as transcription factor upregulate miR-21 in BC. This reveals a novel function of NErbB-2 as a regulator of miRNAs expression. Increased levels of miR-21, in turn, downregulate the expression of the metastasis-suppressor protein programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a validated miR-21 target. Using an in vivo model of metastatic ErbB-2-postive BC, in which we silenced Stat3 and reconstituted ErbB-2 or miR-21 expression, we showed that both are downstream mediators of Stat3-driven metastasis. Supporting the clinical relevance of our results, we found an inverse correlation between ErbB-2/Stat3 nuclear co-expression and PDCD4 expression in ErbB-2-positive primary invasive BCs. Our findings identify Stat3 and NErbB-2 as novel therapeutic targets to inhibit ErbB-2-positive BC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1882379407,"Rab small GTPases are crucial regulators of the membrane traffic that maintains organelle identity and morphology. Several Rab isoforms are present in the Golgi, and it has been suggested that they regulate the compacted morphology of the Golgi in mammalian cells. However, the functional relationships among the Golgi-resident Rabs, e.g. whether they are functionally redundant or different, are poorly understood. In this study, we used specific siRNAs to perform genome-wide screening for human Rabs that are involved in Golgi morphology in HeLa-S3 cells. The results showed that knockdown of any one of the six Rab isoforms (Rab1A/1B/2A/2B/6B/8A) induced fragmentation of the Golgi in HeLa-S3 cells and that its phenotype was rescued by re-expression of their respective siRNA-resistant construct. We then performed systematic knockdown-rescue experiments in relation to each of the six Rabs. Interestingly, with the exception of the Rab8A knockdown, the Golgi fragmentation phenotype induced by knockdown of a single Rab isoform, e.g. Rab2B, was efficiently rescued by re-expression of its siRNA-resistant Rab alone, not by any of the other five Rabs, e.g. Rab2A, which is highly homologous to Rab2B, indicating that these Rab isoforms non-redundantly regulate Golgi morphology possibly through interaction with isoform-specific effector molecules.

Thus, membrane trafficking within the Golgi or between the Golgi and other organelles appears to be important for maintenance of the identity and morphology of the Golgi (9Liu S. Storrie B. How Rab proteins determine Golgi structure.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2015; 315: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to their membrane trafficking roles, Rab small GTPases may be structurally involved in the stacked cisternal structures of the Golgi of mammalian cells because Golgi matrix proteins, e.g. golgin family members, are known to bind a variety of Golgi Rabs mainly through their coiled-coil domains (18Barr F.A.

To answer several of the remaining unanswered questions, in this study, we comprehensively screened for Rabs that regulate the morphology of the Golgi of HeLa-S3 cells by knocking down each of the 62 known human classical Rabs. The results showed that at least six Rab isoforms, Rab1A, Rab1B, Rab2A, Rab2B, Rab6B, and Rab8A, are independently required for a compacted Golgi and that knockdown of any one of the Rab isoforms alone induced fragmentation of the Golgi. We also identified Golgi-associated Rab2B interactor-like 4 (GARI-L4) 2The abbreviations used are: GARI-LGolgi-associated Rab2B interactor-likeCAconstitutively activeCNconstitutively negativeEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinGARIGolgi-associated Rab2B interactormRabmouse RabmStrmonomeric StrawberrySRsiRNA-resistantstsite. as a novel specific Rab2B-binding protein that is also required for the Golgi morphology of HeLa-S3 cells.

HeLa-S3 cells and COS-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin under 5% CO2. One day after plating, plasmids and/or siRNAs were transfected into cultured cells by using Lipofectamine LTX, Lipofectamine 2000, or Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies), each according to the manufacturer's instructions. At least three different siRNAs against each human Rab and human GARI-L4 (site (st) 1 target sequence, 5′-GAGCCAACCTTACTACAAA-3′; st2 target sequence, 5′-GACGGTTGGTTCTATGACA-3′) were chemically synthesized by Nippon Gene Co., Ltd. (Toyama, Japan). The knockdown efficiency of the siRNAs against each Rab was evaluated by co-expressing siRNA and pEGFP-C1-Rab (or pEGFP-C1-RabSR) in COS-7 cells, and one or more effective siRNAs for each Rab was selected. Knockdown of endogenous Rab proteins in HeLa-S3 cells (see Fig. 4B) was achieved by transfecting 2 pmol of siRNAs into HeLa-S3 cells in a 6-cm dish. Three days after transfection, the cells were harvested, and Rab knockdown efficiency was evaluated by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Because the anti-Rab6B antibody used in this study recognized both Rab6A and Rab6B, knockdown of endogenous Rab6B was evaluated by using 0.5 pmol of Rab6A siRNA (e.g. 1.5 pmol of Rab6B siRNA + 0.5 pmol of Rab6A siRNA; total, 2 pmol) to partially reduce the Rab6A protein level (Fig. 4B). HeLa-S3 cells were cultured on glass-bottomed dishes (35-mm dish; MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and transfected with siRNAs and/or plasmids as described above. Three days after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and then stained with anti-GM130 antibody (1:1000 dilution) and DAPI as described previously (36Kuroda T.S.

The stained cells were examined for immunofluorescence signals with a confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscope (Fluoview 1000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and the images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software (CS5). More than 50 cells were analyzed to obtain the results of the Golgi fragmentation assays shown in Fig. 2A.

https://openalex.org/W1796504791,"Proteome analysis of complex biological samples for biomarker identification remains challenging, among others due to the extended range of protein concentrations. High-abundance proteins like albumin or IgG of plasma and urine, may interfere with the detection of potential disease biomarkers. Currently, several options are available for the depletion of abundant proteins in plasma. However, the applicability of these methods in urine has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we compared different, commercially available immunodepletion and ion-exchange based approaches on urine samples from both healthy subjects and CKD patients, for their reproducibility and efficiency in protein depletion. A starting urine volume of 500 μL was used to simulate conditions of a multi-institutional biomarker discovery study. All depletion approaches showed satisfactory reproducibility (n=5) in protein identification as well as protein abundance. Comparison of the depletion efficiency between the unfractionated and fractionated samples and the different depletion strategies, showed efficient depletion in all cases, with the exception of the ion-exchange kit. The depletion efficiency was found slightly higher in normal than in CKD samples and normal samples yielded more protein identifications than CKD samples when using both initial as well as corresponding depleted fractions. Along these lines, decrease in the amount of albumin and other targets as applicable, following depletion, was observed. Nevertheless, these depletion strategies did not yield a higher number of identifications in neither the urine from normal nor CKD patients. Collectively, when analyzing urine in the context of CKD biomarker identification, no added value of depletion strategies can be observed and analysis of unfractionated starting urine appears to be preferable."
https://openalex.org/W969034532,"Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) allow users to control devices and communicate by using brain activity only. BCIs based on broad-band visual stimulation can outperform BCIs using other stimulation paradigms. Visual stimulation with pseudo-random bit-sequences evokes specific Broad-Band Visually Evoked Potentials (BBVEPs) that can be reliably used in BCI for high-speed communication in speller applications. In this study, we report a novel paradigm for a BBVEP-based BCI that utilizes a generative framework to predict responses to broad-band stimulation sequences. In this study we designed a BBVEP-based BCI using modulated Gold codes to mark cells in a visual speller BCI. We defined a linear generative model that decomposes full responses into overlapping single-flash responses. These single-flash responses are used to predict responses to novel stimulation sequences, which in turn serve as templates for classification. The linear generative model explains on average 50% and up to 66% of the variance of responses to both seen and unseen sequences. In an online experiment, 12 participants tested a 6 × 6 matrix speller BCI. On average, an online accuracy of 86% was reached with trial lengths of 3.21 seconds. This corresponds to an Information Transfer Rate of 48 bits per minute (approximately 9 symbols per minute). This study indicates the potential to model and predict responses to broad-band stimulation.

During inflammation, HA becomes covalently modified with heavy chains (HC-HA) from inter-α-inhibitor (IαI), which functions to increase its avidity for leukocytes. Our murine model of allergic pulmonary inflammation suggested that HC-HA may contribute to inflammation, adversely effecting lower airway remodeling and asthma severity. Our objective was to characterize the levels of HA and HC-HA in asthmatic subjects and to correlate these levels with asthma severity. We determined the levels and distribution of HA and HC-HA (i) from asthmatic and control lung tissue, (ii) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from non-severe and severe asthmatics and controls, and (iii) in serum and urine from atopic asthmatics after an experimental asthma exacerbation. HC-HA distribution was observed (i) in the thickened basement membrane of asthmatic lower airways, (ii) around smooth muscle cells of the asthmatic submucosa, and (iii) around reserve cells of the asthmatic epithelium. Patients with severe asthma had increased HA levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid that correlated with pulmonary function and nitric oxide levels, whereas HC-HA was only observed in a patient with non-severe asthma. After an experimental asthma exacerbation, serum HA was increased within 4 h after challenge and remained elevated through 5 days after challenge. Urine HA and HC-HA were not significantly different. These data implicate HA and HC-HA in the pathogenesis of asthma severity that may occur in part due to repetitive asthma exacerbations over the course of the disease.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that has increased in prevalence over the past decades. A subset of asthmatics have severe disease characterized by a fixed obstructive component on spirometry and are often on high dose inhaled corticosteroids or chronic oral steroids. The lower airways in these patients are characterized by basement membrane thickening, severe airway smooth muscle hypertrophy, and increased deposition of extracellular matrix (1Elias J.A. Lee C.G.

Indeed, TSG-6 null mice had reduced HA in the lungs after acute exposure, less inflammation, and a reduction in lower airway hyperresponsiveness (14Swaidani S. Cheng G. Lauer M.E. Sharma M. Mikecz K.

Based on these data, we hypothesized that HA and the covalent modification of HA with HCs promote leukocyte adhesion to HA matrices in asthmatic lower airways, promoting chronic inflammation that can result in aberrant remodeling of the lower airways and contributing to asthma severity as a result of repeated asthma exacerbations. To test our hypothesis, we measured HA and HC-HA: (i) distribution in asthmatic lower airways, (ii) levels in BAL fluid of controls, non-severe, and severe asthmatics, and (iii) levels in the serum and urine of asthmatics that underwent an aerosolized whole lung allergen provocation. All recruited subjects gave informed written consent by signing a Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board-approved consent document. All subjects were part of the Cleveland Clinic Severe Asthma Research Program. To qualify, all subjects were screened by history, physical examination, spirometry (before and after 2 puffs of inhaled albuterol), methacholine provocation, and allergy prick skin testing to a standard panel of aeroallergens. All subjects were nonsmokers (<5-packs/year) between ages 18 and 55 yr. Subjects were classified as healthy controls if they were free of respiratory symptoms and had normal baseline spirometry, a negative methacholine challenge test, and negative skin tests. Subjects were classified as allergic asthmatics if they had two or more positive skin tests and met the criteria for asthma. None of the asthmatics had atopic dermatitis/eczema. One asthmatic patient had nasal polyps and chronic sinusitis. Severe asthma was defined by the proceedings of the American Thoracic Society Workshop on Refractory Asthma (16American Thoracic Society Proceedings of the ATS workshop on refractory asthma: current understanding, recommendations, and unanswered questions.Am.

To distinguish nonsevere and severe asthma, we evaluated all individuals with asthma on the basis of severity of airflow limitation, as classified by forced expiratory volume (%FEV1) and FEV1/FVC ratio. BAL fluid was collected from the instillation of three 50-ml aliquots of normal saline solution warmed to 37 °C into the lingula and withdrawn by gentle hand aspiration. Lung tissue for histological and biochemical analysis was procured from endobronchial biopsies during a bronchoscopy with Institutional Review Board approval and from rare large surgical biopsies. Cadaver lung tissue was procured from a patient with acute severe asthma. The tissue for the microscopic and electrophoretic assays was from similar regions in some, but not all, subjects. Spirometry and fractional exhaled NO analyses were done consistent with American Thoracic Society standards and as previously described (18Lara A. Khatri S.B. Wang Z. Comhair S.A. Xu W. Dweik R.A.

Asthmatics with >2-positive skin tests (Allergic asthmatics, group 4) and whose positive skin tests included reactions to either ragweed or grass pollen were selected for this procedure (whole lung allergen challenge (WLAC)). They were exposed to aerosolized whole lung allergen provocation when out of season. Escalating concentrations of allergen were aerosolized to determine the provocative dose, which causes a 20% decline in FEV1 (PD20). For grass pollen challenge, a stock solution of allergen (10,000 bioequivalent allergy units (BAU/ml)) was diluted with saline to produce eight concentrations (1, 3.6, 10, 31.6, 100, 316, 1000, and 3162 BAU/ml) for inhalation. For ragweed pollen challenge, a stock solution of allergen (22 antigen E units/ml) was diluted with saline to produce eight concentrations (0.002, 0.008, 0.02, 0.8, 0.22, 0.7, 2.2, and 7 antigen E units/ml) for inhalation. The patient inhaled five breaths at each concentration range. The concentration of allergen producing a 20% fall in FEV1 was determined. At the end of the challenge, two puffs of inhaled albuterol were administered via a metered dose inhaler. HA was quantified using an HA test kit (Corgenix, Broomfield, CO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The HA test kit uses a capture molecule known as “hyaluronan-binding protein” (HABP). Diluted BAL, serum, and urine samples were incubated in HABP-coated microwells, which allows the HA present in samples to react with the immobilized HABP. After removal of unbound BAL molecules by washing with PBS, HABP conjugated with horseradish peroxidase solution was added to the microwells to form complexes with the immobilized HA. After washing with PBS, a chromogenic substrate of tetramethylbenzidine and hydrogen peroxide was added to develop color reaction. The intensity of the color was measured in absorbance units with a spectrophotometer at 450 nm. HA levels in urine and control samples were determined against a reference curve prepared from the reagent blank and the HA reference solution provided with the kit. For more information on the sensitivity, specificity, and molecular weight accuracy of this technique please consult our review by Haserodt et al. (23Haserodt S. Aytekin M. Dweik R.A.

HA distribution on paraffin sections of healthy control and asthmatic human lung tissue was assessed by probing the sections with a biotinylated HABP (385911; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) used at a 1:100 dilution in PBS containing 1% BSA. A streptavidin horseradish peroxidase construct was then applied following the manufacturer's recommendations for the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Kit, using the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate. De-indentified human lung tissues of asthmatics and control non-asthmatic patients from paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized and blocked for 30 min in PBS with 1% BSA. HA, IαI, and the common leukocyte antigen (CD45) were simultaneously labeled with the following primary antibodies and binding protein in the blocking solution. (i) HA was labeled with a biotinylated hyaluronan binding protein (5 μg/ml; 385911; EMD Millipore), (ii) IαI was labeled with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against IαI (1:100; A0301; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and (iii) CD45 was labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:100; M070; Dako). After a 45-min incubation at room temperature, the slides were washed in PBS 3 times, 10 min each wash. The following secondary antibodies and binding proteins were simultaneously applied in the blocking solution: (i) streptavidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 633 (1:500; S21375; Life Technologies); (ii) Cy3 donkey anti-rabbit (1:400; 711-165-152; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), (iii) donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:250; A21202; Life Technologies). After a-45 min incubation at room temperature, the slides were washed in PBS 3 times, 10 min each wash. Vectashield fluorescent mounting medium with DAPI (H-1200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was applied before placing the coverslip. Imaging was done by confocal (Fig. 2) and standard (Fig. 3) fluorescent microscopy. Grayscale images were pseudocolored using ImageJ software (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, United States National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).FIGURE 3Expression of the heavy chain donor inter-α-inhibitor by reserve cells of the airway epithelium.

In this assay, HA was covalently attached to 8-well strips of a 96-well plate as follows. An aliquot (97.52 μl) of 46 mm Sulfo-NHS (106627-54-7; Thermo Scientific) was added to 5.3 ml of 1700-kDa HA (LifeCore Biomedical, Chaska, MN) at 200 μg/ml in water followed by the addition of 5.3 ml of 1.87 mm of 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (25952-53-8; Thermo Scientific). An aliquot (100 μl/well) was transferred to each well of the 96 wells on a Nunc NH-Covalink plate (Thermo Scientific) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C. The wells were washed twice with 2 m NaCl (200 μl per well) followed by washing with PBS 3 times. Gentamicin in PBS (50 μg/ml) was added to each well (200 μl/well), and the sealed plate was stored at 4 °C. On the day of the assay, the wells of the plate were blocked for 1 h with 100 μl of 5% nonfat milk in PBS and then rinsed 3 times in PBS. To 91 μl of each BAL sample was added 4 μl of a commercial source of human serum (Equitech Bio, Kerrville, TX) and 5 μl of 10 mm MgCl2. Positive controls included the addition of 0.15 μg/ml recombinant human TSG-6 (2104-TS-050; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Negative controls included 4 μl of serum and 5 μl of 10 mm MgCl2 added to 91 μl of PBS. The BAL was incubated on the HA-coated NH-Covalink plates for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 20 mm EDTA to each well. The wells were washed with PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) 3 times, and then an aliquot (100 μl) of a rabbit polyclonal antibody, raised against IαI, (diluted 1:1000 in Li-Cor blocking buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20), was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed 3 times with PBST followed by the addition of 100 μl of an infrared anti-rabbit secondary antibody from Li-Cor diluted 1:2000 in Li-Cor blocker containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The wells were washed three times in PBST followed by imaging on a Li-Cor Odyssey CLx infrared scanner. This method has been previously described and is presented here with minor changes (25Lauer M.E. Loftis J. de la Motte C. Hascall V.C.

Human lung tissue from a patient who died from acute severe asthma was cut with a scalpel and transferred to a preweighed 1.5-ml tube that was prechilled on dry ice. The weight of the lung tissue was recorded, and pre-chilled PBS was added to the tubes such that 100 μl of cold PBS was added for every 30 mg of tissue. The tissue was minced with scissors, on ice, in PBS for ∼1 min. A 50-μl aliquot of the minced tissue suspension was transferred to four new prechilled 1.5-ml new tubes. To each of these four tubes was added (i) PBS (10 μl), (ii) Streptomyces hyaluronidase (10 μl of a 0.5 TRU/ml stock; 389561-100U, EMD Millipore), (iii) an HA oligosaccharide 14 monosaccharides in length (2 μl of a 1 mg/ml stock; Seikagaku) with 8 μl PBS, and (iv) HA14 (same as tube 3) and recombinant TSG-6 (2 μl of a 0.250 μg/ml stock; R&D Systems). Tubes 1 and 2 were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 13,200 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatants were transferred to new prechilled 1.5-ml tubes and incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C. Tubes 3 and 4 were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and centrifuged at 13,200 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. Then 25 μl of each supernatant was added per lane on 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio-Rad) and blotted using the Bio-Rad nitrocellulose and Trans-Blot Turbo System. The blot was blocked for 1 h with Li-Cor blocking buffer (927-40000; Li-Cor) and then probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against IαI (A0301, Dako North America, Inc. Carpinteria, CA, 1:8000 dilution). The secondary antibody was IRDYE anti-rabbit 800CW (926-32211, Li-Cor) used at 1:15,000. The blot was washed and imaged on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor). The method used to measure HC-HA in BAL fluid was similar. An aliquot (2.5 μl) of Streptomyces hyaluronidase (0.5 TRU/ml) or PBS as a negative control was added to 25 μl of BAL fluid and incubated on ice for 30 min followed by a second incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were then analyzed by Western blot, as described above for the lung tissue HC-HA. Quantitative data were summarized as the means ± S.E. unless otherwise noted; categorical data were summarized by frequencies. Two-tailed t test statistics and analysis of variance were used when appropriate. Although the presence of HA in the pulmonary secretions (26Vignola A.M. Chanez P. Campbell A.M. Souques F. Lebel B.

To address this we probed paraffin blocks of healthy control and asthmatic lung tissue with a biotinylated HABP using standard IHC methods (Fig. 1; n = 6 for healthy controls and n = 3 for asthmatics). HA was observed in the thickened basement membrane and surrounding the smooth muscle cells of the airway submucosa in asthmatic tissue, although it was comparably absent in the mucus and goblet cells of the airway epithelium. HA was also found in the basement membrane and the airway submucosa of control subjects, albeit to a much lesser extent considering the lack of the smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and basement membrane thickening in the control tissue. In Fig. 2 we examined the distribution of IαI (indicative of the covalent HC modification of HA) with HA in asthmatic and healthy control lung tissue (n = 6 for healthy controls and n = 3 for asthmatics). Colocalization by immunofluorescent microscopy of HA (HABP) with an antibody against IαI was observed in the thickened basement membrane around asthmatic airways but not within the basement membranes of non-asthmatic airways. This colocalization was also observed around smooth muscle cells in the airway submucosa of asthmatic, but not control, tissue rather than in the airway epithelium where HA and IαI levels were minimal. The colocalization was observed in the matrix surrounding the smooth muscle cell myofibrils rather than in the myofibrils themselves. Although the airway epithelium staining was essentially negative for HA, HC-HA, and IαI, regions of “reserve” epithelial cells stained positive for IαI (Fig. 3; n = 3), suggesting that these cells might secrete their own HC donor for use in the remodeling of the damaged epithelium by this cell population (Fig. 3). Although the co-localization of IαI with HA is not sufficient proof that the HA in these regions is covalently modified with HCs (that will be demonstrated later in the manuscript), the striking colocalization is at least suggestive that the HC modification of HA may be in these regions. We used immunofluorescent microscopy to examine the distribution of leukocytes within HC-HA matrices in lung tissue from a patient with acute severe asthma (Fig. 4; n = 3). As apparent in the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and trichrome stains (Fig. 4, E and F), the airways of this patient displayed significant smooth muscle proliferation, epithelial metaplasia, and mucus gland hypertrophy, including airway obstruction by a significant mucus plug. HA was distributed throughout the submucosa region and distributed around, but not within, serous mucus glands (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, HA was largely absent within the mucus of the airway lumen. IαI (i.e. HC) distribution was almost exclusively present in the submucosa region, displaying a striking colocalization with HA indicative of pathological HC-HA matrices (Fig. 4B).

https://openalex.org/W1454727810,"Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) is a common otologic emergency whose cause is still unclear. The importance of blood lipids in the pathogenesis of ISSHL is widely reported in literature. In fact elevated levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), total cholesterol (TC) and apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) have been proposed as risk factors for this pathology. No correlation has been described between serum lipid parameters and the prognosis of ISSHL. Aim of the present study was to identify prognostic factors associated with hearing recovery in a group of patients affected by ISSHL. Ninety-four patients with the diagnosis of ISSHL hospitalized between March 2013 and October 2014 were included in this study. Patients’ blood sampling and hearing assessments were carried out. Patients were divided into two groups as “recovered” and “unrecovered”, according to their response to the treatment. We found a statistically significant higher level of total cholesterol in the unrecovered group compared to the recovered one (p = 0.03). None of the other routine laboratory parameters have shown a statistically significant difference between the patients successfully treated and patients with poor outcomes. Total cholesterol concentrations may be a prognostic factor for recovery in ISSHL and should be assessed together with routine tests in patients with this condition. The other routine laboratory parameters seem to have no effect on the development and prognosis of this pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1563080703,"The p21-activated kinase 5 (PAK5) is overexpressed in advanced cancer and the transcription factor E47 is a direct repressor of E-cadherin and inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the relationship between PAK5 and E47 has not been explored. In this study, we found that PAK5-mediated E47 phosphorylation promoted EMT in advanced colon cancer. PAK5 interacted with E47 and phosphorylated E47 on Ser39 under hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation, which decreased cell-cell cohesion, increased cell migration and invasion in vitro and promoted metastasis in a xenograft model. Furthermore, phosphorylation of E47 facilitated its accumulating in nucleus in an importin α-dependent manner, and enhanced E47 binding to E-cadherin promoter directly, leading to inhibition of E-cadherin transcription. In contrast, PAK5-knockdown resulted in blockage of HGF-induced E47 phosphorylation, attenuated association of E47 with importin α and decreased E47 binding to E-cadherin promoter. In addition, we demonstrated a close correlation between PAK5 and phospho-Ser39 E47 expression in colon cancer specimens. More importantly, high expression of phospho-E47 was associated with an aggressive phenotype of colon cancer and nuclear phospho-E47 staining was found in certain cases of colon cancer with metastasis. Collectively, E47 is a novel substrate of PAK5, and PAK5-mediated phosphorylation of E47 promotes EMT and metastasis of colon cancer, suggesting that phosphorylated E47 on Ser39 may be a potential therapeutic target in progressive colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1759855952,"Background The placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has become routine practice to protect high risk patients from sudden cardiac death. However, implantation-related myocardial micro-damage and its relation to different implantation strategies are poorly characterized. Methods A total of 194 ICD recipients (64±12 years, 83% male, 95% primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, 35% cardiac resynchronization therapy) were randomly assigned to one of three implantation strategies: (1) ICD implantation without any defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing, (2) estimation of the DFT without arrhythmia induction (modified “upper limit of vulnerability (ULV) testing”) or (3) traditional safety margin testing including ventricular arrhythmia induction. High-sensitive Troponin T (hsTnT) levels were determined prior to the implantation and 6 hours after. Results All three groups showed a postoperative increase of hsTnT. The mean delta was 0.031±0.032 ng/ml for patients without DFT testing, 0.080±0.067 ng/ml for the modified ULV-testing and 0.064±0.056 ng/ml for patients with traditional safety margin testing. Delta hsTnT was significantly larger in both of the groups with intraoperative ICD testing compared to the non-testing strategy (p≤0.001 each). There was no statistical difference in delta hsTnT between the two groups with intraoperative ICD testing (p = 0.179). Conclusion High-sensitive Troponin T release during ICD implantation is significantly higher in patients with intraoperative ICD testing using shock applications compared to those without testing. Shock applications, with or without arrhythmia induction, did not result in a significantly different delta hsTnT. Hence, the ICD shock itself and not ventricular fibrillation seems to cause myocardial micro-damage. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01230086"
https://openalex.org/W1707320767,"Mover, a member of the exquisitely small group of vertebrate-specific presynaptic proteins, has been discovered as an interaction partner of the scaffolding protein Bassoon, yet its function has not been elucidated. We used adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated shRNA expression to knock down Mover in the calyx of Held in vivo. Although spontaneous synaptic transmission remained unaffected, we found a strong increase of the evoked EPSC amplitude. The size of the readily releasable pool was unaltered, but short-term depression was accelerated and enhanced, consistent with an increase in release probability after Mover knockdown. This increase in release probability was not caused by alterations in Ca2+ influx but rather by a higher Ca2+ sensitivity of the release machinery, as demonstrated by presynaptic Ca2+ uncaging. We therefore conclude that Mover expression in certain subsets of synapses negatively regulates synaptic release probability, constituting a novel mechanism to tune synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W938949745,"Aims Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) leads to extensive vascular remodeling and is important cause of visual impairment. Although the vascular morphological changes following experimental vein occlusion have been described in a variety of models using angiography, the underlying cellular events are ill defined. Methods and Results We here show that laser-induced experimental BRVO in mice leads to a wave of TUNEL-positive endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis in the upstream vascular network associated with a transient edema and hemorrhages. Subsequently, we observe an induction of EC proliferation within the dilated vein and capillaries, detected by EdU incorporation, and the edema resolves. However, the pericytes of the upstream capillaries are severely reduced, which was associated with continuing EC apoptosis and proliferation. The vascular remodeling was associated with increased expression of TGFβ, TSP-1, but also FGF2 expression. Exposure of the experimental animals to hypoxia, when pericyte (PC) dropout had occurred, led to a dramatic increase in endothelial cell proliferation, confirming the vascular instability induced by the experimental BRVO. Conclusion Experimental BRVO leads to acute endothelial cells apoptosis and increased permeability. Subsequently the upstream vascular network remains destabilized, characterized by pericyte dropout, un-physiologically high endothelial cells turnover and sensitivity to hypoxia. These early changes might pave the way for capillary loss and subsequent chronic ischemia and edema that characterize the late stage disease."
https://openalex.org/W948946966,"Selection of NSCLC patients for targeted therapy is currently based upon the presence of sensitizing mutations in EGFR and EML4/ALK translocations. The heterogeneity of molecular alterations in lung cancer has led to the ongoing discovery of potential biomarkers and targets in order to improve survival.This study aimed to detect alterations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, MET-gene copy number and ALK rearrangements in a large cohort of 956 NSCLC patients of Hellenic origin using highly sensitive techniques and correlations with clinicopathological characteristics.Mutations were detected in EGFR 10.6% (101 out of 956 samples), KRAS 26.5% (191 out of 720 samples), BRAF 2.5% (12 out of 471 samples), PIK3CA 3.8% (7 out of 184 samples), MET gene amplification was detected in 18% (31 out of 170) and ALK rearrangements in 3.7% (4 out of 107 samples). EGFR mutations were detected in exon 19 (61.4% of mutant cases), exon 21 p.Leu858Arg (19.8%), exon 20 (15.8%), exon 18 (2.9%) and were correlated with gender histology, smoking status and TTF1 staining. p.Thr790Met mutant cases (3.9%) displayed concurrent mutations in exons 19 or 21. Negative TTF-1 staining showed strong negative predictive value for the presence of EGFR mutations. KRAS mutations were associated with histology, the most common mutation being p.Gly12Cys (38%).In conclusion, only 89 patients were eligible for EGFR -TKIs and ALK inhibitors therapy, whereas 257 patients showed other alterations, highlighting the necessity for a detailed molecular profiling potentially leading to more efficient individualized therapies for NSCLC patients."

When dealing with data from various sources, it is crucial that these tools are robust for many different imaging protocols. In this study, we tested the robustness of a multiple-atlas, likelihood fusion algorithm using Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data with six different protocols, comprising three manufacturers and two magnetic field strengths. The entire brain was parceled into five different levels of granularity. In each level, which defines a set of brain structures, ranging from eight to 286 regions, we evaluated the variability of brain volumes related to the protocol, age, and diagnosis (healthy or Alzheimer’s disease). Our results indicated that, with proper pre-processing steps, the impact of different protocols is minor compared to biological effects, such as age and pathology. A precise knowledge of the sources of data variation enables sufficient statistical power and ensures the reliability of an anatomical analysis when using this automated brain parcellation tool on datasets from various imaging protocols, such as clinical databases."

CD4+ T-cell count <350 cells/μL while at least two years on cART or CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/μL while at least one year on cART, and 2. viral suppression for at least the previous 6 months. HIV-infected patients were randomized to add maraviroc (41 patients) or placebo (44 patients) to their cART regimen for 48 weeks.

https://openalex.org/W948260640,"Diagnostic and prognostic indicators are key components to achieve the goal of personalized cancer therapy. Two distinct approaches to this goal include predicting response by genetic analysis and direct testing of possible therapies using cultures derived from biopsy specimens. Optimally, the latter method requires a rapid assessment, but growing xenograft tumors or developing patient-derived cell lines can involve a great deal of time and expense. Furthermore, tumor cells have much different responses when grown in 2D versus 3D tissue environments. Using a modification of existing methods, we show that it is possible to make tumor-fragment (TF) spheroids in only 2–3 days. TF spheroids appear to closely model characteristics of the original tumor and may be used to assess critical therapy-modulating features of the microenvironment such as hypoxia. A similar method allows the reproducible development of spheroids from mixed tumor cells and fibroblasts (mixed-cell spheroids). Prior literature reports have shown highly variable development and properties of mixed-cell spheroids and this has hampered the detailed study of how individual tumor-cell components interact. In this study, we illustrate this approach and describe similarities and differences using two tumor models (U87 glioma and SQ20B squamous-cell carcinoma) with supporting data from additional cell lines. We show that U87 and SQ20B spheroids predict a key microenvironmental factor in tumors (hypoxia) and that SQ20B cells and spheroids generate similar numbers of microvesicles. We also present pilot data for miRNA expression under conditions of cells, tumors, and TF spheroids."
https://openalex.org/W1808881593,"In the absence of extracellular stimulation the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound protein (Grb2) and the phospholipase Plcγ1 compete for the same binding site on fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). Reducing cellular Grb2 results in upregulation of Plcγ1 and depletion of the phospholipid PI(4,5)P2. The functional consequences of this event on signaling pathways are unknown. We show that the decrease in PI(4,5)P2 level under non-stimulated conditions inhibits PTEN activity leading to the aberrant activation of the oncoprotein Akt. This results in excessive cell proliferation and tumor progression in a xenograft mouse model. As well as defining a novel mechanism of Akt phosphorylation with important therapeutic consequences, we also demonstrate that differential expression levels of FGFR2, Plcγ1 and Grb2 correlate with patient survival. Oncogenesis through fluctuation in the expression levels of these proteins negates extracellular stimulation or mutation and defines them as novel prognostic markers in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2164068019,"Background The polymorphisms of α-synuclein (SNCA), rs3775444, rs3822086 and rs11931074 that are strongly associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) in Caucasian populations, were examined in this study to elucidate the role of polymorphisms in different ethnic backgrounds. The possible associations of these three polymorphisms were also investigated in PD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) in a Chinese population based on the overlapping of clinical manifestations and pathological characteristics of these three neurodegenerative diseases. Methods A total of 1276 PD, 885 sporadic ALS (SALS), 364 MSA patients, and 846 healthy controls (HCs) were included. All subjects were genotyped for the three polymorphisms using Sequenom iPLEX Assay technology. Results Significant differences in the genotype distributions (p = 5.99E-06 and p = 4.98E-06, respectively) and the minor allele frequency (MAF) (p = 2.16E-06 and p = 2.15E-06, respectively) of SNCA rs3822086 (C) and rs11931074 (G) were observed between PD and HCs. However, no differences were found in the genotype distributions and MAF of SNCA rs3775444 (T) between PD and HCs. Haplotype that incorporated the three SNPs further strengthened the association with PD (best haplotype, p = 9.62E-005). No significant differences in the genotype distributions and MAF of the SNPs were found between SALS and HCs, MSA and HCs, and subgroups of PD and SALS. However, the MAF of SNCA rs3775444 (T) was significantly higher in MSA patients with frontal lobe dysfunction than MSA patients without dysfunction (p = 0.0002, OR 2.53, 95%CI: 1.55-4.15). Conclusion Our results suggest that the rs3822086 (C) allele and rs11931074 (G) allele in SNCA decrease the risk for PD, and SNCA rs11931074 may affect frontal lobe dysfunction of MSA in the Chinese population. However, these SNCA polymorphisms are not likely a common cause of SALS or MSA."
https://openalex.org/W986312038,"Accumulating evidence reveals the effectiveness of epigenetic therapy in gastric cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms and targets underlying such therapeutic responses remain elusive. Herein, we report an aberrant yet therapeutically rectifiable epigenetic signaling in gastric carcinogenesis. Administration of DNA-demethylating drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) reduced gastric cancer incidence by ~74% (P < 0.05) in N-nitroso-N-methylurea-treated mice. Through genome-wide methylation scanning, novel promoter hypermethylation-silenced and drug-targeted genes were identified in the resected murine stomach tumors and tissues. We uncovered that growth/differentiation factor 1 (Gdf1), a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, was silenced by promoter hypermethylation in control tumor-bearing mice, but became reactivated in 5-aza-dC-treated mice (P < 0.05). In parallel, the downregulated SMAD2/3 phosphorylation in gastric cancer was revived by 5-aza-dC in vivo. Such hypermethylation-dependent silencing and 5-aza-dC-mediated reactivation of GDF1-SMAD2/3 activity was conserved in human gastric cancer cells (P < 0.05). Subsequent functional characterization further revealed the antiproliferative activity of GDF1, which was exerted through activation of SMAD2/3/4-mediated signaling, transcriptional controls on p15, p21 and c-Myc cell-cycle regulators and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. Clinically, hypermethylation and loss of GDF1 was significantly associated with reduced phosphorylated-SMAD2/3 and poor survival in stomach cancer patients (P < 0.05). Taken together, we demonstrated a causal relationship between DNA methylation and a tumor-suppressive pathway in gastric cancer. Epigenetic silencing of GDF1 abrogates the growth-inhibitory SMAD signaling and renders proliferation advantage to gastric epithelial cells during carcinogenesis. This study lends support to epigenetic therapy for gastric cancer chemoprevention and identifies a potential biomarker for prognosis."

It is not known how Mule is activated by TNF. Here we report that TNF activates Mule by inducing the dissociation of Mule from its inhibitor ARF. ARF binds to and thereby inhibits the E3 ligase activity of Mule in the steady state. TNF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Mule, which subsequently dissociates from ARF and becomes activated. Inhibition of Mule phosphorylation by silencing of the Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (Syk) prevents its dissociation from ARF, thereby inhibiting Mule E3 ligase activity and TNF-induced JNK activation and cell death.

https://openalex.org/W1634502718,"The genus Cyclopia, an indigenous South African fynbos plant used to prepare honeybush tea, contains phytoestrogenic compounds. An extract from C. subternata, SM6Met, displays three desirable estrogenic attributes for future development of a phytoestrogenic nutraceutical, namely, ERα antagonism, ERβ agonism, and also antagonism of E2-induced breast cancer cell proliferation. Activity-guided fractionation of SM6Met was used in an attempt to isolate and identify compounds conferring the desirable estrogenic profile to SM6Met. Initial liquid-liquid fractionation of SM6Met yielded a polar fraction (PF) and a non-polar fraction (NPF), with the desirable estrogenic attributes retained in the NPF. Subsequent high performance counter-current chromatography (HPCCC) fractionation of the NPF yielded three fractions (F1-F3). Interestingly, the fractions revealed separation of the previously demonstrated positive estrogenic attributes of the NPF into separate fractions, with F1 and F2 acting as ERα antagonists, only F2 inducing antagonism of E2-induced breast cancer cell proliferation and only F3 retaining robust ERβ agonist activity. In terms of major polyphenols, quantitative HPLC and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) indicated that HPCCC fractionation resulted in a divergence of polyphenolic classes, with F1 emerging as the dihydrochalcone-rich fraction and F2 as the flavanone- and benzophenone-rich fraction, while the xanthones, flavones and phenolic acids were retained in F3. F3 was re-engineered into F3R by reassembling the major polyphenols identified in the fraction. F3R could, however, not replicate the effect of F3. In conclusion, although activity-guided fractionation results suggest that retention of all the desirable estrogenic attributes of the original SM6Met in one fraction is not an attainable goal, fractionation is a useful tool to enhance specific desirable estrogenic attributes."

Data relating to the symptoms, signs, disease history, biochemical testing, cardiac electrophysiology, imaging detection, treatment and outcome were collected and the gender differences were analyzed. We found that embolisms occurred significantly more frequently in the right lung (89.7%) than in the left lung (42.6%). The presence of dyspnea, the number of patients presenting with tumors, the number of patients with chronic pulmonary disease, those with emboli in the right pulmonary artery and emboli in the right lung, as well as the average systolic and diastolic blood pressure were: 78.1%, 15.1%, 31.5%, 32.9%, 94.5%, 129.9+20.0 and 75.0+11.2 in the male patients and 59.2%, 1.3%, 14.5%, 17.1%, 69.7%, 125.1+14.6 and 69.3+11.0 in the female patients. These indicators were found to be significantly higher in male patients. In contrast, the rate of V1-V4 T-wave inversion and level of D-dimer in the blood were significantly lower in males than in females. No significant difference was observed in the remaining observational indicators. Gender differences regarding the symptoms, signs, disease history, lesion position and pathophysiology exist in patients with PE and should be considered in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W956994017,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that regulate chemical transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Structural information is available at low resolution from open and closed forms of an eukaryotic receptor, and at high resolution from other members of the same structural family, two prokaryotic orthologs and an eukaryotic GluCl channel. Structures of human channels however are still lacking. Homology modeling and Molecular Dynamics simulations are valuable tools to predict structures of unknown proteins, however, for the case of human nAchRs, they have been unsuccessful in providing a stable open structure so far. This is due to different problems with the template structures: on one side the homology with prokaryotic species is too low, while on the other the open eukaryotic GluCl proved itself unstable in several MD studies and collapsed to a dehydrated, non-conductive conformation, even when bound to an agonist. Aim of this work is to obtain, by a mixing of state-of-the-art homology and simulation techniques, a plausible prediction of the structure (still unknown) of the open state of human α7 nAChR complexed with epibatidine, from which it is possible to start structural and functional test studies. To prevent channel closure we employ a restraint that keeps the transmembrane pore open, and obtain in this way a stable, hydrated conformation. To further validate this conformation, we run four long, unbiased simulations starting from configurations chosen at random along the restrained trajectory. The channel remains stable and hydrated over the whole runs. This allows to assess the stability of the putative open conformation over a cumulative time of 1 μs, 800 ns of which are of unbiased simulation. Mostly based on the analysis of pore hydration and size, we suggest that the obtained structure has reasonable chances to be (at least one of the possible) structures of the channel in the open conformation."

However, disease spots usually appear after the flowering of the plant and may result in the withering of the plant in severe cases. This study examined the disease incidence in an herbaceous peony field in the Yangzhou region, Jiangsu Province. Based on morphological characteristics and molecular data, the disease in this area was identified as a gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea. Based on previously obtained transcriptome data, eight libraries generated from two herbaceous peony cultivars ‘Zifengyu’ and ‘Dafugui’ with different susceptibilities to the disease were then analyzed using digital gene expression profiling (DGE). Thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by comparing the eight samples, and these genes were annotated using the Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) database. The pathways related to plant-pathogen interaction, secondary metabolism synthesis and antioxidant system were concentrated, and 51, 76, and 13 disease resistance-relevant candidate genes were identified, respectively. The expression patterns of these candidate genes differed between the two cultivars: their expression of the disease-resistant cultivar ‘Zifengyu’ sharply increased during the early stages of infection, while it was relatively subdued in the disease-sensitive cultivar ‘Dafugui’. A selection of ten candidate genes was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to validate the DGE data. These results revealed the transcriptional changes that took place during the interaction of herbaceous peony with B. cinerea, providing insight into the molecular mechanisms of host resistance to gray mold."

DPPs belong to the prolyl oligopeptidase subfamily of the serine protease family and contain a well known catalytic triad (Ser/His/Asp). However, DPP6 (also known as DPPX) and DPP10 (DPPY) lack the catalytic serine (it is substituted to aspartic acid in DPP6 or glycine in DPP10) and hence lack catalytic activity (18Maffie J. Rudy B.

Therefore, the Kv4-KChIP-DPP complex could be a good target for therapeutic approaches to these diseases, although a better understanding of the complex composition and formation would be required. DPP increases the current amplitude of Kv4 both by increasing the single-channel conductance and by facilitating the trafficking of Kv4 protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (38Zagha E.

DPP also accelerates both the inactivation and the recovery from inactivation of Kv4, although the underlying mechanism has not been fully determined (42Jerng H.H. Qian Y. Pfaffinger P.J.

A novel N-terminal motif of dipeptidyl peptidase-like proteins produces rapid inactivation of KV4.2 channels by a pore-blocking mechanism.Channels (Austin). 2009; 3: 448-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The region from the N terminus to the start of the transmembrane domain of DPP10 plays an important role in binding to the S1-S2 segments of Kv4 in complex formation (47Ren X. Hayashi Y. Yoshimura N. Takimoto K. Transmembrane interaction mediates complex formation between peptidase homologues and Kv4 channels.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, it remains uncertain how many DPP subunits can bind to a tetrameric Kv4 channel. Although there is no available crystal structure for the Kv4-DPP complex, a crystal structure of the extracellular domains of DPP6/10 has been determined, and it is suggested that DPP6 and DPP10 exist as a dimer in the plasma membrane (26Strop P. Bankovich A.J. Hansen K.C. Garcia K.C. Brunger A.T. Structure of a human A-type potassium channel interacting protein DPPX, a member of the dipeptidyl aminopeptidase family.J. Mol.

Structure of human dipeptidyl peptidase 10 (DPPY): a modulator of neuronal Kv4 channels.Sci. Rep. 2015; 58769 Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This implies the possibility that Kv4 and DPP preferentially form a 4:2 (Kv4:DPP) channel. On the other hand, a previous experiment using tandem repeat constructs suggests that the Kv4.2 channel requires four DPP6 subunits to be fully modulated (49Soh H. Goldstein S.A. I SA channel complexes include four subunits each of DPP6 and Kv4.2.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15072-15077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We reported previously that the stoichiometry of Kv4 and another accessory subunit, KChIP, is variable and concluded that up to four KChIP molecules can bind to a single Kv4 tetramer (4:4 stoichiometry) (50Kitazawa M. Kubo Y. Nakajo K. The stoichiometry and biophysical properties of the Kv4 potassium channel complex with K+ channel-interacting protein (KChIP) subunits are variable, depending on the relative expression level.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 17597-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of Kv4-KChIP is dependent on the relative expression levels of KChIP and Kv4 with no preferred stoichiometry (50Kitazawa M. Kubo Y. Nakajo K. The stoichiometry and biophysical properties of the Kv4 potassium channel complex with K+ channel-interacting protein (KChIP) subunits are variable, depending on the relative expression level.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 17597-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study, we aimed to determine the stoichiometry of Kv4 and DPP10. We first examined how the expression level of DPP10 affects the electrophysiological properties of Kv4.2 and observed that the current amplitude and the recovery from inactivation changed depending on the expression level of DPP10. Next, we confirmed the dimeric structure of DPP10 alone in the plasma membrane by subunit counting using single-molecule imaging under total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Interestingly, ∼70% of DPP10 on the plasma membrane existed as dimers and the rest existed as monomers. Finally, we determined the stoichiometry of the Kv4.2-DPP10 complex. The stoichiometry of the Kv4.2-DPP10 complex was again variable and dependent on the expression level of DPP10 as is the case for the Kv4-KChIP complex (50Kitazawa M. Kubo Y. Nakajo K. The stoichiometry and biophysical properties of the Kv4 potassium channel complex with K+ channel-interacting protein (KChIP) subunits are variable, depending on the relative expression level.J.

However, in contrast, Kv4.2-DPP10 showed a clear preference for the 4:2 stoichiometry, probably because of the large dimeric extracellular domain.

For mEGFP-DPP10, a XhoI site was added to the N terminus of DPP10, and a cleavage was made at the unique BstXI site in DPP10 (XhoI-DPP10-BstXI). mEGFP with a flexible GGS linker on the C terminus was cleaved at the unique XhoI site in the linker, and cleavage was made at the unique KpnI site in the pGEMHE vector (KpnI-mEGFP-linker-XhoI). The two fragments were ligated at the XhoI sites and inserted into the KpnI and BstXI sites in the DPP10-pGEMHE construct. A C-terminal truncated version of mEGFP-DPP10 (mEGFP-DPP10-D-Extra) was made by PCR as described previously (41Lin L. Long L.K. Hatch M.M. Hoffman D.A.

To construct Kv4.2-mCherry, a BglII site was introduced into the N terminus of mCherry with a flexible GGS linker (BglII-mCherry). mEGFP in Kv4.2-mEGFP was then replaced with mCherry by using the BglII site. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. cRNA was transcribed from the linearized plasmid cDNA using a T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). Oocytes were surgically obtained from Xenopus laevis anesthetized in water containing 0.15% tricaine for 30 min. Xenopus frogs were allowed to recover from anesthesia before being returned to the tank. To remove the follicular cell layer, oocytes were treated with collagenase for 6–7 h at room temperature. Defolliculated oocytes of similar size at stage V or VI were microinjected with 50 nl of cRNA solution and incubated for 1–3 days at 17 °C in frog Ringer solution containing (in mm): 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.3 Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 CaCl2, and 0.82 MgSO4, pH 7.6, with 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Sigma-Aldrich). All experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the National Institute for Physiological Sciences (Japan) and were performed following the institutional guidelines. One to 3 days after cRNA injection, ionic currents were recorded under two-electrode voltage clamp with an OC-725C amplifier (Warner Instruments) at room temperature. The bath chamber was perfused with ND-96 containing (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.2.

Holding potential was −80 mV or −100 mV. Voltage clamp protocols and data acquisition were performed using a digital converter (Digidata 1440) and pCLAMP 10.3 software (Molecular Devices).

To remove the vitelline membrane, oocytes were put into 2× frog Ringer solution, which makes them shrink osmotically. The vitelline membrane was then manually removed with forceps. The oocytes were put on a high refractive index coverslip (n = 1.78) (Olympus) and observed through an objective lens (Olympus ×100, N.A. 1.65) mounted on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX71). Movies of 400 frames (20 Hz, 20 s) were recorded with an iXon3 EMCCD camera (Andor) and Solis software (Andor). ND-96 was used as the extracellular solution. mEGFP was excited with a cyan 488-nm solid laser (Spectra-Physics), and mCherry was excited with an orange 588-nm solid laser (Coherent Inc.). The density of the ion channels was kept low enough (∼1 spot/μm2) to minimize the probability of two spots overlapping within a diffraction-limited spot (52Ulbrich M.H. Isacoff E.Y.

We have identified a novel pathway that directs Lyn/Src family tyrosine kinase signals to the invadopodia to regulate sarcoma cell invasion via the molecule AFAP-1-like-1 (AFAP1L1), a new member of the AFAP (actin filament-associated protein) family. We show that AFAP1L1 can transform cells, promote migration and co-expression with active Lyn profoundly influences cell morphology and movement. AFAP1L1 intersects several invadopodia pathway components through its multiple domains and motifs, including the following (i) pleckstrin homology domains that bind phospholipids generated at the plasma membrane by phosphoinositide 3-kinase, (ii) a direct filamentous-actin binding domain and (iii) phospho-tyrosine motifs (pY136 and pY566) that specifically bind Vav2 and Nck2 SH2 domains, respectively. These phosphotyrosine motifs are essential for AFAP1L1-mediated cytoskeleton regulation. Through its interaction with Vav2, AFAP1L1 regulates Rac activity and downstream control of PAK1/2/3 (p21-activated kinases) phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) kinase and MLC2. AFAP1L1 interaction with Nck2 recruits actin-nucleating complexes. Significantly, in osteosarcoma cell lines, knockdown of AFAP1L1 inhibits phosphorylated MLC2 recruitment to filamentous-actin structures, disrupts invadopodia formation, cell attachment, migration and invasion. These data define a novel pathway that directs Lyn/Src family tyrosine kinase signals to sarcoma cell invadopodia through specific recruitment of Vav2 and Nck2 to phosphorylated AFAP1L1, to control cell migration and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1885579298,"The proteasome is an essential proteolytic machine in eukaryotic cells, where it removes damaged proteins and regulates many cellular activities by degrading ubiquitinated proteins. Its heterohexameric AAA+ ATPase Rpt subunits play a central role in proteasome activity by the engagement of substrate unfolding and translocation for degradation; however, its detailed mechanism remains poorly understood. In contrast to AAA+ ATPase domains, their N-terminal regions of Rpt subunits substantially differ from each other. Here, to investigate the requirements and roles of the N-terminal regions of six Rpt subunits derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we performed systematic mutational analysis using conditional knockdown yeast strains for each Rpt subunit and bacterial heterologous expression system of the base subcomplex. We showed that the formation of the coiled-coil structure was the most important for the N-terminal region of Rpt subunits. The primary role of coiled-coil structure would be the maintenance of the ring structure with the defined order. However, the coiled-coil region would be also be involved in substrate recognition and an interaction between lid and base subcomplexes."
https://openalex.org/W986500637,"Wnt signaling controls various aspects of developmental and cell biology, as well as contributing to certain cancers. Expression of the human Rho family small GTPase Wrch/RhoU is regulated by Wnt signaling, and Wrch and its paralog Chp/RhoV are both implicated in oncogenic transformation and regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. We performed developmental genetic analysis of the single Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of Chp and Wrch, CHW-1. Using a transgenic assay of the distal tip cell migration, we found that wild-type CHW-1 is likely to be partially constitutively active and that we can alter ectopic CHW-1-dependent migration phenotypes with mutations predicted to increase or decrease intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate. The vulval P7.p polarity decision balances multiple antagonistic Wnt signals, and also uses different types of Wnt signaling. Previously described cooperative Wnt receptors LIN-17/Frizzled and LIN-18/Ryk orient P7.p posteriorly, with LIN-17/Fz contributing approximately two-thirds of polarizing activity. CHW-1 deletion appears to equalize the contributions of these two receptors. We hypothesize that CHW-1 increases LIN-17/Fz activity at the expense of LIN-18/Ryk, thus making the contribution of these signals unequal. For P7.p to polarize correctly and form a proper vulva, LIN-17/Fz and LIN-18/Ryk antagonize other Wnt transmembrane systems VANG-1/VanGogh and CAM-1/Ror. Our genetic data suggest that LIN-17/Fz represses both VANG-1/VanGogh and CAM-1/Ror, while LIN-18/Ryk represses only VANG-1. These data expand our knowledge of a sophisticated signaling network to control P7.p polarity, and suggests that CHW-1 can alter ligand gradients or receptor priorities in the system."
https://openalex.org/W1486351043,"Ionizing radiation causes degeneration of myelin, the insulating sheaths of neuronal axons, leading to neurological impairment. As radiation research on the central nervous system has predominantly focused on neurons, with few studies addressing the role of glial cells, we have focused our present research on identifying the latent effects of single/ fractionated -low dose of low/ high energy radiation on the role of base excision repair protein Apurinic Endonuclease-1, in the rat spinal cords oligodendrocyte progenitor cells’ differentiation. Apurinic endonuclease-1 is predominantly upregulated in response to oxidative stress by low- energy radiation, and previous studies show significant induction of Apurinic Endonuclease-1 in neurons and astrocytes. Our studies show for the first time, that fractionation of protons cause latent damage to spinal cord architecture while fractionation of HZE (28Si) induce increase in APE1 with single dose, which then decreased with fractionation. The oligodendrocyte progenitor cells differentiation was skewed with increase in immature oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, which likely cause the observed decrease in white matter, increased neuro-inflammation, together leading to the observed significant cognitive defects."
https://openalex.org/W1522139851,"Introduction Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease in which cytokines play a pivotal role in the induction and maintenance of inflammation. Innate cytokine production is genetically determined and varies largely between individuals; this might impact the severity of inflammation. We aimed to assess whether ex-vivo endotoxin-stimulated levels of cytokines could be associated with disease phenotype. Methods Patients with quiescent CD (Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≤ 4 and negative inflammation markers) who were not using immunomodulating drugs or biologicals were eligible. Historical disease characteristics (localization, behavior, number of bowel resections, drug history, extra-intestinal symptoms) were extracted from medical records. We measured cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-10) in supernatants of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated whole blood cultures and correlated these with disease characteristics and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In addition, we analyzed whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the TNF-α gene were related to TNF-α levels. Results We included 75 patients with CD and 24 healthy controls. Six patients were excluded because of increased inflammation markers resulting in a total of 69 patients. The mean age (SD) of patients with CD was 51.2 (12.3) years with a mean (SD) disease duration of 24.1 (11.5) years. Disease localization, peri-anal involvement and behavior were not related to LPS-stimulated TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 or IL-10 levels. In addition, combination of localization with behavior to differentiate mild from severe disease type showed no significant differences. TNF-α levels were higher in patients with CD (428 pg/ml IQR [267-468]) compared to healthy controls (459 pg/ml IQR [364-570], p=0.02). We found no associations between SNPs in the promoter region and TNF-α levels. Conclusion In this study, innate cytokine production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 was not related to historical disease characteristics or disease severity in patients with quiescent CD. These findings suggest that genetically determined levels of these cytokines obtained from LPS-stimulated whole blood cultures are not linked with disease behavior or severity."
https://openalex.org/W1534426672,"In the HIV vaccine field, there is a need to produce highly immunogenic forms of the Env protein with the capacity to trigger broad B and T-cell responses. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a chimeric HIV-1 gp120 protein (termed gp120-14K) by fusing gp120 from clade B with the vaccinia virus (VACV) 14K oligomeric protein (derived from A27L gene). Stable CHO cell lines expressing HIV-1 gp120-14K protein were generated and the protein purified was characterized by size exclusion chromatography, electron microscopy and binding to anti-Env antibodies. These approaches indicate that gp120-14K protein is oligomeric and reacts with a wide spectrum of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs), gp120-14K protein upregulates the levels of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with Th1 innate immune responses (IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, RANTES). Moreover, we showed in a murine model, that a heterologous prime/boost immunization protocol consisting of a DNA prime with a plasmid expressing gp120-14K protein followed by a boost with MVA-B [a recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing HIV-1 gp120, Gag, Pol and Nef antigens from clade B], generates stronger, more polyfunctional, and greater effector memory HIV-1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell immune responses, than immunization with DNA-gp120/MVA-B. The DNA/MVA protocol was superior to immunization with the combination of protein/MVA and the latter was superior to a prime/boost of MVA/MVA or protein/protein. In addition, these immunization protocols enhanced antibody responses against gp120 of the class IgG2a and IgG3, together favoring a Th1 humoral immune response. These results demonstrate that fusing HIV-1 gp120 with VACV 14K forms an oligomeric protein which is highly antigenic as it activates a Th1 innate immune response in human moDCs, and in vaccinated mice triggers polyfunctional HIV-1-specific adaptive and memory T-cell immune responses, as well as humoral responses. This novel HIV-1 gp120-14K immunogen might be considered as an HIV vaccine candidate for broad T and B-cell immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W973956272,"Among the influenza A viruses (IAVs) in wild aquatic birds, only H1, H2, and H3 subtypes have caused epidemics in humans. H1N1 viruses of avian origin have also caused 3 of 5 pandemics. To understand the reappearance of H1N1 in the context of pandemic emergence, we investigated whether avian H1N1 IAVs have contributed to the evolution of human, swine, and 2009 pandemic H1N1 IAVs. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, we concluded that the polymerase gene segments (especially PB2 and PA) circulating in North American avian H1N1 IAVs have been reintroduced to swine multiple times, resulting in different lineages that led to the emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 IAVs. Moreover, the similar topologies of hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein and neuraminidase and matrix gene segments suggest that each surface glycoprotein coevolved with an internal gene segment within the H1N1 subtype. The genotype of avian H1N1 IAVs of Charadriiformes origin isolated in 2009 differs from that of avian H1N1 IAVs of Anseriformes origin. When the antigenic sites in the hemagglutinin of all 31 North American avian H1N1 IAVs were considered, 60%-80% of the amino acids at the antigenic sites were identical to those in 1918 and/or 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. Thus, although the pathogenicity of avian H1N1 IAVs could not be inferred from the phylogeny due to the small dataset, the evolutionary process within the H1N1 IAV subtype suggests that the circulation of H1N1 IAVs in wild birds poses a continuous threat for future influenza pandemics in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1662576800,"Legacies of paleoclimates in contemporary biodiversity patterns have mostly been investigated with global datasets, or with weakly dispersive organisms, and as a consequence been interpreted in terms of geographical or physical constraints. If paleoclimatic legacies also occurred at the regional scale in the distributions of vagile organisms within biomes, they would rather suggest behavioral constraints on dispersal, i.e., philopatric syndromes. We examined 1) the residuals of the regression between contemporary energy and passerine species richness in South African biomes and 2) phylogenetic dispersion of passerine assemblages, using occupancy models and quarter-degree resolution citizen science data. We found a northeast to southwest gradient within mesic biomes congruent with the location of Quaternary mesic refugia, overall suggesting that as distance from refugia increased, more clades were lacking from local assemblages. A similar but weaker pattern was detected in the arid Karoo Biomes. In mobile organisms such as birds, behavioral constraints on dispersal appear strong enough to influence species distributions thousands of years after historical range contractions."

Hexapeptides have been identified that bind to junctions and inhibit various junction-processing enzymes, and these peptides confer anti-microbial and anti-tumor properties. Earlier studies suggested that inhibition results from stabilization of peptide-bound Holliday junctions in the square planar conformation. Here, we use single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and two model junctions, which are AT- or GC-rich at the branch points, to show that binding of the peptide KWWCRW induces a dynamic ensemble of junction conformations that differs from both the square planar and stacked X conformations. The specific features of the conformational distributions differ for the two peptide-bound junctions, but both junctions display greatly decreased Mg2+ dependence and increased conformational fluctuations. The smFRET results, complemented by gel mobility shift and small angle x-ray scattering analyses, reveal structural effects of peptides and highlight the sensitivity of smFRET for analyzing complex mixtures of DNA structures. The peptide-induced conformational dynamics suggest multiple stacking arrangements of aromatic amino acids with the nucleobases at the junction core. This conformational heterogeneity may inhibit DNA processing by increasing the population of inactive junction conformations, thereby preventing the binding of processing enzymes and/or resulting in their premature dissociation.

https://openalex.org/W991296310,"It has been argued that measuring governance at scales smaller than global could be an important management tool. However, current studies are conducted on a global scale and use expensive methods. In the present study, we assess whether the reported governance of Amazonian municipalities is related to reductions in deforestation. Economic activity (EA) affected general governance (G) positively (G = 0.81 +1.19 * EA, F1, 98 = 77.36, p < 0.001). Environmental governance (EG) was not affected significantly (p = 0.43) by deforestation before 2000 (PD), but increased significantly (p < 0.001) with general governance (G) (EG = -0.29 + 0.04 PD+0.98*OG, F2,97 = 42.6, p <0.001). Deforestation was not significantly related to environmental governance (p = 0.82). The only indirect effect of significant magnitude was the effect of the density of forest reserves on recent deforestation through deforestation before 2000, which was strongly negative (-0.49). It is possible to assess reported actions to promote municipal governance through official data. However, it is not enough to assume that general governance or environmental governance at the municipal level, as reflected in the official statistics, benefits environmental conservation. In fact, even at the level of nation states, at which most quantification of governance has been undertaken, it seems that the relationship between governance and environmental preservation is only an assumption, because we are aware of no study that supports that hypothesis quantitatively."

We aimed to investigate the anticancer potential of Apaziquone, [EOquin, USAN, E09, 3-hydroxy-5- aziridinyl-1-methyl-2(1H-indole-4,7-dione)–prop-β-en-α-ol], a pro-drug belonging to a class of anti-cancer agents called bioreductive alkylating agents, for OSCC. Apaziquone treatment inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in OSCC cells in vitro. Apaziquone treated OSCC cells showed increased activation of Caspase 9 and Caspase 3, and Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage suggesting induction of apoptosis by apaziquone in oral cancer cells. Importantly, apaziquone treatment significantly reduced oral tumor xenograft volume in immunocompromised NOD/SCID/Crl mice without causing apparent toxicity to normal tissues. In conclusion, our in vitro and in vivo studies identified and demonstrated the pre-clinical efficacy of Apaziquone, as a potential novel anti-cancer therapeutic candidate for oral cancer management."
