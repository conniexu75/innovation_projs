https://openalex.org/W3095708005,"Traditional screening for COVID-19 typically includes survey questions about symptoms and travel history, as well as temperature measurements. Here, we explore whether personal sensor data collected over time may help identify subtle changes indicating an infection, such as in patients with COVID-19. We have developed a smartphone app that collects smartwatch and activity tracker data, as well as self-reported symptoms and diagnostic testing results, from individuals in the United States, and have assessed whether symptom and sensor data can differentiate COVID-19 positive versus negative cases in symptomatic individuals. We enrolled 30,529 participants between 25 March and 7 June 2020, of whom 3,811 reported symptoms. Of these symptomatic individuals, 54 reported testing positive and 279 negative for COVID-19. We found that a combination of symptom and sensor data resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 (interquartile range (IQR): 0.73–0.86) for discriminating between symptomatic individuals who were positive or negative for COVID-19, a performance that is significantly better (P < 0.01) than a model1 that considers symptoms alone (AUC = 0.71; IQR: 0.63–0.79). Such continuous, passively captured data may be complementary to virus testing, which is generally a one-off or infrequent sampling assay. A smartphone app that combines smartwatch and activity tracker data together with self-reported symptoms allows continuous monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection."

We investigated a population of mice that recovered from high-dose radiation to live normal life spans. These ""elite-survivors"" harbored distinct gut microbiota that developed after radiation and protected against radiation-induced damage and death in both germ-free and conventionally housed recipients. Elevated abundances of members of the bacterial taxa Lachnospiraceae and Enterococcaceae were associated with postradiation restoration of hematopoiesis and gastrointestinal repair. These bacteria were also found to be more abundant in leukemia patients undergoing radiotherapy, who also displayed milder gastrointestinal dysfunction. In our study in mice, metabolomics revealed increased fecal concentrations of microbially derived propionate and tryptophan metabolites in elite-survivors. The administration of these metabolites caused long-term radioprotection, mitigation of hematopoietic and gastrointestinal syndromes, and a reduction in proinflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W3097483007,"Structural secrets of hybrid perovskites The optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications of polycrystalline hybrid metal halide perovskite films are notable because grain boundaries in most materials cause scattering of charge carriers that decreases performance. Electron microscopy studies of these materials have been hindered by their rapid structural degradation under intense electron beams. Rothmann et al. now present an atomic crystallographic structure of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI 3 ) polycrystalline thin films obtained by low-electron-dose scanning transmission electron microscopy with advanced image processing. The crystal structure sustains substoichiometry in the A-site cation, has a nearly perfect crystallographic alignment between PbI 2 impurity phases and the FAPbI 3 perovskite, and has atomically clean grain boundaries between polycrystalline domains. These features help to explain the films' surprising regenerative ability, their benign grain boundaries where strain and dislocations appear mostly absent, and why excess lead-iodide precursor can be counterintuitively beneficial.

https://openalex.org/W3095040956,"Dogs were the first domestic animal, but little is known about their population history and to what extent it was linked to humans. We sequenced 27 ancient dog genomes and found that all dogs share a common ancestry distinct from present-day wolves, with limited gene flow from wolves since domestication but substantial dog-to-wolf gene flow. By 11,000 years ago, at least five major ancestry lineages had diversified, demonstrating a deep genetic history of dogs during the Paleolithic. Coanalysis with human genomes reveals aspects of dog population history that mirror humans, including Levant-related ancestry in Africa and early agricultural Europe. Other aspects differ, including the impacts of steppe pastoralist expansions in West and East Eurasia and a near-complete turnover of Neolithic European dog ancestry."
https://openalex.org/W3097489213,"Vacancies enhance proton conductivity Proton-exchange membranes (PEMs) allow for the transport of protons while acting as electrical insulators and ensuring that reactants are kept apart; therefore, they are a key component in devices such as low-temperature fuel cells. PEMs are typically made from polymers or materials embedded in a polymer matrix and need to operate in conditions of very high humidity. Starting with an inorganic, layered material, CdPS 3 , Qian et al. show that the removal of a small amount of cadmium introduces vacancies that greatly increase the proton conductivity of the PEMs (see the Perspective by Wang and He). The process works for manganese-based membranes as well, and high lithium ion transport was also observed. Science , this issue p. 596 ; see also p. 525"

Denisovan remains are rare, being limited to Denisovan Cave in Siberia and a putative, undated jaw from Tibet. However, there is evidence for multiple introgressions from Denisovans into modern-day humans, especially in Australasian populations. By examining the sediment of Baishiya Karst Cave located on a high plateau in Tibet, Zhang et al. identified ancient mitochondrial DNA from Denisovans indicating their presence at about 100 thousand, 60 thousand, and possibly 45 thousand years ago. This finding provides insight into the timing and distribution of Denisovans in Asia and extends the time of occupation of the Tibetan plateau by hominins. Science , this issue p. 584"

Human screens are currently limited to two-dimensional cell cultures, which lack the ability to score tissue-dependent gene function. Esk et al. combined CRISPR-Cas9 screening with barcoded cellular lineage tracing to enable loss-of-function screening in three-dimensional human cerebral organoid tissue. By testing microcephaly candidate genes, the endoplasmic reticulum was found to control extracellular matrix protein secretion regulating tissue integrity and brain size. This genetic screen in human brain tissue implicates multiple pathways in microcephaly and provides a tool for systematic testing of genes in organoids. Science , this issue p. 935"

Less dense compositions involving lighter elements tend to demagnetize well below room temperature or under modest applied external fields.

https://openalex.org/W3095349671,"Addressing the many and the individual The ability to coherently manipulate the quantum state of atomic defects in solid-state systems is a promising route to developing a platform for quantum technologies. A successful platform requires the interaction of many qubits in close proximity, as well as the ability to address each qubit individually, and, to date, such requirements have run counter to each other. Chen et al. devised an optical frequency-domain method with which they were able to simultaneously address many individual rare-earth ion defects (six at this point) with separations all within the diffraction limit of the control light. Because the approach is scalable to tens or hundreds of defects, it provides the prospect of realizing truly large-scale quantum processors. Science , this issue p. 592"
https://openalex.org/W3097006087,"Long noncoding RNAs have been identified as key regulators in the progression of various cancers. LINC00261 has been reported as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancers. However, its function and underlying mechanisms in pancreatic cancer remain largely unclear. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect RNA expression. In situ hybridization was used to discover the subcellular location. The direct binding of LINC00261 to miR-222-3p was verified using a dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. LINC00261-binding proteins were detected using an RNA pulldown assay. LINC00261 was downregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines. Its reduced expression was correlated with advanced pathological stage and poor prognosis. Forced expression of LINC00261 suppressed pancreatic cancer glycolysis and proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, downregulation of LINC00261 was caused by hypermethylation of the CpG island in the promoter region and EZH2-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. Moreover, LINC00261 exerted its biological function by binding to miR-222-3p to activate the HIPK2/ERK/c-myc pathway. In addition, LINC00261 could also reduce c-myc expression by sequestering IGF2BP1. Our study suggests that LINC00261 functions as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer and identifies novel epigenetic and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of LINC00261, which contribute to the targeted therapy of pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3096742301,"Maternal IgE activates fetal mast cells Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells that participate in allergic reactions through their activation by immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. MCs arise early during mammalian development, but it is unclear whether IgE-mediated activation occurs in fetal tissues and what the source of IgE stimulation is. Msallam et al. show that human and mouse fetal MCs can be sensitized by IgE of maternal origin, which crosses the placental barrier through the fetal neonatal Fc receptor (see the Perspective by Rothenberg). Prenatal maternal sensitization conferred transient allergen sensitivity after birth and resulted in the development of postnatal skin and airway inflammation in the offspring after their first exposure to allergen. Thus, both maternal IgE and fetal MCs may influence mother-to-child transmission of allergic disease during gestation. Science , this issue p. 941 ; see also p. 907"

Individuals that return during these times have generally been referred to as parts of distinct groups, or ecotypes, with traits specific to their timing and presumed divergence being caused by the lack of interbreeding. By looking at genomes across fish from both runs, Thompson et al. found that a single genomic region of interest was nearly perfectly associated with run timing but not with other traits such as maturity and fat reserves (see the Perspective by McKinney). Further, they conclude that the region operates as a Mendelian trait, with assortment dictating run timing and associated phenotypes being caused by the migration environment rather than genetics.

We identified part of the machinery that routes auxin transport. The auxin-regulated receptor CAMEL (Canalization-related Auxin-regulated Malectin-type RLK) together with CANAR (Canalization-related Receptor-like kinase) interact with and phosphorylate PIN auxin transporters. camel and canar mutants are impaired in PIN1 subcellular trafficking and auxin-mediated PIN polarization, which macroscopically manifests as defects in leaf venation and vasculature regeneration after wounding. The CAMEL-CANAR receptor complex is part of the auxin feedback that coordinates polarization of individual cells during auxin canalization."

Massilani et al. generated genome-wide data from a 34,000-year-old female individual from the Salkhit Valley in eastern Mongolia and conducted a detailed modeling of her ancestry with regard to other Pleistocene human genomes. They found evidence for Denisovan ancestry in ancient human genomes from at least 6000 years before the Salkhit individual lived and determined that the Denisovan contribution differed from that of another ancient Asian individual, as well as from the ancient Denisovan contribution to extant Australasians.

Here, we introduce the extended endothelial cell culture method (EECM), which differentiates hiPSC-derived endothelial progenitor cells to brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC)-like cells with good barrier properties and mature tight junctions. Importantly, EECM-BMEC-like cells exhibited constitutive cell surface expression of ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and E-selectin. Pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulation increased the cell surface expression of ICAM-1 and induced cell surface expression of P-selectin and VCAM-1. Co-culture of EECM-BMEC-like cells with hiPSC-derived smooth muscle-like cells or their conditioned medium further increased the induction of VCAM-1. Functional expression of endothelial ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was confirmed by T-cell interaction with EECM-BMEC-like cells. Taken together, we introduce the first hiPSC-derived BBB model that displays an adhesion molecule phenotype that is suitable for the study of immune cell interactions."

Xu et al. used satellite imaging to find areas of deformation associated with the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence that moved in the opposite direction. These regions moved in this direction because of inelastic deformation, which helped to accommodate the overall fault rupture for the sequence. The observations were possible because of improved radar imaging and are likely more common than previously believed. Science , this issue p. 605"

https://openalex.org/W3097931167,"Background The spread of coronavirus in the United States with nearly five and half million confirmed cases and over 170,000 deaths has strained public health and health care systems. While many have focused on clinical outcomes, less attention has been paid to vulnerability and risk of infection. In this study, we developed a planning tool that examines factors that affect vulnerability to COVID-19. Methods Across 46 variables, we defined five broad categories: 1) access to medical services, 2) underlying health conditions, 3) environmental exposures, 4) vulnerability to natural disasters, and 5) sociodemographic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. The developed tool was validated by comparing the estimated overall vulnerability with the real-time reported normalized confirmed cases of COVID-19. Analysis A principal component analysis was undertaken to reduce the dimensions. In order to identify vulnerable census tracts, we conducted rank-based exceedance and K-means cluster analyses. Results All of the 5 vulnerability categories, as well as the overall vulnerability, showed significant (P-values <<0.05) and relatively strong correlations (0.203<ρ<0.57) with the normalized confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the census tract level. Our study showed a total of 722,357 (~17% of the County population) people, including 171,403 between the ages of 45–65 (~4% of County’s population), and 76,719 seniors (~2% of County population), are at a higher risk based on the aforementioned categories. The exceedance and K-means cluster analysis demonstrated that census tracts in the northeastern, eastern, southeastern and northwestern regions of the County are at highest risk. Conclusion Policymakers can use this planning tool to identify neighborhoods at high risk for becoming hot spots; efficiently match community resources with needs, and ensure that the most vulnerable have access to equipment, personnel, and medical interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3095806681,"The human solute carrier 22A (SLC22A) family consists of 23 members, representing one of the largest families in the human SLC superfamily. Despite their pharmacological and physiological importance in the absorption and disposition of a range of solutes, eight SLC22A family members remain classified as orphans. In this study, we used a multifaceted approach to identify ligands of orphan SLC22A15. Ligands of SLC22A15 were proposed based on phylogenetic analysis and comparative modeling. The putative ligands were then confirmed by metabolomic screening and uptake assays in SLC22A15 transfected HEK293 cells. Metabolomic studies and transporter assays revealed that SLC22A15 prefers zwitterionic compounds over cations and anions. We identified eight zwitterions, including ergothioneine, carnitine, carnosine, gabapentin, as well as four cations, including MPP+, thiamine, and cimetidine, as substrates of SLC22A15. Carnosine was a specific substrate of SLC22A15 among the transporters in the SLC22A family. SLC22A15 transport of several substrates was sodium-dependent and exhibited a higher Km for ergothioneine, carnitine, and carnosine compared to previously identified transporters for these ligands. This is the first study to characterize the function of SLC22A15. Our studies demonstrate that SLC22A15 may play an important role in determining the systemic and tissue levels of ergothioneine, carnosine, and other zwitterions."
https://openalex.org/W3094685059,"Artificial intelligence (AI), which has demonstrated outstanding achievements in image recognition, can be useful for the tedious capsule endoscopy (CE) reading. We aimed to develop a practical AI-based method that can identify various types of lesions and tried to evaluate the effectiveness of the method under clinical settings. A total of 203,244 CE images were collected from multiple centers selected considering the regional distribution. The AI based on the Inception-Resnet-V2 model was trained with images that were classified into two categories according to their clinical significance. The performance of AI was evaluated with a comparative test involving two groups of reviewers with different experiences. The AI summarized 67,008 (31.89%) images with a probability of more than 0.8 for containing lesions in 210,100 frames of 20 selected CE videos. Using the AI-assisted reading model, reviewers in both the groups exhibited increased lesion detection rates compared to those achieved using the conventional reading model (experts; 34.3%-73.0%; p = 0.029, trainees; 24.7%-53.1%; p = 0.029). The improved result for trainees was comparable to that for the experts (p = 0.057). Further, the AI-assisted reading model significantly shortened the reading time for trainees (1621.0-746.8 min; p = 0.029). Thus, we have developed an AI-assisted reading model that can detect various lesions and can successfully summarize CE images according to clinical significance. The assistance rendered by AI can increase the lesion detection rates of reviewers. Especially, trainees could improve their efficiency of reading as a result of reduced reading time using the AI-assisted model."
https://openalex.org/W3096980128,"As landscapes have become increasingly dominated by intensive agricultural production, plant diversity has declined steeply along with communities of pollinating insects including bees. Semi-natural habitats, such as field edge meadows and hedgerows, can be maintained to provide a diversity of flowering plants that can increase floral resources required by bees. An additional habitat enhancement practice is that of sowing strips of native prairie vegetation within row-cropped fields. In this study, conducted in Iowa, USA, we found that increases in both the abundance and diversity of floral resources in strips of native prairie vegetation within agricultural production fields greatly and positively influenced the bee community. The benefits to the bee community were important for both common and uncommon species and the effect may be strongest early in the season. Using networks of co-occurrence between plant and bee species, we were able to identify two native prairie plants, Ratibida pinnata and Zizia aurea, as potentially keystone resources that can be used to support native bees. When we evaluated the effect of reconstructed prairie strips on bees in the context of the surrounding landscape, we found that these conservation practices had positive effects on bees in agriculturally-dominated areas and that these effects were detectable in low to high complexity landscapes with 8–69% natural habitat. In landscapes dominated by crops with few pollen and nectar resources the inclusion of native prairie strips can buffer the decline of bees and effectively increase bee abundance and diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3096370199,"There is a growing need to enhance the productivity of soybean (Glycine max L.) under severe drought conditions in order to improve global food security status. Melatonin, a ubiquitous hormone, could alleviate drought stress in various plants. Earlier, we demonstrated that exogenous melatonin treatment could enhance the tolerance of drought-treated soybean. However, the underlying mechanisms by which this hormone exerts drought resistance is still unclear. The present study used transcriptomic and metabolomic techniques to determine some critical genes and pathways regulating melatonin response to drought conditions. Results showed that exogenous melatonin treatment could increase relative water content and decrease electrolyte leakage in the leaves and increase seed yield under drought stress. Transcriptomic analysis showed that there were 852 core differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were regulated by drought stress and melatonin in soybean leaves. The most enriched drought-responsive genes are mainly involved in the 'biosynthesis of secondary metabolites'. Metabolomic profiling under drought stress showed higher accumulation levels of secondary metabolites related to drought tolerance after exogenous melatonin treatment. Also, we highlighted the vital role of the pathways including phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, isoflavonoid, and steroid biosynthesis pathways for improvement of drought tolerance in soybean by exogenous melatonin treatment. In all, findings from this study give detailed molecular basis for the application of melatonin as a drought-resistant agent in soybean cultivation."
https://openalex.org/W3095094444,"Overexpression of D-type cyclins in human cancer frequently occurs as a result of protein stabilization, emphasizing the importance of identification of the machinery that regulates their ubiqutin-dependent degradation. Cyclin D3 is overexpressed in ~50% of Burkitt's lymphoma correlating with a mutation of Thr-283. However, the E3 ligase that regulates phosphorylated cyclin D3 and whether a stabilized, phosphorylation deficient mutant of cyclin D3, has oncogenic activity are undefined. We describe the identification of SCF-Fbxl8 as the E3 ligase for Thr-283 phosphorylated cyclin D3. SCF-Fbxl8 poly-ubiquitylates p-Thr-283 cyclin D3 targeting it to the proteasome. Functional investigation demonstrates that Fbxl8 antagonizes cell cycle progression, hematopoietic cell proliferation, and oncogene-induced transformation through degradation of cyclin D3, which is abolished by expression of cyclin D3T283A, a non-phosphorylatable mutant. Clinically, the expression of cyclin D3 is inversely correlated with the expression of Fbxl8 in lymphomas from human patients implicating Fbxl8 functions as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W3095499105,"Mounting evidence from epidemiological and clinical studies has revealed marked correlations between the air pollutant fine particulate matter (FPM) and respiratory diseases. FPM reaches distal airways and deposits in alveolar regions where it can act directly on alveolar macrophages. However, the detailed effect of FPM on the physiological function of alveolar macrophages and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we showed that exposing THP-1–derived macrophages to FPM led to autophagy dysfunction. FPM activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway, which promoted the expression of autophagy-related 2A (ATG2A) and reactive oxygen species generation. The overexpression of ATG2A enhanced the synthesis of autophagic membranes, and the excessive production of reactive oxygen species caused autophagy flux inhibition through disrupting the lysosomal activity. More importantly, FPM impaired the phagocytic ability of macrophages on Escherichia coli and apoptotic neutrophils. Finally, we showed that restoring autophagy rescued the impairment of phagocytic ability induced by FPM. In summary, these results reveal the molecular mechanism of autophagy dysfunction caused by FPM and provide a novel approach to resolve the impaired function of macrophages in respiratory diseases induced by FPM."
https://openalex.org/W3096949241,"Glucose metabolism is pivotal for energy and neurotransmitter synthesis and homeostasis, particularly in Glutamate and GABA systems. In turn, the stringent control of inhibitory/excitatory tonus is known to be relevant in neuropsychiatric conditions. Glutamatergic neurotransmission dominates excitatory synaptic functions and is involved in plasticity and excitotoxicity. GABAergic neurochemistry underlies inhibition and predicts impaired psychophysical function in diabetes. It has also been associated with cognitive decline in people with diabetes. Still, the relation between metabolic homeostasis and neurotransmission remains elusive. Two 3T proton MR spectroscopy studies were independently conducted in the occipital cortex to provide insight into inhibitory/excitatory homeostasis (GABA/Glutamate) and to evaluate the impact of chronic metabolic control on the levels and regulation (as assessed by regression slopes) of the two main neurotransmitters of the CNS in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Compared to controls, participants with T2DM showed significantly lower Glutamate, and also GABA. Nevertheless, higher levels of GABA/Glx (Glutamate+Glutamine), and lower levels of Glutamate were associated with poor metabolic control in participants with T2DM. Importantly, the relationship between GABA/Glx and HbA1c found in T2DM supports a relationship between inhibitory/excitatory balance and metabolic control. Interestingly, this neurometabolic profile was undetected in T1DM. In this condition we found strong evidence for alterations in MRS surrogate measures of neuroinflammation (myo-Inositol), positively related to chronic metabolic control. Our results suggest a role for Glutamate as a global marker of T2DM and a sensitive marker of glycemic status. GABA/Glx may provide a signature of cortical metabolic state in poorly controlled patients as assessed by HbA1c levels, which indicate long-term blood Glucose control. These findings are consistent with an interplay between abnormal neurotransmission and metabolic control in particular in type 2 diabetes thereby revealing dissimilar contributions to the pathophysiology of neural dysfunction in both types of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3097417089,"Introduction Yemen was one of the last countries in the world to declare the first case of the pandemic, on 10 April 2020. Fear and concerns of catastrophic outcomes of the epidemic in Yemen were immediately raised, as the country is facing a complex humanitarian crisis. The purpose of this report is to describe the epidemiological situation in Yemen during the first 2 months of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Methods We analyzed the epidemiological data from 18 February to 05 June 2020, including the 2 months before the confirmation of the first case. We included in our analysis the data from 10 out of 23 governorates of Yemen, located in southern and eastern part of the country. Results A total of 469 laboratory confirmed, 552 probable and 55 suspected cases with onset of symptoms between 18 February and 5 June 2020 were reported through the surveillance system. The median age among confirmed cases was 46 years (range: 1–90 years), and 75% of the confirmed cases were male. A total of 111 deaths were reported among those with confirmed infection. The mean age among those who died was 53 years (range: 14–88 years), with 63% of deaths (n = 70) occurring in individuals under the age 60 years. A total of 268 individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were hospitalized (57%), among whom there were 95 in-hospital deaths, Conclusions The surveillance strategy implemented in the first 2 months of the SARS CoV 2 in the southern and eastern governorates of Yemen, captured mainly severe cases. The mild and moderate cases were not self-reported to the health facilities and surveillance system due to limited resources, stigma, and other barriers. The mortality appeared to be higher in individuals aged under 60 years, and most fatalities occurred in individuals who were in critical condition when they reached the health facilities. It is unclear whether the presence of other acute comorbidities contributed to the high death rate among SARS-CoV-2 cases. The findings only include the southern and eastern part of the country, which is home to 31% of the total population of Yemen, as the data from the northern part of the country was inaccessible for analysis. This makes our results not generalizable to the rest of the country."

This is particularly true for ‘logistically difficult species’ where their cryptic natures, low abundance, patchy distributions and difficult and/or dangerous sampling environments, make traditional surveys near impossible. What results is a lack of ecological knowledge on such marine species. However, advances in UAV technology holds potential for overcoming these logistical difficulties and filling this knowledge gap. Our research focused on one such logistically difficult species, the Australian box Jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri), and we investigated the capacity of consumer grade UAV technology to detect this, highly venomous, target species in the inshore waters of Northern Queensland Australia. At two sites in the Weipa area, we utilized video analysis, visual count comparisons with a netted animal tally, and evaluated the role of associated environmental conditions, such as wind speed, water visibility and cloud cover on jellyfish detection rates. In total fifteen, 70 meter transects were completed between two sites, with 107 individuals captured. Drone success varied between the two sites with a significant difference between field and post-field (laboratory) counts. Animal size and cloud cover also had significant effects on detection rates with an increase in cloud cover and animal size enhancing detection probability. This study provides evidence to suggest drone surveys overcome obstacles that traditional surveys can’t, with respect to species deemed logistically difficult and open scope for further ecological investigations on such species."
https://openalex.org/W3097501673,"Direct payments represent a large share of Swiss farmers’ total household income but compliance with related requirements often entails a high administrative burden. This causes individuals to experience policy implementation as onerous. Based on a framework for administrative burden in citizen-state interactions, we test whether farmers’ individual knowledge, psychological costs and compliance costs help to explain their perception of administrative burden related to direct payments. We refine this framework by testing different specifications of interrelations between psychological costs and perceived administrative burden based on findings from policy feedback theory and education research. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is applied to data collected from a representative sample of 808 Swiss farmers by postal questionnaire in 2019. We find that compliance costs and psychological costs contribute significantly to the perceived administrative burden. In contrast, farmers’ knowledge level contributes to this perception not directly but indirectly, with higher knowledge reducing psychological costs. Our results support policy feedback theory, in that a high level of administrative burden increases psychological costs. Furthermore, well-educated and well-informed farmers show a more positive attitude toward agricultural policy and thus perceive administrative tasks as less onerous. Policy-makers should invest in the reduction of administrative requirements to reduce compliance costs."
https://openalex.org/W3096930793,"We previously showed that calnexin (Canx)-deficient mice are desensitized to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induction, a model that is frequently used to study inflammatory demyelinating diseases, due to increased resistance of the blood-brain barrier to immune cell transmigration. We also discovered that Fabp5, an abundant cytoplasmic lipid-binding protein found in brain endothelial cells, makes protein-protein contact with the cytoplasmic C-tail domain of Canx. Remarkably, both Canx-deficient and Fabp5-deficient mice commonly manifest resistance to EAE induction. Here, we evaluated the importance of Fabp5/Canx interactions on EAE pathogenesis and on the patency of a model blood-brain barrier to T-cell transcellular migration. The results demonstrate that formation of a complex comprised of Fabp5 and the C-tail domain of Canx dictates the permeability of the model blood-brain barrier to immune cells and is also a prerequisite for EAE pathogenesis."

In the present study, we investigated the effect of simultaneous stimulation with low doses of collagen and CXCL12 on the activation of human platelets. The simultaneous stimulation with collagen and CXCL12 induced the secretion of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB and the release of soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) from human platelets in addition to their aggregation, despite the fact that the simultaneous stimulation with thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and CXCL12 had little effects on the platelet aggregation. The agonist of Glycoprotein (GP) Ⅵ convulxin and CXCL12 also induced platelet aggregation synergistically. The monoclonal antibody against CXCR4 but not CXCR7 suppressed the platelet aggregation induced by simultaneous stimulation with collagen and CXCL12. The phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not p44/p42 MAPK, was induced by the simultaneous stimulation. In addition, the simultaneous stimulation with collagen and CXCL12 induced the phosphorylation of HSP27 and the subsequent release of phosphorylated-HSP27 from human platelets. SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, attenuated the platelet aggregation, the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and HSP27, the PDGF-AB secretion, the sCD40L release and the phosphorylated-HSP27 release induced by the simultaneous stimulation with collagen and CXCL12. These results strongly suggest that collagen and CXCL12 in low doses synergistically act to induce PDGF-AB secretion, sCD40L release and phosphorylated-HSP27 release from activated human platelets via p38 MAPK activation."
https://openalex.org/W3097060103,"Primary cilia are critical hubs for several signaling pathways, and defects in ciliogenesis or cilia maintenance produce a range of diseases collectively known as ciliopathies. Ciliogenesis requires vesicle trafficking along a network of microtubules and actin filaments to the basal body. The DIAPH1 (Diaphanous-related formin) family of formins promotes both actin polymerization and EB1-dependent microtubule (MT) stability. EB1 and EB3 have previously been implicated in cilia biogenesis to carry out centrosome-related functions. However, the role of DIAPH1 proteins had not been examined. Here we show that the depletion of DIAPH1 decreased ciliogenesis, cilia length, and reduced trafficking within cilia. Additionally, both actin nucleating and microtubule-stabilizing properties of DIAPH1 are important for their cilia functions. To assess their roles in ciliogenesis in isolation, we targeted DIAPH1 specifically to the basal body, which caused an increase in cilia length and increased trafficking within cilia. Intriguingly, expression of DIAPH1 mutants associated with human deafness and microcephaly impaired ciliation and caused cilia elongation and bulb formation. These results suggest that the actin and microtubule functions of DIAPH1 proteins regulate cilia maintenance in part by regulating vesicular trafficking to the base of the primary cilia."
https://openalex.org/W3097957820,"We studied livestock abortion and various associated risk factors in the Ili region of northwest China. Livestock abortion prevalence was estimated and correlated with infections (Brucellosis, Salmonellosis, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia seropositivity) and management (farming type and contact with other herds/flocks) risk factors. A total of 2996 serum samples (1406 cow, 1590 sheep) were identified by RBPT (Rose Bengal Plate Test) and c-ELISA (competitive-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), and they showed the overall seroprevalence of brucellosis in the study area was cow 6.76%, sheep 9.50%. The seroprevalence of brucellosis in X county was cow 7.06%, sheep 9.12%; in H county was cow 11.70%, sheep 10.80%; and in Q county was cow 4.22%, sheep 9.11%. The overall seroprevalence of Mycoplasma in the study area was cow 3.20%, sheep 6.42%. The seroprevalence of Mycoplasma in X county was cow 3.39%, sheep 7.98%; in H county was cow 5.26%, sheep 9.97%; and in Q county was cow 2.11%, sheep 4.33%. The Odds ratio of brucellosis for cow and sheep, respectively, were 45.909 [95% CI 26.912–78.317, P<0.001] and 70.507 [95% CI 43.783–113.544, P<0.001] times higher than other abortion-related factors including mixed farming, contact with other flocks and Mycoplasma infection. A total of 54 samples, including aborted cow (22), sheep (30) fetuses and milk samples (2), were identified as Brucella melitensis (B. melitensis) positive. A total of 38 Brucella were isolated from 16 aborted cow, 20 sheep fetuses and 2 milk samples. All of these isolates were identified, and confirmed, as B. melitensis. A phylogenetic tree showed that the Brucella isolates closely matched the B. melitensis biovar 3 isolated in Inner Mongolia, China, and B. melitensis isolated from Norway and India. These results suggest that B. melitensis biovar 3 is the main pathogen responsible for cow and sheep abortion and also pose a human health risk. Additionally, livestock reproduction can also be influenced by Mycoplasma infection and managerial factors (farming type and contact with other herds/flocks), especially in remote areas."
https://openalex.org/W3096899993,"Some monoclonal antibodies undergo liquid-liquid phase separation owing to self-attractive associations involving electrostatic and other soft interactions, thereby rendering monoclonal antibodies unsuitable as therapeutics. To mitigate the phase separation, formulation optimization is often performed. However, this is sometimes unsuccessful because of the limited time for the development of therapeutic antibodies. Thus, protein mutations with appropriate design are required. In this report, we describe a case study involving the design of mutants of negatively charged surface residues to reduce liquid-liquid phase separation propensity. Physicochemical analysis of the resulting mutants demonstrated the mutual correlation between the sign of second virial coefficient B2, the Fab dipole moment, and the reduction of liquid-liquid phase separation propensity. Moreover, both the magnitude and direction of the dipole moment appeared to be essential for liquid-liquid phase separation propensity, where electrostatic interaction was the dominant mechanism. These findings could contribute to a better design of mutants with reduced liquid-liquid phase separation propensity and improved drug-like biophysical properties."
https://openalex.org/W3097912187,"Purpose We analyzed the nationwide longitudinal data to explore body mass index (BMI) growth trajectories and the time of adiposity rebound (AR). Methods Personal data of 84,005 subjects born between 2008 and 2012 were obtained from infant health check-ups which were performed at 5, 11, 21, 33, 45, 57, and 69 months. BMI trajectories of each subject were made according to sex and the timing of AR, which was defined as the lowest BMI occurred. Subjects were divided according to birth weight and AR timing as follows: very low birth weight (VLBW), 0.5 kg ≤ Bwt ≤ 1.5 kg; low birth weight (LBW), 1.5 kg < Bwt ≤ 2.5 kg; non-LBW, 2.5 kg < Bwt ≤ 5.0 kg; very early AR, before 45 months; early AR, at 57 months; and moderate-to-late AR, not until 69 months. Main results Median time point of minimum BMI was 45 months, and the prevalence rates of very early, early, and moderate-to-late AR were 63.0%, 16.6%, and 20.4%, respectively. BMI at the age of 57 months showed a strong correlation with AR timing after controlling for birth weight (P < 0.001). Sugar-sweetened beverage intake at 21 months (P = 0.02) and no-exercise habit at 57 months (P < 0.001) showed correlations with early AR. When VLBW and LBW subjects were analyzed, BMI at 57 months and breastfeeding at 11 months were correlated with rapid weight gain during the first 5 months (both P < 0.001). Conclusions Based on this first longitudinal study, the majority of children showed AR before 57 months and the degree of obesity at the age of 57 months had a close correlation with early AR or rapid weight gain during infancy."
https://openalex.org/W3095126610,"Aim Life changes due to the sudden onset of acquired brain injury (ABI) are drastic personal and social changes that require adaptation and are also an important indicator of the quality of life of family caregivers. However, there are no instruments for evaluating life change adaptation among family caregivers of individuals with acquired brain injury. This study aimed to develop the Life Change Adaptation Scale (LCAS) for family caregivers of individuals with ABI and examine its reliability and validity. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-reported questionnaire. A total of 1622 family caregivers of individuals with ABI who belonged to 82 associations for families of individuals with ABI were selected as eligible participants. The construct validity was evaluated using a confirmatory factor analysis. Internal consistency was calculated using Cronbach’s alpha. The K6 was also administered to assess the criterion-related validity of the LCAS. Results In total, 339 valid responses were received. The confirmatory factor analysis identified eight items from two domains, “Changes in the appraisal of caregiving resources” and “Changes in the health belief as a caregiver” (goodness of fit index = 0.963, adjusted goodness of fit index = 0.926, comparative fit index = 0.986, root mean square error of approximation = 0.043.) Cronbach’s alpha was 0.84. The LCAS was negatively correlated with the K6 (r = -0.504; P<0.001). Conclusions The LCAS is a brief, easy-to-administer instrument that is reliable and valid for family caregivers of individuals with ABI. This study contributes to the assessment and identification by family caregivers of individuals with ABI who require aid in adapting to life changes. Further research should be undertaken to verify the predictive value in a longitudinal study and to attempt to apply the LCAS to assess a broader range of subjects in a wider range of settings."
https://openalex.org/W3097599768,"Flight morphological variations and its consequences on animal performance are common in winged insects. In the butterfly Heliconius charithonia, sex-related differences in the wing morphological design have been described resulting in differences in foraging behavior, daily flight distances and flight aerodynamics. It has been suggested that these differences should be reflected in the metabolic capacities and energetic budgets associated with flight in both sexes. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between wing morphological variation and metabolic performance, flight aerodynamics and energetic reserves in females and males of Heliconius charithonia over two years. The results confirm the presence of wing shape sexual dimorphism, but also show an unexpected sex-related annual variation in wing shape, mirrored in the metabolic condition (resting metabolic rate) of individuals. However, contrary to expectation, intersexual variations in wing shape are not related to differences between the sexes in terms of flight aerodynamics, flight metabolic rates, or energetic reserves (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins). Our results indicate a considerable plasticity in H. charithonia wing shape, which we suggest is determined by a trade-off between environmental pressures and reproductive restriction of each sex, maintaining an optimum flight design. Finally, similarities in metabolic rates between young and older males and females in both years may be a consequence of the ability of Heliconius species to feed on pollen."
https://openalex.org/W3097574858,"Decreasing the cost of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, provides a huge amount of data that enables researchers to determine haplotypes for diploid and polyploid organisms. Although various methods have been developed to reconstruct haplotypes in diploid form, their accuracy is still a challenging task. Also, most of the current methods cannot be applied to polyploid form. In this paper, an iterative method is proposed, which employs hypergraph to reconstruct haplotype. The proposed method by utilizing chaotic viewpoint can enhance the obtained haplotypes. For this purpose, a haplotype set was randomly generated as an initial estimate, and its consistency with the input fragments was described by constructing a weighted hypergraph. Partitioning the hypergraph specifies those positions in the haplotype set that need to be corrected. This procedure is repeated until no further improvement could be achieved. Each element of the finalized haplotype set is mapped to a line by chaos game representation, and a coordinate series is defined based on the position of mapped points. Then, some positions with low qualities can be assessed by applying a local projection. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate that this method outperforms most other approaches, and is promising to perform the haplotype assembly."
