https://openalex.org/W2163199119,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can play important gene regulatory roles in nematodes, insects, and plants by basepairing to mRNAs to specify posttranscriptional repression of these messages. However, the mRNAs regulated by vertebrate miRNAs are all unknown. Here we predict more than 400 regulatory target genes for the conserved vertebrate miRNAs by identifying mRNAs with conserved pairing to the 5' region of the miRNA and evaluating the number and quality of these complementary sites. Rigorous tests using shuffled miRNA controls supported a majority of these predictions, with the fraction of false positives estimated at 31% for targets identified in human, mouse, and rat and 22% for targets identified in pufferfish as well as mammals. Eleven predicted targets (out of 15 tested) were supported experimentally using a HeLa cell reporter system. The predicted regulatory targets of mammalian miRNAs were enriched for genes involved in transcriptional regulation but also encompassed an unexpectedly broad range of other functions."

https://openalex.org/W2066581734,"Excitotoxicity in brain ischemia triggers neuronal death and neurological disability, and yet these are not prevented by antiexcitotoxic therapy (AET) in humans. Here, we show that in neurons subjected to prolonged oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), AET unmasks a dominant death mechanism perpetuated by a Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation conductance (IOGD). IOGD was activated by reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS), and permitted neuronal Ca2+ overload and further ROS production despite AET. IOGD currents corresponded to those evoked in HEK-293 cells expressing the nonselective cation conductance TRPM7. In cortical neurons, blocking IOGD or suppressing TRPM7 expression blocked TRPM7 currents, anoxic 45Ca2+ uptake, ROS production, and anoxic death. TRPM7 suppression eliminated the need for AET to rescue anoxic neurons and permitted the survival of neurons previously destined to die from prolonged anoxia. Thus, excitotoxicity is a subset of a greater overall anoxic cell death mechanism, in which TRPM7 channels play a key role."
https://openalex.org/W2039329450,"Prion proteins have the unusual capacity to fold into two functionally distinct conformations, one of which is self-perpetuating. When yeast prion proteins switch state, they produce heritable phenotypes. We report prion-like properties in a neuronal member of the CPEB family (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein), which regulates mRNA translation. Compared to other CPEB family members, the neuronal protein has an N-terminal extension that shares characteristics of yeast prion-determinants: a high glutamine content and predicted conformational flexibility. When fused to a reporter protein in yeast, this region confers upon it the epigenetic changes in state that characterize yeast prions. Full-length CPEB undergoes similar changes, but surprisingly it is the dominant, self-perpetuating prion-like form that has the greatest capacity to stimulate translation of CPEB-regulated mRNA. We hypothesize that conversion of CPEB to a prion-like state in stimulated synapses helps to maintain long-term synaptic changes associated with memory storage."

https://openalex.org/W2018232804,"RNA silencing in plants likely exists as a defense mechanism against molecular parasites such as RNA viruses, retrotransposons, and transgenes. As a result, many plant viruses have adapted mechanisms to evade and suppress gene silencing. Tombusviruses express a 19 kDa protein (p19), which has been shown to suppress RNA silencing in vivo and bind silencing-generated and synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in vitro. Here we report the 2.5 A crystal structure of p19 from the Carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) bound to a 21 nt siRNA and demonstrate in biochemical and in vivo assays that CIRV p19 protein acts as a molecular caliper to specifically select siRNAs based on the length of the duplex region of the RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1968415875,"Serotonin is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. In the periphery, serotonin functions as a ubiquitous hormone involved in vasoconstriction and platelet function. Serotonin is synthesized independently in peripheral tissues and neurons by two different rate-limiting tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) isoenzymes. Here, we show that mice selectively deficient in peripheral TPH and serotonin exhibit impaired hemostasis, resulting in a reduced risk of thrombosis and thromboembolism, although the ultrastructure of the platelets is not affected. While the aggregation of serotonin-deficient platelets in vitro is apparently normal, their adhesion in vivo is reduced due to a blunted secretion of adhesive alpha-granular proteins. In elucidating the mechanism further, we demonstrate that serotonin is transamidated to small GTPases by transglutaminases during activation and aggregation of platelets, rendering these GTPases constitutively active. Our data provides evidence for a receptor-independent signaling mechanism, termed herein as ""serotonylation,"" which leads to alpha-granule exocytosis from platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1985994475,"After inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase by nitric oxide, astrocytes maintain energy production by upregulating glycolysis--a response which does not seem to be available to neurons. Here, we show that in astrocytes, after inhibition of respiration by nitric oxide, there is a rapid, cyclic GMP-independent increase in the activity of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1), a master regulator of glycolysis, and an increase in the concentration of its most powerful positive allosteric activator, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6P(2)). In neurons, nitric oxide failed to alter F2,6P(2) concentration or PFK1 activity. This failure could be accounted for by the much lower amount of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK2, the enzyme responsible for F2,6P(2) biosynthesis) in neurons. Indeed, full activation of neuronal PFK1 was achieved by adding cytosol from nitric oxide-treated astrocytes. Furthermore, using the small interfering RNA (siRNA) strategy, we demonstrated that the rapid activation of glycolysis by nitric oxide is dependent on phosphorylation of the energy charge-sensitive AMP-activated protein kinase, resulting in activation of PFK2 and protection of cells from apoptosis. Thus the virtual absence of PFK2 in neurons may explain their extreme sensitivity to energy depletion and degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2135039550,"Synapse-specific facilitation requires rapamycin-dependent local protein synthesis at the activated synapse. In Aplysia, rapamycin-dependent local protein synthesis serves two functions: (1) it provides a component of the mark at the activated synapse and thereby confers synapse specificity and (2) it stabilizes the synaptic growth associated with long-term facilitation. Here we report that a neuron-specific isoform of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) regulates this synaptic protein synthesis in an activity-dependent manner. Aplysia CPEB protein is upregulated locally at activated synapses, and it is needed not for the initiation but for the stable maintenance of long-term facilitation. We suggest that Aplysia CPEB is one of the stabilizing components of the synaptic mark."
https://openalex.org/W1980541575,"The centrosome and nucleus are intimately associated in most animal cells, yet the significance of this interaction is unknown. Mutations in the zyg-12 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans perturb the attachment of the centrosome to the nucleus, giving rise to aberrant spindles and ultimately, DNA segregation defects and lethality. These phenotypes indicate that the attachment is essential. ZYG-12 is a member of the Hook family of cytoskeletal linker proteins and localizes to both the nuclear envelope (via SUN-1) and centrosomes. ZYG-12 is able to bind the dynein subunit DLI-1 in a two-hybrid assay and is required for dynein localization to the nuclear envelope. Loss of dynein function causes a low percentage of defective centrosome/nuclei interactions in both Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. We propose that dynein and ZYG-12 move the centrosomes toward the nucleus, followed by a ZYG-12/SUN-1-dependent anchorage."
https://openalex.org/W2006964534,"Blockade of hERG K+ channels in the heart is an unintentional side effect of many drugs and can induce cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. It has become common practice in the past few years to screen compounds for hERG channel activity early during the drug discovery process. Understanding the molecular basis of drug binding to hERG is crucial for the rational design of medications devoid of this activity. We previously identified 2 aromatic residues, Tyr-652 and Phe-656, located in the S6 domain of hERG, as critical sites of interaction with structurally diverse drugs. Here, Tyr-652 and Phe-656 were systematically mutated to different residues to determine how the physicochemical properties of the amino acid side group affected channel block by cisapride, terfenadine, and MK-499. The potency for block by all three drugs was well correlated with measures of hydrophobicity, especially the two-dimensional approximation of the van der Waals hydrophobic surface area of the side chain of residue 656. For residue 652, an aromatic side group was essential for high affinity block, suggesting the importance of a cation-π interaction between Tyr-652 and the basic tertiary nitrogen of these drugs. hERG also lacks a Pro-Val-Pro motif common to the S6 domain of most other voltage-gated K+ channels. Introduction of Pro-Val-Pro into hERG reduced sensitivity to drugs but also altered channel gating. Together, these findings assign specific residues to receptor fields predicted by pharmacophore models of hERG channel blockers and provide a refined molecular understanding of the drug binding site.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) 1The abbreviations used are: LQTS, long QT syndrome; hERG, human ether-a-go-go related gene; Kv, voltage-gated K+; V½, voltage half-point for channel activation; VHSA, van der Waals hydrophobic surface area; WT, wild type; Mes, 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid; EAG, ether-a-go-go. is a disorder of ventricular repolarization that predisposes affected individuals to cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. Inherited LQTS is caused by mutations in K+ or Na+ ion channel genes or ankyrin-B (1Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 2Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. DuBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K.

Acquired LQTS is more common and can be induced as an unintended and rare side effect of treatment with many structurally diverse medications. In the past few years, several commonly used drugs (e.g. terfenadine, cisapride, sertindole, thioridazine, grepafloxacin) were withdrawn from the market, or their approved use was severely restricted, when it was discovered that they caused arrhythmia or were associated with unexplained sudden death, albeit very infrequently (3Pearlstein R. Vaz R. Rampe D. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of drug-induced LQTS is block of human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) channels that conduct IKr, the rapid delayed rectifier K+ current important for repolarization of cardiac action potentials (4Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 5Trudeau M. Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Robertson G.A. Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). A reduction in IKr prolongs the action potential duration of ventricular myocytes, lengthens the QT interval and increases dispersion as measured by ECG recordings, and increases the risk of torsades de pointes, a ventricular tachyarrhythmia that can degenerate into fibrillation and cause sudden death. In a laboratory setting, it is possible to induce arrhythmia in animals with drugs that block voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels other than hERG. However, in clinical practice, drug-induced LQTS is always attributable to direct or indirect (via interference with metabolism of a co-administered medication) block of hERG channels (6Redfern W.S. Carlsson L. Davis A.S. Lynch W.G. MacKenzie I. Palethorpe S. Siegl P.K. Strang I. Sullivan A.T. Wallis R. Camm A.J. Hammond T.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 32-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). This understanding has prompted intense efforts to quantify hERG channel activity of new chemical entities during an early stage of the drug development process (6Redfern W.S. Carlsson L. Davis A.S. Lynch W.G. MacKenzie I. Palethorpe S. Siegl P.K. Strang I. Sullivan A.T. Wallis R. Camm A.J. Hammond T.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 32-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 7Fermini B. Fossa A.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). A better understanding of the molecular basis of hERG channel block could facilitate computer-assisted drug design and enable presynthetic, virtual screening of compounds for hERG activity. Moreover, a description of the physicochemical features of the drug binding site would complement pharmacophore models (8Cavalli A. Poluzzi E. De Ponti F. Recanatini M. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 3844-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 9Ekins S. Crumb W.J. Sarazan R.D. Wikel J.H. Wrighton S.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) of drugs that block hERG channels and define the molecular basis for receptor fields predicted by these models. Toward this goal, we have used site-directed mutagenesis and voltage clamp analysis of mutant channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of hERG channel block by structurally diverse drugs, including MK-499, cisapride, terfenadine, vesnarinone, chloroquine, and quinidine (10Mitcheson J.S.

These studies identified 2 aromatic residues, Tyr-652 and Phe-656, located in the S6 domain and predicted to face the central cavity of the channel (Fig. 1a) that are critical for high affinity binding of these drugs. Kv channels of the Kv1–4 families have an Ile or Val residue in the positions equivalent to Tyr-652 or Phe-656 of hERG (Fig. 1b). This suggests a plausible explanation for why hERG and not Kv1–4 channels are readily blocked by structurally diverse drugs: aromatic residues in S6 are required for high affinity binding. In addition, Kv1–4 channel α-subunits have a Pro-Val(Ile)-Pro motif in the S6 domain that was suggested to cause a bend in the α-helix and alter the shape of the central cavity as compared with that predicted for KcsA, a K+ channel that lacks these Pro residues. The S6 domain of hERG also lacks the Pro-Val-Pro motif and instead has the residues Ile-Phe-Gly in the equivalent positions. Thus, we previously proposed that aromatic residues (2 on each subunit, 8 per channel) that face the inner cavity, and the lack of the Pro-Val-Pro motif, were important determinants of the high affinity hERG channel binding site (10Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). EAG channels also lack a Pro-Val-Pro motif and have a Tyr and Phe in the S6 domain but are relatively insensitive to drugs that block hERG. However, EAG channels were made sensitive to block by cisapride by moving the Tyr residue by one position in the S6 domain (14Chen J. Seebohm G. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12461-12466Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Pharmacophore models predict that important features of potent hERG channel blockers are 1) a basic nitrogen that is usually protonated at physiological pH and 2) three hydrophobic centers of mass (centroids) arranged in a specific spatial pattern around the centrally located nitrogen (8Cavalli A. Poluzzi E. De Ponti F. Recanatini M. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 3844-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 9Ekins S. Crumb W.J. Sarazan R.D. Wikel J.H. Wrighton S.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). For many potent hERG blockers, these centroids are aromatic groups. We and others have postulated that π -stacking between aromatic groups of the drug and Phe-656 and Tyr-652 of hERG are required for high affinity binding and channel block (10Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 15Lees-Miller J.P. Duan Y. Teng G.Q. Duff H.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 367-374PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, because most hERG blockers contain a basic nitrogen, it has been suggested that cation-π interactions with Tyr-652 or Phe-656 might also be required for high affinity binding to the channel. In this study, we systematically investigated these hypotheses by mutating Tyr-652 and Phe-656 to several other amino acids and determined the sensitivity of the resulting mutant channels to block by cisapride, MK-499, and terfenadine. A quantitative comparison between the IC50 values for the mutant channels and the physicochemical properties of the side chain of the mutant residues was used to provide further insights into the molecular features of the hERG binding site. Molecular Biology—Point mutations of hERG subcloned into the pSP64 plasmid expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) were made as described (10Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Constructs were confirmed with restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Complementary RNAs for injection into oocytes were prepared with SP6 Cap-Scribe (Roche Applied Science) following linearization of the expression construct with EcoRI. Oocytes were injected with 5–10 ng of hERG cRNA 2 days before use in voltage clamp experiments. Voltage Clamp of Oocytes—Isolation and maintenance of Xenopus laevis oocytes and cRNA injections were performed as described (16Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 667-675Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Currents were recorded at room temperature (22–24 °C) with a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) using standard two-microelectrode voltage clamp techniques (17Stuhmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Oocytes were bathed in a low Cl– solution containing 96 mm NaMes, 2 mm KMes, 2 mm CaMes2, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.6 with methanesulfonic acid. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships were determined with test pulses applied to voltages ranging from –60 to +50 mV, at a frequency of 0.06 Hz and from a holding potential of –90 mV. Deactivating (tail) currents were measured at –70 mV. To quantify drug-induced block of hERG, currents were elicited with 5-s pulses to 0 mV, applied repetitively at 0.166 Hz from a holding potential of –90 mV. Drug-induced block of current was assessed by measuring the outward currents at the end of the 5-s pulse to 0 mV, a test potential that minimized the contribution of leak or endogenous currents. Cisapride (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ), terfenadine (Sigma), and MK-499 (Merck Research Laboratories) were prepared as 10 mm stock solutions in Me2SO and then dissolved in the external solution immediately before use to obtain desired concentrations. Data Analysis—Analyses of the kinetics of current activation and deactivation were performed using curve fitting routines of Clampfit software (Axon Instruments). The amplitudes of hERG tail currents were fit with a Boltzmann function to estimate the half-point (V ½) and slope factor (k) for the voltage dependence of channel activation using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Concentration effect data were fit to the Hill equation to determine the drug concentration required for 50% inhibition (IC50) and the Hill coefficient (h). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. (n = number of cells), and statistical comparisons between experimental groups were performed using the Student’s t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Theoretical and physicochemical descriptors were calculated for each of the amino acids substituted at Phe-656 using the Molecular Operating Environment, MOE (Molecular Operating Environment 2003, Chemical Computing Group, Inc., Montreal, Quebec). MOE is a general purpose computational chemistry software application capable of calculating 146 two-dimensional descriptors. Two-dimensional descriptors do not require geometric information about the molecules of interest, making them a suitable choice when modeling the properties of fragments of macromolecular structures. Examples of these descriptors include atom, bond, and fragment counts, graph theoretical connectivity and shape indices, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity measures, topological charge measures, and two-dimensional van der Waal approximations of surface areas and volumes. Of the 146 descriptors calculated, 115 had non-zero values for the amino acids being modeled. The search for predictive subsets of descriptors was performed using a simulated annealing feature selection algorithm (18Sutter J.M. Jurs P.C. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1995; 35: 77-84Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar) included in the ADAPT software package (19Jurs P.C. Chou J.T. Yuan M. Olsen E.C. Christoffersen R.E. Computer Assisted Drug Design. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1979: 103-129Google Scholar, 20Stuper A.J. Jurs P.C. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1976; 2: 99-105Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Simulated annealing is an optimization algorithm that has found widespread use in the area of variable selection in computational correlation studies. The algorithm attempts to identify subsets of descriptors that best correlate with the experimental end point of interest. In many cases, the direct relevance of descriptors selected to the property being studied is observed. The optimal descriptor subset, or model, is identified as that which minimizes the root-mean-square error between the predicted and experimental log(fold-change in IC50) values and possesses the highest correlation coefficient (R2). MOE and the simulated annealing calculations were performed on an SGI Octane 2 Work station. All other data analysis and manipulation was done using Microsoft Excel under the Windows 2000 operating system. Biophysical Properties of Phe-656 Mutant hERG Channels— The residue equivalent to Phe-656 in hERG is conserved in hEAG (Fig. 1b). However, in most other Kv channels, this amino acid is a Val or Ile and is the middle residue of a Pro-Val(Ile)-Pro motif that has been proposed to produce a bend in the S6 domain near the site of activation gating (21del Camino D. Holmgren M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Nature. 2000; 403: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We determined the biophysical and pharmacological consequences of mutating Phe-656 to 12 other residues, including Ile and Val. Seven of the mutant channels, produced by mutation of Phe-656 to Val, Ile, Leu, Met, Thr, Trp, or Tyr, retained relatively normal biophysical properties. Currents elicited by 2-s pulses to a variable voltage from a holding potential of –90 mV are shown in Fig. 2. The I-V relationships for these mutant channels were bell-shaped and peaked at a voltage near –10 mV when currents were activated with 2-s pulses (Fig. 2b). These properties are similar to WT hERG channels, and because the rectification of the I-V relationship results from rapid inactivation, they indicate that the mutant channels retained a relatively normal voltage dependence of inactivation. The voltage dependence of channel activation of WT hERG had a half-point (V½) of –17.8 ± 1.2 mV and a slope factor (k) of 7.8 ± 0.2 mV (n = 5). Most of the mutations caused relatively minor shifts in the V½ for activation (all within ±8 mV) or changes in the time constant for the onset of activation at –20 mV (Table I). An exception was the F656W mutation that shifted V½ by –25 mV. Most of the mutations induced significant changes in the rate of deactivation, but K+ selectivity was not altered based upon the lack of effects on reversal potential of the current (Table I). There was no correlation between the kinetics of activation or deactivation and physicochemical parameters such as hydrophobicity, non-polar surface area, or volume of the side group for the amino acid substituted for Phe (data not shown). Mutation of Phe-656 to Gly, Ser, Arg, or Glu reduced functional expression and disrupted closure of channels (Fig. 2c), and therefore, the voltage dependence and kinetics of gating were not determined for these mutant channels.Table IBiophysical parameters of mutant hERG channelsHERG channelActivationDeactivationErevNumberV½kττslowτfastArefmVmVmsmsmsmVnWT-17.8 ± 1.27.8 ± 0.21386 ± 94743 ± 39156 ± 80.30-105 ± 1.25F656W-43.3 ± 1.1**6.5 ± 0.4*409 ± 28**1145 ± 58**140 ± 50.16**-107 ± 1.66F656Y-23.8 ± 0.9**9.4 ± 0.4**877 ± 49**290 ± 14**60 ± 1**0.68**-105 ± 1.68F656M-21.5 ± 0.8*7.8 ± 0.41301 ± 44675 ± 55109 ± 4**0.40-106 ± 1.66F656L-14.8 ± 1.08.6 ± 0.71362 ± 95237 ± 11**63 ± 3**0.66**-105 ± 0.36F656I-11.6 ± 0.8**7.9 ± 0.41116 ± 57*144 ± 5**47 ± 2**0.83**-100 ± 2.15F656V-22.1 ± 1.1*6.6 ± 0.1**1020 ± 66**265 ± 13**93 ± 4**0.67**-111 ± 1.15F656T-23.0 ± 0.7**7.2 ± 0.41223 ± 44579 ± 24**120 ± 9**0.43*-107 ± 1.86Y652W-20.4 ± 0.78.2 ± 0.1940 ± 22**461 ± 34**77 ± 3**0.60**-102 ± 1.26Y652F-27.6 ± 0.7**10.1 ± 0.6**916 ± 19**622 ± 14**78 ± 2**0.30-104 ± 1.06Y652IaDeactivation fit with monoexponential function; Erev determined using 20 mM [K+]e.+7.3 ± 1.27**11.2 ± 0.2**574 ± 8.6**—6.1 ± 1.6**0.89**-41 ± 0.85Y652V-5.9 ± 0.2**7.9 ± 0.3555 ± 32**29 ± 1.2**13 ± 0.2**0.57**-106 ± 0.45Y652T-12 ± 0.8**8.5 ± 0.2931 ± 25**122 ± 4**38 ± 0.6**0.77**-103 ± 1.28Y652Q-3.6 ± 0.3**8.4 ± 0.2596 ± 17**40 ± 8.8**13 ± 1.0**0.80**-102 ± 0.95Y652E-9.5 ± 1.2**7.1 ± 0.2680 ± 38**99 ± 10**37 ± 6**0.57-103 ± 1.75a Deactivation fit with monoexponential function; Erev determined using 20 mM [K+]e. Open table in a new tab Hydrophobicity of Residue 656 Determines Potency of hERG Channel Blockers—The sensitivity of Phe-656 mutant channels to drugs was determined by measuring the decrease in current activated by 5-s pulses applied repetitively to 0 mV. Examples of steady-state block of WT and five mutant Phe-656 hERG channels achieved with 1 or 10 μm MK-499 are shown in Fig. 3a. Concentration-response relationships for MK-499 for these same channels are plotted in Fig. 3b. As expected, if aromaticity is important for drug sensitivity, mutation of Phe-656 to the other natural aromatic amino acids Trp or Tyr altered block by MK-499 only slightly (IC50 increased by a factor of 1.8 and 3.3, respectively). In contrast, the IC50 was increased by over 3 orders of magnitude when Phe-656 was mutated to Gly, Glu, or Arg, mutations that also severely disrupted channel gating (Fig. 2c). Unexpectedly, the IC50 for MK-499 was only moderately increased when Phe-656 was mutated to the non-aromatic residues Met, Leu, or Ile. For these residues, the IC50 was increased by a factor of 3.7, 7.8, and 11, respectively (Table II). We also determined the sensitivity of all 12 mutant channels to block by cisapride (Fig. 3c) and terfenadine (Fig. 3b). Similar to MK-499, the IC50 values for these drugs were only slightly changed when Phe-656 was mutated to Tyr or Trp and increased the most by mutation to Gly or Arg (Table II). Again, mutation of Phe-656 to the hydrophobic residues Met, Leu, or Ile had little or no effect on channel sensitivity to block by cisapride and terfenadine.Table IISummary of IC50 values and Hill coefficients determined from concentration-response relationships for MK-499, cisapride, and terfenadine block of Phe-656 and Tyr-652 mutant hERG channelsTable IISummary of IC50 values and Hill coefficients determined from concentration-response relationships for MK-499, cisapride, and terfenadine block of Phe-656 and Tyr-652 mutant hERG channels Block of hERG by some drugs (e.g. quinidine and chloroquine) is voltage-dependent (12Sanchez-Chapula J.A.

Navarro-Polanco R.A. Sanguinetti M.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and therefore, the test potential chosen to determine IC50 can be important. However, MK-499 (22Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and terfenadine (23Roy M.-L. Dumaine R. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 1996; 94: 817-823Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar) do not block hERG in a voltage-dependent manner, and cisapride exhibits only modest voltage dependence (24Potet F. Bouyssou T. Escande D. Baro I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 1007-1012PubMed Google Scholar). The only Phe-656 mutation that significantly altered the voltage dependence of gating was F656W; however, the IC50 values for this mutant channel were not significantly altered. We also tested for voltage dependence of block for F656T and F656M. Block was voltage-independent for both mutant channels by all three drugs (n = 4–6 for each drug, data not shown). Thus, it is appropriate to measure block of hERG by these drugs at 0 mV to determine IC50 values. The logarithmic value for the -fold change in IC50 (relative to WT hERG) for each mutant channel was regressed as a function of a variety of physical and calculated properties of the amino acids substituted for Phe-656. The parameters chosen for regression analysis were three physical parameters, the side chain surface area, free energies of transfer from octanol to neutral aqueous solution, and buried residue non-polar surface area, and the 115 calculated two-dimensional descriptors from MOE. For all parameters investigated, the correlation was highest for MK-499 and weakest for terfenadine. The calculated descriptor that was best correlated with logarithmic -fold change in IC50, for all three compounds, was the two-dimensional van der Waals hydrophobic surface area (VHSA). VHSA is calculated by summing the approximate van der Waals surface areas of atoms deemed hydrophobic in character. VHSA accounts for the hydrophobicity of the sulfur atom of Met and was thus superior in predictive power to the non-polar surface area physical parameter, which does not take this into account. Table III summarizes the correlation coefficients (R2) for the linear regression plots of physicochemical descriptors versus experimental log(fold change in IC50). Fig. 4 shows a plot of the predicted versus experimental log(fold change in IC50) for the three drugs based on the VHSA values using ADAPT as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Predicted values for additional residues can be determined by inserting the VHSA value for the residue into each of the three equations presented in the legend of Fig. 4.Table IIISummary of linear correlation coefficients (R2) for relationships between physicochemical properties and drug sensitivity of Phe-656 mutant channelsMK-499CisaprideTerfenadineAllNo ArgNormal gatingAllNo ArgNormal gatingAllNo ArgNormal gatingSide chain surface area0.382*0.706†0.857†0.3020.591†0.726†0.2950.648†0.669*Non-polar surface area0.846†0.870†0.743†0.747†0.763†0.585*0.698†0.728†0.509*Octanol → water0.842†0.849†0.763†0.847†0.851†0.734†0.786†0.739†0.613*VHSA0.881†0.970†0.958†0.811†0.897†0.858†0.768†0.887†0.794†VHSA + nN0.980†0.976†0.974†0.927†0.917†0.904†0.930†0.928†0.881† Open table in a new tab The correlations between VHSA and experimental values were further improved if the data points for residues that significantly altered the channel gating were removed from the analysis. The correlation coefficients for analyses without Arg, and without Arg, Glu, Gly, and Ser are included in Table III. Other calculated descriptors related to hydrophobicity demonstrated high correlations as well, including the Crippen fragment-derived logP estimator (SlogP) (25Wildman S.A. Crippen G.M. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1999; 39: 868-873Crossref Scopus (839) Google Scholar), a linear logP model estimator (logP (octanol/water), from P. Labute in MOE), and a simple count of the number of hydrophobic atoms. SlogP and logP (octanol/water) differ from VHSA in that they account for all atoms in each residue, rather than just the hydrophobic atoms. In addition to hydrophobicity measures, descriptors encoding the sums of two-dimensional van der Waals surface areas of partially positive atoms and partially negative atoms, separately, were among the more highly correlated metrics, but not as highly correlated as the hydrophobicity measures. When considering the full data set (i.e. all 3 compounds and all 13 amino acids), VHSA was the most highly correlated descriptor and possessed the most statistical significance (F-test, t test, p value). SlogP and logP (octanol/water) were always the second and third most highly correlated descriptors, respectively, indicating a clear consensus that hydrophobicity is a driving force behind the observed data. The simulated annealing algorithm was used to search for optimal two-descriptor models and identified the combination of VHSA and nN, the number of nitrogen atoms, as a superior predictor of log(fold change in IC50) for all three compounds. In this context, nN is merely a correction factor for residues that contain more than one nitrogen atom (i.e. Trp and Arg). For example, R2 for the plot of predicted versus experimental IC50 values was 0.88 (root-mean-square error = 0.4) when VHSA was the sole descriptor, but adding the nN term to the quantitative structure activity relationship fit enhanced R2 to 0.98 (root-mean-square error = 0.163) for MK-499. The equations for the linear regression analyses evaluating VHSA + nN for MK-499 (Equation 1), cisapride (Equation 2), and terfenadine (Equation 3) were as follows. y=3.674-0.0389*VHSA+0.446*nN(Eq. 1) y=2.762-0.033*VHSA+0.437*nN(Eq. 2) y=1.707-0.022*VHSA+0.357*nN(Eq. 3) The R2 values obtained from these regression analyses are listed in Table III. A better fit could also be obtained by omitting Arg from the analysis (Table III, No Arg), perhaps because this residue repels the basic nitrogen of the drug and diminishes binding affinity even more than expected based simply on hydrophobic surface area of the side chain. Together, these data indicate that the important physicochemical feature of Phe-656 is hydrophobic volume, not aromaticity per se. Aromatic Residue at Position 652 Required for Potent hERG Channel Block—The residue equivalent to Tyr-652 in hERG is conserved in EAG; however, in Kv1–4 channels, this amino acid is Ile (Fig. 1b). Tyr-652 was mutated to 8 other residues (Phe, Trp, Ala, Val, Glu, Gln, Ile, Thr) to determine the effect of changing the volume, size, polarity, and hydrophobicity of the side group on drug sensitivity. Mutations of Tyr-652 were well tolerated, and the mutant channels retained K+ selectivity and relatively normal biophysical properties (Fig. 5 and Table I). Drugs might interact by H-bonding to the hydroxyl group or via cation-π or π -stacking with the phenol of Tyr-652. Mutation of Tyr-652 to Phe or Trp reduced or did not significantly change the sensitivity to MK-499 (Fig. 6, a and b), and like WT hERG, block of"

In the fungus Aspergillus nidulans (teleomorph: Emericella nidulans) endogenous oxylipins, called psi factor, serve as hormone-like signals that modulate the timing and balance between sexual and asexual spore development. Here, we report the identification of A. nidulans ppoA, encoding a putative fatty acid dioxygenase, involved in the biosynthesis of the linoleic acid derived oxylipin psiBα. PpoA is required for balancing anamorph and teleomorph development. Deletion of ppoA significantly reduced the level of psiBα and increased the ratio of asexual to sexual spore numbers 4-fold. In contrast, forced expression of ppoA resulted in elevated levels of psiBα and decreased the ratio of asexual to sexual spore numbers 6-fold. ppoA expression is mediated by two developmental regulators, VeA and the COP9 signalosome, such that ppoA transcript levels are correlated with the initiation of asexual and sexual fruiting body formation. PpoA localizes in lipid bodies in these tissues. These data support an important role for oxylipins in integrating mitotic and meiotic spore development.

PpoA localizes in lipid bodies in these tissues. These data support an important role for oxylipins in integrating mitotic and meiotic spore development. A unique property of many fungi is their ability to propagate by both sexual and asexual spores. The integration of the teleomorph (meiotic sexual morph) and anamorph (mitotic asexual morph) stages into the fungal life cycle lends great flexibility in dispersal and survival during suboptimal environmental conditions, both very important characteristics for organisms that are essentially sessile in their somatic stage. Aspergillus nidulans (teleomorph: Emericella nidulans) is a homothallic ascomycete with a defined asexual and sexual cycle that has long served as a model system for understanding the genetic regulation of asexual development and secondary metabolism in filamentous fungi (1Adams T.H. Wieser J.K. Yu J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 35-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Calvo A.M. Wilson R.A. Bok J.W. Keller N.P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The asexual cycle is characterized by the production of haploid conidiophores that bear single-cell asexual spores called conidia. Sexual development commences with the formation of multinucleate globular cells, called Hülle cells that surround the cleistothecium, the ascocarp that contains sexual spores called ascospores. The program of asexual and sexual sporulation is characterized by many developmental stages, including temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression, cell specialization, and intercellular communication (1Adams T.H. Wieser J.K. Yu J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 35-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Calvo A.M. Wilson R.A. Bok J.W. Keller N.P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The A. nidulans asexual reproductive cycle can be divided into at least three different stages: (i) a growth phase required for cells to acquire the ability to respond to induction signals (competence phenomenon), (ii) initiation of the developmental pathway, and (iii) execution of the developmentally regulated events leading to sporulation. A development-specific array of transcription factors is activated that controls the expression of multiple sets of genes required for conidiophore morphogenesis (1Adams T.H. Wieser J.K. Yu J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 35-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sexual fruiting body formation is influenced by several environmental and genetic determinants; however, the molecular pathways for this developmental stage are not well dissected (3Braus G.H. Krappmann S. Eckert S.E. Osiewacz H.D. Molecular Biology of Fungal Development. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York2002: 215-244Google Scholar). Current studies are focusing on the characterization of mutants defective in sexual reproduction (4Han K.H. Han K.Y. Yu J.H. Chae K.S. Jahng K.Y. Han D.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Normal sexual and asexual development in A. nidulans requires the function of the velvet (veA) gene (5Kim H. Han K. Kim K. Han D. Jahng K. Chae K. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2002; 37: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). VeA is known to have a role in activating sexual development and/or inhibiting asexual development, because asexual sporulation in the veA1 mutant is promoted and increased, whereas sexual development is significantly delayed and reduced (5Kim H. Han K. Kim K. Han D. Jahng K. Chae K. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2002; 37: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 6Champe S.P. Kurtz M.B. Yager L.N. Butnick N.Z. Axelrod D.E. Hohl H.R. Turian G.

Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, MA1992: 19-41Google Scholar). Furthermore, veA1 mutants do not exhibit light-dependent development of conidia and ascospores in contrast to the wild type where light induces asexual and delays and reduces sexual spore production (7Yager L.N. Bennett J.W. Klich M.A. Aspergillus: Biology and Industrial Applications. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, MA1992: 19-41Google Scholar). The veA1 mutant gene differs from that of the wild type by one nucleotide in the initiation codon resulting in a putative truncated protein by 37 amino acids. veA null (ΔveA) mutants do not form cleistothecia; by contrast, overexpression of veA gene leads to formation of cleistothecia even in liquid culture and to formation of fewer conidial heads than in a wild type on solid media (5Kim H. Han K. Kim K. Han D. Jahng K. Chae K. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2002; 37: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Butnick et al. (8Butnick N.Z. Yager L.N. Hermann T.E. Kurtz M.B. Champe S.P. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 533-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified two mutants (acoB202 and acoC193) in A. nidulans that fail to become competent and are blocked in both sexual and asexual sporulation. These mutants overproduce hormone-like fatty acid-derived oxylipins collectively termed psi factor (precocious sexual inducer). The psi factor serves as signals that modulate sexual and asexual sporulation by affecting the timing and balance of asexual and sexual spore development (9Champe S.P. Rao P. Chang A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 1383-1387PubMed Google Scholar, 10Champe S.P. el-Zayat A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3982-3988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Calvo A.M. Gardner H.W. Keller N.P. J. Biol.

Biochemical analyses revealed that psi factor is composed primarily of hydroxylated oleic (18:1) and linoleic (18:2) moieties called psiβ and psiα, respectively (10Champe S.P. el-Zayat A.A. J.

The positioning of the hydroxy groups on the fatty acid backbone further designates the psi compounds as psiB (8′-hydroxy-), psiC (5′,8′-dihydroxy-), and psiA, which is designated for a lactone ring of psiC at the 5′ position (Fig. 1). Studies, only carried out for the linoleic acid-derived psiα molecules, showed that psiBα and psiCα stimulated sexual and inhibited asexual spore development, whereas psiAα had the opposite effect (9Champe S.P.

Our interest in psi factor stems from its role as a signal in Aspergillus sexual and asexual sporulation (9Champe S.P. Rao P. Chang A. J. Gen.

To gain more insight into the relationship between morphological development and psi factor/oxylipin biosynthesis, we have initiated studies to identify and characterize fatty acid dioxygenases in A. nidulans responsible for the production of oxylipins. Here we describe PpoA, a putative dioxygenase localized to lipid bodies in asexual and sexual fruiting structures. Deletion of ppoA reduced the level of the linoleic acid-derived psiBα and increased the ratio of asexual to sexual spore development 4-fold. On the other hand, forced expression of ppoA resulted in elevated levels of psiBα and decreased the ratio of asexual to sexual spore development 6-fold. Previous studies have shown similar results by adding exogenous pisBα in confluent mycelial cultures (10Champe S.P. el-Zayat A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3982-3988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normal expression of ppoA required the two developmental regulators, VeA and COP9 signalosome. This is the first study that shows at a genetic level the direct involvement of oxylipins in spore development in A. nidulans.

Illumination was carried out in an incubator equipped with General Electric 15-watt broad spectrum fluorescent light bulbs (F15T12CW) placed 50 cm below the plates. Developmental cultures were grown on GMM, and asexual and sexual induction was performed as previously described (4Han K.H. Han K.Y. Yu J.H. Chae K.S. Jahng K.Y. Han D.M. Mol.

Oligonucleotides ppoA-F1 and ppoA-R1 were designed based upon a 3558-bp A. nidulans genomic sequence (contig ANI61C3259), predicting a fragment with high identity to Lds. These primers were used to amplify an 1100-bp fragment by PCR, using A. nidulans genomic DNA as template. This PCR product was used as a probe to screen the A. nidulans pLORIST and pWE15 cosmid libraries (Fungal Genetics Stock Center, Kansas City, KS). Two strongly hybridized cosmids, pLEE10 and pWFI16, were identified and found to be overlapping by subsequent restriction analysis. A 6300-bp XbaI fragment from the cosmid pWFI16 harboring the ppoA gene was subcloned to pBluescript SK- (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) generating the plasmid pDIT1.1. Cosmid pWFI16 and plasmid pDIT1.1 were used as templates to sequence the entire ORF of the ppoA gene as well as ∼1500 bp of the 5′- and the 3′-untranslated flanking regions in both DNA strands. The ppoA gene has been deposited in the GenBank™ data base under accession number AY502073. Total RNA was extracted from 24-h liquid shake cultures from strain RDIT9.32 for ppoA cDNA. mRNA was purified using the Oligotex mRNA isolation kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase-PCR using rapid amplification of cDNA ends technology and the Gene Racer kit (Invitrogen) following the supplier's protocols. ppoA primers and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) were used to amplify the ppoA fragments that were subcloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Sequencing analysis of the resulting clones was performed to determine the cDNA sequence of the ppoA. The ppoA deletion plasmid pDIT3.11, including the metG marker gene and ppoA flanking sequences without the ppoA encoding region, was created as follows. First, the primers ppoA-5DF3 and ppoA-5DR1 were used to PCR-amplify a 1100-bp flanking region at the 5′-untranslated region of the ppoA ORF using the cosmid pWFI16 as template. ppoA-5DF3 and ppoA-5DR1 were designed to introduce XbaI and XmaI restriction sites at either side of the PCR fragment, respectively. The amplified XbaI-XmaI product was subcloned into pBluescript SK- yielding the vector pDIT2. Next, the primers ppoA-3DF1 and ppoA-3DR1 were used to amplify the flanking region at the 3′-untranslated region of the ppoA ORF using the cosmid pWFI16 as template. ppoA-3DF1 and ppoA-3DR1 were designed to introduce SphI and KpnI restriction sites at either side of the PCR fragment, respectively. Finally, the amplified SphI-KpnI 3′-flanking region and the 2470-bp XmaI-SphI fragment from the pUG11–41, containing the A. nidulans metG cassette (23Sienko M. Paszewski A. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), were ligated at the same time into the XmaI-KpnI sites of the pDIT2. The resulting disruption vector pDIT3.11 was used to transform the A. nidulans strain pW1 to methionine prototrophy, creating the transformant TDIT2.9 where the entire ppoA coding region was deleted. Gene replacement and ectopic integration were confirmed by PCR and Southern analysis. The ΔppoA allele was introduced in a veA background by sexual recombination of TDIT2.9 with RDIT2.30 to give the prototrophs RDIT12.1 and RDIT12.9. The vector pDIT19.4 was used to complement the ppoA deletion strain RTMK22.28. The plasmid pDIT19.4 was created by inserting a 6300-bp XmaI-NotI fragment from the plasmid pDIT1.1 containing the promoter, the coding sequence and the termination cassette of ppoA, into pJW53. 2J-W. Bok and N. P. Keller, unpublished data. pJW53 contains an 1800-bp fragment of the 5′ portion of the A. nidulans pyridoxine biosynthetic gene (pyroA), which can complement the pyroA4 mutation by single crossing over. The pyridoxine prototroph TDIT8.1 containing the ppoA::pyroA allele was isolated. RDIT83.1 and RDIT83.2 are the prototrophic meiotic progeny of the cross between TDIT8.1 and RDIT55.27. To overexpress the ppoA gene, modified primers ppoA-F15-KpnI and ppoA-R18-KpnI were used to PCR amplify the region of the ppoA locus from pWFI16. The resulting 4000-bp KpnI fragment spanning the region 55-bp upstream of the start codon to the polyadenylation site was subcloned into both pRB1 (24Yu J.H. Butchko R.A. Fernandes M. Keller N.P. Leonard T.J. Adams T.H. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and pDIT8.4 generating the plasmids pDIT10.9 and pDIT11.3, respectively. pRB1 contains a 1750-kb fragment of the 5′ portion of the A. nidulans trpC gene, which complements the trpC801 mutation, and niiA(p), the nitrite reductase promoter, which is suppressed by ammonium and induced by nitrate. pDIT8.4 was created by replacing the NotI-NcoI fragment containing the niiA promoter from pRB1 with an amplified NotI-NcoI fragment of the A. nidulans constitutively expressed glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter gpdA (25Punt P.J. Zegers N.D. Busscher M. Pouwels P.H. van den Hondel C.A. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 17: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The gpdA(p) was PCR amplified using the modified primers gpdA-5-NotI and gpdA-3-NcoI from pAN52.3 (25Punt P.J. Zegers N.D. Busscher M. Pouwels P.H. van den Hondel C.A. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 17: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). pDIT10.9 and pDIT11.3 were introduced into RDIT30.92 and RDIT30.12, respectively. Tryptophan prototrophs containing the niiA(p)::ppoA or the gpdA(p)::ppoA construct were isolated based on PCR and Southern analysis and named TDIT4.2 and TDIT5.8, respectively. The niiA(p)::ppoA and the gpdA(p)::ppoA alleles were introduced in a ΔppoA; veA background by sexual recombination of TDIT4.2 with RTMK22.16 and TDI5.8 with RDIT22.16 to give the prototrophs RDIT75.24 and RDIT81.10. Overexpression of ppoA (OE::ppoA) was also confirmed by gene transcript analysis. The sgfp-ppoA fusion protein (sgfp = synthetic green fluorescent protein) (26Zolotukhin S. Potter M. Hauswirth W.W. Guy J. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4646-4654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was constructed in two steps. First, primers NGPPOA-5′GFP and NGPPOA-3′GFP, constructed with KpnI and SphI sites, respectively, were used to amplify a 740-bp fragment encoding sGFP from the plasmid pPRgf-T4 (kindly provided from C. Cortez). Second, modified primers NGPPOA-5′ppoA and ppoA-R18 amplified a 4125-bp SphI-KpnI ppoA PCR product from pWFI16. Finally the KpnI-SphI gfp fragment and the SphI-KpnI ppoA fragment were ligated into the KpnI-digested pDIT8.4 vector adjacent to the gpdA(p). The generated plasmid, pDIT17.1, had the 1100-bp fragment of the 5′ portion of the A. nidulans trpC gene next to the gpdA(p)::gfp-ppoA allele. The GFP construct was inserted by transformation as a single ectopic integration into the A. nidulans trpC locus of the strain RDIT30.23 yielding the transformant TDIT7.3. A sexual cross between TDIT7.3 and RDIT12.15 led to the meiotic prototrophic progeny RDIT71.8. The fusion construct gpdA(p)::gfp-ppoA was further confirmed by gene transcript analysis. The plasmid pCV10 carrying the gpdA(p)::gfp fusion was introduced into the A. nidulans RDIT 55.31 strain yielding the transformant TDIT9.14 that used as control in the GFP experiments. Lipid Extraction and Fatty Acid Analysis—Wild type, ΔppoA and ppoA overexpression strains were grown in 25 ml of liquid GMM in Petri dishes under stationary conditions at 37 °C in the dark. Mycelial mats were collected after 72 h, freeze-dried, weighed, and homogenized mechanically using Ultra-Turrax® T25 dispenser (Ika Werke GmbH & Co. KG). Lipids were extracted and converted into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) derivatives using 2% sulfuric acid in methanol as described elsewhere (27Browse J. McCourt P.J. Somerville C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). FAME were converted into corresponding trimethylsilyl ether (OTMSi) derivatives using N′,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (Supelco, 33154-U) as a silylation agent according to the method reported previously (28Zarnowski R. Suzuki Y. Esumi Y. Pietr S.J. Phytochemistry. 2000; 55: 975-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Samples were dissolved in 200 μl of hexane/chloroform (4:1) and stored at -20 °C until further laboratory analyses. OTMSi-FAME was analyzed by flame ionization detectiongas chromatography and GC-electron impact/MS as described by Ghanevati and Jaworski (29Ghanevati M. Jaworski J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3531-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). FAME were analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph fitted with a 30-m J&W DB-225 capillary column (Agilent, Palo Alta, CA) and connected to a double flame ionization detector set at 300 °C. GC/MS measurements were made with a KRATOS Analytical (Manchester, UK) MS 25 RFA mass spectrometer equipped with a Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy) Model 5160 gas chromatograph. A J&W Scientific (Folsom, CA) fused-silica capillary GC column (30 mm × 0.32 mm I.D.) with DB-5MS coating (0.25 μm) was used. Nonadecanoic acid (19:0) was used as an internal standard. Fatty acids were identified by comparison of retention times with a set of authentic fatty acid standards, whereas 8-hydroxyoleic (8-HOE) and 8-hydroxylinoleic (8-HODE) acids were identified by mass spectrometry on the basis of their fragmentation patterns (11Calvo A.M.

Lipids. 2000; 35: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Physiological Studies—All strains used for physiological studies were prototrophic. The wild type RDIT9.32 was a prototrophic meiotic progeny of a sexual cross between WIM126 and RDIT1.7. Asexual and sexual spore production studies were performed on plates containing 30 ml of solid 1.5% GMM or YGT media. GMM is a medium known to promote the asexual spore stage, and YGT medium has been used in previous research to promote sexual development in A. nidulans (9Champe S.P. Rao P. Chang A. J. Gen.

Five milliliters of the top layer with cool melted 0.7% agar-GMM or YGT that contained 106 conidia of the appropriate strain was added on each plate. Cultures were incubated in continuous dark or light at 37 °C. A core of 12.5-mm diameter was removed from each plate at the appropriate time interval and homogenized for 1 min in 3 ml of sterile water supplemented with 0.01% Tween 80 to release the spores. Spores were counted using a hemacytometer. The experiments were performed with four replicates. Induction of niiA promoter was performed as described previously (24Yu J.H. Butchko R.A. Fernandes M.

https://openalex.org/W2116988943,"Eukaryotic cells have developed mechanisms for regulating the nuclear transport of macromolecules that control various cellular events including movement through defined stages of the cell cycle. In yeast cells, where the nuclear envelope remains intact throughout the cell cycle, these transport regulatory mechanisms must also function during mitosis. We have uncovered a mechanism for regulating transport that is controlled by M phase specific molecular rearrangements in the nuclear pore complex (NPC). These changes allow a transport inhibitory nucleoporin, Nup53p, to bind the karyopherin Kap121p specifically during mitosis, slowing its movement through the NPC and inducing cargo release. Yeast strains that possess defects in the function of Kap121p or the fidelity of the inhibitory pathway are delayed in mitosis. We propose that fluctuations in Kap121p transport mediated by the NPC contribute to controlling the subcellular distribution of molecules that direct progression through mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2072721016,"Apoptin has been described to induce apoptosis in various human cancer cell lines, but not in normal cells, thus making it an interesting candidate for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Apoptin was generated and cloned into several mammalian expression vectors. Transfection or microinjection of apoptin cDNA resulted in its expression, initially in the cytoplasm with a filamentous pattern. Subsequently, apoptin entered the nucleus and efficiently induced apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. Nuclear localization was shown to be required for induction of apoptosis. Apoptin expression level was found to be an important determinant of the efficiency of induction of apoptosis. Surprisingly, expression of apoptin or GFP-apoptin cDNA induced apoptosis in some normal cells. When fused to the HIV-TAT protein transduction domain and delivered as a protein, TAT-apoptin was transduced efficiently (>90%) into normal and tumour cells. However, TAT-apoptin remained in the cytoplasm and did not kill normal 6689 and 1BR3 fibroblasts. In contrast TAT-apoptin migrated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of Saos-2 and HSC-3 cancer cells resulting in apoptosis after 24 h. This study shows that apoptin is a powerful apoptosis-inducing protein with a potential for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2040278047,"Lipid accumulation in pancreatic β-cells is thought to cause its dysfunction and/or destruction via apoptosis. Our studies show that incubation of the β-cell line RINm5F with the saturated free fatty acids (FFA) palmitate caused apoptosis based on increases in caspase 3 activity, Annexin V staining, and cell death. Furthermore, exposure of RINm5F cells to cAMP-increasing agents, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and forskolin completely abolished palmitate-mediated caspase 3 activity and significantly inhibited Annexin V staining and cell death. The cyclic AMP analogs cpt-cAMP and dibutyryl-cAMP mimicked the protective effects of IBMX and forskolin, suggesting that cAMP is the mediator of the anti-apoptotic effects. The protective action of IBMX and forskolin was rapid and did not appear to require gene transcription or new protein synthesis. However, these protective effects were clearly independent of protein kinase A (PKA) because of the lack of inhibition by the PKA inhibitors H-89 and KT5720. In attempts to identify this PKA-independent mechanism, we found that the newly developed cAMP analog 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, which selectively activates the cAMP-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange factor (cAMP-GEF) pathway, mimicked the protective effects of IBMX and forskolin, suggesting that the cAMP-GEF pathway is involved. In addition, both glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and its receptor agonist, Exenatide, inhibited palmitate-mediated caspase 3 activation in a dose-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, H-89 partially reversed the protective effects of GLP-1 and Exenatide, suggesting that PKA may play a role in the protective effects of these incretins. To explain these seemingly conflicting results, we demonstrated that low concentrations of cAMP produced by GLP-1 and Exenatide preferentially activate the PKA pathway, whereas higher cAMP concentrations produced by IBMX and forskolin activate the more dominant cAMP-GEF pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that intracellular concentrations of cAMP may play a key role in determining divergent signaling pathways that lead to antiapoptotic responses.

Cancer Invest. 2002; 20: 972-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Sandal T. Stapnes C. Kleivdal H. Hedin L. Koskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20783-20793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that cAMP can cause both apoptotic and antiapoptotic effects depending on the cell type and triggering stimulus. The antiapoptotic effects of cAMP on lipotoxicity, however, have not been previously reported. The activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by cAMP is a classical cellular signaling pathway that regulates a variety of cellular responses. The specificity of this regulation by cAMP is provided by protein kinase A-anchoring proteins that target its receptor, PKA, to specific cellular locations (9Harada H. Becknell B. Wilm M. Mann M. Huang L.J.-S. Taylor S.S. Scott J.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). It has been shown that mitochondria-anchored PKA inactivates the proapoptotic factor BAD through phosphorylation in response to the survival cytokine interleukin-3. Interleukin-3-induced phosphorylation of BAD was blocked by the PKA inhibitors Rp-cAMP and H-89 consistent with anchored PKA as the principal kinase (9Harada H. Becknell B. Wilm M. Mann M. Huang L.J.-S. Taylor S.S. Scott J.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that cAMP causes an even broader range of cellular responses by activating signaling pathways that are independent of PKA. Cyclic AMP has been shown to regulate gene transcription, cellular proliferation, and cytokine signaling through PKA-independent pathways (10Gasperini S. Crepaldi L. Calzetti F. Gatto L. Berlato C. Bazzoni F. Yoshimura A. Cassatella M.A. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2002; 13: 47-53PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hamelink C. Lee H.W. Chen Y. Grimaldi M. Eiden L.E. J.

Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A novel PKA-independent pathway that is activated by cAMP involves the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs also designated as Epac) for the small GTPases Rap1 and Rap2. It has been demonstrated that cAMP-GEFs directly activate Rap1, which is clearly independent of PKA (14de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar, 15Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. M. G.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of the activation of Rap1 by the cAMP-GEF pathway are not fully understood. The recent development of a novel cAMP analog, 8-(chloro-phenylthio)-2′-O-methyl-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8CPT-2Me-cAMP), which activates cAMP-GEF, but not PKA, has been used to identify the cAMP-GEF signaling pathway (16Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two isoforms of GEF have been identified, GEF-1 and GEF-2, and pancreatic islets and β-cell lines express both isoforms (17Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Chepurny O. Habener J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The cAMP-GEF pathway has been previously shown to regulate incretin-potentiated insulin secretion (18Kashima Y. Miki T. Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It is postulated that cAMP binds to GEF, and the cAMP-GEF complex activates Rap1, a ubiquitously expressed GTPase of the Ras superfamily. Both Ras and Rap1 can exist in an inactive GDP-bound form or an active GTP-bound form, and cAMP-GEF promotes the formation of the active GTP-bound form of GTPase. Although the precise function of Rap1 is not known, it is believed to exhibit both Ras-dependent and -independent cellular functions. Recent studies suggest that the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase proliferation signaling pathway may regulate GLP-1-mediated β-cell growth and proliferation (17Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Chepurny O. Habener J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also indicates that Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release is regulated by the cAMP-GEF pathway in the β-cell line, INS-1 (19Kang G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. 2002; 546: 175-189Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the ability of incretins to potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from isolated mouse islets involves both a PKA-dependent pathway and a PKA-independent pathway. The PKA-independent pathway involves the interaction of GEF-2 and Rim2, an insulin granule-associated protein (18Kashima Y. Miki T. Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a 300-amino acid peptide secreted from L-cells of the intestinal epithelium in response to food (20Farilla L. Hui H. Bertolotto C. Kang E. Bulotta A. Di Mario U. Perfetti R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4397-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). GLP-1 is one of the most potent insulinotropic substances known with half-maximal effective concentrations around 10 pmol/liter (21Holst J.J. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2002; 18: 430-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and a strict requirement for glucose concentrations above 4.5 mmol/liter (22Weir G.C. Mojsov S. Hendrick G.K. Habener J.F. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 338-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GLP-1 mediates its effects by binding to cell surface receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins, which are expressed by pancreatic β-cells. The binding of GLP-1 to its receptor stimulates cAMP formation, activation of PKA-dependent and -independent pathways, and a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (23Fehmann H.-C. Goke R. Goke B. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 390-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 24Holz G.G. Leech C.A. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). GLP-1 has been shown to be effective in normalizing fasting glucose levels of type 2 diabetic patients resistant to diet and sulfonylurea therapy (25Nauck M.A. Kleine N. Orskov C. Holst J.J. Willms B. Creutzfeldt W. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). GLP-1 has also been shown to improve glucose control in ZDF rats by increasing islet cell proliferation and decreasing cellular apoptosis (20Farilla L. Hui H. Bertolotto C. Kang E. Bulotta A. Di Mario U. Perfetti R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4397-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The extensive and rapid degradation of GLP-1 after subcutaneous injection, however, limits its usage as a therapeutic agent. A number of strategies to prolong the half-life of GLP-1 are currently being explored. The GLP-1 receptor agonist, Exenatide, exhibits a longer half-life than GLP-1 because of its resistance to the ubiquitously expressed enzyme, dipeptidyl peptidase IV. In this study, we have developed an in vitro model of palmitate-induced apoptosis of the β-cell line RINm5F and demonstrated that cAMP-increasing agents including IBMX and forskolin and the G protein-coupled receptor agonists GLP-1 and Exenatide provide protection in both a PKA- and cAMP-GEF-dependent manner. Low concentrations of cAMP produced by GLP-1 and Exenatide preferentially activate the PKA pathway, whereas higher cAMP concentrations produced by IBMX and forskolin activate the more dominate cAMP-GEF pathway. These findings suggest that modulation of cAMP concentrations may provide a strategy to optimize antiapoptotic signaling pathways. Materials—Tissue culture medium, CMRL-1066, was obtained from Invitrogen. Penicillin, streptomycin, Hanks’ balanced salt solution, l-glutamine, and the insulinoma cell line RINm5F were obtained from the Washington University Tissue Culture Support Center. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). BSA (fraction V, fatty acid-free) was from ICN Biomedical (Irvine, CA). Palmitic acid, IBMX, forskolin, and GLP-1 were obtained from Sigma. DEVD-AMC, cpt-cAMP, dibutyryl-cAMP, and KT5720 were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and Annexin V-FITC was from BD Biosciences Phar-Mingen (San Diego, CA). Direct cAMP enzyme immunoassay kits were obtained from Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, MI). H-89 was obtained from Alexis (San Diego, CA), and 8CPT-2Me-cAMP was from the BioLog Life Sci. Institute (Bremen, Germany). Exenatide was a kind gift from Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (San Diego, CA) and Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). BSA Complexed FFA Concentrations—Fatty acid supplemented medium was prepared as described previously (26Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14890-14895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 20 mm solution of fatty acid in 0.01 n NaOH was incubated at 70 °C for 30 min with mixing. The dropwise addition of 1 n NaOH facilitated solubilization of FFA. Fatty acid soaps were complexed with 5% fatty acid-free BSA in phosphate-buffered saline. The BSA complexed fatty acid was added to 10% serum-containing cell culture medium to achieve desired total fatty acid concentrations at a 6.6:1 fatty acid to BSA molar ratio. The pH of the medium did not differ significantly from the addition of BSA complexed fatty acids, and unbound free fatty acids remained solubilized under all experimental conditions. These conditions were chosen to model pathophysiologic states in which FFA:BSA molar ratios approach 7:1 and yield unbound FFA concentrations in the several hundred nanomolar range (26Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14890-14895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Expression of Full-length FATP1 cDNA—RINm5F cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and a final glucose concentration of 16.8 mm. RINm5F cells (105) were transduced in a 35-mm well by two successive 7-h exposures to 1 ml of a virus containing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged murine FATP1 cDNA (ΔU3FATP1) prepared as described previously (27Lewis S.E. Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37042-37050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). FATP1-overexpressing RINm5F cells showed an approximate 4–5-fold increase in fatty acid uptake, elevation in lipid accumulation, and higher apoptotic cell death as compared with control cells. The overexpression of FATP1 did not interfere with RINm5F cell growth in normal culture media. In addition, the parameters of nutrient-mediated activation of metabolism based on MTS assays and protein translation monitored by p70s6k activation were similar in FATP1-overexpressing RINm5F cells in comparison with nontransfected control and LacZ cells. FATP1-overexpressing β-cells were used to optimize palmitate-induced apoptosis over shorter exposure periods in these in vitro studies compared with control RINm5F cells. Control and Lac Z RINm5F cells also showed stimulated caspase 3 activity in response to palmitate treatment, and the cAMP-increasing agents forskolin and IBMX completely inhibited palmitate-mediated apoptosis as in FATP1-overexpressing cells. However, the magnitude of caspase 3 activation in response to palmitate treatment was smaller than FATP1-overexpressing RINm5F cells. Apoptosis Assays—For fluorescent caspase 3 cleavage assays, the cells (3 × 105) were plated in a 24-well plate. After treatment with palmitate, the cells were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed with 160 μl of Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 42 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μm leupeptin). Triplicate cell lysates (50 μl) were transferred to a 96-well plate. Buffer B (150 μl; 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, and 3 mm dithiothreitol) containing 10 μm DEVD-AMC was added to the cell lysates and incubated at room temperature for 20 min in the dark. The plate was read at excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. For linearity, the plate was read every 2 min for 90 min, and the slope was determined. A comparison of caspase 3 activities under different experimental conditions was made only within an individual experiment because the measurement of absolute caspase 3 activity was not determined. Annexin V-FITC binding and propidium iodide staining were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptotic cells were defined as propidium iodide-negative (indicating an intact plasma membrane) and as Annexin V-FITC-positive in comparison with cells incubated in the absence of palmitate. Cell Viability Assays—After experimental treatment, both floating and attached cells were harvested and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and cell viability assays were performed. The cells were counted using a hemacytometer (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA) after mixing with trypan blue in a 1:1 ratio. Assay of Phosphorylated and Total cAMP Response Element-binding Protein (CREB)—The cells (3 × 106) were plated and cultured overnight in 35-mm Petri dishes. The cells were then pretreated for 30 min with H-89 (10 μm), followed by stimulation with forskolin (10 μm) for 10 min. The cells were washed once in 1× phosphate-buffered solution, solubilized with boiling SDS sample buffer, subjected to electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Anti-phosphorylated CREB and anti-CREB antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) were used following the manufacturer’s recommendations and detected by chemiluminescence using an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antirabbit antibody. cAMP Assays—Cells (3 × 105) were plated in a 24-well plate. After experimental treatment, incubation media were aspirated and placed in microcentrifuge tubes. The cells were lysed by the addition of 500 μl of 0.1 n HCl containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The lysed cells were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes. The samples were centrifuged at 1300 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Cyclic AMP concentrations in these supernatants were determined with a direct enzyme immunoassay kit as described by the manufacturer. Cyclic AMP concentrations in the culture media were also determined. The total concentration of 5 cAMP produced by each condition was obtained by adding cellular and culture media cAMP contents. Statistics—Statistical comparisons were made between groups using a one-way analysis of variance. Significant differences were evaluated using Tukey post hoc analysis. Cyclic AMP Protects RINm5F Cells from Palmitate-mediated Apoptosis—In this in vitro model, we have demonstrated that incubation of the β-cell line RINm5F with the saturated FFA palmitate causes an increase in apoptosis based on caspase 3 activity, Annexin V staining, and assays of cell death. The concentration dependence of this effect indicated that 300 μm palmitate complexed with BSA in a ratio of 6.6:1 (FFA:BSA) for 12 h caused an optimal increase in the number of β-cells undergoing apoptosis (data not shown). Under these experimental conditions, the free or unbound FFA concentration is estimated to be in the several hundred nanomolar range (26Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14890-14895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, incubation of RINm5F cells with palmitate and the cAMP-increasing agents IBMX (100 μm) and forskolin (10 μm) completely prevented palmitate-mediated increases in caspase 3 activity. In a similar manner, IBMX and forskolin also significantly prevented, albeit to a lesser degree, palmitate-mediated increases in Annexin V staining and cell death as shown in Fig. 1 (B and C). The cyclic AMP analogs, chlorophenylthio-cAMP (cpt-cAMP; 200 μm) or dibutyryl-cAMP (1 mm) mimicked the effects of IBMX and forskolin, suggesting that the action of IBMX and forskolin is mediated by increases in intracellular cAMP (Fig. 2). Direct measurements of cAMP concentrations under these identical conditions have also been performed as shown in Table I. IBMX and forskolin stimulated cAMP production ∼100-fold higher than control and palmitate conditions. The specific concentrations of IBMX, forskolin, and the cAMP analogs employed in these experiments were selected based on dose-response studies (data not shown).Fig. 2cAMP analogs mimic the protective effects of IBMX + forskolin on palmitate-mediated apoptosis. RINm5F cells were incubated in control medium or medium containing 300 μm palmitate, palmitate + IBMX (100 μm) + forskolin (10 μm), palmitate + cpt-cAMP (200 μm), or palmitate + dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP, 1 mm) for 12 h. After treatment, caspase 3 assays were performed. The results are representative of three individual experiments.

As shown in Fig. 3, palmitate-mediated increases in caspase 3 activity were completely prevented by exposure of RINm5F cells to cAMP-increasing agents present for the duration of a 12-h incubation period. The addition of IBMX and forskolin to the culture media 1 h prior to the end of a 12-h incubation with palmitate was sufficient to cause a significant decrease in caspase 3 activity. These findings suggest that the effects of IBMX and forskolin are rapid and probably do not require gene transcription or new protein synthesis. These cAMP-increasing agents were also added after the 12-h incubation period with palmitate and processed for caspase 3 activity. This condition did not result in inhibition of palmitate-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that IBMX and forskolin did not interfere with the measurement of caspase 3 activity. The Protective Effects of IBMX and Forskolin Are Dependent on cAMP-GEF and Independent of PKA—The involvement of PKA activation by cAMP was studied using two PKA inhibitors, H-89 and KT5720. As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), various doses of H-89 (1–50 μm) or KT5720 (0.1–10 μm) did not reverse the inhibitory effects of IBMX and forskolin on palmitate-mediated caspase 3 activity. In the absence of either palmitate or IBMX + forskolin, neither H-89 nor KT5720 affected basal levels of caspase 3 activity (Fig. 4, white columns). To show that H-89 was able to inhibit PKA in intact cells, its ability to block cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation of CREB was examined. As shown in Fig. 5, H-89 (10 μm) was able to inhibit forskolin-stimulated phosphorylation of CREB to basal levels. These studies suggest that the protective effects of these cAMP-increasing agents are independent of PKA activation.Fig. 5H-89 inhibits forskolin-mediated phosphorylation of CREB. RINm5F cells (3 × 106) were preincubated in the absence (lane 2) or presence (lane 3) of H-89 (10 μm), followed by stimulation with forskolin (10 μm) for 10 min (lanes 2 and 3). Lane 1 contains untreated cells. The level of phosphorylation of CREB was estimated using anti-phosphorylated CREB and anti-CREB antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recent studies have shown that cAMP directly activates the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (cAMP-GEF) pathway in a PKA-independent manner (14de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). The novel cAMP agonist, 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, designed to selectively activate the cAMP-GEF pathway but not PKA, was used to determine whether this signaling pathway is involved in the protective effects of IBMX and forskolin on palmitate-mediated apoptosis. Fig. 6 shows that 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (10 and 100 μm) completely prevented palmitate-mediated caspase 3 activity, suggesting that the cAMP-GEF pathway may be involved in the protective action of IBMX and forskolin on palmitate-mediated apoptosis. GLP-1 and Its Receptor Agonist, Exenatide, Prevent Palmitate-mediated Apoptosis—GLP-1 has been shown to decrease β-cell apoptosis in ZDF rats (20Farilla L. Hui H. Bertolotto C. Kang E. Bulotta A. Di Mario U. Perfetti R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4397-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Based on our studies indicating that cAMP prevents palmitate-mediated apoptosis, we determined next whether the ability of GLP-1 to decrease apoptosis in ZDF islets may be due, in part, to increases in cAMP levels that directly regulate the cAMP-GEF pathway. RINm5F cells were treated with palmitate and increasing concentrations of GLP-1 or its receptor agonist, Exenatide. As shown in Fig. 7, both GLP-1 and Exenatide provided significant protection from palmitate-mediated caspase 3 activation. This protection by GLP-1 and Exenatide occurred in a concentration-dependent manner and maximally reduced the caspase 3 activity to ∼65% of its activity in the presence of palmitate alone. GLP-1 or Exenatide alone did not alter basal caspase activity as indicated by the white columns. Experiments were next performed to determine whether the ability of GLP-1 or Exenatide to provide protection against palmitate-induced apoptosis is due to activation of the cAMP-GEF pathway similar to the effects of IBMX and forskolin. Unexpectedly, an inhibitor of PKA, H-89 (1 and 10 μm), almost completely reversed GLP-1-mediated (1 μm) and Exenatide-mediated (100 nm) protection against apoptosis as shown in Fig. 8. To understand these seemingly conflicting results, we hypothesized that cAMP may activate both PKA and cAMP-GEF pathways depending on its concentration. To test this hypothesis, RINm5F cells were incubated with two different concentrations of forskolin (1 and 10 μm) or Exenatide, in the presence of palmitate, to determine whether these treatments could invoke different concentrations of intracellular cAMP. Fig. 9A indicates that 1 and 10 μm forskolin (third and fourth columns) indeed resulted in dose-dependent increases in cAMP. Moreover, Exenatide (fifth column) and GLP-1 (data not shown) stimulated cAMP production to a level similar to 1 μm forskolin. As shown in Fig. 9B (fourth and sixth columns), forskolin at 1 and 10 μm also resulted in a concentration-dependent protection of RINm5F cells against palmitate-mediated apoptosis. In addition, 1 μm forskolin-mediated protection was readily reversed by H-89 (Fig. 9B, fifth column), whereas 10 μm forskolin-mediated protection was not (Fig. 9B, seventh column), suggesting that cAMP activates these different signaling pathways in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, lower concentrations of cAMP produced by 1 μm forskolin stimulate the PKA pathway, which is reversed by H-89, whereas the higher concentrations of cAMP produced by 10 μm forskolin stimulate the cAMP-GEF pathway, which is PKA-independent.Fig. 9Reversibility of cAMP-mediated protection by H-89 depends on the concentration of cAMP.A, RINm5F cells (3 × 105) were treated with various conditions as indicated for 12 h. After treatment, cAMP concentrations were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, to determine whether the reversibility by H-89 depends on the concentrations of intracellular cAMP, RINm5F cells (3 × 105) were incubated with medium as indicated for 12 h as previously described, followed by caspase 3 assays. The results are the averages of four individual experiments. The asterisk denotes a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) between the indicated columns. Pal, palmitate; For, forskolin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The dose-dependent activation by cAMP of two different cellular signaling pathways has been confirmed using Exenatide in the absence or presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX. As shown in Fig. 9A, Exenatide (100 nm) stimulated cAMP production at a level similar to forskolin (1 μm). The presence of IBMX in addition to Exenatide increases intracellular cAMP levels about 2-fold compared with Exenatide alone (data not shown). Although cAMP levels stimulated by Exenatide as shown in Fig. 9A are not as high as those stimulated by forskolin (10 μm), these lower levels appear to be sufficient to further enhance the protective effects of Exenatide against apoptosis as shown in Fig. 10A (fifth column). In Fig. 10A, IBMX (sixth column) or Exenatide (fourth column) alone protected palmitate-mediated apoptosis ∼25–30%. However, when these agents were combined (fifth column), the protection was further enhanced to ∼75%. To further support our findings that different cAMP levels activate alternative downstream signaling pathways, studies were performed with Exenatide as described in Fig. 10A but in the presence of the PKA inhibitor, H-89. As shown in Fig. 10B, H-89 (10 μm) readily reversed Exenatide-mediated protection (fourth and fifth columns) against palmitate-induced apoptosis. In contrast, a combination of Exenatide and IBMX (sixth and seventh columns) that results in increased cAMP levels produced almost complete protection that was not reversed by H-89. Our studies have demonstrated that palmitic acid induces apoptosis in the β-cell line RINm5F, and intracellular concentrations of cAMP exert a key role in modulating antiapoptotic responses. In this in vitro design, activation of caspase 3 activity provided greater sensitivity in assessing palmitate-mediated apoptosis than Annexin V or cell viability based on trypan blue staining. In the course of these studies, we observed that the cAMP-increasing agents IBMX and forskolin completely prevented palmitate-mediated apoptosis of the β-cell line RINm5F. The protective action of IBMX and forskolin was rapid and did not require prolonged incubations, suggesting that gene transcription or new protein synthesis was not involved. Although increases in cAMP concentrations augment nutrient stimulation of insulin secretion from β-cells, alterations in insulin concentrations in the incubation media failed to affect palmitate-mediated apoptosis (data not shown). Furthermore, different concentrations of glucose did not alter the protective effects of cAMP against palmitate-mediated apoptosis (data not shown). Separate experiments demonstrated that forskolin alone was almost as effective as the combination of IBMX and forskolin, and IBMX alone provided an intermediate level of protection based on this same comparison (data not shown). In this latter condition, it is believed that IBMX alone increases basal cAMP levels because of its ability to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity. Increases in intracellular levels of cAMP appeared to mediate the protective effects of IBMX and forskolin because the cAMP analogs cpt-cAMP and dibutyryl-cAMP also provided complete protection from palmitate-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, control studies indicated that these cAMP-increasing agents did not interfere with the caspase 3 activity measurements. Because PKA is a well established effector of cAMP that mediates prosurvival signaling, we examined the ability of the PKA inhibitors H-89 and KT5720 to reverse this protective action of cAMP against palmitate-mediated apoptosis. The inability of these two structurally unrelated PKA inhibitors to reverse palmitate-mediated apoptosis suggested that this protective action of cAMP occurred in a PKA-independent manner. Interestingly, de Rooij et al. (14de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) reported that forskolin and cAMP activate Rap1, a small Ras-like GTPase, also in a PKA-independent manner. These investigators determined that cAMP directly activates a GEF (also designated as Epac) that in turn activates Rap1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells. More recently, Kang et al. (28Kang G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8279-8285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) reported that cAMP triggers Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in pancreatic β-cells through activation of cAMP-GEF in a PKA-independent manner. These findings were accomplished, in part, by the use of a newly developed cAMP analog, 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, that selectively activates the cAMP-GEF pathway (16Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that this selective cAMP analog for the cAMP-GEF pathway mimicked the ability of cAMP-increasing agents to provide complete protection from palmitate-induced apoptosis. This protection by 8CPT-2Me-cAMP also occurred over a similar concentration range in which 8CPT-2Me-cAMP did not activate PKA signaling mechanisms involving CREB in the β-cell line, INS-1, as reported by Kang et al. (28Kang G. Joseph J.W. Chepurny O.G. Monoco M. Wheeler M.B. Bos J.L. Schwede F. Genieser H.-G. Holz G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8279-8285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also indicated that the cAMP-GEF signaling pathway exerts a critical role in GLP-1-potentiated insulin secretion by β-cells (29Tsuboi T. Silva Xavier G. Holz G.G. Jouaville L.S. Thomas A.P. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition to its insulinotropic effects, GLP-1 has also been reported to promote islet cell growth and to inhibit apoptosis in ZDF rats (20Farilla L. Hui H. Bertolotto C. Kang E. Bulotta A. Di Mario U. Perfetti R. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4397-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Our studies have shown that GLP-1 and its receptor agonist, Exenatide, also provided a significant degree of protection in a concentration-dependent manner against palmitate-mediated apoptosis of the β-cell line, RINm5F (Fig. 6). The lack of complete protection in comparison with IBMX and forskolin (10 μm) is believed to be due to the reduced concentrations of cAMP produced by these incretins (Fig. 8A). Paradoxically, the protection provided by GLP-1 or Exenatide against palmitate-mediated apoptosis was almost completely reversed by H-89, suggesting that a PKA-dependent pathway is involved in the protective actions of incretins unlike those of forskolin. A possible mechanism to explain these divergent findings is that the intracellular concentrations of cAMP generated by GLP-1 or its receptor agonist, Exenatide, in comparison with the cAMP-increasing agent, forskolin, may determine the signaling pathways that lead to antiapoptotic responses. In support of this mechanism, low concentrations of cAMP produced by 1 μm forskolin or Exenatide (Fig. 9) appeared to activate the PKA pathway, which was reversed by H-89. In contrast, an approximately 3-fold higher concentration of cAMP produced by 10 μm forskolin activated the more dominant cAMP-GEF pathway, which was not inhibited by H-89. This proposed mechanism is further supported by the differences in affinities of cAMP for PKA activation with a Kd of ∼100 nm and a Kd of ∼10 μm for cAMP-GEF2 (18Kashima Y. Miki T. Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism based on intracellular cAMP concentrations has been proposed to explain a PKA-independent pathway involving the cAMP-GEF·Rim2 complex in the potentiation of insulin secretion by incretins (18Kashima Y. Miki T. Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our findings suggest that increasing intracellular concentrations of cAMP by using incretins in combination with specific phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Fig. 10A) may further enhance their antiapoptotic effects by activation of the cAMP-GEF pathway. A postulated mechanism to explain the antiapoptotic actions of GLP-1, Exenatide, and forskolin as described in these studies is shown in Fig. 11. The interaction of GLP-1 or Exenatide with its receptor activates heterotrimeric Gs proteins, leading to the dissociation of the Gαs subunit that subsequently stimulates adenylyl cyclase to produce cAMP. Cyclic AMP produced by this Gs-coupled receptor mechanism or by forskolin can activate either the PKA and/or cAMP-GEF pathway depending on its intracellular concentration. The specific downstream signaling mediators of the PKA or the cAMP-GEF pathway that are responsible for these antiapoptotic effects are currently unknown. An elucidation of this cellular mechanism and its relevance to FFA-induced apoptosis in primary β-cells is of importance to optimize conditions for β-cell growth and proliferation with minimal apoptosis."

The DMPO nitrone adducts were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) and immuno-spin trapping. The spin-trapped protein adducts were then subjected to tryptic digestion and MS analyses.

The nature of the radicals formed on hemoglobin was explored using proteolysis techniques followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses. The following sites of DMPO addition were identified on hemoglobin: Cys-93 of the β chain, and Tyr-42, Tyr-24, and His-20 of the α chain.

The role of free radicals in the pathogenesis of human disease has led to an increased interest in the study of free radicals and their reactions. Reactive oxygen metabolites can interact with cellular constituents, including DNA/RNA, proteins, and unsaturated lipids (1Janssen Y.M.W. Van Houten B. Borm P.J.A. Mossman B.T. Lab.

Previous studies have suggested that hemoproteins may be involved in redox reactions which contribute to tissue and/or organ damage via reaction with hydrogen peroxide (5Alayash A.I. Patel R.P. Cashon R.E. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Alayash A.I. Nat.

A recent study has reported evidence for the association of nitrotyrosine (which forms via tyrosyl radical) and coronary artery disease (8Shishehbor M.H. Aviles R.J. Brennan M.-L. Fu X. Goormastic M. Pearce G.L. Gokce N. Keaney Jr, J.F. Penn M.S. Sprecher D.L. Vita J.A. Hazen S.L. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2003; 289: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms of these reactions and their contributions to human diseases, it is important to determine the nature of heme protein radical intermediates involved in these processes. Protein-centered radicals have traditionally been studied through either direct electron spin resonance or by spin trapping (9Hawkins C.L. Davies M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 196-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Because most radicals are short-lived (i.e. microseconds to minutes), the spin trapping approach has been more widely used. With the spin trapping approach, protein radicals react with a spin trap molecule, such as 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane or 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), 1The abbreviations used are: DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide; Hb, hemoglobin; oxyHb, oxyferrous Hb; DTPA, diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; ESI, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. thereby making the radical more stable and, consequently, more long-lived. To take advantage of these more stable, trapped adducts, our research group recently reported the development of an antibody with specificity for the nitrone adduct, which is the final product of trapping radicals with DMPO (10Detweiler C.D. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Chignell C.F. Germolec D. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For this work, antibodies were raised against a DMPO derivative in which an octanoic acid side chain was conjugated to ovalbumin. Using this DMPO-specific antibody, we have demonstrated that the predominant protein radical formed in rat heart supernatant by hydrogen peroxide is myoglobin-derived (10Detweiler C.D. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Chignell C.F. Germolec D. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Assignment of the specific amino acid residue or residues that form radical adducts with the spin trap molecule is difficult with ESR or immunostaining. Consequently, researchers have used other biochemical techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and amino acid derivatization, to address these questions. These methods, however, suffer from potential drawbacks, such as the protein's stability and conformation can be perturbed by mutations and the formation of the amino acid radical and transfer of the radical is expected to be affected. Recently, mass spectrometry has been utilized to study protein free radicals (11Barr D.P. Gunther M.R. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. J. Biol.

English A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8655-8665Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The spin trap molecules form a covalent bond with the protein resulting in a new nitroxide radical, which may be stable under electrospray ionization mass spectrometry conditions. The one-electron oxidation product of this nitroxide is a stable nitrone with a covalent bond between DMPO and the original free radical (Scheme 1). In addition, the use of peptide mapping methodologies with mass spectrometry allows for the unequivocal assignment of the trapped radical on the protein. We are, therefore, using a combination of peptide mapping by mass spectrometry and the immuno-spin trapping technique to investigate the formation and structures of the protein radicals generated on heme-containing proteins. In a previous report using the immuno-spin trapping approach (16Ramirez D.C. Chen Y.-R. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that hemoglobin reacted with H2O2 in the presence of DMPO and suggested that the tyrosine residues and possibly a cysteine residue of hemoglobin are the sites of formation of the radical-derived nitrone adducts. The exposure of hemoproteins, such as hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb), to hydrogen peroxide has been shown to initially produce a porphyrin cation radical and ferryl ion. The porphyrin cation radical oxidizes one or more residues to form globin-centered radical(s) (16Ramirez D.C. Chen Y.-R. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol.

The exact site of this radical in hemoglobin has been speculated to be Tyr-42 on the α chain, based on x-ray data and the inhibition of the radical adduct signal by iodination of the tyrosine (18McArthur K.M. Davies M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Maples et al. (19Maples K.R. Kennedy C.H. Johnson S.J. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) reported the detection of a peroxide-dependent hemoglobinthiyl radical in rat and human hemoglobin and concluded, based on ESR parameters and the effect of thiol blocking agents, that the radical adduct was a thiyl radical adduct. In the presence of a spin trap, such as DMPO, the Hb-centered radical(s) yield a nitroxide radical adduct(s), which decays on the order of 1 min (22Kim Y.-M. Jeong S-H. Yamazaki I. Piette L.H. Han S. Hong S.-J. Free Radic. Res. 1995; 22: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This decay is the result of the oxidation of the nitroxide radical adduct to the corresponding globin radical-derived nitrone adduct by the ferryl moiety (Scheme 1). The globin radical-derived nitrone adduct can be investigated by immuno-spin trapping (16Ramirez D.C. Chen Y.-R. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the absence of a spin trap, the globin-centered radical(s) can decay by formation of cross links (23Thillet J. Michelson A.M. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1985; 1: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), such as dityrosine (24Guilivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24129-24136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and possibly other cross-links. To identify the precise amino acid residues trapped by the DMPO, we have utilized mass spectrometry-based sequencing. This approach includes proteolysis of the hemoglobin-derived DMPO adducts by trypsin, followed by MS peptide mapping, and finally MS/MS analyses of the peptides. Using this approach, we have identified the specific location of the DMPO adducts on hemoglobin and report our results here. Materials—Pure human oxyferrous Hb (oxyHb) was a kind gift of Apex Biosciences Inc. (Research Triangle Park, NC). Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) was purchased from Sigma. Beef liver catalase was purchased from Roche Applied Science and used as received. The spin trap DMPO was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA) and purified by double distillation at room temperature. The DMPO concentration was measured at 228 nm, assuming a molar absorption coefficient of 7800 m-1 cm-1 (25Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1990; 10: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Reagent grade 30% H2O2 was obtained from Fisher Scientific Co. The H2O2 concentration was verified using ϵ240 nm = 43.6 m-1 cm-1. All buffers were stored over Chelex 100® (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for 24 h followed by the addition of 100 μm DTPA to avoid possible transition metal-catalyzed reactions. Spin Trapping Reaction Conditions—Purified human oxyHb (oxyferrous form) was dissolved in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) treated with Chelex 100® and containing DTPA (100 μm). Before use, the oxyHb was passed through a prepacked Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mm phosphate buffer. For the SDS-PAGE and Western analyses, the reactions of oxyHb with H2O2 (H2O2:heme molar ratio equal to 10) were carried out in the presence of 100 mm DMPO in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 2 h. Reactions were stopped by consumption of any excess of H2O2 by 100 IU catalase. Because nonvolatile buffers cause mass spectrometer source contamination and the formation of salt adducts, the oxyHb samples for the MS analyses were prepared in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8) instead of the sodium phosphate buffer, and the reactions were stopped by freezing. SDS-PAGE and Silver Staining—Reaction mixtures were mixed with 4× loading buffer with the addition of dithiothreitol and heated at 80 °C for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, 75 pmol of heme (1.2 μg Hb) was loaded in each lane in precast 10 well 4–12% BisTris gels and separated by SDS-PAGE. 5 μl SeeBlue® Plus (Invitrogen) molecular weight markers were included on each gel. The gels were stained using Silver Stain Plus (BioRad) as described by the manufacturer. Western Blotting—After SDS-PAGE, the separated proteins were blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with a 4% cold water fish gelatin solution in 100 mm carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) for 90 min at room temperature, and then washed with a Tris buffer saline solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% cold water fish skin gelatin. Exposure of the membrane to anti-DMPO serum at a dilution of 1:5000 was performed for 1 h. Positive immuno-complexes were detected by exposure of the membrane to 1-Step NBT/BCIP reagent (Pierce) for 15 min. Tryptic Digestion Conditions—The hemoglobin control sample and the hemoglobin + DMPO + H2O2 reaction sample in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8) were subjected to tryptic digestion. Porcine trypsin (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was added to a 175-μl aliquot of the samples at a protein:enzyme ratio of 20:1. The reactions were allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—A Micromass Q-Tof Ultima Global (Waters/Micromass, Milford, MA) hybrid tandem mass spectrometer (26Borchers C. Parker C.E. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. J. Chromatogr. Sect. A. 1999; 854: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was used for the acquisition of the electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra and tandem mass spectra. This instrument is equipped with a nanoflow electrospray source and consists of a quadrupole mass filter and an orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The needle voltage was ∼3000 V, and the collision energy was 10 eV for the MS analyses. Samples for flow injection analyses were diluted 1:1 with a solution of 50:50 acetonitrile:0.1% formic acid and infused into the mass spectrometer at ∼300 nl/min using a pressure injection vessel. For the LC/MS/MS analyses, a Waters CapLC HPLC system (Waters/Micromass, Milford, MA) consisting of binary pumps and a micro autosampler was used to deliver the gradients. Injections of 8 μl were made and a linear gradient of 5–75% acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) over 35 min was used for the chromatographic separations. The column used was a 15 cm × 75 μm id Hypersil C18 (“pepmap”) column (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) at a flow rate of ∼300 nl/min. During the LC/MS/MS experiments, automated data dependent acquisition software was employed. For these acquisitions, the instrument can switch from the MS mode to the MS/MS mode and then returns back to the MS mode based on predetermined or operatorentered parameters, such as abundance and time. The advantage of this software is that both MS and MS/MS data can be acquired from a single chromatographic separation of the mixture. The collision energy used for these experiments was set according to the charge state and the m/z of the precursor as determined from a charge state recognition algorithm. Data analysis was accomplished with a MassLynx data system, MaxEnt deconvolution software, and ProteinLynx software supplied by the manufacturer. Formation of Protein-centered Radicals on Hemoglobin—In the present study, the formation of protein-centered radicals on hemoglobin has been investigated. As demonstrated previously (16Ramirez D.C. Chen Y.-R. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), when hemoglobin is reacted with hydrogen peroxide, radicals are formed which can be detected using immuno-spin trapping with an anti-DMPO antibody. Based upon these studies (16Ramirez D.C. Chen Y.-R. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), tyrosine and possibly cysteine residues were thought to be involved in the formation of radicals in hemoglobin. In the ESR spin trapping investigation, the formation of DMPO radical adducts on both tyrosyl and cysteinyl amino acids on hemoglobin in the presence of peroxides have been proposed (16Ramirez D.C. Chen Y.-R. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Maples K.R. Kennedy C.H. Johnson S.J. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To characterize the hemoglobin radicals, hemoglobin was reacted with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of DMPO spin trap. The SDS-PAGE separation and silver staining of the reaction mixtures is shown in Fig. 1, upper panel. The exposure of human oxyHb to hydrogen peroxide produces hemoglobin subunit dimers (∼30 kDa) and higher order aggregation (e.g. trimer (∼48 kDa), tetramer (∼62 kDa), etc....) (Fig. 1). DMPO protects the Hb monomers from hydrogen peroxide-mediated destruction, presumably by trapping the protein-derived radicals thus preventing subsequent protein damage (Fig. 1, upper panel, lanes C and D). Previously, antiserum that recognizes protein radical-derived nitrone adducts was developed and used to characterize myoglobin radical-derived nitrone adducts in the myoglobin/H2O2 system and in the supernatant of rat heart (10Detweiler C.D. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Chignell C.F. Germolec D. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recently, this antiserum was shown to be useful in detecting hemoglobin radical-derived nitrone adducts by exposure of red blood cells to a bolus of H2O2 (16Ramirez D.C. Chen Y.-R. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and on Hb where H2O2 was generated by UVA irradiation of ketoprophen (27He Y.-Y. Ramirez D.C. Detweiler C.D. Mason R.P. Chignell C.F. Photochem. Photobiol. 2003; 77: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The covalent binding of DMPO to the hemoglobin requires the presence of H2O2 showing that this process operates by a peroxidase-type mechanism (Scheme 1; Refs. 16Ramirez D.C. Chen Y.-R. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Nagababu E. Ramasamy S. Rifkind J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, and 29Romero N. Radi R. Linares E. Augusto O. Detweiler C.D. Mason R.P. Denicola A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44049-44057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin, hydrogen peroxide, and DMPO were all necessary to obtain hemoglobin-derived nitrone adducts (Fig. 1, lower panel, lane D). ESI/MS of DMPO Adducts on Hemoglobin—To verify that DMPO had been trapped on the hemoglobin protein, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by flow injection ESI/MS. The resulting deconvoluted ESI mass spectra for the hemoglobin samples are shown in Fig. 2. In the deconvoluted ESI mass spectrum of native hemoglobin (Fig. 2A), molecular ions of the α chain and the β-chain of average molecular weight (Mr) of 15128.5 (Mr calculated = 15126.4) and of 15869.0 (Mr calculated = 15867.2), respectively, are observed as well as oxidized forms of these ions. In the absence of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2B), the deconvoluted mass spectrum is identical to that of hemoglobin alone (Fig. 2A). In the absence of DMPO spin trap in the reaction (Fig. 2C), oxidized forms of the protein are observed (e.g. ions labeled with + O and + 2O), which represents incorporation of oxygen into the protein presumably by the reaction of protein-derived free radicals with molecular oxygen. The deconvoluted electrospray mass spectrum of the reaction mixture containing hemoglobin, H2O2, and DMPO (Fig. 2D) shows four major protonated molecules of Mr = 15128.8 Da, native α chain of hemoglobin, Mr = 15239.8 Da, α chain plus one DMPO molecule, Mr = 15869.1 Da, native β chain of hemoglobin, and Mr = 15980.6 Da, native β chain plus one DMPO molecule. In addition, minor amounts of oxidized forms of these ions are observed. These data suggest that a single DMPO molecule is trapped on each of the hemoglobin chains. None of these ions were observed in any of the control experiments (Fig. 2, A–C). These data indicate that the formation of the DMPO adduct on hemoglobin is dependent on the presence of both the hydrogen peroxide and the DMPO spin trap in the reaction mixture. In the control experiment where hemoglobin is reacted with hydrogen peroxide in the absence of DMPO as the spin trap (Fig. 2C), oxidized forms of the protein are observed. Presumably these species form from the reaction of protein-centered radicals with molecular oxygen. The hydrogen peroxide-initiated oxygen incorporation observed in Fig. 2C is protein free radical-dependent as demonstrated by its inhibition with DMPO (Fig. 2D). DMPO is known to be an anti-oxidant that blocks subsequent reactions of radicals with oxygen by trapping them. The partial protection by DMPO of Hb against H2O2-induced destruction is also apparent in the immuno-spin trapping experiments (Fig. 1, upper panel, lanes C and D). These data implicate competition between molecular oxygen and DMPO for the radical sites. LC/ESI/MS and MS/MS of Tryptic Digest of DMPO Adducts on Hemoglobin—Identification of the specific location of the DMPO adducts on hemoglobin was determined by peptide mapping and MS sequencing analyses. To determine which amino acids in hemoglobin contained a trapped DMPO molecule, hemoglobin alone and the Hb/H2O2/DMPO reaction mixture were subjected to tryptic digestion and analysis by LC/ESI/MS/MS. Because of the complexity of the digestion mixture, on-line LC was used in conjunction with the MS analyses. The data were acquired using the automated data dependent acquisition software, which enables the instrument to switch from the MS to the MS/MS mode and then return to the MS mode based on criteria set by the user. The resulting MS/MS data were then searched using ProteinLynx software. In the ProteinLynx system, DMPO was entered as a user-defined modifier agent on all the amino acids. The software will then automatically search for tryptic peptides modified by the addition of adducts of 111 Da. The corresponding MS/MS spectra will be interpreted on the basis of the presence of a DMPO adduct and indicate which amino acid modified by DMPO best fits the MS/MS data. With the ProteinLynx software, three amino acid residues were identified as containing a DMPO molecule in the Hb/H2O2/DMPO reaction mixture. None of these ions were observed in the LC/MS/MS of the hemoglobin alone control tryptic digest. These peptides correspond to tryptic peptide T10–11 (amino acids 83–104) and tryptic peptide T10 (amino acid residues 83–95) of β chain plus DMPO as well as tryptic peptide T6 (amino acids 41–56) and tryptic peptide T4 (amino acids 17–31) of α chain plus DMPO. The automatic MS/MS data interpretation assigned the DMPO to the Cys-93 of the β chain, Tyr-42 of the α chain, and Tyr-24 of the α chain. These data were confirmed manually by first transforming all ions in the MS/MS spectra to the single charge state using the MaxEnt software (Figs. 3, 4, 5). Fig. 3 shows the deconvoluted MS/MS spectrum of the tyrosine-containing tryptic peptide T6 of hemoglobin, α chain. A nearly complete series of both y and b ions (30Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2388) Google Scholar, 31Biemann K. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 16: 99-111Crossref Scopus (925) Google Scholar) are observed which correspond to cleavages along the peptide backbone. In addition, the loss of H2O from several b ions is observed (ions not labeled). The y series ions result from C-terminal peptide backbone cleavages and the b series ions result from N-terminal backbone cleavages. The mass of the b2 ion corresponds to amino acids threonine plus a DMPO-modified tyrosine. In addition, the observation of the y14 and y15 ions provides the necessary data to definitively assign the location of the DMPO adduct. The observed mass difference between the y14 and y15 ions corresponds to the mass of a tyrosine residue plus the mass of one DMPO molecule. These structurally informative fragment ions allow the assignment of the DMPO molecule to the Tyr-42 residue of tryptic peptide T6 of hemoglobin, α chain.Fig. 4Deconvoluted ESI/MS/MS spectrum of tryptic peptide T10–11 of the β chain of hemoglobin.

Ions labeled with an asterisk cannot be accounted for by a tyrosine-DMPO adduct. B, fragment ions are labeled with the DMPO located on His-20.

For clarity reasons, not all identified fragment ions are labeled on the spectrum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The deconvoluted MS/MS spectrum of tryptic peptide T10–11 (amino acids residues 83–104) of hemoglobin, β chain is shown in Fig. 4. An abundant ion of m/z 2495.3 is observed, which corresponds in mass to the loss of a DMPO molecule and the loss of H2S from the molecular ion. A series of y ions (y1 through y20) and b ions (b2 through b5) are observed as well as the loss of DMPO and H2S from the y12 through y19 ions (ions labeled with an asterisk). The mass difference between y11 and y12 corresponds to the mass of a DMPO-modified cysteine residue. These data allow the unequivocal assignment of a DMPO molecule to Cys-93 of tryptic peptide T10–11 of hemoglobin, β chain. The MS/MS spectrum of the (M+2H)2+ ion at m/z 821.4 which corresponds in mass to tryptic peptide T4 of α chain plus a DMPO molecule was deconvoluted, and the resulting MS/MS spectrum in which all ions are transformed to the single charge-state is shown in Fig. 5. Based on the ProteinLynx software interpretation of these data, the tyrosine residue in this peptide was identified as the site of the DMPO adduct. The corresponding MS/MS spectrum and fragment ions are shown in Fig. 5A. A complete series of y ions are observed as well as the b2,b4, and b5 fragment ion. The mass difference between the y7 ion of m/z 745.4 and the y8 ion of m/z 1019.5 corresponds to the mass of a tyrosine residue plus a DMPO. After interpretation of the T4 MS/MS spectrum, however, many fragment ions are observed in the higher m/z range of the spectrum that cannot be accounted for by a tyrosine-DMPO adduct, e.g. ions at m/z 908.5, 1094.5, 1165.6 (labeled with an asterisk). In addition, some ions in the lower m/z range are observed which correspond to a fragment ion plus a DMPO molecule. For example, the ion of m/z 476.3 corresponds in mass to a b4 ion (m/z 365.2) plus DMPO and the ion of m/z 547.3 corresponds in mass to a b5 ion (m/z 436.2) plus DMPO. These data indicate the presence of a DMPO adduct on a second amino acid in the T4 tryptic peptide. Further interrogation of these data indicates that there is a DMPO adduct on the histidine residue (Fig. 5B). The mass difference between the ion of m/z 1165.6 (labeled as y11 in Fig. 5B) and the ion of m/z 1413.7 (labeled as y12) corresponds to the mass of a histidine residue plus a DMPO. These data indicate the presence of a DMPO molecule on His-20 of T4 from hemoglobin, α chain. Other fragment ions observed which support the presence of DMPO on the histidine residue are labeled as y8 through y14,b4 through b8, a4, and His-DMPO (immonium ion for a histidine residue plus DMPO) in Fig. 5B. The parent ion of m/z 1640.8, therefore, is actually a mixture of two T4 tryptic peptides, one with a DMPO located at His-20 and one with a DMPO located at Tyr-24. The relative abundance of the corresponding fragment ions would lead one to speculate the His-20 DMPO adduct is present in a higher relative abundance than the Tyr-24 DMPO adduct. There is no evidence for the presence of a doubly adducted T4 peptide. Although three sites of radical formation were identified on the α chain of hemoglobin (His-20, Tyr-24, and Tyr-42), there is currently no evidence observed that multiple sites are trapped by DMPO at the same time. In the deconvoluted electrospray mass spectrum of the hemoglobin, H2O2, and DMPO reaction mixture (Fig. 2D) only ions that correspond in mass to the native α and β chains as well as ions that correspond to the addition of a single DMPO molecule to each of these chains is observed. For example, no ions are observed which would correspond to the α chain plus two DMPO molecules. The amino acid residues that have been identified by mass spectrometry as a site for DMPO spin trapping in hemoglobin are shown in Fig. 6. The figure was derived from the x-ray crystal structure of the hemoglobin tetramer (32Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Shaanan B. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The backbone of the α and β chains of hemoglobin are illustrated as ribbons, whereas the trapped amino acids and hemes are shown as spacefilled models. Hemes are shown in red, His-20, Tyr-24, and Tyr-42 on the α chain are shown in yellow, violet, and green, respectively, whereas Cys-93 on the β chain is shown in orange. Based on previous studies, it has been determined that the initial product between the reaction of heme proteins and hydrogen peroxide is an oxidized heme consisting of a ferryl iron and a porphyrin cation radical usually referred to as compound I (33Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY1999Google Scholar). An electron is then transferred from an amino acid residue to the oxidized heme. These electron transfers can occur either intermolecularly or intramolecularly (12Deterding L.J. Barr D.P. Mason R.P. Tomer K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 1273: 12863-12869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the absence of DMPO, the hydrogen peroxide-dependent oxidation of hemoglobin leads to the incorporation of oxygen into hemoglobin. In Fig. 6 it is observed that Tyr-24 and His-20 of the α chain of hemoglobin are nearly coplanar to one another. Because of the pi-pi interaction of Tyr-24 and His-20, the unpaired electron is apparently delocalized on both the tyrosine and histidine residue (pi-pi stacked radical pair) as in the chlorophyll dimer radical (34Fajer J. Brune D.C. Davis M.S. Forman A. Spaulding L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4956-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 35Webber A.N. Lubitz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta-Bioenergetics. 2001; 1507: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, only one radical is trapped at a time. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a histidinyl radical in a hemeprotein, although histidine is a common ligand of the redox active iron in such proteins and has been reported in the SOD/H2O2 system (36Gunther M.R. Peters J.A. Sivaneri M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9160-9166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The pi-pi stacking of histidine with tyrosine must lower the oxidation of histidine significantly because the oxidation potential of histidine (1.170 V) is normally well above that of tyrosine, cysteine, or even tyroptophan (1.015 V) (37Navaratnam S. Parsons B.J. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1998; 94: 2577-2581Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In summary, using peptide mapping and MS sequencing methodologies, the DMPO radical adducts on hemoglobin were identified. Tandem mass spectrometry provided structural information as to the location of the DMPO molecules in the hemoglobin. It was determined that Cys-93 on hemoglobin, β chain, Tyr-42, His-20, and Tyr-24 on the α chain of hemoglobin all form a DMPO adduct. Thus, peptide mapping in combination with mass spectrometry is an extremely powerful technique for determining the location of radical adducts in proteins. We thank Drs. C. Hager-Braun and O. Lardinois for critical review of the manuscript."

In this study we demonstrated that CS/DS hybrid chains purified from embryonic pig brain displayed marked neuritogenic activity and growth factor binding activities toward fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), FGF10, FGF18, pleiotrophin, and midkine, all of which exhibit neuroregulatory activities in the brain. In contrast, the CS/DS preparation from adult pig brain showed considerably less activity to bind these growth factors and no neuritogenic activity. Structural analysis indicated that the average size of the CS/DS chains was similar (40 kDa) between these two preparations, but the disaccharide compositions differed considerably, with a significant proportion of l-iduronic acid (IdoUA)-containing disaccharides (8∼9%) in the CS/DS chains from embryos but not in those from adults (<1%). Interestingly, both neurite outgrowth-promoting activity and growth factor binding activities of the CS/DS chains from embryos were abolished by digestion not only with chondroitinase ABC but also with chondroitinase B, suggesting that the IdoUA-containing motifs are essential for these activities. These findings imply that the temporal expression of CS/DS hybrid structures containing both GlcUA and IdoUA and binding activities toward various growth factors play important roles in neurogenesis in the early stages of the development of the brain.

Although the CS chains attached to CS-PGs have attracted little attention until recently compared with heparan sulfate (9Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), recent advances in the structural biology of CS chains have suggested important biological functions in the development of the brain (10Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that the composition of CS chains changes with aging and normal brain maturation and that some CS epitopes are only found in specific sections of the avian and mammalian brain (7Clement M.A. Nadanaka S.

The developmentally regulated expression and tissue-specific distribution of CS variants suggest that CS chains differing in the degree and profile of sulfation exhibit distinct functions during the development of the brain.The functions of CS-PGs and CS chains in the central nervous system can be categorized as the regulation of cell adhesion and migration, neurite formation, polarization of neurons, synaptic plasticity, survival of neurons, etc. (for reviews, see Ref. 1Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar and 4Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Concerning the neurite formation, studies have shown that CS-PGs and CS chains exhibit primarily inhibitory effects on neurite outgrowth on defined growth-promoting substrata (4Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and axon guidance in vivo (12Ichijo H. Connect.

The inhibitory function of CS chains was supported by recent studies demonstrating that degradation of CS chains by in vivo injection of chondroitinase ABC permitted axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury (14Bradbury E.J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 783-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) report that DSD-1-PG, a CS-PG derived from neonatal mouse brain, displayed significant neurite outgrowth-promoting activity in vitro toward hippocampal neurons from embryonic day 18 (E18) rats, and this activity was neutralized by the monoclonal antibody 473 HD, which recognizes a structure embedded in the CS chains (referred to as the DSD-1 epitope). Clement et al. (7Clement M.A. Nadanaka S. Masayama K. Mandl C. Sugahara K. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28444-28453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) show that the CS side chains of DSD-1-PG contain a small but significant proportion of an over-sulfated D disaccharide unit (GlcUA[2-O-sulfate]β1–3GalNAc[6-O-sulfate]). Over-sulfated CS-D from shark cartilage contains a high proportion (∼20%) of the D unit and exhibits neurite outgrowth-promoting activity, whereas CS-A and CS-C do not (17Nadanaka S. Clement A.M. Masayama K. Faissner A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Clement et al. (18Clement A.M. Sugahara K. Faissner A. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 269: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) further demonstrate that another over-sulfated CS variant CS-E from squid cartilage, which contains a high proportion (more than 60%) of the E unit, GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate), promotes neurite outgrowth in a DSD-1 epitope-independent fashion, giving a long prominent neurite with an axon-like morphology.Recently, Hikino et al. (19Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43744-43754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have shown that the over-sulfated dermatan sulfate (DS) chains purified from various marine organisms also exhibit such activities in a sulfation pattern-dependent manner and that the alleged CS side chains of DSD-1-PG are actually of the DS-type, which implies the possible involvement of DS chains in the neuritogenesis during brain development. Lafont et al. (20Lafont F. Rouget M. Triller A. Prochiantz A. Rousselet A.D. Development. 1992; 114: 17-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously reported that soluble DS chains prepared from bovine mucosa increased dendrite growth in mesencephalic neurons. These findings suggest that not only over-sulfated CS but also over-sulfated DS chains are neuritogenic. Thus, CS/DS chains cannot simply be classified as either supportive or inhibitory of neurite outgrowth; the sulfation pattern and specific sugar sequence may define these properties (3Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Neurol. 2003; 182: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Compared with CS-PGs, DS-PGs are minor components of the adult mammalian brain, and so far only a few DS-PG species, such as decorin and biglycan, have been partially characterized (22Kappler J. Stichel C.C. Gleichmann M. Gillen C. Junghans U. Kress H. Müller H.W. Brain Res. 1998; 18: 328-332Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, DS-type GAG chains appear to exist in the brain, but their distribution, developmental changes, and functions remain unclear.The CS/DS variants, from marine organisms used in our previous studies, include CS-D, CS-E, and hagfish notochord-derived CS-H (the major H disaccharide unit is IdoUAα1–3GalNAc[4,6-O-disulfate]), all of which contain unusually high proportions of over-sulfated disaccharide units. However, they are only minor components in the brain (7Clement M.A. Nadanaka S. Masayama K. Mandl C. Sugahara K. Faissner A. J. Biol.

To evaluate the contribution of the CS/DS chains to the neurite extension, it is essential to characterize CS/DS chains purified from mammalian brains. The developmentally regulated disaccharide composition of brain CS/DS chains suggests that at different developmental stages the chains may have distinct biological functions in neurite formation and growth factor signaling (8Maeda N.

(Tokyo, Japan): chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4), chondro-4-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.9) and chondro-6-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.10) from Proteus vulgaris; chondroitinase AC-I (EC 4.2.2.5), chondroitinase B (EC 4.2.2), heparitinase (EC 4.2.2.8), and heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7) from Flavobacterium heparinum; hyaluronidase (EC 4.2.2.1) from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus. Recombinant human (rh)-midkine (MK) expressed in Escherichia coli and rh-fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) (acidic FGF) expressed in E. coli were purchased from PeproTech EC LTD (London, UK). rh-pleiotrophin (PTN) expressed in E. coli was from RELIA Tech GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany), and rh-heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) expressed in Sf 21 insect cells was from R&D systems (Minneapolis). rh-FGF2 (basic FGF) expressed in E. coli was from Genzyme Techne (Minneapolis, MN), and rh-FGF10 expressed in E. coli was provided by Takashi Katsumata (Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Research Center, Osaka, Japan). Recombinant mouse FGF18 was prepared as reported (27Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang Y.P. Hill D. Ring B.D. Scully S. Bolon B. DeRose M. Luethy R. Simonet W.S. Arakawa T. Danilenko D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6063-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Actinase E was obtained from Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Sep-Pak Plus Accell™ anion-exchange cartridges were obtained from Waters Corp. (Milford, MA), and a Superdex 75 HR column (10 × 300 mm), a Superdex Peptide HR column (10 × 300 mm), a Superdex 200 HR column (10 × 300 mm), and prepacked disposable PD-10 columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Size-defined dextrans (average Mr 65,500, 37,500, and 18,000), bovine intestinal mucosa HS (average Mr 7,500), and low molecular weight heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa (average Mr 6,000) were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest quality available.Preparation and Purification of CS/DS Chain Fractions—Embryonic (9.7 g) and adult (108.0 g) pig brains were homogenized with 2.5 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 20 mm EDTA (11Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Tone Y. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31377-31381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C, and to the resultant supernatant 4 volumes of ethanol was added, which precipitated PBS-soluble CS/DS-PGs. The PBS-insoluble fraction was further homogenized with 1.5 volumes of acetone, and the acetone-insoluble materials were collected by centrifugation. After drying, both PBS-soluble and -insoluble CS/DS-PG-containing fractions from embryo and adult pig brains were extensively digested with actinase E at 60 °Cin0.1 m borate-sodium buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm CaCl2. After incubation and subsequent treatment with 5% trichloroacetic acid, the GAG-containing fractions were recovered by ethanol precipitation. Each GAG fraction was desalted by gel filtration on a PD-10 column and then fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography on an Accell QMA Plus cartridge using stepwise elution with 0.3 m phosphate buffers, pH 6.0, containing 0.15, 1.0, and 1.5 m NaCl. All subfractions were desalted by gel filtration on a PD-10 column. The total amount of GAGs in each subfraction was evaluated by the carbazole reaction (28Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5141) Google Scholar), and the CS/DS disaccharide composition was analyzed by chondroitinase ABC digestion followed by HPLC (29Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The 1.0 m NaCl-eluted fractions from both PBS-soluble and -insoluble fractions, which contained more than 90% of the recovered CS/DS chains of the embryo or adult pig brain-derived sample, was used for further purification.To remove hyaluronic acid (HA) PBS-soluble and -insoluble fractions obtained from both embryonic and adult pig brains were subjected to digestion with Streptomyces hyaluronidase at 60 °C in 20 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0 (30Ohya T. Kaneko Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). After 4 h of incubation, the digests were subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a column of Superdex 75 (10 × 300 mm) that was eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Absorption at 210 nm was used to monitor GAG chains. The flow-through fractions, which contained GAG chains, were collected, pooled, and evaporated to dryness. The hyaluronidase-resistant GAGs were subsequently digested with a mixture of heparitinase and heparinase in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm calcium acetate for 4 h (31Sugahara K. Yamada S. Yoshida K. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1528-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polysaccharides resistant to heparinase and heparitinase were recovered by gel filtration as described above. After the removal of HA and heparan sulfate, the CS/DS-containing materials were passed through a C-18 cartridge to remove trace amounts of free peptides. The CS/DS fractions thus prepared from PBS-soluble and -insoluble fractions of embryonic pig brains were designated Es-CS/DS and Ei-CS/DS, whereas those of adult pig brains were As-CS/DS and Ai-CS/DS, respectively. The purity of all these preparations was checked by gel filtration after chondroitinase ABC digestion and by amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis with 3 m HCl in the gas phase at 100 °C for 16 h.Determination of Molecular Size—An aliquot (10.0 μg) of Es-, Ei-, As-, or Ai-CS/DS was chromatographed on a gel filtration column of Superdex 200 (10 × 300 mm) that had been calibrated using a series of size-defined commercial polysaccharides (32Yamada S. Okada Y. Ueno M. Iwata S. Deepa S.S. Nishimura S. Fujita M. van Die I. Hirabayashi Y. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31877-31886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The column was eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 3-min intervals, lyophilized, and digested with 10 mIU of chondroitinase ABC as described below. The resultant digests were analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC as described previously.Analysis of Disaccharide Composition—An aliquot (4.0 μg) of Es-, Ei-, As-, or Ai-CS/DS was incubated with 40 mIU of chondroitinase ABC in a 50mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 60 mm sodium acetate in a total volume of 40 μlat37 °C for 4 h (33Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One-fourth of the digest was subsequently incubated with 40 mIU of chondro-4-sulfatase or chondro-6-sulfatase in a total volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for 1 h (34Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Each digest corresponding to one-fourth of the starting materials was analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC on an amino-bound silica PA-03 column (4.6 × 250 mm, YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan) as reported (29Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Identification and quantification of the resulting disaccharides were achieved by comparison with CS-derived authentic unsaturated disaccharides: ΔHexUAα1–3GalNAc, ΔHexUAα1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), ΔHexUAα1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate) (ΔDi-4S), ΔHexUA(2-O-sulfate)α1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), ΔHexUAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate), and ΔHexUA(2-O-sulfate)α1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate).Analysis of the Glucuronate: Iduronate Ratio—An aliquot (2 μg) of Es-, Ei-, As-, or Ai-CS/DS was exhaustively digested with chondroitinases ABC (20 mIU), AC-I (20 mIU), or B (10 mIU) in the appropriate buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3 (for AC-I) (19Hikino M. Mikami T. Faissner A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Pavão M.S. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43744-43754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 (for B) (35Sugahara K. Ohkita Y. Shibata Y. Yoshida K. Ikegami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7204-7721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (for ABC, see above). Each digestion was initiated with half the amount of the enzyme described above and run at 37 °C for 12 h, after which the rest of the enzyme was added, and incubation was continued for another 2 h. Half of each digest was analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC for identification and quantification of the resultant unsaturated disaccharides as described above.Analysis of the Iduronate Distribution—An aliquot (0.4 μg) of Es- or Ei-CS/DS was digested with chondroitinase AC-I (6 mIU) and another with chondroitinase B (6 mIU) as described above. The reaction mixtures were lyophilized and derivatized with a fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide (2AB), then the excess 2AB reagent was removed by paper chromatography (36Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The 2AB derivatives were subjected to gel filtration on a column (10 × 300 mm) of Superdex Peptide using 0.025 m NH4HCO3 containing 7% 1-propanol as an effluent at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Eluates were monitored by fluorescence with excitation and emission wavelengths of 330 and 420 nm, respectively. Identification and quantification of 2AB-labeled oligosaccharides were achieved by comparison with size-defined 2AB-labeled standard unsaturated CS disaccharides and sulfated oligosaccharides 2S. S. Deepa and K. Sugahara, unpublished results. prepared by 2AB derivatization of CS-E oligosaccharides generated by testicular hyaluronidase digestion (37Kinoshita A. Yamada S. Haslam S.M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19656-19665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The percentage of galactosaminidic bonds cleaved by each specific enzyme was calculated from the distribution of fluorescence intensity across peaks relative to the total amount of the starting material.Delayed Extraction Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)—The chondroitinase AC-I-resistant 2AB-labeled oligosaccharides, which were obtained as described above, were mixed with a matrix of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and used for MALDI-TOF MS analyses in a positive ion mode as described previously (38Sugiyama E. Mizuno N. Uemura K. Taketomi T. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The MS spectra were recorded on a Voyager DE-RP/Pro (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in the linear mode.Preparation of Substrates for Cell Culture—An aliquot (2 μg) of Es-CS/DS or As-CS/DS was digested with 5 mIU of chondroitinases ABC, AC-I, or B in a total volume of 20 μl of the appropriate buffer at 37 °C (or 30 °C for chondroitinase B) for 120 min, and the digests were used to prepare substrates for cell cultures. Aliquots (2 μg) of the parent CS/DS fractions or their chondroitin lyase-treated preparations were individually coated onto plastic coverslips (10 × 10 mm) that had been precoated with poly-dl-ornithine (P-ORN) (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan) dissolved in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.2, at a concentration of 1.5 μg/ml. Heat-inactivated chondroitin lyases with their buffers were used as controls.Cell Culture and Neurite Outgrowth Promotion Assays—Cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons were established from E16 animals as described (7Clement M.A. Nadanaka S.

Briefly, hippocampi were dissected from mouse E16 embryonic brains and dissociated into a single cell suspension. The cells were seeded on coverslips coated with defined GAG substrates at a density of 10,000 cell/cm2 and cultivated in Eagle’s modified essential medium containing N2 supplements (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm pyruvate, 0.1% (w/v) ovalbumin, 0.029% (w/v) l-glutamine, 0.2% (w/v) sodium hydrogen carbonate, and 5 mm HEPES. The cultures were incubated in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After 24 h of incubation the cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and then immunostained with anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (Leico Technologies Inc., St. Louis, MO) and anti-neurofilament (Sigma) at 1:100 and 1:250 dilutions, respectively, in PBS containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The antibodies were then detected using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. At least three independent experiments in duplicate were carried out for each culture condition.The stained hippocampal neurons were analyzed with a morphometric station equipped with an optical microscope (BH-2, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), a digital camera (HC-300Z/OL, Olympus), and software (Mac Scope Mitani Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Clearly isolated cells with at least one neurite longer than the diameter of the cell body were chosen at random. The length of the neurites and the number of primary neurites (longer than the cell body diameter) were determined by drawing and counting, respectively. The data are expressed as the mean ± S.E., and the significance of difference between the means was evaluated using Mann-Whitney’s U test.Growth Factor Binding Assays Using a BIAcore System—Binding reactions were carried out at 25 °C on a BIAcore™ J Biosensor (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using streptavidin-derivatized sensor chips. Es-CS/DS and As-CS/DS were biotinylated as described (39D"
https://openalex.org/W2012168396,"Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 potassium channels are plasma membrane glycoproteins involved in action potential repolarization. We have shown previously that glycosylation affects the gating function of Kv1.1 (Watanabe, I., Wang, H. G., Sutachan, J. J., Zhu, J., Recio-Pinto, E. & Thornhill, W. B. (2003) J. Physiol. (Lond.) 550, 51–66) and that a pore region determinant of Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 affects their cell surface trafficking negatively or positively, respectively (Zhu, J., Watanabe, I., Gomez, B. & Thornhill, W. B. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 39419–39427). Here we investigated the role of N-glycosylation of Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 on their protein stability, cellular localization pattern, and trafficking to the cell surface. We found that preventing N-glycosylation of Kv1.4 decreased its protein stability, induced its high partial intracellular retention, and decreased its cell surface protein levels, whereas it had little or no effect on these parameters for Kv1.1. Exchanging a trafficking pore region determinant between Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 reversed these effects of glycosylation on these chimeric channels. Thus it appeared that the Kv1.4 pore region determinant and the sugar tree attached to the S1–S2 linker showed some type of dependence in promoting proper trafficking of the protein to the cell surface, and this dependence can be transferred to chimeric Kv1.1 proteins that contain the Kv1.4 pore. Understanding the different trafficking programs of Kv1 channels, and whether they are altered by glycosylation, will highlight the different posttranslational mechanisms available to cells to modify their cell surface ion channel levels and possibly their signaling characteristics. Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 potassium channels are plasma membrane glycoproteins involved in action potential repolarization. We have shown previously that glycosylation affects the gating function of Kv1.1 (Watanabe, I., Wang, H. G., Sutachan, J. J., Zhu, J., Recio-Pinto, E. & Thornhill, W. B. (2003) J. Physiol.

Many plasma membrane proteins are N-glycosylated on their extracellular domain in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and further glycosylated in the Golgi before transport to the cell surface. A carbohydrate tree on a membrane protein could affect its folding, stability, trafficking to the cell surface, and/or function. The occurrence of carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome I–IV disorder in humans, which can be life-threatening, highlights the fact that proper glycosylation of both membrane and secretory glycoproteins are essential for normal development and health (1Carchon H. Van Schaftingen E. Matthijs G. Jaeken J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Jaeken J. Stibler H. Hagberg B. Acta Paediatr Scand. 1991; 375: 1-71Google Scholar). Potassium (K+) channels make up a large family of membrane proteins (3Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev.

Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes.3rd Ed. Sinauer, Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). In the Kv1 voltage-gated K+ channel subfamily, Kv1.1-Kv1.5 members, which express functionally as homotetramers or heterotetramers, have one N-glycosylation consensus site on the extracellular S1-S2 linker (6Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schruer K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). We have presented evidence that N-glycosylation of Kv1.1 K+ channels affects the gating function by a combined surface potential and a cooperative subunit interaction mechanism but is not required for cell surface expression (7Thornhill W.B.

Recio-Pinto E. Thornhill W.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 550: 51-66Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have also used mammalian voltage-gated Kv1 subfamily members expressed in cell lines as a model system to investigate their intracellular trafficking and cell surface expression. In transiently transfected cell lines, homomeric Kv1.1 or Kv1.4 proteins were efficiently N-glycosylated in the ER, but Kv1.1 exhibited inefficient trans-Golgi glycosylation and low cell surface expression levels, whereas Kv1.4 showed efficient trans-Golgi glycosylation and high surface expression (9Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We took advantage of these differences to map the determinants on Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 to pore regions that were responsible for these effects because exchanging these regions conferred upon the recipient protein the characteristics of the donor protein (9Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We also showed that in a Kv1.1/Kv1.4 heteromer Kv1.1 was dominant negative for surface expression levels (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Given the above results, the aims of this report were to determine whether there were any differential effects of N-glycosylation on the intracellular trafficking and cell surface expression levels of Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 channels and to examine whether a trafficking pore region determinant modifies these possible differential effects. Cell Lines and Molecular Biology—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) pro5 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATTC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, or α-MEM, supplemented with 0.35 mm proline, 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. COS7 cells were from ATCC. Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 have one extracellular N-glycosylation consensus site at NTT or NDT, which are between S1 and S2 (6Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schruer K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). These Asn to Gln mutants were constructed by standard PCR methods as we have described for the construction of other mutants (9Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol.

Appropriate fragments from the first PCR reactions were gel-purified and used in a second PCR reaction to construct Kv1.1N207Q and Kv1.4N354Q. Restriction enzyme-treated cDNAs were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3, and integrity of constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient transfections were used because we wanted to estimate channel total protein and cell surface protein levels for comparison, as described below, between a wild type and an N-linked mutant construct. Stably transfected cell clones were not used here because each clone can produce significantly different channel mRNA levels and thus different protein expression levels due to the construct integrating at different genomic positions, which can affect transcription of the gene. LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) was used with 0.5 μg of plasmid for transfection per 35-mm dish unless noted otherwise. Transfected cells were processed for ∼20 h posttransfection because by this time Kv1 surface levels are maximal (data not shown). Total and Cell Surface Protein Characterization—Total cell protein from a 35-mm dish was used for immunoblots as described previously (9Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol.

Cell surface biotinylation with Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) of intact cells followed the manufacturer’s protocol. Intact cells were washed and then incubated in Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml) in PBS with low calcium and magnesium on ice for 20 min. Cells were then washed four times with PBS with 10 mm Tris-Cl and solubilized with radioimmune precipitation buffer with protease inhibitors (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.4% deoxycholate, 1.2% Triton X-100, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mm leupeptin/pepstatin). Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min, and supernatants used to precipitate biotinylated surface proteins with 50 μl of a 1:1 slurry of streptavidin beads (Pierce) by rocking overnight at 5 °C. Beads were then washed four times in PBS and bound proteins eluted in SDS sample buffer and run on 9% SDS gels. For total protein or cell surface protein immunoblots, following SDS-PAGE proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Bio-Rad); the filter was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS and then incubated in primary antibody overnight (for Kv1.1, Kv1.1 rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to the N terminus (amino acids 4–27) 1:1000 (7Thornhill W.B.

After washing, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary or anti-mouse secondary antibodies were added and the bound antibodies detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, ECL detection kit) and preflashed x-ray film (Kodak XAR5). Aliquots of the original lysate were immunoblotted with actin antibodies (Sigma) to control for possible cell density differences, and Kv1 signals were normalized to any differences in actin levels. A MicroTex 8700 scanner was used to capture a film image, and NIH Image software (1.6) that had its own internal calibration was used to perform relative densitometry analysis (9Zhu J. Watanabe I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Axopatch 200B patch clamp and Pclamp8 software/Digidata 1200 system were used. Transiently transfected mammalian cells (with green fluorescent protein plasmid) were viewed using Hoffman optics (400× magnification) and a fluorescence microscope to identify transfected cells by their green fluorescence. Our standard recording solution contained (in mm) NaCl 150.0, KCl 5, MgCl2 1.0, CaCl2 2.0, glucose 5.0, and HEPES 10.0 (pH 7.3) at room temperature (23–25 °C). Patch pipettes were pulled from glass hematocrit capillary tubing or 8161 corning glass (Warner Inst.) and had tip resistances of 1.0–2.0 megohms when filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mm) KCl 145, NaCl 5.0, MgCl2 1.0, EGTA 10.0, glucose 5.0, and NaHEPES 10.0 (pH 7.3). After establishing the whole cell configuration, cells were held at –80 mV, and membrane capacitance and series resistance (Rs) were estimated using pClampex software from a transient capacitance current elicited by a 10-mV hyperpolarizing voltage step from –80 mV. Mean linear membrane leak current, assessed by averaging the current response to 10-mV hyperpolarizations, was subtracted by the P/4 protocol. Membrane capacitance is compensated using the amplifier controls and Rs (usually 2.5–4 megohms uncompensated) is compensated by patch clamp circuitry by 85–95%. The general voltage-pulse protocol is to hold at –80 mV and step to 50 mV for 80 ms. The current induced by the voltage step is filtered at 5 kHz (–3 dB cutoff) and digitized at 50-ms intervals. Maximum conductance values (G) are obtained from the mean value of the leak-subtracted peak current (I) using Ohm’s law, G = I/(Vp – EK), and a predicted Nernst K equilibrium potential (EK) of –84 mV. Data are displayed as the normalized mean to the control construct as Gm/Cm (maximal conductance/capacitance) ± S.E., n = 10–12. Protein Half-life Estimations—Kv1.1, Kv1.4, and their N-linked mutant total protein half-lives were estimated by cell labeling with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (200 μCi/ml, Tran35S-label, Amersham Biosciences) in medium without methionine or cysteine for 5 h. The labeled medium was removed and cells chased in unlabeled 5 mm methionine and cysteine in complete medium for different times. Solubilized cells (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were incubated in Kv1.1 antibody (1/500) or Kv1.4 antibody (1/200) overnight. Aliquots of lysed cells were acid-precipitated (Whatman, trichloroacetic acid) to estimate total 35S incorporation into cellular protein for each 35-mm dish. Protein A/G-beads (Invitrogen) were added for 3 h with rocking, and the beads were washed to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Specifically bound Kv1 proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, and a volume added to an SDS 9% gel was adjusted using the cpm signal incorporated into total proteins. Kv1 radiolabeled bands were detected by fluorography (Amplify, Amersham Biosciences) with preflashed x-ray film (Kodak XAR-5). Densitometry analysis, as outlined above, was used to estimate signals, and values were normalized to time zero (start of chase), which was taken as 1.0 and plotted as a function of time. Protein half-life values were estimated from a curve fitted to a decaying single exponential time course, mean ± S.E. Kv1.1, Kv1.4, and their N-linked mutant cell surface protein half-lives were estimated as follows. Intact cells were biotinylated as described above and washed to remove the biotinylation reagent, and a sample for time zero was taken and processed for streptavidin precipitation and immunoblotting analysis as described above. Other biotinylated and washed cells in dishes were returned to complete medium and incubated at 37 °C for increasing “chase” times, in the absence of biotinylation reagent, before streptavidin precipitation and immunoblotting. Signals were normalized to the value at time zero (start of chase) and plotted as a function of time to obtain the cell surface protein half-lives as described above. A decrease in the cell surface Kv1 signal was indicative that biotinylated Kv1 proteins were internalized and degraded via the endosomal/lysosmal pathway. However if a fraction of the internalized biotinylated Kv1 proteins were recycled intact back to the surface, then our estimates of surface protein half-life would be overestimated. Immunofluorescence Localization Pattern—COS7 transfected with Kv1.1, Kv1.4, and their N-linked mutants were incubated on glass coverslips for 20 h posttransfection. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, blocked, and incubated in primary antibody followed by secondary antibody conjugated with a fluorophore (Alexa dyes, Molecular Probes) and mounting on glass slides (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were viewed with an Olympus BX50 microscope (with BX-FLA fluorescence attachment and the appropriate filter cube), and photographs were taken using a 100× objective with a camera set for automatic time exposure. Thus photographs should be viewed for the overall localization pattern of Kv1 protein and not for their signal intensity. Nontransfected cells showed no fluorescence signal when incubated as described above, and transfected cells showed no signal with only secondary antibody (data not shown). Antibodies to ER proteins (calnexin, Stressgen) and Golgi proteins (GM130 or p230, Transduction Laboratories) were also used to help localize these organelles (data not shown). Preventing Glycosylation of Kv1.4 Decreased Protein Stability, Induced High Partial ER Retention, and Decreased Surface Protein Levels, Whereas It Had Little or No Effect on These Parameters for Kv1.1—Kv1.4 and Kv 1.1 have ∼86% amino acid identity from their N-terminal T1 domain to the end of their S6 transmembrane domains (6Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schruer K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), and thus these are two very closely related proteins. There is only one N-glycosylation consensus site, NX(S/T), on their extracellular protein linkers (Fig. 1, A and B), and this site was N-glycosylated on both channel proteins; for Kv1.1 it is Asn207 and for Kv1.4 it is Asn354 (see below). What is the effect of N-glycosylation of Kv1.1 or Kv1.4 homomers on their protein stability and trafficking to the cell surface? To address these questions, site-directed mutagenesis was used to engineer a glutamine (Gln) at Asn207 and Asn354 on Kv1.1 and Kv1.4, respectively (Fig. 1B). Kv1.1, Kv1.4, and their N-linked mutants were expressed transiently in CHO cells, where they would be expressed as homotetramers in this cell line (9Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Kv1.1 proteins were detected on immunoblots of total protein (ER, Golgi, plasma membrane) as 2–3 bands (Fig. 2A, lane 1) and as 1 band from the cell surface population by surface biotinylation and immunoblotting (Fig. 2A, lane 3), as we have shown previously (9Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Kv1.1 bands were high mannose-type glycoproteins because they were sensitive to cleavage by Endo H glycosidase (data not shown). Kv1.1N207Q showed a couple of bands (Fig. 2A, lane 2), but they were not N-glycosylated. The lower band was a nonglycosylated core protein, and the upper band appeared to be phosphorylated (11Ivanina T. Perez T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); both bands were Endo H glycosidase-insensitive (data not shown). In contrast, Kv1.4 monomers detected from total protein (ER, Golgi, plasma membrane) were a mixture of high mannose-type and mature-type glycoproteins (trans-Golgi glycosylated proteins) (Fig. 2D, lane 1), and mature-type glycoproteins were enriched on the cell surface (Fig. 2D, lane 3). Kv1.4N354Q was detected as 1 band in total protein and surface protein (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 4, respectively), and it was insensitive to Endo H glycosidase (data not shown). Thus, in transiently transfected cell lines the majority of wild type Kv1.1 channels were high mannose-type glycoproteins, whereas the majority of wild type Kv1.4 channels were mature-type glycoproteins. Kv1.1 and Kv1.1N207Q total protein levels (ER, Golgi, plasma membrane) (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2, and B) and cell surface levels, by estimates of surface protein by biotinylation and immunoblotting and conductance density (Gm/Cm, maximal conductance/capacitance) by patch clamping (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4, and B), were somewhat similar. A similar pattern for surface levels was recorded in transfected COS7 and CAD-like neuronal cells, suggesting that this effect was not cell line-specific (Fig. 2, G and H). A similar total protein level for both Kv1.1 and Kv1.1N207Q suggested that there was no difference in their protein stability. Indeed Kv1.1 and Kv1.1N207Q showed similar total protein half-lives of 4.2 and 4.3 h, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B), and similar surface protein half-lives of 1.1 and 0.8 h, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). The surface protein level (Fig. 2B) divided by the total protein level (Fig. 2B) gave a surface protein/total protein ratio that was >1.0 for Kv1.1N207Q versus Kv1.1; this suggested that Kv1.1N207Q had a similar or somewhat less intracellular retention versus Kv1.1 (Fig. 2C). Similar surface protein/total protein ratios suggested that Kv1.1 and Kv1.1N207Q would exhibit similar whole cell immunofluorescence localization patterns in cells. We used transfected COS7 cells because they have consistent ER and Golgi morphology from cell to cell. Kv1.1 and Kv1.1N207Q localization patterns were similar in COS7 cells (Fig. 5, A and B), and signals overlapped extensively with calnexin signals (data not shown), indicating that both proteins exhibited high partial ER retention. Similar results were found in transfected CHO cells (data not shown). In a previous study (8Watanabe I. Wang H.G. Sutachan J.J. Zhu J. Recio-Pinto E. Thornhill W.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 550: 51-66Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of glycosylation, particularly sialylation, on the function of Kv1.1 channels expressed stably in CHO cells and found that this modification affected channel gating. We had to further screen numerous cell clones by immunoblotting to find a few that stably expressed Kv1.1 as mostly a mature-type glycoprotein, with sialic acids, on the cell surface. Cell surface half-life estimations were similar for wild type Kv1.1 as mostly a mature-type glycoprotein and Kv1.1N207Q without a sugar tree (data not shown). Thus, in transient transfections Kv1.1 is mostly expressed as a high mannose-type glycoprotein, whereas stable transfectants can be found that do express it mostly as a mature-type glycoprotein on the surface. In either case, cell surface half-lives were similar to Kv1.1N207Q.Fig. 4Preventing glycosylation of Kv1.4 decreased its cell surface protein half-life but had little or no effect on this parameter for Kv1.1. Cell surface protein half-lives of Kv1.1, Kv1.1N207Q, Kv1.4, and Kv1.4N354Q in transiently transfected CHO cells were estimated by surface biotinylation/immunoblotting and chasing in nonbiotinylation media as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, Kv1.1 and Kv1.1N207Q profiles of bands as a function of time of chase.

Immunofluorescence localization is shown for Kv1.1, Kv1.1N207Q, Kv1.4, and Kv1.4N354Q proteins and their chimeras Kv1.1C1, Kv1.1C1N207Q, Kv1.4C2, and Kv1.4C2N354Q (A–H, respectively), which have their pore region determinants exchanged in fixed, permeabilized, transiently transfected COS7 cells. The important parameter is the overall localization pattern of a Kv1 protein and not its signal intensity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast, Kv1.4N354Q total protein (ER, Golgi, plasma membrane) was only ∼40% the level of Kv1.4 (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2, and E), whereas for cell surface levels, by estimating surface protein by biotinylation and immunoblotting and conductance density (Gm/Cm, maximal conductance/capacitance) by patch clamping the level was only ∼15% the level of control (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 4, and E). A similar pattern for surface levels was found in transfected COS7 and CAD-like neuronal cells, which suggested this effect was not cell line-specific (Fig. 2, G and H). Kv1.4N354Q proteins that were expressed on the cell surface exhibited voltage-gated currents consistent with the notion that surface nonglycosylated channels were folded into functional tetramers. A decreased total protein level suggested that the Kv1.4N354Q protein stability was decreased, and this was a possible partial explanation for its lower surface protein level. Indeed, Kv1.4 and Kv1.4N354Q showed different total protein half-lives of 6.3 and 3.8 h, respectively (Fig. 3, C and D), and different cell surface protein half-lives of 5.3 and 1.8 h, respectively (Fig. 4, C and D). Our Kv1.4 surface protein half-life estimation in CHO cells of 5.3 h is longer than the ∼1.5 h that was estimated for Kv1.4 in transfected HEK293 (12Jugloff D.G.M. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), a difference that may be cell line-specific. Thus Kv1.4N354Q exhibited a decreased total and surface protein half-life versus Kv1.4. Furthermore, the surface protein/total protein ratio here was only ∼0.35 for Kv1.4N354Q versus Kv1.4 (Fig. 2F). This finding suggested that, in addition to a decreased protein half-life, the Kv1.4N354Q protein may also be preferentially retained intracellularly versus Kv1.4. Indeed, the immunofluorescence localization pattern in COS7 cells was very different for Kv1.4 versus Kv1.4N354Q. Kv1.4 cells exhibited a localization pattern characteristic of high cell surface expression; it showed a diffuse signal on the cell surface, and the perimeter of the cell was clearly visible (Fig. 5C); and its pattern was different from the ER protein calnexin (data not shown). In contrast, Kv1.4N354Q showed a pattern characteristic of a low cell surface expression and high partial ER retention with small intracellular structures similar to aggresomes in some cells (Fig. 5D, arrow); the signal overlapped extensively with calnexin, an ER marker (data not shown). A similar result was seen in transfected CHO cells (data not shown). Thus, it appeared that Kv1.4N354Q showed higher intracellular retention because of an increased ER retention. We used an additional approach to inhibit the addition of the carbohydrate tree at Asn354 on Kv1.4 without changing asparagine to a glutamine. Both Kv1.4 and Kv1.4N354Q were incubated in tunicamycin, which prevented N-glycosylation of Kv1.4 (Fig. 2I, lane 1), and under this condition cell surface protein levels were similar for both proteins (Fig. 2, I and J). Kv1.4N354Q was also incubated with tunicamycin to control for its possible nonspecific effects on protein translation and/or processing. Immunofluorescence of Kv1.4-transfected COS cells in the presence of tunicamycin also showed an increased intracellular localization pattern to the ER and aggresomes, as we recorded in Kv1.4N354Q cells without the inhibitor (data not shown). These findings were consistent with our mutagenesis results that the determinant on Kv1.4 that affected trafficking and protein stability was the carbohydrate tree and not the amino acid to which it was attached. These results suggested that preventing N-glycosylation of Kv1.4 decreased protein stability, induced high partial ER retention, and decreased the cell surface levels, whereas this had little or no effect on Kv1.1 (whether as a high mannose-type or a mature-type glycoprotein). It appeared that an ER subpopulation of Kv1.4N354Q proteins that trafficked to the cell surface were functional, and apparently properly folded, but exhibited a lower protein half-life there. Because both total and surface protein half-lives were decreased for Kv1.4N354Q, this suggested that both proteasomal and lysosomal pathways were involved. Another small ER Kv1.4354Q subpopulation appeared to be shuttled to aggresomes. This subpopulation of Kv1.4N354Q may have been shuttled to aggresomes because these proteins have misfolded; have not folded efficiently in a timely fashion; or have overloaded the ER but are not misfolded proteins (13Tamarappoo B.K. Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34825-34831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Wild type Kv1.1, which exhibited high partial ER retention similar to Kv1.4N354Q, did not induce aggresomes and appeared to be properly folded here (9Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These effects on trafficking for Kv1.4N354Q were somewhat similar to those reported for a Shaker K+ channel N-glycosylation mutant in mammalian cell lines (14Khanna R. Myers M.P. Laine M. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34028-34034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), except it was suggested that the decreased total protein half-life of the Shaker N-glycosylation mutant was mostly via the proteasomal pathway and not the lysosomal pathway. Effects of Glycosylation on the Protein Stability, Intracellular Localization, and Cell Surface Expression Levels of Kv1.1 or Kv1.4 Were Reversed by Exchanging Their Outer Pore Trafficking Determinant Regions—We have shown that trans-Golgi glycosylation and cell surface expression levels of Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 are a function of an outer pore region, because exchanging these determinants conferred upon the recipient channel the channel pore characteristics of the donor for these two parameters (9Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that these different pore regions may interact with unknown chaperone-like proteins associated with the ER and Golgi, which may act positively or negatively on the above parameters (9Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). What is the effect of N-glycosylation on the cell biology of chimeric Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 channels with their pore regions exchanged? We used Kv1.1 C1 (Kv1.1 with the pore region of Kv1.4) and Kv1.4 C2 (Kv1.4 with the outer pore region of Kv1.1) (Fig. 1C). There are only nine amino acid differences in the whole S5-pore-S6 region between these two wild type channels, and eight of them are in the outer pore region (Fig. 1D). Kv1.1 C1N207Q cell surface levels were only ∼50% of the level of control Kv1.1 C1 by both protein and Gm/Cm estimations (Fig. 6, A, lanes 1 and 2, and B), whereas Kv1.4C2N354Q cell surface levels were similar to Kv1.4C2 levels by protein estimations (Fig. 6, C, lanes 1 and 2, and D). However, it appeared that Kv1.4C2N354Q was relatively insensitive to depolarization and thus exhibited a low Gm/Cm versus Kv1.4C2 control, although the protein level was similar (Fig. 6, C and D). The explanation for this reduced functionality of Kv1.4C2N354Q is currently unknown. Immunofluorescence localization patterns for these chimeras in COS cells were also reversed; Kv1.1 C1N207Q showed an intracellular retention pattern, and Kv1.1 C1 did not, whereas Kv1.4 C2N354Q and Kv1.4 C2 both exhibited a similar cellular localization pattern indicative of high partial ER retention (Fig. 5, E–H). These results suggested that the Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 pore region trafficking determinants dictated the N-glycosylation effect on the cell biology of the channel. Possible Mechanism and Significance of the Effects of Glycosylation in K+Channel Trafficking—Glycosylation of membrane proteins is a common posttranslational modification, but the role that this processing plays in the function of glycoproteins appears to be variable (see Ref. 8Watanabe I. Wang H.G. Sutachan J.J. Zhu J. Recio-Pinto E. Thornhill W.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 550: 51-66Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, the role of glycosylation in the protein stability and trafficking of membrane proteins also appears to be variable, although glycosylation of secretory and membrane glycoproteins is generally thought to promote protein stability (15Lennarz W. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our study suggests that two K+ channels with high amino acid identity exhibited very different responses to N-glycosylation in regard to protein stability and trafficking. We speculate that Kv1.4 N-glycosylation plays an important role in promoting proper folding or timely protein folding in the ER and/or acting as an ER export signal for trafficking to the cell surface, as well as increasing protein stability, whereas this modification had little or no effect on these parameters for Kv1.1. Some Kv1.4N354Q ER proteins were apparently shuttled to aggresomes, whereas another population was transported to the cell surface and appeared to be functional, although its protein half-life was decreased there. It appears that Kv1.4 cell surface levels can be altered by multiple positive determinants such as a sugar tree addition (current study), a pore region determinant (9Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal motif (discussed in Refs. 9Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, and 16Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Kv1.1 surface levels appear to be controlled by a mostly negative determinant in the pore region that induces high ER retention (9Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the sugar tree addition has little or no effect on protein stability or surface levels. Interestingly, this glycosylation effect on surface levels was dependent on the wild type trafficking pore region determinant that we identified previously (9Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), because exchanging the pore region determinant between Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 reversed these effects. We speculate that the Kv1.4 pore and sugar tree show some type of dependence in promoting proper ER folding and/or ER export as well as trafficking to the cell surface, and this dependence can be transferred to chimeric Kv1.1 proteins that contain the pore of Kv1.4. In this regard, we have also shown for Kv1.4 that a cytoplasmic C-terminal trafficking determinant required the presence of the Kv1.4 pore region determinant to exert its effect (16Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the Kv1.4 pore determinant appears to be required for both the glycosylation effect on trafficking in our current study and the C-terminal determinant effect on trafficking in our previous study (16Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Kv1.1/Kv1.4 heteromers and Kv1.4 homomers are found in the brain (17Coleman S.K. Newcombe K. Pryke J. Dolly J.O. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and we have found previously that Kv1.1/Kv1.4 heteromers in cell lines show low cell surface levels versus Kv1.4 homomers, because Kv1.1 promoted high ER retention (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25558-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Lack of N-glycosylation could be a limiting factor for surface expression of Kv1.4 homomers in the brain if they are required at high surface expression levels in different neuronal populations or at distinct locations on a neuron. It is unknown whether differential glycosylation of Kv1.4, in different neuronal populations, might also affect surface expression levels. In any event, dysfunction in glycosylation potential, either by a mutation in a N-glycosylation site or by alterations in the glycoprotein processing machinery, would be predicted to affect the trafficking of Kv1.4 proteins, but it would have little effect on these parameters for Kv1.1 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2127964350,"Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been implicated in the regulation of neuronal excitability in many systems. Recent studies suggest that local regulation of membrane potential can have important computational consequences for neuronal function. In Drosophila, CaMKII regulates the eag potassium channel, but if and how this regulation was spatially restricted was unknown. Using coimmunoprecipitation from head extracts and in vitro binding assays, we show that CaMKII and Eag form a stable complex and that association with Eag activates CaMKII independently of CaM and autophosphorylation. Ca2+/CaM is necessary to initiate binding of CaMKII to Eag but not to sustain association because binding persists when CaM is removed. The Eag CaMKII-binding domain has homology to the CaMKII autoregulatory region, and the constitutively active CaMKII mutant, T287D, binds Eag Ca2+-independently in vitro and in vivo. These results favor a model in which the CaMKII-binding domain of Eag displaces the CaMKII autoinhibitory region. Displacement results in autophosphorylation-independent activation of CaMKII which persists even when Ca2+ levels have gone down. Activity-dependent binding to this potassium channel substrate allows CaMKII to remain locally active even when Ca2+ levels have dropped, providing a novel mechanism by which CaMKII can regulate excitability locally over long time scales.

These results favor a model in which the CaMKII-binding domain of Eag displaces the CaMKII autoinhibitory region. Displacement results in autophosphorylation-independent activation of CaMKII which persists even when Ca2+ levels have gone down. Activity-dependent binding to this potassium channel substrate allows CaMKII to remain locally active even when Ca2+ levels have dropped, providing a novel mechanism by which CaMKII can regulate excitability locally over long time scales. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) 1The abbreviations used are: CaMKII, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. has been shown to regulate ion channels and neuronal excitability in both vertebrates (1Sola C.

Regulation of excitability has been proposed as a mechanism by which neurons can globally modify their firing to keep spike rates in a scalable range in the presence of synapse-specific plasticity (12Turrigiano G.G. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 221-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 13Hansel C. Linden D.J. D'Angelo E. Nat.

A. 1996; 93: 13481-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Recently, it has become clear that regulation of excitability can also occur as a local phenomenon (15Johnston D. Christie B.R. Frick A. Gray R. Hoffman D.A. Schexnayder L.K. Watanabe S. Yuan L.L. Philos. Trans R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 16Yuan L.L. Adams J.P.

Regional changes in excitability mediated by differing levels of A-type potassium currents were shown to be important for gating Hebbian plasticity in CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites and limiting propagation of action potentials (19Hoffman D.A. Magee J.C. Colbert C.M. Johnston D. Nature. 1997; 387: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These effects have important implications for the computational abilities of neurons that integrate over many inputs. Both slow, expression level changes and fast, enzymatic modifications could underlie local phenomena, and in CA1, local regulation of excitability was associated with both regional differences in current density (19Hoffman D.A. Magee J.C. Colbert C.M. Johnston D. Nature. 1997; 387: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and region-specific post-translational modifications of ion channels (18Varga A.W. Anderson A.E. Adams J.P. Vogel H. Sweatt J.D. Learn Mem. 2000; 7: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fast modulation offers the advantage of dynamic retooling of the computational capability of the neuron. For signal transduction pathways to effect fast local changes in excitability, the activity of effector enzymes has to be spatially restricted. The ability of protein kinases with many substrates to act with specificity to regulate cellular functions is increasingly being ascribed to interactions with scaffolding molecules that bring kinases and their substrates into close proximity. Signaling platforms range from small complexes containing only a few proteins to very complex cellular specializations like the postsynaptic density of the mammalian central nervous system (20Kennedy M.B. Science. 2000; 290: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The advantages of scaffolding enzymes and substrates include enhancement of reaction rates because of elimination of diffusional barriers and increased local concentration of substrates and segregation of the enzyme to prevent reaction with other substrates. Localization of effector enzymes to sources of small molecule regulators can also establish very restricted signaling domains. Scaffolding may be particularly important for regulation of membrane-bound proteins in neurons; diffusion in the membrane bilayer is relatively slow, and the ability of soluble enzymes to access substrates can be influenced by the complex geometry of neurons. The regulation of firing in Drosophila motor axons involves the ether-à-go-go (eag) potassium channel. eag is the founding member of an evolutionarily conserved superfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels with homology to cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (21Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). In adult flies, mutation of eag causes ether-induced shaking (22Kaplan W.D. Trout W.E. Genetics. 1969; 61: 399-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and memory formation defects (7Griffith L.C. Wang J. Zhong Y. Wu C.F. Greenspan R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10044-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and in larvae, spontaneous axonally generated excitatory junctional potentials in the body wall muscle and supernumerary responses to nerve stimulation (23Wu C.F. Ganetzky B. Haugland F.N. Liu A.X. Science. 1983; 220: 1076-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Genetic interactions between eag and the CaMKII ala inhibitor peptide transgene suggested that CaMKII may be a regulator of Eag (7Griffith L.C. Wang J. Zhong Y. Wu C.F. Greenspan R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10044-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Biochemical and electrophysiological studies demonstrated that current amplitude is regulated by phosphorylation of Thr-787 by the kinase (11Wang Z. Wilson G.F. Griffith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24022-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate whether CaMKII can locally regulate Eag function. We find that, in addition to providing a scaffold for CaMKII, Eag is also an activator of the kinase. The interaction of these two proteins provides a localized source of CaMKII that remains active, in the absence of calcium, for the lifetime of the complex. Antibodies—Anti-CaMKII rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against the C-terminal 13 amino acids of the Drosophila CaMKII (24Griffith L.C. Greenspan R.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and against a GST fusion protein containing the CaMKII catalytic domain (25Long X. Griffith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40765-40776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Anti-CaMKII mouse monoclonal antibody (26Takamatsu Y. Kishimoto Y. Ohsako S. Brain Res. 2003; 974: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was a gift of Yoshiki Takamatsu (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience). Anti-Eag rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against the last 143 amino acids of Eag (amino acids 1032–1174) fused to GST. Eag antibodies were affinity purified on a maltose affinity column loaded with a fusion of maltose-binding protein and Eag(1032–1174). Other reagents used include 0.5 μg/ml biotinylated CaM (biotin-CaM, generated using NHS-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, anti-rabbit and anti-mouse), streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Cy5-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Plasmids and Construction—PCR products of Eag fragments, with the exception of Eag-C2 (11Wang Z. Wilson G.F. Griffith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24022-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), were cloned between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) to make GST fusion proteins. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) to produce point mutations in GST-Eag-C1. Bac-to-Bac pFastBac plasmids containing wild type CaMKII were a gift from Neal Waxham, University of Texas at Houston School of Medicine. Recombinant virus used for infection was produced using the pFastBac plasmid in monolayers of Sf21 cells as described by the manufacturer. All mutations were verified by sequencing (Brandeis Core Sequencing Facility). Fly Strains—Flies were grown on standard medium at 25 °C. Canton S was used as the wild type strain. Panneural expression was achieved by crossing the C155-GAL4 driver line (27Lin D.M. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 507-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) with either UAS-T287A, UAS-T287D (28Jin P. Griffith L.C. Murphey R.K. J.

Neurogenet. 2000; 13: 233-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). eagSC29 is a null allele and was a gift of Barry Ganetzky (University of Wisconsin, Madison). Coimmunoprecipitation from Fly Head Extracts—Flies were frozen in liquid N2 and decapitated by vortexing. Heads were separated from bodies with a sizing sieve. 90 μl of fly heads was homogenized in 500 μl of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% Triton X-100 with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and either 4 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA and 4 mm EGTA). After centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm, pellets were homogenized one more time. Combined supernatants and pellets were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged again. The supernatant was then incubated with 5 μl anti-Eag antibody at 4 °C for 1 h, and the immunocomplex was precipitated by incubating for another 1 h with 40 μl of 50% protein A/G-agarose slurry (Santa Cruz). After three washes with the solubilization buffer, proteins bound to beads were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The gel was cut into two halves; the upper half with proteins above 60 kDa was transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose at 230 mA for 40 min and probed with anti-Eag and the lower half transferred at 230 mA for 30 min and probed with biotin-CaM or mouse anti-CaMKII. Bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase for anti-Eag and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase for biotin-CaM) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—Overnight bacterial cultures of Escherichia coli BL21 transformed with the appropriate plasmid were diluted 1:100 in LB broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C until A600 = 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min. To purify proteins, 50-ml cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated on ice for 15 min. 1% Triton X-100 was added, and the mixture was sonicated for 5 × 10 s. After spinning at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer including 0.6% sarcosyl and incubated at 4 °C until clear; then 180 μl of 20% Triton X-100 was added. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads equilibrated with lysis buffer were added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h or overnight. Beads were washed with 10 volumes of buffer (0.2 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm Na3VO4) three times. Beads were then either washed twice with 20 mm sodium orthophosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.15 m NaCl for binding assay or eluted with freshly made elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 0.1 m NaCl and 20 mm reduced glutathione) followed by dialysis against 1 × phosphate-buffered saline with 10% glycerol to obtain soluble proteins. Expression and Purification of CaMKII—CaMKII was purified from cells utilizing a protocol adapted from Putkey and Waxham (30Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sf21 cells (a gift of Neal Waxham) at a density ≈ 1.5 × 106 were infected by baculovirus at a multiplicity between 2 and 10. Cell pellets collected after growing for 2–3 days were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were either frozen at –80 °C or resuspended immediately in 10 volumes of 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% betaine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 20 mg/liter leupeptin with 10 strokes of a glass/Teflon homogenizer and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The proteins were precipitated from the supernatant with ammonium sulfate (50% final), resuspended in starting buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm CaCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors), and applied to a CaM-Sepharose column. The column was washed with starting buffer, then starting buffer with 2 m NaCl instead of 0.15 m and washed then again with starting buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol and dialyzed into storage buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, 50% glycerol) then frozen as aliquots at –80 °C. Binding Assays with Immobilized GST Fusion Proteins—20-μl beads conjugated to GST-Eag fusion protein were incubated with 100 μl of binding mix (200 nm kinase, 50 mm PIPES, 15 mm MgCl2, 20 mm sodium orthophosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and either 1 mm CaCl2 and 3 μm CaM or 1 mm EGTA) at 4 °C for 1–2 h. Beads were then washed with 10 volumes of buffer (50 mm PIPES, 15 mm MgCl2, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA or 1 mm CaCl2 and 3 μm CaM as indicated) three or four times. Eag-bound CaMKII was eluted by boiling in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer followed by separation using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-CaMKII antibodies. Kinase Activity and Protein Phosphorylation Assay—Wild type CaMKII or the T287A mutant was bound to immobilized GST-Eag-C2, and CaM was removed with EGTA washes. The activity of soluble or Eag-bound kinase was assayed as described previously (31Wang Z. Palmer G. Griffith L.C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CaMKII, GST-Eag, or CaMKII bound to Eag was phosphorylated in an assay reaction of 50 μl containing 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1 Ci/mmol). Reactions were started by the addition of hot ATP and run at 30 °C for 1 min and stopped by adding 50 μl of 2× SDS sample loading buffer. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 3 min before separation by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Immunohistochemistry—Third instar larval brains were dissected and stained as described previously (32Park D. Coleman M.J. Hodge J.J.L. Budnik V. Griffith L.C. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 52: 24-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Images were acquired using the 20× objective of a Leica TCS SP2 confocal scanning microscope. Eag and CaMKII Coimmunoprecipitate in a Calcium-dependent Manner from Drosophila Heads—Eag is a substrate of CaMKII in vitro and in vivo (7Griffith L.C. Wang J. Zhong Y. Wu C.F. Greenspan R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10044-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Wang Z. Wilson G.F. Griffith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24022-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether these two proteins were part of a stable signaling complex, we immunoprecipitated Eag from extracts of adult Drosophila heads, separated the precipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE, and probed for CaMKII using either mouse anti-CaMKII (Fig. 1A, top panel) or biotin-CaM overlay (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). CaMKII is coimmunoprecipitated with Eag from wild type flies, whereas immunoprecipitates from eagsc29 flies, which do not express any Eag protein or mRNA (33Drysdale R. Warmke J. Kreber R. Ganetzky B. Genetics. 1991; 127: 497-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), do not contain CaMKII. The ability to bring down CaMKII was enhanced by homogenizing tissue in a buffer containing calcium. In the top panel of Fig. 1A, immunoprecipitations were done in the presence of calcium. In the bottom panel immunoprecipitation from calcium-containing extracts was compared with pull-down from extracts made in the presence of EGTA and EDTA. The multiple bands detected in the 50-kDa range by mouse anti-CaMKII and biotin-CaM overlay likely correspond to different alternative splice isoforms of CaMKII (24Griffith L.C. Greenspan R.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Eag Is a Synaptic Protein in Drosophila Central Neurons—To determine whether Eag is present in neurons and at synapses, we stained third instar larval brains with antibodies directed against Eag. Although Eag has been studied in Drosophila for many years, its distribution has not been described previously. Fig. 1B (left panel) shows wild type and eagsc29 brains stained for Eag. Staining is seen primarily in the neuropil (synaptic area) and axon tracts in the wild type animal, with no staining in eagsc29 brains, which do not express Eag. Colocalization of Eag staining with the synaptic marker GFP-nSyb (29Estes P.S. Ho G.L. Narayanan R. Ramaswami M. J. Neurogenet. 2000; 13: 233-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which is expressed under control of the panneural C155-GAL4, demonstrates that Eag is present at neuronal synapses (Fig. 1B, right panel). The synaptic localization of Eag puts it in the same cellular compartment as CaMKII, which has been shown to be a synaptic protein in both vertebrates (34Kennedy M.B. Bennett M.K. Erondu N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7357-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and invertebrates (26Takamatsu Y. Kishimoto Y. Ohsako S. Brain Res. 2003; 974: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CaMKII Requires Ca2+/CaM to Initiate, but Not Sustain, Binding to Eag—The calcium-dependent interaction of CaMKII with Eag was investigated further using an in vitro binding assay. Purified CaMKII (R3 isoform) was mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads that had been conjugated to a GST fusion protein containing the entire cytoplasmic C terminus, amino acids 556–1174, of Eag (GST-Eag-C2) in the presence of Ca2+/CaM or EGTA, and washed with buffers containing Ca2+/CaM, Ca2+, or EGTA as indicated. Beads conjugated to GST were used as a control for nonspecific binding. In other experiments, the cytoplasmic N terminus of Eag was found not to interact with CaMKII (data not shown). Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and CaMKII and CaM detected by immunoblotting. In Fig. 2 it can be seen that CaMKII cannot associate with GST-Eag-C2 when there is no Ca2+/CaM in the binding buffer. If allowed to interact initially in Ca2+/CaM-containing buffer, washes with Ca2+ alone allow both CaMKII and CaM to remain bound. Once formed, the CaMKII·Eag complex is stable even after EGTA washes, which effectively strip CaM from the complex. GST alone does not bind CaMKII even in the presence of Ca2+/CaM. Consistent with the in vivo coimmunoprecipitation result that multiple isoforms of CaMKII appeared to associate with Eag, in vitro binding assays also showed that all tested CaMKII isoforms (R1, R2, R3, R3A, R4, R5, and R6; see Ref. 24Griffith L.C. Greenspan R.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) can interact with GST-Eag-C2 in the presence of Ca2+/CaM but not when bound in an EGTA buffer (data not shown). Deletion Mapping Defines the CaMKII-binding site on Eag— Deletion analysis was used to define the minimal region of GST-Eag-C2 necessary to bind to CaMKII (Fig. 3). CaMKII was bound in the presence of Ca2+/CaM and beads washed with a Ca2+-containing buffer. Bound CaMKII was detected by immunoblotting. Binding ability mapped to amino acids 772–803 of the C terminus (Fig. 3, B and C). A further truncation to 794 (data not shown) was also found to bind CaMKII. Sequence analysis revealed a high degree of homology to the CaMKII autoinhibitory domain over the amino acids 773–794 region (see Fig. 6A). In CaMKII, this domain interacts directly with the catalytic domain of the kinase to suppress activity (35Soderling T.R. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1993; 18: 185-200PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of CaM to the kinase disrupts this interaction and allows substrate access and autophosphorylation. This suggests that Eag may bind to the CaMKII catalytic domain on the interaction face used by the autoregulatory domain of the kinase itself. This mechanism of kinase binding is similar to that demonstrated for the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit (36Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar).Fig. 6Mapping of residues critical for the interaction of CaMKII with Eag. A, interaction of Eag point mutants with wild type CaMKII. Top panel, homology between Eag CaMKII-binding domain and the autoinhibitory domain of CaMKII is shown by boxed residues. Dots indicate residues of CaMKII which have been shown to be important for the interaction of the autoinhibitory domain and catalytic domains (42Yang E. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26199-26208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Amino acids in GST-Eag-C1 were mutated individually (*) or in pairs (*). Middle panel, CaMKII binding was performed as in Fig. 3C. Bottom panel, Coomassie staining is shown to demonstrate equivalent loading of Eag fusion proteins onto glutathione-Sepharose beads.

CaMKII was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads conjugated to GST-Eag-C2 in the presence of Ca2+/CaM or EGTA and washed with buffer containing either Ca2+ or EGTA corresponding to the initial condition. Bound kinase was detected by immunoblotting with anti-CaMKII (1:1,000). WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Direct Binding of CaM to Eag Is Not Required for CaMKII Binding or Phosphorylation—Ca2+/CaM could exert its positive effects on the CaMKII/Eag interaction either by binding to CaMKII or to Eag. Human hEAG1 has been shown to be inhibited by direct Ca2+/CaM binding (37Schonherr R. Lober K. Heinemann S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3263-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Drosophila Eag has very high homology to hEAG1 over this region (amino acids 725–744), which is just proximal to the CaMKII-binding site (Fig. 4A). Association of CaM with GST-Eag-C1 can be completely blocked by mutations of critical phenylalanines in this motif to serine (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). Three lines of evidence indicate that direct binding of CaM to the Eag C terminus is not required for binding of CaMKII. First, deletion analysis (Fig. 3) indicates that this CaM-binding site is not involved in Ca2+/CaM-dependent CaMKII binding. If the CaM-binding region of Eag is disrupted (GST-Eag 731–803; data not shown) or entirely removed (GST-Eag 761–803) CaMKII still binds normally. Second, wild type CaMKII binds to F732S/F735S GST-Eag-C1 (data not shown), even though this Eag mutant does not bind CaM. Third, mutant CaMKIIs that are constitutively in the activated state (T287D mutation) bind to Eag in the absence of Ca2+/CaM (see Fig. 5A below). Although not required for kinase binding, it was still possible that interaction of the CaM- and CaMKII-binding sites could regulate phosphorylation of Thr-787, the major CaMKII site on Eag (11Wang Z. Wilson G.F. Griffith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24022-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). CaM binding to a substrate protein has been shown to regulate site availability both positively (38Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and negatively (39Hashimoto Y. King M.M. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7001-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We measured radioactive phosphate transfer from [γ-32P]ATP into wild type GST-Eag-C1 and F732S/F735S GST-Eag-C1. These mutations have been shown in hEAG1 to block CaM binding (37Schonherr R. Lober K. Heinemann S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3263-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and they also block CaM binding to the Drosophila Eag C terminus (Fig. 4A). Wild type CaMKII was able to phosphorylate both wild type and mutant Eag to similar levels in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, but not in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 4B, top panels). This demonstrates that CaM binding to Eag is not necessary for Thr-787 phosphorylation. T287D CaMKII, which is constitutively active, was able to phosphorylate Thr-787 to the same level in both the presence and absence of CaM (Fig. 4B, bottom panels), demonstrating that direct binding of CaM to Eag does not inhibit Thr-787 phosphorylation. We conclude that the binding of CaM to Eag neither enhances nor suppresses phosphorylation or CaMKII binding. Activation of CaMKII Is Necessary for Eag Binding—Ruling out a"

In this study, we further explored the role of plasminogen activation in cell adhesion and survival and show that uncontrolled plasminogen activation at the cell surface may induce cell detachment and apoptosis. We hypothesized that this process could be prevented in adherent cells by expression of protease nexin-1, a potent serpin able to inhibit thrombin, plasmin, and plasminogen activators. Using two- and three-dimensional culture systems, we demonstrate that Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts constitutively express tissue-type plasminogen activator and efficiently activate exogenously added plasminogen in a specific and saturable manner (Km = 46 nm). The formation of plasmin results in proteolysis of fibronectin and laminin, which is followed by cell detachment and apoptosis. Protease nexin-1 expressed by transfected cells significantly inhibited the activity of plasmin and tissue-type plasminogen activator via the formation of inhibitory complexes and prevented cell detachment and apoptosis. In conclusion, protease nexin-1 may be an important anti-apoptotic factor for adherent cells. This cell model could be a useful tool to evaluate therapeutic agents such as serpins in vascular pathologies involving pericellular protease-protease inhibitor imbalance.

This cell model could be a useful tool to evaluate therapeutic agents such as serpins in vascular pathologies involving pericellular protease-protease inhibitor imbalance. Apoptosis of adherent cells induced by disruption of integrin-mediated cell-matrix interactions, referred to as anoikis, has been described in physiological conditions such as the renewal of intestinal epithelial cells and the involution of the mammary gland after lactation (for a review, see Ref. 1Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that resistance to anoikis may also contribute to the progression of malignancy (2Frisch S.M. Screaton R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Therefore, definition of the intracellular events and extracellular mediators involved in pathological anoikis could be helpful to define therapeutic targets. The intracellular pathways involved in anoikis have been extensively studied and include Bcl-2-related proteins (3Frisch S.M. Francis H. J.

It has been shown, however, that growth factors (such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and epidermal growth factor) and their receptors cooperate with integrins to trigger different intracellular survival signaling pathways (2Frisch S.M.

We hypothesized that pericellular plasmin generation could trigger anoikis of adherent cells and sought to demonstrate that inhibition of plasmin formation by transfection of serpins (serine proteinase inhibitors) would prevent this phenomenon.

J. Exp. Med. 1958; 108: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) constitutively express tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) able to convert exogenously added plasminogen into plasmin. The pericellular generated plasmin induces cleavage of adhesive glycoproteins, followed by CHO-K1 cell detachment and apoptosis. We further show that gene transfer and expression of PN-1 or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) inhibited plasminogen activation-induced anoikis of CHO-K1 cells. The chromogenic substrate CBS0065 ((methylmalonyl)hydroxyproly-larginine-p-nitroanilide) was purchased from Stago (Asnières, France), aprotinin (Trasylol®) from Bayer, and plastic cell culture dishes from TPP (Trasadingen, Switzerland). Goat anti-human t-PA polyclonal antibody was obtained from Biopool (Uppsala, Sweden). Rabbit anti-human fibronectin and anti-mouse laminin polyclonal antibodies were kindly provided by H. P. Erickson (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). Recombinant rat PN-1 and anti-rat PN-1 monoclonal antibody 4B3 (33Sommer J. Meyhack B. Rovelli G. Buergi R. Monard D. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were kind gifts of D. Monard (Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland). Other products were obtained as described previously (34Hervio L. Chapman M.J. Thillet J. Loyau S. Anglés-Cano E. Blood. 1993; 82: 392-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human Glu-plasminogen was purified as described (35Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar) with modifications and was considered to be >99% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequence analysis (36Edman P. Henschen A. Needleman S.B. Protein Sequence Determination. Springer Publishing Co., New York1975: 232-279Google Scholar). Human α-thrombin was obtained as reported previously (37Bezeaud A. Denninger M.H. Guillin M.-C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was calculated using molecular masses and extinction coefficients (∈280 nm, 1 cm1%) of 93 kDa and 16.8 for plasminogen and 36 kDa and 1.83 for α-thrombin. Elastase-derived plasminogen fragments K1+2+3+4 (the first four kringles) and K5-SP (kringle-5 and the serine protease domain) were prepared according to Sottrup-Jensen et al. (38Sottrup-Jensen L. Claeys H. Zajdel M. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Prog. Chem. Fibrinolysis Thrombolysis. 1978; 3: 191-209Google Scholar). Recombinant plasminogen with Ser741 mutagenized to Ala (rPg-S741A) was obtained as described elsewhere (39Busby S.J. Mulvihill E. Rao D. Kumar A.A. Lioubin P. Heipel M. Sprecher C. Halfpap L.

CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection CCL-61) were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 using Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum under two- and three-dimensional conditions. Three-dimensional collagen matrix gel culture was performed as described (11Davis G.E. Pintar Allen K.A. Salazar R. Maxwell S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 917-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Schechner J.S. Nath A.K. Zheng L. Kluger M.S. Hughes C.C. Sierra-Honigmann M.R. Lorber M.I. Tellides G. Kashgarian M. Bothwell A.L.

Briefly, plastic 24-well culture plates were loaded with 175 μl of a solution of 0.5 mg/ml collagen and 40 μg/ml fibronectin in Ham’s F-12 medium, and gelation was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C. Serum-starved wild-type or sham- or PN-1-transfected CHO-K1 cells were isolated from culture flasks, resuspended in the collagen/fibronectin solution, and overlaid onto pre-gelled wells (250,000 cells in 175 μl/well). Medium (200 μl/well) was added after gelation, and the cultures were incubated as described above. The collagen solution and medium were supplemented with 1 μm plasminogen (final concentration) when indicated. The cDNA coding sequence for rat PN-1 preceded by a Kozak consensus translation initiation site (41Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) was inserted as an EcoRI/XbaI fragment into a pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The complete PN-1 coding sequence was built up by ligating, at the SphI restriction site, the 3′-end fragment of the rat PN-1 cDNA with a reverse transcription-PCR product coding for the missing 5′-end fragment. The 3′-end cDNA fragment was excised from the 1468-bp XhoI/XbaI cDNA probe (42Mansuy I.M. van der Putten H. Schmid P. Meins M. Botteri F.M. Monard D. Development. 1993; 119: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-end fragment was amplified from rat brain cDNA with primers 5′-GAATTCGCCACCATGAATTGGCATTTTCCCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCATCACCGTTGAGAGCTGCTTCTTCGTC-3′ (antisense), subcloned in the pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega), and inserted as an EcoRI/SphI fragment. The pcDNA3 vector containing the complete PN-1 coding sequence or an empty pcDNA3 vector (sham) was transfected into CHO-K1 cells seeded in 75-cm culture flasks or on 96-well plastic plates and cultured as described above. The transfection procedure was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. CHO-K1 cells overexpressing human active PAI-1 were obtained and cultured as described (43Alessi M.C. Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Nelles L. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The secreted PAI-1 has very similar or identical physicochemical and functional properties compared with natural PAI-1 (43Alessi M.C. Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Nelles L. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Wild-type and sham- and PN-1-transfected CHO-K1 cells cultured as described above were starved of serum for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with varying concentrations of either plasminogen or rPg-S741A (100 μl/well) supplemented with inhibitors when indicated. In experiments aimed at neutralizing expressed PN-1, varying concentrations of α-thrombin were incubated with cells for the 24-h period of serum deprivation following the transfection procedure. Residual thrombin was inhibited with a 10-fold excess of hirudin (Stago) prior to the addition of plasminogen. The kinetics of plasmin formation at 37 °C were monitored by measuring the rate of p-nitroaniline release from the chromogenic substrate CBS0065 (0.75 mm final concentration). The change in absorbance at 405 nm as a function of time (18 h) was monitored using a Dynex MR5000 multiwell plate reader. The plate was then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 0.75 mm CBS0065 (100 μl/well) was added to detect cell-bound plasmin. In three-dimensional cultures, plasmin was detected in the conditioned medium after 48 h of incubation with 1 μm plasminogen supplemented with 80 mm ∈-aminocaproic acid or 0.5 μm α2-antiplasmin when indicated. Rates of p-nitroaniline release were transformed to femtomoles of plasmin as described (44Fleury V. Lijnen H.R. Anglés-Cano E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18554-18559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of α-Thrombin Activity and Formation of Complexes with 125I-Labeled α-Thrombin—To detect PN-1, cell-free conditioned medium from sham- or PN-1-transfected CHO-K1 cells was incubated with α-thrombin at varying concentrations for 15 min at 37 °C. Thrombin inhibition was checked by measuring residual thrombin using the chromogenic substrate CBS0065. Alternatively, the conditioned medium was incubated with 5 nm 125I-labeled α-thrombin, and the formation of complexes with PN-1 was detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (31Bouton M.-C. Richard B. Rossignol P. Philippe M. Guillin M.-C. Michel J.-B. Jandrot-Perrus M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Free PN-1 was also detected by Western blotting of the culture supernatant using anti-rat PN-1 monoclonal antibody 4B3 as described below. Immunocapture and Immunoblot Analysis—Following plasminogen activation experiments, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was removed by aspiration; and similar amounts of protein (Bradford protein assay) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies immobilized on beads coated with either protein A (Amersham Biosciences) or goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dynal, Inc.) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The antibodies used were goat anti-human t-PA polyclonal IgG antibody and monoclonal antibody CPL15 (45Montes R. Paramo J.A. Anglés-Cano E. Rocha E. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 92: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) directed against kringle-1 of plasmin(ogen), respectively. The beads were then washed, resuspended in 25 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris base, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation, proteins in a final volume of 20 μl were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was saturated for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and 0.1% Tween 20, and finally incubated for 2 h with monoclonal antibody 4B3 (specific for rat PN-1) (31Bouton M.-C. Richard B. Rossignol P. Philippe M. Guillin M.-C. Michel J.-B. Jandrot-Perrus M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The membrane was then washed with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1500). After five washes, the signal was detected using a chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). After 24 h (two-dimensional) or 48 h (three-dimensional) of incubation with plasminogen and other reagents, CHO-K1 cells were washed with PBS and submitted to various tests for the detection of cell survival and apoptosis. Replating of Cells—Control cells (detached by incubation with 0.02% Versene (Invitrogen) for 5 min at 37 °C) and plasmin-detached cells (also incubated with Versene) were washed with Ham’s F-12 medium, resuspended in medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and replated for 60 min. The proportion of dead cells in the suspension of detached cells was quantitated by phase-contrast microscopy of trypan blue exclusion by living cells in a 1:1 mixture with trypan blue (Invitrogen). Cell Detachment Assay—CHO-K1 cells in two-dimensional cultures were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the tetrazolium salt 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 0.5 mg/ml) in PBS (46Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4353) Google Scholar). Detached cells were discarded, and the remaining living adherent cells formed formazan crystals, which were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and colorimetrically detected at A550 nm using a multiwell plate reader. Absorbance readings are proportional to the number of living cells. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) and 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) Staining—To visualize DNA fragmentation, cells grown on 4-well slide chambers (Labtech) or cells cytospun from collagenase-digested three-dimensional cultures were submitted to TUNEL (Roche Applied Science) and DAPI (Sigma) nuclear counterstaining according to the manufacturers’ instructions. After washing, the slides were mounted with Fluoprep (Dako), and positivity was counted using an epifluorescence microscope. The apoptotic index was calculated as the percentage of TUNEL-positive nuclei relative to total DAPI-stained nuclei. Quantitation of DNA Fragments and Caspase Activity—Histone-associated DNA fragments were quantified using a photometric enzyme immunoassay (Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS, Roche Applied Science) (47Adderley S.R. Fitzgerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) following the manufacturer’s procedure. Caspase-3 activity was assessed using a selective chromogenic substrate (DVED-p-nitroanilide, R&D Systems) (47Adderley S.R. Fitzgerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Fibrin zymography was performed as described previously (48Gaussem P. Grailhe P. Anglés-Cano E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12150-12155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples prepared as described below were electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. The SDS was then exchanged with 2.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, and the gel was carefully overlaid on a fibrin-agarose gel containing 100 μg/ml IgG directed against t-PA when indicated or, for reverse fibrin zymography, 0.5 IU/ml urokinase. Zymograms were incubated at 37 °C and regularly photographed over a period of 4–24 h. MMP-9 activity in the conditioned medium was quantified as described previously (49Badier-Commander C.

PAI-1 and t-PA·PAI-1 complexes were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described previously (50Declerck P.J. Collen D. Thromb. Res. 1990; 10: 3-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using Statview Version 5.0 software. Results are expressed as the means ± S.D. unless otherwise stated. Comparisons used one-way analysis of variance with Scheffe’s F test or Wilcoxon signed ranks as appropriate. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Wild-type CHO-K1 Cells Are Able to Activate Plasminogen— Plasminogen incubated with wild-type CHO-K1 cells was activated in a saturable and specific manner (Vmax = 17.6 nmol/min, Km = 46 nm) (Fig. 1). rPg-S741A, which is an inactive catalytic site mutant, could be converted to a two-chain molecule, but no degradation of the chromogenic substrate CBS0065 was detected, thus indicating absence of activity. The activator, constitutively expressed by wild-type CHO-K1 cells, was identified as t-PA by (i) the inhibition in cell lysates by specific anti-t-PA polyclonal IgG antibodies (Fig. 2, inset B) of a fibrin zymography lysis band corresponding to the molecular mass of t-PA (Fig. 2, inset A) and (ii) the inhibition of plasminogen activation by 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone (IC50 = 2nm), a selective inhibitor for t-PA. No fibrinolytic band was apparent in zymograms of the conditioned medium from 24-h two-dimensional cell cultures, indicating that cell-associated t-PA was converting plasminogen into plasmin at the cell membrane. Plasmin formation was indeed inhibited by the lysine analog ∈-aminocaproic acid (IC50 = 0.21 mm), further confirming that plasminogen activation occurred at the cell surface after binding to C-terminal lysine residues of membrane glycoproteins. The amount of plasmin bound to cells increased as a function of the concentration of plasminogen added (Fig. 1, inset) and was progressively released into the supernatant, where it could be specifically inhibited by α2-antiplasmin (IC50 = 1.4 nm) (Fig. 2). CHO-K1 cells in three-dimensional cultures expressed t-PA (detected in the conditioned medium at 48 h), activated plasminogen, and produced an amount of plasmin (40 nm at 48 h) that could be inhibited by α2-antiplasmin (500 nm final concentration); plasmin formation was prevented by 80 mm ∈-aminocaproic acid.Fig. 2Plasmin generation by wild-type CHO-K1 cells is mediated by t-PA and inhibited by α2-antiplasmin. The graph shows the activation of 1 μm plasminogen by wild-type CHO-K1 cells (performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1) either preincubated for 15 min with 0–50 μm 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone (▪) or in the presence of varying concentrations of α2-antiplasmin added to plasminogen (•). Results are expressed as a percentage (means ± S.D.) relative to the amount of plasmin converted from plasminogen in the absence of inhibitor (considered as 100%). Insets A and B show lysates from serum-starved CHO-K1 cells separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. After exchange of SDS with Triton X-100 and washing, the gel was overlaid onto a fibrin-agarose gel. Purified t-PA and u-PA were used as positive controls. Fibrinolytic activity was detected as lysis areas (inset A) after overnight incubation at 37 °C. The presence of anti-t-PA IgG antibodies (100 μg/ml) in the gel (inset B) inhibited the band present in the cell lysate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Proteolysis of natural substrates by plasmin was demonstrated. After a 18-h incubation with 500 nm plasminogen, both fibronectin (Fig. 3, left panel) and laminin (data not shown) were degraded, and pro-MMP-9 expressed by CHO-K1 cells was activated in a dose-dependent manner (right panel). Cellular Plasminogen Activation Induces Cell Detachment— Plasminogen activation by wild-type CHO-K1 cells was followed by cell shrinkage and detachment, which occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner (between 12 and 24 h) in two-dimensional cultured cells (Fig. 4A). An inverse linear correlation was observed between the amount of cell-generated plasmin and the percentage of remaining viable adherent cells (r = 0.987) as assessed by the MTT test. From the data presented in Fig. 4 and the microscopic observation of cells in experiments parallel to those shown in Fig. 2, it was concluded that cell detachment was directly dependent on both binding of plasminogen to cells and the proteolytic activity of plasmin. Cell detachment was indeed prevented by ∈-aminocaproic acid and 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone. In contrast, the mini-plasminogen (kringle-5 and the serine protease domain, K5-SP), which lacks the high affinity lysine-binding sites present in kringle-1 and kringle-4; the isolated fragment K1+2+3+4, which lacks the proteolytic region; and rPg-S741A were not able to induce any significant cell detachment (Fig. 4A). CHO-K1 cells seeded in three-dimensional collagen matrices appeared as single rounded isolated cells that underwent major morphological events, including sprouting with growth cone-like projections and branching upon 48–72 h of culture (Fig. 4B, upper panel). The addition of 1 μm plasminogen to the three-dimensional gels resulted in regression of the morphogenic changes, i.e. the cells remained rounded and presented vacuolization, membrane blebbing, and no further evidence of morphogenesis (Fig. 4B, lower panel). These plasmin(ogen)-induced effects were prevented by ∈-aminocaproic acid and α2-antiplasmin, thus indicating that cleavage of adhesive glycoproteins by plasmin induced the detachment of cells. Activation by plasmin of pro-MMP-9 expressed by CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 3) did not contribute significantly to cell detachment, as the incubation of cells with up to 200 μm GM6001, a broad-range synthetic inhibitor of MMPs, did not prevent cell detachment (data not shown). At 60 h of treatment with 500 nm plasminogen, all adherent cells were detached. Us"

Cellular features of BS include an accumulation of abnormal replication intermediates and increased sister chromatid exchange. Although it has been suggested that the underlying defect responsible for hyper-recombination in BS cells is a temporal delay in the maturation of DNA replication intermediates, the precise role of the BS gene product, BLM, in DNA metabolism remains elusive. We report here a novel interaction of the BLM protein with the human 5′-flap endonuclease/5′-3′ exonuclease (FEN-1), a genome stability factor involved in Okazaki fragment processing and DNA repair. BLM protein stimulates both the endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic cleavage activity of FEN-1 and this functional interaction is independent of BLM catalytic activity. BLM and FEN-1 are associated with each other in human nuclei as shown by their reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation from HeLa nuclear extracts. The BLM-FEN-1 physical interaction is mediated through a region of the BLM C-terminal domain that shares homology with the FEN-1 interaction domain of the Werner syndrome protein, a RecQ helicase family member homologous to BLM. This study provides the first evidence for a direct interaction of BLM with a human nucleolytic enzyme.

Ellis N.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Molecular and Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York2000: 733-752Google Scholar). Cells from BS patients exhibit hyper-recombination (2Chaganti R.S. Schonberg S. German J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4508-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) and abnormalities in DNA replication that include an extended S phase and accumulation of an abnormal profile of replication intermediates compared with normal cells (3Gianneli F.

Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3141-3145PubMed Google Scholar). BS cells exhibit chromosomal instability characterized by elevated rates of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), insertions, deletions, loss of heterozygosity, telomere associations, and quadriradials (for review, see Ref. 5Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Despite the interest in the molecular pathology of BS, the fundamental defects underlying the genomic instability and cellular dysfunction characteristic of the disease are poorly understood.The gene mutated in BS, designated BLM, encodes a 1417 amino acid protein with a central region (residues 649–1000) containing seven conserved motifs characteristic of DNA helicases (6Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). The region of BLM that contains these seven motifs exhibits ∼40% homology to other proteins in the RecQ family of DNA helicases. A 150 amino acid region of extended homology C-terminal to the helicase domain is found in most, but not all, RecQ helicases. Other members of the RecQ helicase family include Escherichia coli RecQ (7Nakayama K. Irino N. Nakayama H. Mol. Gen.

Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Of the human RecQ homologs, three, including BLM, are associated with genetic disorders characterized by chromosomal instability. The WRN gene is mutated in Werner syndrome, a premature aging disorder with elevated cancer risk (11Yu C.E. Oshima J. Fu Y.H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Nakura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G.D. Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). Mutations in the RecQ4 gene have been found in persons with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, another rare premature aging and cancer-predisposition disorder (12Kitao S. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Miller R.W. Smithson W.A. Lindor N.M. Furuichi Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The linkage of mutations in human RecQ helicases with genomic instability, cancer, and premature aging suggests that this class of enzymes have important caretaker roles in specialized pathways of DNA metabolism (5Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar).The BLM protein is a DNA-dependent ATPase and unwinds B-form DNA in a 3′ to 5′ direction with respect to the strand that the helicase is presumed to translocate on (13Karow J.K.

J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition, BLM resides in complexes containing caretaker proteins that include BRCA1, ATM, MRE11-RAD50-NBS1, and Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins (31Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J.

Based on the diverse set of DNA substrates upon which BLM can act and the multiple protein interactions involving BLM, it seems likely that BLM protein may serve multiple roles in DNA metabolism in vivo.Recently, we characterized interactions of WRN protein with two human members of the Rad2 nuclease family, FEN-1 (33Brosh Jr., R.M.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5027-5031PubMed Google Scholar). WRN stimulates FEN-1 cleavage activity by a physical interaction with a C-terminal domain of the WRN protein that shares sequence homology with the BLM protein (34Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The sequence homology between BLM and WRN in the region that mediates the physical and functional interaction between WRN and FEN-1/EXO-1 may point to a similar biochemical function of BLM to stimulate the Rad2 nuclease cleavage reaction. One hypothesis is that WRN or BLM may share responsibility of functioning with the Rad2 nucleases during replication to ensure efficient and accurate processing of specific DNA structures that arise during DNA synthesis. Alternatively, WRN and BLM may have separate roles in their interactions with cellular DNA nucleases, such as FEN-1 or EXO-1, that contribute to their unique forms of genomic instability as well as their distinctive cellular and clinical phenotypes. These two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive.FEN-1 haploinsufficiency in mice can lead to tumor progression (43Kucherlapati M. Yang K. Kuraguchi M. Zhao J. Lia M. Heyer J. Kane M.F. Fan K. Russell R. Brown A.M. Kneitz B. Edelmann W. Kolodner R.D. Lipkin M. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9924-9929Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), suggesting that FEN-1, like BLM, is a tumor suppressor (44Henneke G. Friedrich-Heineken E. Hubscher U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 384-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cancer predisposition and replication defects of BS may be at least partially explained by the lack of a BLM-FEN-1 interaction, since FEN-1 has an essential role in DNA replication and repair. Evidence is presented in this study that BLM and FEN-1 are associated in a complex in human cells as demonstrated by their reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation. Purified recombinant BLM protein interacts physically with human FEN-1, and stimulates FEN-1 cleavage activities on 5′-flap and nicked duplex DNA substrates that are proposed intermediates in DNA replication and repair. The functional interaction is mediated by a C-terminal region of BLM that shares homology with the domain of WRN responsible for the physical/functional interaction with FEN-1/EXO-1. The physical and functional interaction of human RecQ helicases, including BLM and WRN, with human Rad2 nucleases is likely to be important for the roles of these proteins in the maintenance of genome stability.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteins—Hexahistidine-tagged recombinant human BLM protein was overexpressed in S. cerevisiae and purified as described elsewhere (18Karow J.K. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 597-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). MBP fusion peptides of BLM were expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells and purified as described previously (28Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.-F. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9639-9644Google Scholar). Recombinant histidine-tagged WRN protein was overexpressed using a baculovirus/Sf9 insect system and purified as described elsewhere (34Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).FEN-1, encoded by a plasmid kindly provided by Dr. M. Lieber (University of Southern California), was overexpressed in E. coli by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) induction of mid-log phase cells for 4 h at 37 °C. The bacterial cell pellet (10 g) containing overexpressed FEN-1 protein was resuspended in 50 ml of FEN-1 Purification Buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysozyme was added to a concentration of 100 μg/ml, and the lysate was incubated on ice for 20 min. The suspension was then sonicated briefly, quickly frozen on dry ice, and allowed to thaw on ice, before clarification by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Imidazole (5 mm final concentration) was added to the supernatant, and the material was loaded onto a 5 ml HisTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) using an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed successively with FEN-1 Purification Buffer containing 40 and 100 mm imidazole, respectively. FEN-1 was eluted with FEN-1 Purification Buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Fractions collected were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and those fractions containing FEN-1 were pooled and dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Aliquots of recombinant FEN-1 were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. The purified FEN-1 recombinant protein was judged to be 98% pure from analysis on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels.BLM-FEN-1 Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. GM08505, an SV40-transformed fibroblast cell line from a Bloom’s syndrome patient obtained from Coriell Institute for Medical Research, was grown in MEM-Eagle supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Nuclear extracts were prepared from exponentially growing HeLa and GM08505 cells as described previously (45Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, nuclear extract (1 mg of protein) was incubated with either rabbit polyclonal anti-FEN-1 antibody (1: 400, Ref. 34Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A.

Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.-F. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9639-9644Google Scholar) in buffer D (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol) for 4 h at 4 °C. The mixture was subsequently tumbled with 20 μl of protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then washed three times with buffer D supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20. Proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and half of the eluate was resolved on 10% polyacrylamide Tris-glycine SDS gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, and probed for BLM and FEN-1 using IHIC33 (1:500) and anti-FEN-1 (1:5000) rabbit polyclonal antibodies, respectively, followed by detection with a goat-anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). BLM and FEN-1 on immunoblots were detected using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences).MBP-BLM-Amylose Pull-down Experiments—Maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion peptides were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (New England Biolabs) transformed with the pMAL-C2 expression plasmids containing various portions of the BLM cDNA (MBP-BLM-(1–447), MBP-BLM-(966–1417)) (28Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.-F. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9639-9644Google Scholar). BL21(DE3) cells transformed with plasmids encoding MBP or MBP-HuR (kind gift from Dr. M. Gorospe, NIA, NIH) were used for control experiments. Overnight transformed bacterial cultures were used to inoculate 50 ml of LB supplemented with 2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin at a 1:100 dilution, and the cultures were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of ∼0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cultures were allowed to grow for 3 h before being chilled on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm in a Beckman JA10 rotor, the cell pellet was resupended in 1 ml of Lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at the manufacturer’s recommended concentration. Cells were lysed by sonication and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 42,000 rpm in a Beckman 70 TI rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. For the pull-down assay, 200 μl of the clarified lysate was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of amylose resin (New England Biolabs) that had been pre-washed twice with Lysis buffer. MBP fusion protein bound resin was washed three times with Lysis buffer and the washed beads were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 100 ng of purified recombinant FEN-1. Resin was washed three times with binding buffer supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, and proteins were eluted by boiling with SDS Sample buffer and resolved on 8–16% gradient polyacrylamide Tris-glycine SDS gels. After transferring the proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, and probed with either anti-FEN-1 or anti-BLM antibodies as described above.ELISA for Detection of BLM-FEN-1 Protein-Protein Interaction— Purified recombinant BLM and WRN proteins were diluted to a concentration of 1 ng/μl in carbonate buffer (0.016 m Na2CO3, 0.034 m NaHCO3, pH 9.6), and were added to appropriate wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (50 μl/well), which was incubated at 4 °C. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used in the coating step for control reactions. The samples were aspirated, and the wells were blocked for 2 h at 30 °C with Blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 20 and 3% BSA). The procedure was repeated. FEN-1 was diluted to 1.0 ng/μl in Blocking buffer, and was added to the appropriate wells of the ELISA plate (50 μl/well), which was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. For ethidium bromide (EtBr) treatment, 50 μg/ml EtBr was included in the incubation with FEN-1 during the binding step in the corresponding wells. The samples were aspirated, and the wells were washed five times before addition of anti-FEN-1 antibody diluted 1:10,000 in Blocking buffer and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Following three washings, horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:10,000) was added to the wells, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. After washing five times, any WRN or BLM bound to the FEN-1 was detected using OPD substrate (Sigma). The reaction was terminated after 3 min with 3 n H2SO4, and absorbance readings were taken at 490 nm.ELISA Data Analysis—The fraction of the immobilized BLM or WRN bound to the microtiter well that was specifically bound by FEN-1 protein was determined from the ELISA. A Hill plot was used to analyze the data as described previously (26Brosh Jr., R.M. Li J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23500-23508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).Oligonucleotide Substrates—PAGE-purified oligonucleotides (Midland Certified Reagent Co.) used for preparation of DNA substrates were as described previously (33Brosh Jr., R.M. Driscoll H.C. Dianov G.L. Sommers J.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12204-12216Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, the appropriate oligonucleotide (10 pmol) was 5′-radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) using the manufacturer’s protocol. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a G25 Sephadex spin column (Amersham Biosciences). The radiolabeled oligonucleotide was annealed to the appropriate template oligonucleotide (25 pmol) by heating at 95 °C, and then cooling from 70 °C to 24 °C. If necessary, an upstream oligonucleotide (50 pmol) was then annealed to the duplex substrate by heating at 37 °C for 1 h and slowly cooling to 24 °C. Radiolabeled three-stranded DNA substrate molecules were verified for the presence of all three oligonucleotides by comparing the mobility of the labeled DNA substrate with the corresponding labeled control duplex and single-stranded oligonucleotides on native polyacrylamide gels. Three-stranded DNA substrate preparations were determined to be >98% homogeneous. The nicked duplex substrate was prepared using FLAP00, TSTEM25, and U25. The 1-nt flap substrate was prepared using FLAP01, TSTEM25, and U25. The 26-nt 5′-flap substrate was prepared using FLAP26, TSTEM25, and U25 (33Brosh Jr., R.M. Driscoll H.C. Dianov G.L. Sommers J.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12204-12216Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Annealed oligonucleotide substrates were used directly for the in vitro biochemical reactions.FEN-1 Incision Assays—Reactions (20 μl) contained 10 fmol of DNA substrate (except where indicated), and the specified amounts of BLM and/or FEN-1 in 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5% glycerol, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 8 mm MgCl2. BLM was mixed with the substrate and buffer on ice prior to the addition of FEN-1. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min (unless indicated otherwise), and were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of formamide stop solution (80% formamide (v/v), 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol), and then heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Products were resolved on 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gels. A PhosphorImager was used for detection and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) was used for quantification of the level of reaction products. Percent incision was calculated as described previously (34Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) from the equation: % incision = [P/(S + P)] × 100, where P is the sum of the intensity of the bands representing incision products, and S the intensity of the band representing the intact oligonucleotide. Background values from the no enzyme controls were subtracted out. Cleavage data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments with standard deviations shown by error bars.BLM Helicase Assays—Reactions (20 μl) contained 10 fmol of 26-nt 5′-flap DNA substrate, 2 mm ATP, and the indicated amounts of BLM in the same reaction buffer used for FEN-1 incision assays. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of Helicase Stop Solution (50 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol) containing 10-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide with the same sequence as the labeled strand. The products of the helicase reactions were resolved on nondenaturing 12% polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a Phosphorimager and quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The percent helicase substrate unwound was calculated as described previously (46Brosh Jr., R.M. Waheed J. Sommers J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23236-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using the following formula: % unwinding = 100 × (P/(S + P)], where P is the product and S is the substrate. The values of P and S have been corrected after subtracting background values in the no enzyme and heat-denatured substrate controls, respectively.RESULTSPhysical Int"
https://openalex.org/W1993569127,"In stratified epidermis, activation of the Hh/Gli signal transduction pathway has been implicated in the control of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. The zinc-finger transcription factor Gli2 has been identified as critical mediator of the Hh signal at the distal end of the pathway, but the molecular mechanisms by which Gli2 regulates cell proliferation or induces epidermal malignancies such as basal cell carcinoma are still unclear. Here, we provide evidence for a role of human GLI2 in antagonizing contact inhibition and epidermal differentiation. We show by gene expression profiling that activation of the GLI2 oncogene in human keratinocytes activates the transcription of a number of genes involved in cell cycle progression such as E2F1, CCND1, CDC2 and CDC45L, while it represses genes associated with epidermal differentiation. Analysis of the proliferative effect of GLI2 revealed that GLI2 is able to induce G1-S phase progression in contact-inhibited keratinocytes. Detailed time-course experiments identified E2F1 as early transcriptional target of GLI2. Further, we show that GLI2 expression in human keratinocytes results in a marked downregulation of epidermal differentiation markers. The data suggest a role for GLI2 in Hh-induced epidermal neoplasia by opposing epithelial cell cycle arrest signals and epidermal differentiation."

Here we report the crystallographic analysis of the GDP/GTP cycle of human Rab11a, and a structure-based mutagenesis study that identifies a novel mutant phenotype. The crystal structures show that the nucleotide-sensitive switch 1 and 2 regions differ from those of other Rab proteins. In Rab11-GDP, they contribute to a close packed symmetrical dimer, which may associate to membranes in the cell and allow Rab11 to undergo GDP/GTP cycles without recycling to the cytosol. The structure of active Rab11 delineates a three-dimensional site that includes switch 1 and is separate from the site defined by the Rab3/Rabphilin interface. It is proposed to form a novel interface for a Rab11 partner compatible with the simultaneous binding of another partner at the Rabphilin interface. Mutation of Ser29 to Phe in this epitope resulted in morphological modifications of the recycling compartment that are distinct from those induced by the classical dominant-negative and constitutively active Rab11 mutants. Recycling endosomes condensed in the perinuclear region where they retained recycling transferrin, and they clustered Rab11- and EEA1-positive membranes.

Rab proteins form a large family of small GTP-binding proteins with a wide range of functions in the coordination of vesiculo-tubular traffic (1Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar), which include directional tethering, docking and fusion of vesicles to target membranes (2Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), vesicle motility (3Hammer 3rd, J.A. Wu X.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and cargo recruitment (4Smythe E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 205-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This diversity of functions is essential for determining transport specificity and organelles identity, and is accounted for by the multitude of Rab proteins (at least 60 members in humans) (5Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). With an average sequence identity little above 30%, they form a heterogeneous family that can be classified into subfamilies based on both functional and sequence relationships (5Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 6Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The cellular functions of Rab proteins are implemented by their ability to couple a structural GDP/GTP switch, common to all small GTP-binding of the Ras superfamily, to a membrane/cytosol switch that depends on lipid modifications attached to their C terminus (7Pereira-Leal J.B. Hume A.N. Seabra M.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the simplest scheme, GDP-bound Rab proteins are maintained in the cytosol by RabGDIs, 1The abbreviations used are: GDI, guanine dissociation inhibitor; Tf, transferrin; TfR, transferrin receptor; Rab11wt, wild type human Rab11a; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); GppNHp, guanyl-5′-imidodiphosphate. which deliver them to donor membranes where they are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors. GTP-bound Rabs then bind to effectors until they are turned off by GTPase activating proteins and recycled back to the cytosol by RabGDIs. This basic model, in which all events happen in sequence, is increasingly challenged by recent studies. For instance, it has been shown that guanine nucleotide exchange factors and effectors can be associated in complexes (8Horiuchi H. Lippe R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V.

Cell. 2001; 12: 2219-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), or that GDP/GTP cycles can occur without recycling to the cytosol (11Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I.

Physiol. 1998; 275: C163-C170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rab proteins also appear to be multifunctional and have multiple effectors often unrelated to each other (1Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar, 13Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In apparent contradiction to this diversity, other partners display promiscuity to various Rab proteins, such as Rab Escort Proteins (14Pereira-Leal J.B. Strom M. Godfrey R.F. Seabra M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), RabGDI (15Chen W. Feng Y. Chen D. Wandinger-Ness A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3241-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), or the MSS4 regulator (16Burton J.L. Burns M.E. Gatti E. Augustine G.J. De Camilli P.

This complex implementation addresses the issue of how Rab proteins utilize their cycle to fulfill their cellular functions. This applies in particular to the Rab11 protein whose structural and mutational analysis is reported here. This subfamily comprises the ubiquitous Rab11a and Rab11b and the closely related epithelial Rab25 proteins. The best characterized function of Rab11 is the control of TfR recycling and its routing at the exit from recycling endosomes in the pericentriolar region (18Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 19Ren M. Xu G. Zeng J. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The classical mutations of small GTP-binding proteins that affect their nucleotide binding and GTPase properties have been extensively used to investigate these functions. In non-polarized cells, overexpression of the dominant-negative Rab11(S25N) mutant redistributes TfR in thin tubular structures that concentrate in a perinuclear network, whereas wild type Rab11 and the constitutively active Rab11(Q70L) mutant induce the formation of tubulo-vesicular TfR-positive organelles at the cell periphery (20Wilcke M.

Rab11 also regulates a set of related endosomal functions such as the mobilization of endosomal membranes for phagocytosis in macrophages (22Cox D. Lee D.J. Dale B.M. Calafat J. Greenberg S. Proc.

Structural and mutagenesis studies provide a means to gain insight into the unique structure-function relationships of Rab proteins. Recent structural studies of the GDP/GTP cycle of Rab proteins have shown that, despite their non-conventional cellular cycle, they do not depart from other small GTP-binding proteins and respond to the alternation of GDP and GTP by conformational changes and disorder-to-order transitions at the so-called switch 1 and switch 2 regions (28Stroupe C.

These latter regions have been termed RabSF1–4 and include the N terminus/β1, α1/switch 1, α3–β5, and α5/C terminus, respectively (6Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Yet, the implementation of the dual nucleotide/membrane cycle of Rab proteins, and how this cycle is distributed over various effectors, remain open questions. In this study, we report the high resolution crystal structures of inactive GDP-bound and active GTPγS-bound human Rab11a. These structures yield a novel hypothesis as to the coupling between the GDP/GTP and membrane/cytosol cycles, which would involve a membrane-bound Rab11-GDP dimer, and they delineate a novel site of interaction for Rab11 partners. This site was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and the resulting mutants were assayed for the distribution of endosomal markers and endosomal transferrin recycling. This analysis revealed a novel phenotype distinct from that of previously characterized Rab11 mutants, which provides insights into the recognition of Rab11 by distinct effectors. cDNA Cloning and Protein Expression—Because initial trials to crystallize full-length human Rab11a failed, a truncated form (residues 1 to 173) lacking the hypervariable 43 C-terminal residues was used throughout the crystallographic study (referred to as Rab11 hereafter). In addition, a mutation impairing the spontaneous GTPase, Q70L, was introduced to grow crystals of the active form. Constructs of Rab11 and the Q70L mutant were generated by PCR using previously described pGEM-Rab11 constructs (20Wilcke M. Johannes L. Galli T. Mayau V. Goud B. Salamero J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1207-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) as templates and the following oligonucleotides: R11-forward (5′-CGCGGATCCTTATATGTTCTGACAGCA-3′) and R11DeltaTyr173 (5′-TTTCTGCAGTCAGTATATCTCTGTCAGAAT-3′). The PCR products were then cloned as BamHI/PstI inserts in pQE32 vector (Qiagen). His-tagged Rab11 proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified by nickel affinity and stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Full-length Ser29 → Phe (S29F), Ala49 → Lys (A49K), and Arg33 → Asp (R33D) Rab11 mutants fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were obtained with the QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions using pEGFP-Rab11wt (generous gift of Dr. L. Gordon) as a template and the following oligonucleotides: S29F-forward (5′-AGTAATCTCTTGTTTCGATTTACTCGA-3′), S29F-reverse (5′-TCGAGTAAATCGAAACAAGAGATTACT-3′), A49K-forward (5′-GGAGTAGAGTTTAAAACAAGAAGCATC-3′), A49K-reverse (5′-GATGCTTCTTGTTTTAAACTCTACTCC-3′), R33D-forward (5′-TCTCGATTTACTGATAATGAGTTTAAT-3′), and R33D-reverse (5′-ATTAAACTCATTATCAGTAAATCGAGA-3′). Protein Crystallization—All crystallizations were performed at 20 °C by the vapor diffusion method. Crystals of Rab11-GDP (10 mg/ml) appeared within a few days in 1.6–1.8 m (NH4)2SO4, 3–6% PEG 400, 3–10% 1,3-butanediol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8–8.5, and were optimized by microseeding. Prior to flash-freezing in liquid ethane, crystals were rapidly soaked in a stabilizing solution containing 33% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Because no Mg2+ could be located in the electron density map under these conditions, further crystallizations were done with 8 mm MgCl2 in the crystallization solution. Crystals of Rab11(Q70L)-GTPγS (10 mg/ml) were grown in the presence of 5 mm GTPγS. Nucleotide exchange was allowed to proceed spontaneously at high Mg2+ concentration, because EDTA rapidly precipitated the protein. Crystals appeared within 5–10 days in 1.1–1.5 m NaCl, 150–200 mm NaH2PO4, 150–200 mm KH2PO4, 100 mm Na-MES, pH 6.5, and were stabilized in the reservoir solution supplied with 22% xylitol prior to flash-freezing. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Analysis—All diffraction data sets were collected at 100 K at beamline ID14 at the ESRF synchrotron in Grenoble. Data were processed with DENZO/SCALEPACK (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Phases were obtained by molecular replacement with AMoRe (37Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Refinements were performed with CNS (38Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T.

The asymmetric unit comprises two Rab11-GDP molecules related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis. Refined Rab11-GDP was then used as a search model for Rab11(Q70L)-GTPγS. The refined structures of Rab11-GDP and Rab11-GTPγS have no Ramachandran outliers. Crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table I.

A cutoff distance of 0.5 Å for including Cα pairs in the refinement of the superposition matrix was found to robustly superimpose conserved secondary structures without artifactually averaging significant structural differences. Figures were generated with Molscript (39Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallog. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and rendered with Raster3D (40Merrit E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunocytochemistry—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as previously described (20Wilcke M. Johannes L. Galli T. Mayau V. Goud B. Salamero J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1207-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation and expression of GFP constructs was allowed for 24 h. For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. After permeabilization markers were visualized by double labeling with primary antibodies followed by incubation with Cy3- and Cy5-conjugated anti-IgG (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst AG). Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using a SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). Confocal sections or slice projections were further processed using Adobe Photoshop. The following antibodies were used: sheep anti-TGN46 antibody (Serotec), goat anti-EEA1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-human TfR mouse antibody DF1513 (Sigma), fluorescein isothiocyanate, Cy3 and Cy5 donkey secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, and glutamine were from Invitrogen. Human transferrin-Alexa 633 was from Molecular Probes. The antibody against Rab11 was purified from a rabbit antiserum raised against full-length recombinant Rab11 as described (20Wilcke M. Johannes L. Galli T. Mayau V. Goud B. Salamero J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1207-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Transferrin Internalization and Recycling—For steady state internalization of transferrin, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with Alexa 633-labeled Tf to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml in internalization medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), then rinsed twice with ice-cold internalization medium before fixation in paraformaldehyde. For Tf chase experiments, cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled Tf as above, rinsed twice with ice-cold internalization medium, and incubated at 37 °C in normal serum containing medium. At the requested time points, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde and mounted before image acquisition. For the biochemical analysis of 125I-Tf recycling, confluent transfected cells were cultured for 1 h in the absence of fetal calf serum. Cells were then loaded with iron (Fe3+)-saturated human 125I-Tf (200 ng/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and then incubated in fresh medium for the indicated times as previously described (41Mohrmann K. Gerez L. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32029-32035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Media were harvested at each time point to assess recycling. Intracellular radioactivity was also determined. 125I-Tf in media and cells was established in a γ-counter. The rate of Rab11 mutants expression was assessed in parallel by fluorescence microscopy and experiments were performed when the expression efficiency reached more than 60% of the cell population. The Structures of Inactive and Active Rab11 Depart from Those of Other Rab Proteins—The GDP/GTP structural cycle of human Rab11a is reported here, including inactive Rab11-GDP at 2Å resolution and active Rab11-GTPγS-Mg2+ at 2.3Å resolution (Table I, Fig. 1). In both crystals forms, Rab11 has the overall fold common to other small GTP-binding proteins including Rab proteins, with a conserved protein core and nucleotide-sensitive switch 1 and switch 2 regions (Fig. 1). The switch regions have well defined conformations in both the inactive and active forms, and undergo large conformational changes that span residues Glu39 to Val46 (switch 1) and Ala68 to Ala79 (switch 2). Other conformational changes are located at the interswitch β-turn (residues Ile53 to Ile60) and reflect its flexibility. The unusually ordered conformation of the switch regions in Rab11-GDP is stabilized in a large symmetrical dimeric interface (Fig. 1A). The buried surface area is ∼2000 Å2, which is larger than average nonspecific interactions between crystal neighbors (42Janin J. Rodier F. Proteins. 1995; 23: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) but in the range (1600 ± 400 Å2) of biologically relevant protein-protein complexes (43Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). 75% of the buried area is contributed by switch 1 and 2 regions, which are therefore essentially inaccessible to protein-protein interactions in the dimer. Rab11-GDP lacks a bound Mg2+ ion at the nucleotide binding site, despite the high Mg2+ concentration in the crystallization conditions (Fig. 1B). The deficiency of stabilizing interactions resulting from the absence of the Mg2+ ion is made up by alternative interactions that maintain the nucleotide tightly bound, including hydrogen bonds of switch 1 with the α-phosphate and the ribose of GDP, and an alternative interaction of the invariant Mg2+-binding Ser from the P-loop (Ser25) with its α-phosphate (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the invariant switch 1 Thr (Thr43 in Rab11a) that binds Mg2+ and the γ-phosphate of GTP in active Rab11, exchanges a symmetrical hydrogen bond with Glu47 in strand β2 from the symmetrical Rab11 molecule (Fig. 1A). This interaction is strikingly reminiscent of the interaction of the equivalent Thr in small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family with an aspartate from RhoGDI, which has been proposed to account for the inhibition of guanine nucleotide dissociation by RhoGDI (44Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In contrast, the GTPγS-bound form of Rab11 is monomeric in the crystal. The interactions of the guanine triphosphate nucleotide are similar to those found in other structures of Rab active forms, except that neither Ser20 from the P-loop nor Ser42 from switch 1 interact with the most external γ-phosphate oxygen, which remains accessible to the solvent (Fig. 1C). Switch 2 of Rab11 is the region that diverges most from other GTP-bound Rabs, as it is not helical and it makes less interactions with switch 1 (Fig. 1D). Although an influence of crystal packing cannot be excluded, this unique conformation confirms the trend of Rab proteins in having structurally heterogeneous switch 2 regions in their active forms. The situation is more subtle at the switch 1 region, whose conformation in Rab11-GTP is closest to that in Rab3 and Sec4 despite their sequence divergence (Fig. 1D). Comparison of all structures of GTP-bound Rab proteins shows that switch 1 regions fall in two structural classes, which depend on the main chain conformation of a residue located at the beginning of switch 1 (Ser40 in Rab11) (Fig. 2). This residue either points toward the nucleotide as in Rab11 (Fig. 2A) or is flipped by 180° (Fig. 2B), possibly as the result of a steric conflict with the facing residue from the P-loop (Ser20 in Rab11) for binding the γ-phosphate (Fig. 2, B and C). The alternative conformations of switch 1 determine the shape of a three-dimensional site spanning residues 26–49 in Rab11, which combines switch 1 with an upstream subfamily specific region (α1 and α1-switch 1 loop) and a downstream Rab family motif (switch 1-β2 loop) (Fig. 2). This combination of nucleotide-dependent and Rab subfamily-specific characteristics suggested that this region may define a novel three-dimensional epitope for the interaction of Rab11 with specific partners. To test this hypothesis, Rab11 family-specific residues at the surface of this epitope were changed into their counterparts in Rab3a and tested for their effects on the distribution of early endosomal markers and transferrin transport. The S29F Mutation Unbalances the Distribution of Early Endosomal Markers in HeLa Cells—Residues Ser29 in α1, Arg33 in the α1/switch 1 loop, and Ala49 in the switch 1/β2 loop (Fig. 2A) were mutated to Phe, Asp, and Lys, respectively. The mutants were fused to GFP to examine their cellular localization compared with wild type Rab11 and its classical mutants, and to markers of the endocytic pathway. All mutants strongly labeled membrane structures (Fig. 3, B, C, and F), as also observed for wild type Rab11 (Fig. 3D) or the Q70L mutant (Fig. 3E), but contrasting with the predominantly cytosolic staining of Rab11(S25N) (Fig. 3"

An Escherichia coli mutant lacking the major membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (NB-prone) requires divalent cations for viability and cell integrity and is impaired in several membrane functions that are corrected by introduction of the “foreign” NB-prone neutral glycolipid α-monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MGlcDAG) synthesized by the MGlcDAG synthase from Acholeplasma laidlawii. Dependence on Mg2+ was reduced, and cellular yields and division malfunction were greatly improved. The increased passive membrane permeability of the mutant was not abolished, but protein-mediated osmotic stress adaptation to salts and sucrose was recovered by the presence of MGlcDAG. MGlcDAG also restored tryptophan prototrophy and active transport function of lactose permease, both critically dependent on phosphatidylethanolamine. Three mechanisms can explain the observed effects: NB-prone MGlcDAG improves the quenched lateral pressure profile across the bilayer; neutral MGlcDAG dilutes the high anionic lipid surface charge; MGlcDAG provides a neutral lipid that can hydrogen bond and/or partially ionize. The reduced dependence on Mg2+ and lack of correction by high monovalent salts strongly support the essential nature of the NB properties of MGlcDAG.

The lipid bilayer of biological membranes acts as a permeability barrier permitting maintenance of essential ion gradients and is also the local environment for integral and peripheral membrane proteins. Important bilayer structural features are a liquid-crystalline state, an optimal length of the lipid chains, and critical fractions of anionic and nonbilayer- (NB) 1The abbreviations used are: NB, nonbilayer; alMGS, A. laidlawii 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase; CL, cardiolipin; FCCP, carbonyl cyanine p-trifluoromethoxylphenylhydrazone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LacY, lactose permease; MGlcDAG, α-monoglucosyldiacylglycerol; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; TMG, methyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. prone lipids. Because of their small head groups the NB-prone lipids, when embedded in a bilayer, cause a curvature elastic stress of each monolayer with closer acyl chain packing (i.e. higher chain order) that changes the lateral pressure profile across the membrane (1Cantor R.S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 101: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Increasing the proportion of NB-prone lipids leads to a lower temperature for the bilayer to NB phase transition, which in many cases is fairly close to the growth temperature of organisms (2Lindblom G. Brentel I. Sjolund M. Wikander G. Wieslander A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7502-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 3Morein S. Andersson A. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6801-6809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The balance of bilayer to NB-prone lipids may affect the passive membrane permeability of the bilayer (e.g. (4Noordam P.C. van Echteld C.J. de Kruijff B. Verkleij A.J. de Gier J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1980; 27: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)), the folding and assembly of membrane proteins (5Booth P.J. Templer R.H. Meijberg W. Allen S.J. Curran A.R. Lorch M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 36: 501-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the function of important cellular processes such as cell division, transport, and osmotic responses. The essential character of such NB-prone lipids for cell membrane functions has been little studied. NB-prone lipids substantially affect the activity of several different types of proteins when studied in vitro. For example, a critical conformational change of transmembrane rhodopsin (6Botelho A.V. Gibson N.J. Thurmond R.L. Wang Y. Brown M.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6354-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and the activity of the interface-bound CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (7Attard G.S. Templer R.H. Smith W.S. Hunt A.N. Jackowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9032-9036Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) are modulated by variations in NB-prone lipids and membrane curvature elastic stress, respectively. Likewise, membrane binding of the catalytical domain of Escherichia coli leader peptidase was much higher with NB-prone lipids present (8van den Brink-van der Laan E. Dalbey R.E. Demel R.A. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9677-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). NB-prone lipids stimulate the in vitro activity of the reconstituted integral bacterial protein translocase (9van der Does C. Swaving J. van Klompenburg W. Driessen A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2472-2478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). On the other hand, anionic lipids affect several functions, such as the bilayer surface binding of many amphitropic proteins including DnaA (10Crooke E. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), MinD (11Mileykovskaya E. Fishov I. Fu X. Corbin B.D. Margolin W. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22193-22198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (12Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and the correct translocation and assembly of various membrane proteins (13van Klompenburg W. de Kruijff B. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Specific lipid-protein interactions have also been shown to be significant in the three-dimensional structures of transmembrane proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin from Halobacterium salinarum (14Belrhali H. Nollert P. Royant A. Menzel C. Rosenbusch J.P. Landau E.M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Struc. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 909-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and the potassium channel KscA from Streptomyces lividans (15Doyle D.A. Morais-Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5769) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE; zwitterionic) is the major NB-prone lipid in E. coli and accounts for ∼75% of the total phospholipid content of the inner membrane and a slightly higher amount in the inner leaflet of the outer membrane; the remaining major phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), are anionic (16Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PE in vivo, an E. coli mutant was constructed lacking phosphatidylserine synthase, which catalyzes the committed step to the synthesis of PE (17DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 26610710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Growth and survival of this mutant are dependent on the presence of a subset of extracellular divalent cations at millimolar concentrations. Only those divalent cations that supported growth of the mutant also restored the temperature-dependent bilayer/NB phase transition profile of the extracted lipids to that of lipids from wild type cells in the absence of divalent cations (18Rietveld A.G. Killian J.A. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12427-12433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Restoration of the normal phase behavior was caused specifically by the interaction of cations with CL, which is a major lipid in the mutant (19Killian J.A. Koorengevel M.C. Bouwstra J.A. Gooris G. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells lacking both PE and CL are not viable (17DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 26610710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this compensatory mechanism is less likely to work for processes dependent on the chemical rather than the physical properties of PE. Cell division is strongly defective in the mutant lacking PE, resulting in very long cell filaments even with divalent cations present, probably partly because of misassembly or mislocalization of the FtsZ-dependent division machinery (20Mileykovskaya E. Sun Q. Margolin W. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4252-4257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and components of the Min system (11Mileykovskaya E. Fishov I. Fu X. Corbin B.D. Margolin W. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22193-22198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an alteration in the mutant cell envelope structure or physical properties also results in a direct activation of the Cpx stress response pathway (21Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Another striking feature of the mutant is a misfolding of the integral membrane transport proteins lactose permease (LacY) and phenylalanine permease; the first six or first two transmembrane helices are inserted in an inverted orientation in the membrane in the former (22Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) or latter protein (23Zhang W. Bogdanov M. Jing P. Pittard A.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50128-50135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), respectively. These and other studies of the mutant indicate a strong dependence on PE for a number of membrane-associated functions. In addition to PE, monoglycosyldiacylglycerols are major NB-prone membrane lipids present in most photosynthetic membranes and many Gram-positive bacteria. To determine whether the affected functions in the E. coli lipid mutant are dependent on the chemical structure of PE or on its NB character we have expressed the gene for the α-monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MGlcDAG) synthase (a glucosyltransferase) from the mycoplasma Acholeplasma laidlawii (24Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in E. coli cells lacking PE. MGlcDAG is an uncharged and major NB-prone lipid that is crucial for bilayer packing properties in the A. laidlawii (25Yue A.W. Wong B.C. Rieder J. Lewis R.N. Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) membrane, varying in amounts from 5 to 50 mol % depending on growth conditions (26Wieslander A. Nordstrom S. Dahlqvist A. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This new E. coli lipid mutant contains up to 55% of the “foreign lipid” MGl-cDAG. The MGlcDAG-containing PE-lacking strain grows faster, is less dependent on divalent cations, and exhibits partially restored cell division and active sugar transport by LacY. The MGlcDAG strain also compensates for osmotic stress better, and membrane permeability properties are changed but not restored. Construction of E. coli Lipid Mutants—Plasmid pET-MGlcDAG (24Berg S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) carries a DNA fragment encoding the A. laidlawii membrane-associated 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase (alMGS) (EC 2.4.1.157). The N-terminal methionine of alMGS was fused to a fragment encoding a new initiation codon followed by information encoding 6 histidines, a thrombin protease site, a factor Xa protease site, and 3 additional amino acids derived from the vector. This chimeric gene was excised using NcoI and BamHI (5′ to 3′) and ligated into plasmid pTEF1/Zeo (Invitrogen) using the same restriction sites. The alMGS gene completely replaced the vector zeocin resistance gene and was positioned directly 3′ of the artificial prokaryotic constitutive EM7 promoter. The following sequence precedes the N-terminal Met of alMGS: MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMLEEIEGR. This plasmid, pTMG3, also carries the β-lactamase gene. Strain AD93/pDD72 (pss93::kanR/pssA+ camR pSC101 temperature-sensitive replicon) (17DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 26610710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with pTMG3 selecting for ApR to generate AD93/pDD72/pTMG3 (MGlcDAG- and PE-containing). Strain AD93/pTMG3 (MGlcDAG-containing and PE-lacking) was generated by curing pDD72 by growth at 42 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, supplemented with 50 mm MgCl2, for 4 h prior to plating to LB agar plates (with 50 mm MgCl2), and incubating for 2 days at 42 °C (17DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 26610710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Colonies unable to synthesize PE were identified by screening for the lack of growth in the absence of 50 mm MgCl2 followed by lipid analysis. Growth Conditions—Unless otherwise stated all E. coli strains were grown under the same conditions before as during experiments, and all strains compared in a given experiment were grown under the same conditions. Unless otherwise stated bacteria were grown in LB broth containing 5 g/liter NaCl with 10 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C. Plasmids expressing alMGS were maintained by supplementing growth medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Osmotic Stress and Solvent Exposure Experiments—After growing cells overnight in LB containing 5 g/liter NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2, 15-ml glass tubes were prepared with different concentrations of salts, sugars, and organic solvents in LB containing 5 g/liter NaCl with 10 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 5 ml. The cells were grown for 24 h at 30 °C with 150 strokes/min in a water bath shaker. Absorbance at 600 nm was measured at the start and after growth with the additives. All osmotic response experiments were done at least in duplicate. Growth with Sterols—Stock solutions in ethanol (10 mg/ml) were made for cholesterol, 5-cholestene-3-one and 4-cholestene-3-one. These were diluted to the indicated concentration in sterile LB containing 4 g/liter bovine serum albumin as sterol carrier and stirred for 2 h. Cells were grown with 0, 30, and 100 μm sterols under the same conditions as in the osmotic stress and solvent experiments. Lipid Analysis—To incorporate radiolabel metabolically into the fatty acyl chains of the lipids, overnight cell cultures were inoculated into LB medium with different additives (e.g. salts or solvents) containing 0.2 μCi/ml [14C]acetic acid. After 24 h cells were harvested by centrifugation, and lipids were extracted from cell pellets by extensive stirring in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) followed by centrifugation and a second extraction in methanol. The lipids were concentrated by evaporation, separated on Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (Merck) in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v/v), and visualized and quantified by electronic autoradiography (Packard Instant Imager™). Lipids were identified by mobilities relative to known standard lipids. MGlcDAG was further identified by a positive color reaction with orcinol (27Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research.3rd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1986: 456Google Scholar). Separation of Outer and Inner Membranes—Spheroplasts and membranes were prepared from cells harvested in mid-exponential phase. These were suspended in 10 mm potassium PIPES, pH 7.0, 0.75 m sucrose, 10 mm MgSO4, 2.5% (w/v) LiCl, and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After the addition of 2 mg/ml lysozyme, cells were gently shaken at 37 °C for 60 min for AD93 or 90 min for AD93/pTMG3 and AD93/pDD72. The formation of spheroplasts was followed by light microscopy. Intact spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × gav for 10 min at room temperature and resuspended at 10 mg of total protein/ml in the above buffer without LiCl (modified from Ref. 28van Veen H.W. Abee T. Kortstee G.J. Konings W.N. Zehnder A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19377-19383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were broken by ultrasonication for 3 × 15 s on ice. Removal of whole spheroplasts was accomplished by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, and the total membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 60 min. Membranes were resuspended in 1 ml of 25% (w/v) sucrose and layered on top of a sucrose gradient made from 0.5 ml of 55% (bottom) and 2.1 ml each of 50, 45, 40, 35, and 30% sucrose in 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.01 m EDTA, and centrifuged in a Beckman SW-41 rotor for 5 h. Outer membranes were collected from the top of the 50% step, and the inner membrane fraction was collected from the top of the 40 and 35% steps of the gradient. Inner membrane fractions revealed a typical reddish brown color, whereas the outer membrane fractions were clear yellow (cf. (29Sprott G.D. Koval S. Schnaitman C. Gerhardt P. Murray R.G.E. Willis W.A. Krieg N.R. Methods for General and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D.C.1984: 72-103Google Scholar)). This separation was also verified by the protein patterns displayed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Lipids were analyzed as above. Light Microscopy—E. coli cell length distribution was viewed with an Olympus BX60 microscope. Images were captured with an Optronics DEI-750 video camera and edited by Adobe Photoshop 4.0. Membranes were stained by adding 1 μm FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) to overnight cultures and stirred for 3 h at 30 °C before washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Potential formation of intracellular membranes by alMGS in AD93/pTMG3 was compared with alMGS expressed from a T7 promoter in vector pET15b carried in E. coli BL21(DE3) (cf. (30Li L. Storm P. Karlsson O.P. Berg S. Wieslander A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9677-9686Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)). On the microscope slides the cells were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 0.7% low melting agarose. Cells were viewed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 (rhodamine filter) fluorescence microscope. Images were captured with a CCD camera (Sony), and Image Access 3.0 software (Imagic Bildverarbeitung AG). Editing of images was made in Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Localization of alMGS-GFP—Full size (398 amino acids) alMGS was cloned upstream and in-frame with the gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) using a PCR primer approach based on the sequence of the alMGS DNA (24Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and the vector pGFPuv (Clontech) (cf. (31Edman M. Berg S. Storm P. Wikström M. Vikström S. Ohman A. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8420-8428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)). Ligation, transformation of E. coli JM109 (wild type for phospholipid composition), and selection followed standard procedures. The resulting construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Enzymatic activity of the alMGS-GFP was analyzed after induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside by labeling of E. coli lipids in vivo with radioactive acetate (24Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and by assay for MGlcDAG synthesis activity after detergent solubilization (24Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding alMGS-GFP was transformed into AD93/pDD72 by standard techniques. Localization of alMGS-GFP in E. coli strains was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with fluorescein isothiocyanate filters. Deconvoluted images of cells were obtained with a Delta Vision wild field optical sectioning microscope (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) equipped with a ×100 oil-immersion objective and visualized with a cooled charge-coupled device camera and fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set; z axis optical sections were taken at 0.1-μm intervals. Deconvolution of raw data was performed with five rounds of integration. Membrane Permeability—Leakiness and permeability of cell membranes were assayed by antibiotic sensitivity and by RNase release from the periplasmic space. For antibiotic sensitivity experiments PDM antibiotic sensitivity discs (AB Biodisc, Sweden) were used. All discs contained 30 μg of antibiotic except for rifampicin, which was at 50 μg. Cells were spread evenly on LB plates before the discs were positioned. Plates were incubated for 24 h before measurements of the size of growth inhibition around the discs. Experiments were made in triplicate. Leakiness of the outer membrane for larger molecules was estimated by release of periplasmic RNase. Colonies of AD93/pDD72, AD93, and AD93/pTMG3 were replica plated onto LB agar plates with 50 mm MgCl2. The plates were overlaid with soft agar containing 1.5% RNA (adjusted to pH 7), incubated at 42 °C to permit digestion of RNA, and then flooded with 0.1 n HCl to precipitate undigested RNA. Colonies leaking periplasmic RNase were detected by a light halo. Assay for LacY Function—A gene encoding a cysteinless derivative of LacY carrying a F250C replacement was amplified from plasmid pT7-5/C-less lacY/F250C (32Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), herein referred to as pT7-5LacY, by PCR primers 5′-ATTTGCGGCCGCGCTTATCGAAATTAATACGACTC-3′ and 5′-GGAAGATCTAAGCGACTTCATTCACCTGACG-3′ containing a BglII and NotI site, respectively. The gene was positioned between the BglII and NotI sites of plasmid pTMG3. This plasmid (pTMG-LacY) was introduced into PE-containing E. coli strain AL95/pDD72GM (pss93::kanR lacY::Tn9/pssA+ genR pSC101 temperature-sensitive replicon) (22Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Plasmid pDD72GM was cured (PE-lacking) as described above. LacY transport function was measured by the uptake of radiolabeled methyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (TMG) by whole cells grown to mid-log phase in LB containing 50 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described previously (33Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 732-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Active transport function was verified by inhibition of uptake by the addition of 50 μm carbonyl cyanine p-trifluoromethoxylphenylhydrazone (FCCP); Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody specific for LacY (H. R. Kaback, University of California, Los Angeles) was used to normalize activity and content between strains. Levels of a Foreign Lipid in E. coli—Strain AD93 lacks the major phospholipid PE because of inactivation of the gene (pssA) encoding phosphatidylserine synthase (17DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 26610710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and requires divalent cations such as Mg2+ in the growth medium for optimal growth and viability. The lack of PE is compensated by an increase in PG and CL to maintain a normal protein:phospholipid ratio. E. coli contains only trace amounts (less than 1%) of neutral uncharged lipids such as diacylglycerol (34Weissborn A.C. Rumley M.K. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4856-4859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is derived from PG and PE during synthesis of membrane-derived oligosaccharides localized to the periplasmic space (35Kennedy E.P. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Vol. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1064-1071Google Scholar). This rapidly metabolized pool of diacylglycerol (plus UDP-glucose) is sufficient to make significant amounts of MGlcDAG after introduction of plasmids encoding alMGS (24Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The presence of plasmid-borne copies of the pssA gene in AD93 results in wild type PE levels, phospholipid composition, and phenotype (17DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 26610710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane lipids were labeled with [14C]acetic acid during growth, and analyses revealed substantial differences dependent on the plasmid-borne lipid-synthesizing genes present (Fig. 1, A and B). AD93 (denoted as PE-) and AD93/pDD72 (denoted as PE+) showed the expected mutant and wild type lipid compositions, respectively (17DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 26610710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); all cells were analyzed after growth into stationary phase (36Hiraoka S. Matsuzaki H. Shibuya I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). AD93/pTMG3 (denoted as PE-/MGlcDAG+) contained up to 55 mol % MGlcDAG depending on growth conditions (see below). AD93/pDD72/pTMG3 (PE+/MGlcDAG+) contained only a maximum of 10 mol % of MGl-cDAG and a corresponding reduction of the PE amount (data not shown), analogous to previous data (24Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Separation and isolation of inner and outer membranes of AD93, AD93/pDD72, and AD93/pTMG3 showed fractions of the lipids in both membranes corresponding to those in Fig. 1B, indicating that MGl-cDAG could be transported to the outer membrane (data not shown). MGlcDAG was also substantially more resistant than the phospholipids to endogenous lipolytic degradation during prolonged incubation of the membrane fractions. MGlcDAG-containing Strain Is Less Dependent on Mg2+— The presence of divalent cations such as Mg2+ is essential for the growth and viability of AD93 (17DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 26610710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the wild type phase transition (bilayer/nonbilayer) properties of lipids extracted from AD93 (18Rietveld A.G. Killian J.A. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12427-12433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of the strains with different concentrations of MgCl2 showed that the PE-/MGlcDAG+ strain is less dependent on MgCl2 compared with the PE- strain (Fig. 2). Both strains grew faster with increasing Mg2+, but in general PE-/MGlcDAG+ cells grew faster and reached higher culture densities at stationary phase than PE- cells. Neither strain grew as well as PE+ cells, which have about a 20-min doubling time and reach an A600 of 2–3 in the stationary phase (not shown). When grown with 5 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 2 inset, note linear scale for A600), PE- cells lysed as they approached late log or stationary phase, whereas PE-/MGlcDAG+ cells were stable. MGlcDAG amounts were at 50–55 mol % at 10 mm MgCl2 and decreased to 20–30 mol % at 50 mm MgCl2 with little variability at different stages of growth (data not shown). The purified MGlcDAG synthase is stimulated by Mg2+, but at the same time increasing ion concentrations may screen the anionic lipid charge also essential for enzyme activity (37Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikström S. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For the following experiments 10 mm MgCl2 supplementation was chosen, yielding maximum amounts of MGlcDAG. Cell Division and Cell Morphology—Despite the presence of Mg2+ and the associated compensation of lipid packing properties (18Rietveld A.G. Killian J.A. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12427-12433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), strain AD93 cannot divide properly. Long, multinucleoid filaments are formed, probably because of misassembly of cell division proteins in the absence of PE resulting in failure of cells to constrict (20Mileykovskaya E. Sun Q. Margolin W. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4252-4257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the presence of MGlcDAG partially suppressed this morphological phenotype of PE-lacking cells.

The assembly pathway is unknown. Pulse-labeling studies show that when KIR6.2 is expressed individually, its turnover is biphasic; ∼60% is lost with t½ ∼36 min. The remainder converts to a long-lived species (t½ ∼26 h) with an estimated half-time of 1.2 h. Expressed alone, SUR1 has a long half-life, ∼25.5 h. When KIR6.2 and SUR1 are co-expressed, they associate rapidly and the fast degradation of KIR6.2 is eliminated. Based on changes in the glycosylation state of SUR1, the half-time for the maturation of KATP channels, including completion of assembly, transit to the Golgi, and glycosylation, is ∼2.2 h. Estimation of the turnover rates of mature, fully glycosylated SUR1 associated with KIR6.2 and of KIR6.2 associated with Myc-tagged SUR1 gave similar values for the half-life of KATP channels, a mean value of ∼7.3 h. KATP channel subunits in INS-1 β-cells displayed qualitatively similar kinetics. The results imply the octameric channels are stable. Two mutations, KIR6.2 W91R and SUR1 ΔF1388, identified in patients with the severe form of familial hyperinsulinism, profoundly alter the rate of KIR6.2 and SUR1 turnover, respectively. Both mutant subunits associate with their respective partners but dissociate freely and degrade rapidly. The data support models of channel formation in which KIR6.2-SUR1 heteromers assemble functional channels and are inconsistent with models where SUR1 can only assemble with KIR6.2 tetramers.

Liu Y. Moremen K.W. Sifers R.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, dibasic ER retention motifs, specifically an -RKR- motif, have been identified in both KIR and SUR subunits. Their removal or mutation results in loss of the requirement of the partner subunit for correct trafficking (3Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Hauri H.P. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R391-R393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Binding with COP1 complexes can be antagonized by 14–3-3 isoforms to facilitate ER exit, and the interaction between dimeric 14–3-3 and the -RKR- motif in KIR6.2 has been reported to be enhanced by assembly of KIR subunits (14Yuan H. Michelsen K. Schwappach B. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 638-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Reduced or loss-of-function mutations in KIR6.2 and SUR1 are known to account for ∼50% of the mild and severe cases of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (16Glaser B. Semin.

One general suggestion has been that retention in the ER provides additional time for completion of channel assembly. KIR6.2 subunits lacking the -RKR- motif can assemble channels in the absence of a SUR, and these will reach the surface indicating SUR is not obligatory for assembly of the channel pore. The assembly pathway is unknown, and at what stage SUR interacts with KIR is a matter of conjecture. Similarly, the lifetimes of the individual subunits, of mutant subunits, and of the channel complex have not been reported. We have used 35S[Met/Cys] pulse-labeling methods to determine the lifetimes of SUR1 and KIR6.2 alone, to examine the effect of two severe hyperinsulinemic mutations on subunit lifetime, and to follow the maturation of channels by monitoring changes in the glycosylation state of SUR1. The results show that when SUR1 is expressed in the absence of the inward rectifier it is long-lived in contrast, for example, to CFTR, which has a half-life of ∼30 min in the ER (26Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 27Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When KIR6.2 is expressed in the absence of SUR1, a fraction (∼60%) degrades rapidly, but the remainder is converted to a long-lived species. When KIR6.2 and SUR1 are co-expressed, complexes form quickly and the rapid degradation of KIR is eliminated. In the complex, SUR1 undergoes a time-dependent change in its glycosylation state as the channel transits to the cell surface. Two loss-of-function mutations, ΔF1388 in SUR1 and W91R in KIR6.2, both drastically decrease subunit lifetime irrespective of whether they are co-assembled with their partner subunit. Molecular Biology and Plasmid Construction—KIR6.2 and SUR1 proteins were modified by addition of extracellular Myc tags. The details of construction of the hamster pECE SUR1, pECE SUR1Myc, and human pECE KIR6.2 have been described (2Clement IV, J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L.

Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS m6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 4.5 g/liter glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Approximately 7 × 106 cells were transfected with 8 μg of the pECE SUR1 and/or 1 μg of the pECE KIR6.2 plasmids by electroporation (BioRad Laboratories, Inc.) following the manufacturer’s directions (950 μF, 0.220 V in 0.4-mm cuvettes in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1.25% Me2SO). The average efficiency of transfection was 7–10%, estimated by co-transfection with a green fluorescent protein-marker plasmid. There was no significant difference in transfection efficiency when multiple plasmids were used. Pulse-chase experiments were carried out 18 h after transfection. INS-1 β-cells, line 832/13 (29Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Dr. Christopher Newgard), were grown in RPMI 1640 with 11 mm d-glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Pulse-Chase and Immunoprecipitation Protocol—Cells were transfected and seeded in 6-well plates in duplicate at 70–80% confluence. The following day cells were incubated for 2 h in l-methionine/l-cysteine-free media (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Subsequently, cells were labeled for 60 min with a mixture of [35S]methionine/cysteine (200 μCi/ml; EaseTag™ mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences)and then incubated with pre-warmed Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5 mm unlabeled l-methionine/l-cysteine. At the indicated times, wells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected, and then lysed on a rotating wheel for 6 h at 20 °C in 1 ml of 1% digitonin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline plus cysteine and serine protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were clarified at 9000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were pre-absorbed for 1 h with protein-G plus and then incubated with anti-Myc or anti-KIR6.2 (N-18) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 20 °C followed by a 3-h incubation with protein-G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The agarose beads were washed five times with modified lysis buffer containing 0.1% digitonin. A modified 2× loading sample buffer (2.5% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.06 m Tris base, 20% glycerol, 0.008 m EDTA, pH 6.8) was added to the beads. Proteins were separated on 7.5% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Gels were stained, fixed in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, then treated with Fluorenhance (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, dried, and exposed to either x-ray film (Hyperfilm; (Eastman Kodak Co.) at 80 °C for 16–24 h or put on an intensifying screen for quantification with a Storm™ PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Note on Sample Preparation—The mobility of SUR1 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels is dependent on its glycosylation state; the immature or “core” glycosylated form displays an apparent molecular mass of ∼140 kDa and the mature, fully glycosylated form a mass of ∼150–170 kDa (1Nelson D.A.

Because maturation of membrane glycoproteins occurs in the medial Golgi apparatus (reviewed in Ref. 31Varki A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 34-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the mobility difference is a marker for trafficking of SUR1 (4Sharma N. Crane A. Clement IV, J.P.

During the course of these experiments we observed that inclusion of the usual heating step (95 °C, 5 min) in the preparation of samples for SDS-PAGE resulted in aggregation. Fig. 1, left panel shows the effect of heating solubilized immunoprecipitates containing SUR1Myc. The right panel shows a similar effect for fully glycosylated, Myc-tagged SUR1 present when the SUR and KIR subunits are co-expressed. Additionally, the lower right panel confirms an earlier report on the reduced recovery of KIR6.2 following heating (32Schwanstecher M. Loser S. Chudziak F. Panten U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17768-17771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The appearance of the heated, Myc-tagged SUR1 samples is not affected by treatment with endoglycosidases (data not shown). The samples in Fig. 1 were identified by photolabeling with 125I[azido] glibenclamide (2Clement IV, J.P. Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), but equivalent results were obtained using [35S]Met/Cys-labeled subunits. To avoid aggregation, samples were not subjected to heating before SDS-PAGE. Data Analysis—The relative intensities of bands were determined using phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). The data are plotted as intensity values or as the fraction remaining obtained by dividing by the zero time value. We have assumed homogenous compartments and that degradation of a given molecule is a random event. Single exponential functions were fit to the data, with the exception of KIR6.2 expressed in the absence of SUR where two exponentials were used. The results are expressed as the half-life for a given species. The half-life values can be converted to the mean residence times for a molecule in a compartment by dividing by 0.693. We used a simple two-compartment model in Modelmaker 4 (Cherwell Scientific, Ltd., Oxford, UK) to simulate the conversion of monomeric KIR6.2 to the tetramer and estimate the half-time for the assembly. All other fitting was done using the non-linear routines in Origin Pro (OriginLabs Corp., Northampton, MA). The results are given as mean ± S.D. Free KATP Channel Subunits Turn Over with Different Kinetics—SUR1 is a member of the ABC superfamily, specifically the ABCC subfamily. CFTR, another ABCC protein, whose turnover and trafficking has been examined in some detail, degrades rapidly in the ER, a t½ ∼30 min (26Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 27Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with only 20–40% estimated to leave the ER. The mature, fully glycosylated CFTR at the cell surface is longer-lived, reported t½ values of 7.5–16 h (26Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 27Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein (MDR1), another ABC protein, has reported half-lives of >24 h, whereas mutants have been described with t½ values of ∼3 h (33Yoshimura A. Kuwazuru Y. Sumizawa T. Ikeda S. Ichikawa M. Usagawa T. Akiyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 992: 307Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 35Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 35S[Met/Cys] pulse-chase experiments with COS m6 cells transfected with Myc-tagged SUR1, in the absence of KIR6.2, show there is no conversion to the mature species and that the immature receptor turns over slowly in the ER (Fig. 2A). A single exponential decay fits the data points reasonably well, giving an estimated half-life of ∼25.5 ± 4.4 h (n = 6) for SUR1 subunits in the ER in the absence of the inward rectifier. The turnover of KIR6.2 expressed alone is markedly different from SUR1. Turnover is biphasic with ∼60% of the 35S[Met/Cys]-labeled subunits being rapidly degraded with a half-life ∼35.7 ± 11.8 min. The remaining 40% turns over slowly with a half-life ∼26.1 ± 8.2 h (n = 3). KIR6.2 can assemble functional tetrameric pores in the absence of SUR that will reach the cell surface if their ER retention sequences are altered or deleted (36Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 37Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Drain P. Li L. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13953-13958Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus we propose that the biphasic decay of the KIR6.2 reflects a difference in the rates of degradation of unassembled subunits versus assembled pores. We used this two-state assumption and the estimated degradation rates to model the turnover assembly process. The estimated half-life for conversion of a KIR6.2 monomer into a stable species, assumed to be a tetramer, is ∼1.2 h. The solid line in Fig. 2B was calculated using these parameters. Maturation of KATP Channels—The 35S[Met/Cys] pulse-chase protocol followed by immunoprecipitation with either anti-KIR6.2 or anti-Myc antibodies was used to assess the assembly and maturation of KATP channels in COS m6 cells co-transfected with both SUR1 and KIR6.2. In principle, using two antibodies should provide information on the assembly of SUR1 with KIR6.2 complexes and vice versa. The results using the anti-KIR antibodies are shown in Fig. 3A. Co-expression with SUR1 markedly affects the turnover of KIR6.2. The rapid decay, evident in Fig. 2B when KIR6.2 is expressed alone, is missing. The amount of KIR6.2 in the immunoprecipitates increases over the first 60 min and then decays with a half-life of ∼8.5 ± 4 h, providing one measure of channel lifetime. The result implies SUR1 must rapidly associate with and stabilize the early assembly intermediates (Fig. 3A). This interpretation is supported by the observation that KIR6.2 and SUR1 co-immunoprecipitate at the earliest time point, increasing in amount for ∼2 h (compare first bands in Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, KIR6.2-SUR1 complexes were detectable after brief (10 min) pulse-labeling periods (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3B, there is essentially no detectable fully glycosylated SUR1 present at the earliest times, but the mature receptor becomes evident within 2 h, peaking at ∼10 h. Because the immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-KIR6.2 antibodies, SUR1 must be associated with KIR6.2. The appearance of the mature receptor as the core species disappears is consistent with a precursor-product relationship. The estimated half-life for conversion to mature SUR1 is ∼2.2 ± 0.14 h, based on fitting a single exponential (Fig. 3B, dotted line) to the disappearance of the immature form of the receptor beginning with the 2-h time point. The estimated half-life of the channel complex, based on fitting a single exponential to the mature SUR1 data, beginning with the 10-h time point, is ∼5.9 ± 1 h. This is in reasonable agreement with the ∼8.5 ± 4 h estimate for KIR6.2 because the KIR number will include contributions from any subunits not assembled with SUR1. The results for co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged SUR1 and KIR6.2 with anti-Myc antibodies are shown in Fig. 4. Consistent with the anti-KIR6.2 immunoprecipitation result (Fig. 3A), KIR6.2 does not turn over rapidly when associated with SUR1. There is a progressive increase in the amount of KIR6.2 precipitating with SUR1, with a peak at ∼5 h, consistent with slow sequential assembly. The estimated channel half-life, based on the lifetime for KIR6.2 associated with SUR1, is 7.8 ± 1.1 h. The precursor-product relation between immature and mature SUR1 is apparent with nearly the same timing (half-life for conversion of core-to-complex SUR1 is ∼2.6 ± 0.6 h). The estimated channel half-life, based on fitting a single exponential to the mature SUR1 data, is 6.9 ± 0.2 h. The ratio of immature SUR1-to-KIR6.2 at the end of the 35S[Met/Cys] pulse (t = 0) is higher than that observed for immunoprecipitation with anti-KIR6.2 (9.5 versus 2.9, respectively), implying SUR1 is in excess under these transfection conditions. This idea is supported by comparison of the later time points in the SUR1 intensity data in Figs. 3B and 4B. The maturation of SUR1, marked by conversion to the mature form, is essentially complete in less than 20 h for SUR1 associated with KIR6.2 (Fig. 3B), whereas the immature form remains readily detectable after 30 h in the anti-Myc immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4B). The result is consistent with there being non-KIR6.2-associated SUR1 in the ER that turns over slowly as shown in Fig. 1A. Increased Rates of Turnover for Two KATP Channel Mutants—A number of mutations in either SUR1 or KIR6.2 are known to cause familial hyperinsulinism (10Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 39Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. 2nd Ed.

Elsevier, New York2000: 299-325Crossref Google Scholar); several have been shown to affect trafficking, reportedly as a consequence of improper folding. We have used the 35S[Met/Cys] pulse-chase immunoprecipitation protocol to examine the turnover of two mutant subunits, SUR1 ΔF1388 and KIR6.2 W91R, expressed alone or with their respective partner. The ΔF1388 mutation is in the second nucleotide binding domain of SUR1 and has been identified as a common cause of familial hyperinsulinism in Ashkenazi populations (41Nestorowicz A. Wilson B.A. Schoor K.P. Inoue H. Glaser B. Landau H. Stanley C.A. Thornton P.S. Clement IV, J.P. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. Permutt M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The W91R mutation substitutes an arginine for the second in a pair of tryptophan residues near the top of KIR6.2 (10Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In KcsA, this tryptophan pair is in the pore helix and is thought to contribute significantly to the stability of the tetramer (42Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5763) Google Scholar). Both mutations are associated with severe forms of hyperinsulinism. Fig. 5 compares the turnover of KIR6.2 W91R versus wild type KIR6.2 subunits. KIR6.2 W91R is degraded rapidly in either the presence or absence of SUR1. The conversion to a long-lived species is missing in the mutant. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that KIR6.2 W91R subunits do associate with SUR1, but this association does not appear to slow degradation significantly. The estimated half-lives for the KIR6.2 W91R subunits in the absence and presence of SUR1 are 26.4 ± 2.4 min (n = 2) versus 34.0 ± 2.6 min (n = 2). These values are not significantly different from those determined for the fastest component observed when wild type KIR6.2 is expressed in the absence of SUR1 (35.7 ± 11.8 min; Fig. 2B). The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the W91R subunits are unable to assemble into stable tetramers and turn over rapidly as free monomers. To support this idea, we expressed Myc-tagged KIR6.2 with either KIR6.2 W91R or wild type KIR6.2 and then determined the levels of W91R versus wild type KIR6.2 in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6). The Myc tag does not substantially alter the properties of KIR6.2-SUR1 channels but has a greater molecular mass and serves to identify the “carrier” subunits in the immunoprecipitates. KIR6.2 W91R is degraded more rapidly than wild type KIR6.2, being nearly undetectable after 5 h, whereas the turnover of wild type KIR6.2 parallels that of the Myc-tagged KIR6.2 subunits (Fig. 6).Fig. 6W91R subunits are eliminated from KIR6.2 complexes. COS m6 cells were co-transfected with equimolar amounts of either the W91R or a wild type KIR6.2 plasmid plus the Myc-tagged KIR6.2 plasmid, pulse-labeled, and then processed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using anti-Myc antibodies. W91R subunits co-assemble with Myc-tagged KIR6.2 but dissociate and are progressively lost from the complexes, whereas the wild type and Myc-tagged KIRs have indistinguishable rates of turnover. Note that the pattern of turnover of Myc-tagged KIR6.2 differs somewhat from that of KIR6.2, suggesting the Myc-tagged subunit may convert more slowly to the stable species.

https://openalex.org/W1982982627,"Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for thrombin, is the prototypic member of a family of protease-activated receptors. PAR1 is irreversibly proteolytically activated; thus, the magnitude and duration of thrombin cellular responses are determined primarily by mechanisms responsible for termination of receptor signaling. Both phosphorylation and β-arrestins contribute to rapid desensitization of PAR1 signaling. However, the relative contribution of each of these pathways to the termination of PAR1 signaling is not known. Co-expression of PAR1 with β-arrestin 1 (βarr1) in COS-7 cells resulted in a marked inhibition of PAR1 signaling, whereas β-arrestin 2 (βarr2) was essentially inactive. Strikingly, signaling by a PAR1 cytoplasmic tail mutant defective in agonist-induced phosphorylation was also attenuated more effectively by βarr1 compared with βarr2. In contrast, both β-arrestin isoforms were equally effective at desensitizing the substance P receptor, a classic reversibly activated GPCR. PAR1 coimmunoprecipitated βarr1 in an agonist-dependent manner, whereas βarr2 association was virtually undetectable. Remarkably, βarr1 also interacted with phosphorylation defective PAR1 mutant, whereas βarr2 did not. Moreover, constitutively active β-arrestin mutants, βarr1 R169E and βarr2 R170E, that bind to activated receptor independent of phosphorylation failed to enhance either wild type or mutant PAR1 desensitization compared with normal versions of these proteins. In contrast, β-arrestin mutants displayed enhanced activity at desensitizing the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that, in addition to PAR1 cytoplasmic tail phosphorylation itself, β-arrestin binding independent of phosphorylation promotes desensitization of PAR1 signaling.

Thrombin, a coagulant protease, is generated at sites of vascular injury and produces a variety of cellular effects critical for hemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammatory and proliferative responses triggered by vascular damage (1Coughlin S.R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1994; 4: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2O'Brien P.J. Molino M. Kahn M. Brass L.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1570-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thrombin activates cells through at least three proteolytically activated G protein-coupled receptors: PAR1, 1 -3, and -4 (3Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). The prototype of this family, PAR1, is activated by an unusual irreversible proteolytic mechanism in which thrombin binds to and cleaves the amino-terminal exodomain of the receptor. This cleavage generates a new amino terminus that functions as a tethered ligand by binding intramolecularly to the body of the receptor to cause transmembrane signaling (4Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar, 5Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Hung D.T. Coughlin S.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide SFLLRN, which represents the newly formed amino terminus of the receptor, can activate PAR1 independent of thrombin and receptor cleavage. PAR1 is irreversibly activated; thus, the mechanisms that contribute to the termination of signaling are critical determinants of the magnitude and kinetics of the thrombin response in cells. Given the irreversible nature of PAR1 activation, we hypothesize that signal termination events are probably unique, since all other GPCRs are reversibly activated. The molecular events responsible for GPCR desensitization and resensitization have been extensively studied using the β2-adrenergic receptor (7Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 8Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In the classic paradigm, GPCRs are initially desensitized by rapid phosphorylation of activated receptors by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and other kinases. Receptor phosphorylation enhances the affinity of interaction with arrestins, and arrestin binding prevents receptor-G protein interaction, thereby uncoupling the receptor from signaling. Arrestins also interact with components of the endocytic machinery to facilitate recruitment of GPCRs to clathrin-coated pits and internalization from the plasma membrane (9Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 10Ferguson S.S. Downey W.r. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Once internalized into endosomes, GPCRs dissociate from their ligands, become dephosphorylated, and then return to the cell surface in a state capable of responding to ligand. Thus, for most classic, reversibly activated GPCRs, signaling is terminated at the plasma membrane, and receptor trafficking is linked to resensitization of signaling. Phosphorylation of activated PAR1 also appears to be important for rapid uncoupling from G protein signaling. Overexpression of either GRK3 or GRK5 enhances PAR1 phosphorylation and markedly inhibits inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation (11Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J.

A PAR1 mutant in which all of the serines and threonines in the cytoplasmic tail (C-tail) are converted to alanines (S/T→ A) is neither extensively phosphorylated nor inhibited by GRK3 overexpression in multiple cell types (11Ishii K.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2486-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently found that arrestins are also critical for the termination of PAR1 signaling. Desensitization of PAR1-promoted phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis is significantly impaired in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking both arrestin isoforms, arrestin 2 and arrestin 3 (also termed β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2), whereas PAR1 internalization remained intact (15Paing M.M.

However, in both wild-type and β-arrestin-deficient cells, phosphorylation of activated PAR1 is still necessary for internalization through clathrin-coated pits. Moreover, unlike classic GPCRs, proteolytically activated PAR1 is internalized and sorted rapidly to lysosomes, an event critical for termination of receptor signaling (16Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, PAR1 defines a new class of GPCRs that utilize a phosphorylation-, clathrin-, and dynamin-dependent pathway for endocytosis that operates independent of β-arrestins and receptor trafficking is linked to termination of signaling. The precise function of arrestins in signal regulation of a GPCR such as PAR1 that does not use these molecules for internalization through clathrin-coated pits has not been examined. Moreover, the relative contribution of phosphorylation versus β-arrestins to the termination of PAR1 signaling remains to be determined. In the present study, we used COS-7 cells to investigate the roles of phosphorylation and β-arrestins in uncoupling PAR1 from G protein signaling. Our findings strongly suggest that β-arrestins are able to bind and desensitize activated PAR1 independent of phosphorylation. Thus, these studies reveal a complex regulation of PAR1 signaling that involves both PAR1 C-tail phosphorylation and phosphorylation-independent binding of β-arrestins.

COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient Transfection—COS-7 cells were plated at 4 × 104 cells/well in fibronectin-coated 24-well dishes (Falcon) and grown overnight. Cells were then transiently transfected with a total of 0.4 μg of either PAR1, PAR1 mutants, SPR, or 5-HT2A receptor and either βarr1, βarr2, βarr mutants, or pcDNA using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen).

Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis—COS-7 cells plated at 4 × 104 cells/well of 24-well dishes were grown overnight, transiently transfected, and then labeled with 2 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) in serum-free DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 18–24 h. Cells were washed with DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES buffer, and 20 mm lithium chloride. Cells were then incubated in the absence or presence of either 10 nm α-thrombin, 100 nm substance P, or 10 μm 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenylisopropylamine diluted in DMEM containing lithium chloride for various times at 37 °C. Cell incubation medium was removed, and [3H]inositol phosphates ([3H]IPs) were extracted with 50 mm formic acid. Cell extracts were neutralized with 150 mm NH4OH, and IPs were isolated by column chromatography as described (15Paing M.M. Stutts A.B. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Trejo J. J. Biol.

Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using Prism 3.0 software, and statistical significance was determined using InStat 3.0 (GraphPAD, San Diego, CA). The initial rate of PAR1 desensitization was determined by quantifying the decrease in thrombin response over time. The data were normalized to the amount of [3H]IPs formed in untreated control cells for each time point. Cell Surface ELISA—Transiently transfected COS-7 cells plated at 4 × 104 cells/well in 24-well dishes were either left untreated or treated with 50 μm SFLLRN or 100 nm substance P for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 4 °C and then incubated with M1 anti-FLAG antibody for 1 h at 25 °C in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h at 25 °C. Cells were washed again and incubated with one-step 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethyl-benz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (Pierce) for 10–20 min at room temperature.

Immunoblotting and Coimmunoprecipitation—Lysates were prepared as previously described (17Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) from cells plated at 4 × 104 cells/well of 24-well dishes (Falcon) transiently transfected with PAR1 and various amounts of FLAG-tagged β-arrestins. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce), and equivalent amounts of lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred, and membranes were incubated with M1 anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000) overnight. To detect PAR1 and β-arrestin association, COS-7 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well dish, transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged PAR1 and β-arrestin cDNAs, and then stimulated with 50 μm SFLLRN for 2.5 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 200 μm sodium orthovanadate containing protease inhibitors, and equivalent amounts of lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with M2 anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-β-arrestin A1CT antibody (1:5000) or anti-PAR1 antibody (1:1000). Membranes were washed, incubated with species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000), and washed again. Immunoblots were developed with ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences), imaged by autoradiography, and quantitated by a Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips (22 × 22 mm) and incubated with M1 anti-FLAG antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, washed, and exposed to agonist at 37 °C. Cells were fixed and then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described (15Paing M.M. Stutts A.B. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Trejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1292-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Images were collected using an Fluoview 300 laser-scanning confocal imaging system (Olympus) configured with an IX70 fluorescent microscope fitted with a PlanApo × 60 oil objective (Olympus). The final composite image was created using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems). β-Arrestin-mediated Desensitization of PAR1 Signaling Is Independent of Receptor Phosphorylation—PAR1 couples to Gαq and stimulates PI hydrolysis through the activation of phospholipase C-β (21Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to determine the roles of phosphorylation and β-arrestins in PAR1 desensitization by measuring Gαq activation of PI hydrolysis in COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells are known to express low levels of endogenous β-arrestins (22Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.-T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 800-808Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We initially compared the signaling properties of PAR1 wild type and a phosphorylation-defective mutant that lacks all potential C-tail phosphorylation sites (S/T→ A) and is insensitive to GRK-mediated desensitization in multiple cell types including COS-7 (11Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hammes S.R. Shapiro M.J. Coughlin S.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2486-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The concentration effect curves for thrombin at wild type and mutant PAR1 were determined by incubating cells labeled with myo-[3H]inositol and varying concentrations of thrombin for 5 min at 37 °C. The accumulation of [3H]IPs was then measured. The effective concentration of thrombin to stimulate a half-maximal response after 5 min was similar for both PAR1 wild type and S/T→ A mutant in these studies (Fig. 1A). However, activated PAR1 S/T→ A mutant caused an enhanced maximal signaling response compared with wild type receptor (Fig. 1A). These findings suggest that each activated PAR1 S/T→ A mutant coupled longer to PI hydrolysis before signaling was shut off. Both phosphorylation and β-arrestins contribute to PAR1 desensitization (11Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Paing M.M. Stutts A.B. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Trejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1292-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, the relative contribution of each of these pathways to termination of PAR1 signaling remains to be determined. We initially compared the rates of agonist-induced PI hydrolysis in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with PAR1 and either βarr1 or βarr2 to establish that β-arrestins are capable of regulating PAR1 signaling in these cells. Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of a saturating concentration of thrombin for various times at 37 °C, and [3H]IPs were then measured. The initial rate of thrombin-induced PI hydrolysis was similar in all transfection conditions (Fig. 1B). After 30 min of agonist exposure, a marked ∼2.5-fold increase in PI hydrolysis was detected in cells expressing PAR1 only (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, agonist caused a similar ∼2.5-fold increase in IP accumulation in cells expressing PAR1 and βarr2 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that βarr2 does not play a significant role in PAR1 uncoupling from G protein signaling. In contrast, agonist-stimulated signaling was markedly impaired in cells expressing PAR1 and βarr1; an ∼1.5-fold increase in PI hydrolysis was detected after 30 min of agonist treatment (Fig. 1B), indicating that βarr1 is more effective than βarr2 at terminating PAR1 signaling. To examine the contribution of phosphorylation versus β-arrestin binding to PAR1 desensitization, we assessed signaling by the PAR1 S/T→ A phosphorylation-defective mutant in cells co-expressing either βarr1 or βarr2. In COS-7 cells expressing the PAR1 S/T→ A mutant, thrombin stimulated an ∼5-fold increase in PI hydrolysis (Fig. 1C), a response substantially greater than that observed with comparable amounts of wild type receptor in these same cells (Fig. 1B). Expression of βarr2 failed to significantly decrease signaling by PAR1 S/T→ A mutant (Fig. 1C), similar to that observed with wild type receptor. In contrast, however, βarr1 caused a marked ∼50% inhibition of PAR1 S/T→ A signaling (Fig. 1C), suggesting that βarr1-mediated PAR1 uncoupling from G protein signaling is independent of phosphorylation. We next examined whether the initial coupling of activated PAR1 to Gαq-promoted PI hydrolysis was affected by either βarr1 or βarr2. PAR1 wild type or S/T→ A mutant was transiently co-expressed with either βarr1 or βarr2, and the capacity of receptor to promote IP accumulation was compared. The concentration effect curves for thrombin at wild type and mutant PAR1 co-expressed with either βarr1, βarr2, or vector was shown in Fig. 2. The EC50 values for stimulation (5-min assay) of IP accumulation by thrombin were comparable in each transfection condition (Fig. 2, Table I). The maximal effect of 30 nm thrombin for stimulation of IP accumulation by PAR1 wild type and S/T→ A mutant co-expressed with either βarr1, βarr2, or vector was also similar (Fig. 2, Table I). Together, these findings imply that the initial coupling of activated PAR1 wild type and S/T→ A mutant to G protein-induced signaling response is not affected by βarrestins.Table IEffect of β-arrestins on relative efficacy and potency of thrombin at PAR1 wild type and S/T→A mutantReceptorRelative efficacyEC50nmPAR1 + pcDNA1.000 ± 0.0000.476 ± 0.066 + βarr10.918 ± 0.0180.391 ± 0.135 + βarr20.953 ± 0.0400.428 ± 0.027PAR1 S/T→A + pcDNA1.000 ± 0.0001.090 ± 0.119 + βarr10.938 ± 0.0291.451 ± 0.790 + βarr21.049 ± 0.0781.002 ± 0.275 Open table in a new tab To assess desensitization rates, COS-7 cells transiently expressing PAR1 wild type or S/T→A mutant together with either βarr1, βarr2, or vector were exposed to a saturating concentration of thrombin for 10 min at 37 °C. The extent of PAR1 signaling activity remaining after various times of thrombin incubation was then determined by the addition of lithium chloride and quantification of the amounts of IPs formed. In the absence of lithium chloride, thrombin-induced IP formation was not detectable in these cells (data not shown). In cells expressing PAR1 wild type only and either βarr1 or βarr2, the apparent rates of desensitization were not significantly different (Fig. 3A). These findings suggest that the major initiating event of PAR1 wild type desensitization is independent of β-arrestin binding. Interestingly, PAR1 S/T→A phosphorylation-defective mutant also showed a similar rate of desensitization in cells co-transfected with either βarr2 or vector only (Fig. 3B). In contrast, in cells co-expressing βarr1, the PAR1 S/T→A mutant desensitization appeared to occur more rapidly (Fig. 3B). At face value, these findings suggest that βarr1 enhances the rate of PAR1 desensitization independent of receptor phosphorylation. To determine whether other Gαq-linked GPCRs are similarly regulated by β-arrestins in COS-7 cells, we examined the effects of β-arrestins on signaling by the substance P receptor (SPR), also known as the neurokinin-1 receptor. In COS-7 cells expressing SPR only, a ∼3.3-fold increase in IP formation was measured after 30 min of agonist exposure (Fig. 4A). In contrast to responses observed with PAR1, agonist-stimulated SPR signaling is substantially diminished in cells expressing either βarr1 or βarr2 (Fig. 4A), suggesting that both βarr1 and βarr2 are equally effective at uncoupling activated SPR from G protein signaling in these cells. These findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that activated SPR is rapidly desensitized via a GRK-mediated redistribution, and presumably binding, of β-arrestins to the receptor in other cell types (23Barak L.S.

In addition, these results establish that heterologous expression of βarr2 is able to desensitize GPCR signaling in COS-7 cells. We also examined the ability of βarrestins to directly modulate signaling by Gαq to ensure that ectopic expression of β-arrestins does not globally disrupt signaling by this G protein in COS-7 cells. In cells overexpressing wild type Gαq, the basal IP accumulation measured after 30 min of incubation in medium containing lithium chloride was comparable with that measured in vector control cells (Fig. 4B). Compared with Gαq wild type or vector control cells, the GTPase deficient, constitutively active mutant of Gαq Q205L caused a ∼5.5-fold increase in PI hydrolysis (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, however, expression of either βarr1 or βarr2 failed to diminish the Gαq Q205L signaling response (Fig. 4B), suggesting that neither βarr1 nor βarr2 globally disrupts signaling by Gαq in COS-7 cells. We next assessed thrombin-stimulated PI hydrolysis in cells expressing wild type and mutant PAR1 and varying amounts of the individual β-arrestin isoforms to exclude the possibility that the differential effects of β-arrestins on PAR1 signaling are due to differences in the levels of β-arrestin expression. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with either PAR1 wild type or S/T→ A mutant and varying amounts of FLAG-tagged βarr1 or FLAG-tagged βarr2 were incubated in the absence or presence of agonist for 30 min at 37 °C. The generation of IPs was then measured, or cell lysates were prepared, and β-arrestin expression was detected by immunoblotting. In the absence of β-arrestin expression, an ∼2-fold and ∼4-fold increase in IP accumulation was detected in PAR1 wild type- and S/T→ A mutant-expressing cells following 30 min of agonist exposure, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 1). In cells expressing wild type PAR1 and maximum amounts of βarr2, activated PAR1 signaling was modestly diminished by ∼20% (Fig. 5A), whereas βarr1 caused a significantly greater 50% inhibition of agonist-stimulated signaling (Fig. 5A). In PAR1 S/T→ A mutant-expressing cells, agonist-stimulated PI hydrolysis was decreased more effectively by βarr1 compared with βarr2 (Fig. 5B), similar to the results observed with wild type receptor. However, both β-arrestin isoforms were quite efficacious at attenuating thrombin-induced PI hydrolyis, suggesting that the PAR1 S/T→ A mutant is more sensitive than wild type receptor to β-arrestins. Regardless, in cells expressing comparable amounts of βarr1 and βarr2, the βarr1 isoform appears more effective than βarr2 at terminating activated PAR1 signaling even in the absence of receptor phosphorylation. β-Arrestins Fail to Enhance PAR1 Internalization in COS-7 Cells—To determine whether the differential effects of β-arrestins on PAR1 signaling result from differences in receptor trafficking, we examined agonist-induced receptor i"
https://openalex.org/W1998213298,"To identify tumor antigens for glioma, a human testis cDNA library was screened by serological identification of antigens by recombinant expression cloning with sera from glioma patients. In this screening, the most frequently isolated antigen was SOX6, an Sry-related high-mobility group (HMG) box-containing gene. SOX6 is a transcriptional factor that is specifically expressed in the developing central nervous system and in the early stages of chondrogenesis in mouse embryos. IgG antibodies against SOX6 were detected in sera from 12 of 36 glioma patients (33.3%), 0 of 14 patients with other brain disease (0%), and one of 54 other cancer patients (1.9%). In sera from 37 healthy individuals, no IgG responses against SOX6 were detected, except in an elderly female. Furthermore, Western blot and ELISA analyses with sera from glioma patients revealed that the DNA-binding domain, the HMG box of SOX6, might be a dominant epitope of IgGs against SOX6. RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis revealed that the SOX6 gene was more highly expressed in glioma tissues than in normal adult tissues, except testis. Western blot analysis with an anti-SOX6 antibody demonstrated that the SOX6 protein was expressed in glioma tissues, but not in normal adult brain tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis with the anti-SOX6 antibody showed that all the glioma tissues analysed expressed SOX6 in tumor cells, but only a few SOX6-positive cells were detected in non-neoplastic tissues from the cerebral cortex. In summary, these results indicate that the developmentally regulated transcription factor SOX6 is aberrantly expressed in glioma and specifically recognized by IgGs from glioma patients' sera."
https://openalex.org/W2039173160,"We have used chicken cDNA microarrays to investigate gene-expression changes induced during transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) by the viral Jun oncoprotein encoded by ASV17. This analysis reveals that v-Jun induces increases and decreases of varying magnitude in the expression of genes involved in diverse cellular functions, most of which have not been detected in previous screens for putative v-Jun targets. In all, 27 individual genes were identified, whose expression is increased threefold or more in v-Jun-transformed cells, including genes involved in energy generation, protein synthesis, and gene transcription. Interestingly, this group includes the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (Hif-1alpha) transcription factor and the glycolytic enzyme enolase, suggesting that adaptation to hypoxia could play a role in tumorigenesis by v-Jun. We also identified 32 genes whose expression is decreased threefold or more, including chaperones, components of the cytoskeleton, and, unexpectedly, DNA replication factors. The gene whose expression is upregulated most dramatically (approximately 100-fold) encodes Autotaxin (ATX), a secreted tumor motility-promoting factor with lysophospholipase D activity. Strikingly, v-Jun-transformed CEF secrete catalytically active ATX and chemotactic activity, which can be detected in conditioned medium. ATX is not detectably expressed in normal CEF or CEF transformed by the v-Src or v-Myc oncoproteins, indicating that induction of this putative autocrine/paracrine factor is a specific consequence of cell transformation by v-Jun. ATX has been implicated in both angiogenesis and invasion, and could therefore play an important role in tumorigenesis by v-Jun in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2000444287,"Calnexin is a membrane-bound lectin of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that binds transiently to newly synthesized glycoproteins. By interacting with oligosaccharides of the form Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, calnexin enhances the folding of glycoprotein substrates, retains misfolded variants in the ER, and in some cases participates in their degradation. Calnexin has also been shown to bind polypeptides in vivo that do not possess a glycan of this form and to function in vitro as a molecular chaperone for nonglycosylated proteins. To test the relative importance of the lectin site compared with the polypeptide-binding site, we have generated six calnexin mutants defective in oligosaccharide binding using site-directed mutagenesis. Expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusions, these mutants were still capable of binding ERp57, a thiol oxidoreductase, and preventing the aggregation of a nonglycosylated substrate, citrate synthase. They were, however, unable to bind Glc1 Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide and were compromised in preventing the aggregation of the monoglucosylated substrate jack bean α-mannosidase. Two of these mutants were then engineered into full-length calnexin for heterologous expression in Drosophila cells along with the murine class I histocompatibility molecules Kb and Db as model glycoproteins. In this system, lectin site-defective calnexin was able to replace wild type calnexin in forming a complex with Kb and Db heavy chains and preventing their degradation. Thus, at least for class I molecules, the lectin site of calnexin is dispensable for some of its chaperone functions. Calnexin is a membrane-bound lectin of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that binds transiently to newly synthesized glycoproteins. By interacting with oligosaccharides of the form Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, calnexin enhances the folding of glycoprotein substrates, retains misfolded variants in the ER, and in some cases participates in their degradation. Calnexin has also been shown to bind polypeptides in vivo that do not possess a glycan of this form and to function in vitro as a molecular chaperone for nonglycosylated proteins. To test the relative importance of the lectin site compared with the polypeptide-binding site, we have generated six calnexin mutants defective in oligosaccharide binding using site-directed mutagenesis. Expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusions, these mutants were still capable of binding ERp57, a thiol oxidoreductase, and preventing the aggregation of a nonglycosylated substrate, citrate synthase. They were, however, unable to bind Glc1 Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide and were compromised in preventing the aggregation of the monoglucosylated substrate jack bean α-mannosidase. Two of these mutants were then engineered into full-length calnexin for heterologous expression in Drosophila cells along with the murine class I histocompatibility molecules Kb and Db as model glycoproteins. In this system, lectin site-defective calnexin was able to replace wild type calnexin in forming a complex with Kb and Db heavy chains and preventing their degradation. Thus, at least for class I molecules, the lectin site of calnexin is dispensable for some of its chaperone functions.

Its ER luminal portion is comprised of a globular lectin domain that binds Ca2+ and recognizes the monoglucosylated Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide (1Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). They also act as components of the quality control machinery, retaining misfolded or incompletely folded substrates within the ER (13Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 263: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 14Rajagopalan S. Brenner M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that CNX has a role in ER-associated degradation by binding and delivering substrates to the ER degradation-enhancing mannosidase-like protein, a mannose-specific lectin that targets glycoproteins for retrotranslocation to the cytosol where they are degraded by the proteosome (15Oda Y. Hosokawa N. Wada I. Nagata K. Science. 2003; 299: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 16Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P. Science. 2003; 299: 1397-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The signal for degradation is the conversion of the oligosaccharide from Man9GlcNAc2 to a Man8GlcNAc2 form by an ER mannosidase, as shown by the block of degradation by the mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine (17Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).There are two conflicting models for the function of CNX and CRT as ER chaperones, the lectin-only (18Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 19Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) and the dual-binding models (1Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 20Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the lectin-only model, binding of CNX and CRT to folding glycoproteins is regulated by the availability of the terminal glucose residue on the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide. After the initial formation of the monoglucosylated oligosaccharide by the action of glucosidase II, cycles of dissociation and rebinding are catalyzed by the further action of glucosidase II, which removes the glucose residue, and by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, which reattaches it selectively to incompletely folded glycoproteins (21Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 22Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). According to the lectin-only model, CNX and CRT bind to glycoproteins that remain in the cycle and promote their folding by recruitment of various folding factors. This view is supported by the finding that both CNX and CRT can recruit the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 to oxidize disulfide bonds in the folding glycoprotein (23Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6009-6012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In addition, the lectin-only mode of binding is supported by the finding that treatment of cells with castanospermine, a glucosidase inhibitor that prevents the formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides, results in the elimination of CNX/CRT interactions with many glycoprotein substrates (reviewed in Ref. 6Parodi A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).In the dual-binding model, CNX and CRT are proposed to possess a polypeptide-binding site in addition to the lectin site that allows them to function as more typical chaperones, promoting folding by preventing aggregation. Several lines of evidence support the dual-binding model. First, it has been observed that in the presence of castanospermine, select substrates remain associated with CNX or CRT under mild isolation conditions (reviewed in Ref. 24Danilczyk U.G. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25532-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Also, in Lec23 and PhaR2.7 cells, which do not express glucosidases required for the formation of monoglucosylated glycans, an interaction can be observed between CNX and many substrates (24Danilczyk U.G. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25532-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have further shown that CNX and CRT can function as molecular chaperones by preventing the aggregation not only of glycoproteins but of nonglycosylated substrates as well (20Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Saito Y. Ihara Y. Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6718-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when challenged with a denatured monoglucosylated substrate, CNX has a marked advantage in preventing aggregation over a conventional peptide-binding chaperone such as BiP, an ER Hsp70, suggesting that the lectin site can act in concert with an additional polypeptide-binding site (27Stronge V.S. Saito Y. Ihara Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39779-39787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These two binding modes allow for the promotion of folding and assembly of a diverse spectrum of glycoproteins, while retaining improperly folded substrates and in some cases targeting them for ER-associated degradation.To further address the relative importance of the lectin versus polypeptide-based interactions in the chaperone functions of CNX, we have engineered point mutants within the lectin site and assessed their ability to bind radiolabeled Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. These mutants were then tested for their abilities to bind ERp57 and to prevent the aggregation of glycosylated or nonglycosylated substrates. Select mutants were then co-expressed with class I histocompatibility molecules in Drosophila cells to assess their ability to replace wild type CNX. The results indicate that lectin-deficient CNX retains many aspects of its in vitro and in vivo chaperone functions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Mutagenesis—The generation of CNX point mutants for in vitro experiments utilized a plasmid in which glutathione S-transferase (GST) was fused to the N terminus of the soluble ER luminal domain of CNX(CNX 1–461). This plasmid (pGEX-sCNX) has been described previously (28Vassilakos A. Michalak M. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3480-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For the production of CNX point mutants for expression in Drosophila melanogaster cells, cDNA encoding full-length CNX in the Drosophila expression vector pRMHa3 was used (designated pRMHa3-CNX) (13Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 263: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Additional pRMHa3 plasmids encoding the murine class I heavy chains H-2Kb and H-2Db as well as β2-microglobulin (β2m) have been described previously (13Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Williams D.B. Science. 1994; 263: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to mutate six CNX residues involved in oligosaccharide binding utilizing both the pGEX-sCNX and pRMHa3-CNX plasmids as templates. The following mutagenic primers were used and were designed to either introduce or remove a restriction site as indicated; mutagenic bases are shown in lowercase type: Y165A, 5′-GAATGTGGTGGTGCtgcaGTGAAACTGCTTTCC-3′ (addition of PstI site); K167A, 5′-GGTGCCTATGTGgcACTGCTTTCgAAAACCCCCG-3′ (addition of BstBI site); Y186A, 5′-CCACGACAAGACgCCggcTACGATTATGTTTGG-3′ (addition of NaeI site); M189A, 5′-CCCCTTATACGATTgcGTTTGGgCCcGATAAATGTGG-3′ (addition of ApaI site); E217A, 5′-GGCGTATATGAAGcAAAaCATGCTAAGAGG-3′ (loss of SphI site); and E426A, 5′-GCGCTATTGGgcTaGcACTGTGGTCTATGACC-3′ (addition of NheI site). The construction of the GST-fused arm domain of CNX, pGEX-sCNX(257–387), was previously described (3Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29686-29697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—Plasmids were transfected into BL-21 Gold (Stratagene) Escherichia coli cells, and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 (Buffer A), sonicated, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g. The supernatant fractions were applied to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h followed by washing with buffer A and elution with buffer A containing 20 mm reduced glutathione. The samples were then subjected to NAP-25 gel filtration (Amersham Biosciences) to remove glutathione and concentrated using a Centricon-10 membrane concentrator (Millipore). All of the proteins were judged greater than 90% pure by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay.Oligosaccharide Binding Assay—The dolichol-PP-oligosaccharide fraction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain alg8 (29Runge K.W. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15582-15590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to isolate radiolabeled [3H]Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 as described previously (1Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Binding to GST-fused CNX proteins was performed for 30 min at 4 °C in 100 μl of buffer A containing ∼2000 cpm of [3H]Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 and 1 μm GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were centrifuged for 5 s at 10,000 × g and washed once with buffer A. The bound oligosaccharide was eluted by resuspension in 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, and heating at 50 °C for 5 min. Following centrifugation for 5 s at 10,000 × g, oligosaccharide in the supernatant fraction was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. All of the experiments included the entire GST-fused ER luminal domain of CNX (CNX(1–461)) as a positive control plus a GST-negative control. The results are reported as the average percentages of binding above GST background compared with CNX(1–461) control on an equimolar basis for replicate experiments. Typically, with 2000 cpm input oligosaccharide, 300 cpm (15%) was bound by full-length GST-CNX(1–461).ERp57 Binding Assay—ERp57 was expressed from a pET vector transformed into BL-21 Gold E. coli cells by inducing with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C (23Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6009-6012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A, sonicated, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a MonoQ anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), and ERp57 was eluted with a NaCl gradient. ERp57-containing fractions were pooled and then concentrated using a Centricon 10 membrane concentrator (Amicon) changing the buffer to 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.0, by repeated dilutions of the concentrated protein. ERp57 was radiolabeled with N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidyl-[14C]acetate as described previously (3Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29686-29697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). GST fusion constructs, immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and suspended at a concentration of 1 μm, were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 100 μl of buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 μm ERp57 or 1 μm [14C]Ac-ERp57. Agarose beads were centrifuged for 5 s at 10,000 × g, washed twice with buffer A, and eluted with buffer A containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. For nonradioactive samples, the eluted fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-ERp57 antibody (gift from Dr. D. Thomas, McGill University) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Radioactive eluates were quantified by liquid scintillation counting and compared with the GST-fused ER luminal domain of CNX (CNX(1–461)) as a positive control plus a GST-negative control. The results are expressed as the average percentages of binding above GST background relative to the CNX(1–461) control. Typically radioactivity recovered in eluted samples ranged from 500 to 1000 cpm.Aggregation Assays—Citrate synthase (CS; Sigma) and jack bean α-mannosidase (α-Man; Sigma) were desalted using NAP-25 gel filtration with buffer A as the mobile phase. Desalted α-Man was lyophilized then dissolved in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride (Sigma) at a concentration of 24 μm. CS (1 μm) was mixed with GST fusion construct (0.5 μm) in buffer A in a total assay volume of 500 μl, and aggregation was assessed by monitoring light scattering at 360 nm for 1 h at 45 °C. α-Man was rapidly diluted to 0.36 μm with 500 μl of GST fusion construct (0.36–0.72 μm) containing buffer A. Aggregation was monitored as for CS but at 15 °C for 5 min.Cell Lines and Antibodies—In the pRMHa3 vector, all of the cDNAs are under the control of the metallothionein promoter (30Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Stably transfected Drosophila cell lines were established by co-transfecting by the calcium phosphate method a phshsneo plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene along with one or more pRMHa3 plasmids encoding the H-2Kb heavy chain, the H-2Db heavy chain, β2m, CNX, or CNX point mutants. To ensure that all of the proteins were expressed within one cell, the cell lines were cloned using the soft agar technique (31Hapel A.J. Lee J.C. Farrar W.L. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1981; 25: 179-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After screening for expression by metabolic radiolabeling and immunoisolation, clones with comparable protein expression levels were chosen for all subsequent experiments. D. melanogaster Schneider cells were maintained in Schneider’s insect medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Stably transfected cell lines were cultured in the presence of 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). The following mAbs were used for the isolation of class I molecules: mAb 28-14-8S, which recognizes a conformational epitope in the α3 domain of free or β2 m-associated Db heavy chains (32Ozato K. Hansen T.H. Sachs D.H. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2473-2477PubMed Google Scholar), and mAb 20-8-4S, which reacts with Kb heavy chains associated with β2m (33Ozato K. Sachs D.H. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 317-321PubMed Google Scholar). A rabbit antiserum (anti-HC) directed against inclusion bodies of soluble Db recognizes unfolded Db heavy chains and was provided by Dr. Hidde Ploegh (Harvard University) (34Machold R.P. Andree S. Kaer L.V Ljunggren H.-G. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A rabbit antiserum (anti-8) directed against the C terminus of the H-2Kb H chain, which reacts with all conformational states of Kb, was provided by Dr. Brian Barber (University of Toronto) (35Smith M.H. Parker J.M. Hodges R.S. Barber B.H. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 1077-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For isolation of CNX, a rabbit antiserum directed against the native 462-residue ER luminal domain of dog calnexin was used (24Danilczyk U.G. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25532-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Metabolic Radiolabeling, Immunoisolation, and Gel Electrophoresis—Expression of transfected cDNAs in Drosophila cells was induced by incubation with 1 mm CuSO4 for 16 h, and then cells were incubated for 30 min in Met-free Grace’s insect medium. The cells were radiolabeled with [35S]Met for 5 min, chased for various times, and lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, containing 1% digitonin, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 1% aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin. For experiments with Kb, the lysates were precleared for 1 h with a preimmune serum followed by protein A-agarose beads. The lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-class I or anti-CNX antibodies followed by recovery of immune complexes by incubation for 1 h with protein-A agarose beads. Immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% or 12.5% gels, and the radioactive proteins were visualized by fluorography. For quantitation of bands, the fluorograms were scanned and then analyzed using National Institutes of Health Image software.RESULTSLectin Site Mutants of Calnexin Are Impaired in Oligosaccharide Binding—From the x-ray structure of CNX co-crystallized with α-d-glucose (2Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), six residues that presumably contact the terminal glucose of the natural Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide were identified (Fig. 1). Tyr165, Lys167, Tyr186, Glu217, and Glu426 all form hydrogen bonds to glucose hydroxyl groups, whereas the hydrophobic Met189 lies underneath the glucose ring within van der Waals’ contact distance (2Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).To assess the contributions of these individual interactions to Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 binding, each of the six residues was mutated to Ala in the context of the soluble, luminal domain of CNX fused to GST. The purified proteins were immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with radiolabeled [3H]Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. From the binding results shown in Fig. 2A, five of the six point mutants were sufficient to drop oligosaccharide binding to a background level seen with the arm domain alone. We have previously shown that the arm domain construct exhibits a low level of oligosaccharide binding that is not specific for monoglucosylated species and thus represents the background binding of oligosaccharide in a completely lectin-deficient mutant (3Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29686-29697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Only the M189A mutant exhibited slight binding above the background of the arm domain. Therefore, the loss of even a single hydrogen bonding residue is sufficient to ablate lectin function.Fig. 2Oligosaccharide and ERp57 binding by lectinsite-mutants of calnexin.A, immobilized GST fusion constructs of the ER luminal segment of CNX (wt CNX), the indicated lectin site point mutants, and the arm domain were incubated with [3H]Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing beads once, bound oligosaccharide was eluted by chelation of calcium necessary for binding and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Oligosaccharide binding is expressed as a percentage of the specific binding observed for wild type CNX (350–500 cpm) after subtraction of background binding for GST alone (50–100 cpm). The values are the averages of four replicate experiments with error bars representing the standard error. B and C, the ER luminal segment of CNX or the lectin site mutants fused to GST were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (1 μm) and incubated with 0.1 μm ERp57 or 1 μm [14C]Ac-ERp57. The beads were washed twice, and bound ERp57 was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione and either separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with an anti-ERp57 antibody (B) or detected directly by scintillation counting (C). The error bars represent the standard errors in a minimum of three replicate experiments. The asterisk denotes a degradation product of ERp57.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Lectin Site Mutants of Calnexin Are Capable of Binding ERp57 and Preventing Aggregation—To ensure that the point mutations had not severely affected the folding of CNX, we tested each for binding of the oxidoreductase ERp57. Because the binding site for ERp57 is known to be within the arm domain of CNX (3Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29686-29697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 4Frickel E.M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In all six mutants, binding of ERp57 was not substantially impaired as assessed either qualitatively by pull-down and Western blotting (Fig. 2B) or quantitatively by assessing the amount of radiolabeled ERp57 bound to GST-immobilized CNX mutants (Fig. 2C).It is possible that point mutations within the lectin site could affect binding of unfolded polypeptides, because we have previously shown that the globular domain is the site of non-native polypeptide binding, although assisted by the presence of the arm domain (3Leach M.R.

To address this possibility, the ability of the six GST-fused CNX mutants to prevent the thermal aggregation of CS was tested. As shown in Fig. 3A, GST had no effect on CS aggregation, whereas GST fused to the ER luminal domain of CNX almost completely suppressed aggregation at a CS:CNX ratio of 1:0.5 and fully suppressed aggregation at a ratio of 1:2. When tested at a CS:CNX ratio of 1:0.5, all six mutants were able to prevent the aggregation of CS at levels not significantly different from that of wild type CNX, indicating that their polypeptide-binding site was not impaired by the point mutation (Fig. 3B). Additionally all six mutants, like wild type CNX, were stable at 45 °C with no signs of aggregation for the 1-h assay period, demonstrating that their thermal stability was not compromised by the point mutation (data not shown).Fig. 3Aggregation suppression of a nonglycosylated and a monoglucosylated substrate by lectinsitemutants of calnexin.A, CS (1 μm) was incubated at 45 °C alone or in the presence of GST (2 μm) or GST-CNX (0.5 or 2 μm).

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a cytokine produced by macrophages, is a primary inducer of angiogenesis and neovascularization in these contexts. VEGF expression by macrophages is known to be stimulated by low oxygen tension as well as by inflammatory signals. In this study, we provide evidence that Vegfa gene expression is also regulated by activation of liver X receptors (LXRs). VEGF mRNA was induced in response to synthetic LXR agonists in murine and human primary macrophages as well as in murine adipose tissue in vivo. The effects of LXR ligands on VEGF expression were independent of hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α activation and did not require the previously characterized hypoxia response element in the VEGF promoter. Rather, LXR/retinoid X receptor heterodimers bound directly to a conserved hormone response element (LXRE) in the promoter of the murine and human Vegfa genes. Both LXRα and LXRβ transactivated the VEGF promoter in transient transfection assays. Finally, we show that induction of VEGF expression by inflammatory stimuli was independent of LXRs, because these effects were preserved in LXR null macrophages. These observations identify VEGF as an LXR target gene and point to a previously unrecognized role for LXRs in vascular biology.

A ligand for the tyrosine kinase receptors VEGFR1 (Flk-1/KDR) and VEGFR2 (Flt-1), VEGF triggers a variety of effects on vascular endothelial cells. VEGF elicits a strong angiogenic response in several models, including the chick chorioallantoic membrane (1Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N.

Inhibition of VEGF activity in endothelial cells of tumor-associated blood vessels results in tumor regression, indicating that VEGF is a major initiator of tumor angiogenesis (5Kim K.J. Li B.

Nature. 1994; 367: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). In addition to its decisive role in vessel formation, VEGF affects maturation of bone marrow-derived cell populations. First, VEGF treatment enhances colony formation by mature subsets of granulocyte macrophage and erythroid progenitor cells that have been pre-stimulated with colony-stimulating factor in vitro (7Broxmeyer H.E.

Second, VEGF administration induces a rapid mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells and circulating endothelial precursor cells (8Hattori K. Dias S. Heissig B. Hackett N.R. Lyden D. Tateno M.

Finally, VEGF-deficient bone marrow cells fail to repopulate lethally irradiated hosts in bone marrow transplantation experiments (9Gerber H.P. Malik A.K. Solar G.P. Sherman D. Liang X.H. Meng G. Hong K. Marsters J.C. Ferrara N. Nature. 2002; 417: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Several independent pathways have been described to regulate Vegfa gene expression. Among these, hypoxia and hypoglycemia play a major role, both in vitro and in vivo. Hypoxia-induced regulation of VEGF mRNA is mediated by direct binding of a heterodimeric helix-loop-helix transcription factor known as hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) to a response element in the proximal VEGF promoter (10Wang G.L.

Under normoxic conditions, the HIF-1 complex is actively targeted for proteasomal degradation by a ubiquitin-ligase complex that relies on the VHL protein (12Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W.

In addition to hypoxia, numerous cytokines and growth factors, including endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor α, transforming growth factor β, keratinocyte growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, interleukin 1, and interleukin 6 can regulate VEGF expression in different cell types (13Frank S.

VEGF is up-regulated during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells (17Claffey K. Wilkison W. Spiegelman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16317-16322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, VEGF transcription is repressed during neuronal differentiation of pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Macrophages play a key role in the induction of angiogenesis under fibroproliferative conditions, including wound healing, rheumatoid arthritis, and solid tumor development. Although resting monocytes and macrophages exhibit a nonangiogenic phenotype under normoxic conditions, hypoxia, elevated lactate levels, and inflammation strongly stimulate VEGF production (18Itaya H. Imaizumi T. Yoshida H. Koyama M. Suzuki S. Satoh K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or with CD40L stimulates VEGF production in human primary macrophages (19Xiong M. Elson G. Legarda D. Leibovich S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This effect has been reported to be NFκB-dependent, because it is sensitive to the overexpression of the inhibitory protein, IκBα (20Kiriakidis S. Andreakos E. Monaco C. Foxwell B. Feldmann M. Paleolog E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In mouse peritoneal macrophages, LPS induces only a modest increase in VEGF expression, however this effect is strongly enhanced by co-treatment with adenosine A2A receptor agonists (21Leibovich S.J.

The liver X receptors α and β (LXRα and LXRβ) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor family that form obligate heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). LXR/RXR heterodimers bind to DR-4-type sequence elements known as LXR response elements (LXREs) in their target genes. Oxidized derivatives of cholesterol (oxysterols), such as 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol or 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol have been described as endogenous ligands for LXR (22Tontonoz P. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 23Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). LXRα is highly expressed in tissues rich in lipid metabolism, such as white adipose tissue, liver, intestine, and macrophages, whereas LXRβ is ubiquitously expressed (23Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The endogenous functions of the two LXRs appear to overlap significantly. In liver, where LXRα is very highly expressed, this receptor appears to play a particularly important role in the control of genes linked to cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism such as Srebp-1c and Cyp7a1 (24Repa J.J.

The blots were normalized using cDNA probes to 36B4 and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) analysis. Real Time Quantitative PCR—Assays were performed using an Applied Biosystems 7700 sequence detector. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamers using the Taqman reverse transcription reagent kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Each Taqman reaction (50 μl) contained 50 ng of cDNA, 900 nm forward primer, 900 nm reverse primer, 100 nm dual-labeled fluorogenic probe (IDT), and 25 μl of Universal PCR Master mix (Qiagen). PCR thermocycling parameters were 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. All samples were analyzed for 36B4 expression in parallel. The quantitative expression values were extrapolated from standard curves for VEGF or 36B4. Each sample was run in duplicate and was normalized to 36B4. The replicates were then averaged and fold induction was determined. Statistical analysis of mRNA expression data in white adipose tissue was performed by using the two-tailed, homoscedastic t test. Probe and primer sequences are available on request. Mobility Shift Assays—In vitro translated RXR and LXR were generated from pCMX-RXR and pCMX-hLXR plasmids by using the TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Gel-shift assays were performed as described (29Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10638-10647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) by using in vitro translated proteins and the following oligonucleotides (only one strand is shown): human VEGF wt, 5′-caggaaagtgAGGTTAcgtgCGGACAgggcctgaga-3′; human VEGF mut, 5′-caggaaagtgAAGTTAcgtgCAGACAgggcctgaga-3′; mouse VEGF wt, 5′-caggagagtgAGGTTAtatgCGGACAgggtctaaga-3′; mouse VEGF mut, 5′-caggagagtgAAGTTAtatgCAGACAgggtctaaga-3′; human LXR, 5′-gatcgctgAGGTTActgcTGGTCAttca-3′; mouse ApoE, 5′-gatcgctgccaGGGTCActggCGGTCAaaggcag-3′. We have described previously the use of Affymetrix cDNA arrays to identify LXR target genes in macrophages (30Joseph S.B. Castrillo A. Laffitte B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). These studies led to the identification of VEGF as a potential LXR-regulated gene (data not shown). To confirm these results, we examined the ability of synthetic LXR agonists to regulate expression of Vegfa gene in primary murine and human macrophages. As VEGF expression is known to be responsive to a number of signaling pathways including factors present in serum, we investigated the regulation of VEGF expression in macrophages cultured in serum-free medium. Thioglycolateelicited murine peritoneal macrophages were cultured in a medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin (0.2%) and treated for 24 h with one of two structurally unrelated synthetic LXR agonists, GW3965 or T1317. VEGF mRNA expression was determined by real time quantitative PCR (Taqman) assays (Fig. 1A) or Northern blotting (Fig. 1B). Both GW3965 and T1317 led to a moderate, 2–3-fold induction in VEGF mRNA expression. Co-treatment with the RXR selective agonist LG268 (31Boehm M.F. Zhang L. Zhi L. McClurg M.R. Berger E. Wagoner M. Mais D.E. Suto C.M. Davies J.A. Heyman R.A. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 32Mukherjee R. Davies P.J. Crombie D.L. Bischoff E.D. Cesario R.M. Jow L.

Induction of VEGF by LXR was particularly dependent on the combined presence of RXR agonist (Fig. 1). The maximal expression of VEGF mRNA induced by LXR and RXR agonists in fetal bovine serum and serum-free conditions was similar; however, the fold induction by ligand was greater in the absence of serum because of lower levels of basal expression (data not shown). In contrast to the results obtained with LXR agonists, treatment of murine or human macrophages with high affinity ligands for PPARα (GW7647), PPARδ (GW1516), or PPARγ (GW7845) had no effect on VEGF mRNA (Fig. 2). To determine whether the ability of synthetic LXR ligands to modulate VEGF expression was dependent on the expression of LXRs, we examined their effects in peritoneal macrophages derived from wild type mice or mice lacking LXRα, LXRβ, or both receptors. Peritoneal macrophages were cultured in vitro in the presence or absence of LXR and/or RXR agonists. T1317, GW3965, and LG268 were effective inducers of VEGF expression in wild type cells (Fig. 3A). Induction by LXR and RXR ligand was unaltered in cells lacking LXRα, reduced in cells lacking LXRβ, and essentially lost in LXRαβ double knockout cells. VEGF expression appears to be somewhat more sensitive to loss of LXRβ expression than the established LXR target genes Abca1 and Abcg1, because induction of Abca1 and Abcg1 is reduced only in double knockout cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Nevertheless it is clear that both LXRα and LXRβ are competent to mediate ligand induction of VEGF expression in macrophages. We next investigated the possibility that the Vegfa gene was a direct transcriptional target of LXR/RXR heterodimers. Sequence analysis of the human and murine VEGF promoters led to the identification of a conserved DR-4-like motif located downstream of the hypoxia response element (Fig. 4A, HRE). In vitro expressed LXRs bound to this element in a heterodimeric complex with RXRα as revealed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 4B and data not shown). The previously identified LXR response element from the human LXRα gene served as a control. The complex formed on the VEGF-derived LXRE was sequence-specific, as judged by the ability of an excess of unlabeled murine or human VEGF LXRE to compete for its formation (Fig. 4C). In contrast, oligonucleotides carrying point mutations in the LXRE (indicated schematically in Fig. 4A) did not compete (Fig. 4D). To investigate whether the LXRE in the VEGF promoter was functional, we constructed a luciferase reporter containing sequences from –984 to +1 of the human VEGF promoter. Fig. 5 demonstrates that cotransfection of the hVEGF-luc reporter into HepG2 cells along with expression vectors for LXRα/RXR led to a ligand-dependent increase in reporter activity. Similar results were obtained when an LXRβ expression vector was used. Mutation of the previously identified hypoxia response element in the hVEGF promoter had minimal effect on the LXR-dependent induction (Fig. 5, HRE mut), indicating that the effects of LXR are independent of HIF-1α. In contrast, mutation of the LXRE in the promoter completely abolished the response to LXRα and LXRβ (Fig. 5, LXRE mut). The activity of the double mutant construct (Fig. 5, DBL mut) was not different from that of the LXRE mutant. Taken together, the results of Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrate that the VEGF promoter is a direct target for regulation by LXR and that LXR regulation is independent of the hypoxia response element. Hypoxia is a key physiologic regulator of VEGF expression. We therefore investigated the ability of LXR ligands to modulate VEGF expression under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. As expected, incubation of murine peritoneal macrophages under conditions of low oxygen tension (1% O2) led to a strong induction in VEGF mRNA compared with normoxia (21% O2) (Fig. 6A). Treatment of the cells with LXR agonist further induced VEGF expression under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. These observations suggest that the regulation of VEGF expression by LXRs is additive to that of the hypoxia response pathway. Macrophage expression of VEGF has also been reported to be responsive to various inflammatory stimuli (18Itaya H. Imaizumi T. Yoshida H. Koyama M. Suzuki S. Satoh K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Treatment of macrophages with LPS stimulates the expression of numerous inflammatory genes including iNOS (Fig. 6B). Consistent with previous work, treatment of peritoneal macrophages with the LXR agonist, GW3965, inhibited LPS-induced iNOS expression. The pattern of VEGF expression following treatment with inflammatory stimuli and LXR ligand, however, is distinct from that of iNOS and other highly NFκB-responsive inflammatory genes. LXR ligand induces VEGF expression, although repressing iNOS expression in the same cell (Fig. 6, B and C). LPS alone is a very weak inducer of VEGF expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages; however, the effect of LPS is strongly enhanced by co-treatment with the adenosine A2A receptor agonist NECA (Fig. 6C) (21Leibovich S.J. Chen J.-F. Pinhal-Enfield G. Belem P.C. Elson G. Rosania A. Ramanathan M. Montesinos C. Jacobson M. Schwarzschild M.A. Fink J.S. Cronstein B. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 2231-2244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although the induction by LXR ligands is lost in LXR-deficient macrophages (Fig. 3), both wild type and LXR null cells are equally responsive to a combined treatment with low doses of LPS and NECA. Thus, the induction of Vegfa gene expression by these inflammatory stimuli is independent of LXR. Finally, we endeavored to address whether expression of VEGF could be modulated by LXR agonists in vivo. Because adipose tissue is highly vascularized and it has been shown previously to express VEGF in a differentiation-dependent manner and because both LXRα and LXRβ are expressed in fat, we examined the ability of LXR ligand to regulate VEGF expression in adipose tissue. C57BL/6 mice (8 animals/group) were treated for 3 days with 20 mg/kg of the synthetic LXR agonist, GW3965. As shown in Fig. 7, treatment with LXR agonist led to a modest but significant increase (p < 0.05) in adipose tissue VEGF expression. These results indicate that VEGF is an LXR-responsive gene both in vitro and in vivo. VEGF is primarily known as an inducer of angiogenesis, but this cytokine also has roles in vascular permeability and hematopoietic cell development and differentiation (33Dvorak H.F. Nagy J.A. Feng D. Brown L.F. Dvorak A.M. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 237: 97-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). VEGF is important in both inflammation and repair and is critical for the resolution of injury and the process of wound healing. Macrophages are a major source of VEGF in wound healing, chronic inflammation, and cancer (34Flamme I. Frolich T. Risau W. J. Cell.

VEGF mRNA expression in murine peritoneal macrophages was potently induced (up to 18-fold) by combined treatment with synthetic agonists for LXR and RXR. We further showed that LXR/RXR heterodimers bound to and activated a conserved element in the VEGF promoter. Finally, the ability of LXR agonists to regulate VEGF expression was compromised in macrophages derived from LXRβ or LXRαβ null mice. These observations suggest that the LXR signaling pathway may modulate VEGF expression in response to lipid mediators in settings of inflammation and repair. In macrophages, uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein results in an increased cellular concentration of oxidative derivatives of cholesterol. Activation of LXR by such compounds has been shown to lead to the induction of target genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport such as Abca1, Abcg1 and apoE (26Laffitte B.A. Repa J.J.

Previous studies from several authors suggest that VEGF expression in macrophages is regulated by components of oxidized low density lipoprotein, which are ligands for the nuclear receptor PPARγ (40Bamba H. Ota S. Kato A. Kawamoto C. Fujiwara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 41Jozkowicz A. Dulak J. Piatkowska E. Placha W. Dembinska-Kiec A.

However, these studies employed high concentrations of compounds that are rather poor PPARγ agonists, such as 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 and ciglitazone. It is now recognized that these agents also target other pathways because many of their effects are preserved in PPARγ-deficient cells (43Chawla A. Barak Y. Nagy L. Liao D. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). In our hands, none of the highly selective PPAR agonists altered expression of VEGF when used at appropriate concentrations in mouse or human macrophages (Fig. 2). Because reduced oxygen tension is a major physiologic signal for induction of VEGF expression, we investigated whether LXR could contribute to VEGF induction under hypoxic conditions. VEGF expression was increased by LXR agonists under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and the LXR effect was additive to the HIF-1-dependent pathway. Similarly, VEGF induction, by inflammatory signals such as LPS and the purinergic receptor agonist NECA, is also independent of LXR as it occurs to the same extent in both wild type and LXR-deficient macrophages (Fig. 5). We have also demonstrated that LXR agonist administration results in a significant increase in VEGF mRNA expression in the white adipose tissue in mice. Thus, the LXR pathway may impact VEGF expression in other cell types as well. The physiological relevance of LXR-dependent VEGF regulation is not clear at present. It is unlikely that the LXR pathway is a primary regulator of angiogenesis, because LXR null mice show no obvious defects in vascularization. 2R. Walczak, S. B. Joseph, B. A. Laffitte, A. Castrillo, L. Pei, and P. Tontonoz, unpublished observations. However, it is possible that activation of LXR in macrophages in contexts such as inflammation or wound healing may be important for modulation of VEGF activity. Recently, we demonstrated that in addition to controlling genes involved in lipid metabolism, LXR negatively regulates a number of inflammatory pathways in macrophages. Treatment of murine macrophages with LXR ligands inhibits the expression of numerous NFκB target genes, such as TNFα, iNOS, and COX-2 (30Joseph S.B. Castrillo A. Laffitte B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, VEGF does not follow this same pattern. VEGF mRNA expression is up-regulated by LXR agonists both in the presence and absence of LPS. Although VEGF has been reported to be responsive to NFκB activation (19Xiong M. Elson G. Legarda D. Leibovich S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Kiriakidis S. Andreakos E. Monaco C. Foxwell B. Feldmann M. Paleolog E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), it is also regulated by many other pathways. Unlike iNOS, VEGF expression in murine macrophages is not highly dependent on NFκB (Fig. 6). The unique response of VEGF compared with other inflammatory genes is most likely explained by the observation that it is a direct target for regulation by LXR. How do these observations relate to recent work on the functions of LXRs in atherosclerosis? In addition to its angiogenic activity, VEGF has been shown to regulate the survival and maturation of hematopoietic stem cells and to increase the mobilization of myeloid cells from bone marrow into the circulation. VEGF has also been shown to enhance recruitment of inflammatory cells into atherosclerotic lesions (44Celletti F.L. Waugh J.M. Amabile P.G. Brendolan A. Hilfiker P.R. Dake M.D. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 425-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Recent studies have implicated VEGF in plaque neovascularization and plaque progression (45Moulton K.S. Vakili K. Zurakowski D. Soliman M. Butterfield C. Sylvin E. Lo K.-M. Gillies S. Javaherian K. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). However, targeted suppression of VEGF signaling by blocking antibodies for either Flt-1 or Flk-1 showed very little effect on angiogenesis in atherosclerotic lesions (46Luttun A. Tjwa M. Moons L. Wu Y. Angelillo-Scherrer A. Liao F. Nagy J.A. Hooper A. Priller J. De Klerck B. Compernolle V. Daci E. Bohlen P. Dewerchin M. Herbert J.M. Fava R. Matthys P. Carmeliet G. Collen D. Dvorak H.F. Hicklin D.J. Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Macrophages play both positive and negative roles in the context of the atherosclerotic lesion. The scavenging of oxidized lipids and the removal of cholesterol through reverse cholesterol transport is beneficial. However, once overwhelmed by their lipid load, macrophages elaborate inflammatory mediators, induce smooth muscle cell proliferation, and contribute to plaque instability through production of matrix metalloproteinases. Although the regulation of VEGF expression by LXR in macrophages might be predicted to be proatherogenic, it is well established that the net effect of LXR activation is anti-atherogenic. Synthetic LXR agonists reduce lesion formation in murine models of atherosclerosis (47Joseph S.B. McKilligin E. Pei L. Watson M.A. Collins A.R. Laffitte B.A. Chen M. Noh G. Goodman J. Hagger G.N. Tran J. Tippin T.K. Wang X. Lusis A.J. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Collins J.L. Willson T.M. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2002; 99: 11896-11901Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). LXR activation also inhibits basal and cytokine-inducible expression of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9), which is expressed in its active form in atherosclerotic lesions and is believed to play an important role in vascular remodeling and plaque instability (49Castrillo A.

https://openalex.org/W2063106228,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel in the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. Like other ABC transporters, it can hydrolyze ATP. Yet while ATP hydrolysis influences channel gating, it has long seemed puzzling that CFTR would require this reaction because anions flow passively through CFTR. Moreover, no other ion channel is known to require the large energy of ATP hydrolysis to gate. We found that CFTR also has adenylate kinase activity (ATP + AMP ←⃗ ADP + ADP) that regulates gating. When functioning as an adenylate kinase, CFTR showed positive cooperativity for ATP suggesting its two nucleotide binding domains may dimerize. Thus, channel activity could be regulated by two different enzymatic reactions, ATPase and adenylate kinase, that share a common ATP binding site in the second nucleotide binding domain. At physiologic nucleotide concentrations, adenylate kinase activity, rather than ATPase activity may control gating, and therefore involve little energy consumption."

Flaviviral NS5 contains conserved motifs found in several 5′-RNA methyltransferases at its N-terminal region (35Koonin E.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 36Rozanov M.N. Koonin E.V. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2129-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the N-terminal region consisting of 296 amino acid residues of DEN2 NS5 containing the guanylyltransferase/methyltransferase domain was recently reported (37Egloff M.P.

This domain can catalyze the transfer of methyl group from the S-adenosylmethionine to form the 2′-O-methyladenine but no 7-methylguanosine was formed. The C-terminal region of the flaviviral NS5 contains conserved motifs consistent with those of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP) encoded by several positive-strand RNA viruses (38Poch O. Sauvaget I. Delarue M. Tordo N. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3867-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 39O'Reilly E.K. Kao C.C. Virology. 1998; 252: 287-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this study, we expressed the WNV NS5 (from the EG101 strain) with an N-terminal His tag in Escherichia coli and purified the protein using metal affinity chromatography and characterized the biochemical properties of the polymerase in RNA synthesis. An in vitro viral RdRP assay system for DEN2 was reported that was dependent on addition of exogenous subgenomic viral RNA (+)-strand templates containing conserved sequence motifs within the 5′- and 3′-TR and purified polymerase in the presence of four nucleoside triphosphatase (40Ackermann M. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39926-39937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Two RNA products were formed, a template-sized product and a hairpin product, twice the size of the template RNA. The template-sized RNA (1×) was shown to be double-stranded in nature by its resistance to RNase A digestion under high ionic strength conditions, and it was formed as a result of de novo synthesis from the input (+)-strand RNA (40Ackermann M. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39926-39937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The hairpin RNA (2×) was formed by 3′-end elongation of the template RNA by a “copy-back” mechanism. RNase A digestion of the hairpin RNA also gave rise to a template-sized product upon digestion of the single-stranded “fold-back” region. In this study, we describe the first in vitro RdRP assay for WNV that utilizes purified NS5 and exogenous subgenomic WNV RNA templates of either (+)- or (–)-strand polarity; the 5′-end of template RNAs was either triphosphorylated or had a 5′-cap structure. We show that whereas the uncapped (+)- strand RNA template produced both hairpin RNA and the template-sized de novo synthesized RNA, addition of 5′-cap on the subgenomic (+)-strand RNA template reduced the formation of hairpin RNA by 48% without affecting the synthesis of the de novo product RNA. The newly synthesized RNA from the (+)-strand template RNA was of (–)-strand polarity as determined by RNase H mapping. Moreover, we show that the WNV NS5 could also utilize uncapped or 5′-capped subgenomic WNV (–)-strand templates to produce predominantly de novo product that are of (+)-strand polarity. Finally, mutational analysis of the 5′- and 3′-CYC motifs in both subgenomic WNV (+)- and (–)-strand templates showed that these motifs play a critical role in (–)-strand synthesis from (+)-strand RNA templates but do not seem to affect the (+)-strand synthesis from (–)- strand templates. The sequences corresponding to the WNV NS5 were PCR amplified from the plasmid containing the full-length WNV EG101 strain genome (NCBI number AF260968) using the following primers: the forward primer, 5′-TCCCCCGGGTGGGCAAAGGGACGCACCTTG-3′ and the reverse primer, 5′-TCCCCCGGGTTACAGTACTGTGTCCTCAACC-3′. The product from this PCR was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and the sequence was verified. The positive clone was digested with XmaI (underlined) and the fragment was cloned into pQE30 vector (Qiagen), giving rise to pQE30-WNV NS5. For the bacterial expression of WNV NS5, E. coli Top10 F′ cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with pQE30-WNV NS5 plasmid. Transformed E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.5% (w/v) glucose to an A600 nm of 0.6–0.8. Cells were collected by centrifugation (5000 × g) to remove the glucose from the medium, the pellet was resuspended in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma), and incubated for 48 h at 18 °C. Bacteria were then collected by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. For purification of WNV NS5, bacteria were resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol and were lysed by using a French press. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a Talon column (Clontech). WNV NS5 proteins were eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The peak fractions containing the WNV NS5 protein were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 40% glycerol. The purified protein was stored at –20 °C. cDNA Constructs Encoding Subgenomic RNA Containing the 5′- and 3′-TR of WNV Genome—A 281-nt DNA fragment from the 5′-TR that includes the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) (96 nt) and the 5′ cyclization motif (CYC, which corresponds to 137–144 nt of the viral genome) was generated by PCR using WNV EG101 plasmid as a template and the forward primer, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGAGTAGTTCGCCTGTGTGAGCTGAC-3′ (T7 promoter (underlined) was fused to 1–24 nt of the viral genome) and the reverse primer, 5′-CACTGCTCGGGTCGGAGCAAT-3′ (complementary to 271–291 nt of the viral genome containing the authentic AvaI site (underlined)). An amplified PCR product, WNV5′TR281nt, was cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (pGEM-T easy-WNV5′TR). The 3′-TR (770 nt) that includes the 3′-UTR (631 nt) was amplified using WNV EG101 plasmid as a template and the forward primer, 5′-CACAAGAACCCGAGCCACG-3′ (corresponding to 10251–10269 nt of the viral genome containing the authentic AvaI site (underlined)) and the reverse primer, 5′-GCTCTAGAAGATCCTGTGTTCTCGCACCA-3′ (complementary to 11009–11029 nt fused with the XbaI site (underlined)). The plasmid DNA, pGEM-T easy-WNV3′TR, was obtained by cloning of 3′TR770nt into the pGEM-T easy vector. The sequences of the 5′- and 3′-TR cDNAs in the pGEM-T easy plasmids were verified. The 5′- and 3′-TR encoding fragments were obtained by digestion of the pGEM-T easy plasmids with AvaI and EcoRI (in the vector) and AvaI and XbaI, respectively, and cloned into EcoRI- and XbaI-digested pSP64 vector (Promega) to yield the plasmid, pSP64-WNV1051nt encoding the WNV subgenomic RNA (Fig. 2). Plasmids Containing Mutant Cyclization Motif (mutCYC)—pSP64-WNV1051nt containing mutCYC motif was obtained using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primers used in the mutagenesis reaction were the following. For the 5′ mutCYC, the 5′-CCGGCAAGAGCCGGGCTGCCTGCAGGCTAAAACGCGGAATGCCC-3′ and its complement as primers, and for the 3′ mutCYC, the 5′-CACCACAACAAAACAGCCTGCAGGCACCTGGGATAGACTAGGAG-3′ and its complement as primers were used for PCR. The underlined sequence indicates the replacement of the wild type CYC sequence (wtCYC), TCAATATG, with the mutCYC sequence, CCTGCAGG. The plasmid containing both 5′- and 3′-mutCYC motifs was obtained by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using primers containing 3′ mutCYC sequences and the plasmid containing the 5′ mut-CYC motif as the template (see above). PCR Products Encoding Subgenomic WNV (+)-Strand RNA1051nt (wt and mutCYC)—To generate the subgenomic WNV (+)RNA1051nt containing wild type as well as mutCYC motifs, PCR was performed using the appropriate plasmid as the template (Fig. 2) and two primers for PCR as follows: the forward primer, 5′-AGCTATGACCATGATTACGAATTC-3′ (pSP64-EcoRI primer) that corresponds to the sequences upstream of the T7 promoter and the reverse primer, 5′-AGATCCTGTGTTCTCGCACCAC-3′ (WNV-3′ end primer) that anneals with the 3′ end region of the WNV 3′-UTR. PCR Products Encoding Subgenomic Wild Type and CYC Mutant WNV (–)-Strand RNA1051nt—The first PCR was carried out with the same plasmid construct as above as a template and two primers: the forward primer, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGAGATCCTGTGTTCTCGCACCAC-3′ that contains T7 promoter (underlined) fused with the 5′-end of WNV (–)-strand, and the reverse primer, 5′-AGTAGTTCGCCTGTGTGAGCTGAC-3′ (WNV-5′UTR (+)-strand primer). A second PCR was carried out with the forward primer containing the T7 promoter, 5′-TTACGAATTCGAGCTCGCCCTAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′ and the same reverse primer consisting of the WNV-5′UTR (+)-strand sequence used for the first PCR. PCR Product Encoding the WNV (+)-Strand 5′TR230nt RNA—PCR was performed with the pSP64-WNV1051nt as the template and two primers: pSP64 (EcoRI) primer as the forward primer and the reverse primer, 5′-CGTATTGGTCCCTTGCCGTCGATC-3′ that corresponds to the sequence complementary to 207–230 nt of the WNV genome. PCR Product Encoding the WNV (+)-Strand 3′-UTR631nt RNA—To generate the WNV(+) 3′-UTR631nt RNA, the first PCR was carried out with pSP64-WNV1051nt as the template and two primers: the forward primer, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGATACTTTATTAATTGTAAATAGAC-3′ that contains the T7 promoter (underlined) fused with the 5′ terminal sequence of the 3′-UTR, and the sequence complementary to the WNV-3′ end as the reverse primer. The second PCR was performed using the same forward primer containing the T7 promoter used in the second PCR described above and the reverse primer consisting of the sequence complementary to the 3′-end of WNV (–)-strand was the same as that used in the first PCR. To generate WNV (–)-strand 3′-TR230nt RNA, the first PCR was carried out with pSP64-WNV1051nt as the template and the two following primers: the forward primer, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGCGTATTGGTCCCTTGCCGTCGATC-3′ that contains the T7 promoter (underlined) fused with the sequence complementary to 207–230 nt of the viral genome, and the reverse primer sequence from the beginning of the WNV (+)-strand 5′-UTR. The second PCR was performed as described the above. All PCR were performed with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) using the appropriate template and primers. The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and was used in the in vitro transcription reaction. In vitro transcription was performed with Ampliscribe™ T7 Transcription kit (Epicenter Technologies) as described by the manufacturer using the T7 promoter containing PCR products prepared as described above or using linearized plasmid DNAs (pTM1 vector plasmid digested with BamHI or pSP64 digested with AflIII). In the case of PCR product or linearized plasmid containing SP6 promoter, the Ampliscribe™ SP6 Transcription kit (Epicenter Technologies) was used as described by the manufacturer. 5′-Capped RNAs were prepared using AmpliCap™ T7 High Yield Message Maker kit (Epicenter Technologies) as described by the manufacturer. The RNA transcripts were purified as described previously (41You S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33714-33722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and then used in the RdRP assays. RNA templates with blocked 3′-OH groups were prepared using 3′-dATP (TriLink BioTechnologies) and poly(A) polymerase (Ambion) as described by Luo et al. (42Luo G. Hamatake R.K. Mathis D.M. Racela J. Rigat K.L. Lemm J. Colonno R.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The in vitro RdRP assays were carried out as described previously (40Ackermann M. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39926-39937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) except when indicated. Briefly, the reaction mixture (50 μm) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, template RNA (0.3 μg), 500 μm each of ATP, GTP, and UTP, 10 μm unlabeled CTP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP along with 270 ng of purified WNV NS5 (2.6 pmol). The incubation was carried out at 25 °C, which favored de novo synthesis of RNA over 3′-end elongation (40Ackermann M. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39926-39937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). When the specificity of the RdRP was analyzed using various nonspecific RNA templates, the incubation temperature of the RdRP reaction was 30 °C at which the total RNA synthesis was higher than at 25 °C. Following extraction with acid phenol/chloroform, the reaction mixture was passed through a P30 gel filtration column (Bio-Rad) to remove the unincorporated nucleotides. RNA was then analyzed by formaldehydeagarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. When indicated, the labeled bands were excised from dried gels and quantified by liquid scintillation counting and density analysis using the imagej program, a free software product available at the National Institutes of Health website. 2rsb.info.nih.gov/ij. The amount of template RNA, NS5, and incubation time for the RdRP assays were chosen from the linear range of RNA synthesis. The hairpin and the de novo products produced in the RdRP assays were either analyzed directly by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis or (in the case of wild type and mutCYC (+)-strand RNA templates in the RdRP assays) were first analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE; 5%) followed by autoradiography. The bands containing the RNA products were cut out, eluted from the gel (elution buffer: 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA and 0.1% SDS), and precipitated with ethanol. The RNA products were further analyzed by formaldehyde-agarose gel, followed by autoradiography as described previously (41You S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33714-33722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To analyze the RdRP products, RNase A digestion was performed as described previously (41You S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33714-33722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, RdRP products were distributed equally and treated with or without RNase A (Sigma; 200 ng) in 20 μl of 2× SSC at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 30 μl of TES stop buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.2% SDS), followed by acid phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation in the presence of 10 μg of yeast tRNA (Ambion). The RNase A-treated products were analyzed on formaldehyde-agarose gel followed by autoradiography. RNase H mapping was carried out essentially as reported previously (42Luo G. Hamatake R.K. Mathis D.M. Racela J. Rigat K.L. Lemm J. Colonno R.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 43Behrens S.E. Tomei L. De Francesco R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Following the RdRP assay using either WNV (+)RNA1051nt or WNV (–)RNA1051nt template, RNase A treatment was carried out only for RdRP products synthesized from the WNV (+)RNA1051nt template to digest the single-stranded loop region of the 2× hairpin product. After RNase A treatment, the reaction mixture was digested with proteinase K (Sigma; 40 μg) followed by extraction with acid phenol/chloroform and precipitation with ethanol. The RdRP products were then mixed with 1.5 μg of either WNV (+)RNA1051nt or WNV (–)RNA1051nt that was complementary to the template used in the RdRP reaction, denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and reannealed in a hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl) at 42 °C overnight. RNA samples were then precipitated with ethanol and resuspended with 20 μl of RNase H mapping buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 units of RNasin (Promega), 4 units of RNase H (Thermostable; Epicenter Technologies), 200 μm oligodeoxynucleotide of either (+)- or (–)-strand polarity). The reaction mixture was incubated at 45 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by addition of 2× stop buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS). RNA was extracted with acid phenol/chloroform, then precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed by formaldehyde-agarose gel. Purification of Full-length WNV NS5—We found that E. coli TOP10F′ cells transformed by WNV NS5 yielded higher amounts of NS5 protein in the soluble form compared with E. coli XL1-BLUE, which was used for DEN2 NS5. Moreover, addition of glucose (0.5%) to the LB growth medium during the initial phase of E. coli growth was necessary as observed for E. coli XL1-BLUE transformed by DEN2 NS5 plasmid presumably because of toxicity of the leaky expression of the NS5 protein from the lac promoter (40Ackermann M. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39926-39937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) (data not shown). After the growth of E. coli cells reached A600 nm of 0.6–0.8, glucose was removed and expression of WNV NS5 was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and the bacterial culture was incubated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The NS5 protein, subsequent to elution from the metal affinity (Talon™ resin) column and dialysis, was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8%) and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1). The NS5 protein purified in this manner had some minor contaminants and its purity was estimated to be 80% by density analysis. The purified WNV NS5 protein was free of any RNase contamination as judged from the results of incubation with the subgenomic WNV (+)RNA1051nt template at 37 °C for 2 h followed by analysis by electrophoresis on a 4% acrylamide, 8 m urea PAGE gel and staining with ethidium bromide. No contamination of any RNase was detected (data not shown). Therefore, this WNV NS5 protein was used for subsequent experiments (described below). RdRP Assay Using WNV Subgenomic RNA Templates— First, we determined whether the purified WNV NS5 was enzymatically active in RNA synthesis on the WNV (+)RNA1051nt as the template used in the RdRP assay. This template RNA contains the authentic regulatory elements within 5′- and 3′-TRs including the two self-complementary 9-nucleotide long CYC motifs located within the 5′- and 3′-conserved sequence elements reported previously (11Hahn C.S. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Lee E. Dalgarno L. Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2B). RdRP assay was carried out in a reaction mixture containing the four NTPs in which the α-32P-labeled CTP was included along with the template RNA and the purified NS5 polymerase. The RNA products synthesized in the reaction were analyzed by a formaldehyde-agarose gel followed by autoradiography. In this in vitro a"

However, the impact of these proteins on the transcriptional activity of natural estrogens or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) has not been determined. Here we show that AIB1-Delta3 causes a significant increase in the efficacy of 17beta-estradiol at both estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) and ER-beta in ovarian, breast and endometrial cancer cell lines. AIB1-Delta3 also significantly increased the efficacy of the natural estrogen genistein at both ER-alpha and ER-beta, whereas AIB1 had no effect on either the potency or efficacy of genistein at either receptor. The estrogenic efficacy of the partial agonist tamoxifen was significantly increased in all cell lines at ER-alpha by overexpression of AIB1-Delta3 both on transfected and endogenous estrogen responsive genes. In contrast, overexpression of AIB1 or AIB1-Delta3 had no effect on the potency or efficacy of the SERM raloxifene. We conclude that overexpression of the AIB1-Delta3 isoform will increase the estrogenicity of a variety of natural and pharmacologic compounds in tissues that develop hormone-dependent neoplasias and overexpression of these cofactors may be a contributing factor to the hormone-driven development of neoplasia and to antiestrogen resistance of breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1997741611,"Gene amplification is common in solid tumors and is associated with adverse prognosis, disease progression, and development of drug resistance. A small segment from chromosome 17q11-12 containing the HER-2/Neu gene is amplified in about 25% of breast cancer. HER-2/Neu amplification is associated with adverse prognosis and may predict response to chemotherapy and hormonal manipulation. Moreover, HER-2/Neu amplification may select patients for anti-HER-2/Neu-based therapy with Herceptin. We and others recently described a common sequence element from the HER-2/Neu region that was amplified in breast cancer cells. In addition, most, if not all, of the amplified genes from this region display overexpression. This raises the intriguing possibility that genes immediately adjacent to HER-2/Neu may influence the biological behavior of breast cancer carrying HER-2/Neu amplification and serve as rational targets for therapy. By extracting sequence information from public databases, we have constructed a contig in bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) that extends from HER-2/Neu to a phosphotidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPK), Pip4k2beta from 17q11-12. Although a role of PI-3-kinase and AKT in cancer biology has been previously described, PIPK has not been previously implicated. We show that Pip4k2beta, initially known as Pip5k2beta, is amplified in a subset of breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancer samples that carry HER-2/Neu amplification. Out of eight breast cancer cell lines with HER-2/Neu amplification, three have concomitant amplification of the Pip4k2beta gene--UACC-812, BT-474 and ZR-75-30. Similarly, two out of four primary breast tumors with HER-2/Neu amplification carry Pip4k2beta gene amplification. Intriguingly, one tumor displays an increase in the gene copy number of Pip4k2beta that is significantly more than that of HER-2/Neu. Moreover, dual color FISH reveals that amplified Pip4k2beta gene may exist in a distinct structure from that of HER-2/Neu in ZR-75-30 cell line. These studies suggest that Pip4k2beta may reside on an amplification maximum distinct from that of HER-2/Neu and serve as an independent target for amplification and selective retention. Pip4k2beta amplification is associated with overexpression at the RNA and protein level in breast cancer cell lines. Stable expression of Pip4k2beta in breast cancer cell lines with and without HER-2/Neu amplification increases cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. The above observations implicate Pip4k2beta in the development and/or progression of breast cancer. Our study suggests that Pip4k2beta may be a distinct target for gene amplification and selective retention from 17q11-12."

https://openalex.org/W1996010382,"Imperatoxin A is a high affinity activator of ryanodine receptors. The toxin contains a positively charged surface structure similar to that of the A fragment of skeletal dihydropyridine receptors (peptide A), suggesting that the toxin and peptide could bind to a common site on the ryanodine receptor. However, the question of a common binding site has not been resolved, and the concentration dependence of the actions of the toxin has not been fully explored. We characterize two novel high affinity actions of the toxin on the transient gating of cardiac and skeletal channels, in addition to the well documented lower affinity induction of prolonged substates. Transient activity was (a) enhanced with 0.2-10 nm toxin and (b) depressed by >50 nm toxin. The toxin at ≥1 nm enhanced Ca2+ release from SR in a manner consistent with two independent activation processes. The effects of the toxin on transient activity, as well as the toxin-induced substate, were independent of cytoplasmic Ca2+ or Mg2+ concentrations or the presence of adenine nucleotide and were seen in diisothiocyanostilbene-2′,2′-disulfonic acid-modified channels. Peptide A activated skeletal and cardiac channels with 100 nm cytoplasmic Ca2+ and competed with Imperatoxin A in the high affinity enhancement of transient channel activity and Ca2+ release from SR. In contrast to transient activity, prolonged substate openings induced by the toxin were not altered in the presence of peptide A.

A protein-protein interaction between the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and ryanodine receptor (RyR) underlies EC coupling in skeletal muscle. The DHPR L-type Ca2+ channel in the t-tubule membrane detects surface depolarization and transmits a signal to the RyR channel in the SR via an interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of the two proteins. The interacting region of the DHPR is located between the second and third transmembrane repeats in the α1 subunit (II-III loop) (1Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S.

The ability of peptide A to activate RyRs is highly correlated with its capacity to adopt an α-helical structure (15Casarotto M.G. Gibson F. Pace S.M. Curtis S.M. Mulcair M. Dulhunty A.F. J. Biol.

Lamb G.D. Dulhunty A.F. Casarotto M.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Curiously, two scorpion toxins, Imperatoxin A and Maurocalcine (having 82% sequence identity), have structural features in common with peptide A. Although the intrinsically disulfide-stabilized β-sheet structure of the toxins is vastly different from the α-helical structure of the A peptide, the toxins and peptide A share a similar surface orientation of positively charged residues (18Green D.

Because of this structural similarity, several studies have examined the possibility that the scorpion toxins and peptide A bind to the same site on RyR1. Two studies have concluded that they bind to the same, or overlapping sites (13Gurrola G.B. Arevalo C. Sreekumar R. Lokuta A.J. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7879-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Green D. Pace S. Curtis S.M. Sakowska M. Lamb G.D. Dulhunty A.F. Casarotto M.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas a third study concluded that Maurocalcine/Imperatoxin A and peptide A bind to independent sites (19Chen L. Esteve E.

These different conclusions could have arisen if more than one binding site exists for either the toxins and for peptide A, and not all sites are common to the two compounds. At least two binding sites for peptide A have been defined, one within the channel pore, which leads to voltage-dependent channel block (12Dulhunty A.F. Laver D.R. Gallant E.M. Casarotto M.G. Pace S.M. Curtis S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 189-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and a site (or sites) on the cytoplasmic domain of the channel, which support its voltage-independent actions (10Stange M. Tripathy A. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1419-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Dulhunty A.F. Laver D.R. Gallant E.M. Casarotto M.G. Pace S.M. Curtis S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 189-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the possibility that Imperatoxin A also has multiple actions on RyR activity and examine interactions of between the toxin and peptide A in modifying RyR channel gating. We find that there are a least three separate effects of Imperatoxin A on cardiac and skeletal RyR channels that can be distinguished by their affinity and reversibility and by their ability to compete with peptide A in its native and a modified form. The results show that peptide A competes with Imperatoxin A for the high affinity activation of transient channel openings. On the other hand, peptide A does not prevent the characteristic toxin-induced prolonged substate activity. The results suggest that there is at least one common or overlapping binding site for Imperatoxin A and peptide A as well as independent binding sites. These observations raise the questions of which of the Imperatoxin A binding sites has been identified on the RyR (21Samso M. Trujillo R. Gurrola G.B. Valdivia H.H. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and whether this site is the site that also interacts with peptide A. Peptides—Peptides A and A1(D-R18) were synthesized as in Green et al. (18Green D. Pace S. Curtis S.M. Sakowska M. Lamb G.D. Dulhunty A.F. Casarotto M.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Imperatoxin A was synthesized by Auspep Australia and folded using procedures outlined by Fajloun et al. (22Fajloun Z. Kharrat R. Chen L. Lecomte C. Di Luccio E. Bichet D. El Ayeb M. Rochat H. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) Vesicle Preparation—Preparation of SR vesicles, Ca2+ release from SR, and single channel techniques have been described previously. Heavy skeletal SR vesicles were prepared from rabbit back and leg muscle (11Haarmann C.C. Green D. Casarotto M.G. Laver D.R. Dulhunty A.F. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Dulhunty A.F. Laver D.R. Gallant E.M. Casarotto M.G. Pace S.M. Curtis S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 189-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas cardiac SR vesicles were prepared from sheep heart (23Laver D.R. Roden L.D. Ahern G.P. Eager K.R. Junankar P.R. Dulhunty A.F. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 147: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Single Channel Techniques—Bilayers of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine (5:3:2 w/w) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were formed across an aperture of ∼200-μm diameter in the wall of a 1.0-ml Delrin cup (Cadillac Plastics, Australia). Terminal cisternae vesicles (10 μg/ml) were added to the cis chamber. The cytoplasmic side of channels incorporated into the bilayer faced the cis solution. Bilayer potential was controlled, and single channel currents were recorded, using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Bilayer potential is expressed as Vcis - Vtrans (Vcytoplasm - Vlumen). Bilayers were formed and vesicles incorporated using cis solutions containing (in millimolar): 230 CsCH3O3S/20 CsCl/5.0 CaCl2/10 TES/500 mm mannitol (pH 7.4) with CsOH and a trans solution containing (in millimolar) 30 CsMS/20 CsCl/1 CaCl2/10 TES (pH 7.4). Following incorporation, (a) the cis solution was replaced with an identical solution, except that the [Ca2+] was between 0.1 and 100 μm and (b) 200 mm CsCH3O3S was added to the trans chamber for symmetry. Drugs were added to the cis chamber and removed by perfusion with 10 ml of cis solution. Analysis of Channel Activity—Channel activity was analyzed over one to two 30-s periods of continuous activity at +40 mV and then at -40 mV. Slow fluctuations in the baseline were corrected using an in-house baseline correction program (written by Dr. D. R. Laver). Channel activity was measured either as “mean current” (the average of all data points in a record) or as open probability (Po), using a threshold analysis with the program Channel 2, (developed by P. W. Gage and M. Smith, John Curtin School of Medical Research). Measurements of mean current, performed on records from experiments containing 1-4 channels, included all channel activity from the smallest subconductance level to maximum openings. On the other hand, open probability (Po), mean open time (To), and mean closed time (Tc) measurements are restricted to records in which the opening of a single channel only could be detected and exclude openings that fall within the baseline noise. In this case threshold levels for channel opening and closing were set to exclude baseline noise (a) at ∼20% of the maximum single channel conductance when examining transient openings in the absence of prolonged substates or (b) at 50% of the maximum conductance or 50% of the substate level to measure Po of maximum or substate conductance respectively, when substates were present. Channel activity is expressed as relative Po to include data in which activity varied from ∼0.0001 to ∼0.1 and data from bilayers containing more than one channel. Relative Po was calculated either (a) from I′t/I′c, where I′t is the mean current under test conditions and I′c is the control mean current, or (b) from Pot/Poc, where Pot is the open probability under test conditions and Poc the control open probability. Because the mean current divided by the maximum current approximates open probability, I′t/I′c ≡ Pot/Poc. DIDS Modification—Channels modified by the disulfinic stilbene derivative, diisothiocyanostilbene-2′,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS), were used in some cases with a cytoplasmic [Ca2+] of 100 nm to enhance channel activity under control conditions. DIDS modification does not alter the regulation of RyRs by Mg2+, ryanodine, or ruthenium red (24Oba T. Koshita M. Van Helden D.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C819-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although it can interact with other properties of RyRs (25Hill A.P. Sitsapesan R. Biophys.

Channels were exposed to 100 or 300 μm DIDS in the cis chamber for 4-6 min, and then DIDS was removed by perfusion. Activity increased in the presence of DIDS and then fell with removal of the reversible component of activation. However, activity remained higher than before exposure to DIDS because of covalent bonds formed between isothiocyanate groups and NH2, OH, and aromatic groups on a variety of amino acid residues (28O'Neill E.R. Sakowska M.M. Laver D.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1674-1689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ca2+ Release from SR—Extravesicular Ca2+ was monitored at 710 nm using a Cary 3 spectrophotometer (12Dulhunty A.F. Laver D.R. Gallant E.M. Casarotto M.G. Pace S.M. Curtis S. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 189-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cuvette solution was stirred continuously, and temperature was controlled at 25 °C. Skeletal SR (100 μg of protein) was added to the cuvette solution (final volume of 2 ml), containing (in millimolar): 100 KH2PO4 (pH 7); 4 MgCl2; 1 Na2ATP; 0.5 antipyrylazo III. Ca2+,Mg2+-ATPase activity was suppressed with thapsigargin (200 nm (29Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The same solutions were used with cardiac SR except that an ATP-regenerating system (phospho(enol)pyruvate (5 mm) and pyruvate kinase (25 μg/ml)) was added, and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release was triggered by addition of 20 μm Ca2+ to the cuvette solution. When toxin was examined alone, it was added 2 min after thapsigargin. When peptide was added before toxin, either peptide or an equivalent volume of water (vehicle) was added 2 min after thapsigargin, and then toxin or an equivalent volume of water (vehicle) was added after a further 2 min. Release rates in each experiment were measured 10-20 s after toxin addition. Ca2+ release rate, R, as a function of [toxin] was fitted by a Hill equation, R = Rb + Rmax{1/[1 + (Tx50/Tx)H]}, where Rb is the baseline Ca2+ leak or Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in thapsigargin, Rmax is the maximum toxin-induced release rate, Tx is [toxin], Tx50 the [toxin] for activation to 50% maximum, and H is the Hill coefficient. Statistics—Average data are given as mean ± S.E. The significance of the difference between control and test values was tested a using either (a) a Student's t test, either one or two sided and either for independent or paired data, as appropriate or (b) using the non-parametric “sign” test (30Minum E.W. King B.M. Bear G. Statistical Reasoning in Psychology and Education. 3rd ed. John Wiley & Sons, y, New York1993: 475-494Google Scholar). Differences were considered to be significant when p ≤ 0.05. RyR activity demonstrated two distinct gating modes, a “transient” mode and a maintained “substate” mode. The transient mode comprised all control channel activity and was observed in toxin-modified channels. In this mode, the duration of channel openings varied from ∼0.5 to ∼1000 ms with brief submaximal openings and longer openings to the maximum conductance. The maintained substate mode was seen only after exposure to Imperatoxin A and was characterized by openings lasting from ∼1 to 20 s. The number of transient openings increased with toxin concentrations between 200 pm and 20 nm, then declined with >20 nm toxin. Prolonged substate openings appeared with >100 nm toxin. Increased Transient Activity—Imperatoxin A applied at picomolar concentrations to the cis (cytoplasm) side of RyR channels caused an increase in the frequency of transient openings. The increase occurred rapidly, within the 30-s period of toxin addition and stirring. Prolonged substate openings were not induced with these low toxin concentrations. The activating effect on transient openings was only slowly reversible when the toxin was perfused from the cis chamber (Fig. 1, A-C). Activity increased in cardiac (n = 20 experiments) and skeletal (n = 19) channels that were either Ca2+-activated (cis Ca2+ of 10 or 100 μm; n = 18) or at sub-activating cis [Ca2+] (100-300 nm) (n = 20), in the absence (n = 10) or presence of ATP (n = 17) (with 2 mm Mg2+, n = 4) or AMP-PNP (n = 5) and in DIDS-modified channels (n = 5) (Fig. 1, D and E). All channels were activated by toxin at concentrations up to 10 nm. At 50-300 nm, some channels were activated while others were inhibited. Channels recorded with low cis [Ca2+] showed average activation at higher toxin concentrations than those recorded with higher activating cis [Ca2+] (Fig. 1, D and E). The changes in channel gating associated with increased activity were measured in a subset of data from skeletal and cardiac RyR channels (Table I). The increased activity of skeletal RyRs with 1 and 10 nm toxin was due to an increase in channel open time, and a reduction in closed time. The increase in open time was also seen in cardiac channels, but in contrast to skeletal channels, there was no significant change in closed durations at lower toxin concentrations.Table ISingle channel parameters from a subset of experiments in which one channel only was active in the bilayerSkeletal RyRToxin concentration1 nm10 nm100 nm1 μm10 μmRelative Po4.30 ± 1.08aA significant change in the open probability.4.28 ± 0.82aA significant change in the open probability.3.74 ± 1.14aA significant change in the open probability.2.17 ± 1.032.30 ± 1.29Relative To1.36 ± 0.451.31 ± 0.15aA significant change in the open probability.1.58 ± 0.05aA significant change in the open probability.1.80 ± 0.34aA significant change in the open probability.1.72 ± 0.04aA significant change in the open probability.Relative Tc0.43 ± 0.07aA significant change in the open probability.0.41 ± 0.12aA significant change in the open probability.1.62 ± 0.683.07 ± 1.42.1 ± 0.08Cardiac RyRToxin concentration500 pm1 nm10 nm100 nm1 μmRelative Po1.89 ± 0.24aA significant change in the open probability.2.00 ± 0.37aA significant change in the open probability.1.59 ± 0.37aA significant change in the open probability.1.31 ± 0.260.20 ± 0.06aA significant change in the open probability.Relative To2.21 ± 1.08aA significant change in the open probability.1.59 ± 0.43aA significant change in the open probability.1.70 ± 0.50aA significant change in the open probability.1.32 ± 0.17aA significant change in the open probability.0.50 ± 0.08aA significant change in the open probability.Relative Tc1.12 ± 0.362.06 ± 1.251.32 ± 0.271.29 ± 0.44.65 ± 2.17aA significant change in the open probability.a A significant change in the open probability. Open table in a new tab Inhibition of Transient Activity—Transient channel openings decreased when the toxin was increased to between 50 and 500 nm (see Fig. 1C). Some channels were activated for several minutes after exposure to higher [toxin] and were then inhibited (Fig. 2A). Activity was rapidly restored to an activated (greater than control) level upon removal of the toxin, indicating raid reversibility of the inhibitory action. The inhibition of transient activity was independent of prolonged substate openings. Although all channels exhibiting prolonged substates also showed fewer transient openings, the number of transient openings was often substantially reduced in the absence of substate activity (100 nm toxin (Fig. 2A)). Inhibition reduced Po to less than control when the activity was initially high (in channels with activating cis Ca2+ and/or ATP (Fig. 2A)). When activity was low (in the presence of 100-300 nm Ca2+ and/or MgATP), Po fell to less than the toxin-activated level, but often remained higher than control (e.g. the skeletal channels in Table I). The decline in transient activity was caused by an increase in closed time (Table I). Curiously, the open times in skeletal RyRs continued to increase as toxin concentration increased (Table I), perhaps indicating that the activating effect of the toxin increased with [toxin], but was overwhelmed by an independent inhibitory effect. Persistent inhibition was also seen following perfusion of inhibiting [toxin] from the cis chamber, when removal of inhibition revealed a strong slowly reversible activation (e.g. Fig. 2A). On average, cardiac RyRs showed a significant decline in open times and increase in closed durations when inhibited by 1 μm toxin (Table I). Inhibition was seen in all cardiac (n = 13) and skeletal (n = 9) channels exposed to higher toxin concentrations and was independent of bilayer potential or cis [Ca2+] (n = 9 for ≤300 nm Ca2+ or n = 13 for 10 μm Ca2+), and occurred without ATP or Mg2+ (n = 8) or with 2 mm ATP (n = 14) and 2 mm Mg2+ (n = 4), as well as in DIDS-modified channels (n = 5) (Fig. 2B). Toxin-activated channels were further activated by Ca2+, ATP, or AMP-PNP, whereas inhibited channels could not be activated to the same extent by these ligands (Fig. 2C). In this experiment, with 100 nm cis Ca2+, cardiac RyR channels were either activated or inhibited by 200 nm toxin. The toxin-activated channels were further activated when cis Ca2+ was increased to 100 μm and activated again by either 2 mm ATP or AMP-PNP. In contrast, although activity increased in the toxin-inhibited channels, the increase (relative to control) was significantly less than in the activated channels. Peptide A Competes with Imperatoxin A for Activation of Transient Opening—It has been suggested that peptide A and Imperatoxin A compete for a single site on the RyR. Cardiac channels were activated by 1 nm toxin and by subsequent additions of peptide A up to 500 nm (Fig. 3A). Activity declined when the peptide was increased to 1 μm. However, the plateau of activation with peptide plus toxin was no greater than that with peptide alone, suggesting that there was no summation of the effects of the two compounds and supporting the concept of the same or overlapping binding sites. Similar results were obtained when channels were exposed to 10 nm toxin, although there was a significant reduction in activity when the [peptide] reached 500 nm. In a similar experiment (Fig. 3B), channels were first exposed to 50 nm peptide A and then to increasing concentrations of toxin. Activity tended to increase with peptide plus toxin up to 600 pm, but activation was significantly less than expected from the summation of two independent processes (Fig. 3B). Channel activity declined when higher concentrations of toxin were added with peptide. The decline in activity with higher concentrations of toxin plus peptide A (or modified peptide A (A1-R18D) (18Green D. Pace S. Curtis S.M. Sakowska M. Lamb G.D. Dulhunty A.F. Casarotto M.G. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2079656305,"Genetic amplification at chromosome 8p23.1 has been reported in some solid tumors. Translocation of 8p23.1 has also been reported in hematological malignancies and head and neck squamous cell cancer. In an attempt to clarify whether this translocation is implicated in lymphomagenesis, we performed FISH analysis of the immunoblastic B-cell lymphoma cell line OCI-LY8, which has chromosome translocation at 8p23.1, with various BAC clones. We found split signals on BAC, RP11-18L2 where the MASL1 gene is located. This translocation was found to produce a chimeric transcript of MASL1 exon 1 with a cryptic exon from the genome region at 14q21. Our study indicates that MASL1 is not only a target gene for genomic amplification but also for chromosomal translocation. Since tumorigenic activity of the MASL1 has not been proven, its in vitro transforming activity was studied and in vivo nude mice assay were performed. Although no in vitro transforming activity was detected by focus formation, the in vivo tumorigenesis assay with nude mice showed that both MASL1 and chimeric MASL1 possess tumorigenic activity. This suggests that MASL1 is an important oncogene not only for solid tumors but also for hematologic malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1982683697,"In neuroblastoma (NB), expression of the TrkA receptor is correlated with good prognosis while N-myc amplification is correlated with poor prognosis. Decreased N-myc levels are key to controlling growth and inducing differentiation in NB cells. In this report, we detail mechanisms by which nerve growth factor (NGF) decreases N-myc levels in TrkA-transfected NB cells and its effect on NB cell proliferation. NGF induced a decrease in N-myc mRNA within 1 h of treatment that occurred in the presence of cycloheximide. The stability of N-myc mRNA was not affected by NGF, indicating a transcriptional control of N-myc mRNA by NGF. NGF but not brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) decreased N-myc levels demonstrating that p75 alone was not involved. The NGF-induced decrease in N-myc expression was blocked by the Trk tyrosine kinase (TK) antagonist K252a indicating that signals transduced by Trk TK downstream targets were involved. Pharmacologic inhibitors implicated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) path. This was supported by the finding that expression of a constitutively activated component of the MAPK path, MAPK kinase (MEK), decreased N-myc levels. Alterations in the level of N-myc are known to alter NB cell cycle progression by affecting the levels of E2Fs and p27kip1. Consistent with these findings, NGF decreased NB cell number and decreased cyclin E-dependent kinase activity via an increase in p27kip1. Thus, our results indicate that the MAP kinase is selectively involved in the NGF-induced N-myc downregulation through a transcriptional mechanism. Furthermore, NGF affects the time required for 15N TrkA cells to complete a replication cycle by decreasing N-myc, E2Fs, cyclin E kinase activity and increasing p27kip1 binding to cyclin E kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1965244669,"We demonstrated that ginsenosides, the active ingredient of Panax ginseng, enhance endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl– currents via Gαq/11-phospholipase C-β3 pathway in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Moreover, prolonged treatment of ginsenosides induced Cl– channel desensitization. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization have not yet been determined precisely. To provide answers to these questions, we investigated the changes in ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization after intraoocyte injection of inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6), which is known to bind β-arrestins and interfere with β-arrestin-induced receptor down-regulation, and cRNAs coding β-arrestin I/II and G-protein receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), which is known to phosphorylate G protein-coupled receptors and attenuate agonist stimulations. When control oocytes were stimulated with ginsenosides, the second, third, and fourth responses to ginsenosides were 69.6 ± 4.1, 9.2 ± 2.3, and 2.6 ± 2.2% of the first responses, respectively. Preintraoocyte injection of InsP6 before ginsenoside treatment restored ginsenoside effect to initial response levels in a concentration-, time-, and structurally specific manner, in that inositol hexasulfate had no effect. The EC50 was 13.9 ± 8.7 μM. Injection of cRNA coding β-arrestin I but not β-arrestin II blocked InsP6 effect on prevention of ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization. Injection of cRNA coding GRK2 abolished ginsenoside effect enhancing Cl– current. However, the GRK2-caused loss of ginsenoside effect on Cl– current was prevented by coinjection of GRK2 with GRK2-K220R, a dominant-negative mutant of GRK. These results indicate that ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization is mediated via activation of GRK2 and β-arrestin I. We demonstrated that ginsenosides, the active ingredient of Panax ginseng, enhance endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl– currents via Gαq/11-phospholipase C-β3 pathway in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Moreover, prolonged treatment of ginsenosides induced Cl– channel desensitization. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization have not yet been determined precisely. To provide answers to these questions, we investigated the changes in ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization after intraoocyte injection of inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6), which is known to bind β-arrestins and interfere with β-arrestin-induced receptor down-regulation, and cRNAs coding β-arrestin I/II and G-protein receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), which is known to phosphorylate G protein-coupled receptors and attenuate agonist stimulations. When control oocytes were stimulated with ginsenosides, the second, third, and fourth responses to ginsenosides were 69.6 ± 4.1, 9.2 ± 2.3, and 2.6 ± 2.2% of the first responses, respectively. Preintraoocyte injection of InsP6 before ginsenoside treatment restored ginsenoside effect to initial response levels in a concentration-, time-, and structurally specific manner, in that inositol hexasulfate had no effect. The EC50 was 13.9 ± 8.7 μM. Injection of cRNA coding β-arrestin I but not β-arrestin II blocked InsP6 effect on prevention of ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization. Injection of cRNA coding GRK2 abolished ginsenoside effect enhancing Cl– current. However, the GRK2-caused loss of ginsenoside effect on Cl– current was prevented by coinjection of GRK2 with GRK2-K220R, a dominant-negative mutant of GRK. These results indicate that ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization is mediated via activation of GRK2 and β-arrestin I. Ginseng, the root of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, has been used as a representative tonic for several hundreds years in such countries as Korea, China, and Japan. Currently, ginseng is one of the most famous and precious herbal medicines consumed in around the world (1Tyler V.E. J. Pharm. Technol. 1995; 11: 214-220Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 2Nah S.Y. Kor. J. Ginseng Sci. 1997; 21: 1-12Google Scholar). Recent accumulating evidence shows that ginsenosides are the pharmacologically active ingredient of ginseng. Ginsenoside is one of the derivatives of triterpenoid dammarane, consisting of 30 carbon atoms. Recent studies have suggested that G proteins mediate some ginsenoside effects. For example, Nah and McCleskey (3Nah S.Y. McCleskey E.W. J. Ethnopharmacol. 1994; 42: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and Nah et al. (4Nah S.Y. Park H.J. McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, very little is known about molecular mechanism(s) involved in Cl– channel desensitization induced by ginsenoside treatment. Desensitization of a receptor is defined as the diminished or abolished response to an agonist after repeated stimulation.

The main specialized regulatory proteins for homologous GPCR desensitization process are GRKs and β-arrestins (10Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Cell Dev.

GRKs mediate the phosphorylation of the receptors that are occupied by agonists. The phosphorylated receptors create a binding site for regulatory proteins, β-arrestins, which are involved in the endocytosis of desensitized receptors and bindings of β-arrestins to the phosphorylated receptor facilitate to uncouple it from its target G proteins for termination of effector stimulation (10Ferguson S.S.G.

On the other hand, recent reports showed that InsP6 blocks visual arrestin interaction with phosphorylated rhodopsin by a direct binding to visual arrestin, resulting in elimination of light-induced inactivation of rhodopsin (15Palczewski K.

In the present study, to further characterize the molecular mechanism(s) underlying ginsenoside-induced Ca2+-activated Cl– channel desensitization, we studied the regulation of the coupling between short- and long-term ginsenoside treatment and Ca2+-activated Cl– channel activity in X. laevis oocytes. To this aim, we first examined the changes in ginsenoside-induced desensitization on Ca2+-activated Cl– current after intraoocyte injection of InsP6, which is known to bind β-arrestins and block β-arrestin-dependent receptor trafficking. We further examined the effects of GRK2 after intraoocyte injections of cRNAs coding GRK2. Herein, we present results suggesting that ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization involves the activation of GRK2/β-arrestin I in X. laevis oocytes. Materials—cDNAs coding GRK2 and GRK2-K220R and β-arrestin I and II proteins were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University, Durham, NC). m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor was purchased from Guthrie Research Institute (Sayre, PA) Ginsenosides were provided by Korea Ginseng and Tobacco Research Institute (Taejon, Korea). The stock solution of ginsenosides was prepared and used as described in previous experiment (5Choi S. Rho S.H. Jung S.Y. Kim S.C. Park C.S. Nah S.Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). InsP6 was obtained from Calbiochem, and all other agents were obtained from Sigma. In Vitro Synthesis of cRNA—Recombinant plasmids containing cDNA inserts for GRK2, GRK2-K220R, β-arrestin I/II, or m1 mAChR proteins were linearized by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes. The cRNAs from linearized templates were obtained with an in vitro transcription kit (mMessage mMachine; Ambion, Austin, TX) using an SP6, T3, or T7 RNA polymerase. The RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water at 1 μg/μl, divided into aliquots, and stored at –70 °C until used. Oocyte Preparation—X. laevis frogs were obtained from Xenopus I (Ann Arbor, MI). Their care and handling were in accordance with the highest standards of institutional guidelines. To isolate oocytes, frogs were operated on under anesthesia with an aerated solution of 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. Oocytes were separated by treatment with collagenase and agitation for 2 h in a Ca2+-free medium containing 82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Stage V–VI oocytes were collected and stored in ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.5 mm theophylline and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. This oocyte-containing solution was maintained at 18 °C with continuous gentle shaking and changed every day. Oocyte Treatment before Electrophysiological Recordings—In the first series of experiments, InsP6 or InsS6 (10 nl each), freshly dissolved in distilled water, was injected into cytosol, and electrophysiological recordings were performed 20 min after injection except as indicated otherwise. In the second series of experiments, the oocytes were injected with cRNA(s) at 40 ng/oocyte (or concentrations as indicated), and electrophysiological recordings were performed 2 days later. Control oocytes were injected with 40 nl of H2O. Electrophysiological Recording—Two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from individual oocytes placed in a small Plexiglas net chamber (0.5 ml), which was continuously superfused with the bathing medium (i.e. ND96). The microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had a resistance of 0.2–0.7 MΩ. The electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature using an Oocyte Clamp amplifier (OC-725C; Warner Instrument, Hamden, CT). Linear leak and capacitance currents were corrected with a leak subtraction procedure. Ginsenosides were applied to oocytes by bath perfusion (17Choi S. Lee J.H. Kim Y.I. Kang M.J. Rhim H. Lee S.K. Nah S.Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 468: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—To obtain the concentration-response curve in the presence of InsP6, the observed peak amplitudes were normalized and plotted and then fitted to the Hill equation below using Origin software (Northampton, MA): y/ymax = [A]nH /([A]nH + [EC50]nH), where y is the percentage inhibition at a given concentration of InsP6, ymax is the maximal peak current, EC50 is the concentration of InsP6 producing half-maximum effect of the control response to ginsenosides, [A] is the concentration of InsP6, and nH is the interaction coefficient. All values are presented as means ± S.E. The differences between means of control and ginsenoside treatment data were analyzed using unpaired Student’s t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Rapid Desensitization of Ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– Current Responses after Repeated Application of Ginsenosides or ACh—In the present study, we examined the changes in ginsenoside effect on the Cl– current after repeated application of ginsenosides. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of ginsenosides induced Cl– current enhancement in a voltage-dependent manner. The reversal potential was near –20 mV, indicating that ginsenosides activate endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl– currents in X. laevis oocytes (5Choi S. Rho S.H. Jung S.Y. Kim S.C. Park C.S. Nah S.Y. Br.

Oocytes first stimulated with ginsenosides were washed with ND96 for 3–5 min until the basal current was recovered again and then restimulated with ginsenosides. The second, third, or fourth Cl– current responses for ginsenosides were dramatically diminished, and the magnitudes of Cl– current were 69.6 ± 4.1, 9.2 ± 2.3, and 2.6 ± 2.2%, respectively, of the first responses of ginsenosides (n = 15 oocytes each from three different batches of donors) (Fig. 1B, inset). As a positive control, cRNA coding m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) was injected into oocytes; receptor activation also enhances Cl– currents via Gαq/11-PLC-inositol trisphosphate pathway (18Hill J.J. Peralta E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5505-5510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Repeated treatment of oocytes expressing m1 mAChR with ACh resulted in a gradual attenuation of the magnitude of Cl– current. The second, third, or fourth Cl– current responses for ginsenosides were diminished, and the magnitudes of Cl– current were 14.2 ± 7.1, 8.3 ± 6.3, and 4.1 ± 3.2%, respectively, of the first responses of ACh (n = 13 oocytes each from three different batches of donors) (Figs. 3C and 5B).Fig. 3Effect of InsP6 after GTS- or ACh-induced short- or long-term Cl– channel desensitization.

Ferguson J.E. Sharif M. Hanley M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 380-385PubMed Google Scholar), the above results prompted us to test the possibility that InsP6 might also prevent ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization. As the first step toward testing this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of InsP6 on the rapid loss of Cl– current responses after short-term treatment with ginsenosides or ACh. We injected InsP6 (100 μm intracellular concentration) into oocytes 20 min before treatment with ginsenosides or ACh. Preintraoocyte injection of InsP6 neither changes basal membrane current compared with H2O-injected oocytes (H2O/InsP6 = 0.24 ± 0.05/0.22 ± 0.07 μA, n = 15 each) nor affects ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– current responses (Figs. 1D, inset, and 5B). However, as shown in Fig. 1, C and D, preintraoocyte injection of InsP6 not only prevented the loss of ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– current response but also slightly enhanced ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– current response (Fig. 1D, inset and Fig. 5B). The second, third, or fourth Cl– current response for ginsenosides was maintained, and the magnitudes of the current were 106.6 ± 3.1, 134.8 ± 5.3, and 138.7 ± 7.2%, respectively, of the first responses of ginsenosides (n = 12 oocytes each; from three different batches of donors) (Fig. 1D, inset). For m1 mAChR, the second, third, or fourth Cl– current response for ACh was also maintained, and the magnitudes of the current were 102.4 ± 10.1, 94.8 ± 12.3, and 114.7 ± 13.2%, respectively, of the first responses of ACh (n = 12 oocytes each; from three different batches of donors) (Fig. 5B). Concentration- and Time-dependent Effects of InsP6 on Ginsenoside-induced Cl– Channel Desensitization—Fig. 2A shows the concentration-dependent response curve for prevention by InsP6 on the loss of ginsenoside-induced Cl– current responses. InsP6 prevented the loss of ginsenoside-induced Cl– current responses in a dose-dependent manner. The EC50 was 13.9 ± 8.7 μm. These inhibitory effects on desensitization were not simply a result of anionic charge, because the InsP6 analog-like inactive InsS6 had no effect, indicating that the attenuating effect on ginsenoside-induced desensitization of Ca2+ activated Cl– current is specific to InsP6 (Fig. 2A, inset). Fig. 2B shows the time course of onset of the inhibitory effect of InsP6 on ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization. The inhibitory effect reached a maximum level 15 min after intraoocyte injection, and the effect was persistent for at least 6 h. Effect of InsP6 on Restimulation of Ginsenosides or ACh In Oocytes Undergoing Short- or Long-Term Treatment with Ginsenosides or ACh—As a next step, we examined whether intraoocyte injection of InsP6 to oocytes that have been desensitized by several repeated ginsenoside treatments or oocytes expressing m1 mAChRs that have also been desensitized by several repeated ACh treatments could prevent ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– channel desensitization. As shown in Fig. 3, InsP6-injected oocytes that were desensitized previously by short-term treatment with ginsenosides or ACh failed to respond to ginsenoside or ACh treatment. We also tested whether intraoocyte injection of InsP6 in oocytes that have been undergone prolonged treatment with ginsenosides (100 μg/ml, 16 h) or ACh (100 μM, 16 h) could affect ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– current responses, because long-term treatment of ginsenosides or ACh induced the loss of ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– current responses (Fig. 3, B and D, inset). Initial treatment of ginsenosides or ACh in oocytes that have been undergone prolonged treatment with ginsenosides or ACh failed to enhance Ca2+-activated Cl– current, indicating that long-term treatment of ginsenosides or ACh induces Cl– channel desensitization. Moreover, in oocytes that have been undergone prolonged treatment with ginsenosides or ACh, the loss of Cl– current response to ginsenosides or ACh was not restored by intraoocyte injection of the InsP6. Time Course of Recovery of Ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– Channel Desensitization—To characterize recovery from Cl– channel desensitization at longer times, we employed the following procedure: ginsenosides or ACh response was recorded in 13–14 oocytes (control group), and the mean control response was calculated. Test group oocytes were exposed to ginsenosides (100 μg/ml) or ACh (100 μm) for 30 min, completely washed several times with ND96, and then the response to the second application of ginsenosides or ACh was measured in these oocytes during the indicated times. As shown in Fig. 4, initial recovery of ginsenoside-induced Cl– current response during the first 5–60 min remained about 5–30% of control and was followed by 60% recovery over 2–4 h, whereas initial recovery of ACh-induced Cl– current response during the first 5–120 min remained about 1–3% of control and was followed by 10–45% recovery over 4–8 h. Thus, recovery time on ACh-induced Cl– response from desensitization was slower than that of ginsenoside-induced Cl– response; the half-recovery time to control level from desensitization was about 145.8 ± 63 and 619.5 ± 26.9 min for ginsenosides and m1 mAChRs, respectively. However, ginsenoside- and ACh-induced Cl– current responses had nearly recovered to initial control levels after 24 h. Overexpression of β-Arrestin I but Not β-Arrestin II Blocks InsP6 Effect on Ginsenoside- and ACh-induced Cl– Channel Desensitization—As a next step, we tested whether or not overexpression of β-arrestins related with receptor desensitization could affect ginsenosides or ACh effect on Cl– current. We also tested whether or not overexpression of these proteins could affect InsP6-induced attenuation on ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– channel desensitization. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, intraoocyte injection of cRNA coding β-arrestin I or β-arrestin II did not affect either basal Cl– current (H2O/β-arrestin I = 0.22 ± 0.04:0.21 ± 0.06 μA; H2O/β-arrestin II = 0.20 ± 0.04: 0.23 ± 0.03 μA; n = 15 each) or the Cl– current evoked by initial ginsenoside treatment (H2O/β-arrestin I = 3.5 ± 0.2: 3.2 ± 0.5 μA; H2O/β-arrestin II = 3.5 ± 0.2:3.1 ± 0.1 μA; n = 15 each) (Fig. 5). However, intraoocyte injection of cRNA coding β-arrestin I significantly blocked the preventive effect of InsP6 on ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization in the fourth treatment of ginsenosides (H2O + InsP6/β-arrestin I + InsP6 = 4.8 ± 0.8:1.3 ± 0.4 μA; p < 0.01; measured at a Vc value of +60 mV, n = 15 oocytes each, from three different batches of frogs), whereas intraoocyte injection of cRNA coding β-arrestin II failed to block the preventive effect of InsP6 (H2O + InsP6/β-arrestin II + InsP6 = 4.8 ± 0.8:3.9 ± 0.7 μA). Similarly, we could also observe that preintraoocyte injection of InsP6 prevented the loss of ACh-induced Cl– current response in oocytes expressing m1 mAChRs and that injection of cRNA coding β-arrestin I (ACh + InsP6/β-arrestin I + InsP6 = 4.6 ± 0.8/1.7 ± 0.4 μA; p < 0.01; measured at a Vc value of +60 mV, n = 14 oocytes each, from three different batches of frogs) but not β-arrestin II (ACh + InsP6/β-arrestin II + InsP6 = 4.8 ± 0.8:4.0 ± 0.6 μA) blocked the effect of InsP6 on prevention of ACh-induced Cl– channel desensitization (Fig. 5B). Overexpression of GRK2 Inhibits the Effect of Ginsenoside or ACh on Cl– Current Enhancement—Because the results above showed the possibility that β-arrestin I might participate the desensitization signaling pathway on a loss of ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– current responses, we investigated the roles of GRK in the effect of ginsenoside or ACh on Cl– current enhancement. We first injected cRNA coding GRK2 alone or coinjected cRNAs coding m1 mAChR and GRK2 into oocytes and observed the effect of ginsenoside or ACh on Cl– current. As summarized in Fig. 6, A and B, ginsenosides or ACh applied to H2O-injected vehicle oocytes enhanced the Cl– current. In contrast, ginsenosides or ACh failed to enhance the Cl– current in cells injected with cRNA coding GRK2 or cRNAs coding m1 mAChR and GRK2 (Fig. 6, A and B). However, intraoocyte injection of cRNA coding GRK2-K220R, which is a dominant-negative mutant of GRK2 and lacks kinase activity, had no effect on ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– current enhancement. Moreover, coexpression of GRK2 and GRK2-K220R abolished the inhibitory effect of GRK2 on ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– current enhancement. The extent of the blockade of the ginsenoside effect on Cl– current by GRK2 cRNA injection was proportional to the amount of cRNA injected (Fig. 6C), and the time required for the injected cRNAs to work was >16 h (Fig. 6D). Repeated treatment of ginsenosides or ACh in oocytes expressing m1 mAChR induced a loss of Cl– current response in oocytes injected with cRNAs coding GRK2-K220R alone and cRNAs coding GRK2 and GRK2-K220R, respectively (Fig. 6, A and B). Effects of InsP6 on PMA-evoked Loss of Ginsenoside-induced Cl– Current Responses—The activation of PLC produces lipidsoluble 1,2-diacylglycerol, an endogenous protein kinase C (PKC) activator. Previous reports showed that activation of PKC by treatment with PMA, an active PKC activator, causes receptor phosphorylation and receptor uncoupling from PLC-mediated inositol phospholipid metabolism, resulting in a loss of Cl– current responses by agonist stimulations (19Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Cotecchia F.S. Lomasney J.W. Debernaardis J.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5651-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 20Orellana S. Solski P.A.

As shown in Fig. 7, treatment with PMA, but not 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, an inactive PKC activator, induced a loss of ginsenoside-induced Cl– current enhancement but PKA activators had no effect on ginsenoside-induced Cl– current responses (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of PMA was dose-dependent, and the IC50 was 35.6 ± 4.7 nm (Fig. 7B, inset). But cotreatment of the PKC inhibitor staurosporine with PMA prevented PMA-induced inhibition of the ginsenoside effect on Cl– currents, indicating that PMA-evoked loss of ginsenoside-induced Cl– current responses is specific to PKC activation. We also tested whether preintraoocyte injection of InsP6 prevent PMA-induced inhibition on ginsenoside-evoked Cl– current. However, as shown in Fig. 7B, preintraoocyte injection of InsP6 had no effect on PMA-induced loss of ginsenoside-evoked Cl– current responses. Although ginsenosides, the active ingredient of Panax ginseng, have been widely used as pharmacological agents for a long time, few reports have related ginsenoside signal transduction until now. In previous studies, we demonstrated that activation of membrane components by ginsenosides at the extracellular side enhanced a Ca2+-activated Cl– current via a Gαq/11-phospholipase C-β3 pathway. We showed also that prolonged treatment with ginsenosides induced a desensitization of Cl– current response after reaching peak amplitude in X. laevis oocytes (5Choi S. Rho S.H. Jung S.Y. Kim S.C. Park C.S. Nah S.Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Choi S. Kim H.J. Ko Y.S. Jeong S.W. Kim Y.I. Simonds W.F. Oh J.W. Nah S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48797-48802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The present study was performed to further characterize the desensitization signaling pathway of a loss of ginsenoside-induced Cl– current response. In this study, we have provided three principal findings affirming that GRK2 and β-arrestin I are involved in the main molecular mechanisms mediating ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization in X. laevis oocytes. First, we showed that short- or long-term treatment with ginsenosides induced a complete loss of ginsenoside effect on Cl– current enhancement, whereas preintraoocyte injection of InsP6, but not InsS6 (an inactive analog of InsP6), prevented the desensitization of Cl– current induced by repeated treatment with ginsenosides. These results support the concept that the attenuating effect on ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization is specific to InsP6. The EC50 (13.9 ± 8.7 μm) obtained from the present study was relatively high and suggests that InsP6 interacts with β-arrestin I with low affinity. However, there was structural specificity for InsP6 but not InsS6, and the potency of the Cl– channel desensitization-blocking action of InsP6 was very similar to the concentration of InsP6 binding to arrestins (16Palczewski K. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Gutmann C. Hoffman K.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, because the concentration of InsP6 in variety of cells is in the range of 1–20 μm, the EC50 values for this pharmacological action might be physiologically significant (24Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Tashjian A.H. Berridge M.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1985; 119: 395-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Szwergold B.S. Graham R.A. Brown T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 14: 874-881Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that intraoocyte injection of InsP6 did not restore ginsenoside or ACh responses on Ca2+-activated Cl– channels after short- or long-term Cl– channel desensitization caused by ginsenoside or ACh treatment had already occurred (Fig. 3). The present study further suggested that membrane component(s) or m1 mAChR that might be interacting with ginsenosides or ACh could be down-regulated after short- or long-term treatment with ginsenosides or ACh and that intraoocyte injected-InsP6 was no more helpful for the down-regulated membrane components or m1 mAChRs. As for the second piece of evidence for the role of β-arrestins in ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization, we demonstrated that overexpression of β-arrestin I cRNA, but not β-arrestin II cRNA, induced ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– channel desensitization in oocytes or in oocytes expressing m1 mAChRs that were preinjected with InsP6 before ginsenoside or ACh treatment. These results suggest that extra copies of β-arrestin I produced by injection of cRNAs coding β-arrestin I might bind with InsP6 and sequestrate free InsP6 by forming complexes with InsP6 and β-arrestin I. Therefore, the results of the experiments performed with β-arrestin I further suggest that β-arrestin I mediates ginsenoside- and m1 mAChR-induced Cl– channel desensitization. The third and final piece of evidence suggesting a role for GRK2 in ginsenoside- and m1 mAChR-induced Cl– current desensitization comes from the experiments involving injections of cRNAs coding GRK2, which is known to phosphorylate GPCRs after agonist stimulation and facilitate β-arrestin binding to phosphorylated receptors for the receptor down-regulation process. The results of these experiments (i.e. blocking of the ginsenoside or ACh effect that enhances Ca2+-activated Cl– current by GRK2 cRNA injection but not by dominant-negative GRK2-K220R, which lacks kinase activity, and blocking of GRK action by cRNA coinjection of GRK2 and dominant-negative GRK2-K220R) suggest that the kinase activity of GRK2 is a key role for the inhibitory effect on ginsenoside- and m1 mAChR-induced Cl– current enhancement and that the kinase activity of GRK2 is also involved in signaling pathway of ginsenoside- or m1 mAChR-induced Cl– channel desensitization. Moreover, these results further suggest that phosphorylation of membrane receptors by GRK2 that might interact with ginsenosides or phosphorylation of m1 mAChR by GRK2 could be enough for ginsenoside- or m1 mAChR-induced Cl– channel desensitization (Fig. 6). Recent studies have indicated that β-arrestin I as well as β-arrestin II are involved in GPCR desensitization after their respective agonist stimulations (10Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref Scopus (375) Google Scholar). However, the present study does not support the idea that β-arrestin II functions as a direct mediator of ginsenoside- or m1 mAChR-induced Cl– channel desensitization. Most of the GPCRs that couple to the activation of pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein and PLC and the release of Ca2+ from inositol trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular stores showed indistinguishable affinity to both β-arrestin isoforms and formed a stable complexes with β-arrestin I or II even after 1 h (9Oakely R.H.

Cell. 1998; 9: 2305-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In present study, we also observed that once a loss on ginsenoside- or ACh-induced Cl– current responses by short-term and repeated treatment with ginsenoside or ACh was initiated, the desensitization lasted for up to 8 h before complete recovery (Fig. 4). However, at present, we can offer no satisfactory explanation for the lack of effect of β-arrestin II cRNA injection on ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization. To clarify the exact role of β-arrestins in ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization, further studies will be needed. We also tested the role of second messenger-dependent protein kinase (i.e. PKC) activation on ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization. As shown in Fig. 7, it is likely that the desensitization pathway via PKC activation on ginsenoside-induced Cl– current enhancement might be mediated via a different pathway compared with β-arrestin I-mediated Cl– current desensitization, because preintraoocyte injection of InsP6 did not reverse PMA-evoked loss of ginsenoside-induced Cl– current responses (27Kato K.I. Kaneko S. Nomura Y. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Barish M.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 342: 309-325Crossref Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 29Ito I. Hirono C. Yamagishi S. Nomura Y. Kaneko S. Sugiyama H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). What is the mechanism of desensitization by PKC if it does not involve β-arrestins? Previous reports demonstrated that treatment with a PKC activator (i.e. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) not only attenuated ACh- or 5-HT-induced Ca2+-activated Cl– current enhancement in X. laevis oocytes injected with rat brain mRNA but also increased phosphorylation of oocyte membrane proteins (27Kato K.I. Kaneko S. Nomura Y. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). But treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate had no effect on Cl– current enhancement evoked by intraoocyte injection of inositol trisphosphate or Ca2+ (28Barish M.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 342: 309-325Crossref Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 29Ito I. Hirono C. Yamagishi S. Nomura Y. Kaneko S. Sugiyama H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, PMA-induced desensitization was also not affected by intraoocyte-injected InsP6. These results suggest that the main role of PKC activation in terminating ginsenoside action on Cl– current enhancement might be the phosphorylation of membrane proteins that interact with ginsenosides or other proteins involved in the ginsenoside signaling pathway, such as the Gαq family, rather than β-arrestins (30Aragay A.M. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4807-4815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, intraoocyte injection of InsP6 did not reverse 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-caused loss of substance P-induced Cl– current responses (12Sasakawa N. Ferguson J.E. Sharif M. Hanley M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 380-385PubMed Google Scholar). Because we could not explain exactly the mechanism of PMA-induced desensitization on ginsenoside-induced Cl– current response, further studies will be needed to clarify the role of PKC activation in ginsenoside-induced Cl– channel desensitization We also investigated recovery time kinetics from Cl– channel desensitization in both ginsenosides and m1 mAChRs in X. laevis oocytes. The half-recovery time to control level from desensitization was about 145.8 ± 63 and 619.5 ± 26.9 min for ginsenosides and m1 mAChRs, respectively. Interestingly, in myenteric neurons, substance P stimulation of neurokinin receptor-1, which is also coupled to the Gαq/11-PLC-inositol trisphosphate pathway, induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and half-recovery time to control levels from desensitization induced by repeated treatment of substance P was about 20 min (13McConalogue K. Corvera C.U. Gamp P.D. Grady E.F. Bunnet N.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2305-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that the time course for resensitization on ginsenosides and m1 mAChR from Cl– channel desensitization in X. laevis oocytes was much slower compared with neurokinin receptor-1 in neurons. However, recent reports also showed that various other GPCRs expressed in X. laevis oocytes did not recover as rapidly to control levels from desensitization as neurokinin receptor-1 in neurons did. For example, in oocytes expressing the endothelinA receptor, Ca2+-activated Cl– current response to endothelin1 from desensitization was not completely recovered even after 90 min (31Cyr C.T. Rudy B. Kris R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26071-26074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in oocytes injected with rat brain mRNAs, Ca2+-activated Cl– current responses to ACh and serotonin from desensitization recovered partially after 60 min and recovered completely only after 240 min, respectively (23Singer D. Boton R. Moran O. Dascal N. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Dascal N. Ifune C. Hopkins R. Snutch T.P. Lubbert H. Davidson N. Simon M.I. Lester H.A. Mol. Brain Res. 1986; 1: 201-209Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These different recovery times might be caused by different types of cells, and further studies will be needed to clarify the recovery time discrepancy between X. laevis oocytes and neurons. In summary, using an X. laevis oocyte model system for explanation of ginsenoside signaling pathway that allows various foreign gene expressions, we obtained further results suggesting that GRK2 and β-arrestin I mediate ginsenosideinduced Ca2+-activated Cl– channel desensitization. This may be one of the desensitization signaling pathways that underlies ginseng action."
https://openalex.org/W2131636785,"In the present study, the role of the C-terminal α-helical domain (amino acid (aa) 195–208) of the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor was investigated. Deletions of the VHL C-terminus up to the naturally occurring 195-Gln-Term resulted in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α downregulation in renal cell carcinoma (RCC)4 cells during normoxia, suggesting that this domain is not an absolute requirement for the ubiquitination of HIF-1α. However, detailed investigation of the ubiquitin protein isopeptide ligase ubiquitin ligase properties of VHL revealed C-terminal deletions to cause a significant impairment of HIF-1α ubiquitination, which is shown to be due to a loss in high-affinity binding to the target substrate. When VHL regulation of both HIF-1α N- and C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domains (HIF-ODDD) was investigated, it was found that only ubiquitination of the C-terminal HIF-ODDD was affected by the deletion of the VHL C-terminus. When RCC4 cells expressing C-terminal truncations of VHL were exposed to graded hypoxia, differences in the induction of HIF-1α were observed in comparison with full-length VHL, with a shift in the maximal induction of HIF-1α to a higher oxygen tension. These changes were accompanied by increased glucose transporter 1 expression, p300 CH1 domain binding and HIF-mediated reporter activity. We have thus defined a role for the C-terminal α-helical domain of VHL in the regulation of HIF-1α."
https://openalex.org/W2032345461,"Here we examine the ability of seven, 3′-related, short synthetic RNAs to serve as templates for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) polymerase, non-structural protein 5B (NS5B). These RNAs, termed HL, range from 8 to 16 nucleotides in length, each with ACC at the 3′ terminus. Interestingly HL12 and longer templates have a predicted secondary structure. Those with one or two unpaired adenylates at the 5′-end of a stem were increased in size by one or two nucleotides, respectively, following incubation with NS5B and UTP. Using labeled template RNA and cold UTP, extension in size could be inhibited by addition of non-labeled template of the same size. This template elongation was not inhibited by cold linear HL10 template unless pGpG was added. Fluorescence anisotropy demonstrated HL14, a template with secondary structure, bound with an apparent Kd of 22 nm. A linear template, HL10, plus pGpG primer was bound by NS5B with a Kd of 45 nm, whereas HL10 alone bound with an apparent Kd of 182 nm. The amplitude of the template extension product was increased by a brief preincubation at 4 °C followed by incubation at 23 or 30 °C. The nucleotide-mediated increase in size occurred for both templates that required a mismatch or bulge at the 3′-end as well as for those without the mismatch. These results suggest an NS5B active site pocket can readily accommodate short templates with four or five base stems and initiate copy-back replication in the presence of a one nucleotide mismatch.

Current therapy, interferon-based products plus ribavirin, has a broad side-effects profile and is marginally effective especially in HCV genotype 1. An effective vaccine is also not available. HCV, a flavivirus, is a positive strand RNA virus that encodes at least 10 proteins, including a viral polymerase. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is one of the key enzymes involved in replication and a primary target for the development of antiviral drugs. The crystal structures for NS5B protein in the absence of RNA, determined by three different laboratories independently (3Ago H. Adachi T. Yoshida A. Yamamoto M. Habuka N. Yatsunami K. Miyano M.

The thumb subdomain plays a role in positioning the RNA for initiation and elongation. Unique to NS5B the space between the fingers and the thumb domains is small with a short loop connecting these two domains. This loop is likely responsible for the closed conformation of HCV NS5B, as observed in the crystal structure of φ6 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (6Butcher S.J. Grimes J.M. Makeyev E.V Bamford D.H. Stuart D.I. Nature. 2001; 410: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The β-hairpin, seen in the crystal structure overhanging the active site of NS5B, blocks RNA entry to the active site. It has been proposed that the β-hairpin functions to position the 3′ terminus of RNA templates into the correct position for replication (7Hong Z. Cameron C.E. Walker M.P. Castro C. Yao N. Lau J.Y. Zhong W. Virology. 2001; 285: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Because the β-hairpin obstructs the active site of the enzyme and limits the entry of double-stranded RNA, it is not clear that NS5B can bind double-stranded RNA and efficiently initiate template transcription (7Hong Z.

The RNA synthesis catalyzed by NS5B is a nucleotide transfer elongation reaction, where nucleotidyl residues are transferred to the 3′-hydroxyl group of the last nucleotide of the primer-region, hybridized to the template.

In this report we examine the ability of NS5B to interact with several short synthetic RNA templates, comparing binding of enzyme to template and the generation of products. NS5B activity was compared for enzyme with a truncation of 21 or 55 of the C-terminal amino acids. We report that an RNA template with secondary structure is preferentially bound and more efficient at generating template-directed product via a template elongation mechanism compared with binding to a linear RNA with the same 3′ region. It is of interest that templates with secondary structure without and with a mismatch at the 3′-end will yield products formed by template elongation. These results should aid in developing highly specific templates for NS5B as well as potent inhibitors of viral RdRp. Protein Expression and Purification—The NS5B 1b-BKΔ21-His gene was constructed from hybridized DNA oligomers and PCR products, using standard molecular biology techniques. The PCR template was plasmid pRC/CMV-HCV-BK, which contains the genotype 1b BK genomic HCV cDNA, similar to HCV-1b GenBank™ accession number M58335. Oligomers and PCR primers were based upon the M58335 sequence. The NS5B gene was altered by deleting the 21 C terminus amino acid codons, adding 3-prime codons specifying a Gly-Ser-Gly linker followed by a 6-histidine tag, and adding an 5-prime NdeI site to provide the initiating bacterial ATG. Other restriction sites were added or removed silently to facilitate cloning. Several codons at the beginning and end of the gene were changed, to high frequency bacterial codons. This resulted in a 5′ sequence of atg tct atg tcc tac acc tgg act ggt gct ctg atc acc ccg for both Δ21 and Δ55. The 3′ sequence for Δ21 was ccg cgt gga tcc ggc cac cat cat cac cat cac taa tag, the 3′ sequence for Δ55 was aac tgg gca gtg aag acc aaa ctg aaa ctg taa tag. The assembled gene was inserted into Escherichia coli expression vector pRSETb (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) between the NdeI and EcoRI sites, and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence in the non-oligomer, non-PCR primer derived regions differed from M58335 only at position 544, where the R commonly found in many 1b isolates was converted to a Q in this BK isolate. Sequencing of the pRC/CMV-HCV-BK PCR template around the position of the difference confirmed that the template encodes Q at this position. The NS5B 1b-BKΔ55 gene was constructed from restriction and PCR fragments and inserted into pRSETb, using the constructed NS5B 1b-BKΔ21-His gene as template, deleting the His tag region and 34 additional C terminus amino acid codons. The resulting plasmids were sequenced and found to have the predicted amino acid sequence. BL21 DE3 cells transformed with the expression clone were grown to saturation at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium. A 10-liter LB fermentation vessel at 37 °C was then inoculated with the 1-liter pre-culture and grown up to an optical density (OD) of 5. The growth temperature was then dropped to 15 °C before inducing the cells up to an OD of 12–15 with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, frozen in pellets, and stored at -80 °C. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 5% glycerol) and at 4 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors, lysed, using a combination of three passages on a microfluidizer and four 20-s bursts of ultrasound on a sonicator. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation. For the purification of 1b-BKΔ21C-His the lysate was bound to a nickel column (Qiagen NTA SuperFlow) and washed. The His tag protein was then eluted with 200 mm imidazole (J.T. Baker), 350 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT (ICN), and 2.5% glycerol (Fluka). This peak fraction was then passed through an HS column see below. For the purification of 1b-BKΔ55 (no tag) the bacterial lysate was passed first through a Poros PI chromatography column (Poros). The PI flowthrough fraction was collected and diluted 3-fold to decrease the salt before applying to a Poros HS chromatography column. Following a wash the HS column was resolved by a sodium chloride gradient of 0.2 to 1.2 m. The fractions containing the polymerase were selected by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated on Millipore concentrators by centrifugation (10,000 molecular weight cut-off). The ionic strength of the sample was then adjusted by dilution to 11.5 millisiemens/cm and loaded onto a Toyopearl AF-Heparine-650S chromatography column. A sodium chloride gradient from 0.1 to 1 m eluted the polymerase. For the 1b-BKΔ21 C-His this was the last step in the purification. For the 1b-BKΔ55 the selected fractions were again pooled and diluted down to a conductivity equal to 11.5 millisiemens/cm before being loaded onto a Toyopearl CM-650S chromatography column. The polymerase eluted half way through a 0.2 to 1 m sodium chloride gradient. The polymerase fractions were then concentrated and applied onto a size exclusion chromatography pre-equilibrated in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT. The protein eluted in a monomeric form as compared with molecular weight standards injected in the same buffer system. Peak fractions of the polymerase were dialyzed against 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 50% glycerol, and stored at -80 °C. Labeling 5′-End RNA Template—End labeling of RNA template was performed using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as recommended in the protocols and applications guide. Labeling reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in a 50-μl volume containing 50 pmol of RNA, 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (in buffer 70 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, pH 7.6). After labeling, the reaction mixture was extracted twice with equivalent volume of phenol-chloroform. The 5′-radioactively labeled RNA was precipitated with ethanol by incubation at -80 °C overnight in the presence of glycogen as carrier, and 10% of 3 m NaOAc (pH 5.2). This was centrifuged at 4 °C, for 15 min at 13,000 × g, and the labeled RNA pellet washed with 70% ethanol to remove residual salt and aid lyophilization. This pellet was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and the concentration of 5′-labeled RNA determined by the 260-nm absorbance. [32P]UMP Incorporation Assay Using Unlabeled Template—Reactions were carried out with 20 μl of buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mm DTT, 0.25 unit of RNasin/μl (Promega), 100 ng of bovine serum albumin/μl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2% glycerol. 1 μm RNA template, 1.25 μm NS5B, 10 μm pGpG (oligonucleotides etc.), 100 μm UTP, 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) label. A mixture of NS5B and RNA template was preincubated for 5 min prior to the initiation by the addition of NTP solution. The reaction was carried out at room temperature (23 °C) for 30 min and then quenched by the addition of 20 μl quenching buffer (90% formamide, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol) or 2× TBE-urea sample buffer (1× TBE, Tris base, boric acid, EDTA, Ficoll 1.2 g/10 ml, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 7 m urea). The quenched reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C for 3 min prior to loading 3 μl onto a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide/7 m urea/Tris borate/EDTA (TBE) gel. Electrophoresis was performed in 1× TBE at 70–90 watts. Following vacuum drying of gels, bands containing isotope were visualized and analyzed using a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). Time Course Reaction and Data Analysis—Reactions were run similarly as described above. 2 μm RNA template and 2.5 μm NS5B in the above standard assay buffer were preincubated for 5 min at 23 °C and initiated by the addition of a mixture of 10 μm pGpG and 200 μm UTP, 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (values are final concentrations). The reaction time data points were recorded from initiation and to the addition of quenching buffer. The amount of product formed was analyzed by denaturing 20% polyacrylamide/7 m urea/Tris borate/EDTA (TBE) gel electrophoresis. Rate data were fit to a burst equation in product formation (Product(t) = (A(1 - exp(-kobst))) + ksst), where A is the maximal amplitude and kobs is the exponential burst rate constant of the reaction, kss is the steady-state rate constant. Nucleotide Incorporation Assay Using 5′-End-labeled Template—Using cold nucleotide the assay was performed as above with the following modifications. The reaction volume was 20 μl in standard replication buffer with 1 μm of 5′-labeled RNA template, 1.25 μm NS5B, and 100 μm cold UTP with/without 10 μm pGpG primer. The template and enzyme were preincubated for 5 min, and the reaction mixture was initiated by the addition of NTP solution at the indicated temperature for 30 min or as stated. The product were resolved on denaturing 20% polyacrylamide/7 m urea/Tris borate/EDTA (TBE) gel and RNA bands were quantified by phosphorimaging. Fluorescence Anisotropy—Tetramethylrhodamine-labeled oligonucleotides (Dharmacon Research Co.) were generated by attaching the fluorophore to the 5′-end of RNA via a 5′-amino-modifier linker, post synthesis. Labeled RNAs were purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Fluorescence experiments were performed using a QM-1 Photon Technology International T-formate fluorometer with excitation monochromator set to 560 nm with a 3- to 5-nm slit width and emission monochromator set to 585 nm with slip width of 6–8 nm. All measurements were carried out at 23 °C. Titrations of the 1b-BKΔ55 were carried out in a standard replication buffer described above. We obtained the dissociation constant value using, y=(x+Kd+R)-(x+Kd+R)2-4Rx2R(Eq. 1) where y is the fraction of the RNA bound complex, R is the total concentration of fluorescently labeled RNA, x is the total concentration of added enzyme, and Kd is the dissociation constant. The increase in fluorescence anisotropy, converted to the fraction of bound RNA, was used to fit the Kd for the accumulated enzyme concentration. Use of Synthetic RNA Templates—To better understand the molecular mechanism for NS5B initiation we derived seven short RNA templates, six containing identical 8-nt sequence from the 3′-end and all having two 3′-cytidylates. Starting with HL8, two nucleotides were added to the 5′-end forming HL10, HL12, HL14-nb or HL14 and HL16 (Table I). HL13-nb has a different stem region. HL16, HL14, and HL12, can form an off-set homo-dimer consisting of a 4-bp stem/-3-bp loop/-4-bp stem or a hairpin, consisting of a intramolecular fold of 4-bp stem/-3-bp loop; each with a single unpaired C at the 3′-end (see Fig. 2) (25Breslauer K. Frank R. Blocker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). HL14-nb has a five base stem but identical to HL14 except for the two 5′ bases. HL13-nb has a different sequence but also possesses a 4-bp stem/-3-bp loop, and can form an offset dimer or hairpin. HL10 and HL8 form a linear structure only. HL13-nb and HL14-nb lack the unpaired C at the 3′-end, whereas HL14 and HL16 will need to form a bulge or bubble out of one C to form a template from the stem.Table IList of RNA templates used in this workRNASequenceSecondary structureHL8AUGAGACCNoHL10CUAUGAGACCNoHL12GUCUAUGAGACCUAUCUG-5′GAGACC-3′HL13-nbAAGGUUAUGAACCUAUUGGAA-5′GAACC-3′HL14-nbAGGUCUAUGAGACCUAUCUGGA-5′GAGACC-3′HL14AAGUCUAUGAGACCUAUCUGAA-5′GAGACC-3′HL16GCAAGUCUAUGAGACCUAUCUGAACG-5′GAGACC-3′ Open table in a new tab We examined the products catalyzed by the NS5B polymerase 1b-BKΔ55 when incubated with HL templates, pGpG primer, and α-32P-labeled UTP for 30 min at room temperature. A 3-mer RNA product was likely initiated from the two cytidylates at the 3′ terminus serving as the priming site for pGpG; with the UTP base paired to the adjacent adenosine added to the 3′-end yielding the product, pGpGpU. The amount of 3-mer product produced was highest for HL10 and HL8 templates, reduced in amount for HL12, HL14, and HL16 templates (Fig. 1A). The 3-mer band was only seen for HL14-nb and a 4-mer formed for the HL13-nb template upon prolonged exposure of the gel (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Because the HL12 and longer templates can form secondary structure (Fig. 2 and Table I), this could interfere with the ability of pGpG to prime with the 3′-end of these templates. Following this reasoning one would expect HL14-nb, having the lowest free energy for secondary structure, to give lowest amount of a 3-mer product (Fig. 2). However, the free energy for all other templates with secondary structure is similar and should, therefore, all give the same level of 3-mer formation, which was not seen. There were no 3-mer bands observed when templates were incubated with labeled UTP in the absence of pGpG (Fig. 1A), and there were no products observed following incubation of NS5B and labeled UTP in the absence of template (data not shown). While 3-mer was the only product observed for HL8, HL10 and HL12, the other templates, HL13-nb, HL14, HL14-nb and HL16, each generated higher molecular weight bands (Fig. 1A). HL13-nb and HL14-nb gave a band of the same size migrating above 5′ (kinase plus [γ-32P]ATP)-labeled HL14 and below 5′-labeled HL16 (Fig. 1A, lanes 11–14). The product from HL14 template migrated at the same position as the 5′-labeled HL16 (Fig. 1A, lanes 16 and 17), and HL16 gave a band larger than the starting template (Fig. 1A, lanes 19 and 20). In some replicate experiments we observed two high molecular weight bands for the HL14 and HL16 with the upper band migrating at the same position as shown in Fig. 1A and a lower band just above the 5′ (kinase)-labeled template. The discrete bands for these templates, i.e. without significant laddering or higher molecular weight bands, strongly suggested these products were template derived. When the NS5B 1b-BKΔ21 form of the polymerase was used under the same conditions as in Fig. 1A, the level of 3-mer formation, in the presence of pGpG, was very low for all templates (Fig. 1B). However, high molecular weight bands were readily seen for templates HL13-nb and HL14-nb, with products migrating as observed using 1b-BKΔ55 (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). For templates HL14 and HL16 each yielded two faint bands, the upper band migrating at the size seen in Fig. 1A, and the lower band migrating about one base lower (Fig. 1B, lanes 6 and 7). To determine if these higher molecular weight bands were due to template extension of homo-dimer or hairpin, we generated conditions that would disrupt secondary structure of RNA. HL16 was heated above its melting temperature followed by cooling in the absence or presence of an 8-nt primer (5′-GGUCUCAU-3′) complementary to the 3′-end of the HL templates. The annealed and non-annealed HL16 templates were incubated with 1b-BKΔ55 and labeled UTP for 30 min and products analyzed. The HL16 template, pre-annealed with the 8-nt primer, did not give the high molecular weight bands (Fig. 1C, lane 2), whereas HL16, heated in the absence of 8-nt primer, gave the same size of high molecular weight bands seen in A and B of Fig. 1 (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Thus, formation of high molecular weight bands appears dependent upon the secondary structure of the template. T+n Generation—Because all templates with secondary structure and at least one free 5′ A gave the higher molecular weight bands, it is likely this occurs by the enzyme utilizing the stem region of dimer or hairpin as template (Fig. 2). Template extension would require enzyme binding to the double-stranded region and addition of labeled UTP to the 3′ C. For HL14-nb one incoming UTP base pairs with the 5′-adenylate and forms a phosphodiester bond with the 3′-cytidylate (Fig. 2). A time course for HL14-nb revealed rapid accumulation of the 15-mer with an exponential rate of 0.015/s and ∼45 s of incubation to generate the half-maximal amount of product (Fig. 3A). For HL13-nb two nucleotides were incorporated yielding a 15-mer with the same exponential rate, 0.015/s, seen for adding one nucleotide to HL14-nb; ∼45 s was also the time required to generate half of the final level of product (Fig. 3B). Differences in rate were seen when templates with secondary structure and containing the unpaired C at the 3′-end were used. Utilizing HL14 as the template resulted in the rapid appearance of the T+1 band, followed by the generation of a T+2 band, which co-migrated with the kinase labeled HL16 marker (Fig. 3C). The time required to generate half of the final level of T+2 was ∼4 min, and the exponential rate for T+2 generation from HL14 was 0.003/s. The timed reaction demonstrates that there is a rapid addition of one nucleotide, and formation of a 15-mer with an exponential rate of 0.01/s. However, the addition of the second UMP was much slower. The addition of two UTPs to HL13-nb appears to occur as one step; the addition to HL14 (or HL16 data not shown) appears to occur in a two-step process. Nucleotide addition to the existing 3′-end-generating T+1 product was followed by generation of the T+2 product or 16 mer (Fig. 3C). In the absence of the stem region from hairpin or dimer a high molecular weight product was not observed for HL8 (Fig. 3D). The initial rate of 3-mer production, for HL8 template and pGpG primer, was 0.015/s, similar to that seen for nucleotide addition (T+1) to the templates with secondary structure (Fig. 3). About 45 s was required to generate half the maximal level of 3-mer product observed (Fig. 3D). Products from Labeled Template—Experiments described to this point were performed in the presence of unlabeled RNA template and radiolabeled substrate ([α-32P]UTP). To directly observe the amount of template modified and to examine the T+1 and T+2 sequence for higher molecular weight bands for templates with the 3′ mismatch, the HL templates were 5′-end-labeled ([γ-32P] plus kinase) and used as the template for either 1b-BKΔ21 or 1b-BKΔ55 in the presence/absence of pGpG primer and cold UTP (detailed under “Experimental Procedures”). The size of the starting template HL14 and HL16 is shown in lanes 1 and 2 of Fig. 4. Consistent with data in Figs. 1 and 3, the initial template shifted up one or two nucleotides in size generating T+1 and T+2 for the HL14 and an apparent T+1 and T+2 for the HL16 template (Fig. 4). The T+2 size of the product was consistent with NS5B binding to the template stem and adding two UTPs to the 3′-end by base pairing with the two adenosines. Template elongation by both forms of NS5B for stem-containing templates did not depend upon the presence of pGpG primer (Fig. 4). The 1b-BKΔ55 polymerase converted about 85% of the HL14 template to a T+2 product with the remainder divided between the starting template and T+1 product (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 9). The 1b-BKΔ55 catalyzed about 50% of the HL16-labeled template to the T+2 product with very little T+1 product and about 50% unmodified template (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 10). The NS5B 1b-BKΔ21 form of the enzyme was much less active, converting the HL14 template to a low level of T+1 and very low level to the T+2 form (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 7) and with the HL16 template only a very small amount of the T+1 product was observed (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 8). The lower production of T+2 for 1b-BKΔ21 is consistent with the lower specific activity seen for BK Δ21 versus Δ55 with homopolymeric templates. 2C. Lima, X. Jiang, S. Swanberg, C. Liu, and S.
