https://openalex.org/W2046597617,"Combinations of phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon were added to several small lakes in northwestern Ontario, Canada, at rates similar to those in many culturally eutrophied lakes. Phosphate and nitrate caused rapid eutrophication. A similar result was obtained with phosphate, ammonia, and sucrose, but recovery was almost immediate when phosphate additions only were discontinued. When two basins of one lake were fertilized with equal amounts of nitrate and sucrose, and phosphorus was also added to one of the basins, the phosphateenriched basin quickly became highly eutrophic, while the basin receiving only nitrogen and carbon remained at prefertilization conditions. These results, and the high affinity of sediments for phosphorus indicate that rapid abatement of eutrophication may be expected to follow phosphorus control measures."

The reduction proceeds via first order kinetics (rate constant, 0.009 hour-(1)) and is depndent on pH. The reaction mechanism involves interaction of the ionic metal species with the free radical electrons of the humic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2077334075,"The probable range of seepage into the marine environment is 0.2 x 10(6) to 6.0 x 10(6) metric tons per year. Within this range the best estimate for the present marine seepage worldwide is on the order of 0.6 x 10(6) metric tons per year. This estimate is based on the presumption that only a few other areas around the world are as seepage-prone as southern California. Measurements of seeps and seepage rates are too few to allow an accurate estimation by observation and measurement techniques alone. Seepage potential can, however, be related to geologic criteria, and these provide sound bases for marine seepage assessment. On the basis of this estimate, areas of high seepage potential contribute about 45 percent of the worldwide seepage, areas of moderate seepage about 55 percent, and areas of low seepage less than 1 percent. The situation varies somewhat from ocean to ocean. In the Pacific Ocean, areas of high seep potential are by far the major contributors. In the Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, and Southern oceans, areas of moderate seep potential are most significant because areas of high seep potential are relatively rare in these realnis. The circum-Pacific area is the area of greatest seepage; it contributes about 40 percent of the world's total."

The silicon-silicon double bond resembles in many ways the well-known carbon-carbon double bond of organic chemistry. However, striking dissimilarities are also found between disilenes and alkenes in both their structures and chemical reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2042847836,Speleothems from continental North American caves have been dated by means of the (230)Th/(234)U method. Oxygen isotopic variations in the dated samples and phases of speleothem deposition can be interpreted in terms of climatic change. A glacial chronology constructed from the age and isotopic data lends support to the astronomical theory of climatic change.
https://openalex.org/W2044669860,"Scanning electron microscope techniques show that Eocene opaline claystones (fuller's earth and buhrstone) of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain, deposits long considered volcanic in origin, are actually highly altered diatomites formed as transgressive facies in normal marine continental shelf environmnents. These findings are in agreement with a biogenic origin for time-equivalent horizon A and A deep-sea cherts of the North Atlantic and Caribbean."

https://openalex.org/W2012711599,"Shoreline erosion along man-made lakes in North Dakota and South Dakota has led to the discovery of stratified preceramic cultural remains in an area where previously few such materials have been found. One important exposure, the Walth Bay site, contains a 7000-year sequence of alluvial and eolian deposition capping an abandoned Missouri River terrace. Three distinct soil profiles are associated with successive Late Paleo-Indian, Plains Archaic, and Plains Village Tradition occupations."

https://openalex.org/W2034839752,"The occultation of the star Beta Scorpii by Jupiter was observed at high time resolution in three wavelength channels. The results imply a temperature of 220 degrees K at an altitude in the Jovian atmosphere corresponding to 10(14) molecules per cubic centimeter, and temperature fluctuations of 2 degrees to 10 degrees K over vertical scales of 2 to 10 kilometers. They suggest that the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient near the turbopause has a lower limit of 7 x 10(5)K square centimeters per second, and that the turbopause lies above the altitude where the density is 5 x 10(13) molecules per cubic centimeter. Below the turbopause, the ratio of hydrogen to helium is consistent with cosmic abundances."
