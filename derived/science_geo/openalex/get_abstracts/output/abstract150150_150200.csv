To characterize the molecular mechanisms that regulate osteogenic differentiation, we examined the contribution of mitogen-activated protein kinase family members, ERK, JNK, and p38. Treatment of these stem cells with osteogenic supplements resulted in a sustained phase of ERK activation from day 7 to day 11 that coincided with differentiation, before decreasing to basal levels. Activation of JNK occurred much later (day 13 to day 17) in the osteogenic differentiation process. This JNK activation was associated with extracellular matrix synthesis and increased calcium deposition, the two hallmarks of bone formation. Inhibition of ERK activation by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of the ERK signaling pathway, blocked the osteogenic differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, as did transfection with a dominant negative form of MAP kinase kinase (MEK-1). Significantly, the blockage of osteogenic differentiation resulted in the adipogenic differentiation of the stem cells and the expression of adipose-specific mRNAs peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2, aP2, and lipoprotein lipase. These observations provide a potential mechanism involving MAP kinase activation in osteogenic differentiation of adult stem cells and suggest that commitment of hMSCs into osteogenic or adipogenic lineages is governed by activation or inhibition of ERK, respectively.

The hMSCs do not differentiate spontaneously, and their in vitro and in vivoosteogenic potential has been very well characterized by us and others (4.Jaiswal N. Haynesworth S.E. Caplan A.I.

When cultured in the presence of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, ascorbic acid, and β-glycerophosphate (osteogenic supplements, OS), hMSCs differentiate to the osteogenic lineage, producing bone-like nodules with a mineralized extracellular matrix containing hydroxyapatite (4.Jaiswal N. Haynesworth S.E. Caplan A.I. Bruder S.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1817) Google Scholar). The similar developmental phenomenon has also been described by others (7.Cheng S.-L. Yang J.W. Rifas L. Zhang S.-F. Avioli L.V. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 8.Rickard D.J. Kassem M. Hefferan T.E. Sarkar G. Spelsberg T.C. Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) using bone marrow-derived cells. Other than the osteoinductive effect that OS has on MSCs, OS also acts as a mitogen (9.Bruder S.P. Jaiswal N. Haynesworth S.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 278-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Presumably, the osteoinductive and mitogenic effects are due to dexamethasone present in OS because glucocorticoids are potent regulators of cellular growth and differentiation (10.Lukert B.P. Raisz L.G. Ann. Intern. Med. 1990; 112: 352-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of OS-induced mitogenic and osteogenic differentiation are presently unknown.In order to acquire a new cell phenotype, uncommitted hMSCs must undergo proliferative and differentiative changes, the two most fundamental biological processes in the life cycle of cells. One of the potential signal transduction pathways that might regulate the proliferation and differentiation of hMSCs is the MAP kinase pathway. Activation of the MAP kinase pathway in other cell types such as neuronal cells, adipocytes, T-cells, and muscle cells promotes cell differentiation (11.Lowry D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 12.Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol.

Most recently, a role for MAP kinase in chondrogenesis of limb bud mesenchyme has also been demonstrated (13.Chang S-H. Oh C.-D. Yang M.-S. Kang S.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19213-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The first discovered members of the MAP kinase family, ERK1 and ERK2 (extracellular signal-regulatedkinase), which were first identified by Ray and Sturgill (14.Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), are predominantly activated by growth factors via a Ras-dependent signal transduction pathway (15.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). ERKs are activated by dual phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues separated by a glutamate residue (TEY) by a single upstream kinase known as MEK (MAP kinase or ERKkinase). Other than growth factors, hormones such as estrogen and parathyroid hormone, which have a profound effect on bone development and remodeling, will also transiently activate ERK1 in MCF-7 cells and ERK2 in the osteosarcoma cell line UMR 106-01 (16.Migliaccio A.

Angel P. Partridge N.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12 (abstr.): 5162Google Scholar). Activation of ERK1/ERK2 has also been demonstrated as an important signaling mechanism in the differentiation of the preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 into mature adipocytes (18.Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G.P. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The ERK phosphorylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which is a key component of transcription machinery of adipogenic differentiation and selectively expressed in adipocytes, in vitro as well asin vivo, results in reduction of PPARγ transcriptional activity (19.Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 20.Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Growth factors and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, which activate MAP kinases (21.Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 22.Cobb M. Hepler J.E. Cheng M. Robbins D. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 4: 261-268Google Scholar), are potent inhibitors of adipocyte differentiation (23.Serrero G. Mills D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3912-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24.Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Larrick J.W. Ringold G.M. J.

The relationship between MAP kinases and adipogenesis is further strengthened by the recent demonstration that leptin, product of the ob gene, induced activation of MAP kinase in mouse embryonic cell line C3H10T1/2 (26.Takahashi Y. Okimura Y. Mizuno I. Iida K. Takahashi T. Kaji H. Abe H. Chihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12897-12900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Leptin-induced MAP kinase activation may cause a reduction in the adipogenic differentiation by phosphorylating PPARγ and thus might play an important role in controlling adipogenesis.Recently, two new members of the MAP kinase family have been described as follows: the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), also known as stress-activated protein kinase, and p38-reactivating kinase (p38 RK or simply, p38). These kinases can be activated by a variety of cytokines, environmental stress, as well as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation (27.Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 438-443Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-β stimulates ERK (28.Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as well as p38 (29.Hannigan M. Zhan L. Huang C.K. Biochem, Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and acts as a physiological regulator of osteoblast differentiation and bone remodeling by regulating and coordinating the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts (30.Erlebacher A. Filvoroff E.H. Ye J.Q. Derynck R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 7: 1903-1918Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6, which are important regulators of bone resorption, activate JNK and p38 in human and mouse osteoblastic cells (31.Chaudhary L.R. Avioli L.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 78: 59-68Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32.Blanque R. Cottereaux C. Gardner C.R. Drug Exp. Clin. Res. 1997; 23: 63-70PubMed Google Scholar).Despite the rapid progress in the elucidation of the signaling pathways involving MAP kinases, the most crucial question of how the specificity and integration of multiple signals are processed in parallel remains unanswered. In the present study, we demonstrate that activation of MAP kinases in hMSCs, cultured in OS medium, resulted in their differentiation into osteocytes and that inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway by PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor (33.Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), caused these cells to develop into fully mature adipocytes. These results provide a potential mechanism of action for ERK in regulating the lineage commitment of multipotential adult stem cells. These results may also have important clinical implications during the aging process or diseases, such as osteoporosis, where bone marrow stroma is progressively replaced by fat (34.Meunier P. Aaron J. Edouard C. Vignon G. Clin. Orthop. 1971; 80: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONAlthough activation of the MAP kinase signaling cascade has been associated with many different cellular signaling events, there is little previous evidence implicating this pathway in differentiation of hMSCs into osteoblasts. In the present study, we investigated the differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts through regulation of MAP kinases. We found that differentiation in osteoinductive culture medium strongly activated ERK2, JNK2, and p38 in a time-dependent manner. Although ERK1 and ERK2 were both expressed at similar protein levels, ERK2 was strongly activated by phosphorylation during differentiation. The ERK pathway regulates two mutually antagonistic processes, cellular proliferation and cellular differentiation. Stimulation of MAP kinase by fluoride has been shown to lead to the potentiation of bone cell proliferation (63.Lau K. Baylink D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1660-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that differentiation of cells requires sustained activation of ERK, whereas transient activation of ERK leads to proliferation (15.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). The division of hMSCs does not appear to be stimulated by exposure to dexamethasone alone. In fact, the addition of OS to human marrow stromal cells has been shown to inhibit proliferation while promoting osteogenic differentiation (7.Cheng S.-L. Yang J.W. Rifas L. Zhang S.-F. Avioli L.V. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). This observation, combined with other evidence of differentiation occurring as early as 2 days after OS treatment (47.Jaiswal, N., and Bruder, S. P. (1996) J. Bone Mineral Res. 259Google Scholar), implies that the requirement of sustained ERK2 activation fosters continued lineage progression and furthers osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, sustained activation of ERK2 between days 7 and 10 is correlated with up-regulation of osteopontin expression, matrix deposition, and initiation of mineralization (48.Bruder S.P. Jaiswal N. Ricalton N.S. Kraus K.H. Kadiyala S. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1998; 355: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Based on the requirement for sustained ERK2 activation, we suggest the possibility that the ERK signaling pathway is involved in the establishment of an autocrine signaling loop, contributing to the accumulation of a factor responsible for hMSC differentiation. Further efforts to characterize the precise cell cycle dynamics in relation to addition of OS, the nature of the factors involved, and acquisition of the osteoblastic phenotype will help to clarify the role of MAP kinases in this osteogenesis system.The requirement for the MAP kinase pathway for osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs was tested by the use of a specific inhibitor of MEK1, PD98059, and the introduction of a dominant negative MEK1 isoform into hMSCs. The PD98059 compound selectively blocks the activity of MEK1 and the subsequent activation of ERKs in a variety of intact cells (33.Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 41.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). Additionally, the use of a dominant negative MEK1 expression plasmid, which avoids any drug-related pleiotropic effects, confirmed a specific role for the MEK1 signaling pathway. Our results demonstrated that inhibition of ERK activation paralleled the reduction in alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition, suggesting a regulatory role of ERK in osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs and osteogenesis. Moreover, the introduction of a constitutively active form of MEK1 into the hMSCs resulted in increased AP activity and calcium deposition (Fig. 8, B and C). In addition to ERK2, OS-induced differentiation also stimulated JNK, and p38 as well, albeit at later time points. Although the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases are structurally related and have similar kinase cascade patterns, they are activated by different extracellular stimuli (49.Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) and have distinct substrate specificities (21.Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 51.Cobb M.J. Robbins D.J. Boulton T.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These differences could explain the temporal relationship of kinase activation seen in the results, which reveal that these kinases are activated at different times and likely regulate distinct biological functions required in osteogenesis, such as commitment, differentiation, and maturation. Growth factor-stimulated activation of the ERK signaling pathway is required for proliferation and differentiation, whereas stimulation of p38 and JNK signaling pathways can contribute to other cellular processes, including cell death (52.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). Different types of stress such as physical strain (stretch) and hyperosmolarity generated by progressive accumulation and calcification of soft extracellular matrix around the differentiated osteoblasts and during nodule formation could lead to stimulation of p38 and JNK. Physiological calcification of soft extracellular matrix occurs in bone as it is converted into a rigid material capable of supporting mechanical force (53.Gehron-Robey P. Bianco P. Termine J.D. Coe F.L. Favus M.J. Disorders of Mineral Metabolism. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 241-263Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that apoptosis occurs in heavily mineralized cultures in and around mature nodule areas during osteogenesis (40.Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein VanWijen J.L. Frenkel B. Montecino M. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 69-86Google Scholar).The osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived stromal cells, and cells isolated from human trabecular bone have been characterized extensively; however, the regulatory mechanism(s) responsible remain unidentified. The lineage potentiality of these cells depends upon factors as diverse as 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (54.Nuttall M.E. Patton A.J. Olivera D.L. Nadeau D.P. Gowen M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and BMPs (55.Chen D. Ji X. Harris M.A. Feng J.Q. Karsenty G. Celeste A.J. Rosen V. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), as well as cell passage number (59.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Based upon our finding of the inverse regulation of osteogenesis and adipogenesis by MAP kinase in hMSCs, we suggest a role for ERK as a regulatory switch for these differentiation pathways.Many growth factors and cytokines that activate MAP kinases also inhibit adipose differentiation in culture or in vivo (56.Beresford J.N. Bennett J.H. Devlin C. Leboy P.S. Owen M.E. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 341-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,57.Hauner H. Rohrig K. Petruschke Y. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 25: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). At the transcriptional level, two families of factors control adipogenesis as follows: PPARs and C/EBPs, members of the nuclear hormone receptor family (46.Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Among the three PPAR isoforms, α, δ, and γ, PPARγ is responsible for the initiation and maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype in vivo (58.Navre M. Ringold G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The specific ligands that bind to PPARγ, including antidiabetic thiazolidinediones, and prostaglandin J2, induce a strong adipogenic response in hMSCs.2 PPARγ possesses a MAP kinase phosphorylation consensus sequence at the N terminus which is phosphorylated when growth factors known to activate MAP kinases interact with surface receptors (19.Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 20.Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 59.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PPARγ decreases its transcriptional activities and thus contributes to the anti-adipogenic effects of these agents. Most of these studies were performed using pre-adipocytic cell lines and demonstrated that PPARγ acts as a master conductor of the entire adipogenic program. However, the potent activators of PPARs such as thiazolidinedione or 2-bromopalmitate that induce a potent adipogenic differentiation in preadipocytic cells could not commit multipotential embryonic stem cells into the adipogenic lineage (60.Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that PPARγ does not play its critical role alone in the initial steps of adipose cell commitment and development from a multipotent stem cell. There are likely other factors that play an important role in the early stages of initiating adipogenic programming. To decipher the molecular mechanism will require further work, preferably in a serum-free system.To our knowledge, this is the first report that the switch from osteogenesis to adipogenesis is regulated by ERK in hMSCs. However, the relevant downstream targets of ERK still remain unknown at present. Whereas activation of ERK correlates with proliferation and initial differentiation, the activation of p38 and JNK likely plays a role in later cellular differentiation or, in the end stage, apoptosis. The presence of multiple MAP kinase signal transduction pathways and the extent to which each is activated during differentiation may reflect the integration of multiple signals and the balance among ERK, p38, and JNK MAP kinases.Human bone marrow contains a variety of cell types including hMSCs, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, blood progenitor cells, stromal cells, and adipocytes. Under normal conditions there is a balance between osteoblasts and adipocytes in bone marrow. However, this balance is lost in diseases such as osteoporosis and osteopenia where a decrease in bone volume is accompanied by an increase in adipose tissue. One mechanism for the decrease could be imbalance in differentiation of hMSCs into osteoblastic and adipocytic lineages at the expense of the osteoblasts. The precise molecular mechanism for this imbalance is presently unknown, and the interrelationship between adipocytes and bone formation is an area of active research. The present studies suggest a vital role of ERK1/2 in balancing the differentiation of osteoblastic and adipogenic lineages from a common progenitor (hMSCs) and are directly relevant to the understanding of the mechanism of osteoporosis. Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)1 are multipotent, capable of differentiating into at least three lineages (osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic) when cultured under defined in vitro conditions (1.Bruder S.P.

Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). ERKs are activated by dual phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues separated by a glutamate residue (TEY) by a single upstream kinase known as MEK (MAP kinase or ERKkinase). Other than growth factors, hormones such as estrogen and parathyroid hormone, which have a profound effect on bone development and remodeling, will also transiently activate ERK1 in MCF-7 cells and ERK2 in the osteosarcoma cell line UMR 106-01 (16.Migliaccio A.

The rapid storage of carbon by the land biosphere from 1991 to 1997 contrasts with the 1980s, when the land biosphere was approximately neutral. Comparison with measurements of delta13CO2 implies an isotopic flux of 89 +/- 21 gigatons of carbon per mil per year, in agreement with model- and inventory-based estimates of this flux. Both the delta13C and the O2 data show significant interannual variability in carbon storage over the period of record. The general agreement of the independent estimates from O2 and delta13C is a robust signal of variable carbon uptake by both the land biosphere and the oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2073305956,"Multilayer mirrors that maintain or increase their reflectivity with increasing incidence angle can be constructed using polymers that exhibit large birefringence in their indices of refraction. The most important feature of these multilayer interference stacks is the index difference in the thickness direction ( z axis) relative to the in-plane directions of the film. This z -axis refractive index difference provides a variable that determines the existence and value of the Brewster's angle at layer interfaces, and it controls both the interfacial Fresnel reflection coefficient and the phase relations that determine the optics of multilayer stacks. These films can yield optical results that are difficult or impossible to achieve with conventional multilayer optical designs. The materials and processes necessary to fabricate such films are amenable to large-scale manufacturing."
https://openalex.org/W1983301443,"We have detected changes in the rotation of the sun near the base of its convective envelope, including a prominent variation with a period of 1.3 years at low latitudes. Such helioseismic probing of the deep solar interior has been enabled by nearly continuous observation of its oscillation modes with two complementary experiments. Inversion of the global-mode frequency splittings reveals that the largest temporal changes in the angular velocity Omega are of the order of 6 nanohertz and occur above and below the tachocline that separates the sun's differentially rotating convection zone (outer 30% by radius) from the nearly uniformly rotating deeper radiative interior beneath. Such changes are most pronounced near the equator and at high latitudes and are a substantial fraction of the average 30-nanohertz difference in Omega with radius across the tachocline at the equator. The results indicate variations of rotation close to the presumed site of the solar dynamo, which may generate the 22-year cycles of magnetic activity."

The Bloom's syndrome gene product, BLM, belongs to the RecQ family of DNA helicases, which also includes the human Werner's and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome gene products and the Sgs1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This family shows strong evolutionary conservation of protein structure and function. Previous studies have shown that Sgs1p interacts both physically and genetically with topoisomerase III. Here, we have investigated whether this interaction has been conserved in human cells. We show that BLM and hTOPO IIIα, one of two human topoisomerase III homologues, co-localize in the nucleus of human cells and can be co-immunoprecipitated from human cell extracts. Moreover, the purified BLM and hTOPO IIIα proteins are able to bind specifically to each other in vitro, indicating that the interaction is direct. We have mapped two independent domains on BLM that are important for mediating the interaction with hTOPO IIIα. Furthermore, through characterizing a genetic interaction betweenBLM and TOP3 in S. cerevisiae, we have identified a functional role for the hTOPO IIIα interaction domains in BLM.

Medicine. 1993; 72: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Cells from affected individuals show genomic instability, the hallmark feature being hyperrecombination between sister chromatids. The gene mutated in Bloom's syndrome,BLM, encodes a member of the RecQ family of DEXH box DNA helicases (2.Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). This family of helicases has been conserved from bacteria to humans, and all members share a central core domain comprising seven highly conserved motifs found in all known DNA helicases (3.Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition to BLM, there are at least four other human RecQ homologs. Defects in two of these, WRN and RECQL4, are also associated with disease conditions (4.Yu C. Oshima J. Fu Y. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Najura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M.

Genet. 1999; 22: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). WRN is the gene mutated in the premature aging disorder Werner's syndrome, andRECQL4 is mutated in Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, a rare condition associated with skin and skeletal abnormalities, as well as some features of premature aging (6.Vennos E.M. James W.D. Dermatologic Clinics. 1995; 13: 143-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like Bloom's syndrome, both of these diseases also give rise to an elevated incidence of cancer, although to a lesser extent than is seen in Bloom's syndrome. In eukaryotes, the RecQ helicase family can be divided into two subfamilies: those that consist of essentially the helicase domain and those in which the helicase domain is flanked by large, poorly conserved N- and C-terminal domains (3.Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). BLM falls into the latter class, along with WRN and RECQL4, as well as theSchizosaccharomyces pombe Rqh1 (7.Stewart E. Chapman C.R. Al-Khodairy F. Carr A.M. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1 proteins (8.Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell.

In addition to structural homology, there exists a certain degree of conservation of function among the various eukaryotic RecQ helicases. For example, Sgs1p, BLM and WRN display 3′–5′ DNA helicase activity, suggesting that they share a similar mechanism of action (10.Bennett R.J. Sharp J.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol.

Moreover, the hyperrecombination phenotype of sgs1mutants can be partially suppressed by ectopic expression of either BLM or WRN (16.Yamagata K. Kato J. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Ikeda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8733-8738Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The torsional stress introduced into DNA when the complementary strands are separated by helicases is relieved by a class of enzymes known as topoisomerases. These enzymes catalyze the passage of intact DNA strands across transient DNA breaks and fall into one of two classes, designated type I and type II, depending upon their mechanism of action. Type I topoisomerases generate single-stranded DNA nicks, whereas type II topoisomerases make double-stranded DNA breaks (17.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar,18.Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence to suggest that the RecQ helicases act in concert with one member of the type I class, topoisomerase III.S. cerevisiae expresses a single topoisomerase III enzyme encoded by the TOP3 gene (19.Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). top3Δ mutants grow very slowly, display hyperrecombination between repetitive sequences throughout the genome, and have defects in meiotic recombination (8.Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 20.Gangloff S. de Massy B. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Fabre F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1701-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mutations in SGS1 partially suppress the pleiotropic effects of top3 mutations, suggesting that Sgs1p and Top3p act in the same pathway (8.Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Moreover, Sgs1p and Top3p interact physically and may, therefore, act in a coordinated manner as a heterodimeric or larger complex (8.Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). What role such a complex plays in the cell is unclear. Harmon et al. (21.Harmon F.G. DiGate R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) have shown thatE. coli RecQ and topo III together can catalyze the linking and unlinking of covalently closed circular DNA molecules, and it has been suggested that such an activity may function in suppressing recombination. In mammals, two topoisomerase III homologues, TOPO IIIα and TOPO IIIβ, have been identified (22.Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23.Kawasaki K. Minoshima S. Nakato E. Shibuya K. Shintani A. Schmeits J.L. Wany J. Shimizu N.

Both of these enzymes can relax negatively supercoiled DNA, and TOPO IIIα has been shown to be essential for embryonic development in mice (22.Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24.Seki T. Seki M. Onodera R. Katada T. Enomoto T. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Human TOPO IIIβ (hTOPO IIIβ) is able to interact physically with Sgs1p when expressed in S. cerevisiae (26.Ng S.W. Liu Y. Hasselblatt K.T. Mok S.C. Berkowitz R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction between RecQ helicases and topoisomerase III enzymes has been conserved between eukaryotic species. In this study, we have examined the possibility that BLM acts in concert with one of the human TOPO III isozymes. Purified BLM and hTOPO IIIα proteins were found to interact directly, and this association was mediated by two regions located in the N- and C-terminal domains of BLM that can independently bind hTOPO IIIα. BLM was also found to genetically interact with yeast TOP3, and this interaction was shown to require the presence of either one of the two hTOPO IIIα interaction domains. The SV40-transformed normal human fibroblast cell line, WI-38/VA-13, which was obtained from the ATCC, was used as a representative of a human cell line from a normal individual. The GM08505 cell line is an SV40-transformed fibroblast cell line from a Bloom's syndrome patient (obtained from NIGMS, National Institutes of Health) and contains a BLM homozygous frameshift mutation resulting in premature truncation of the protein at position 739 (2.Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). PSNB2 cells were derived from a clone of GM08505 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3/BLM, an expression construct containing the full-length BLM cDNA downstream of the CMV promoter. The derivation and characterization of these cells will be described in detail elsewhere. 1P. S. North et al., manuscript in preparation. All three cell lines were routinely cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa S3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The E. coli BL21(DE3) strain was obtained from NEB. Gene disruptions were done in the S. cerevisiae YP-1 strain (his4-R leu2 MATa-URA3-MATa ura3–52 ade2–101 lys2). The SGS1 open reading frame was replaced with LYS2 as described previously (15.Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Borts R.H. Louis E.J. Genetics. 1996; 144: 935-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TOP3 open reading frame was replaced with akanMX cassette using the method of Wach et al.(27.Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on plates containing G418, and the disruption of TOP3 was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).2 The entire BLM open reading frame was cloned between the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3/BLM. pMAL-C2 (New England Biolabs) and pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) plasmids were used for the generation of maltose-binding protein (MBP) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion peptides, respectively. Portions of the BLM cDNA that encoded various N- and C-terminal regions of BLM were amplified by PCR. Sense and antisense primers contained the seven terminal 5′ sense and 3′ antisense codons, respectively, of each desired fragment. The antisense primer had an additional in-frame antisense stop codon.EcoRI and XhoI sites were also engineered into the sense and antisense primers, respectively, to allow in-frame cloning of the PCR fragments into pMAL-C2 and pGEX-4T-1. pBLM-N, pBLM-C, and pBLM-NC contained residues 213–1417, 1–1265, and 213–1265 of BLM, respectively, and were generated by modification of pJK1, which comprises the entire BLM open reading frame with an additional 18 nucleotides encoding a C-terminal hexahistidine tag cloned into pYES (12.Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To generate the N-terminal deletion, PCR was used to amplify a 0.7-kb fragment from the BLM cDNA using the 5′ primer BLMN6 (5′-GAGAGGTACCTAACCATGTCTGAAAGCGAGCAAATAGA-3′) and the 3′ primer BLMN7 (5′-TTCATAGAATTCCCTGTAGG-3′). The BLMN6 primer contains a unique KpnI site (underlined) and Kozak sequence in which the ATG is in-frame with Ser-213 of the BLM gene (boldface). The 0.7-kb PCR fragment contains the uniqueEcoRI site in pJK1 located at nucleotide position 1341 in the BLM cDNA. The BLMN6/7 PCR fragment was digested withKpnI and EcoRI and used to replace the single 1.4-kb KpnI/EcoRI fragment from pJK1 to generate pBLM-N. To generate the C-terminal deletion, PCR was used to amplify a 0.5-kb fragment from the BLM cDNA using the 5′ primer BLMC20 (5′-TGTAGGTCCTTCTGGAAGAT-3′) and the 3′ primer BLMC21 (5′-GAGATCTAGATCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGACCATCAA TTTGAAGCAAAA-3′). The BLMC21 primer contains a unique XbaI site (underlined) and a stretch of 18 nucleotides (boldface) that encodes a hexahistidine tag in-frame to Gly-1265 of BLM. The 0.5-kb PCR fragment contains the unique SalI site in pJK1 located at nucleotide position 3343 of the BLM cDNA. The BLMC20/21 PCR fragments were each digested with SalI andXbaI and used to replace the single 1-kbSalI/XbaI fragment in pJK1 and pBLM-N, to generate pBLM-C and pBLM-NC, respectively. For the production of the IHIC33 anti-BLM antibody, rabbits were immunized with six 100-μg injections of an MBP fusion peptide containing residues 1–449 of BLM. The serum was then affinity-purified against the MBP/BLM (1–449) protein. Several mg of the MBP fusion peptide was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-ECL filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were then incubated with 2 ml of serum overnight at 4 °C before being washed four times for 10 min each in TBS. Anti-BLM antibodies were eluted in 1 ml of 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, for 5 min at 20 °C and neutralized by the addition of 675 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. A monoclonal antibody specific for BLM recombinant BLM was raised in Balb/C mice, following immunization with 10 μg of full-length recombinant BLM (28.Karow J.K. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 597-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fusions were carried out using standard methods (29.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 139-244Google Scholar). Supernatants were screened by antibody capture on multiwell plates coated with recombinant BLM. An antiserum, designated BFL-103, was chosen for study and will be described in detail elsewhere. 3H. Turley et al., manuscript in preparation. The D6 antibody specific for hTOPO IIIα was raised in New Zealand White rabbits by subcutaneous injection of eight injections of 100 μg each of purified recombinant hTOPO IIIα. The antiserum was used without further purification. pcDNA3 containing the entire open reading frame of either hTOPO IIIα or hTOPO IIIβ was used in the TNT coupled reticulocyte system containing [35S]methionine, following the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). Half of each reaction was then boiled and separated by SDS-PAGE before being subjected to either autoradiography or Western blotting. Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 250 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 20 min. After 3–5 washes over 20 min in PBSA, cells were permeabalized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min and then washed as before. Blocking in 5% fetal bovine serum in PBSA was followed by 16 h incubation with the primary antibodies BFL-103, IHIC33, or D6, which were used at a 1:50, 1:200, and 1:200 dilution, respectively. 3–5 PBSA washes over 20 min were followed by incubating for a further 30 min with anti-mouse Cy3 (Sigma) or anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (Dako) secondary antibody diluted to 1/800 and 1/200 respectively. Cells were washed five times in PBSA, and the DNA was stained using Hoechst 33258 at 50 ng/ml. Stained slides were mounted in 90% glycerol, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 50 μg/ml paraphenylenediamine. Slides were viewed at × 100 magnification on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Image acquisition and analysis were performed using Kromascan (Kinetic Imaging), and the images were pseudocolored and merged in Adobe Photoshop. Nuclear extracts were prepared from exponentially growing HeLa S3 cells. Approximately 108 cells were washed in PBSA and the pellet lysed in 5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm PMSF) on ice for 45 min. The nuclei were then harvested at 5000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was then suspended in 0.15 ml of TKM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, and 1 mm PMSF) to which 15 μl of 0.2m EDTA, pH 8.0, and 2 volumes of Buffer D (80 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.53 mNaCl, 20% glycerol supplemented with 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), used at the manufacturer's recommended concentration), were added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. The nuclear extract was then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatant stored at −70 °C. Whole cell extracts were typically prepared from 2 liters of exponentially growing HeLa S3 cultures. After rinsing of cells in cold PBSA, the cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm glucose 1-phosphate, 10 nm microcystin, 0.1 mm para-nitrophenylphosphate, 1 mm PMSF, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), used at the manufacturer's recommended concentration), for 5 min at 4 °C. The lysate was then cleared by centrifugation at 5000 ×g at 4 °C for 5 min and used on the day of preparation. Typically, whole cell extracts prepared from 300 ml of exponentially growing HeLa S3 cells were used for each immunoprecipitation. D6 or IHIC33 antibody was added to the extract to give a 1:50 dilution and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Antibody was captured by adding to each sample 100 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) in whole cell extract lysis buffer. Samples were then rotated end-over-end for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were pelleted in a benchtop microcentrifuge for 5 s at 14,000 rpm and washed in 1 ml of cold whole cell extract lysis buffer. The pellet was washed a further four times before being boiled in sample loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm DTT, 2% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) for 5 min. Samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond-ECL filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a TE 70 semi-dry transfer unit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). BLM and hTOPO IIIα were detected by conventional Western analysis using 1:500 dilutions of IHIC33 or D6 as primary antibody, respectively. Anti-rabbit IgG/horse radish peroxidase conjugates (Sigma) were used as secondary antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution and detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant BLM and hTOPOIIIα were expressed and purified as described previously (12.Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol.

MBP and GST fusion peptides were expressed and purified from BL21 (DE3) cells (New England Biolabs) transformed with the pMAL-C2 or pGEX-4T-1 expression plasmids containing various portions of the BLM cDNA. Overnight cultures of transformants inoculated into 400 ml of LB at a 1:100 dilution were grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.5–0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cultures were allowed to grow for a further 2–3 h before being chilled on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm in a Beckman JA10 rotor, the cell pellet was resupended in 10 ml of PBSA supplemented with 1 mm PMSF and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at the manufacturer's recommended concentration. Cells were then lysed by sonication, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 42,000 rpm in a Beckman 70 TI rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. 1 ml of 50% slurries of amylose-agarose (NEB) or GSH-agarose resin (Sigma) were then added to the lysates to capture MBP or GST fusion proteins, respectively, and rotated end-over-end for 30 min at 4 °C. The agarose resin was then pelleted in a benchtop microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 s and washed with 1 ml of cold PBSA. The resin was washed a further four times before being boiled in sample loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm DTT, 2% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) for 5 min. Typically, 0.2–1.0 μg of each polypeptide was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-ECL filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a TE 70 semidry transfer unit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), after which all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Filters were immersed twice in denaturation buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl in PBSA) for 10 min and then incubated six times for 10 min each in serial dilutions (1:1) of denaturation buffer supplemented with 1 mm DTT. Filters were blocked in TBS containing 10% powdered milk, 0.3% Tween 20 for 30 min before being incubated in BLM or hTOPO IIIα (0.5 μg/ml) in TBS supplemented with 0.25% powdered milk, 0.3% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF for 60 min. Filters were washed four times for 10 min each in TBS containing 0.3% Tween 20, 0.25% powdered milk. The second wash contained 0.0001% glutaraldehyde. Conventional Western analysis was then performed to detect the presence of BLM or hTOPO IIIα using BFL-103 or D6, respectively, as primary antibody. Anti-rabbit IgG/horse radish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) was used as secondary antibody at a 1/10,000 dilution and detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid transformation of yeast strains was carried out by the modified protocol of Gietz et al. (31.Gietz D. Stjean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20 (1425): 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for uracil prototrophy and maintained under selection thereafter. Exponentially growing cultures in 2% glucose were diluted to an A 600 of 0.1, and 10 μl of each culture was streaked onto agar plates containing 2% glucose or 1% raffinose/0.5% galactose to activate expression from theGAL1 promoter. Plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 2–4 days to allow colony formation. For the preparation of whole cell extracts, 50-ml cultures of transformants were grown in 1% raffinose to an A 600 of 0.4, at which point 0.5% galactose was added. Cells were then cultured for a further 20 h and pelleted by centrifugation. After rinsing in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl), the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 volume of lysis buffer, and 1 volume of glass beads was added. Cells were lysed by vortexing for 10 min at 4 °C, after which, 10× SDS loading buffer was added, and the sample was boiled for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond-ECL filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then subjected to conventional Western analysis using mouse monoclonal anti-histidine antibody (Dianova) as the primary antibody. Anti-BLM antibodies were raised in rabbits against a chimeric protein consisting of MBP fused to residues 1–449 of BLM. The antiserum chosen for study, designated IHIC33, was affinity-purified using the MBP-BLM fusion protein, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using Western blotting, IHIC33 recognized purified recombinant BLM (12.Karow J.K.

No such protein was detected in cell extracts made from the fibroblast cell line, GM08505, which was derived from a patient with Bloom's syndrome and has been shown previously to lack expression of BLM (32.Neff N.F. Ellis N.A. Ye T.Z. Noonan J. Huang K. Sanz M. Proytcheva M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). However, extracts from PSNB2 cells (GM08505 cells transfected with pcDNA3/BLM, an expression construct carrying the BLMcDNA) did contain an immunoreactive species of the predicted molecular mass (Fig. 1 A), confirming that the IHIC33 antiserum is specific for the BLM protein. A monoclonal antibody specific for BLM, designated BFL-103, was raised in mice and detected recombinant BLM by Western blotting (Fig.1 B). Western blotting of different recombinant fragments of BLM revealed that the epitope recognized by BFL-103 resides in the nonconserved, N-terminal domain of BLM (Fig. 1 B). Additional validation of this antiserum is described below, in Fig. 4. Antibodies were also raised using purified recombinant hTOPO IIIα as antigen. Serum from immunized rabbits, designated D6, contained antibodies that recognized the purified recombinant hTOPO IIIα (30.Goulaouic H. Roulon T. Flamand O. Grondard L. Lavelle F. Riou J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2443-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). Two degradation products of the hTOPO IIIα protein present in the preparation were also recognized by this antiserum. In HeLa cell extracts, D6 antibodies detected two proteins of approximately 97 and 95 kDa (Fig.2 A). The same two proteins were also detectable in extracts from WI-38/VA-13 cells, a normal human fibroblast cell line, and from GM08505 cells (data not shown and see Fig. 4 D, below). Because hTOPO IIIα and hTOPO IIIβ share 36% homology and the D6 antiserum was generated using full-length recombinant hTOPO IIIα, it was possible that the reason for the presence of two immunoreactive bands on the Western blot was that the D6 antiserum can cross-react with hTOPO IIIβ"

Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sorting signal is comprised of an LPXTG motif followed by a C-terminal hydrophobic domain and a tail of positively charged amino acids (3.Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 4.Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 441-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During cell wall sorting, surface proteins are cleaved between the threonine and the glycine of the LPXTG motif (5.Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The liberated carboxyl group of threonine is amide linked to the amino group of the pentaglycine cross-bridge (6.Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), thereby tethering the C-terminal end of the polypeptide chain to the bacterial cell wall (7.Ton-That H. Faull K.F.

Surface protein cleavage at the LPXTG motif and peptidoglycan attachment occurs in staphylococcal protoplasts, i.e. bacteria in which the cell wall has been removed by digestion with muralytic enzyme (9.Ton-That H. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24316-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Vancomycin, an antibiotic that sequesters peptidoglycan precursors by binding to the d-Ala-d-Ala portion of lipid II (10.Walsh C.T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24316-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, surface proteins are likely linked to the pentaglycine cross-bridge of the lipid II peptidoglycan precursor. Lipid-linked intermediates are incorporated into the cell wall by the transpeptidation and transglycosylation reactions of bacterial cell wall synthesis (11.Matsuhashi M. Dietrich C.P.

Staphylococcus aureus strains carrying a knockout mutation in the sortase gene (srtA) fail to cleave sorting signals at the LPXTG motif, thereby abolishing cell wall anchoring and surface display of this class of proteins (12.Mazmanian S.K.

Sortase, a 206-amino acid polypeptide with an N-terminal signal sequence/stop transfer domain, is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane of staphylococci.1 Purified sortase as well as recombinant SrtAΔN, an enzyme in which the N-terminal signal sequence has been removed, cleave LPXTG motif bearing peptides (14.Ton-That H.

The strong nucleophile hydroxylamine interferes with the cell wall sorting reaction of staphylococci (14.Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Although sorting signals are cleaved at the LPXTG motif, surface proteins containing a C-terminal threonine hydroxamate are released into the extracellular medium. Presumably, hydroxylamine attacks an acyl-enzyme intermediate between surface protein and sortase (14.Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). When added to purified SrtAΔN, hydroxylamine increases the overall rate of cleavage at the LPXTG motif. Both in vitropeptide cleavage and hydroxylaminolysis depend on cysteine 184 of sortase (14.Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). We think it is likely that the cysteine sulfhydryl may function as the active site nucleophile to form a thioester bond between sortase and the carboxyl group of threonine at the C-terminal end of surface proteins. The principal components of the cell wall anchor structure of surface proteins 2G. Dhar, K. F. Faull, and O.

Sortase (srtA) homologs have been found in the sequenced genomes of Gram-positive bacteria, all of which feature absolute conservation of the single cysteine sulfhydryl.1 Previous work left unresolved whether sortase catalyzes a transpeptidation reaction in vitro using the peptidoglycan cross-bridges as amino group donors. Furthermore, the site of sortase-mediated cleavage in vitro has thus far not been identified. We find that purified sortase performs peptide bond hydrolysis and transpeptidation by cleaving between the threonine and the glycine of the LPXTG motif. When incubated with the amino group nucleophile NH2-Gly3, sortase catalyzes exclusively the transpeptidation reaction. Thus, sortase functions as a transpeptidase to anchor surface proteins to the pentaglycine cross-bridge of the bacterial cell wall. S. aureus strains RN4220 and SKM1 (srtA −) have been described previously (20.Kreiswirth B.N. Lofdahl S. Betley M.J. O'Reilly M. Schlievert P.M. Bergdoll M.S. Novick R.P. Nature. 1983; 305: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar).1 Plasmid pSM34 was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification from RN4220 chromosomal DNA using primers GSA1–12 (AAGGATCCTACCTTTTCCTCTAGCTGAAG) and SRT-C2A (CATTAATTACTGCTGATGATTAC) introducing a substitution of cysteine 184 with alanine. The DNA fragment was purified and, together with the primer GSA1–5 (AAGGATCCAAAAGGAGCGGTATACATTGC), used for polymerase chain reaction amplification with RN4220 template DNA. The amplified DNA fragment was purified, digested with BamHI, and ligated into pOS1 cut with BamHI. Plasmids pSM34 and pSrtA were electroporated into S. aureus SKM1 and transformants selected on chloramphenicol plates (10 μg/ml). Purification of recombinant sortase was performed as described previously (14.Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Staphylococcal cultures were grown overnight in chemically defined medium, diluted 1:20 into minimal medium and pulse-labeled at A 600 of 0.5. One ml of culture was labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]Promix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 min and the incorporation of radioactive amino acids into polypeptides was quenched by the addition of 50 μl of chase solution (100 mg/ml casamino acids, 10 mg/ml methionine and cysteine). Cultures were incubated and at defined intervals 250-μl aliquots were withdrawn and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were digested with lysostaphin (1 ml of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 μg/ml enzyme) for 1 h at 37 °C. Digests were precipitated by adding 75 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid, centrifuged, washed in acetone, and dried. The precipitate was solubilized by boiling in hot SDS and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Staphylococci were grown in minimal medium untilA 600 0.5. Four reaction tubes were prepared that contained either 100 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or 100 μl 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mhydroxylamine. To each tube, 1 ml of culture (109 cells) was added and bacteria were pulse-labeled with 100 μCi of Promix for 1 min. After the addition of chase solution (50 μl of 100 mg/ml casamino acids, 20 mg/ml methionine and cysteine), cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. All reactions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and suspended in 1 ml of 0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 7.0. Where indicated, peptidoglycan was digested with 100 μg of lysostaphin for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were again precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed in acetone, dried, and then boiled in SDS. Aliquots were subjected to immunoprecipitation with α-Seb3 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager. Samples were boiled in SDS (100 μl of 4% SDS, 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Twenty μl of sample was immunoprecipitated with α-Seb diluted 1:1000 into RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxylcholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5) and collected on protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed five times in RIPA buffer and boiled in 50 μl of sample buffer prior to separation on 15% SDS-PAGE. Dabcyl-QALPETGEE-Edans(d-QALPETGEE-e) was dissolved in 20% dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the kinetic reaction at a final concentration between 1 and 6 μm. Peptide cleavage was monitored as an increase of fluorescence using a FluoroMax-2 spectrometer (Instruments S.A., Inc.). The peptide was incubated in the presence or absence of 5 mm amino group nucleophile and 4.71 μmSrtAΔN in buffer R (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) in a volume of 520 μl. The increase in fluorescence intensity was recorded as a function of time using excitation at 350 nm and recording the emission maximum at 495 nm. Initial velocities were calculated as units of fluorescence per unit time using the following equation,V0=m*[S]/(I100−I0)Equation 1 where m is a slope during the linear phase of the cleavage, [S] is substrate concentration, andI 0 and I 100 are the fluorescence intensities of substrate solution before and after complete cleavage (21.Fillipova I.Y.

Slope (m) was measured in three independent experiments. Kinetic constants K m,V max, and k cat were calculated from the curve fit for the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Lineweaver-Burk plot (22.Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H.

A reaction mixture consisting of 10 μm fluorescent peptides, 15 μm recombinant enzymes in 520 μl of Buffer R was incubated either in the presence or absence of 5 mmNH2-Gly3 at 37 °C for 16 h. The reaction was quenched by filtration using Centricon-10 filters (Millipore). The filtrate was subjected to RP-HPLC purification on C-18 column (2 × 250-mm, C18 Hypersil, Keystone Scientific). Separation was carried out at 40 °C with a gradient from 1 to 41% CH3CN (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in 41 min and from 41 to 100% for 10 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Elution of peptides was monitored at 215 nm and fractions were collected every minute, dried under vacuum, and stored at 4 °C for ESI-MS analysis as described previously (7.Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22285-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23.Navarre W.W. Ton-That H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15847-15856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). If cysteine 184 functions as a nucleophile for the cell wall anchoring reaction, a sortase enzyme lacking this sulfhydryl should be unable to cleave surface proteins at the LPXTG motif. This assumption was tested by replacing cysteine 184 of sortase with alanine (SrtAC184A). Plasmids encoding either wild-type (pSrtA) or mutant sortase (pSM34) were transformed into S. aureus SKM1 (srtA −). Staphylococci were examined for the ability to process cell wall sorting signals. Wild-type staphylococci synthesize surface protein precursor bearing an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal sorting signal (P1 precursor). Following export across the cytoplasmic membrane and signal peptide cleavage, sortase cleaves the P2 precursor between the threonine and the glycine of the LPXTG motif to generate mature, cell wall anchored surface protein (Fig. 1 A). As expected, the sortase mutant strain SKM1 failed to cleave polypeptides at the LPXTG motif and accumulated P2 precursor species (Fig. 1 B). Transformation of SKM1 cells with plasmids that allowed expression of wild-type SrtA, but not SrtAC184A, restored precursor processing at the LPXTG motif. Thus, the sulfhydryl of cysteine 184 is absolutely necessary for the processing of sorting signals and the cell wall anchoring of surface proteins. We asked whether cysteine 184 of sortase is required for the formation of a sortase acyl-enzyme intermediate and examined the hydroxylaminolysis of surface proteins in vivo. When pulse-labeled staphylococcal cultures are precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and boiled in SDS, only proteins secreted into the extracellular medium are soluble in hot SDS (3.Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In contrast, staphylococcal surface proteins, membrane or cytoplasmic proteins require digestion of the cell wall with lysostaphin for solubility in hot SDS (3.Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Staphylococcal cultures were pulse-labeled in the presence or absence of hydroxylamine. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated samples were divided in two aliquots. One sample was boiled in SDS, whereas the other was subjected to peptidoglycan digestion prior to boiling in SDS. The addition of hydroxylamine caused wild-type staphylococci to release pulse-labeled surface protein into the extracellular medium (Fig.1 C). The sortase mutant strain SKM1 was unable to catalyze hydroxylaminolysis and all pulse-labeled surface protein precursors required digestion of the staphylococcal cell wall for solubility in hot SDS. Transformation of strain SKM1 with plasmids that expressed wild-type SrtA, but not SrtAC184A, restored hydroxylaminolysis of surface proteins (Fig. 1, C andD). Similar to srtA − cells, the cysteine mutant accumulated uncleaved P2 precursor species that required lysostaphin digestion of the peptidoglycan for solubility in hot SDS. Thus, the sulfhydryl of cysteine 184 is absolutely required for the formation of sortase acyl-enzyme intermediates. Purified SrtAΔN was used to study in vitro hydrolysis and transpeptidation reactions of sortase. To determine the site ofin vitro substrate cleavage,d-QALPETGEE-e peptides were incubated with SrtAΔN. Enzymatic reactions were quenched by filtration, separating the enzyme from peptide substrate and products. Sample filtrate was analyzed by RP-HPLC. When incubated without SrtAΔN, d-QALPETGEE-e eluted as a single absorption peak at 50 min (36% CH3CN) (Fig.2 A). However, after incubation of d-QALPETGEE-e with sortase, two new peaks were identified that eluted at 29 (15% CH3CN) and 53 (39% CH3CN) min (Fig. 2 B). Collected RP-HPLC fractions were analyzed by ESI-MS. Measurements were consistent with the cleavage of d-QALPETGEE-e (observed mass 1471.8, calculated mass 1471.6) between the threonine and the glycine of the LPXTG motif, generating the cleavage productsd-QALPET (observed mass 908.4, calculated mass 909.0) and GEE-e (observed mass 581.1, calculated mass 580.6) (data not shown). To further characterize the reaction products, the 581.1-Da peptide was subjected to Edman degradation, yielding the peptide sequence GEE. The 908.4-Da peptide was analyzed in an MS/MS experiment (Fig. 2 C). Collisionally induced dissociation of the parent ion at m/z 910.7 generated fragment ions that confirmed the compound structure d-QALPET (TableI). Together these results demonstrate that sortase hydrolyses the peptide bond between the threonine and the glycine of the LPXTG motif.Table ISummary of daughter ions produced during MS/MS of the 909 Da compoundObservedCharge stateCalculatedaCalculations are based on average masses according to the MacBioSpec™ program.Δobs-calcbThe difference between the observed and calculated masses of daughter ions.Proposed structureIon typecNomenclature refers to N- and C-terminal cleavage fragments according to Roepfstorff and Fohlman (15) and Biemann (13).m/zm/z102.2+1103.1−0.9Tz1199.7+1199.2+0.5QA—dFragments thought to arise by two cleavages are calculated as the sum of the residue masses.227.6+1226.2+1.4PE—dFragments thought to arise by two cleavages are calculated as the sum of the residue masses.252.5+1252.3+0.2Dabcylb0269.6+1267.3+2.3Dabcylc0328.7+1327.3+1.4PET—dFragments thought to arise by two cleavages are calculated as the sum of the residue masses.346.7+1346.4+0.3PETy3380.6+1380.4+0.2Dabcyl-Qb1410.9+1409.5+1.4QALP—dFragments thought to arise by two cleavages are calculated as the sum of the residue masses.451.7+1451.5+0.2Dabcyl-QAb2459.2+1459.5−0.3LPETy4530.3+1530.6−0.3ALPETy5564.8+1564.7+0.1Dabcyl-QALb3661.4+1661.8−0.4Dabcyl-QALPb4890.9+1892.0−1.1Dabcyl-QALPETb6910.7+1910.0+0.7Dabcyl-QALPETParent iona Calculations are based on average masses according to the MacBioSpec™ program.b The difference between the observed and calculated masses of daughter ions.c Nomenclature refers to N- and C-terminal cleavage fragments according to Roepfstorff and Fohlman (15.Roepstorff P.

Open table in a new tab We sought to determine whether sortase catalyzes a transpeptidation reaction in the presence of the physiological nucleophile, i.e. the amino group of glycine. The presumed peptidoglycan substrate of the sorting reaction, lipid II (undecaprenyl-pyrophosphate-MurNac(-l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(NH2-Gly5)-d-Ala- d-(Ala)-β1–4-GlcNac)), is difficult to purify in sufficient quantities (11.Matsuhashi M. Dietrich C.P. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We therefore replaced lipid II with NH2-Gly3 as a peptidoglycan substrate. The polypeptide substrated-QALPETGEE-e and NH2-Gly3 were incubated with SrtAΔN, reaction products were filtered and analyzed by RP-HPLC. In addition to the residual substrate peaks at 50 min (d-QALPETGEE-e) and 4 min (NH2-Gly3) (data not shown), two new peaks of absorption at 215 nm were identified (Fig.3, A and B). The compound that eluted at 29 min was analyzed by ESI-MS and generated an average mass of 581.1 Da, consistent with the predicted mass of the peptide GEE-e. This result indicated that sortase had cleaved d-QALPETGEE-e at the peptide bond between threonine and glycine. The compound that eluted at 51 min was also analyzed by ESI-MS, producing ion signals at m/z 540.8 and 1080.8 with an average compound mass of 1079.7. These measurements are consistent with the calculated mass of the transpeptidation productd-QALPET-Gly3 (1080.2 Da). To determine the structure of this compound, the singly charged parent ion atm/z 1080.8 was analyzed in an MS/MS experiment (Fig.3 C). Collisionally induced dissociation produced ions confirmed the peptide sequence d-QALPET-Gly3(Table II). The chromatograms of Fig.2 B and Fig. 3 A were enlarged to more closely examine the product peaks (Fig. 3 B). When sortase was incubated with d-QALPETGEE-e and NH2-Gly3, no hydrolysis product (d-QALPET) could be detected. Thus, sortase catalyzed exclusively the transpeptidation reaction and accumulated only the products d-QALPET-Gly3 and GEE-e.Table IISummary of daughter ions produced during MS/MS of the 1080 Da compoundObservedCharge stateCalculatedaCalculations are based on average masses according to the MacBioSpec™ program.Δobs-calcbThe difference between the observed and calculated masses of daughter ions.Proposed structureIon typecNomenclature refers to N- and C-terminal cleavage fragments according to Roepfstorff and Fohlman (15) and Biemann (13).m/zm/z227.6+1226.2+1.4PE—dFragments thought to arise by two cleavages are calculated as the sum of the residue masses.252.5+1252.3+0.2Dabcylb0291.8+1291.3+0.5TGGGy4328.7+1327.3+1.4PET—dFragments thought to arise by two cleavages are calculated as the sum of the residue masses.380.6+1380.4+0.2Dabcyl-Qb1442.1+1441.4+0.7PETGG—dFragments thought to arise by two cleavages are calculated as the sum of the residue masses.451.7+1451.5+0.2Dabcyl-QAb2499.4+1500.5−1.1PETGGGy6-OH517.4+1517.5−0.1PETGGGy6564.2+1564.7−0.5Dabcyl-QALb3630.5+1630.7−0.2LPETGGGy7661.4+1661.8−0.4Dabcyl-QALPb4683.6+1684.7−1.1ALPETGGGz8701.3+1701.8−0.5ALPETGGGy8790.1+1790.9−0.8Dabcyl-QALPEb5891.2+1892.0−0.8Dabcyl-QALPETb6930.5+1932.0−1.5Dabcyl-QALPETGb7-OH947.3+1949.0−1.7Dabcyl-QALPETGb71006.1+11006.10Dabcyl-QALPETGGb81061.9+11063.1−1.2Dabcyl-QALPETGGGb91080.8+11081.2−0.4Dabcyl-QALPETGGGparent iona Calculations are based on average masses according to the MacBioSpec™ program.b The difference between the observed and calculated masses of daughter ions.c Nomenclature refers to N- and C-terminal cleavage fragments according to Roepfstorff and Fohlman (15.Roepstorff P.

Open table in a new tab Fluorescence of the Edans fluorophore (e) within the peptide d-QALPETGEE-eis quenched by the close proximity of Dabcyl (d). When the peptide is cleaved by sortase, and the fluorophore is separated from Dabcyl, an increase in fluorescence is observed. During transpeptidation conditions, i.e. when SrtAΔNwas incubated with d-QALPETGEE-e and NH2-Gly3, the rate of peptide cleavage was increased as compared with the rate of hydrolysis at the LPXTG motif (i.e. incubation of SrtAΔN with d-QALPETGEE-e but without NH2-Gly3) (Fig.4, a and b). As a control, incubation of d-QALPETGEE-e with a cysteine mutant enzyme, SrtAΔN, C184A, did not result in substrate cleavage between the threonine and the glycine of the LPXTG motif (Fig. 4, d). Furthermore, the addition of the sufhydryl reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate inhibited sortase and abolished all peptide cleavage (Fig. 4 c). Together these results indicate that sortase catalyzes the transpeptidation reaction at a rate that is at least 2-fold faster than the rate of peptide bond hydrolysis (Table III). As expected, the sulfhydryl of cysteine 184 is absolutely necessary for in vitro substrate cleavage to occur. A K m of 16.48 μm and a K cat of 2.27 × 10−5 (1/s) was calculated for the sortase-catalyzed transpeptidation reaction (Table III). The affinity of sortase ford-QALPETGEE-e substrate was slightly increased in the presence of NH2-Gly3 as was the overall efficiency of the cleavage reaction. Immediately after mixing reaction components, SrtAΔN did not cleave substrate for several minutes. We do not know the reason for this delay in cleavage activity.Table IIIKinetic analysis of SrtAΔNNucleophileK mV maxK catK m/K catμmμm/sl/sl/μm · sH2O10.885.08 × 10−51.06 × 10−59.77 × 10−7NH2-Gly316.481.08 × 10−42.27 × 10−51.38 × 10−6Kinetic constants K m, V max, andk cat were calculated from the curve fit for the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Lineweaver-Burk plot.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic constants K m, V max, andk cat were calculated from the curve fit for the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Lineweaver-Burk plot. Reaction conditions are described in the legend to Fig. 4. We asked whether the rate of substrate cleavage depended on the nature of the added nucleophile. Addition of the strong nucleophile hydroxylamine caused a relatively small increase in the rate ofd-QALPETGEE-e cleavage (TableIV). However, the presence of the weaker nucleophiles NH2-Gly, NH2-Gly2, or NH2-Gly3 caused a greater increase in the rate of substrate cleavage, suggesting that sortase recognizes the physiological nucleophile of the transpeptidation reaction,i.e. the amino group of the pentaglycine cross-bridge (TableIV). The fastest rate of substrate cleavage was observed when sortase was incubated in the presence of NH2-Gly3.Table IVThe effect of different nucleophiles on the rate of LPXTG peptide cleavage by sortase (SrtAΔN)Nucleophilem (s−1)aSlope of the kinetic curves as shown in Fig. 4.

Open table in a new tab Surface protein anchoring in S. aureus is catalyzed via a transpeptidation reaction, employing polypeptide and peptidoglycan substrates (2.Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polypeptide substrate, i.e. surface protein precursor with C-terminal sorting signal bearing an LPXTG motif, is cleaved by sortase between the threonine and the glycine of the LPXTG motif (5.Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). As pulse-labeled surface proteins cannot be found in the extracellular medium, sortase does not hydrolyze polypeptides at the LPXTG motif in vivo(3.Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Cleaved polypeptides are thought to be captured as acyl-enzyme intermediates, presumably involving cysteine 184 and the formation of a thioester bond (14.Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The intermediate is resolved by the nucleophilic attack of the cross-bridge amino group, resulting in the formation of an amide bond between the threonine of the LPXTG motif and the pentaglycine cross-bridge (6.Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We think it is likely that lipid II serves as a peptidoglycan substrate for the cell wall sorting reaction (9.Ton-That H. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24316-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, as lipid II biosynthesis is essential for staphylococcal growth, this prediction cannot be tested with isogenic pairs of wild-type and mutant strains that fail to synthesize lipid II. Our work is therefore focused on the biochemical characterization of the sorting reaction and we demonstrate here that purified sortase catalyzes a transpeptidation reaction at the LPXTG motif. The rate of sortase mediated cleavage at the LPXTG motif is increased in the presence NH2-Gly, NH2-Gly2, or NH2-Gly3, suggesting that the enzyme interacts with the cell wall cross-bridge. Furthermore, these results suggest that the rate-limiting step of surface protein anchoring is the nucleophilic attack of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. This hypothesis may also explain the relative resistance of sortase to various slow-reacting sulfhydryl reagents: the active site sulfhydryl of sortase is generally engaged with an acyl intermediate of cleaved surface protein (9.Ton-That H. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24316-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). During cell wall synthesis, bacterial penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) cleave glycan-linked cell wall pentapeptides (l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala) at the amide bond between d-Ala-d-Ala (24.Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 25.Ghuysen J.-M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The carboxyl group of d-Ala is ester linked to the enzyme active site, i.e. the hydroxyl group of serine (26.Yocum R.R. Waxman D.J. Rasmussen J.R. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2730-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Nucleophilic attack of the amino group of glycine resolves the enzyme intermediate, forming an amide bond between d-Ala and the pentaglycine cross-bridge of neighboring peptidoglycan strands (27.Rasmussen J.R. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Kozarich and Strominger (28.Kozarich J.W. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1272-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have purified and studied the 46-kDa PBP from S. aureus H, using diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala and NH2-Gly as substrates. In the absence of amino group nucleophiles, the S. aureus enzyme hydrolyzed the amide bond between d-Ala-d-Ala (28.Kozarich J.W. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1272-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, at NH2-Gly concentrations of 1 mm or higher this PBP performed exclusively the transpeptidation reaction of bacterial cell wall synthesis. The addition of glycine increased the overall performance of the S. aureus enzyme as measured by the cleavage of diacetyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala (28.Kozarich J.W. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1272-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydroxylamine, although a stronger nucleophile than glycine (29.Kozarich J.W. Tokuzo N. Willoughby E. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7525-7529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), caused a much smaller increase in enzyme performance than glycine, while the addition of d-Ala inhibited the transpeptidase activity (28.Kozarich J.W. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1272-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A V max of 0.4 μm/min/mg enzyme and substrate K m 100 mm were observed for the S. aureus PBP as compared with the V max of 0.06 μm/min/mg enzyme and K m 16.48 μm described here for sortase. The results of Kozarich and Strominger (28.Kozarich J.W. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1272-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the S. aureus PBP specifically binds the amino group nucleophile glycine and that this recognition event is a rate-limiting step in the overall transpeptidation reaction. Thus, the staphylococcal PBP displays properties that are similar to those observed for sortase."

The encoded protein, designated as Asc-1 (asc-type amino acid transporter 1), was found to be structurally related to recently identified mammalian amino acid transporters for the transport systems L, y+L, xC−, and b0,+, which are linked, via a disulfide bond, to the type II membrane glycoproteins, 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc), or rBAT (related to b0,+ amino acid transporter). Asc-1 required 4F2hc for its functional expression. In Western blot analysis in the nonreducing condition, a 118-kDa band, which seems to correspond to the heterodimeric complex of Asc-1 and 4F2hc, was detected in the mouse brain. The band shifted to 33 kDa in the reducing condition, confirming that Asc-1 and 4F2hc are linked via a disulfide bond. Asc-1-mediated transport was not dependent on the presence of Na+ or Cl−. Although Asc-1 showed a high sequence homology (66% identity at the amino acid level) to the Na+-independent broad scope neutral amino acid transporter LAT2 (Segawa, H., Fukasawa, Y., Miyamoto, K., Takeda, E., Endou, H., and Kanai, Y.

Asc-1 preferred small neutral amino acids such as Gly,l-Ala, l-Ser, l-Thr, andl-Cys, and α-aminoisobutyric acid as substrates. Asc-1 also transported d-isomers of the small neutral amino acids, in particular d-Ser, a putative endogenous modulator of N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors, with high affinity. Asc-1 operated preferentially, although not exclusively, in an exchange mode. Asc-1 mRNA was detected in the brain, lung, small intestine, and placenta.

Recently, a protein structurally related to the 4F2hc-associated transporters has been identified that couples with the cystinuria-related type II membrane glycoprotein rBAT (related to b0,+ amino acid transporter) to form a system b0,+ amino acid transporter, thereby establishing a family of amino acid transporters associated with type II membrane glycoproteins (LAT family) (17.Chairoungdua A.

Based on this assumption, we attempted to search for proteins structurally related to the 4F2hc-associated transporters and identified a novel transporter that exhibits functional properties apparently consistent with those of a transporter subserving system asc, a Na+-independent transport system for small neutral amino acids (1.Christensen H.N.

When expressed with 4F2hc inXenopus oocytes, Asc-1 mediates the transport of neutral amino acids, in particular, small amino acids without bulky or branched side chains, in a Na+-independent manner, reminiscent of the Na+-independent small neutral amino acid transport system asc (1.Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 19.Barker G.A. Ellory J.C. Exp. Physiopl. 1990; 75: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, we named this transporter Asc-1 (asc-type amino acid transporter 1). Asc-1 is a member of the family of amino acid transporters associated with type II membrane glycoproteins (LAT family) (17.Chairoungdua A. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Miyamoto K. Haga H. Fukui Y. Mizoguchi K. Ito H. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).It has been shown that 4F2hc and its associated transporters are linked via a disulfide bond to form heterodimeric complexes (4.Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. Nature. 1998; 395: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 5.Mannion B.A. Kolesnikova T.V. Lin S.-H. Thompson N.L.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The results from the Western blot analyses using antibodies raised against Asc-1 and 4F2hc are consistent with the idea that Asc-1 and 4F2hc are linked to each other via a disulfide band (Fig. 2). The 118-kDa band detected in the nonreducing condition seems to correspond to the heterodimeric complex of Asc-1 and 4F2hc. In the transporters associated with 4F2hc, it is proposed that a conserved cysteine residue in the extracellular loop between putative transmembrane domains 3 and 4 is involved in the disulfide bond formation between 4F2hc and the transporters (31.Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The corresponding cysteine residue is also conserved in Asc-1 (Cys160). In addition, it should be noted that although a 33-kDa band corresponding to the Asc-1 monomeric protein is detected in the nonreducing condition, no such band corresponding to the 4F2hc monomer is present, suggesting that the 33-kDa band is not due to the unexpected reduction of the protein but due to the presence of the Asc-1 protein not associated with 4F2hc (Fig. 2).Among the members of LAT family, Asc-1 exhibits the highest structural similarity to LAT2. LAT2 is a Na+-independent neutral amino acid transporter with a broad substrate selectivity that accepts all neutral l-α-amino acids, including small amino acids without bulky side chains and large amino acids with branched or aromatic side chains (13.Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19745-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), whereas Asc-1 preferentially transports only small amino acids. LAT1, the other neutral amino acid-specific transporter of the LAT family, preferentially transports only large neutral amino acids (3.Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23629-23632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The system l-selective inhibitor, BCH, while strongly inhibiting amino acid transport mediated by LAT1 and LAT2 (3.Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23629-23632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 13.Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19745-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), is not an effective inhibitor of Asc-1. There seems to be an interesting transition in the spacial configuration of the substrate-binding sites among Asc-1, LAT2 and LAT1.Asc-1 exhibits distinctive properties not only in its selectivity for small neutral l-amino acids but also in its acceptance ofd-amino acids and amino acid-related compounds. Asc-1 transports d-isomers of serine and alanine (Fig. 5 and Table I). d-Threonine and d-cysteine are also shown to be transport substrates because they induce the efflux of preloaded radiolabeled amino acids via an exchange mechanism as discussed below (Fig. 8 b). LAT2-mediated transport is also inhibited, although weakly, by d-isomers of some amino acids such as serine, cysteine, and asparagine, even though they are not transported by LAT2 (13.Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19745-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). LAT1 accepts d-leucine,d-phenylalanine, and d-methionine (3.Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23629-23632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), which are, in fact, low affinity substrates for the transporter. 2H. Segawa, H. Endou, and Y. Kanai, unpublished observation. Although the absence of marked stereoselectivity seems to be a common characteristic of the LAT family, that of Asc-1 seems to be quite distinctive in that it mediates high affinity transport of d-amino acids.It is notable that the affinity of Asc-1 for d-serine is particularly high (Table I). It is shown that d-serine is present in the mammalian brain and is proposed to be an endogenous modulator of N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (33.Hashimoto A. Oka T. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 52: 325-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Although the kinetics of d-serine in the brain is not fully understood, it is proposed that the local concentration of d-serine around glutamatergic synapses is under the regulation of the transporters of d-serine (33.Hashimoto A. Oka T. Prog. Neurobiol. 1997; 52: 325-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). It was indicated that ASCT2, a Na+-dependent transporter of the neutral amino acid transport system ASC, acceptsd-isomers of serine, threonine, and cysteine (20.Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Their affinity is, however, proposed to be relatively low. Therefore, it would be of interest to understand the role of Asc-1, which is strongly expressed in the brain (Fig. 12), in the mobilization ofd-serine around the glutamatergic synapses and in the modulation of glutamatergic transmission.AIB is a high affinity substrate of Asc-1, whereas itsN-methyl-derivative MeAIB is not accepted by Asc-1 (Fig. 6and Table I). Alanine-methylester appears to be a substrate of Asc-1, because it induces the efflux of preloaded [14C]l-alanine as discussed below (Fig.8 c). Therefore, it is proposed that the presence of α-amino groups is essential in the substrates of Asc-1, whereas that of α-carboxyl groups is less important because alanine-methylester, which dose not contain the latter, is accepted by Asc-1. In agreement with this, β-alanine is a transport substrate, although the affinity of Asc-1 for it is lower than that for α-amino acid substrates.We previously reported that LAT1 mediates amino acid exchange, whereas LAT2 mediates the facilitated diffusion of substrate amino acids (3.Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23629-23632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar,13.Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19745-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs. 7 and 10, extracellularly applied substrates markedly stimulate the efflux of preloaded [14C]l-alanine, whereas significant efflux is still detected in their absence. This indicates that Asc-1 mediates two modes of transport, “exchange transport” and “facilitated diffusion,” with the exchange mode appearing to be the predominant mode. Such dual operation is often observed for transporters. For example, the organic anion transporter OAT1 mediates both the exchange and facilitated modes; glutamate transporters mediate K+-dependent “uptake transport” as well as K+-independent exchange transport (34.Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18526-18529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 35.Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Based on the exchange property, it is considered possible to determine whether the compounds that inhibit Asc-1-mediated transport are also its substrates or just inhibitors, even if radiolabeled compounds are not available (46.Apiwattanakul N. Sekine T. Chairoungdua A. Kanai Y. Nakajima N. Sophasan S. Endou H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 847-854PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8 a, the profile of amino acid-induced efflux of preloaded [14C]l-alanine is basically identical to that of the uptake of radiolabeled amino acids, indicating that the efflux of radioactivity reflects the transport of extracellularly applied amino acids via the Asc-1-mediated exchange. d-Threonine,d-cysteine, and alanine-methylester are suggested to be transported by Asc-1, because they induce the efflux of preloaded [14C]l-alanine (Fig. 8, b andc).By microinjecting radiolabeled compounds into oocytes expressing Asc-1, we assessed the intracellular substrate selectivity of Asc-1. As Fig. 9indicates, intracellular substrate selectivity is basically identical to that of the extracellular substrate-binding site. The efflux of low affinity substrates, however, appears to be less than that expected, probably reflecting the competition between intracellularly loaded14C-labeled compounds and high affinity substrates present endogenously in Xenopus oocytes.System asc was initially characterized in horse erythrocytes and later demonstrated to be also present in other cell systems such as pigeon, Pacific hagfish and trout erythrocytes, exocrine pancreatic cells, and transformed kidney cells (37.Fincham D.A. Mason D.K. Young J.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38.Vadgama J.V. Christensen H.N. J. Biol.

Vadgama J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15042-15047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The originally described system asc was a high affinity, stereospecific, and Na+-independent transport system for small neutral amino acids that operates preferentially but not exclusively in the exchange mode (37.Fincham D.A. Mason D.K. Young J.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). System C, a low affinity transport system with a similar substrate selectivity to that of system asc, was described in pigeon erythrocytes (43.Young J.D. Ellory J.C. Tucker E.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 44.Young J.D. Ellory J.C. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Heterogeneity in substrate selectivity, transport mode, and pH dependence was described for system asc (37.Fincham D.A. Mason D.K. Young J.D. Biochem.

Biol. 1994; 140: 189-196PubMed Google Scholar). Asc-1 has high affinity for small neutral amino acids, is not pH-dependent, and operates preferentially in the exchange mode, which resembles the properties of system asc originally described in horse erythrocytes (37.Fincham D.A. Mason D.K. Young J.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), except that Asc-1 is less stereospecific. Therefore, we propose that Asc-1 is the first isolated isoform of system asc transporters. As described under “Results,” the mRNA for Asc-1 could not be detected in anemic spleen, indicating that Asc-1 is not an erythrocyte system asc transporter. It is suggested that transporters structurally related to Asc-1 and associated with 4F2hc are also present in erythrocytes, which exhibit the functional properties of classical erythrocyte system asc transporters.We have identified a novel Na+-independent neutral amino acid transporter, Asc-1, that associates with 4F2hc and exhibits the functional properties that seem to be consistent with those of a transporter of system asc. Asc-1 belongs to the LAT family and is structurally related, in particular, to LAT2, a system L transporter. Therefore, it is expected that structure-function analyses based on a comparison between Asc-1 and LAT2 provide useful information to understand the structural features that are responsible for the apparently different substrate selectivities of the members of the LAT family. Amino acid transport across the plasma membrane is mediated by both Na+-dependent and Na+-independent transporters (1.Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Recent molecular cloning approaches have led to the identification of amino acid transporters corresponding to amino acid transport systems described in the past in culture cells or membrane vesicle preparations (2.Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Although the cDNAs for various Na+-dependent amino acid transporters have been successfully isolated, the molecular characteristics of Na+-independent amino acid transporters have not yet been determined, except for those of cationic amino acid transport systems (2.Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Recently, by means of expression cloning, we isolated a cDNA encoding the Na+-independent transporter LAT1, subserving the amino acid transport system L, which preferentially transports large neutral amino acids with branched or aromatic side chains (3.Kanai Y.

(Vogelstein, B., and Kinzler, K., eds) Chapter 9, McGraw-Hill Book Co., New YorkGoogle Scholar); to date, seven complementation groups (A to G) in xeroderma pigmentosum and two (A and B) in Cockayne's syndrome have been identified, and most of the corresponding NER genes have been cloned (4.Boulikas T.

The xeroderma pigmentosum group C protein complex XPC-HR23B is a tightly associated complex of the products of the XPC andHR23B genes and was initially purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts as a protein factor that complemented the DNA repair defects of XP-C whole cell extracts in a cell-free NER reaction (14.Masutani C.

Although no enzymatic activity was observed in the purified complex, it has been reported that this complex is required for DNA repair prior to the excision step (15.Shivji M.K.K. Eker A.P.M.

Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F.

Moreover, using recombinant human XPC and HR23B, the high affinity of XPC-HR23B for both double-stranded and UV-irradiated DNA has also been demonstrated (17.Reardon J.T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19451-19456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 2C. Masutani, K. Sugasawa, and F. Hanaoka, unpublished observations. Several lines of evidence have been accumulated that indicate that this complex plays a role in NER before and after damage recognition. We recently demonstrated, using a novel DNA damage recognition-competition assay, that XPC-HR23B is the earliest acting of the damage detectors that initiate NER (18.Sugasawa K. Ng J.M.Y. Masutani C. Iwai S. van der Spek P.J. Eker A.P.M. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). XPC, together with TFIIH, is necessary for the initial opening reaction immediately around the lesion (19.Evans E. Moggs J.G. Hwang J.R. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6559-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The XPC-HR23B complex was characterized as a molecular matchmaker that participates in the assembly of the NER proteins on damaged DNA but is not present in the ultimate dual incision complex (20.Wakasugi M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6669-6674Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These data prompted us to hypothesize that XPC-HR23B plays important roles in the assembly of NER proteins on the damaged DNA and in initiation of NER. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that follow damage detection by XPC remain unclear. Here we report that XPC-HR23B interacts directly with TFIIH in vitro and that XPC-HR23B is absolutely required for association of TFIIH with damaged DNA in cell extracts. We conclude that XPC-HR23B is necessary for recruitment of TFIIH to damaged DNA. Human 293, XP7CASV (group A), and XP4PASV (group C) cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells were grown in suspension at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (21.Manley J.L.

Eight subunits of TFIIH (XPB, XPD, p62, p44, p34, MO15, cyclin H, and MAT1) were expressed inE. coli as GST fusion proteins. The coding regions of these subunits were cloned using PCR technique. PCR primers designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site at the first methionine codon of XPB, XPD, p62, p44, p34, MO15, and cyclin H or anNcoI site at the first methionine codon of MAT1 were used in conjunction with antisense primers containing an appropriate restriction site: a BamHI restriction site for XPB, p62, p44, MO15, cyclin H, and MAT1, a HindIII restriction site for XPD, and an EcoRI restriction site for p34. PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, subcloned into the multicloning site of the E. coli expression vector pGEX-2TL(+) (24.Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 368: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) from HeLa cells was also carried out as described previously. Anti-cyclin H antibody was conjugated to Immunopure Immobilized protein G beads (Pierce) in 100 μl of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 200 μm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.2 m KCl, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. After washing three times with buffer C, the antibody-bound Sepharose beads (5 μl) were incubated with 80 μg of whole cell extracts prepared from 293 human fibroblasts in 80 μl of buffer C at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rotation. After washing three times with buffer C, the bound proteins were extracted by boiling in SDS sample buffer (1× concentration is 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1.5% SDS, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting with antibodies raised against XPC, XPB, p62, XPA, or RPA32. rHR23B-His6 (2.2 mg) was dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) and 0.3m NaCl and then incubated with activated CH-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C overnight in the same buffer. Unreacted groups were quenched by washing with excess buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.5 mNaCl. The rHR23B-His6-Sepharose beads (10 μl) were preincubated with or without rXPC (90 ng) in buffer C for 30 min on ice, mixed with purified TFIIH (200 ng), and further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rotation. After washing three times with buffer C, bound proteins were extracted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p62 antibody. Alternatively, GST-tagged HR23B, which had been incubated with or without rXPC for 30 min on ice, was incubated with purified TFIIH (200 ng), and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rotation. The mixture was adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then washed three times with buffer C. The bound proteins were extracted, separated, and analyzed as described above. GST-tagged TFIIH subunits (100 ng) were adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads in 100 μl of buffer D (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm dithiothrietol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.6 μg/ml antipain, 0.6 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.3 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.24 μg/ml pepstatin, 150 μm EGTA) at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. After washing three times with buffer C, the beads were incubated in the same buffer at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation in the presence of purified XPC-HR23B complex (50 ng), rXPC (60 ng), rHR23B (60 ng), rRPA (200 ng), or rPCNA (200 ng). After washing three times with buffer C, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated by 8% (for detection of XPC and HR23B) or 12% (for detection of RPA and PCNA) SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-XPC, HR23B, RPA32, or PCNA antibodies. In advance, we confirmed that full-length GST-tagged TFIIH subunits were expressed in E. coli by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody (data not shown). Antibodies raised against XPC and HR23B were obtained as described previously (23.Sugasawa K. Masutani C. Uchida A. Maekawa T. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4852-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Antibodies raised against XPB, p62, cyclin H, RPA32, PCNA, and GST were prepared by Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. Anti-XPA polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Kiyoji Tanaka. To prepare three kinds of cellulose solution for the precipitation experiments, ssDNA-cellulose and dsDNA-cellulose (both from Sigma-Aldrich) or cellulose CF11 (Whatman) was mixed with equal volumes of Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and suspended (50% v/v) in buffer C. The dsDNA cellulose-Sepharose solution contained 7 μg of DNA in 10 μl. Whole cell extracts (125 μg) from 293 or xeroderma pigmentosum cells were incubated with 10 μl of the cellulose-Sepharose suspensions in buffer C at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rotation. After washing three times with buffer C, the bound proteins were extracted, separated by 10–14% gradient SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-XPC, p62, XPA, or RPA32 antibodies. Buffer C without ATP or with 2 mm AMP-PNP was used in separate experiments designed to test the ATP dependence of binding. PCR reactions were performed with T3 and biotin-labeled T7 primers, using a partial (nucleotides 8330–9079) human Rev3 cDNA (28.Gibbs P.E. McGregor W.G. Maher V.M. Nisson P. Lawrence C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6876-6880Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBS as template. PCR reactions (35 cycles) were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl containing 10 ng of the template DNA, 10 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2 mmMgSO4, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μm dNTPs, 20 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). Each cycle consisted of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. After removal of excess primer by ethanol precipitation, the PCR products were adsorbed to Streptavidin-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) in TE (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl at room temperature for 1 h with gentle agitation. Damaged DNA substrate was prepared by treating PCR products in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA) (pH 7.5) containing 20% ethanol (0.2 μg/ml) with 0.15 mm N-AAAF at 37 °C for varying times followed by di-ethyl-ether extraction, chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Damaged or undamaged DNA substrate (2 μg) dissolved in TE (pH 8.0) was incubated with 20 μl of a 2-fold suspension of Streptavidin-agarose in TE (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl at room temperature for 1 h with gentle agitation. After washing with the same buffer, whole cell extracts (125 μg) was incubated with DNA bound-agarose in 100 μl of buffer C at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with buffer C, the bound proteins were extracted, separated by 10–14% gradient SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-XPC, p62, XPA, or RPA32 antibodies. The ATP dependence was examined as described above. SDS-PAGE were performed as described previously (29.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins separated on SDS gels were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore) at 8 V/cm 15 h in ice-cold transfer buffer (50 mm Tris, 38.4 mm glycine, 0.01% SDS, and 15% methanol). The membranes were successively incubated in blocking buffer (1% Blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 0.1 m maleic acid (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl), antibody in blocking buffer, and finally anti-rabbit or anti-mouse F(ab′)2 antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection was carried out with SuperSignal Substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured as described previously (30.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Of the mammalian NER factors identified to date, only TFIIH has been suggested to interact with XPC (31.Drapkin R. Reardon J.T. Ansari A. Huang J.-C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 32.Maldonado E. Shiekhattar R. Sheldon M. Cho H. Drapkin R. Rickert P. Lees E. Anderson C.W. Linn S. Reinberg D.

Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), although conclusive evidence of such interaction has been lacking. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with NER-proficient human cell extracts and an antibody raised against cyclin H, which is one of the components of TFIIH. As shown in Fig.1, not only XPB and p62, two other subunits of TFIIH, but also XPC were detected in the fraction precipitated by anti-cyclin H antibody (lane 3) but not with the control antibody (lane 2). On the other hand, no clear evidence to imply the interaction between TFIIH and XPA nor RPA was obtained. This result indicated that XPC interacted with TFIIH in the whole cell extracts; to examine whether the interaction was direct or mediated by other proteins or DNA present in the cell extracts, co-precipitation experiments were performed using purified proteins. TFIIH purified from HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig.2 C) was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to GST-rHR23B fusion protein that had been preincubated with or without rXPC. Co-precipitation of TFIIH with the Sepharose beads was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-p62 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, p62 was detected in the precipitate fraction in an XPC-dependent manner (comparelane 4 with lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that XPC alone or the XPC-HR23B complex interacted directly with purified TFIIH. This XPC-dependent interaction was also observed using rHR23B-conjugated Sepharose (Fig. 2 B,lane 3). Therefore, we conclude that the XPC-HR23B complex interacts directly with TFIIH in vitro and that XPC is indispensable for this specific interaction. Next, a series of pull-down experiments were performed using the GST-tagged TFIIH subunits to assess which subunit of TFIIH interacted with the XPC-HR23B complex and whether HR23B was necessary for the interaction. As shown in Fig. 3, both the purified XPC-HR23B complex (A) and free rXPC (B) were found to bind XPB and p62. In contrast, rHR23B, rRPA, and rPCNA were not co-precipitated with any of the TFIIH subunits (C–E). These results indicate that the interaction between the XPC-HR23B complex and TFIIH is mediated through specific protein-protein binding (XPC-XPB and/or XPC-p62) and that HR23B is not essential for this interaction.Figure 2Interaction of purified TFIIH with XPC.

The XPC-HR23B complex has a high affinity for both ssDNA and dsDNA (14.Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D.

Thus, not only XPC-HR23B but also those proteins that interact with this complex or which associate with DNA might be expected to be precipitated from whole cell extracts by DNA-cellulose. We therefore examined the presence of not only XPC and TFIIH but also XPA and RPA, which have been characterized as DNA binding NER factors, in DNA-cellulose bound fractions. Because it has been reported that ATP is necessary to form the repair protein complex on DNA (19.Evans E. Moggs J.G. Hwang J.R. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6559-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 20.Wakasugi M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6669-6674Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34.Mu D. Wakasugi M. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28971-28979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we also examined the ATP dependence of the precipitation of TFIIH by DNA-cellulose. XPC, p62, XPA, and RPA32 were detected in the dsDNA-cellulose bound fraction of NER-proficient 293 whole cell extracts, as expected (Fig. 4,lanes 3 and 5). Interestingly, ATP was not required for efficient precipitation of TFIIH by DNA-cellulose from whole cell extracts (lane 3). Moreover, the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP did not alter the amount of any precipitates (lane 6). Evans et al. (19.Evans E. Moggs J.G. Hwang J.R. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6559-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) reported that ATP hydrolysis is necessary for the open complex formation immediately around the lesion. We therefore propose that the initial NER protein complex on DNA may be formed without reliance on ATP, but the initial opening reaction requires ATP. TFIIH has been shown to have little affinity for DNA by itself (20.Wakasugi M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6669-6674Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 35.Nocentini S. Coin F. Saijo M. Tanaka K. Egly J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22991-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed precipitation of TFIIH by dsDNA may be due to specific interaction with other protein(s) bound to DNA or dependent upon conformational changes in DNA induced by DNA-binding proteins. To test the possibility that other NER proteins mediate the interaction between TFIIH and DNA, several precipitation experiments were performed using whole cell extracts derived from NER-deficient cell lines (Fig.5). XPC, p62, and RPA32 were precipitated from XP-A and 293 whole cell extracts (A) with ssDNA-cellulose (lanes 3 and 11) or dsDNA-cellulose (lanes 4 and 12). In contrast, p62 was not recovered in the precipitates from XP-C whole cell extracts, whereas binding of XPA and RPA32 to both ssDNA- and dsDNA-cellulose were unaffected (compare lanes 3 and4 with 7 and 8, respectively). The same results were obtained with extracts from XP-B (GM2252A), XP-D (XP6BESV), XP-G (XP3BRSV), CS-A (CS2OSSV), and CS-B (GM1629SV) cells, all of which express the XPC protein, as with 293 whole cell extracts (data not shown). Intriguingly, ssDNA was insufficient to associate with TFIIH even though XPC binds to ssDNA as well as to dsDNA (Fig.5 A, compare lanes 3, 4, 11, and 12). Furthermore, when the XP-C cell extracts were supplemented with purified XPC-HR23B complex, TFIIH was detected in the precipitate fraction of dsDNA-cellulose (Fig. 5 B). Thus TFIIH stably associated with dsDNA, either directly or indirectly, only in the presence of XPC. It should be noted that extra signals were observed above the bands corresponding to XPA. These extra bands probably represent modified forms of the target proteins, because specific antibodies were used.

In mice, destructive mutations ofTlr4 impede the normal response to LPS and cause a high susceptibility to Gram-negative infection. Expression of TLR4 mRNA in humans is restricted to a small number of cell types, including LPS-responsive myeloid cells, B-cells, and endothelial cells. To investigate the molecular basis for TLR4 expression in cells of myeloid origin, we cloned the human TLR4 gene and analyzed its putative 5′-proximal promoter. In transient transfections a region of only 75 base pairs upstream of the major transcription initiation site was sufficient to induce maximal luciferase activity in THP-1 cells. The sequence of this region is similar in human and mouse TLR4 genes and lacks a TATA box, typical Sp1-sites or CCAAT box sequences. Instead, it contains consensus-binding sites for Ets family transcription factors, octamer-binding factors, and a composite interferon response factor/Ets motif. The activity of the promoter in macrophages was strictly dependent on the integrity of both half sites of the composite interferon response factor/Ets motif, which was constitutively bound by the myeloid and B-cell-specific transcription factor PU.1 and interferon consensus sequence-binding protein. These results indicate that the two tissue-restricted transcription factors PU.1 and interferon consensus sequence-binding protein participate in the basal regulation of human TLR4 in myeloid cells.

Detection of LPS is exquisitely sensitive.

Failure to contain Gram-negative infection and to control pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion can result in septic shock and death (1.Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Annu. Rev.

This finding suggests that TLR4 is, in fact, the transducing subunit of the LPS receptor. Direct measurements of TLR4 activity in macrophages sustain the conclusion, in that modest overexpression of a mutant form of Tlr4, corresponding to that encoded by the codominant Tlr4Lps-d allele present in C3H/HeJ mice, causes a dramatic increase in the LPS EC50 for tumor necrosis factor production. Overexpression of the native protein depresses the LPS EC50. 2X. Du, A. Poltorak, M. Silva, and B. Beutler, submitted for publication.2X. Du, A. Poltorak, M. Silva, and B. Beutler, submitted for publication.Interestingly, TLR4 appears to exist in association with MD-2, an exteriorized protein expressed by monocytic cells (27.Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). It may be that co-expression is required for the LPS transducing activity of TLR4.Historically, a number of mysteries have beset the field of LPS signal transduction. Among these, there has been no molecular explanation for the large interspecific differences in LPS response (28.Berczi I. Bertok L. Bereznai T. Can. J.

TLR4 has thus become a focus of inquiry aimed at understanding each of these phenomena.The transcriptional regulation of TLR4 is a starting point for such an inquiry. Expression of human TLR4 is restricted to a small number of cell types, including endothelial cells, B-cells, and predominantly myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes) (15.Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4380) Google Scholar, 16.Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both the basal level of TLR4 expression and its regulation in myeloid cells may influence responses to LPS and, hence, Gram-negative infection. Accordingly, we have sought to define the TLR4 promoter and to analyze those factors that govern TLR4 gene expression in human macrophages, which are the main LPS-responsive cell type. This analysis has entailed determination of the complete sequence of TLR4 and flanking genomic DNA.DISCUSSIONIn this study we investigated the transcriptional regulation of TLR4 in human macrophages, the main LPS-responsive cell type. We cloned and sequenced 19 kb of the human TLR4 gene, sequenced 91.7 kb of the mouse Tlr4 gene, determined the transcriptional start sites, and identified three alternative splicing forms of human TLR4 in human myeloid cells. Furthermore, we performed an initial characterization of regulatory elements controlling the expression of human TLR4 and defined a minimal proximal promoter that confers full reporter activity in human monocytic THP-1 cells.Gene cloning and sequence comparison revealed the existence of an additional exon (exon II) in the human TLR4 gene, which is not present in the mouse gene. Its integration into TLR4 mRNA introduces an in-frame stop codon, which prompted us to investigate the presence and ration of alternative splicing forms of TLR4. By RT-PCR, we were able to detect three alternative splicing variants of hTLR4; however, only one of them encodes the proper TLR4 protein. Although we did not observe major changes in the relative abundance of the three transcripts in myeloid cells, alternative splicing could represent an additional level of TLR4 regulation in humans. Disruptions of alternative splicing have been correlated with some human genetic diseases (67.Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32 (279–305): 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar); mutations that affect the splicing of TLR4 mRNA could favor the expression of noncoding transcripts. It is also possible that alternative splicing events are regulated in response to developmental or physiological cues (67.Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32 (279–305): 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the expression of TLR4 protein could, for example, be switched off, if the second exon is included in all transcripts. However, further investigations will be needed to clarify these issues.Expression of human TLR4 transcripts has primarily been detected in myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells) and some B-cell lines (15.Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4380) Google Scholar, 16.Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). In accordance with the observed cell type restricted expression, the TLR4 gene is controlled by a typical myeloid type promoter in macrophages. The 5′-proximal region lacks a TATA box, consensus initiator sequences, or GC-rich regions found in “housekeeping” genes and instead contains multiple purine-rich sequence motifs that are recognized by transcription factors of the Ets family, including PU.1. The transcription factor PU.1 was shown to be required for the optimal expression of a growing number of myeloid-specific genes (49.Rehli M. Lichanska A. Cassady A.I. Ostrowski M.C. Hume D.A. J.

In human macrophages, PU.1 binds an essential motif in the proximal promoter and recruits ICSBP to an adjacent binding site that is also required for the optimal activity of the promoter.ICSBP is a member of the IRF family of transcription factors and is expressed mainly in cells of hematopoietic origin (71.Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Mak W.H. Marks M.S. Levi B.Z. Flanagan J.R. Appella E. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3743-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).

Because of the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in vivo, ICSBP does not bind to DNA by itself but has been shown to interact with two other IRF family members (IRF-1 and IRF-2) (72.Sharf R.

In addition to its interaction with members of its own gene family, ICSBP and the related lymphoid-restricted factor Pip (ICSAT/IRF-4) are able to form complexes with the Ets family member PU.1 (57.Eisenbeis C.F. Singh H. Storb U. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1377-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). ICSBP (or Pip) protein bind a composite IRF/Ets motif only in the presence of PU.1, and complex formation requires the phosphorylation of PU.1 at serine 148 (57.Eisenbeis C.F. Singh H. Storb U.

The CD20 promoter and immunoglobulin light chain enhancers Eλ2–4λB and Eκ3′ contain IRF/Ets-binding sites that seem to be important for their B-cell-specific regulation and are bound by PU.1 and Pip (57.Eisenbeis C.F.

Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Kim et al. (60.Kim Y.M. Kang H.S. Paik S.G. Pyun K.H. Anderson K.L. Torbett B.E. Choi I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2000-2007PubMed Google Scholar) recently described an ICSBP-binding site that was critical for the activity of the murine 5′-flanking IL-18 promoter. Although ICSBP usually does not bind DNA alone, the authors did not investigate the presence of additional factors in the observed ICSBP-DNA complex. The binding sequence of the IL-18 promoter is similar to other IRF/Ets motifs (Fig. 7 A); it is therefore likely that Ets factors (most likely PU.1) also participate in the regulation of the 5′-flanking IL-18 promoter.We identified a similar site in the human TLR4 promoter and showed that both PU.1 and ICSBP bind to adjacent elements that are indispensable for the full activity of the TLR4 promoter. As expected, formation of the ternary complex is dependent on the presence of PU.1 and its state of phosphorylation. These data suggest that the interaction between the two tissue-specific transcription factors PU.1 and ICSBP is important for the basal activity of the TLR4 promoter in human myeloid cells. Preliminary gel shift analyses using B-cell extracts indicate the presence of a similar complex. 3M. Rehli, unpublished observation. The composite IRF/Ets motif may therefore also contribute to the expression of TLR4 in human B-cells. Using in vitro translated proteins, we observed that the complex between PU.1 and ICSBP migrates slightly faster than the native THP-1 complex. This difference could be due to altered post-translational modifications or an effect of the (5–10-fold) higher total protein concentrations in the preparations ofin vitro translated proteins. However, it is also possible that the native THP-1 complex contains another, as yet unidentified protein.We identified constitutive nuclear ICSBP protein in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 and in vitro differentiated human macrophages, which is consistent with the previously described constitutive expression of ICSBP in the human premonocytic cell line U937. This indicates a more constitutive expression in human macrophages rather than a strictly inducible expression pattern, which is described for mouse macrophages, where constitutive expression of ICSBP is undetectable, and both mRNA and protein levels are strongly induced after stimulation with IFN-γ (62.Politis A.D. Ozato K. Coligan J.E. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2270-2278PubMed Google Scholar). If at all, ICSBP and the IRF/Ets motif in the TLR4 promoter only weakly confer IFN-γ responsiveness. The ICSBP·PU.1 complex was slightly induced by IFN-γ in human macrophages, and in both THP-1 cells and human macrophages, TLR4 mRNA expression was slightly enhanced by IFN-γ priming. However, IFN-γ stimulation did not significantly affect the activity of TLR4 promoter constructs in THP-1 cells. It remains to be clarified whether the observed increase in TLR4 message is regulated on the level of gene transcription or whether other mechanisms (e.g. mRNA stability) mediate the IFN-γ induced increase in TLR4 mRNA.ICSBP-deficient mice show altered antiviral and antibacterial responses and develop a chronic myelogenous leukemia-like syndrome (76.Holtschke T. Lohler J. Kanno Y. Fehr T. Giese N. Rosenbauer F. Lou J. Knobeloch K.P. Gabriele L. Waring J.F. Bachmann M.F. Zinkernagel R.M. Morse H.C. Ozato K. Horak I.

An observed failure to develop Th-1-driven immune responses has been correlated with a defect in IL-12 p40 production by cells of myeloid origin (26.Scharton-Kersten T. Contursi C. Masumi A. Sher A.

Tadesse-Heath L. Contursi C. Epstein S.L. Morse H.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the murineTlr4 gene is similarly dependent on the IRF/Ets motif, which seems to form a less stable complex with ICSBP and PU.1. Analysis of the mouse promoter will clarify whether ICSBP plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of Tlr4 in mice.In conclusion, our observations suggest that a functional cooperation between PU.1 and ICSBP regulates the myeloid expression of TLR4 in humans. Additional elements and mechanisms are likely to contribute to the regulation of TLR4 in health and disease and are the subject to further studies. Transcriptional regulation, alternative splicing events, or function of TLR4 protein could be altered because of mutations or polymorphisms of the TLR4 gene. This study provides the basis for further investigating a possible correlation of yet unknown genetic variations with a higher susceptibility for infection and septic complications. Recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS),1 the abundant glycolipid of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is an important function of innate immune cells. Detection of LPS is exquisitely sensitive. Minute quantities can activate mammalian immune cells (in particular, monocytes and tissue macrophages) that leads to rapid secretion of cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10) and enhanced microbicidal capacities. Failure to contain Gram-negative infection and to control pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion can result in septic shock and death (1.Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Annu. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 417-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Bluethmann H. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3.Ulevitch R.J.

Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar) and is strongly enhanced by LPS-binding protein (5.Tobias P.S. Soldau K.

Multiple signal transduction pathways are activated in macrophages upon LPS stimulation, including the activation of transcription factor NF-κB, nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, protein kinase C, and several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (7.Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). CD14, however, is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein that is unable to transduce the LPS signal through the membrane. The prototypic Toll protein of Drosophila controls dorsal-ventral patterning in the embryo and is required for anti-fungal responses in adult flies (8.Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Hetru C. Curr.

Here we demonstrate that all three Rho family members are involved in CTL- and Fas-induced killing. Dominant-negative mutants of each Rho family member and Clostridium difficile toxin B, an inhibitor of all family members, strongly inhibited the susceptibility of cells to CTL- and Fas-induced apoptosis. Fas-induced caspase-3 activation was inhibited by C. difficile toxin. Activated mutants of each GTPase increased susceptibility to apoptosis, and activation of Cdc42 increased within 5 min of Fas stimulation. In contrast, during the time required for CTL and Fas killing, no apoptosis was produced by dominant-negative or activated mutants or byC. difficile toxin alone. Inhibition of actin polymerization using latrunculin A reduced the ability of constitutively active GTPase mutants to stimulate apoptosis and blocked Fas-induced activation of caspase-3. Furthermore, the ability of Rac to enhance apoptosis was decreased by point mutations reported to block Rac induction of actin polymerization.

Stone N.L. Erhardt J. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), but previous reports present conflicting data about its role in apoptosis induction. Apoptotic signaling pathways can be grouped into two distinct categories (12.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar): mechanisms that induce rapid apoptosis through specific molecules that have evolved to produce cell death (i.e. Fas ligand or cytotoxic T cell granzymes) (12.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar) and pathways that lead to apoptosis when normal homeostatic signaling is disrupted (13.Rawson C.L. Loo D.T. Duimstra J.R. Hedstrom O.R. Schmidt E.E Barnes D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14.Frisch S.M. Francis H. J.

Examples of the latter type of perturbation include serum withdrawal (13.Rawson C.L. Loo D.T. Duimstra J.R. Hedstrom O.R. Schmidt E.E Barnes D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), detachment from extracellular matrix (14.Frisch S.M. Francis H. J.

Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Numerous studies of Rho family signaling in such pathways have revealed that the GTPases play a complex role, participating in both stimulatory and inhibitory paradigms (16.Bazenet C.E. Mota M.A. Rubin L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17.Nishida K. Kaziro Y. Takaya S.

Downstream mediators for positive (i.e.c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1) and negative (i.e. Akt) effects have been identified. In contrast, much less is known about Rho family signaling in apoptosis produced by CTLs, Fas, and other molecules directly inducing apoptosis. Here we show that Rho family GTPases play a stimulatory role in CTL- and Fas-induced apoptosis.The Rho family of small GTPases consists of three proteins (Cdc42, Rac, and Rho) that interact with downstream effectors upon binding to GTP. Their nucleotide state and localization are controlled by >40 currently identified regulatory factors, including guanine nucleotide exchange factors, GDP dissociation inhibitors, and GTPase-activating proteins (19.Bokoch G.M.

Their effects on cell shape are mediated by regulation of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton, and each of the family members has been shown to have different specific effects on actin in studies of fibroblast morphology (31.Hall A.

Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). Rho stimulates formation of stress fibers and impacts on focal adhesion formation; Rac promotes cell ruffles and lamellipodia; and Cdc42 controls the extension of filopodia (34.Chant J. Stowers L. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The Rho GTPases also influence each other's activity: Cdc42 activates Rac and can antagonize Rho activation, and in more limited cases, Rac can activate Rho (33.Nobes C. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar, 34.Chant J. Stowers L. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar).Rho family proteins can coordinate multiple signaling pathways through their ability to regulate both the cytoskeleton and transcription. They induce rearrangements of the actin scaffolding to control the organization and interactions of signaling molecules (35.Kong Y.Y. Fischer K.D. Mariathasan S. Bachmann M. Kozieradski I.

Cell. 1999; 96: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), whereas they directly stimulate transcriptional cascades (24.Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 25.Coso O.A. Cjoaroe M., Yu, J.-C. Teramot H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

They also control the formation of “signaling organelles” such as focal adhesion complexes that affect both extracellular matrix signaling and anchor actin fibers (37.Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Proteins that modulate Rho family nucleotide state contain both catalytic and localization domains (19.Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 346-440Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 21.Cerione R.A.

Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar), indicating that control of cell morphology through localization of Rho family activity is coordinated with activation of downstream pathways. This information suggested to us that the Rho proteins might also regulate the signaling events controlling rapid apoptosis through control of the actin cytoskeleton. We show here that, although Rho family GTPases do not themselves induce rapid cell death, their activity is critical for Fas and CTL death signaling. We also show that Rho proteins modulate CTL and Fas signaling through their effects on the actin cytoskeleton.DISCUSSIONOur results demonstrate that the Rho family proteins play a role in the induction of apoptosis by CTLs and Fas. C. difficiletoxin B, a specific inhibitor of all Rho proteins (48.Just J. Selzer J. Wilson M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), blocks both Fas- and CTL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, transfection with mutants of each family member affects the ability of Fas and CTLs to induce apoptosis; activated mutants stimulate killing, and dominant-negative mutants inhibit it. We also demonstrated that Fas stimulation increases the level of Cdc42 activation within 5 min. Rho proteins are known to control some aspects of apoptotic morphological changes (11.Mills J.C. Stone N.L. Erhardt J. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), so we were careful to establish that the GTPases were not affecting only late stage apoptotic morphological events, but were in fact regulating the induction of apoptosis. This was most conclusively demonstrated by inhibiting Fas activation of caspase-3 using Clostridiumtoxin B. Caspase-3 cleavage and activation are considered to be critical steps in the commitment to apoptosis in Fas-induced cell death (50.Zheng T.S. Schlosser S.F. Dao T. Hingorani R. Crispe I.N. Boyer J.L. Flavell R., A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). More important, we observed that both activated and inhibitory GTPase mutants had no effect on cell death in the absence of apoptotic stimuli, despite their strong influence on CTL- and Fas-induced killing. In summary, these results demonstrate that the Rho family GTPases regulate the induction of apoptosis produced by CTLs and Fas, but that activation alone is not sufficient to produce cell death during the time required for killing by CTLs and Fas.There have been previous reports indicating that Rac plays a role in Fas-induced apoptosis. Rac antisense oligonucleotides and dominant-negative Rac mutants have been shown to inhibit Fas-induced killing of T cells after 3 h (52.Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Brenner B. Sclottmann K. Linderkamp O. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26389-26394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Rac activation by Fas ligand has been demonstrated (52.Gulbins E.

Dominant-negative Rac inhibited apoptosis produced by tumor necrosis factor, whereas dominant-negative Rho had no effect (53.Esteve P. Embade N. Perona R. Jimenez B. del Peso L. Leon J. Arends M. Miki T. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1855-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast to these and the present data, other studies have shown that transfection with activated Cdc42 and Rac alone is sufficient to induce apoptosis in some cells (16.Bazenet C.E. Mota M.A. Rubin L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 51.Chuang T.-H. Hahn K.M. Lee J.-D. Danley D.E. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol.

Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar) and Evan and Littlewood (12.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M.

Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) have pointed out that apoptotic stimuli can be divided into two groups: perturbations of normal homeostasis or stimuli that interact with cellular molecules specifically evolved to induce apoptosis. Perturbations of homeostasis such as growth factor withdrawal (13.Rawson C.L. Loo D.T. Duimstra J.R. Hedstrom O.R. Schmidt E.E Barnes D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), loss of cell-matrix attachment (14.Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar), and DNA damage (15.Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) produce apoptosis much more slowly than direct interaction with apoptosis-inducing molecules such as CTL granzymes, Fas ligand, or tumor necrosis factor. This direct stimulation of apoptotic pathways occurs in minutes to hours. Our measurements of apoptosis due to activation of Rho proteins alone were made at the short times required for CTL and Fas killing. Previous reports examined effects of activated GTPase mutants after 24 h or longer. Thus, our data do not contradict earlier work, but instead indicate that Rho family proteins affect direct induction of apoptosis by mechanisms different from those in apoptosis produced by perturbation of homeostasis.In studies where apoptosis was produced through perturbation of normal homeostasis, both inhibitory and stimulatory activities of Rho GTPases have been reported. Activation of Rac and Rho inhibits apoptosis produced by growth factor deprivation (17.Nishida K. Kaziro Y. Takaya S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 54.Gomez J. Martinez C. Giry M. Garcia A. Rebollo A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2793-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and Rho activation inhibits apoptosis induced by DNA damage (55.Fiorentini C. Matarrese P. Straface E. Falzano L. Fabbri A.

Hahn C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2179-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previously published experiments using activated or inhibitory mutants of Rac, Rho, or Cdc42 indicate that these proteins potentiate apoptosis produced by withdrawal of serum or nerve growth factor (16.Bazenet C.E.

Mechanistic studies have revealed that Cdc42 and Rac induce apoptosis through activation of JNK and/or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades (16.Bazenet C.E. Mota M.A. Rubin L.L.

Takaya S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).The Rho family proteins control the actin cytoskeleton via multiple downstream effectors, resulting in complex localized changes in actin structures and focal adhesions (23.Van Aelst L. D'Sousa-Scorey C. Gen. Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar, 31.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar, 37.Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Our data show that the Rho family proteins alter apoptotic signaling, but cannot themselves induce apoptosis. This is consistent with a mechanism in which Rho proteins alter the cytoskeletal scaffolding required for apoptosis induction and/or affect pathways by which cytoskeletal changes induce apoptosis (35.Kong Y.Y. Fischer K.D. Mariathasan S. Bachmann M. Kozieradski I. Nghiem M.P. Bouchard D. Bernstein A. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2099-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 36.Penninger J. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with recent studies showing that caspases assemble into filamentous cytoplasmic structures during apoptosis (56.Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the extracellular matrix controls apoptotic susceptibility by interacting with focal adhesion components. Rho influences the number and nature of focal adhesions, and both Cdc42 and Rho can induce focal complexes and alter the filamentous actin network anchored to focal adhesions.We tested the involvement of actin in Rho family modulation of apoptotic signaling. Latrunculin, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, strongly affected caspase activation by Fas. Recently published studies have shown that jasplakinolide, a molecule that stabilizes polymerized actin structures, increases apoptosis (57.Posey S.C. Bierer B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4259-4265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Latrunculin blocked the ability of constitutively active Rho family members to enhance CTL- and Fas-induced killing. These experiments indicate that polymerized actin structures are required for apoptosis induction and that Rho family proteins do not operate on a pathway independent of their ability to regulate the actin cytoskeleton. This evidence is consistent with a mechanism in which Rho modulation of actin affects Fas and CTL signaling, possibly through rearrangement of actin scaffolds, alterations in focal adhesion signaling, or cytoskeletal changes accompanying Fas receptor capping. These models are supported by our experiments in which point mutations affecting the ability of Rac to alter cortical actin interfered with its ability to increase apoptosis. The facts that Cdc42 is stimulated rapidly, within 5 min of Fas addition, and that simulation recedes well before caspase activation suggest that Rho proteins participate in early events of receptor-mediated signaling. Previous reports also show rapid activation of Rac by Fas (52.Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Brenner B. Sclottmann K. Linderkamp O. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26389-26394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Our data show a strong correlation between morphological features produced by Rho proteins and susceptibility to apoptosis. This further supports a mechanism in which the Rho GTPases affect apoptosis by modulating the cytoskeleton. Our observations are consistent with previous studies demonstrating a connection between cell shape and susceptibility to apoptosis. Ingber and co-workers (58.Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4144) Google Scholar, 59.Chicurel M.E. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) have elucidated mechanisms by which mechanical stresses control cell death. It was shown that cell shape strongly influences the extent of apoptosis regardless of the total area of contact with cell-surface molecules. Using a system distinct from that utilized in our studies, these workers observed that spread cells were less susceptible to apoptosis. This apparent contradiction suggests that apoptosis requires specific cytoskeletal structures whose formation does not correlate with gross morphological features like the extent of cell spreading.The work described here further dissects the complex multifunctional role of the Rho proteins in apoptosis induction. The mechanisms by which cytoskeletal dynamics impact upon cell signaling remain poorly understood. In future studies, we hope to identify specific actin structures and dynamics involved in apoptosis induction and elucidate their control by Rho family signaling. Apoptosis is a form of “cell suicide” in which cells fragment their cytoplasm, nucleus, and DNA for orderly disposal (1.Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cotter T.G. Trends Biochem.

It is ubiquitous and essential to normal homeostasis in higher animals and is important in modulating immune cell populations for defense against cancer and virus-infected cells (3.Glinsky G.V.

Rev. 1994; 142: 9-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is induced through activation of caspases, which activate one another in a proteolytic cascade (5.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar), leading to cleavage of cytoskeletal and signaling molecules that result in irreversible changes in cell morphology and the plasma membrane (6.Rudel T.

The Rho family of small GTPases plays a role in the terminal morphological changes of apoptosis (11.Mills J.C. Stone N.L. Erhardt J. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), but previous reports present conflicting data about its role in apoptosis induction. Apoptotic signaling pathways can be grouped into two distinct categories (12.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar): mechanisms that induce rapid apoptosis through specific molecules that have evolved to produce cell death (i.e. Fas ligand or cytotoxic T cell granzymes) (12.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar) and pathways that lead to apoptosis when normal homeostatic signaling is disrupted (13.Rawson C.L. Loo D.T. Duimstra J.R. Hedstrom O.R. Schmidt E.E Barnes D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14.Frisch S.M. Francis H. J.

Examples of the latter type of perturbation include serum withdrawal (13.Rawson C.L. Loo D.T. Duimstra J.R. Hedstrom O.R. Schmidt E.E Barnes D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), detachment from extracellular matrix (14.Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar), and an imbalance of survival homeostatic signaling pathways (15.Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Numerous studies of Rho family signaling in such pathways have revealed that the GTPases play a complex role, participating in both stimulatory and inhibitory paradigms (16.Bazenet C.E. Mota M.A. Rubin L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17.Nishida K. Kaziro Y. Takaya S.

Downstream mediators for positive (i.e.c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1) and negative (i.e. Akt) effects have been identified. In contrast, much less is known about Rho family signaling in apoptosis produced by CTLs, Fas, and other molecules directly inducing apoptosis. Here we show that Rho family GTPases play a stimulatory role in CTL- and Fas-induced apoptosis. The Rho family of small GTPases consists of three proteins (Cdc42, Rac, and Rho) that interact with downstream effectors upon binding to GTP. Their nucleotide state and localization are controlled by >40 currently identified regulatory factors, including guanine nucleotide exchange factors, GDP dissociation inhibitors, and GTPase-activating proteins (19.Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abst"
https://openalex.org/W2312333799,"Retinoic acid (RA)-resistance in breast cancer cells has been associated with irreversible loss of retinoic acid receptor beta, RARbeta, gene expression. Search of the causes affecting RARbeta gene activity has been oriented at identifying possible differences either at the level of one of the RARbeta promoters, RARbeta2, or at regulatory factors. We hypothesized that loss of RARbeta2 activity occurs as a result of multiple factors, including epigenetic modifications, which can pattern RARbeta2 chromatin state. Using methylation-specific PCR, we found hypermethylation at RARbeta2 in a significant proportion of both breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors. Treatment of cells with a methylated RARbeta2 promoter, by means of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), led to demethylation within RARbeta2 and expression of RARbeta indicating that DNA methylation is at least one factor, contributing to RARbeta inactivity. However, identically methylated promoters can differentially respond to RA, suggesting that RARbeta2 activity may be associated to different repressive chromatin states. This supposition is supported by the finding that the more stable repressive RARbeta2 state in the RA-resistant MDA-MB-231 cell line can be alleviated by the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), with restoration of RA-induced RARbeta transcription. Thus, chromatin-remodeling drugs might provide a strategy to restore RARbeta activity, and help to overcome the hurdle of RA-resistance in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2006835948,"Many pharmacologically important receptors, including all cytokine receptors, signal via tyrosine (auto)phosphorylation, followed by resetting to their original state through the action of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Establishing the specificity of PTPs for receptor substrates is critical both for understanding how signaling is regulated and for the development of specific PTP inhibitors that act as ligand mimetics. We have set up a systematic approach for finding PTPs that are specific for a receptor and have validated this approach with the insulin receptor kinase. We have tested nearly all known human PTPs (45) in a membrane binding assay, using “substrate-trapping” PTP mutants. These results, combined with secondary dephosphorylation tests, confirm and extend earlier findings that PTP-1b and T-cell PTP are physiological enzymes for the insulin receptor kinase.

Dev. 1994; 4: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinases required for this activity are often recruited upon ligand binding, as in the Jak-Stat pathways utilized by cytokine receptors (growth hormone, interleukin-10, leptin, leukemia inhibitory factor, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon receptors). Alternatively, receptors themselves have kinase activity, like epidermal growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, and insulin receptors. In either case, the receptors are returned to their original state through the activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs).1 Although nearly 50 distinct mammalian PTPs have now been identified (3.Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), assignment of PTPs to receptors and other tyrosine phosphorylated substrates has been slow (4.Tonks N.K. Neel B.G.

In theory, a pharmacological inhibitor of the PTP that is specific for a receptor would act as a receptor agonist. This concept is well illustrated in type II diabetes, where generic PTP inhibitors such as vanadium salts have been known for over a hundred years to restore insulin sensitivity (cited in Ref. 6.Morinville A. Maysinger D. Shaver A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 452-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, a PTP knock-out mouse was recently shown to have increased insulin sensitivity (7.Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A.

Because it is easier to develop drugs that block an enzyme than it is to find ligand agonists and because many of the ligands involved (growth hormone, leptin, insulin, and β-interferon) have therapeutic value, there is considerable interest in identifying specific PTPs for these receptors.

These mutants, like their wild type counterparts, form an enzyme-substrate intermediate involving the conserved PTP cysteine and the tyrosine phosphate of the substrate but are consequently unable to release the dephosphorylated substrate. This approach has been used previously to identify intracellular substrates for PTPs (10.LaMontagne Jr., K.R. Flint A.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Pandergast A.M. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell.

We have cloned the catalytic domains of the (nearly) full set of known human PTPs and expressed them either as wild type or as trapping mutants in glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in bacteria. We have used these PTPs to test their affinity for the autophosphorylated insulin receptor kinase (IRK). Positive PTPs were validated in secondary assays for dephosphorylation of full-length IRK and of an IRK phosphopeptide that contained the tyrosines that are autophosphorylated in the IRK. Oligonucleotides were designed for amplifying the ∼1-kilobase pair catalytic domains of PTPs listed previously (3.Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), plus Lyp-1 (GenBankTM accession numberAF001846), EPMA2/Laforin (accession number AJ130763), and Esp (accession number MMU36488). The sequence of the PTPs corresponded to the entire similarity domain (Ref. 3.Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; available on request). The oligonucleotides were designed to give the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products a 5′ EcoRI site (or a MunI site, if the fragment already had an EcoRI site), and a 3′NotI site, preceded by an artificial stop codon. The oligonucleotides were used in a PCR, using proofreading polymerases and various templates. If available, template was plasmid DNA from expressed sequence tag containing bacteria (Research Genetics). If these could not be used, DNA from various λ cDNA libraries was used, or reverse-transcribed human RNA (CLONTECH). In the latter two cases, nested PCR was performed. The tissue source for RNA or libraries was on the basis of where the PTPs were reportedly expressed or what source their expressed sequence tags, listed in public data bases, came from. The Asp → Ala point mutations (3.Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were introduced using specific oligonucleotides and PCR. The fragments were cloned in-frame into the pGEX4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)EcoRI-NotI sites. The plasmids were transformed into BL21 DE3 (Stratagene). A 0.25-ml overnight culture was expanded at 37 °C in 25 ml of LB until A 600 0.5, induced in 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated a further 3 h at 30 °C. The bacteria were centrifuged, washed in PBS, and taken up in 1.5 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme), followed by three sonications and centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) beads. The beads were recovered by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm (HB4, Sorvall) and washed four times with 5 ml of PBST (PBS plus 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol), followed by two GST-PTP elutions of 100 μl glutathione solution (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm glutathione). The protein concentration was measured (Protein Assay Reagent, Bio-Rad), and the samples were stored in 20% glycerol at −20 °C. 1 μg of GST-PTP was dissolved in 150 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2 mmdithiothreitol) and incubated at room temperature in a 96-well microtiter plate in 20 mm pNPP (Sigma 104 Phosphatase substrate number 104-100). The plates were read atA 405. The wells were scored for the minimal time interval needed to reach an A 405 of 0.2; >24 h is scored as 0, <24 h as 1, <4 h as 2, <1 h as 3, <15 min as 4, <5 min as 5, and <2 min as 6. Human IRK protein (cytoplasmic domain, amino acids D1002-end) was produced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Briefly, aBglI-PstI cDNA fragment encoding the kinase domain was cloned into a derivative of pAc373 (17.Kuroda K. Hauser C. Rott R. Klenk H.D. Doerfler W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1359-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this vector the polyhedrin ATG start codon was mutated into ATC so that translation would start downstream, at the ATG preceding the IRK GAT-codon, which is the first aspartic acid after the transmembrane domain of the receptor. The construct was co-transfected with wild type virus into Sf9 cells, and recombinant virus was identified following several rounds of dot-blot hybridization in serial dilutions. For large scale production, Sf9 cultures were inoculated at 2–3 × 105 cells/ml and grown in 4-liter tanks at 27 °C in TC100 at 50% O2 saturation. Inoculation at MOI 1–10 was at 1.5 × 106 cells/ml and >90% viability, and cells were harvested 45–50 h later. Protein purification was essentially as described (18.Herrera R. Lebwohl D. Garcia de Herreros A. Kallen R.G. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5560-5568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on QAE-Sepharose, followed by CM-Affi-Gel-Blue, Superose 12 and reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography purification steps. For autophosphorylation, protein was incubated for 90 min at 30 °C at 0.05 μg/μl in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP. Although the N terminus was blocked, CNBr digestion and sequencing confirmed the identity of the protein. Nitrocellulose membrane (BA83 0.2 μm, Schleicher & Schuell number 401388) was fitted in a 96-well dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad 170–6545). IRK (0.5 μg in 50 μl of PBS) was incubated for 1 h in each well, followed by 1 h of blocking in 200 μl of washing buffer (PBS, 0.2% Tween-20) plus 5% nonfat milk powder. The GST-PTP protein was incubated at 1 ng/μl (100 μl) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by washing of the wells. The membrane was taken out of the dot-blot apparatus and washed and then blocked in 10 ml of washing buffer plus milk. The membrane was washed again and incubated with anti-GST (mouse monoclonal, 1:1, 500 Santa Cruz sc-138) for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing and incubation with goat anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase (1:1, 500, Dako P0447). Detection was by chemoluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech RPN 2106). GST-PTP (wild type) proteins were incubated at 1 ng in 10 μl with 20 ng of autophosphorylated IRK in 40 mm Tris, pH 7, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The reaction was stopped with 0.4 mm(final) pervanadate after 0.5, 2, 15, or 30 min. The stop solution contained 0.1 m Na3VO4 (Sigma S-6508) and 0.3 m H2O2. The samples were spotted on membrane (BA83 0.2 μm Schleicher & Schuell number 401388), and the blot was blocked in 10 ml of washing buffer (PBS, 0.2% Tween-20) plus 5% nonfat milk powder. The blot was washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:1500, clone 4G10 mouse monoclonal IgG2bκUpstate Biotechnology number 05-321). The blot was washed again and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse antiserum and visualized by ECL as above. Gels (Novex, 4–20%) were run according to the manufacturer's instructions and protein was transfered to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a dry-blot (Bio-Rad) transfer apparatus. Incubation with anti-tyrosine phosphate antibody was as described above. The wild type GST-PTPs (1.5 ng) were incubated with IRK phosphopeptide (GMTRDIY(PO4)- ETDY(PO4)Y(PO4)RKGGKG; Neosystem Labs., Strasbourg, France) in 80 μl of buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm peptide) in 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, 100 μl of Malachite Green Reagent (BioMol) was added, and A 620 was determined on a Labsystems MultiScan Plate Reader. Activities were scored as − for anA 620 < 0.10, + for anA 620 <0.2, ++ for anA 620 < 0.32, and +++ for anA 620 <0.5. The basis for cloning the PTP set was a recent compilation of unique, human PTP catalytic domains (3.Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ∼300 amino acids encoding cDNAs were cloned in-frame in a prokaryotic GST expression vector either as wild type PTP or with the substrate-trapping Asp → Ala mutation, and GST fusion proteins were produced and purified. Table I lists the PTPs, their bacterial expression levels and activities as measured withpNPP, a nonselective PTP substrate. A list with synonyms for the PTPs used can be found elsewhere (3.Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The last column of Table Ilists conserved amino acid sequences found around the two main PTP catalytic centers. The “dual specificity” PTPs, those that also dephosphorylate serine and threonine phosphates (19.Zhang Z.Y. Wu L. Chen L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16088-16096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), are less well conserved, with HCXAG instead of the HCSAG motif found in most “standard” PTPs. In addition, the N-terminal aspartic acid is not embedded in a WPD motif in this subgroup. An interesting finding for the standard (non-dual specificity) PTPs was that the lack of a perfectly conserved WPD motif was closely linked with absence of catalytic activity (PTP-d1, -IA2, - IA2β, -ο, -ς, and I32039). It is possible that these nonfunctional STYX PTPs (20.Wishart M.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Biochem.

Activities on pNPP were scored as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequence motifs are those flanking the conserved aspartic acid (D) and cysteine (C) residues. As a next step, we developed an assay that was based on the ability of the mutants to bind their phosphorylated substrate. IRK was chosen as prototype substrate because it could autophoshorylate in vitro upon incubation with ATP (the protein produced in insect cells was nonphosphorylated). In addition, some PTPs have already been described that dephosphorylate the insulin receptor (21.Mooney R.A. Kulas D.T. Bleyle L.A. Novak J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22.Seely B.L. Staubs P.A. Reichart D.R. Berhanu P. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Kusari J. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which allowed us to validate our approach. Early attempts to design a binding assay with mutant PTP and substrate with GST-PTPs immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were unsuccessful because of nonspecific binding of protein to the beads (data not shown). We then set up an assay whereby IRK was immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane that was sandwiched in a 96-well blot apparatus. After blocking the membrane, each well was incubated with a different GST-PTP trapping mutant, and the whole membrane was incubated with an anti-GST antibody to detect PTPs that had bound to the receptor. As shown in Fig.1, only a few out of the large panel of PTPs that were tested reacted with phospho-IRK, namely TC-PTP, PTP-1b, PTP-γ, and Sap-1. Although the latter two PTPs produced a lower signal, the assay gave a remarkably clear-cut readout. Modifying the concentration of GST-PTPs or the IRK on the membrane did not produce a different positive PTP set (data not shown). Well 25 (Fig. 1) contained GST protein that was directly bound to the membrane (positive control). The IRK samples in the Ctrl box were not autophosphorylated, indicating that binding of positive GST-PTPs to phospho-IRK depended on the latter containing phosphorylated tyrosine. Well 24 was incubated with GST fused with wild type Sap-1, showing that binding depended on the PTPs having a trapping mutation. The results shown in Fig.1 d show that PTP-1b and TC-PTP also only bind as mutants. When a second set of PTPs was tested (Fig. 1 a, lower panel), the PTPs that had tested positive earlier were retested, and these were found to bind reproducibly. The signals on the film were quantified and are shown in Fig. 1 b. The strongest signal was obtained by PTP-1b, followed by TC-PTP, PTP-γ, and Sap-1. As shown in Fig. 1 c, the IRK preparations that were used did not contain any other phosphorylated proteins that could potentially obscure the trapping results. To test whether the wild type version of PTPs that had tested positive in the protein-interaction assay was capable of dephosphorylating IRK, GST-PTP (wild type) was incubated with IRK for variable time intervals. To stop the reaction, we found that pervanadate (23.Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) was more efficient than iodoacetate (24.Bell S.D. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Ellington A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14309-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Samples were spotted on nitrocellulose membrane, and the IRK phosphorylation state was examined using an anti-tyrosine phosphate antibody (Fig. 2). Interestingly, all PTPs that were tested could completely dephosphorylate the receptor, given sufficient time, including a negative control (PTP-PEST) that failed to bind IRK as a trapping mutant. However, the speed of conversion was different, with TC-PTP, PTP-1b, and Sap-1 displaying the fastest conversion. This type of result is similar to an earlier study that identified a substrate for PTP-PEST: the mutant PTP extracted a single substrate (p130 cas), but dephosphorylation of a mixture of cellular phosphoproteins showed only a quantitative difference between activity on p130 cas and other substrates (12.Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, although this enzymatic assay confirmed the specificity of PTPs that have IRK as their substrate, results were much less straightforward than those that were obtained from the nitrocellulose membrane binding assay. Finally, we have tested the set of PTPs for their ability to dephosphorylate a phosphopeptide corresponding to the IRK autophosphorylation site. Like in the IGF-1 receptor, three tyrosines that are substrates for autophosphorylation are clustered in the IRK (25.Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and we designed a peptide that carried all three of these (GMTRDIYETDYYRKGGKG). Dephosphorylation of the triphosphopeptide by each PTP was monitored using a sensitive colorimetric assay for free phosphate (26.Ng D.H. Harder K.W. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F. Johnson P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 179: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the results are listed in Table II. TC-PTP, Sap-1, and PTP-1b all tested positive, but PTP-γ showed no activity, although the same GST-PTP preparation could efficiently convert pNPP (TableI). Interestingly, many other PTPs showed activity, namely DEP-1, GLEPP-1, LAR, PTP-β, -κ, -μ, and SHP-1. The PTPs that best dephosphorylate the phosphopeptide are not simply those that have the highest activity on pNPP (Table I), indicating that the peptide has higher PTP selectivity.Table IIPTP dephosphorylation of an 18-amino acid phosphopeptide carrying three tyrosines autophosphorylated by the IRKPTPInsulinR phosphopeptideScoringOD values from colorimetric assayBDP-1−0.00CD45/LCA−0.00Cdi-1−0.01DEP-1++++0.78FAP-1−0.02GLEPP-1+++0.32HPC-PTP−0.07I32039−0.02IA-2β−0.03LAR+++0.39MKP-1−0.01MKP-2−0.02MKP-5−0.01PEZ−0.04PTEN/MMac-1−0.02PTP-1b+0.10PTP-α−0.01PTP-β+++0.35PTP-δ−0.05PTP-γ−0.01PTP-H1−0.04PTP-IA2−0.02PTP-κ++0.31PTP-μ+++0.38PTP-ο−0.02PTP-PEST+0.14PTP-ρ−0.01PTP-ς−0.01PTP-ζ−0.04Pyst-1−0.02Pyst-2−0.02SAP-1++++0.57SHP-1++0.43TC-PTP++++0.55VHR−0.01 Open table in a new tab The accumulation of new genomic and cDNA sequences is rapidly outpacing the rate at which functions are assigned to genes. It is therefore imperative to devise new, systematic approaches to fit gene products functionally in metabolic and regulatory pathways. PTPs are ideally suited to such an approach. The family is manageable in size, and PTP catalytic domains are easily and unambiguously picked up in computer-assisted similarity searches. In the “PTP screen” described here we have chosen to focus on the catalytic domains of PTPs, because these domains are thought to be sufficient for substrate specificity (27.Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), like kinase domains (28.Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). On the substrate side we have selected the insulin receptor kinase, because it autophosphorylates and may therefore be considered as a physiological PTP substrate. In addition, IRK dephosphorylation has been intensively studied in the past, and those earlier results could serve as a yardstick for our approach. The major candidate PTPs previously implicated in IRK dephosphorylation are PTP-1b and LAR (29.Li P.M. Zhang W.R. Goldstein B.J. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30.Ahmad F. Considine R.V. Goldstein B.J. J. Clin.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Of these, PTP-1b is well established, because a mouse mutated in PTP-1b displayed highly increased insulin sensitivity (7.Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). By contrast, LAR is expressed only at low levels in insulin-responsive tissues (31.Norris K. Norris F. Kono D.H. Vestergaard H. Pedersen O. Theofilopoulos A.N. Moller N.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and LAR knock-out phenotypes have been ambiguous (32.Ren J.M. Li P.M. Zhang W.R. Sweet L.J. Cline G. Shulman G.I. Livingston J.N. Goldstein B.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 33.Schaapveld R.Q. Schepens J.T. Robinson G.W. Attema J. Oerlemans F.T. Fransen J.A. Streuli M. Wieringa B. Hennighausen L. Hendriks W.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). What we have found in our survey is that PTP specificity increased with substrates that were more physiologically relevant. Thus, nearly all PTPs hydrolyzed pNPP, a tyrosine-phosphate mimetic; a subset dephosphorylated an insulin-like peptide and only four (PTP-1b, TC-PTP, PTP-γ, and Sap1) trapped the entire intracellular IRK. Our results confirm that mutant PTP substrate trapping closely mimics physiological dephosphorylation. The binding on filters was inhibited by pervanadate and depended on the phosphatase being mutated and the substrate being phosphorylated. IRK substrate as bound on the nitrocellulose membrane had (at least partially) maintained correct folding, because incubation of nonphosphorylated IRK immobilized on a membrane in suitable ATP-containing buffer resulted in autophosphorylation (data not shown). The membrane binding assay also appeared to be robust in the sense that the set of PTPs testing positive did not depend on incubation time, as in the dephosphorylation assay (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, GST-PTP-γ was reproducibly positive in the membrane binding assay, yet the wild type protein failed to efficiently dephosphorylate IRK. The wild type GST-PTP-γ protein preparation had activity on pNPP and peptide substrates (Tables I and II). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that three tyrosines are involved in IRK autophosphorylation. It is possible that PTP-γ recognizes and dephosphorylates only one or two of these. That might explain why complete dephosphorylation of the IRK is slow, whereas release of free phosphate from the IRK-peptide is efficient. Among the three PTPs that are positive in all three assays, PTP-1b and TC-PTP are structurally very similar (3.Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). TC-PTP is abundantly and widely expressed, but homozygous mice mutated in this gene die soon after birth (34.You-Ten K.E. Muise E.S. Itie A. Michaliszyn E. Wagner J. Jothy S. Lapp W.S. Tremblay M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), so that the function of this PTP is as yet unresolved. Sap1 has very limited tissue expression that does not coincide with IRK expression (35.Seo Y. Matozaki T. Tsuda M. Hayashi Y. Itoh H. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36.Matozaki T. Suzuki T. Uchida T. Inazawa J. Ariyama T. Matsuda K. Horita K. Noguchi H. Mizuno H. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2075-2081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); its involvement in IRK regulation is therefore doubtful. Interestingly, the IRK phosphopeptide that we have used is from a short sequence that is perfectly shared between IRK and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. It is therefore likely that among the set of PTPs that had tested positive in Table II are some that (also) have autophosphorylated insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor as their substrate. Overall, we conclude that the combination of our membrane binding assay and activity tests, as applied to a large panel of PTPs, is a reliable first step in identifying potential substrates. The resulting small PTP set has then to be further evaluated in terms of intracellular localization of the PTPs (37.Mauro L.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 151-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), their tissue distribution, the effect of overexpression, and, ideally, gene inhibition using antisense or knock-out approaches. Shortening the list of PTP candidates before initiating these elaborate studies by a systematic approach as presented in this work should significantly shorten the path to PTP substrate assignments."

We report here that expression of constitutively active ASK1 (ASK1ΔN) induces neurite outgrowth in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12. We found that p38 and to a lesser extent JNK, but not ERK, were activated by the expression of ASK1ΔN in PC12 cells. ASK1ΔN-induced neurite outgrowth was strongly inhibited by treatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 but not with the MEK inhibitors, suggesting that activation of p38, rather than of ERK, is required for the neurite-inducing activity of ASK1 in PC12 cells. We also observed that ASK1ΔN induced expression of several neuron-specific proteins and phosphorylation of neurofilament proteins, confirming that PC12 cells differentiated into mature neuronal cells by ASK1. Moreover, ASK1ΔN-expressing PC12 cells survived in serum-starved condition. ASK1 thus appears to mediate signals leading to both differentiation and survival of PC12 cells. Together with previous reports indicating that ASK1 functions as a pro-apoptotic signaling intermediate, these results suggest that ASK1 has a broad range of biological activities depending on cell types and/or cellular context.

On treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF),1 PC12 cells differentiate with sympathetic neuron-like characteristics including neurite outgrowth. Upon binding of NGF, the cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase is activated, and the activated kinase in turn activates the small GTP-binding protein Ras followed by sequential phosphorylation and activation of three members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily, MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK)/Raf, MAPK kinase (MAPKK)/MEK, and MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (2.Chao M.V.

Activation of the ERK pathway is thought to play roles during NGF-induced neuronal differentiation, since constitutively active MEK induced neurite outgrowth and selective blockade of the ERK pathway using dominant-negative MEK or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 resulted in inhibition of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (5.Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 6.Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Tachibana T. Dell K. Hattori S. Yoneda Y. Nishida E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that persistence of ERK activation is critical for differentiation of PC12 cells, since transient activation of ERK induced by agents such as EGF is insufficient to induce neurite outgrowth (8.Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 9.Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem.

However, a contradictory finding was recently reported, in which an interfering mutant of the small G protein Rap1 which blocks the sustained phase of ERK activation did not inhibit NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, suggesting that sustained activation of ERK is not necessarily required for NGF-induced neuronal differentiation (11.York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). In another study, NGF-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12D cells, a subline of PC12 cells, was shown to be resistant to the addition of PD98059 (12.Sano M. Kitajima S. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells by treatment with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 was induced in the absence of ERK activation (13.Iwasaki S. Hattori A. Sato M. Tsujimoto M. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17360-17365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These studies strongly suggest that signaling pathways other than the ERK cascade also contribute to neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Candidates for signaling pathways regulating neuronal cell death and differentiation include two different recently identified MAPK cascades that converge on c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; also known as SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase) and p38 MAP kinase. Whereas the ERK signaling cascade is generally involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, JNK and p38 are preferentially activated by cytotoxic stressors such as UV radiation, x-rays, heat shock and osmotic shock, and by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (14.Raingeaud J.

Importantly, activation of the JNK and/or p38 pathway has been observed in response to deprivation of trophic factors in differentiated PC12 cells and other neuronal cells, suggesting the possible involvement of JNK and p38 in neuronal death (17.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar, 18.Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol.

When the JNK pathway was inhibited using a dominant-interfering c-Jun mutant, neuronal death elicited by trophic factor withdrawal was decreased, implying that the JNK pathway is a necessary component of neuronal death induced by trophic factor deprivation. Moreover, mice lacking the JNK3 gene, a member of the JNK family (21.Yang D.D. Kuan C.-Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincón M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), and JunAA mice, in which endogenousJun is replaced by a dominant-negative mutant Junallele (22.Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), were reported to exhibit marked reduction in excitotoxicity-induced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, clearly demonstrating the requirement of JNK activity for neuronal death. More recently, compound mutant mice lacking the JNK1 andJNK2 genes were shown to be embryonic lethal and have severe dysregulation of apoptosis in brain, suggesting that JNK1 and JNK2 regulate region-specific apoptosis during early brain development (23.Kuan C.-Y. Yang D.D. Roy D.R.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). On the other hand, several lines of evidence have suggested that the JNK and p38 pathways are involved in neuronal differentiation. Differentiation of PC12 cells induced by expression of GTPase-deficient, constitutively active forms of the heterotrimeric Gq family members, Gαq and Gα16, was accompanied by persistent activation of JNK but not of ERK (24.Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Butterfield L. Zamarripa J. Blumberg D. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of constitutively activated c-Jun, which partly mimicked the phosphorylated form of the protein, or retrovirus-mediated overexpression of c-Jun induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells independently of upstream signals (25.Leppä S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor and promoter of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, specifically induced prolonged activation of a novel JNK isoform (26.Yao R. Yoshihara M. Osada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18261-18266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, p38 was recently shown to be activated in response to NGF and to be required for NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells (27.Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Morooka T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). More recently, it was reported that p38 was activated by treatment with BMP-2 in PC12 cells and that activation of p38 might be sufficient to induce neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (29.Iwasaki S. Iguchi M. Watanabe K. Hoshino R. Tsujimoto M. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26503-26510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the JNK and p38 pathways mediate important biological signals not only for neuronal cell death but also for neuronal differentiation. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a ubiquitously expressed MAPKKK that activates the SEK1-JNK and MKK3/MKK6-p38 signaling cascades (30.Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ASK1 in epithelial cells in low serum condition induced apoptosis, and in ovarian cancer cells expression of a kinase-inactive mutant of ASK1 inhibited microtubule-interfering agent-induced apoptosis, suggesting that ASK1 plays a role in the mechanism of stress-induced apoptosis (30.Ichijo H.

We recently found that overexpression of ASK1 induced death of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells and primary rat sympathetic neurons (SCGs). Moreover, dominant-negative ASK1 reduced the neuronal death induced by NGF withdrawal from these cells (33.Kanamoto T. Mota M. Takeda K. Rubin L. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Bazenet C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). ASK1 was activated upon treatment with TNF-α or agonistic anti-Fas antibody, and a kinase-inactive mutant of ASK1 reduced TNF-α- and Fas-induced JNK activation and apoptosis, suggesting that ASK1 is a pivotal component in cytokine-induced apoptosis as well (30.Ichijo H.

Considering the involvement of JNK and p38 in neuronal death and differentiation as described above, it is of great interest whether ASK1 mediates signals leading to death or differentiation of undifferentiated PC12 cells. We report here that transient or stable expression of constitutively active ASK1 (ASK1ΔN) induces neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. We found that p38 and to a lesser extent JNK, but not ERK, were activated by expression of ASK1ΔN in PC12 cells. Experiments using MEK inhibitors and a p38 inhibitor suggested a significant contribution of activation of p38, rather than of ERK, to the neurite-inducing activity of ASK1 in PC12 cells. We also found that ASK1ΔN induced expression of several neuron-specific proteins and phosphorylation of neurofilament proteins, confirming that PC12 cells differentiated into mature neuronal cells by expression of ASK1ΔN. Moreover, we found that ASK1ΔN-expressing PC12 cells survived in serum-starved condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that ASK1 may mediate signals leading to both differentiation and survival of undifferentiated PC12 cells. Wild-type (WT)-PC12 cells were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (HS), and 100 units/ml penicillin G in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Rat monoclonal antibody to the hemagglutinin (HA) tag (clone 3F10) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-SAPK/JNK polyclonal antibody, anti-ERK polyclonal antibody, and phospho-specific polyclonal antibodies to p38 MAP kinase (Thr-180/Tyr-182) and SAPK/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) were purchased from New England Biolabs. Phospho-specific polyclonal antibody to ERK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) was purchased from Promega. Anti-p38 MAP kinase goat polyclonal antibody (C-20-G), anti-neurofilament medium subunits (NF-M) polyclonal antibody, and anti-Tau monoclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Affiniti Research Products Ltd., and Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Monoclonal antibody to neurofilament heavy subunits (NF-H) clone RMO-24, which specifically recognizes a phosphate-dependent epitope in the tail domain of NF-H (36.Lee V.M.-Y. Carden M.J. Schlaepfer W.W. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3474-3488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Carden M.J. Trojanowski J.Q. Schlaepfer W.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3489-3504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Anti-NF-H monoclonal antibody clone N52, which recognizes phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated NF-H, and anti-β-tubulin isotype III monoclonal antibody were purchased from Sigma. SB203580, PD98059, and U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem, New England Biolabs, and Promega, respectively. Mouse 2.5S NGF was purchased from Takara. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding HA-tagged ASK1 mutants and β-galactosidase were constructed as described (31.Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). Nearly 100% infection of recombinant adenoviruses to PC12 cells can be achieved at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100 as determined by β-galactosidase staining (data not shown). The hygromycin resistance gene derived from pBHMr and the neomycin resistance gene derived from pABWN were each subcloned into pTet-tTAk plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.) and pTet-Splice (Life Technologies, Inc.) and named pTet-tTAk-hyg and pTet-Splice-neo, respectively. The cDNA for HA-tagged ASK1ΔN (HA-ASK1ΔN) was then subcloned into pTet-Splice-neo. The pTet-tTAk-hyg plasmid was transfected into PC12 cells using DMRIE-C (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The cells were then selected with 240 units/ml hygromycin B (Wako), and several hygromycin-resistant clones were established. A clone termed PC12-tTA was further transfected with pTet-Splice-neo-based expression vector for HA-ASK1ΔN. After selection with 400 μg/ml neomycin (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) and 240 units/ml hygromycin, the double-resistant clones were established and analyzed for the expression of HA-ASK1ΔN proteins by Western blot. The cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 10% HS, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 500 ng/ml Tet (Sigma), 120 units/ml hygromycin, and 200 μg/ml neomycin. Approximately 1 × 105 WT-PC12 cells per well were plated in 6-well cell culture plates (Becton Dickinson Labware) coated with bovine type IV collagen (Cellmatrix, Nitta Gelatin) and allowed to grow in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 10% HS for overnight. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and refed with DMEM containing 1% HS and a recombinant adenovirus encoding HA-ASK1ΔN or β-galactosidase. Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were washed with PBS and further cultured in DMEM containing 1% HS for an additional 48 h. In the case of PC12-ASK1ΔN cells, approximately 1 × 105 cells per well were plated in type IV collagen-coated 6-well cell culture plates and allowed to grow in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 10% HS, and 500 ng/ml Tet overnight. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and refed with DMEM containing 1% HS and given concentrations of Tet. To determine the percentage of neurite-bearing cells, the number of cells with a process longer than one cell diameter was determined and compared with the total number of cells counted. Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, and cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation. To detect the expression of neuronal marker proteins, cells were lysed in the same lysis buffer except with the concentration of SDS increased to 1% and sonicated briefly before clarification by centrifugation. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using a DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad), and the same amounts of protein were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h, the membranes were probed with antibodies. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Approximately 5 × 104PC12-ASK1ΔN cells per well were plated in type IV collagen-coated 24-well cell culture plates and allowed to grow in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 10% HS, and 500 ng/ml Tet overnight. The cells were washed twice with PBS and refed with serum-free DMEM containing given concentrations of Tet (day 0). Using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay-based Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo), relative cell numbers were determined in triplicate by estimating the value of day 0 as 1. To investigate the roles played by ASK1 in neuronal cells, we examined the effect of expression of ASK1ΔN, a constitutively active mutant of ASK1 (31.Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar), in PC12 cells. First, wild-type (WT)-PC12 cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses encoding hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged ASK1ΔN (Ad-ASK1ΔN) or β-galactosidase (Ad-β-galactosidase) in culture medium containing 1% horse serum (HS). Nearly 100% infection of recombinant adenoviruses to WT-PC12 cells was achieved at an m.o.i. of 100 as determined by β-galactosidase staining (data not shown). With Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody, expression of ASK1ΔN was detected in an m.o.i.-dependent manner 24 h after infection (Fig. 1 A). Unexpectedly, at this time point, Ad-ASK1ΔN-infected cells began to sprout neurites (data not shown). To confirm the neurite-inducing activity of ASK1, WT-PC12 cells left uninfected or infected with Ad-ASK1ΔN were cultured for 72 h and examined by phase-contrast microscopy. The cells infected with Ad-ASK1ΔN (m.o.i. of 100) exhibited marked extension of neurites (Fig. 1 B, right panel), whereas uninfected cells exhibited no neurite extension (Fig. 1 B, left panel). When cells with a neurite longer than one cell diameter were counted, the percentage of neurite-bearing cells increased by Ad-ASK1ΔN infection in an m.o.i.-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C). Taken together with the observation that infection with Ad-ASK1KM, a recombinant adenovirus encoding a kinase-inactive mutant of ASK1 (31.Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar), or Ad-β-galactosidase failed to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (data not shown), these findings indicate that the neurite outgrowth induced by infection with Ad-ASK1ΔN is dependent on the kinase activity of ASK1. To examine further the roles of ASK1 in PC12 cells, we established a stable cell line expressing HA-tagged ASK1ΔN (PC12-ASK1ΔN cells), in which the expression of ASK1ΔN is under the control of a Tet-repressible promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). After the complete removal of Tet from the culture medium, expression of ASK1ΔN was turned on and first detectable as early as 3 h later by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Twenty-four h after the reduction of Tet in the culture medium, no leaky expression of ASK1ΔN was detected in the presence of Tet (500 ng/ml), and the level of ASK1ΔN expression was tightly controlled by the concentration of Tet (Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 Bshows representative morphology of PC12-ASK1ΔN cells expressing (Tet 0 ng/ml) or not expressing (Tet 500 ng/ml) ASK1ΔN 24 h after the reduction of Tet. The ASK1ΔN-expressing cells exhibited marked extension of neurites, similar to WT-PC12 cells infected with Ad-ASK1ΔN. We next examined the time and concentration effects of Tet on the induction of neurite outgrowth in PC12-ASK1ΔN cells. Twenty-four h after the reduction of Tet, approximately 15% of cells extended neurites with 50 ng/ml Tet (Fig. 2 C). With 0 or 10 ng/ml of Tet, the proportion of neurite-bearing cells increased to approximately 45–50% in parallel with the expression of ASK1ΔN protein detected by Western blot (Fig. 2, A and C). Forty eight h after the reduction of Tet, the proportion of neurite-bearing cells further increased in a time-dependent manner with 50 or 10 ng/ml Tet. However, when Tet was completely removed from the culture medium (Tet 0 ng/ml), the proportion of neurite-bearing cells peaked at 24 h but was decreased at 48 and 72 h. With a longer period of culture (up to 2 weeks), ASK1ΔN-induced neurite outgrowth was found to be most prominent at 10 ng/ml Tet (data not shown). ASK1 activates the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways in COS cells (30.Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). To explore the signaling pathway(s) leading to the induction of neurite outgrowth by ASK1, we examined which MAP kinase cascade is activated in PC12 cells by the expression of ASK1ΔN. To measure the activation status of endogenous ERK, JNK, and p38, we performed Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize the dually phosphorylated active forms of these enzymes. We tested the dose-dependent effect of ASK1ΔN expression on activation of MAPKs in PC12-ASK1ΔN cells 24 h after the reduction of Tet (Fig.3 A). Consistent with our previous report for COS cells (30.Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar), an intense activation of p38 was readily detected with expression of ASK1ΔN. When the same membrane was reprobed with anti-phospho-JNK antibody, intense signals corresponding to phosphorylated p54 and p46 isoforms of JNK were detected in the lysate of sorbitol-treated cells, indicating the presence of intact signaling components leading to JNK in this cell line. Unexpectedly, in contrast to p38, JNK was barely activated by ASK1ΔN; only marginal activation of JNK was detected when an excess amount of ASK1ΔN was expressed at 10 or 0 ng/ml Tet. We detected no clear increase in ERK activation induced by ASK1ΔN on reprobing the same membrane with the anti-phospho-ERK antibody (data not shown; see below). We next examined the time course effects of ASK1ΔN on JNK and p38 in PC12-ASK1ΔN cells (Fig. 3 B). In this experiment, we used the same sets of Tet concentration and time points as those in Fig.2 C, in order to determine the correlation between the ASK1ΔN-induced neurite outgrowth and the activation of downstream MAPKs. With 50 ng/ml Tet, expression of ASK1ΔN increased time-dependently and reached a plateau at 48 h, and constant activation of p38 was maintained from 24 to 72 h. On the other hand, activation of JNK was first detectable 72 h after reduction of Tet. Neither p38 nor JNK was activated in the cells maintained in the presence of Tet (500 ng/ml) throughout the time course of observation. At 10 or 0 ng/ml Tet, activation of p38 peaked at 24 h and decreased thereafter in accordance with the expression level of ASK1ΔN, whereas clear activation of JNK was first detected 48 h after reduction of Tet. The preferential activation of p38 by ASK1ΔN was further confirmed in WT-PC12 cells, which we infected with Ad-ASK1ΔN or Ad-ASK1KM and tested for activation of MAPKs 24 h after infection. Although there was a quantitative difference in the adenovirus-mediated expression of ASK1ΔN and ASK1KM, expression of ASK1ΔN, but not of ASK1KM, clearly activated p38 but not JNK or ERK (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). These observations strongly suggest that ASK1ΔN preferentially activates the p38 pathway in PC12 cells. Furthermore, together with the observation that ASK1ΔN-induced neurite outgrowth was already found within 24 h after the induction of ASK1ΔN, it is likely that p38, rather than JNK or ERK, plays a primary role in ASK1ΔN-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. It has been suggested that activation of the ERK pathway plays crucial roles in NGF-induced neuronal differentiation. Since we did not detect ASK1ΔN-dependent activation of ERK in either WT-PC12 or PC12-ASK1ΔN cells, we examined whether basal activity of ERK is required for ASK1ΔN-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig.4). In PC12-ASK1ΔN cells, a relatively high level of basal phosphorylation of ERK was observed in the presence of 500 ng/ml Tet, but no additional phosphorylation was induced by expression of ASK1ΔN. In the presence of 10 mm each of the MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126, the phosphorylation of ERK was partially and completely inhibited by PD98059 and U0126, respectively. When the percentage of neurite-bearing cells was determined 48 h after the induction of ASK1ΔN in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126 were found to only slightly decrease the number of neurite-bearing cells. Importantly, despite the obvious difference in ERK phosphorylation status, no significant difference was detected between PD98059 and U0126 in ability to modulate ASK1ΔN-induced neurite outgrowth. These results suggest that the ERK pathway makes little contribution, if any, to ASK1ΔN-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cell"

We have probed the accessibility of these cysteines to small and large sulfhydryl reagents. The impermeant hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagent [(2-trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate inhibits transport activity only at two of these positions, weakly at G365C and potently at A364C.

Using a biotinylated maleimide, we found that, among the 14 mutants tested with it, only A364C is accessible to it from the extracellular side. This, together with our previous observations, indicates that the loop—including amino acid residues 354, 359, 373, and 379—is largely intracellular, but a short region of it forms a reentrant pore-loop-like structure, the accessibility of which is dependent on the conformation of the transporter.

A large hydrophobic region (residues 340–490, GLT-1 numbering) is highly conserved not only in the five glutamate transporters but also in small neutral amino acid transporters (24.Arriza J.L.

It contains several amino acid residues that play a key role in glutamate transport (15.Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar, 20.Storck T. Schulte S. Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Initial attempts to determine this topology experimentally revealed strikingly different topologies for this important large hydrophobic region (32.Wahle S. Stoffel W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 33.Slotboom D.J. Lolkema J.S. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31317-31321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is probably because in both studies, inactive truncated constructs fused to reporter groups were employed. Some of the fusion proteins are likely folded in a nonnative conformation. Recently, we have determined the topology of GLT-1, based on the accessibility of functional single cysteine-containing GLT-1 transporters to the biotinylated sulfhydryl reagent 3-N-maleimidyl(propionyl)biocytin (BM)1 (34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We reported that the large highly conserved hydrophobic domain consists of a long intracellular loop, followed by two TMs, TM7 and TM8, which are long enough to span the membrane as α-helices. Between TM7 and TM8, we identified a pore-loop-like structure followed by a hydrophobic linker with many residues accessible from the outside (34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). TM7 contains two residues implied in the binding and/or translocation of potassium (15.Kavanaugh M.P.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14231-14237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The pore-loop-like structure of GLT-1 contains a serine residue, located close to the glutamate binding site and important for sodium selectivity (31.Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). One of the next steps in the study of the structural basis of transporter function is to establish proximity relationships between the TMs. One approach is to create, under oxidative conditions, a disulfide bond between two single cysteines each located at a different TM or loop (35.Sun J. Kemp C.R. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8020-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Such cross-links could be easily detected if the two cysteines are located on different parts of a split transporter (35.Sun J. Kemp C.R. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8020-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,36.Bibi E. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4325-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We decided to perform the split of GLT-1 in the long intracellular loop at position 373. Even though the two parts were expressed, as judged by immunoprecipitation with antibodies raised against epitopes from amino and carboxyl termini, respectively (16.Grunewald M. Kanner B. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 17017-17024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the activity was not restored upon coexpression (data not shown). This would not be expected if the loop was completely intracellular and not interacting with the TMs. Moreover, based on studies with the small impermeant MTSET (37.Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 38.Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) it was reported that residue 395 of the glutamate transporter EAAT-1 (equivalent to residue 393 of GLT-1) is located extracellularly (39.Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Neuron. 1999; 21: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar), rather than at the end of the large intracellular loop (34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to reexamine the topological disposition of this loop using both small and large sulfhydryl reagents. It appears that most of the loop is intracellular, but at least one residue is accessible from the outside by both types of sulfhydryl reagents. Its accessibility is restricted in the presence of glutamate and its analogues. HeLa cells were cultured (40.Keynan S. Suh Y.J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), infected with recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus vTF7–3 (41.Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Data are presented after subtracting the values obtained from cells transfected with the vector Bluescript SK(−) alone. Inhibition experiments with MTS reagents (Toronto Research Chemicals, Downsview, Ontario, Canada) were done as described (30.Zarbiv R. Grunewald M. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were plated in 24-well plates and washed with a medium consisting of 150 mm choline chloride/0.5 mm MgSO4/0.3 mm CaCl2/5 mm KPi, pH 7.4. The cells were then incubated at room temperature with 200 μl of either the above medium or one containing NaCl instead of choline chloride. Other additions are indicated in the legends to Figs. 2, 4, and 5. After 5 min, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of the choline chloride-containing medium, followed by the transport assay, using 200 μl of NaCl-containing transport medium supplemented with 0.4 μCi of the radiolabeled amino acid for each well. Each experiment was performed at least three times.Figure 4Effect of substrate and substrate analogues on the inhibition of A364C by MTSET. A, HeLa cells expressing A364C transporters were preincubated for 5 min in the NaCl-containing transport medium in the absence (control) or presence of 30 μm MTSET. When indicated, 1 mml-glutamate, DHK, d-aspartate, or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was added during the preincubation. The cells were washed twice and assayed for sodium-dependent d-[3H]aspartate uptake for 10 min. The results are given as the percentage of transport in the presence of MTSET (ET) relative to the transport in the absence of the sulfhydryl reagent. Each bar is the mean ± S.E. of a typical experiment done in triplicate. The extent of the protection by glutamate (76% in this experiment) was somewhat variable between experiments, but significant protection (45–80%) was observed in each of the eight experiments performed.B, HeLa cells expressing A364C transporters were preincubated with 30 μm MTSET in the presence and absence (choline replacement) of sodium with and without glutamate as indicated, and this was followed by sodium-dependentd-[3H]aspartate uptake as inA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Effect of MTS reagents on cysteine-less and A393C transporters. d-[3H]Aspartate transport was measured in HeLa cells expressing CL-H and A393C transporters.

After verification of the mutants by testing for the presence of the restriction site engineered together with the mutation, the mutants were subcloned into the original constructs using BsrGI andBstEII. Subcloned DNAs were sequenced in both directions between these two unique restriction sites. In the case of G365C, subcloning was done with AvrII and BstEII. Mutants T360C and S362C were not subcloned. The insert of S362C was sequenced throughout the entire length of the coding region in both directions. In the case of T360C, two independent mutants were tested for transport, with identical results. This was done exactly as described (34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To the eluates from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads was added 6-fold concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol (18%). After SDS-PAGE, they were transferred onto nitrocellulose, and the biotinylated proteins were detected by using streptavidin-peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For each of the mutants, determination of accessibility to BM was performed at least three times. HeLa cells expressing the transporters were surface biotinylated with sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate, and the biotinylated proteins were recovered and processed as described (44.Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Using the cysteine-less GLT-1 (CL-H) with a deca-histidine tail at its carboxyl terminus (30.Zarbiv R. Grunewald M. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14231-14237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) as a parent construct, we have replaced 19 residues of the long loop connecting TM6 with TM7 one at a time by cysteine. After transient expression of the CL-H construct and the cysteine replacement mutants in HeLa cells, transport ofd-[3H]aspartate was monitored. Very little transport (1–10% of CL-H activity) was detected when cysteine was introduced in each of the four consecutive residues from 360–363, and the same was true at positions 357 and 384. In three other mutants—G365C, T370C, and G392C—the activity was somewhat higher (15–25% of CL-H) (Fig. 1). Cysteine replacement at the other 10 positions left significant biological activity, 45–95% of the cysteine-less transporter. Transport activity of CL-H and most of these active mutants, including A393C, was not significantly inhibited by 1 mm of the small impermeant sulfhydryl reagent MTSET (Fig. 2). Similar results were also obtained when sodium was replaced by choline during the preincubation period with the sulfhydryl reagent (data not shown). Only in two cases did MTSET cause a significant inhibition ofd-[3H]aspartate transport, namely in A364C and G365C mutants (Fig. 2). The sensitivity of A364C to MTSET is far greater than that of G365C; MTSET at 30 μm inhibited A364C to the same extent as when it is used at 1 mm (see also Fig. 4), whereas at 100 μm,the inhibition of G365C was only 20% (data not shown). The accessibility of single cysteines of some of the active mutants by the large sulfhydryl reagent BM is illustrated in Fig.3 A. HeLa cells expressing the GLT-1 mutant constructs were reacted with BM. After solubilization of the membrane proteins, the histidine-tagged transporters were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. The covalently bound biotin is readily visualized after SDS-PAGE by probing the blotted proteins with streptavidin-peroxidase. The biotinylated His-tagged wild-type transporter, which contains nine endogenous cysteines, runs as a broad band centered around 64 kDa (Fig. 3 A, lower arrow). It represents an immature form residing in internal membranes that is labeled by BM from the cytoplasmic side (Ref. 34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and see below). The appearance of this band is not suppressed by preincubation with the membrane impermeant MTSET (34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The A364C transporters run as a broad band centered around 72–74 kDa (Fig. 3 A, upper arrow), just as described for the mature plasma membrane form of the transporter (34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It has a lower mobility than the monomeric wild-type transporter (Fig. 3 A, lower arrow). Further evidence for the assignment of plasma membrane and intracellular forms of the transporter is provided by cell surface biotinylation experiments employing the impermeant sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (44.Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which reacts with external lysine residues (Fig. 3 B). Thus, only those transporters accessible from the extracellular medium are biotinylated with this reagent. They were purified using streptavidin-agarose beads. Upon Western blotting with a specific antibody, a broad band centered around 72–74 kDa (Fig. 3 B, upper arrow) was detected, and this represents the mature form of the transporter located in the plasma membrane. It represents only a small fraction of the total transporter pool—most of it is not accessible from the outside. The majority of this pool runs as a 62–64-kDa band (Fig. 3 B, lower arrow). This immature form of the transporter is apparently residing in intracellular membranes. Interestingly, in the experiment depicted in Fig. 3 A, a band corresponding to the immature form of A364C was observed, in addition to the plasma membrane form (Fig. 3 A). Preincubation of the cells expressing A364C transporters with the membrane impermeant sulfhydryl reagent MTSET (37.Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 38.Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) blocks the biotinylation of the plasma membrane form, but not that of the immature transporter (Fig.3 A). Thus, the plasma membrane form of the A364C transporters can be biotinylated from the extracellular side. Neither of these two bands was observed in the cysteine-less transporter (Fig.3 A). In this case, only a number of nonspecific bands lit up; these bands were also observed in HeLa cells expressing the vector pBluescript SK− alone (data not shown). The plasma membrane form of the other active single cysteine transporters was not biotinylated, as exemplified by G365C and A393C (Fig. 3 A). Thus, the stretch surrounding alanine 364 behaves as a reentrant loop, with its apex facing the extracellular medium. At four positions adjacent to alanine 364, 360–363, replacement by cysteine leads to transporters with very low activity (1–10% of CL-H) (Fig. 1). This indicates that this reentrant loop may fulfill an important role in the transport process. Because it is well known that conformational changes accompany glutamate transport (16.Grunewald M. Kanner B. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 17017-17024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,30.Zarbiv R. Grunewald M. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14231-14237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we have investigated the accessibility of A364C transporters to MTSET in the presence and absence of substrates (Fig.4). Preincubation of HeLa cells expressing A364C for 5 min with 30 μm MTSET leads to inhibition of more than 80% ofd-[3H]aspartate transport. Strikingly, when substrates such as l-glutamate or d-aspartate were added to the preincubation medium, a marked protection against the inhibition by the sulfhydryl reagent was observed (Fig. 4 A). The specificity of this effect is illustrated by the fact that γ-aminobutyric acid, which does not interact with GLT-1 (19.Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjoras M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), did not afford any protection. The competitive inhibitor DHK, a nontransportable glutamate analogue, also protected, but to a lower extent (Fig. 4 A). Importantly, in order forl-glutamate to exert its effect, its cosubstrate sodium has also to be present during the preincubation. When it was replaced by choline, no protection by glutamate was observed, and the same was true for DHK (Fig. 4 B). The lack of inhibition of A393C by the nonpermeant MTSET (Fig. 2) is of particular interest, because it has been reported that in a sodium-containing medium, the analogous single cysteine mutant A395C of EAAT-1 is inhibited by it in a glutamate-protectable fashion (39.Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Neuron. 1999; 21: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although not so likely, one possibility to explain this difference between the two transporters is that, in contrast to EAAT-1, modification at this position in the context of GLT-1 is without functional consequences. MTSET does not inhibit A393C-GLT-1 transporters in either a sodium-containing medium or a choline-containing medium (Fig. 5). However, preincubation of A393C-GLT-1 transporters with the permeant MTSEA leads to a significant inhibition, which is potentiated in the absence of sodium (Fig. 5). Clearly, the lack of inhibition of A393C by MTSET is not due to the absence of functional consequences of the insertion of a positive group at position 393. The major new finding reported in this paper is that the glutamate transporter GLT-1 has a new reentrant loop in addition to the one reported previously by us (34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Position 364, located on a largely intracellular loop (34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), is accessible to BM from the outside (Fig.3 A). Thus, it is part of a reentrant loop (Fig.6). It resides in a conserved serine-rich stretch, which appears important for the function of the transporter. Replacement of residues 360–363—all of which are conservative—by cysteine results in greatly impaired transport activity (Fig. 1). Furthermore, modification of the cysteine inserted at position 364 by the impermeant sulfhydryl reagent MTSET also results in the loss of function (Fig. 2). It is possible that also one or more of the residues 360–363 are accessible from the outside, but because the transporters with cysteines in this position are inactive, it is impossible to determine this with the available methodology. Interestingly, in addition to the MTSET sensitive plasma membrane form of A364C, a faster moving band, resistant to inhibition by MTSET is detected (Fig.3 A). The mobility of this resistant form is similar to that of the immature form residing in intracellular organelles (Ref. 34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and Fig. 3 B). Thus, BM, which is capable of crossing the plasma membrane (34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 45.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), can label the internal inside-out form of A364C. Thus, it is likely that the access channel through the transporter is rather wide from the inside, enabling BM to approach residue 364 from that side. It is of interest to note that this faster moving form is not detected in V417C transporters (34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the internal inside-out form, a cysteine in position 417 cannot be approached from the cytoplasm. For the internal transporter to be labeled, BM would have to cross two membranes. This apparently happens at a negligible rate. Thus, valine 417 is located more extracellularly than alanine 364, and this is indicated in Fig. 6. Recently, it was reported that in the related EAAT-1 transporter, there is yet another reentrant loop (39.Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Neuron. 1999; 21: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The activity of mutants with cysteines introduced in positions corresponding to residues 393 and 412 of GLT-1 was sensitive to MTSET. An external location of 412 is in full agreement with our own assignment (34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), but in GLT-1, A393C transporters are not sensitive to the impermeant MTSET but only to permeant MTSEA, especially in the absence of sodium (Fig. 5). Because MTSET is a small molecule, a likely explanation is that in EAAT-1, it can move to a large part of the translocation pathway and react with A393C, located close to the intracellular side of the membrane. On the other hand, this penetration is not possible in GLT-1, perhaps because one or more of the side chains of the amino acid residues lining the permeation pathway are bulkier than their counterparts in EAAT-1. Not only do we not have any evidence for accessibility of A393C to MTSET, it is also not accessible to BM (Fig. 3 A), and thus we conclude that this position is internal, at least in GLT-1. This is in line with all the evidence we obtained previously (34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and thus the stretch connecting positions 393 and 412 forms a transmembrane domain long enough to span the membrane as an α-helix (Ref. 34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and Fig.6). Thus, it appears that GLT-1 has two reentrant loops; the one discovered previously (Fig. 6, loop II) comes from the outside, goes in, and moves out again (34.Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The reentrant loop identified here has the reverse orientation (Fig. 6, loop I). There are some similarities between these two loops: 1) substrates and the nontransportable glutamate analogue DHK protect against the modification of key residues in both loops, A364C (Fig. 4) and S440C (31.Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 2) Both loops contain critical residues. Serine 440 is close to the glutamate binding site and is important for ion selectivity (31.Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas positions 360–363 do not tolerate a conservative replacement by cysteine. It will be of considerable interest to find out in which steps of the translocation cycle they participate. One way to approach this would be to replace those residues by other amino acids, followed by a detailed biochemical and electrophysiological analysis. The presence of reentrant loops is not well documented in transporters but is well established in ion channels (46.MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 889-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The pore-loop of voltage dependent ion channels is a stretch of residues that influences single channel current selectivity among ions and open channel blockade (47.Hartmann H.A. Kirsch G.E. Drewe J.A. Taglialatela M. Joho R.H. Brown A.M. Science. 1991; 251: 942-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 48.Yellen G. Jurman M.E. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1991; 251: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 49.Heginbotham L. Lu Z. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The structure of a related potassium channel containing a pore-loop was recently solved (50.Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Mackinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar). This pore-loop was shown to span only a small part of the width of the membrane. A region critical for the ion selectivity of glutamate receptors also appears to be folded as a pore-loop (51.Kuner T. Wollmuth L.P. Karlin A. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Neuron. 1996; 17: 343-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Even though no significant homology between the reentrant loops of GLT-1 and the pore-loops of ion channels can be detected, it is possible that the loops of GLT-1 are folded in a similar way. It is of interest to note that the substrate protection in A364C, as well as in S440C, is different from that observed in Y403C (40.Keynan S. Suh Y.J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the effects of glutamate and DHK on MTSET inhibition are opposite and are compatible with alternating access of this residue (30.Zarbiv R. Grunewald M. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14231-14237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) Either A364C is directly protected by glutamate and DHK or the effect is an indirect long range conformational change. If the protection is direct, position 364 is close to the substrate binding site, but deeper in the translocation pathway. In this scenario, it might be that positions 364 and 440, residing on different reentrant loops, are close in space. An important future approach will be therefore to determine this proximity relationship and that of other pairs. While this article was in preparation, an article was published documenting the presence of a glutamate sensitive reentrant loop, similar to the one reported here, in a bacterial homologue of GLT-1 (52.Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14282-14287Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2024700991,"The ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) family of GTP-binding proteins are regulators of membrane traffic and the actin cytoskeleton. Both negative and positive regulators of Arf, the centaurin β family of Arf GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors, contain pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and are activated by phosphoinositides.

In contrast to Arf exchange factors, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) specifically activated Arf GAP. D3 phosphorylated phosphoinositides were less effective. Activation involved PtdIns-4,5-P2binding to the PH domain; however, in contrast to the Arf exchange factors and contrary to predictions based on the current paradigm for PH domains as independently functioning recruitment signals, we found the following: (i) the PH domain was dispensable for targeting to PDGF-induced ruffles; (ii) activation and recruitment could be uncoupled; (iii) the PH domain was necessary for activity even in the absence of phospholipids; and (iv) the Arf GAP domain influenced localization and lipid binding of the PH domain.

The relationship between this activity and the normal cellular function of Arf is not clear. The best described activity of Arf is the regulation of membrane traffic (2.Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 3.Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). More recently, potential roles in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton have been identified for Arf1 and Arf6 (4.Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J.

Neither the molecular mechanism by which Arf proteins regulate these pathways nor the means by which Arf itself is regulated have been delineated; however, phospholipids probably function in both capacities. The relationship between Arf and phospholipids is complex. Arf activates phospholipase D and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, resulting in the production of phosphatidic acid (PA) and PtdIns-4,5-P2 (8.Martin A. Brown F.D. Hodgkin M.N. Bradwell A.J.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7688-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides have a role in converting Arf-GTP to Arf-GDP by the centaurin β family of Arf GAPs. Four members of this family have been identified 2T. R. Jackson, L. Foroni, K. Miura, and P. A. Randazzo, manuscript in preparation. (13.Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2338-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and one member of the family, ASAP1 (also called centaurin β4), was purified as an Arf GAP that is coordinately activated by PA and phosphoinositides (13.Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The Arf·PtdIns-P2 complex was found to be the substrate for ASAP1 (12.Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7688-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The centaurin βs themselves contain a PH domain, a likely site of phosphoinositide binding (13.Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,14.Andreev J. Simon J.P. Sabatini D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2338-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides also have a role in the activation of Arf. One family of Arf exchange factors has been found to contain PH domains, and members of this family are activated by phosphoinositides (15.Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These Arf- and phospholipiddependent reactions could establish a system of feedforward and feedback loops that would provide robust regulation of Arf (18.Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 19.Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10758-10763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, such a system would require some means to coordinately regulate the exchange factor and GAP. Phosphoinositide-dependent stimulation of several Arf exchange factors containing PH domains has been examined (15.Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Sakelis C. Patki V.

Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The sequence of the PH domain is most similar to type I PH domains, and, as anticipated based on other type I PH domains, the Arf GEFs have been found to bind PtdInsP3 in preference to PtdIns-4,5-P2 (15.Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Sakelis C. Patki V. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The PH domain mediates recruitment of the exchange factor to membranes and functions independently of the catalytic domain (17.Paris S. Beraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). If, for instance, an Arf mutant that is not recruited to membranes is used as a substrate, phosphoinositides have no effect on activity, and the exchange factor lacking the PH domain is as active as the protein with the PH domain. As has been found for other PH domains, binding to vesicles requires an anionic surface that can be provided by a second acid phospholipid such as phosphatidylserine or PA (16.Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). ASAP1 Arf GAP activity is stimulated by phosphoinositides and PA (13.Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The PH domain is, like the exchange factors, most similar in sequence to type I PH domains (21.Rameh L. Arvidsson A. Carraway III K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.-S. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Therefore, ASAP1 was anticipated to be most efficiently activated by PtdIns-P3, and consequently, the opposing exchange and GAP activities would be activated by the same signal. To determine if this were the case, we have examined the role of phosphoinositides in ASAP1 function, using natural phospholipids and a comprehensive structural set of synthetic phosphoinositides. We found that ASAP1 differs from the previously studied PH domain-containing Arf GEFs in both specific lipid requirements and mechanism of regulation. PtdIns-4,5-P2 more efficiently activated the Arf-GAP than did D3 phosphorylated phosphoinositides. Although the PH domain contributed to membrane targeting, this PH domain influenced Arf GAP activity through additional mechanisms. The PH domain interacted with the Arf GAP domain. PtdIns-P2 binding to the PH domain resulted in a conformational change in the Arf GAP domain. The differences in lipid specificity may explain how the GAPs and GEFs are coordinated. Furthermore, these results indicate that the regulatory mechanism of ASAP1's PH domain differs from the currently accepted paradigm of PH domain function and supports the hypothesis that PH domains can function as allosteric sites. To express the PH domain, ZA and PZA, reading frames for proteins consisting of residues 338–431 (PH domain), 452–724 (referred to here as ZA), and 325–724 (PZA) of ASAP1 were ligated into theNdeI/XhoI sites of pet19c (Novagen) to express histidine-tagged proteins and pet21 (Novagen) to express proteins without additional residues. Proteins were expressed, extracted, and purified over a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (13.Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). His-tagged proteins were further fractionated on HiTrap chelating columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (13.Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed with both the histidine-tagged and the untagged proteins with identical results. Unless otherwise indicated, the results shown were obtained using untagged proteins. To prepare myristoylated PZA, PZA containing the myristoylation site of PKA (GNAAAAKKGSEQES) was constructed by polymerase chain reaction using primers that included the sequence encoding the myristoylation site. The fusion protein was coexpressed with n-myristoyl transferase as described for Arf (23.Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Myristoylated PZA was extracted from inclusion bodies in 7 m urea and was refolded by diluting the protein 50-fold, to a concentration of 0.014 mg/ml, into 20 mm Tris, PH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 containing 0.1% Triton X-100 1 h prior to use in the GAP assay. Nonmyristoylated Arf (24.Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods. Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and myristoylated Arf (25.Randazzo P.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. Expression vectors for ASAP1 tagged with the Myc and FLAG epitopes are described (13.Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were removed from plates using trypsin/EDTA and replated in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with no serum on fibronectin-coated coverslips. After an additional 5–7-h incubation, the cells were treated with PDGF for 5 min and fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence as described (4.Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J.

Actin was labeled with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.). All mutants were derived from ASAP1b (GenBankTM accession no. AF075462). To assist in selecting residues for site-directed mutagenesis, the PH domain was compared with other PH domains (Fig. 3 C), and a homology model of the PH domain of ASAP1, based on the βARK PH domain, was constructed (Fig.3 D). Based on comparison with pleckstrin, PLC-δ, and Btk, lysine 348 was anticipated to contribute to binding PtdIns-P2 and PtdIns-P3; lysine 355 to binding PtdIns-P2; and arginine 360, which aligns with arginine 28 of Btk, to binding PtdIns-P3. Lysine 365 is not conserved among the PH domains that have been characterized, although mutation of a threonine residue at this position in Btk is inactivating (27.Hyvonen M. Saraste M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3396-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced as described (13.Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A.

The mutations were in residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein or on the interior surface of a possible inositide binding pocket (Fig. 3 D) and, based on solubility and chromatographic behavior, had no gross structural effects. Furthermore, the far-UV CD spectra of the mutants were indistinguishable from wild type PZA, which, based on the deconvoluted spectra, was 17% α-helix, 27% β-sheet, 22% turn, and 35% undefined secondary structure. Truncations were accomplished by polymerase chain reaction using Vent polymerase. Fusion of the FLAG epitope was accomplished by incorporating the appropriate sequence in an oligonucleotide used for polymerase chain reaction. Mutations were verified by sequencing using an ABI 373 instrument with Perkin-Elmer reagents. All lipids purified from mammalian sources, including bovine brain PtdIns-4P and PtdIns-4,5-P2, were obtained from Sigma. Bovine brain PtdIns-P2 was also obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. D3 phosphorylated phosphoinositides, including PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, were prepared by unambiguous asymmetric synthesis and characterized fully using methods developed previously at Nutrimed Biotech (28.Aneja S.G.

All synthetics had the absolute stereochemical structure 1-d-1-(1,2-difatty acyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)-myo-inositol, identical with that of the cellular phosphoinositides. The molecular species examined were the 1,2-dipalmitoyl and 1,2-dioctanoyl type phosphoinositides. Comparisons between proteins were made using a single batch of lipids. Comparisons between phosphoinositide isomers were done with multiple batches of each. Qualitative results were batch-independent. Vesicles (32.Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H.

J. 1997; 324: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. Eight micrograms of the indicated proteins were incubated with 50 ng of trypsin in 20 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm GTP, 0.1% Triton X-100, 360 μm phosphatidic acid, and a 50 μmconcentration of the indicated phosphoinositide in a total volume of 25 μl at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 ng of trypsin inhibitor from egg. The proteins were fractionated on 10–18% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in SDS and visualized with a colloidal blue stain (Owl Scientific). The secondary and tertiary structure of recombinant PZA proteins was evaluated by CD spectroscopy in the far-UV (185–260-nm) region. Concentrated stock solutions of protein were diluted to 100 μg/ml with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Spectra were recorded on a JASCO model J-715 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Easton, MD) at room temperature using 1-mm path length quartz cuvettes. Four consecutive scans were accumulated, and the average spectra were stored. The spectra were deconvoluted using the program Selcon. The sequences of all PH domains whose structures have been solved (Protein Data Bank accession codes 1AWE,1BAK, 1DYN, 1MAI, 1MPH, 1PLS, 1 PMS, and 2DYN) were aligned with the sequence of the PH domain of ASAP1. The four PH domain structures whose sequence alignments had the highest identity and similarity scores (1BAK, 1MAI, 1MPH, and 1PLS) were used to generate homology model structures for the ASAP1 PH domain using GeneMine software (Molecular Applications Group, Palo Alto, CA) (33.Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 507-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The protein threading algorithm Profiles3D (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) (34.Bowie J.U. Luthy R. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 253: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar) was used to assess the plausibility of the three-dimensional structure of each homology model generated. The PH domain of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2, or βARK1 (1BAK) (35.Fushman D. Najmabadi-Haske T. Cahill S. Zheng J. LeVine III, H. Cowburn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2835-2841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), scored highest and was used to aid the selection of potential mutation sites on the surface of the ASAP1 PH domain. Amino acid sequences corresponding to the PH domains of a number of known D3 phosphoinositide-binding proteins were aligned with equivalent sequences from ASAP1/centaurin β4 and PAP1/centaurin β3 as well as other known phosphoinositide binding PH domains including PLCδ and spectrin as well as with the N-terminal PH domain from pleckstrin itself. The alignment was performed using the Clustalw function of the Multiple Sequence Alignment programs, available on the World Wide Web. GAP activity was measured as described (19.Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10758-10763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid binding to Arf (12.Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7688-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PZA (32.Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gafney P.R.J. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) was determined as described in the same buffer used to measure GAP activity. The amount of PZA bound to vesicles was determined by fractionating the protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue. Protein was quantified by densitometry using NIH Image. Bovine plasma fibronectin was from Sigma. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression and analysis of variance with the Tukey-Kramer post-test, as appropriate, using GraphPad Prism. All experiments were performed at least twice with similar results. Limited proteolysis experiments were performed seven times with PZA and four times with [K348N]PZA with similar results. Representative experiments are shown. Although ASAP1 and Arf exchange factors are both regulated by phosphoinositides, differences in the particular phosphoinositide could provide independent regulation. To examine this possibility, we determined the phospholipid specificity of ASAP1. As previously reported, GAP activity of ASAP1 purified from bovine brain was activated by PtdIns-P2 in the presence of PA (Fig.1 A). The activation was independent of lipid presentation. Similar results were observed whether PtdIns-P2 and PA were in mixed micelles or vesicles (not shown). The stimulation of ASAP1's GAP activity was dependent on both the phosphoinositide head group and the acyl groups. Specificity for PtdIns-4,5-P2 (Fig. 1 B) was observed when comparing dipalmitoyl (diC16) D3 phosphorylated phosphoinositides with diC16PtdIns-4,5-P2 and when comparing PtdIns-4P from bovine brain with PtdIns-4,5-P2 from bovine brain. An effect of the acyl groups was also found. PtdIns-4,5-P2 from bovine brain, which is primarily 1-stearoyl, 2-arachidonoyl, stimulated activity to a greater extent than did dipalmitoyl PtdIns-4,5-P2 (Fig. 1 B), and dioctanoyl PtdIns-4,5-P2 had no effect on activity (not shown). We have examined the mechanism of activation by PtdIns-P2 and the basis for the observed PtdIns-4,5-P2 specificity. The PtdIns-P2 dependence of GAP activity could reflect a requirement for PtdIns-P2 binding to Arf, ASAP1, or both. Previously, PtdIns-P2 binding to Arf was found necessary for GAP activity; mutant Arf proteins with reduced PtdIns-P2 affinity require more PtdIns-P2 for interaction with GAP (12.Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7688-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we tested if PtdIns-P2binding to the PH domain of ASAP1 is also necessary for activity. We used a bacterially expressed protein containing the PH domain, Arf GAP domain, and ANK repeats (henceforth referred to as PZA) to examine the role of PtdIns-4,5-P2 binding to ASAP1. This protein was soluble and, unlike the native protein, stable under the conditions of the binding assay. In addition, using a bacterially expressed recombinant protein eliminated the possible contribution of associated mammalian proteins to phospholipid binding. The GAP activity of PZA was similar to that of the native protein. PtdIns-P2 and PA coordinately stimulated activity (Ref. 13.Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar and Fig.2 A) 10,000-fold (Fig.2 B). PZA and the native protein had similar Arf specificities (13.Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The PZA GAP activity required PtdIns-P2binding to Arf (Fig. 2 C); the EC50 for PtdIns-P2 was increased if mutant Arf proteins with reduced PtdIns-P2 affinity were used as substrates. PZA and the native protein also had similar phosphoinositide specificities (compare Fig. 2, D and E, with Fig. 1 B). PtdIns-P2 purified from bovine brain stimulated activity to a greater extent than did bovine brain PtdIns-4P or diC16PtdIns-4,5-P2; PtdIns-4,5-P2 stimulated activity to a greater extent than did D3 phosphorylated phosphoinositides. Phosphoinositide specificity was the same whether the lipids were presented as mixed micelles (Fig. 2 D) or vesicles (Fig. 2 E) and, therefore, was unlikely to be the result of differences in how the lipids were incorporated into the lipid interface. We began testing the hypothesis that PtdIns-4,5-P2 binding to ASAP1 was necessary for activity by correlating binding with activity. Like activity, PtdIns-P2 binding to PZA was dependent on a second anionic phospholipid (Fig.3 A). In addition, a protein containing the Arf GAP domain and ANK repeats (referred to as ZA) that did not bind PtdIns-P2 (Fig. 3 B) was not active as an Arf GAP in the presence of PtdIns-P2 (Fig.2 B). ZA's lack of activity could be the result of the catalytic domain misfolding. Therefore, to further test the hypothesis that PtdIns-P2 binding to the PH domain stimulates GAP activity, the effects of point mutations in the PH domain that reduced PtdIns-4,5-P2 binding were examined. Four residues were selected: lysine 348, lysine 355, arginine 360, and lysine 365. The mutations did not detectably affect protein folding (see “Experimental Procedures” for the rationale for selecting the residues to be mutated and the structural analysis of the proteins). Examination of these mutant PZAs revealed that alterations in PtdIns-4,5-P2 binding correlated with changes in PtdIns-4,5-P2 dependence of activity (Fig. 3, Eand F, and Table I). PtdIns-4,5-P2 neither bound to nor activated [K348N]PZA or [R360Q]PZA. PtdIns-4,5-P2 binding and activation were reduced in [K355N]PZA relative to the wild type protein. Mutating residue 365 had little or no effect on either PtdIns-4,5-P2binding or PtdIns-4,5-P2-dependent activity."
https://openalex.org/W2031151478,"Platelet function is influenced by the platelet thiol-disulfide balance. Platelet activation resulted in 440% increase in surface protein thiol groups. Two proteins that presented free thiol(s) on the activated platelet surface were protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and glycoprotein 1balpha (GP1balpha). PDI contains two active site dithiols/disulfides. The active sites of 26% of the PDI on resting platelets was in the dithiol form, compared with 81% in the dithiol form on activated platelets. Similarly, GP1balpha presented one or more free thiols on the activated platelet surface but not on resting platelets. Anti-PDI antibodies increased the dissociation constant for binding of vWF to platelets by approximately 50% and PDI and GP1balpha were sufficiently close on the platelet surface to allow fluorescence resonance energy transfer between chromophores attached to PDI and GP1balpha. Incubation of resting platelets with anti-PDI antibodies followed by activation with thrombin enhanced labeling and binding of monoclonal antibodies to the N-terminal region of GP1balpha on the activated platelet surface. These observations indicated that platelet activation triggered reduction of the active site disulfides of PDI and a conformational change in GP1balpha that resulted in exposure of a free thiol(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1991541044,"Members of the MutL family contain a novel nucleotide binding motif near their amino terminus, and theEscherichia coli protein has been found to be a weak ATPase (Ban, C., and Yang, W. (1998) Cell 95, 541–552). Genetic analysis has indicated that substitution of Lys for Glu-32 within this motif of bacterial MutL results in a strong dominant negative phenotype (Aronshtam, A., and Marinus, M. G. (1996) Nucleic Acids Res. 24, 2498–2504). By in vitro comparison of MutL-E32K with the wild type protein, we show the mutant protein to be defective in DNA-activated ATP hydrolysis, as well as MutS- and MutL-dependent activation of the MutH d(GATC) endonuclease and the mismatch repair excision system. MutL-E32K also acts in dominant negative manner in the presence of wild type MutL in vitro, inhibiting the overall mismatch repair reaction, as well as MutH activation. As judged by protein affinity chromatography, MutL and MutL-E32K both support formation of ternary complexes that also contain MutS and MutH or MutS and DNA helicase II. These findings imply that the MutL nucleotide binding center is required for mismatch repair and suggest that the dominant negative behavior of the MutL-E32K mutation is due to the formation of dead-end complexes in which the MutL-E32K protein is unable to transduce a signal from MutS that otherwise results in mismatch-dependent activation of the MutH d(GATC) endonuclease or the unwinding activity of helicase II."

Kaelin Jr., W.G. J. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 15: 3301-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It encodes a protein that plays a key role in regulating cell proliferation (1.Sellers W.R. Kaelin Jr., W.G. J. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 15: 3301-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The Rb protein shares a domain with two other proteins, the p107 and p130 proteins, and they are collectively referred to as pocket proteins (for recent reviews see Refs. 2.Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar and 3.Mulligan G. Jacks T. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 223-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These pocket proteins are critical cellular targets of viral transforming proteins such as the adenoviral E1A protein (4.Nevins J.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 25-32PubMed Google Scholar). Viral transforming proteins induce S phase entry at least in part through the inhibition of pocket proteins function, indicating that pocket proteins are negative regulators of cell proliferation. Indeed, the presence of active Rb prevents cell entry into S phase (5.Qin X.Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). During progression in G1, Rb is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases, first cyclin D/cdk4 or 6 and then cyclin E/cdk2 (6.Planassilva M.D. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 768-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation results in Rb inactivation, thus allowing cells to enter S phase. Many potential targets of Rb for its antiproliferative effects have been proposed (7.Herwig S. Strauss M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 581-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, it is clear at present that one of the major targets of Rb during G1 is the E2F transcription factor (8.Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Ewen M. Sellers W.R. Arany Z. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 742-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Tsai K.Y. Hu Y. Macleod K.F. Crowley D. Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 293-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). E2F is involved in the activation at the G1/S boundary of a subset of genes whose products are required for S phase progression, such as DNA polymerase α, dihydrofolate reductase, or Cdc6 (10.Yan Z. DeGregori J. Shohet R. Leone G. Stillman B. Nevins J.R. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3603-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 11.Hateboer G. Wobst A.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The E2F transcription factor is composed of heterodimers between one E2F protein and one DP protein (for recent reviews see Refs. 13.Johnson D.G. Schneider-Broussard R. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 447-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 14.Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). There are six E2F proteins characterized so far, named E2F1 to E2F6 (15.Trimarchi J.M. Fairchild B. Verona R. Moberg K. Andon N. Lees J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2850-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 16.Morkel M. Wenkel J. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Hagemeier C. Nature. 1997; 390: 567-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The various E2Fs contain a conserved dimerization and DNA-binding domain. Furthermore, apart from E2F6, they also share a C terminus domain responsible for transcriptional activation and pocket protein binding. Each E2F protein can heterodimerize with one of the two DP (DP1 and DP2) proteins known at the moment. The respective role of these complexes in the regulation of specific genes remains unclear. During G1, pocket proteins interact directly with the E2F activation domain and repress its activity (17.Helin K. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6501-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 18.Flemington E.K. Speck S.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6914-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Rb is able to repress E2F1-, E2F2-, E2F3-, and in some cases E2F4-containing complexes, whereas p107 and p130 repress E2F4 and E2F5 (13.Johnson D.G. Schneider-Broussard R. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 447-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of pocket proteins either by phosphorylation, by viral transforming proteins, or, in the case of Rb, by mutations such as those found in tumors leads to the accumulation of free E2F, able to activate transcription. Once recruited to E2F-regulated promoters, pocket proteins act as transcriptional repressors (19.Chow K.N. Starostik P. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repression by pocket proteins is thought to be very important for their activity, because many E2F sites within promoters, such as b-myb or cyclin E promoters, have mainly a negative effect on transcription (20.Lam E.W. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21.Le Cam L. Polanowska J. Fabbrizio E. Olivier M. Philips A. Ng Eaton E. Classon M. Geng Y. Sardet C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1878-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inactivation of pocket proteins relieves their transcriptional repressor functions (19.Chow K.N. Starostik P. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22.Adnane J. Shao Z. Robbins P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8837-8843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Finally, various experiments suggest that a basal unrepressed level of transcription of E2F-regulated genes is sufficient to induce cell transformation (23.Krek W. Xu G. Livingston D.M.

Many mechanisms have been proposed for transcriptional repression by Rb. It is clear that Rb can inhibit the transactivating capacities of E2F1, for example by preventing TBP recruitment by E2F1 (27.Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N. Luo R.X. Zhang S.H. He S. Dean D.C.

Biochem. 1998; 70: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This histone deacetylase could be HDAC1, because Rb interacts directly with HDAC1 through a classical Rb-binding motif used by many viral or cellular proteins, the so-called “LXCXE motif” (31.Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S. Le Villain J.P. Troalen F. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Histone deacetylases or histone acetyltransferases regulate the acetylation of core histones N-terminal tails. Acetylation is generally thought to alter nucleosomes structure, thus allowing transcription (36.Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 37.Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Therefore, histone acetyltransferases are mostly transcriptional co-activators, whereas histone deacetylases are often associated with transcriptional repressors (38.Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Histone modifying enzymes are targeted at specific promoters through their association with specific transcription factors. Unliganded nuclear receptors recruit a histone deacetylase complex through their corepressor N-Cor, which interacts directly with Sin3, a histone deacetylase-associated protein (39.Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 40.Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M.

This complex also contains the highly related RbAp48 and RbAp46 proteins. RbAp48 and RbAp46 are components of many chromatin-remodelling complexes (41.Tyler J.K. Bulger M. Kamakaka R.T. Kobayashi R.

They are generally thought to target histone modifying complexes to nucleosomes, because they can interact directly with histone H4 (44.Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B.

Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these two proteins have been cloned as Rb-associated molecules (47.Qian Y.W. Wang Y.C. Hollingsworth Jr., R.E. Jones D. Ling N. Lee E.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 48.Qian Y.-W. Lee E.Y.-H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25507-25513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Binding of RbAp48 correlates with the ability of Rb to block cell proliferation (47.Qian Y.W. Wang Y.C. Hollingsworth Jr., R.E. Jones D. Ling N. Lee E.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 49.Huang S. Lee W.H. Lee E.Y. Nature. 1991; 350: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, theCaenorhabditis elegans homologues of both Rb and RbAp48 were recently cloned as two proteins that belong to the same Ras-inhibitory pathway (50.Lu X. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Although these studies clearly show that RbAp48 is functionally linked to Rb, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. In an attempt to identify proteins that could be important for transcriptional repression by Rb, we decided to further characterize the Rb-associated histone deacetylase complex. We show here that the Rb-associated histone deacetylase complex could deacetylate nucleosomal substrates. Because purified HDAC1 cannot function on polynucleosomes (51.Hassig C.A. Tong J.K. Fleischer T.C. Owa T. Grable P.G. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), this result indicates that other proteins besides HDAC1 are likely to be present. Indeed, our data indicate that RbAp48 is a component of the histone deacetylase complex recruited by Rb. We also show that in the presence of Rb and HDAC1, RbAp48 was able to associate with E2F1. Taken together, these results suggest that RbAp48 could be involved in the transcriptional repression of E2F-responsive genes that occurs throughout most of G1. Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with glutamax and SAOS2 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose with glutamax, each of them supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. SAOS2 cells were transfected at a density of 3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. The amount of cytomegalovirus promoter in the transfection was kept constant using empty vectors. pCMV HA-RbAp481 was constructed by inserting the RbAp48 coding sequences in frame in the empty vector pCMV 2N3T (a kind gift from Dr. T. Kouzarides). pGEM-RbAp48 is a kind gift from Dr. E. Y. Lee. pCMV E2F1, pCMV Rb 379–928, pCMV HA-HDAC1, pGEX 2T Rb 379–928, and pGEX 2T Rb 379–928 706 C-F (Rb Mut) were described previously (31.Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P.

Trouche D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10493-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Total cell extracts were prepared from transiently transfected SAOS2 cells. Cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete, Roche Diagnostics), and phosphatase inhibitors 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μm okadaic acid) and incubated for 15 min on ice. Samples were cleared by centrifugation, and supernatants were collected and diluted with 0.5 ml of dilution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.4% Nonidet P-40). Extracts were precleared with 20 μl of packed protein A beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C under gentle rotation. Immunoprecipitation was then performed by adding 1 μg of antibody and 20 μl of packed protein A/protein G beads for 1 h at 4 °C under gentle rotation. Beads were then washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.4% Nonidet P-40), and bound proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis. Western blotting was performed by standard procedures and revealed by Lumi-Light Plus Substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For immunoprecipitation of endogenous Rb, 500 μl of Jurkat nuclear extracts (prepared according to Ref. 52.Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1474-1486Crossref Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) were incubated with 5 μg of the anti-Rb antibody (C15G, Santa Cruz) or a control antibody (anti-Flag M2, Kodak) and 20 μl of protein A/protein G beads overnight at 4 °C in buffer D (52.Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1474-1486Crossref Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Expression inEscherichia coli of GST, GST-Rb, and GST-Rb706C-F were performed by standard procedures. Cells were then disrupted by sonication at 4 °C in 20 ml of TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with 1% Triton and protease inhibitors (complete, Roche Diagnostic). The soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation and added to 300 μl of preswollen glutathione agarose beads (Sigma). After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, beads were washed extensively with TBS-1% Triton and TBS. Purification and recovery of the recombinant proteins was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. Beads (corresponding to about 1 μg of fusion proteins) were washed once with washing buffer and preincubated when necessary for 30 min at 4 °C with 1, 3, 10, or 30 μg of either the HDAC1 peptide (SDKRIACEEEFSDSEE), the LXCXE containing SV40 T-antigen peptide (NEENLFCSEEMPSSDD), or an irrelevant peptide (YVEPTKEYDVALLKLDC). Beads were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 25 μl of Jurkat nuclear extracts then washed three times with washing buffer. The presence of RbAp48 was assayed by Western blot analysis. For GST pull-downs followed by deacetylase assays, the reaction was scaled up eight times. Binding of the anti-RbAp48 antibody (11G10, Genetex) or control antibody (anti-Flag M2) to protein A/protein G beads (Sigma) was performed overnight in phosphate-buffered saline. Jurkat nuclear extracts (200 μl for GST pull-down experiments or 500 μl for immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins) were incubated 4 h or overnight with the bead-bound antibodies (20 or 33 μg of antibodies, respectively). This depletion step was performed three times. An aliquot of supernatants from each step was kept to monitor the immunodepletion efficiency by Western blot. Supernatants from the third step were then used for GST pull-down experiments or immunoprecipitations. For histones labeling, Jurkat cells (1.3 × 109) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with3H-labeled acetic acid (25 mCi), trichostatin A (100 ng/ml), and cycloheximide (100 μg/ml). Permeabilized nuclei were treated with micrococcal nuclease, and polynucleosomes were purified using a sucrose gradient by standard methods. Free histones were purified by hydroxyapatite chromatography. Beads from immunoprecipitation of endogenous Rb or GST pull-down experiments were washed twice with TBS and then assayed for deacetylase activity for 2 h at 37 °C using 20,000 cpms of the indicated substrate (purified histones or a peptide as described (53.Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar)). Assays with polynucleosomes were performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, NaCl 20 mm. Assays were performed in duplicate. Trichostatin A (100 ng/ml) was used to check the specificity of the assay. Transcriptional repression by Rb is mediated, at least in part, through a histone deacetylase (29.Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 30.Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C.

Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that the Rb-associated histone deacetylase complex could deacetylate nucleosomal substrates (30.Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). However, these experiments were performed using transiently transfected templates, which are thought not to be correctly arranged in chromatin. To clarify this point, we prepared labeled chromatin from Jurkat cells, and we purified polynucleosomes (Fig. 1 A, fraction 1). We then tested whether the Rb-associated deacetylase complex could deacetylate histones in polynucleosomes. Incubation of Jurkat nuclear extracts with GST-Rb beads led to the retention on beads of significant polynucleosomes deacetylase activity (Fig. 1 B). This retention was specific, because no activity could be seen using control GST beads or beads harboring an inactive point mutant of Rb (RbMut, Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained using fraction 3 (mainly mononucleosomes or dinucleosomes) as a substrate (data not shown). This result indicates that the Rb-associated histone deacetylase complex could deacetylate histones in nucleosomes. Note, however, that the activity was about 10-fold lower than with purified histones as a substrate (data not shown). HDAC1 has been proposed to contact Rb through a direct interaction. Purified HDAC1 is not able to deacetylate polynucleosomal substrates (51.Hassig C.A. Tong J.K. Fleischer T.C. Owa T. Grable P.G. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). One explanation of Fig. 1 results could be that Rb recruits a multimolecular complex containing proteins allowing accessibility of HDAC1 to polynucleosomes, such as the Mi-2 containing complex (54.Tong J.K. Hassig C.A. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1998; 395 (9121): 9179Crossref Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 55.Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the Rb associated histone deacetylase activity could rely on another histone deacetylase that would be active on polynucleosomes. We thus tested by peptide competition experiments whether the Rb-associated histone deacetylase activity relies mainly on HDAC1. HDAC1 is thought to interact directly with Rb through an LXCXE-like motif, a known Rb-binding motif by which a number of viral or cellular proteins interact directly with Rb. Incubation of GST-Rb beads with nuclear extracts resulted in the specific retention of significant histone deacetylase activity assayed using purified histones (Fig. 2). Preincubation of Rb beads with a peptide corresponding to the Rb-binding site of HDAC1 (Fig. 2, HDAC1) led to a strong decrease of the Rb/histone deacetylase interaction, whereas addition of an irrelevant peptide had no effect (Fig. 2, Irr). In the presence of the HDAC1 peptide, the activity was indeed nearly down to background levels (Fig. 2, GST-Rb Mut). The residual activity could be due to residual binding of HDAC1 in the presence of the HDAC1-derived peptide (31.Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S. Le Villain J.P. Troalen F. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that other histone deacetylases interact indirectly with Rb through an LXCXE-containing protein, these data suggest that most, if not all, of the Rb-associated histone deacetylase activity is due to a complex containing HDAC1 or a HDAC1-related protein (for example HDAC2, which is the only other known deacetylase related to HDAC1 in this region). Taken together, results from Figs. 1and 2 suggest that other proteins besides the histone deacetylase are likely to be present within the Rb-associated histone deacetylase complex. Members of the Rb-associated histone deacetylase complex are likely to play an important role in cell cycle control. In an attempt to better define this complex, we first studied the Rb-associated RbAp48 protein. Indeed, RbAp48 is often found within histone deacetylase complexes (41.Tyler J.K. Bulger M. Kamakaka R.T. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6149-6159Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and its binding to Rb appears to be functionally important (47.Qian Y.W. Wang Y.C. Hollingsworth Jr., R.E. Jones D. Ling N. Lee E.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,49.Huang S. Lee W.H. Lee E.Y. Nature. 1991; 350: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 50.Lu X. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Moreover, RbAp48 can interact directly with histone H4 (44.Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 45.Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 96-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 46.Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and so might possibly be involved in targeting HDAC1 to nucleosomes. We reasoned that RbAp48 could be targeted to Rb through the histone deacetylase HDAC1, which is thought to interact directly with Rb (31.Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S. Le Villain J.P. Troalen F. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitations of extracts from transfected cells were used to determine the parameters of the Rb/RbAp48 interaction. Rb negative cells (SAOS2 cells) were transiently transfected with a vector expressing RbAp48 tagged with a HA epitope. Transfected RbAp48 protein was detected by Western blot as a doublet (Fig.3 A). These two bands represent two different phosphorylation states of transfected RbAp48. 2E. Nicolas and D. Trouche, unpublished results. Immunoprecipitation of Rb from extracts transfected with Rb and RbAp48 expression vectors resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of the hypophosphorylated form of RbAp48 (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). This co-immunoprecipitation was specific, because in the absence of transfected Rb, no RbAp48 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Rb antibody (lane 1), although RbAp48 was produced at a similar level (compare lanes 2 and 4). Immunoprecipitation of Rb from cells transfected with Rb, HDAC1, and RbAp48 expression vectors resulted as expected in the co-immunoprecipitation of HDAC1 and RbAp48 (Fig. 3 C,lane 5, top panel). Significantly more RbAp48 (about 4.5-fold more in the experiment shown) was found associated with Rb in the presence of the HDAC1 expression vector than in its absence (compare lanes 3 and 5, top panel), although the levels of transfected RbAp48 (compare lanes 4and 6, top panel) or of Rb (compare lanes 3 and 5, bottom panel) were similar in all samples. This result suggests that the histone deacetylase HDAC1 can mediate the interaction between Rb and RbAp48 in live cells, leading to the formation of a ternary complex containing Rb, HDAC1, and RbAp48. RbAp48 has been cloned as a cellular protein which is specifically retained on a Rb affinity column, and the possibility of direct contacts between Rb and RbAp48 has been shown, at least in vitro (47.Qian Y.W. Wang Y.C. Hollingsworth Jr., R.E. Jones D. Ling N. Lee E.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results (Fig. 3) suggest that the retention of cellular RbAp48 on Rb beads could reflect the binding to Rb of a"

In this study, we analyzed the influence of temperature on TNFα transcription in the Raw 264.7 macrophage cell line during incubation at 37 and 39.5 °C. The initial activation of TNFα transcription in response to endotoxin (LPS) was comparable in the 37 and 39.5 °C cell cultures, peaking within 10 min of LPS stimulation. However, the duration of transcriptional activation was markedly reduced in the 39.5 °C cells (30–60 min) compared with the 37 °C cells (2–4 h). Deletion mapping of the TNFα gene revealed that the proximal 85-nucleotide promoter sequence and the 5′-untranslated region were sufficient for temperature sensitivity. This sequence contains six heat shock response element (HRE) half-sites but no complete HREs. Electrophoretic mobility shift and immunoblot assays demonstrated that nuclear transclocation of heat shock factor (HSF) and its activation to a DNA-binding form occurred in the 39.5 °C cells in the absence of heat shock protein-70 gene activation. The proximal TNFα promoter/5′-untranslated region sequence competed for HSF binding to a classic HRE. Overexpression of HSF-1 reduced activity of the TNFα promoter. These data suggest that partial activation of HSF-1 during exposure to febrile, sub-heat shock temperatures may block TNFα transcription by binding to its proximal promoter or 5′-untranslated region.

Several soluble mediators that are induced by TNFα are negative regulators of further TNFα expression, including prostaglandin E2 (14.Kunkel S.L. Spengler M. May M.A. Spengler R. Larrick J. Remick D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5380-5384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glucocorticoids (15.Beutler B. Oncogenesis. 1990; 2: 9-18Google Scholar), interleukin (IL)-4 (16.Essner R. Rhoades K.

Pathol. 1991; 138: 1097-1101PubMed Google Scholar). We reported that exposing macrophages to febrile range temperatures inhibited TNFα expression as potently as these soluble inhibitors (10.Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Ensor J.E. Wiener S.M. McCrea K.A. Viscardi R.M. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C967-C974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that a physical factor can also act as an endogenous regulator of biological processes. In Raw 264.7 macrophages stimulated with bacterial endotoxin (LPS), TNFα mRNA accumulation and TNFα secretion were attenuated during culture at 40°C as compared with 37 °C cell cultures (10.Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reported that TNFα mRNA was destabilized in the warmer cells (10.Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the extent of transcript destabilization was modest compared with the marked reduction in TNFα mRNA accumulation. This suggested that exposing macrophages to febrile range temperatures may also inhibit TNFα transcription. This hypothesis was addressed by comparing the kinetics of LPS-induced TNFα transcriptional activation in Raw 264.7 cells incubated at 37 and 39.5 °C. Using nuclear run-on assays and transient transfections with a reporter construct driven by the murine TNFα promoter, we showed that febrile range temperature inhibits TNFα transcription, probably through early termination of TNFα transcriptional activation. Further attempts to delineate the mechanism of inhibition indicated that partial activation of heat shock factor (HSF)-1, which has been shown to repress other early response genes (22.Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23.Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably plays a significant role in the inhibition of TNFα transcription caused by exposure to febrile temperatures. A fragment of the mouse TNFα gene from −1080 to +138 nt (relative to the transcription start site) was amplified from a murine TNFβ/TNFα cassette (Dr. V. Jongeneel, Lausanne, Switzerland) by PCR using the primers 5′-GTGCTAGCTTGGTCCATGGGATCCGG-3′ (5′-end; NheI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-TTCGAAGCTTGGAGATGTGGCGCCTTG-3′ (3′-end;HindIII restriction site is underlined). The PCR product was directionally cloned into the NheI/HindIII sites of pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI) and was designated −1080/+138. Deletional constructs were prepared using the same 3′-primer (above) and different 5′-primers (with NheI linker) starting at −244 (−244/+138), −135 (−135/+138), and −85 (−85/+138), respectively. Construct −705 (−705/+138) was made by cutting −1080/+138 at the SacI sites in the plasmid and religating multicloning sequence and at nt −705 in the TNFα 5′-flanking sequence. The sequences of all PCR products were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. A firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (PGL3) and a controlRenilla luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the SV40 promoter (pRL-SV40) were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). A human HSF-1 expression plasmid in pCMV5 has been previously described (23.Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An HSP70 promoter-luciferase construct was kindly provided by H. Wong (University of Cincinnati Medical School, Cincinnati, OH). A full-length TNFα cDNA was generated by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using total RNA from LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells and a commercial 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Life Technologies, Inc.), the 3′-anchor primer provided with the kit, and a TNFα-specific 5′-primer: 5′-CTAGTCTAGAGCTGAGGGACTAGCCAGGAGG-3′. A 175-nt cDNA fragment of murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified from the same cells using the primer pair 5′-GACCCCTTCATTGACCTC-3′ and 5′-TCTCGCTCCTGGAAGATG-3′. These cDNAs were cloned into T-vector (Promega). A plasmid containing a 1.4-kilobase fragment of murine aldolase was provided by Dr. M. Shin (University of Maryland). The Raw 264.7 mouse macrophage cell line was purchased from the American Type Cell Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), pH 7.3 (CRPMI), and containing 10% defined fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in 5% CO2-enriched air. Cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma infection using a commercial assay system (MycoTest; Life Technologies, Inc.), and new cultures were established monthly from frozen stocks. Peritoneal macrophages were obtained from 6–8-week-old male CD-1 mice (Harlan-Sprague, Indianapolis, IN) 4 days after intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml thioglycollate broth (Difco). Cells were collected by peritoneal lavage with 5 ml of 4 °C CRPMI, and macrophages were purified by 2-h plastic adherence. All media and reagents contained less than 0.1 ng/ml endotoxin as determined byLimulus amebocyte lysate assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Falmouth, MA). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Cells were stimulated with LPS that was prepared by trichloroacetic acid precipitation from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (Difco). Raw 264.7 cells (5 × 105/well) were transferred to 24-well polystyrene culture plates (VWR; Plainfield, NJ) in CRPMI plus 10% fetal bovine serum. After overnight incubation, the temperature was adjusted by replacing the medium with 1 ml of fresh CRPMI plus 10% fetal bovine serum prewarmed to 37 or 39.5 °C. The culture plates were then transferred to automatic CO2 incubators certified to have <0.2 °C temperature variation (Forma, Marietta, OH), preincubated for 30 min, and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS. Incubator temperatures were verified by direct measurement with calibrated thermometers. TNFα concentration in culture supernatants was measured by ELISA using paired antibodies and a recombinant mouse TNFα standard from Endogen (Cambridge, MA) as described previously (24.Jiang Q. DeTolla L. Kalvakolanu I. Van Roojien N. Singh I.S. Fitzgerald B. Cross A.S. Hasday J.D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This ELISA detected both TNFα precursor and mature TNFα. In some experiments, cell-associated TNFα was measured by washing the cell monolayers, scraping the cells into 1 ml of fresh CRPMI plus 10% fetal bovine serum, lysing cells with two freeze-thaw cycles, and measuring TNFα in the cleared supernatants by ELISA. To determine if increasing incubation temperature enhanced the clearance of TNFα in macrophage culture supernatants, we analyzed the clearance of exogenous recombinant human TNFα in Raw 264.7 cultures using a two-antibody ELISA (Endogen), which had a lower detection limit for human TNFα of 7 pg/ml and did not cross-react with 10,000 pg/ml murine TNFα. Human TNFα (500 pg/well) was added to 37 and 39.5 °C Raw 264.7 cell cultures 1 h after LPS stimulation. The levels of human TNFα in the culture supernatants were sequentially measured, and the half-life of TNFα was calculated using an iterative exponential curve-fitting algorithm (Deltagraph; SPSS, Chicago, IL). To avoid potential confounding effects caused by the lesser accumulation of endogenous TNFα in the 39.5 °C cultures, sufficient recombinant murine TNFα was added to the 39.5 °C supernatants 4 h after LPS stimulation to reconstitute the TNFα levels achieved in the 37 °C cultures. Evaporation was minimized by humidifying the incubator chamber and sealing the culture dishes with parafilm. Volume loss in all experiments was <5% over 24 h and was not different in the 37 and 39.5 °C cultures. Ten million Raw 264.7 cells were prewarmed and stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS at either 37 or 39.5 °C, and total RNA was sequentially isolated using RNAzol (Tel-test, Friendswood, TX). TNFα and GAPDH mRNA levels were analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (10.Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were prehybridized in QuikHyb (Stratagene) for 15 min at 68 °C; hybridized for 1 h at 68 °C in QuikHyb containing 0.67 μg/ml denatured salmon testes DNA and 32P labeled cDNA probe; washed; and analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). TNFα and GAPDH cDNA inserts were amplified by PCR, gel-purified, and labeled with 32P using a random primer kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were stripped and reprobed with a second radiolabeled cDNA, where indicated, according to standard methods (25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.58Google Scholar). Equal RNA loading was determined by UV visualization and photography of 18 and 28 S ribosomal RNA bands in ethidium bromide-stained gels and Northern blots as well as quantitation of GAPDH housekeeping gene transcripts on Northern blots. TNFα, GAPDH, and aldolase transcription rates were simultaneously measured by nuclear run-on analysis using a modification of our reported method (13.Crawford E.K. Ensor J.E. Kalvakolanu I. Hasday J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21120-21127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ten million Raw 264.7 cells were prewarmed and stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS (time 0) at either 37 or 39.5 °C. Cells were lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.3m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Isolated nuclei were manually counted, and equal numbers from each culture were incubated with 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min at 30 °C. Plasmids containing GAPDH, TNFα, aldolase, or insertless plasmid were alkaline-denatured, transferred to nitrocellulose by vacuum filtration using a slot-blot manifold, and immobilized by baking in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 2 h. Membranes were prehybridized overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon testes DNA and then hybridized at 42 °C for 3 days in prehybridization buffer containing 32P-labeled RNA extracted from the run-on reaction mixtures. Membranes were extensively washed (four washes with 2× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min each and then 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min) and air-dried. The membranes were then analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) before exposure to XAR film. At each time point, TNFα band density was expressed as a ratio to either GAPDH or aldolase band density, and the ratio was normalized to time 0 values. Nuclear extracts from Raw 264.7 cells were prepared according to the method of Schreiber et al. (26.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar), and total protein concentration was measured using a commercial reagent (Bio-Rad) against a bovine serum albumin standard curve. Double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the heat shock response element (HRE) corresponding to −107/−83 of the human HSP70 promoter (27.Mosser D.D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) (5′-GATCTCGGCTGGAATATTCCCGACCTGGCAGCCGA-3′ and the complementary strands was synthesized, annealed, and radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) and [γ-32P]dATP according to the manufacturer's protocol. Competitor double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a consensus TATA sequence was purchased from Promega. Two fragments of the TNFα promoter, spanning nt −135 to +138 and nt −243 to −109 were amplified from plasmid −705/+138 using the following primer pairs: 5′-CTACCGCTTCCTCCACAT-3′ and 5′-GGAGATGTGGCGCCTTG-3′ (−135/+138) and 5′-CCTGGTGGGGACGACG-3′ and 5′-CATGATCTCATGTGGAGGAAG-3′ (−243/−109). The PCR products were gel-purified and quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. EMSA reactions containing 5 μg of nuclear extract, 0.035 pmol of radiolabeled oligonucleotide, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 12% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol in a volume of 20 μl were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Where indicated, excess unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide or PCR product or a 1:20 dilution of anti-HSF-1 antibody (28.Bruce J.L. Chen C. Xie Y. Zhong R. Wang Y. Stevenson A.A. Calderwood S.K. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 36-45PubMed Google Scholar) was incubated with the nuclear extracts for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. The DNA-protein complexes were then electrophoretically resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) and exposed to x-ray film. Band intensities were expressed as percentage of the maximal band intensity for each experiment. Nuclear and whole cell extracts containing 30 μg of total protein were separated on 10% Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions; electrostatically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Stratagene); blocked with 10% dry milk in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.15m NaCl plus 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 4 h at 4 °C; and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-HSF-1 antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Bands were detected using a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, developed with a chemiluminescence detection system (RenaissanceTM; NEN Life Science Products), and exposed to x-ray film. The intensities of the HSF-1 bands were determined by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics) and were expressed as percentage of the maximum band intensity for each experiment. Cells were transfected using FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 4 μg of each test plasmid and 0.5 μg of control (pRL-SV40) plasmid DNA were mixed with 15 μl of FuGene 6 in 100 μl of medium. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then added to cells in 60-mm dishes. After 24 h, the cells were split into 48-well plates. After an additional 24 h, the cells were stimulated with LPS at 37 and 39.5 °C, and reporter gene expression was analyzed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences between two groups of data were analyzed using the unpaired Student t test. Differences among at least two groups were tested using the Fisher PLSD test applied to a one-way analysis of variance. LPS treatment induced similar early rates of TNFα secretion in 37 and 39.5 °C cell cultures, but TNFα accumulation peaked and declined several hours earlier in the 39.5 °C culture supernatants (Fig.1 A). These temperature-dependent effects were similar to those previously reported in the same cell line (10.Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in murine astrocytes (29.Velasco S. Tarlow M. Olsen K. Shay J.W. McCracken G.H. Nisen P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages, isolated Kupffer cells, and liver slices (24.Jiang Q. DeTolla L. Kalvakolanu I. Van Roojien N. Singh I.S. Fitzgerald B. Cross A.S. Hasday J.D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if enhanced clearance of TNFα from the culture medium contributed to the reduced accumulation of TNFα in the 39.5 °C culture supernatants, the clearance of exogenous recombinant human TNFα (500 pg/ml) in LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 cell culture supernatants was compared at 37 and 39.5 °C (Fig.1 B). Human TNFα was used as a surrogate for endogenous murine TNFα in these studies because human and mouse TNFα have similar clearance kinetics in vivo (30.Bemelmans M.H. Gouma D.J. Buurman W.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2007-2017PubMed Google Scholar), and the human cytokine is easily distinguished from endogenous murine TNFα with a species-specific ELISA. Human TNFα levels declined at similar rates in the 37 and 39.5 °C culture supernatants, suggesting that the abbreviated accumulation of extracellular TNFα in the 39.5 °C cultures was predominantly caused by reduced TNFα secretion rather than enhanced TNFα clearance. The fraction of total TNFα that remained cell-associated was <5% in 37 and 39.5 °C cells (data not shown), excluding an isolated block in secretion of TNFα protein in the warmer cells. TNFα mRNA was detectable in unstimulated Raw 264.7 cells, but TNFα mRNA levels rapidly increased after LPS treatment (Fig.1 C). TNFα mRNA accumulation paralleled TNFα secretion in 37 and 39.5 °C Raw 264.7 cell cultures. In the 37 °C cells, TNFα mRNA levels peaked between 30 and 60 min after LPS stimulation and returned to base line by 2–4 h after the addition of LPS. These results were comparable with those previously reported in the same cell line (10.Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Taffet S.M. Singhel K.J. Overholtzer J.F. Shurtleff S.A. Cell Immunol. 1989; 120: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the 39.5 °C cells, TNFα mRNA accumulation peaked 30 min after the addition of LPS and returned to base-line levels by 1 h after LPS. These data provide further evidence that the duration of LPS-induced TNFα synthesis is reduced in the 39.5 °C cells and suggest that this effect may be mediated by the availability of TNFα mRNA. We previously reported that TNFα mRNA is less stable in Raw 264.7 macrophages incubated at 40 °C than in 37 °C cell cultures (half-life of 16.0 versus 21.8 min) (10.Ensor J.E. Crawford E.K. Hasday J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1140-C1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this relatively small difference in stability cannot account for the observed differences in TNFα mRNA levels and suggested that transcription must be reduced in the warmer cells. To determine if the magnitude or kinetics of TNFα transcription were influenced by culture temperature, the relative TNFα transcription rates were sequentially measured in LPS-treated Raw 264.7 cells cultured at 37 or 39.5 °C using a nuclear run-on assay (Fig.2 A). Basal TNFα transcription was similar after 30-min preincubation at 37 and 39.5 °C. The addition of LPS caused comparable rapid increases in TNFα transcription rate in both 37 and 39.5 °C cells. Peak TNFα transcription rates were reached 10 min after LPS treatment and were similar in the 37 and 39.5 °C cells, but the warmer cells failed to sustain this rate of TNFα transcription. In the 37 °C cells, the TNFα transcription rate gradually returned to basal levels 2–4 h after the addition of LPS. These kinetics were similar to those reported by Taffet et al. in the same cell line (31.Taffet S.M. Singhel K.J. Overholtzer J.F. Shurtleff S.A. Cell Immunol. 1989; 120: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the 39.5 °C cells, TNFα transcription abruptly and prematurely returned to the basal rate within 30–60 min of stimulation with LPS. Cell viability as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion and transcription of GAPDH were comparable in Raw 264.7 cells incubated for 4 h at 37 or 39.5 °C, suggesting that exposure to the warmer temperature was not toxic and did not cause global transcriptional arrest in these cells. Results were similar when TNFα transcription was normalized to aldolase (data not shown) rather than GAPDH. In primary cultured peritoneal macrophages, basal TNFα transcriptional activity was lower and transcriptional activation was more gradual and more sustained than in Raw 264.7 cells (Fig.2 B), but the pattern of temperature-dependent effects was similar in the two cell types. The ratio of TNFα to GAPDH transcription rates peaked 30–60 min after LPS treatment at levels that were comparable in the 37 and 39.5 °C macrophages, but the subsequent decline in TNFα transcription occurred more rapidly in the 39.5 °C cells. By 4 h after LPS stimulation, the TNFα transcription rate in the 39.5 °C cells was reduced by over half compared with the TNFα transcription rate in the 37 °C cells. To further identify the mechanisms responsible for early deactivation of TNFα transcription in the 39.5 °C cells, we analyzed the influence of incubation temperature on the activity of the TNFα promoter using the firefly/Renilla dual luciferase detection system. We first confirmed that the posttranscriptional processing of the experimental firefly and control Renilla luciferases were comparable in the 37 and 39.5 °C cells by contransfecting both reporter genes driven by the same SV40 promoter. The ratios of firefly to Renilla luciferase activities were consistently similar in cells incubated with LPS for 5 h at 37 and 39.5 °C (43.8 ± 4.3 versus 41.9 ± 3.6). Furthermore, when new transcription was blocked by adding 10 μg/ml actinomycin D during the 5-h culture, the ratio of firefly to Renillaluciferase activities remained similar in the 37°C (14.3 ± 3.5) and 39.5 °C (17.4 ± 5.1) cells. A luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the 1.1-kilobase immediate 5′-flanking region of the murine TNFα gene was constructed and transiently transfected into Raw 264.7 cells, and luciferase expression was compared during 37 and 39.5 °C incubation (Fig. 2 C). This promoter sequence contains four NF-κB response elements, a Y box, an Sp1 site, a TATA box, and a 40-base pair dinucleotide repeat, but lacks an initiator sequence (32.Kuprash D.V. Udalova I.A. Turetskaya R.L. Rice N.R. Nedospasov S.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 97-106PubMed Google Scholar), and it is sufficient to confer responsiveness to a variety of stimuli including LPS, phorbol esters, UV light, and viral infections (33.Beutler B. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1992; 303: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34.Jongeneel C.V. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 35.Drouet C. Shakhov A.N.

In the 37 °C transfectants, LPS treatment stimulated a 3.4-fold increase in luciferase levels c"

Although the physiology of smooth muscle calponin has been studied extensively, thecis-elements governing its restricted pattern of expression have yet to be identified. Here we report on smooth muscle-specific enhancer activity within the first intron of smooth muscle calponin. Sequence analysis revealed a proximal consensus intronic CArG box and two distal intronic CArG-like elements, each of which bound recombinant serum response factor (SRF) as well as immunoreactive SRF from smooth muscle nuclear extracts. Site-directed mutagenesis studies suggested that the consensus CArG box mediates much of the intronic enhancer activity; mutating all three CArG elements abolished the ability of SRF to confer enhancer activity on the smooth muscle calponin promoter. Cotransfecting a dominant-negative SRF construct attenuated smooth muscle-specific enhancer activity, and transducing smooth muscle cells with adenovirus harboring the dominant-negative SRF construct selectively reduced steady-state expression of endogenous smooth muscle calponin.

Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 2.Stull J.T. Gallagher P.G. Herring B.P. Kamm K.E. Hypertension (Dallas). 1991; 17: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In pathophysiological states, the contractile phenotype of SMCs may be subverted to one of growth, migration, and matrix secretion with a coincident reduction in SMC-restricted gene expression (3.Horiuchi A. Nikaido T. Ito K. Zhai Y.-L. Orii A. Taniguchi S. Toki T. Fujii S. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 839-846PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Sobue K. Hayashi K. Nishida W. Horm.

Although the mature phenotype of SMCs can be compromised in a variety of natural and experimental settings, there is evidence for reacquisition of a differentiated phenotype (6.Aikawa M. Sakomura Y. Ueda M. Kimura K. Manabe I. Ishiwata S. Komiyama N. Yamaguchi H. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This process of phenotypic modulation (7.Chamley-Campbell J. Campbell G.R. Ross R. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar) implies that the genetic program of SMC differentiation is not fixed. In an effort to begin understanding the transcriptional programs underlying phenotypic modulation, several SMC-restricted promoters have been studied, including telokin (8.Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1394-C1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); SM22 (9.Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13460-13469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar); and the smooth muscle isoforms of α-actin (10.Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), γ-actin (11.Qian J. Kumar A. Szucsik J.C. Lessard J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and myosin heavy chain (12.Katoh Y. Loukianov E. Kopras E. Zilberman A. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30538-30545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analyzing these and other SMC-restricted gene promoters provides a necessary foundation to identifycis-elements that mediate SMC-restricted gene expression and to ascertain whether such elements and/or their transacting factors are the targets of signals that lead to gene repression in SMC-associated diseases. The CArG box was originally defined as an evolutionarily conserved element (CC(A/T)6GG) found in the 5′-promoter region of the cardiac α-actin gene (13.Minty A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It also forms the core binding sequence of the serum response element, which was first defined in the proximal promoter of the c-fos gene (14.Treisman R. Cell. 1986; 46: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Homodimers of the immediate-early transcription factor, serum response factor (SRF) (15.Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), bind CArG boxes in the regulatory region of viral genes, early growth response genes, and muscle differentiation genes (16.Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although SRF is often stated to be a widely expressed transcription factor, it is particularly enriched in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle lineages during embryonic and postnatal development (17.Croissant J.D. Kim J.H. Eichele G. Goering L. Lough J. Prywes R. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18.Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol.

Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 18-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Many of the highly restricted genes defining SMCs harbor one or more CArG boxes in their 5′-promoter region, and in at least a few cases, the in vivoexpression of these genes is absolutely dependent upon a functional SRF-binding CArG box (20.Li L. Liu Z.C. Mercer B. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21.Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell.

A major effort therefore has been directed toward understanding how a widely expressed transcription factor confers SMC-specific gene activation in vivo. Smooth muscle calponin (SM-Calp) gene expression is highly restricted to SMC lineages in developing and postnatal tissues, making it an ideal model gene to further define the transcriptional program of SMC differentiation (23.Gimona M. Herzog M. Vandekerchkhove J. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 24.Duband J.L. Gimona M. Scatena M. Sartore S. Small J.V. Differentiation. 1993; 55: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 25.Samaha F.F. Ip H.S. Morrisey E.E. Seltzer J. Tang Z. Solway J. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7095-7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although SM-Calp expression is tightly restricted to SMCs, its 5′-promoter region displays promiscuous activity in several non-SMC lineages in vitro (26.Miano J.M. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7095-7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, the same promoter constructs either are inactive or show ectopic (position effect-mediated) expression in transgenic mice. 2J. M. Miano, unpublished observations. These divergent data have led us to hypothesize that cell-specific regulatory elements governing SM-Calp expression lie within the transcription unit itself and/or reside great distances from the core promoter, as has been described for other muscle-restricted genes (27.Donoghue M. Ernst H. Wentworth B. Nadal-Ginard B. Rosenthal N. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1779-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28.Goldhamer D.J. Brunk B.P. Faerman A. King A. Shani M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 637-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Raguz S. Hobbs C. Yague E. Ioannou P.A. Walsh F.S. Antoniou M. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To begin to distinguish between these possibilities, we have analyzed nucleotide sequences 3′ from the preinitiation complex (PIC) of SM-Calp. In this report, we describe SMC-specific enhancer activity within the first intron of SM-Calp that appears to be mediated entirely by several evolutionarily conserved SRF-binding CArG boxes. Using an adenovirus-mediated gene transfer approach, we show that endogenous expression of SM-Calp is dependent upon a functional SRF-CArG box axis. The results are discussed within the context of other SRF-dependent SMC genes and how SRF may mediate such SMC-specific gene expression. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and were maintained in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2). Rat aortic SMCs were isolated from the thoracic aortas of adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (26.Miano J.M. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7095-7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and were used between passages 15 and 25. The A7r5 SMC line (30.Kimes B.W. Brandt B.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, L6 skeletal myoblasts, COS-7, and HeLa cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown according to the supplier's specifications. The PAC1 (31.Rothman A. Kulik T.J. Taubman M.B. Berk B.C. Smith C.W.J. Nadal-Ginard B. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pup aortic cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Stephen M. Schwartz (University of Washington). All SMC lines (rat aortic SMC, A7r5, and PAC1) have been characterized previously and shown to express most of the major markers for SMC identity (32.Firulli A.B. Han D. Kelly-Roloff L. Koteliansky V.E. Schwartz S.M. Olson E.N. Miano J.M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1998; 34: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the first intron of mouse (26.Miano J.M. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7095-7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and human (33.Miano J.M. Krahe R. Garcia E. Elliott J.M. Olson E.N. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 197: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) SM-Calp was performed with an ABI 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Sequences were analyzed with the FASTA and FINDPATTERNS algorithms provided in the GCG Wisconsin Package (Version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). All plasmids were amplified in the XL-Blue strain of bacteria (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and purified by solid-phase anion-exchange chromatography (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). At least two independent plasmids were generated and tested for each reporter construct. The pGL3-basic and pGL3 promoter-luciferase plasmids (Promega, Madison, WI) were used as the backbone for most reporter genes. Two copies of the serum response element from the c-fos promoter (GATGTCCATATTAGGACATC, with the CArG box underlined) linked to a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase minimal promoter in front of pGL2 was used as a control plasmid to test the activity of a dominant-negative SRF construct (see below). The −549CalpLuc reporter was described previously (26.Miano J.M. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7095-7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To assess the influence of intron 1 sequences on the −549CalpLuc reporter, the 1.7-kilobase intron from our original CALP-5 λ clone (26.Miano J.M. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7095-7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) was ligated into a uniqueSalI site located just 3′ of the polyadenylation signal to create −549CalpLuc-I. To assess the transcriptional activity of SM-Calp intron 1 sequences in a heterologous promoter context, we cloned the intron into the SalI site of the pGL3 promoter construct to create SV40Luc-I; this reporter plasmid contains the luciferase gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter (Promega). To address the functional activity of intronic CArG boxes (ICs), we performed site-directed mutagenesis with a high fidelity PfuDNA polymerase (QuikChange, Stratagene). Methylation interference assays and x-ray crystallography have defined critical SRF contact points at guanine residues within the major groove of the CArG box (14.Treisman R. Cell. 1986; 46: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar,34.Pellegrini L. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we mutated the proximal CC(A/T) sequence of each intronic CArG box to GTC (see Fig. 4) to generate −549CalpLuc-mut-IC1, −549CalpLuc-mut-IC2, −549CalpLuc-mut-IC3, and −549CalpLuc-mut-IC1–3. A minimum of three independent mutant plasmids was tested in transient transfections. The presence of mutations and sequence fidelity were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Cells were seeded (25,000 cells/cm2) in 24-well dishes (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) and allowed to attach and grow overnight. The following day, the cells (∼60–70% confluent) were refed fresh complete medium at least 1 h prior to the addition of DNA. Complexes of the reporter gene (1 μg/well) and an internal control plasmid (50 ng/well of pRL-tkRenilla, Promega) were coprecipitated with calcium phosphate and applied to cells essentially as described (35.Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6492) Google Scholar). Approximately 60 h post-transfection, cells were harvested with a mild detergent (Passive Lysis Buffer, Promega), and both firefly andRenilla luciferase activities were analyzed with a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using an AutoLumat LB 953 luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Gaithersburg, MD). In some experiments, we assayed reporter gene expression in the presence of varying amounts (10 ng to 1 μg/well) of either wild-type SRF linked to the herpes simplex virus virion protein, VP16 (SRF-VP16), or a dominant-negative form of SRF (SRFpm1 (36.Prywes R. Zhu H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); kindly provided by Dr. Robert J. Schwartz (Baylor College of Medicine) and Dr. Warren Zimmer (University of South Alabama)). Control cells received equivalent amounts of backbone plasmid without either SRF insert. Because the SRF-VP16 expression plasmid influenced our pRL-tk Renilla reporter (data not shown), data pertaining to SRF-VP16 were normalized to a promoterlessRenilla plasmid (pRL-null Renilla, Promega) as described (37.Behre G. Smith L.T. Tenen D.G. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 24-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All transfections were performed in quadruplicate and repeated in at least one additional experiment per independent plasmid construct. Nuclear extracts from cells grown in 150-mm plates (total of ∼2 × 108 cells) were prepared according to established methods (38.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9159) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) following the manufacturer's specifications. All extracts were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. A plasmid containing the full-length sequence of human SRF (15.Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) was used in anin vitro transcription/translation reaction (TnT system, Promega) to generate recombinant SRF protein. Samples of in vitro translated SRF were stored at −80 °C. High performance liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides were purchased commercially (Operon Technologies, Inc., Alameda, CA) and dissolved in sterile water. Sense (shown in boldface in Fig.4) and antisense oligonucleotides encompassing each of the ICs (underlined and boldface in Fig. 4) or their mutant counterparts (mutant bases are shown in boldface italics below the 5′-nucleotides of each IC in Fig. 4) were individually labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). Each pair of labeled oligonucleotide probes was then mixed, heated to 65 °C for 5 min, and then slowly cooled at room temperature to facilitate annealing. Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were purified on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel; excised; and eluted at 50 °C for 4 h in 0.5m sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. Probes were then centrifuged briefly to pellet the small pieces of acrylamide. The supernatant was passed over a filter column (Whatman) and precipitated at −80 °C with 1 μl of glycogen (20 mg/ml) and 4 volumes of 100% ethanol. The purified probes were then centrifuged, washed with 70% ethanol, recentrifuged, and resuspended in 100 μl of Tris/EDTA (pH 8.0). For EMSAs, ∼5 μg of nuclear extract or 1 μl of in vitro translated SRF was incubated for 10 min on ice in 1× binding buffer (40 mm KCl, 0.4 mmMgCl2, 4% glycerol, 5 mm HEPES, and 2.4 mm EDTA), 16 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.125 μg of poly(dI-dC), 2 mm spermidine, and 0.2 mmdithiothreitol in the absence or presence of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (>100×). Approximately 50,000 cpm of labeled probe (∼0.2–0.5 pm) was then added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. In some samples, 1 μl of antiserum to SRF (sc-335, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), transcription factor YY1 (sc-281, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or SM-Calp (clone hCP; Sigma) was included following probe addition, and the mixture incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature. A second antibody to SRF (raised against the NH2 terminus) was used to further confirm the identity of nucleoprotein complexes. Samples were resolved on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) that pre-ran for 30 min at 150 V prior to loading. Gels were vacuum-dried and then exposed to x-ray film for varying periods of time at −80 °C. A nuclear lacZ reporter gene (kindly provided by Dr. Yassemi Capetanaki, Baylor College of Medicine) or the SRFpm1 dominant-negative mutant (DNSRF) cDNA was cloned into the pCA3 shuttle plasmid (Microbix Biosystems, Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Each transgene was placed under the control of the mouse SM22 promoter (−445 nucleotides), which was cloned into a BglII site of pCA3 in place of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Recombinant shuttle plasmids were integrated into a serotype 5 replication-defective adenovirus (strain dl327) by direct ligation or homologous recombination in human embryonic kidney 293 cells as described (39.Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Crude viral lysates were analyzed for proper integration of the shuttle plasmid by restriction digestion and PCR analysis of the transgene. High titer viral stocks were prepared in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and purified as described (39.Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For viral transductions, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and allowed to grow until ∼80–90% confluent, at which time, the cells were washed and incubated with adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10–100 in 0.6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. Cells were gently rocked every 10 min over the 1-h incubation period to facilitate uniform adsorption of virus to the cell monolayer. After 1 h, complete medium was added, and the cells were allowed to grow for periods up to 4 days post-transduction. Cells were then harvested for mRNA and protein expression assays as described below. Total RNA was isolated from cell monolayers by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/acid phenol method (40.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63176) Google Scholar). For reverse transcription-PCR, samples of total RNA (∼5 μg) were subjected to reverse transcription (first strand cDNA synthesis kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and denaturation (94 °C for 3 min), followed by 25 cycles of PCR (1 min each at 94, 55, and 72 °C) with primers specific for either the 5′-end of rat SM-Calp (forward primer, 5′-ATGTCTTCCGCACACTTTAAC-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-TCGATCCACTCTCTCAGCTCC-3′) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and then either blotted for Southern hybridization to an internal oligonucleotide or excised and purified (Qiaquick column, QIAGEN Inc.) for dideoxynucleotide sequencing. RNase protection assays were carried out with radiolabeled riboprobes to SM-Calp, α-tubulin, and 18 S as described (32.Firulli A.B. Han D. Kelly-Roloff L. Koteliansky V.E. Schwartz S.M. Olson E.N. Miano J.M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1998; 34: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was performed with cDNA probes to rat SM22 and smooth muscle α-actin (32.Firulli A.B. Han D. Kelly-Roloff L. Koteliansky V.E. Schwartz S.M. Olson E.N. Miano J.M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1998; 34: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as well as mouse retinoic acid receptor-α (gift from Dr. Pierre Chambon). Cell monolayers were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped in extraction buffer containing 55 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples were sheared through a 23-gauge needle and then boiled for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay. Initially, samples of protein extracts (25–50 μg) were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm sample integrity and equal loading. Parallel samples were then electroblotted to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) and processed for Western blotting as described (26.Miano J.M. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7095-7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The SRF (1:2000) and SM-Calp (1:5000) antisera are described above. As a control, we incubated blots with an antibody to the SH2 adaptor protein Grb-2 (c-7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Specific immunoreactive proteins were revealed on x-ray film with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,). Transfection data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Paired comparisons were made with a ttest. Where more than two groups of data occur, an analysis of variance was performed, followed by Tukey's post-hoc test for intergroup comparisons. All graphical data and statistical analyses were generated with GraphPAD Prism software (Version 2.0). Data were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. SM-Calp expression is highly restricted to SMC lineages (Fig. 1) (26.Miano J.M. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7095-7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); however, 5′-promoter sequences do not direct SMC-specific activation of a luciferase reporter gene (26.Miano J.M. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7095-7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To determine the role of 3′-sequences in the activity of the SM-Calp promoter, we cloned the entire first intron of SM-Calp downstream of a −549CalpLuc reporter gene. The data depicted in Fig. 2 show that the presence of the first intron results in a 2–3-fold increase in luciferase activity over the −549CalpLuc construct in PAC1 and rat aortic SMCs. A smaller incremental increase in activity was noted in the A7r5 SMC line. Cloning the intron in the opposite orientation resulted in essentially the same elevation in luciferase activity.2 In contrast to the enhancer-like activity contributed by the first intron of SM-Calp in SMCs, every non-SMC line tested showed reduced luciferase activity (Fig. 2). Comparable cell-specific activation of the SM-Calp promoter was observed when the first intron was studied in its proper sequence context (i.e. the first intron follows exon 1 of SM-Calp).2 The data in Fig. 3document SMC-specific enhancer activity conferred by the first intron of SM-Calp in a heterologous promoter context. Taken together, these results suggest that the first intron of SM-Calp contains a SMC-specific enhancer(s) as well as repressive sequences that mitigate the activity of the SM-Calp promoter in non-SMC lineages. Because PAC1 SMCs consistently yielded the highest enhancer activity, we restricted subsequent studies to this SMC line.Figure 2Effect of intron 1 sequences on SM-Calp promoter activity in cultured cells. Cells were transfected with either the −549CalpLuc reporter (black bars) or the same reporter containing the entire first intron of SM-Calp (hatched bars). A Renilla reporter plasmid was cotransfected to correct for varying transfection efficiencies. Normalized luciferase data are shown as -fold changes from the −549CalpLuc reporter (set to 1). Each column of data represents the mean ± S.E. from at least eight samples derived from two independent studies. A two-tailed pairedt test revealed significant differences between −549CalpLuc and −549CalpLuc-I for every cell line (p < 0.05).RASMC, rat aortic SMCs; RLU, relative light units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Effect of SM-Calp intron 1 sequences on a heterologous promoter construct. The first intron of SM-Calp was cloned downstream of an SV40 early promoter-driven luciferase reporter and cotransfected with a Renilla plasmid into PAC1 or L6 cells. The same SMC-specific enhancer activity documented in Fig. 2 is shown in this heterologous promoter context. A two-tailed pairedt test revealed significant differences between SV40Luc and SV40Luc-I in both PAC1 and L6 cells (p < 0.01). Similar results were seen in an independent experiment with the first intron cloned in the opposite orientation (see Footnote 2).RLU, relative light units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 4 shows the nucleotide sequence of the first intron of SM-Calp. A consensus CArG box is present +852 nucleotides from the transcription start site (IC1 in Fig. 4). In addition to the consensus CArG box, two CArG-like elements (IC2 and IC3 in Fig. 4) are present at the 3′-end of the first intron (+1530 and +1745 nucleotides downstream from the transcription start site ). To determine whether SRF binds the individual CArG elements within the first intron of SM-Calp, we performed EMSA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data in Fig.5 A show that recombinant SRF binds the consensus IC1 element. A nucleoprotein complex of comparable mobility was observed with nuclear extracts from the PAC1 SMC line (Fig. 5 A) as well as from several non-SMC lines that do not express SM-Calp (Fig. 5 B). The data presented in Fig. 6 show comparatively weak binding of SRF to IC2 and IC3. Densitometric analysis indicated that the binding of SRF to IC1 was >200 times greater than that observed with IC2 and IC3.2 Indeed, unlabeled IC1oligonucleotide was a more effe"
https://openalex.org/W2106749014,"In addition to the intracellular sorting of lysosomal enzymes, the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGF2R) plays a critical role in regulating the bioavailability of extracellular proteolytic enzymes and growth factors. It has also been shown to be mutated in a number of human cancers, and to suppress cancer cell growth. The purpose of this study was to determine if the M6P/IGF2R is mutated in lung cancer, a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Archival pathology specimens were obtained on 22 patients with newly diagnosed, untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Two polymorphisms in the 3'-untranslated region of the M6P/IGF2R were used to screen lung tumors for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) by PCR amplification of DNA. Nineteen of 22 (86%) patients were informative (heterozygous), and 11/19 (58%) squamous cell carcinomas of the lung had LOH at the M6P/IGF2R locus. The remaining allele in 6/11 (55%) LOH patients contained mutations in either the mannose 6-phosphate or the IGF2 binding domain of the M6P/IGF2R. Thus, the M6P/IGF2R is mutated frequently in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, providing further support for its function as a tumor suppressor."

An estimated 300–500 million cases of malaria each year result in about one million deaths, mainly children under 5 years of age in Africa (1.Anonymous Tropical Disease Research, Thirteenth Programme Report, UNDP/World Bank/World Health Organization Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases. World Health Organization, Geneva1997: 40-73Google Scholar). Malaria is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium; of which four species (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale) infect humans. Other species such as P. knowlesi, P. yoelii, P. berghei,P. chabaudi, and P. gallinaceum, infect a number of wild and domestic animals and are frequently used as models for the human parasites. It is usually claimed that mammalian malaria parasites do not have a functional citric acid cycle (2.Sherman I.W. Sherman I.W. Malaria, Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis and Protection. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1998: 135-143Google Scholar). They are also proposed to lack a mitochondrial ATP synthase and a rotenone-sensitive Complex I (3.Vaidya A.B. Sherman I.W. Malaria, Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis and Protection. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1998: 355-368Google Scholar). Because malaria parasites entirely depend on de novopyrimidine synthesis, a major function of their mitochondrial electron transport chain was proposed as providing a means to dispose electrons generated by dihydroorotate (4.Gutteridge W.E. Dave D. Richards W.H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 582: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The generation of a proton-motive force necessary for other mitochondrial metabolic reactions was also suggested as an important role for their respiratory chain (3.Vaidya A.B. Sherman I.W. Malaria, Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis and Protection. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1998: 355-368Google Scholar). There is conflicting evidence (5.Fry M. Beesley J.E. Parasitology. 1991; 102: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6.Murphy A.D. Doeller J.E. Hearn B. Lang-Unnasch N. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for the presence of a branched electron transport system involving an alternative oxidase in malaria parasites by which electrons are transferred from ubiquinol to oxygen without involving cytochrome c (3.Vaidya A.B. Sherman I.W. Malaria, Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis and Protection. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1998: 355-368Google Scholar). Although mitochondria from P. yoelii and P. falciparum have been isolated, the process of oxidative phosphorylation or their ability to maintain a membrane potential (ΔΨ) could not be demonstrated (5.Fry M. Beesley J.E. Parasitology. 1991; 102: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 7.Fry M. Coombs G.H. North M.J. Biochemical Protozoology. Taylor & Francis, London1991: 154-167Google Scholar). A flow cytometry assay has recently been developed to monitor the mitochondrial membrane potential of P. yoelii inside erythrocytes and the changes induced by atovaquone (8.Srivastava I.K. Rottenberg H. Vaidya A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3961-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). It was concluded that malarial mitochondria do not contribute much to the ATP pool and that these parasites lack the machinery for oxidative phosphorylation (8.Srivastava I.K. Rottenberg H.

This lack of information on mitochondrial physiology inPlasmodium sp. is in contrast to the relevance of mitochondrial activity for the chemotherapy of malaria (8.Srivastava I.K. Rottenberg H.

Our results demonstrate that Complex I, oxidative phosphorylation, and Ca2+ transport occur in P. berghei mitochondria, and evidence is presented for the possible presence of an uncoupling protein in these mitochondria. Plasmodium berghei berghei (strain NK65) was maintained in vivo in male Balb/c mice by weekly transfer infection. Blood was collected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing 10 units of heparin/ml at approximately 60% parasitemia. Red blood cells were washed twice in PBS by centrifugation at 4 °C at 1,500 × g for 5 min. Washed erythrocytes were diluted 1:2 in PBS and passed over a powdered cellulose column (CF11; Whatman, Clifton, BJ) to remove leukocytes and platelets (18.Homewood C.A. Neame K.D. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1976; 70: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Contamination of the resulting preparations with white blood cells was always less than 5% as determined by using a Neubauer chamber and Giemsa staining. Red blood cells depleted of leukocytes and platelets were washed once as described above and resuspended in PBS. Infected erythrocytes were enriched using the Percoll method (19.Dluzewski A.R. Ling I.T. Rangachari K. Bates P.A. Wilson R.J.M. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1984; 78: 622-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Infected erythrocytes within the 70% Percoll interphase were collected and contained predominantly trophozoites (85–90% of the red blood cells, the rest containing ring stage and schizont forms), which were found by examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears. To isolate the parasites, infected erythrocytes were lysed with 0.1 mg/ml saponin in PBS at room temperature for 5 min. After centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove red blood cell membranes, the parasites were washed five times in buffer A (116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mmMgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 50 mmHepes, pH 7.2). The parasites were resuspended at 1 × 108 cells/ml in the same buffer. Contamination of the preparation with red blood cells was negligible. Contamination with white blood cells (mostly lymphocytes) was always less than 1% as determined using a Neubauer chamber and Giemsa staining (typically we obtained about 1.2–1.3 × 109 trophozoites contaminated with 1.0–1.15 × 107 white blood cells per mouse). Control experiments were also done with preparations of white blood cells from control mice in amounts similar to those that could contaminate trophozoite preparations. Those numbers of white blood cells were insufficient to detect the changes in respiration, Ca2+ transport, or mitochondrial membrane potential observed in the experiments with trophozoites (see “Results”). The protein concentration was determined by the biuret assay (20.Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.2% deoxycholate. P. falciparum was obtained as described previously (21.Luo S. Marchesini N. Moreno S.N.J.

The calibrations were made in potassium-free medium containing 0.5% BSA, 200 mmsucrose, 10 mm Na-Hepes buffer (pH 7.2), 5 mmMgCl2, 2.0 mm sodium phosphate, and 0.5 mm EGTA. Absorption spectra and time-dependent absorption changes of safranine O were recorded with an SLM Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer. Representative traces from experiments conducted on at least three separate cell preparations are shown in the figures. Variations in free Ca2+ concentrations were followed by measuring the changes in the absorbance spectrum of Arsenazo III (22.Scarpa A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 301-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), using the SLM Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer at the wavelength pair 675–685 at 28 °C. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and the figures shown are from representative experiments. Concentrations of the ionic species and complexes at equilibrium were calculated by employing an iterative computer program (23.Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) modified from that described by Fabiato and Fabiato (24.Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar) and taking into account the dissociation constants reported by Schwarzenbach et al.(25.Schwarzenbach G. Sen H. Anderegg G. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1975; 40: 1886-1900Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). P. berghei and P. falciparum trophozoites (1 × 109) were resuspended in 100 μl of Dulbecco's PBS. Aliquots (10 μl, about 30 μg of protein) were mixed with 10 μl of electrophoresis buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 10% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4.0% (w/v) SDS, 4.0% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min prior to application to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. White potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum) were obtained from a local supermarket, and crude mitochondria were prepared as described before (26.Beavis A.D. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3079-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). White blood cells from normal mice were obtained using the same procedure used for the preparation of P. berghei trophozoites. Aliquots of crude potato mitochondria (about 30 μg of protein) and an amount of white blood cells similar to the amount that could be present in P. berghei preparations were mixed with electrophoresis buffer and treated as described above. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (27.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus. Blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS and kept overnight at 4 °C. Polyclonal antisera raised against PUMP protein from potato generously supplied by Drs. I. Maia and P. Arruda (Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, Brazil) were used. A 1:1,000 dilution of antiserum in blocking buffer was applied to blots at 25 °C for 60 min. The nitrocellulose was washed three times for 15 min each with T-PBS buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) before addition of a 1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG in blocking buffer for 30 min. Immunoblots were visualized on radiographic film (Kodak) using the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The use of digitonin to permeabilize P. berghei plasma membrane enabled us to study oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondriain situ. Fig. 1 (Aand B) shows that addition of a low concentration of digitonin (16 μm) to suspensions of P. bergheitrophozoites (0.6 mg/ml) incubated in the standard buffer containing 5 mm succinate was followed by a small increase in the rate of oxygen uptake. This increase indicated that the plasma membrane became permeable to succinate. The subsequent addition of ADP induced the transition from resting (State 4) to phosphorylating (State 3) respiration. A respiratory control (State 3/State 4) of 1.9 (TableI) was estimated using the value of State 4 respiration after addition of oligomycin (for nomenclature of respiratory States see Ref. 28.Chance B. Williams G.R. Adv. Enzymol. 1956; 17: 65-134PubMed Google Scholar). FCCP addition, at the concentration used (1 μm), partially released the State 4 respiration, which was then completely inhibited by antimycin A (Fig. 1 A) or potassium cyanide (Fig. 1 B). The inclusion of the respiratory substrate system TMPD/ascorbate, which reduces the respiratory Complex IV, reinitiated respiration that was fully inhibited by 2 mm cyanide (Fig. 1 A), which also occurred in the absence of TMPD/ascorbate (Fig. 1 B). Fig.2 shows that addition of the alternative oxidase inhibitors salicylhydroxamate (SHAM, 2 mm) or benzohydroxamate (BHAM, 1 mm, not shown) after (Fig.2 A) or before 1.5 mm cyanide (Fig.2 B) did not affect respiration, which was completely blocked by KCN (Fig 2, A and B) or antimycin A (Fig.2 C). These results rule out the presence, as previously postulated in P. falciparum (6.Murphy A.D. Doeller J.E. Hearn B. Lang-Unnasch N. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), of a cyanide-insensitive terminal oxidase in P. berghei trophozoites. The operation of a phosphorylating site III is suggested by the results shown in Fig.1 C. Addition of ADP to the antimycin A-poisoned preparation after TMPD/ascorbate (in the absence of succinate) stimulated respiration. The trace WBC in Fig. 1 D shows results from an experiment performed to rule out any influence of white blood cell contamination in the results reported. This preparation of white blood cells (99% lymphocytes) was obtained from normal mice using exactly the same procedure used for the preparation of P. berghei trophozoites. Oxygen uptake was very low and addition of either ADP or oligomycin did not significantly affect this activity. The amount of white blood cells used (1 × 106cells/ml) was the same as the amount that was present in the trophozoite preparation shown in Fig. 1 D, trace Pb.Figure 2Effect of inhibitors on the oxygen consumption by permeabilized trophozoites. The conditions were the same as described in A, with the addition of 16 μm digitonin and 1 μm FCCP. Additions were: trophozoites (Pb, 0.6 mg of protein), potassium cyanide (KCN, 1.5 mm), salicylhydroxamate (SHAM, 2 mm), and antimycin A (AA, 0.5 μg). The number in parentheses indicates the rate of oxygen uptake in nanomoles/min × mg of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Citrate, glutamate, α-ketoglutarate, and malate, substrates commonly used to demonstrate the presence of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I) activity in mitochondrial preparations, were also able to stimulate ADP phosphorylation in permeabilized trophozoites (Table I). Other potential NADH-dependent substrates, such as pyruvate or NADH (Table I), were unable to stimulate respiration or ADP phosphorylation. In contrast, the potential flavoprotein-linked substrates α-glycerophosphate and dihydroorotate (4.Gutteridge W.E. Dave D. Richards W.H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 582: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Table I) were able to stimulate phosphorylation. Mitochondrial membrane potential is probably the most sensitive indicator of the energy-coupling condition of the organelle. The experiment depicted in Fig. 3 Ashows that the mitochondrial membrane potential of digitonin-treated trophozoites could also be accurately estimated using safranine O. In this experiment, the cells were treated with digitonin and the reaction was initiated by the addition of succinate. A fast upward deflection of the trace was observed. Addition of ADP, after the absorbance had stabilized, was followed by a small downward deflection compatible with the utilization of the electrochemical proton potential to drive ADP phosphorylation by the FoF1-ATP synthase (29.Akerman K.E.O. Wikstrom K.F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). As expected, this absorbance decrease was totally reversed by oligomycin, a known inhibitor of the FoF1-ATP synthase. The inclusion of either FCCP (Fig. 3 A) or antimycin A (see below) promoted a fast downward deflection of the trace compatible with depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane and return of safranine to the water phase. The magnitude of the membrane potential of mitochondria respiring on succinate was about 140 mV on the basis of the extent of the safranine shift and comparison to calibrations such as that of Fig. 3 (B and C). In this experiment the permeabilized cells were suspended in a potassium-free medium and the addition of valinomycin did not cause any change in absorbance, but the subsequent titration with potassium was followed by the concomitant decrease in membrane potential due to the electrogenic influx of the cation (30.Mitchell P. Chemiosmotic Coupling in Oxidative and Photosynthetic Phosphorylation. Glynn Research Ltd., Bodmin, United Kingdom1966Crossref Google Scholar). Further addition of FCCP completely collapsed ΔΨ. The membrane potential after each K+ addition was calculated according to the Nernst equation (29.Akerman K.E.O. Wikstrom K.F. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). A mitochondrial membrane potential of similar value to that obtained with succinate (Figs. 3 A and 4 B, trace Pb) could also be generated by the addition of malate/glutamate (Fig. 4 A, trace Pb) or TMPD/ascorbate (Fig. 4 C, trace Pb). Addition of cyanide totally collapsed ΔΨ (Fig. 4 C, trace Pb). Rotenone (1–2 μm) was also effective in collapsing ΔΨ when malate/glutamate was used as the substrate (Fig.4 A, trace Pb). Traces WBCin Fig. 4 show the membrane potential of digitonin-permeabilized white blood cells under similar conditions. The amount of white blood cells used (1 × 106 cells/ml) was the same as the amount that was present in the trophozoite preparation shown in Fig. 4,traces Pb. Addition of Ca2+ to digitonin-permeabilized trophozoites evoked a cycle of respiratory stimulation (Fig.5 A). The higher rate of State 4 respiration in Fig. 5 A, as compared with Fig. 1(A and B) is due to the absence of EGTA in the buffer used. Fig. 5 A shows that successive Ca2+additions resulted in Ca2+ uptake. Addition of EGTA decreased State 4 respiration. Fig. 5 B shows that the addition of Ca2+ caused a decrease in the membrane potential of these mitochondria in situ that was compatible with the electrophoretic influx of Ca2+ into the mitochondria and in agreement with previous results (Fig.5 A). This decrease in ΔΨ was completely reversed when the medium-free Ca2+ was lowered to <10−8m by the addition of excess EGTA. When succinate was added to a reaction medium containing trophozoites, 3.5 μm free Ca2+, and digitonin, a rapid decrease in Ca2+ concentration started and continued until a steady state was attained at a free Ca2+ concentration of about 0.6 μm (Fig. 5 C). The subsequent addition of FCCP was followed by a large increase in medium Ca2+, indicating the existence of an important mitochondrial Ca2+-transporting activity. Subsequent addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 resulted in the additional release of Ca2+ from an extramitochondrial Ca2+ pool. When the order of additions was reversed, FCCP did not cause further Ca2+ release. We noticed that addition of 0.5% BSA was necessary to obtain better coupled mitochondria of trophozoites in situ. Uncoupling of mitochondria is usually considered an unwanted pathological effect or an isolation artifact. Because parasitized erythrocytes, as well as malaria parasites, are known to contain large amounts of free fatty acids (31.Wallace W.R. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1966; 15: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 32.Holz G.G. Beach D.H. Sherman I.W. J. Protozool. 1977; 24: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 33.Beach D.H.

O. 1977; 55: 237-248PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of BSA, which removes fatty acids, can be interpreted as prevention of free fatty acid-induced uncoupling. However, regulated uncoupling mediated by uncoupling proteins or other carriers (35.Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) could also play an important role in several mitochondria where a sudden or transient cutoff of efficient ATP production is required (35.Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that linoleic acid exerted an uncoupling effect on trophozoite mitochondria in situ as manifested by the increase in the resting state respiration with succinate as substrate. Addition of BSA (Fig.6 C), which removes free fatty acids, reversed this effect, which was further weakly reversed by addition of GTP, a known inhibitor of the uncoupling protein (thermogenin) of brown adipose tissue (35.Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Subsequent FCCP addition stimulated oxygen consumption. BSA and GTP were ineffective when added after FCCP instead of linoleic acid (data not shown). Fig. 6 also shows that these mitochondria were more tightly coupled, as indicated by the lower resting state respiration, when suspended in media containing BSA and GTP (Fig. 6 A, State 4 respiration: 6.4 nmol of O2/min/mg of protein; respiratory control ratio: 2.4) than in medium without these compounds (Fig.6 B, State 4 respiration: 9.8 nmol of O2/min/mg of protein, respiratory control ratio: 1.6). Addition of linoleic acid also decreased the membrane potential of these mitochondria (Fig.7 A), and this effect was partially reversed by BSA (Fig. 7 A), GTP (Fig.7 B), or ATP (Fig. 7 A). The lack of complete reversal by BSA, especially when incubations were done in the absence of EGTA (Fig. 7, A and B) or for prolonged time (Fig. 8), could also indicate some additional nonspecific effects of the fatty acids. Fig. 7 Cshows that addition of GTP produced an increase in the value of the membrane potential, which was further increased by bovine serum albumin. Similar results were obtained when the order of additions was reversed (Fig. 7, D and E). Fig. 7 Eshows that 2,4-dinitrophenol was also able to partially collapse ΔΨ, which was then completely collapsed by antimycin A. Uncoupling by free fatty acids, at least in animal mitochondria, is mediated not only by uncoupling proteins but also by other carriers such as the ATP/ADP antiporter (36.Andreyev A.Y. Bodareva T.O.

https://openalex.org/W2097800928,"Several guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the Rho family of GTPases that induce activation by exchanging GDP for GTP have been identified. One of these is the tumor invasion gene product Tiam1, which acts on Rac1. In this study, we demonstrate that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and lysophosphatidic acid induce the translocation of Tiam1 to the membrane fraction of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in a time-dependent manner. Previously, we have shown that Tiam1 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium/calmodulin kinase II (CaMK II) after stimulation with agonists. Here we show, by pretreatment of cells with kinase inhibitors, that CaMK II, but not PKC, is involved in the membrane translocation of Tiam1. Addition of the calcium ionophore ionomycin alone induced the translocation of Tiam1. However, the cell-permeable diacylglycerol oleoylacetylglycerol was without effect and did not enhance the effect of ionomycin. These data further indicated a role for CaMK II and not PKC. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase by wortmannin had little effect on the translocation of Tiam1. The role of phosphorylation was further studied by comparing the phosphorylation pattern of Tiam1 in the membranes versus whole cell Tiam1. PDGF-induced phosphorylation of membrane-associated Tiam1 occurred more rapidly than that of the total Tiam1 pool, and CaMK II, but not PKC, played a significant role in this process. Furthermore, by using the p21-binding domain of PAK-3, we show that PDGF, but not lysophosphatidic acid, activates Rac1 in vivo and that this activation involves CaMK II and PKC, but not 3-phosphoinositides. Our results indicate that Tiam1 is translocated to and phosphorylated at membranes after agonist stimulation and that CaMK II, but not PKC, is involved in this process. Also, these kinases are involved in the activation of Rac in vivo.

Better characterized members are RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42. These proteins mediate the actions of various extracellular agonists to elicit different forms of cytoskeletal reorganization and other cellular responses. Agonists such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA),1which stimulate heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors, induce stress fiber and focal contact formation through the activation of Rho-mediated pathways. Receptors with tyrosine kinase activity that are activated by growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or insulin stimulate the generation of lamellipodia (membrane ruffles) through the activation of Rac-mediated pathways. Other agonists like bradykinin induce the Cdc42-mediated formation of filopodia (1.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 2.Hall A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Rho family GTPases are regulated by the binding of guanine nucleotides. They are inactive when bound to GDP and active when bound to GTP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) exchange GDP for GTP, thus rendering the G proteins active (4.Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). GTPase-activating proteins increase the intrinsic GTPase activity of the G proteins, which switches them to an inactive state following the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP (5.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The Rho family GEFs are characterized by Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains in their sequences. The Dbl homology domain is proposed to be responsible for the GEF activity, whereas the PH domain is a binding site of lipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and/or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) (6.Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Tiam1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 that encodes two PH domains and one Dbl homology domain. It was first characterized by its ability to induce T lymphoma cells to invade monolayers of fibroblasts (7.Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that Tiam1 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium/calmodulin kinase II (CaMK II)in vitro and upon treatment with PDGF or LPA in vivo (8.Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Collard J.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33105-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9.Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the N-terminally truncated form of Tiam1 by CaMK II increases the GEF activity toward Rac in vitro, indicating an important role for CaMK II activity in vivo (10.Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Buchanan F.G. Downes C.P. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12753-12758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast, in vitro phosphorylation of truncated Tiam1 by PKCα has no effect on GEF activity toward Rac1. Recent studies have shown that the generation of PIP3through the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) can increase the amount of GTP bound to Rac after PDGF stimulation (5.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin has also been shown to inhibit the formation of Rac-GTP and also membrane ruffling in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts while not affecting stress fiber formation mediated by Rho (11.Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Wortmannin also blocks Rac2 activation induced byN-formyl-methioninyl-leucyl-phenylalanine in neutrophils (12.Akasaki T. Koga H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18055-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The co-localization of proteins and/or lipids is an important factor in the regulation of signaling cascades. Different agonists induce distinctive reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and induce the translocation of Rho family proteins. For example, the treatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with LPA induces the translocation of Rho, but not Rac, to a membrane fraction including caveolae. Conversely, the treatment of fibroblasts with PDGF induces the translocation of Rac, but not Rho, to the membranes and caveolae (13.Michiels F. Collard J.G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 65: 125-146PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Michaely P.A. Mineo C. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21430-21436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). There have been few reports of the translocation of GEFs in response to agonists. The Ras family GEF SOS has been shown to translocate to membranes upon stimulation with insulin, epidermal growth factor, or macrophage-stimulated protein (15.Langlois W.J. Medh J. Leitner J.W. Sasaoka T. Olefsky J.M. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2412-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16.Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Moreover, the translocation of SOS alone is sufficient to observe activation of Ras (17.Overbeck A.F. Brtva T.R. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Huff S.Y. Khosravi-Far R. Quilliam L.A. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). There is little information on agonist-induced translocation of Rho family GEFs. Tiam1 has been shown to associate with the membrane upon serum stimulation, and membrane association of Tiam1 is required for membrane ruffling (18.Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van S.L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the membrane association of Tiam1 is dependent upon the N-terminal PH domain and an as yet undetermined adjacent protein interaction domain (19.Stam J.C. Sander E.E. Michiels F. Van Leevwen F.N. Kain H.E.T. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28447-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To further define the role of translocation in the activation of small G proteins, we examined if agonists could induced membrane association of Tiam1 and explored what role phosphorylation served in this process. Until recently, the study of the in vivo activation of small G proteins has involved the observation of downstream morphological changes. As stated above, Rac activation leads to membrane ruffling, and Rho activation leads to stress fiber formation. Current research has provided a new assay for the quantitation of the in vivoactivity of the small G proteins. Downstream protein kinases such as the PAK and PRK isoforms have been shown to bind to Rho family GTPases (20.Fujisawa K. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Bito H. Saito Y. Hall A. Narumiya S. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The association occurs when the small G proteins are in an active GTP-bound form, and this association activates the kinase (22.Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar,23.Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

The binding domains of these kinases have been identified and are currently being used to determine the in vivo activity of the G proteins. We utilized the p21-binding domain of PAK-3 (24.Glaven J.A. Whitehead I. Bagrodia S. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2279-2285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) to determine what effects phosphorylation and PI3K activity have on agonist-induced activation of Rac1. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Calf serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Life Technologies, Inc. Lysophosphatidic acid and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) were from Avanti Polar Lipids. Ro-31-8220, KN-93, ionomycin, and BAPTA/AM were from Calbiochem.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Vector Laboratories, Inc. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Millipore Corp. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4 mml-glutamine supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes for 1–2 days to a confluence of 60–70%. The medium was replaced with a reduced serum medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) for 24 h to induce quiescence of the cells. The cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin for 2 h prior to treatment. Quiescent cells were treated with inhibitors and/or agonists at 37 °C for various times as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS and scraped in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μmsodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride). The cells were then disrupted by brief sonication and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer. Protein concentrations for the cytosol and membrane fractions were determined by the BCA method. Quiescent cells were treated with inhibitors and/or agonists at 37 °C for various times as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS and scraped in 500 μl of lysis buffer. The cells were then disrupted by brief sonication and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellets were resuspended in RIPA buffer (PBS containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride) and rocked for 1 h at 4 °C with Tiam1 antibody. Protein A-agarose beads were added, and the lysate was rocked for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with RIPA buffer. The beads were then resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Quiescent cells were treated with inhibitors and/or agonists at 37 °C for various times as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS and scraped in 500 μl of lysis buffer. The cells were then disrupted by brief sonication and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was rocked for 1 h at 4 °C with Tiam1 antibody. Protein A-agarose beads were added, and the lysate was rocked for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with RIPA buffer. The beads were then resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. These experiments were performed essentially as described (24.Glaven J.A. Whitehead I. Bagrodia S. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2279-2285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, quiescent cells were treated with inhibitors and/or agonists at 37 °C for various times as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS and scraped in 500 μl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride. The cells were disrupted by five passes through a 27-gauge needle and rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with 30 μg of the p21-binding domain of PAK-3 linked to glutathioneS-transferase on Sepharose beads (or glutathioneS-transferase-Sepharose alone) at 4 °C. (Prior to incubation with PAK-3, 20 μl of supernatant was removed to determine equal amounts of Rac.) The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with the above buffer. The beads were resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. SDS gel electrophoresis was performed on 6% Tris/glycine-polyacrylamide gels at 100 V for 2.5 h, and the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Novex wet transfer apparatus at 20 V for 90 min. The membranes were blocked overnight in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad). The blots were incubated for 1 h in the presence of primary antibody, rinsed three times in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20, and incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Tiam1 has been shown to associate with the membrane fraction, and mutational studies have indicated that this association is mediated by the N-terminal PH domain, an adjacent coiled-coil region, and a surrounding sequence (18.Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van S.L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar,19.Stam J.C. Sander E.E. Michiels F.

To determine what factors induce this association, we examined if translocation of Tiam1 was induced by two different agonists, PDGF and LPA, in NIH 3T3 cells. Both agonists caused translocation of Tiam1 to the membrane fraction in a time-dependent manner (Fig.1). The increase in Tiam1 at the membrane induced by PDGF was apparent in 1 min and was increasingly sustained through 30 min. Membrane fractions were also blotted with β1 integrin to show equal loading. Tiam1 translocation was detectable with 5 ng/ml PDGF and maximal with 50 ng/ml (data not shown). The amount of Tiam1 in the cytosol steadily declined and was absent at the 30-min time point, thus mirroring the increase in the membrane. LPA also induced a similar time course of translocation, except that membrane association of Tiam1 returned to basal levels by 30 min (Fig. 1). In general, the effect was smaller and less sustained than that of PDGF and was induced by LPA concentrations as low as 25 μm. As seen with the PDGF-induced translocation, the level of Tiam1 in the cytosol upon LPA stimulation correlated with the level of Tiam1 in the membrane. The cytosolic level of Tiam1 decreased as the membrane level increased through 10 min of stimulation. Furthermore, at 30 min, the loss of Tiam1 in the membrane fraction was mirrored by an increase in the cytosol. These two distinct time courses illustrate the different effects of PDGF and LPA on the translocation of Tiam1. Previously, we showed that two protein kinases, PKC and CaMK II, phosphorylate Tiam1 in vivo andin vitro (8.Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Collard J.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33105-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9.Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To determine if these kinases play a role in the translocation of Tiam1, we used inhibitors to block their activity and then observed the translocation induced by PDGF or LPA. The staurosporine analog Ro-31-8220 has been shown to inhibit the kinase activity of PKC (25.Davis P.D. Elliott L.H. Harris W. Hill C.H. Hurst S.A. Keech E. Kumar M.K. Lawton G. Nixon J.S. Wilkinson S.E. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and KN-93 has been shown to inhibit CaMK II activity (26.Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs. 2 and3, Ro-31-8220 had no consistent effect on the translocation of Tiam1 to the membrane induced by either PDGF or LPA. However, in the presence of the inhibitor KN-93, the PDGF- or LPA-induced translocation of Tiam1 was greatly reduced (Figs. 2 and3). 2The cells were treated with KN-93 for 24 h to be consistent with our earlier study (10.Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Buchanan F.G. Downes C.P. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12753-12758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, an inhibitory effect of KN-93 could be observed after 2 h of treatment. These data indicate that the kinase activity of CaMK II, but not that of PKC, is involved in the translocation of Tiam1. Previously, we observed that the inhibition of PKC or CaMK II alone reduced the phosphorylation of Tiam1 on threonine and that inhibition of both kinases virtually abolished all threonine phosphorylation of Tiam1 (10.Fleming I.N.

Therefore, we tested if inhibition of both kinases could completely inhibit membrane translocation of Tiam1. However, the combination of inhibitors had no greater effect than that of KN-93 alone (Figs. 2 and 3), indicating again that CaMK II activity, but not PKC activity, is involved in the translocation of Tiam1.Figure 3Effect of PKC and CaMK II inhibitors on LPA-induced translocation of Tiam1. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were preincubated with vehicle (Me2SO; −), 5 μmRo-31-8220 (Ro; +) for 60 min, 20 μm KN-93 (+) for 24 h, or 1 μm wortmannin (Wort; +) for 15 min. Cells were then treated with 100 μm LPA for the indicated times. Cells were lysed, and the cytosol and membrane fractions were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of Tiam1 at the membrane was determined by Western blotting with Tiam1 antibody.

Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Since PDGF treatment stimulates PI3K activity (29.Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Schaffhausen B. Pallas D.C. White M. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), we sought to determine if inhibition of PIP3 generation would affect the translocation of Tiam1. Cells were pretreated with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin and then stimulated with PDGF or LPA. In the presence of wortmannin, we observed a small, but reproducible decrease in the translocation of Tiam1 induced by PDGF (Fig. 2). However, no consistent effect of the inhibitor was observed on the smaller translocation induced by LPA (Fig. 3). These data indicate that the generation of PIP3 plays a lesser role in the translocation of Tiam1 induced by PDGF than does CaMK II activity. Membrane samples from Figs. 2 and 3 were blotted with β1integrin to show equal loading, and cytosolic blots of Tiam1 complemented those of the membrane fractions, as shown in Fig. 1 (data not shown). To further investigate the role of phosphorylation in the translocation of Tiam1 to the membrane, we sought to determine if a rise in Ca2+ could stimulate translocation. The calcium ionophore ionomycin has been shown to increase intracellular Ca2+ levels (30.Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This increase in Ca2+ can serve to activate CaMK II and can also participate with diacylglycerol in the activation of classical isozymes of PKC. Therefore, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were treated with ionomycin and/or OAG, a water-soluble form of diacylglycerol, to determine if they affected membrane translocation of Tiam1. As shown in Fig.4, treatment with ionomycin resulted in a substantial increase in Tiam1 in the membrane fraction, suggesting that activation of CaMK II alone can translocate Tiam1. In contrast, treatment with OAG did not induce translocation of Tiam1 and did not alter the effect of ionomycin. As noted in Figs. 2 and 3, membrane fractions were blotted with β1 integrin to verify equal protein loading, and changes in cytosolic Tiam1 reflected those in the membrane fractions (data not shown). These data support the conclusion that activation of CaMK II, but not PKC, is able to translocate Tiam1 to the membrane fraction. To further explore the role of phosphorylation in the translocation of Tiam1, we compared the phosphorylation patterns of Tiam1 in whole cells versusthat in the membrane fraction in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts treated with agonists. The cells were either lysed in RIPA buffer or fractionated in a non-detergent buffer. Tiam1 was then immunoprecipitated from whole cells or the membrane fraction, and Western blotting was performed with phosphothreonine antibodies. In whole cells, PDGF induced phosphorylation of Tiam1, which reached a maximum at 10 min (Fig.5, upper). This is consistent with the previously reported time course in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (9.Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, a very different time course of Tiam1 phosphorylation was seen in the membrane fraction. The time course of phosphorylation of membrane-associated Tiam1 was much faster than that of total (cytosol + membrane) Tiam1 (Fig. 5, upper). The phosphorylation of Tiam1 in the membranes was maximal at 1–5 min and nearly disappeared at 30 min, whereas total phosphorylation was maximal at 10 min and still evident at 30 min. These data indicate that Tiam1 is very rapidly phosphorylated in membranes and then becomes dephosphorylated since Tiam1 protein is still present in the membranes at 10 and 30 min (see Fig. 1). On the other hand, total phosphorylation, which mainly represents that in the cytosol, occurs more slowly and correlates with membrane association of Tiam1 (Fig.1). 3We were unable to consistently immunoprecipitate Tiam1 from the cytosol to determine the phosphorylation of Tiam1 in this fraction alone. Interestingly, the LPA-induced phosphorylation of total and membrane pools of Tiam1 showed a more similar time course. As Fig. 5(lower) shows, the phosphorylation of Tiam1 increased by 1 min and was sustained through 30 min in both fractions. There was no delay in total Tiam1 phosphorylation as seen with PDGF. There was a decrease in phosphorylated Tiam1 at 30 min in both total and membrane fractions. The latter corresponded with the loss of Tiam1 from the membranes (Fig. 1). To further define what role phosphorylation plays in the translocation of Tiam1, we pretreated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with Ro-31-8220, KN-93, or wortmannin and then induced the translocation and phosphorylation of Tiam1 with agonists. Addition of the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 had no effect on the phosphorylation of membrane-associated Tiam1 (Fig. 6), just as it had no effect on the translocation of Tiam1 (Fig. 2). Although inhibition of PKC has been shown to reduce total cellular Tiam1 phosphorylation (9.Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the data of Fig. 6 indicate that this primarily involves cytosolic Tiam1. PDGF-induced phosphorylation of membrane Tiam1 was greatly reduced by addition of the CaMK II inhibitor KN-93. However, this is probabl"

Although direct contacts between transactivators and components of the core RNA polymerase II complex provide one method of controlling transcriptional activation, interactions between DNA-bound factors and coregulatory proteins also regulate gene transcription. One example of a corepressor is the retinoblastoma protein, which, by interacting with the E2F transcription factor, converts E2F into a repressor of cell-cycle genes (1.Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N. Luo R.X. Zhang S.H. He S. Dean D.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Members of the nuclear receptor family such as RAR and TR also use coregulatory proteins to achieve both positive and negative effects on transcription (2.Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). These nuclear receptors interact with SRC-CBP-CAF coactivator complexes or with N-CoR-Rpd3 corepressor complexes in the presence or absence of ligand, respectively, resulting in activation or repression of transcription. These complexes may influence transcription through effects on chromatin structure and/or through interactions with the transcriptional initiation machinery (3.Mannervik M. Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M.

As immediate-early genes that are rapidly synthesized following a wide range of extracellular stimuli, EGR proteins transduce extracellular signals into a rapid transcriptional response. Although members of the EGR family are frequently coexpressed and may be functionally redundant, targeted gene disruption of EGR family members has revealed specific roles for individual EGR proteins. Female mice lacking EGR1 display infertility due to reduced transcription of LHβ (7.Lee S.L. Sadovsky Y. Swirnoff A.H. Polish J.A. Goda P. Gavrilina G. Milbrandt J.

These proteins represent a broadly conserved family with homologues in mammals,Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. 1M. Clements and J. Milbrandt, unpublished data.1M. Clements and J. Milbrandt, unpublished data. The mammalian NAB1 and NAB2 proteins possess a conserved N-terminal domain necessary for the interaction with EGR proteins and for NAB self-association (NAB ConservedDomain 1, NCD1) and a conserved C-terminal domain implicated in transcriptional corepression (NCD2). NAB proteins down-regulate the activity of EGR1, EGR2, and EGR3, which contain a conserved domain (R1) that lies N-terminal of the DNA-binding zinc fingers, but do not interact with EGR4, which lacks this domain (15.Russo M.W. Sevetson B.R. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6873-6877Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). NAB repression normally requires the recruitment of NAB-EGR complexes to promoters via EGR-binding sites, but direct tethering of NAB proteins by fusion to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain can repress various Gal4-responsive promoters in the absence of EGR proteins (16.Swirnoff A.H.

In PC12 cells, NAB2 overexpression blocked NGF-dependent differentiation and prevented NGF induction of TGF-β1, MMP-3, and p21WAF1(29.Qu Z. Wolfraim L.A. Svaren J. Ehrengruber M.U. Davidson N. Milbrandt J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recessive mutation in the NAB-binding domain of EGR2 has recently been linked to human myelinopathy, as have dominant mutations in the EGR2 DNA-binding domain (30.Warner L.E. Svaren J. Milbrandt J. Lupski J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1245-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).NAB1 is widely expressed in the adult mouse, whereas NAB2 mRNA expression is highest in brain and thymus (31.Svaren J.

NAB2 is induced as a delayed-early gene by several stimuli that also up-regulate EGR expression, such as serum stimulation of fibroblasts or NGF treatment of PC12 cells. NAB1 induction has also been observed in several systems, including glucocorticoid treatment of a leiomyosarcoma cell line (32.Fan W. Ma J.X. Cheng L. Norris J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1342-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).The infertility phenotype of female EGR1 knockout mice has demonstrated the physiological relevance of EGR1 transactivation at the LHβ promoter. The GnRH-responsive element of the LHβ promoter encompasses two broadly conserved EGR1-binding sites as well as two binding sites for steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), which synergizes with EGR1 to dramatically up-regulate LHβ transcription (33.Halvorson L.M.

LHβ is up-regulated in pituitary gonadotropes following stimulation by the hypothalamic peptide GnRH, and several studies have reported up-regulation of EGR1 in gonadotrope cell lines following GnRH administration (34.Dorn C. Ou Q. Svaren J. Crawford P.A. Sadovsky Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13870-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 35.Wolfe M.W. Call G.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 752-763PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the homeobox transcription factor PTX1 has recently been reported to enhance LHβ transcription through synergistic interactions with SF-1 and EGR1 (36.Tremblay J.J. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2567-2576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study we report a novel ability of NAB proteins to enhance EGR-mediated activation of the LHβ gene. NAB activation was found to require the protein domain (NCD2) previously implicated in NAB repression and was not dependent upon the presence of EGR activation domains or of SF-1-binding sites at the LHβ promoter. Additionally, analysis using chimeric, synthetic, and mutant promoters demonstrated that both the number and relative affinity of EGR-binding sites combine to determine the effect of NAB proteins on transcription.DISCUSSIONThe initial characterization of NAB proteins demonstrated that they repress transactivation by EGR1 of a synthetic promoter bearing four canonical EGR-binding sites. As widely expressed corepressors of EGR-dependent transcription that can be induced by many of the stimuli that up-regulate EGR genes, NAB proteins were predicted to negatively regulate Egr target genes. Here we have reported that NAB proteins can also function as potent coactivators of certain EGR target promoters, including LHβ, perhaps the best established physiological target of EGR1. NAB coactivation was also observed using both various synthetic minimal promoters and the promoter of the Fas ligand gene, a putative Egr2/Egr3 target gene (27.Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 28.Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3222-3227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both NAB1 and NAB2 can function as EGR coactivators, and this coactivation is dependent upon the NAB-EGR interaction. NAB coactivation occurs independently of EGR transactivation domains and SF-1-binding sites, and maps to the NCD2 domain previously implicated in NAB corepression.Comparison of NAB-activated and NAB-repressed EGR-responsive promoters suggested a positive correlation between the observation of NAB repression and the presence of GC-rich sequences in a given promoter. In principle, GC-rich sequences might influence NAB function through an effect on promoter melting requirements for transcriptional initiation or by recruiting the ubiquitously expressed Sp1 transactivator, which binds a GC-rich consensus site (GGCGGG). However, analysis of chimeric, mutant, and synthetic promoters demonstrated that both the nature and the number of a promoter's EGR-binding sites ultimately determine NAB function.An ability to both activate and repress transcriptional activity has previously been reported for a number of proteins, including WT1, YY1, p53, retinoblastoma protein, Dorsal, RORα, various prokaryotic transactivators (49.van der Woude M.W. Kaltenbach L.S. Low D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 50.Ansari A.Z. Bradner J.E. O'Halloran T.V.

WT1, the Wilms tumor suppressor protein, is related to EGR proteins in its DNA-binding domain and binds a similar consensus site (52.Rauscher F.J. Morris J.F. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Its differential effects on transcription have been mapped to independent activation and repression domains that may interact with various cellular proteins (53.Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Gurrieri M. Huang J. Deuel T.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1243-1247PubMed Google Scholar). In several other cases of activator/repressor proteins, such as RORα (54.Harding H.P. Atkins G.B. Jaffe A.B. Seo W.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1737-1746PubMed Google Scholar) and the HIV Tat protein (55.Brown J.A. Howcroft T.K. Singer D.S. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1998; 17: 9-16Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), separate activation and repression domains have also been identified. Concentration-dependent activity switches have been reported for other repressor/activators such as p53, which can activate at low levels and repress at higher levels (56.Kristjuhan A. Maimets T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and BSAP, which at low levels reportedly activates transcription from high affinity binding sites but at higher concentrations represses transcription from low affinity sites (57.Wallin J.J. Gackstetter E.R. Koshland M.E. Science. 1998; 279: 1961-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The activity of Dorsal depends on binding of factors to adjacent DNA sites (58.Ip Y.T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas the corepressor Rb can activate transcription through interactions with factors such as MyoD (59.Sellers W.R. Novitch B.G. Miyake S. Heith A. Otterson G.A. Kaye F.J. Lassar A.B. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). YY1 activates or represses in a complex pattern that may depend both on its intrinsic DNA-bending ability and on interactions with promoter-bound factors (60.Natesan S. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5975-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 61.Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).A bacteriophage activator/repressor protein, p4 from phage φ29, is reminiscent of NAB proteins in the use of a single protein domain to carry out both repression and activation. The interaction between p4 and bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) leads to activation or repression depending on the strength of the sigma A-binding site (62.Monsalve M. Calles B. Mencia M. Salas M. Rojo F. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). At a weak binding site, p4-directed transcription is activated through recruitment and stabilization of RNAP; at a strong binding site, bound RNAP is overstabilized and trapped at the promoter, leading to transcriptional repression. Fig. 10depicts a similar model as applied to NAB activity. According to this hypothetical scheme, the NAB NCD2 domain might interact with the mammalian RNA polymerase complex either directly or through an unidentified bridging factor. At promoters with few or low affinity EGR-binding sites, such an interaction might result in productive recruitment of the transcriptional machinery and NAB coactivation. At promoters with higher affinity and/or greater numbers of EGR-binding sites, cooperative interactions between bound NAB-EGR complexes and the NCD2-interacting factor could result in trapping of the overstabilized polymerase complex, reduced promoter clearance, and NAB repression. Testing of this model would require the identification of NCD2 target(s) and the development of promoter clearance assays in NAB-regulated transcriptional systems.Initial analysis of NAB proteins suggested that their interaction with EGR proteins would transform an EGR transactivator into an EGR-NAB repressor complex. Results described in this study suggest that, at certain promoters such as LHβ, NAB proteins can amplify an EGR-directed transcriptional response. This novel activation function of NAB proteins may help to explain the association of a mutation in the NAB-binding domain of EGR2 (I268N) with a recessive case of human myelinopathy (30.Warner L.E. Svaren J. Milbrandt J. Lupski J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1245-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Myelinopathies result from Schwann cell defects leading to abnormal myelination, and these particular cases are presumably caused by misregulation of one or more EGR2 target genes. If NAB proteins function as repressors of a critical target gene, one might expect a single, derepressed allele of EGR2(I268N) to up-regulate markedly target gene transcription, leading to a dominant inheritance pattern. But if NAB proteins function instead as coactivators of a critical EGR2 target gene, mutation of both EGR2 alleles might be required to decrease significantly EGR-directed transcription, and recessive disease transmission would be predicted. Further elucidation of the role of NAB proteins in human myelinopathies awaits the identification of critical EGR2 target genes within Schwann cells, but the association of a mutation in the NAB-binding domain of EGR2 with human disease highlights the importance of coregulatory proteins such as NAB1 and NAB2 in transcriptional control. Transcriptional control plays a key role in fundamental cellular processes throughout the life of an organism and is regulated by the interactions of DNA-bound transcription factors with other nuclear proteins. Although direct contacts between transactivators and components of the core RNA polymerase II complex provide one method of controlling transcriptional activation, interactions between DNA-bound factors and coregulatory proteins also regulate gene transcription. One example of a corepressor is the retinoblastoma protein, which, by interacting with the E2F transcription factor, converts E2F into a repressor of cell-cycle genes (1.Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N.

Members of the nuclear receptor family such as RAR and TR also use coregulatory proteins to achieve both positive and negative effects on transcription (2.Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). These nuclear receptors interact with SRC-CBP-CAF coactivator complexes or with N-CoR-Rpd3 corepressor complexes in the presence or absence of ligand, respectively, resulting in activation or repression of transcription. These complexes may influence transcription through effects on chromatin structure and/or through interactions with the transcriptional initiation machinery (3.Mannervik M. Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1999; 284: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). EGR proteins are zinc finger transcription factors that have been implicated in the control of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis in the nervous system, the immune system, and elsewhere (4.Gashler A.

As immediate-early genes that are rapidly synthesized following a wide range of extracellular stimuli, EGR proteins transduce extracellular signals into a rapid transcriptional response. Although members of the EGR family are frequently coexpressed and may be functionally redundant, targeted gene disruption of EGR family members has revealed specific roles for individual EGR proteins. Female mice lacking EGR1 display infertility due to reduced transcription of LHβ (7.Lee S.L. Sadovsky Y. Swirnoff A.H. Polish J.A. Goda P. Gavrilina G. Milbrandt J.

These proteins represent a broadly conserved family with homologues in mammals,Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. 1M. Clements and J. Milbrandt, unpublished data.1M. Clements and J. Milbrandt, unpublished data. The mammalian NAB1 and NAB2 proteins possess a conserved N-terminal domain necessary for the interaction with EGR proteins and for NAB self-association (NAB ConservedDomain 1, NCD1) and a conserved C-terminal domain implicated in transcriptional corepression (NCD2). NAB proteins down-regulate the activity of EGR1, EGR2, and EGR3, which contain a conserved domain (R1) that lies N-terminal of the DNA-binding zinc fingers, but do not interact with EGR4, which lacks this domain (15.Russo M.W. Sevetson B.R. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6873-6877Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). NAB repression normally requires the recruitment of NAB-EGR complexes to promoters via EGR-binding sites, but direct tethering of NAB proteins by fusion to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain can repress various Gal4-responsive promoters in the absence of EGR proteins (16.Swirnoff A.H.

NAB proteins could potentially coregulate a wide variety of EGR target genes, including bFGF2 (17.Biesiada E. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol.

In PC12 cells, NAB2 overexpression blocked NGF-dependent differentiation and prevented NGF induction of TGF-β1, MMP-3, and p21WAF1(29.Qu Z. Wolfraim L.A. Svaren J. Ehrengruber M.U. Davidson N. Milbrandt J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recessive mutation in the NAB-binding domain of EGR2 has recently been linked to human myelinopathy, as have dominant mutations in the EGR2 DNA-binding domain (30.Warner L.E. Svaren J. Milbrandt J. Lupski J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1245-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). NAB1 is widely expressed in the adult mouse, whereas NAB2 mRNA expression is highest in brain and thymus (31.Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). NAB2 is induced as a delayed-early gene by several stimuli that also up-regulate EGR expression, such as serum stimulation of fibroblasts or NGF treatment of PC12 cells. NAB1 induction has also been observed in several systems, including glucocorticoid treatment of a leiomyosarcoma cell line (32.Fan W. Ma J.X. Cheng L. Norris J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1342-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The infertility phenotype of female EGR1 knockout mice has demonstrated the physiological relevance of EGR1 transactivation at the LHβ promoter. The GnRH-responsive element of the LHβ promoter encompasses two broadly conserved EGR1-binding sites as well as two binding sites for steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), which synergizes with EGR1 to dramatically up-regulate LHβ transcription (33.Halvorson L.M. Ito M. Jameson J.L. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14712-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 34.Dorn C. Ou Q. Svaren J. Crawford P.A. Sadovsky Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13870-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). LHβ is up-regulated in pituitary gonadotropes following stimulation by the hypothalamic peptide GnRH, and several studies have reported up-regulation of EGR1 in gonadotrope cell lines following GnRH administration (34.Dorn C. Ou Q. Svaren J. Crawford P.A. Sadovsky Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13870-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 35.Wolfe M.W. Call G.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 752-763PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the homeobox transcription factor PTX1 has recently been reported to enhance LHβ transcription through synergistic interactions with SF-1 and EGR1 (36.Tremblay J.J. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2567-2576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we report a novel ability of NAB proteins to enhance EGR-mediated activation of the LHβ gene. NAB activation was found to require the protein domain (NCD2) previously implicated in NAB repression and was not dependent upon the presence of EGR activation domains or of SF-1-binding sites at the LHβ promoter. Additionally, analysis using chimeric, synthetic, and mutant promoters demonstrated that both the number and relative affinity of EGR-binding sites combine to determine the effect of NAB proteins on transcription. DISCUSSIONThe initial characterization of NAB proteins demonstrated that they repress transactivation by EGR1 of a synthetic promoter bearing four canonical EGR-binding sites. As widely expressed corepressors of EGR-dependent transcription that can be induced by many of the stimuli that up-regulate EGR genes, NAB proteins were predicted to negatively regulate Egr target genes. Here we have reported that NAB proteins can also function as potent coactivators of certain EGR target promoters, including LHβ, perhaps the best established physiological target of EGR1. NAB coactivation was also observed using both various synthetic minimal promoters and the promoter of the Fas ligand gene, a putative Egr2/Egr3 target gene (27.Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 28.Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3222-3227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both NAB1 and NAB2 can function as EGR coactivators, and this coactivation is dependent upon the NAB-EGR interaction. NAB coactivation occurs independently of EGR transactivation domains and SF-1-binding sites, and maps to the NCD2 domain previously implicated in NAB corepression.Comparison of NAB-activated and NAB-repressed EGR-responsive promoters suggested a positive correlation between the observation of NAB repression and the presence of GC-rich sequences in a given promoter. In principle, GC-rich sequences might influence NAB function through an effect on promoter melting requirements for transcriptional initiation or by recruiting the ubiquitously expressed Sp1 transactivator, which binds a GC-rich consensus site (GGCGGG). However, analysis of chimeric, mutant, and synthetic promoters demonstrated that both the nature and the number of a promoter's EGR-binding sites ultimately determine NAB function.An ability to both activate and repress transcriptional activity has previously been reported for a number of proteins, including WT1, YY1, p53, retinoblastoma protein, Dorsal, RORα, various prokaryotic transactivators (49.van der Woude M.W. Kaltenbach L.S. Low D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 50.Ansari A.Z. Bradner J.E. O'Halloran T.V.

WT1, the Wilms tumor suppressor protein, is related to EGR proteins in its DNA-binding domain and binds a similar consensus site (52.Rauscher F.J. Morris J.F. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Its differential effects on transcription have been mapped to independent activation and repression domains that may interact with various cellular proteins (53.Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Gurrieri M. Huang J. Deuel T.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1243-1247PubMed Google Scholar). In several other cases of activator/repressor proteins, such as RORα (54.Harding H.P. Atkins G.B. Jaffe A.B. Seo W.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1737-1746PubMed Google Scholar) and the HIV Tat protein (55.Brown J.A. Howcroft T.K. Singer D.S. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1998; 17: 9-16Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), separate activation and repression domains have also been identified. Concentration-dependent activity switches have been reported for other repressor/activators such as p53, which can activate at low levels and repress at higher levels (56.Kristjuhan A. Maimets T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and BSAP, which at low levels reportedly activates transcription from high affinity binding sites but at higher concentrations represses transcription from low affinity sites (57.Wallin J.J. Gackstetter E.R. Koshland M.E. Science. 1998; 279: 1961-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The activity of Dorsal depends on binding of factors to adjacent DNA sites (58.Ip Y.T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas the corepressor Rb can activate transcription through interactions with factors such as MyoD (59.Sellers W.R. Novitch B.G. Miyake S. Heith A. Otterson G.A. Kaye F.J. Lassar A.B. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). YY1 activates or represses in a complex pattern that may depend both on its intrinsic DNA-bending ability and on interactions with promoter-bound factors (60.Natesan S. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5975-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 61.Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).A bacteriophage activator/repressor protein, p4 from phage φ29, is reminiscent of NAB proteins in the use of a single protein domain to carry out both repression and activation. The interaction between p4 and bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) leads to activation or repression depending on the strength of the sigma A-binding site (62.Monsalve M. Calles B. Mencia M. Salas M. Rojo F. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). At a weak binding site, p4-directed transcription is activated through recruitment and stabilization of RNAP; at a strong binding site, bound RNAP is overstabilized and trapped at the promoter, leading to transcriptional repression. Fig. 10depicts a similar model as applied to NAB activity. According to this hypothetical scheme, the NAB NCD2 domain might interact with the mammalian RNA polymerase complex either directly or through an unidentified bridging factor. At promoters with few or low affinity EGR-binding sites, such an interaction might result in productive recruitment of the transcriptional machinery and NAB coactivation. At promoters with higher affinity and/or greater numbers of EGR-binding sites, cooperative interactions between bound NAB-EGR complexes and the NCD2-interacting factor could result in trapping of the overstabilized polymerase complex, reduced promoter clearance, and NAB repression. Testing of this model would require the identification of NCD2 target(s) and the development of promoter clearance assays in NAB-regulated transcriptional systems.Initial analysis of NAB proteins suggested that their interaction with EGR proteins would transform an EGR transactivator into an EGR-NAB repressor complex. Results described in this study suggest that, at certain promoters such as LHβ, NAB proteins can amplify an EGR-directed transcriptional response. This novel activation function of NAB proteins may help to explain the association of a mutation in the NAB-binding domain of EGR2 (I268N) with a recessive case of human myelinopathy (30.Warner L.E. Svaren J. Milbrandt J. Lupski J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1245-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Myelinopathies result from Schwann cell defects leading to abnormal myelination, and these particular cases are presumably caused by misregulation of one or more EGR2 target genes. If NAB proteins function as repressors of a critical target gene, one might expect a single, derepressed allele of EGR2(I268N) to up-regulate markedly target gene transcription, leading to a dominant inheritance pattern. But if NAB proteins function instead as coactivators of a critical EGR2 target gene, mutation of both EGR2 alleles might be required to decrease significantly EGR-directed transcription, and recessive disease transmission would be predicted. Further elucidation of the role of NAB proteins in human myelinopathies awaits the identification of critical EGR2 target genes within Schwann cells, but the association of a mutation in the NAB-binding domain of EGR2 with human disease highlights the importance of coregulatory proteins such as NAB1 and NAB2 in transcriptional control.

https://openalex.org/W2055612111,"Synaptotagmins (Syts) are a large family of membrane proteins consisted of at least 12 isoforms. They are categorized in neuron-specific isoforms (I-V, X, and XI) and ubiquitous isoforms (VI–IX) based on their expression patterns. Syt-I, a neuron-specific and abundant isoform, has been well characterized and postulated to be the exocytotic Ca2+ sensor. However, the functions of other isoforms remain obscure. Here, we report that ubiquitous isoforms of synaptotagmins, Syt-VII, Syt-VIII, and Syt-IX, interacted with a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein, SYNCRIP (Synaptotagmin-binding, cytoplasmicRNA-interacting protein), through their C2B domains. SYNCRIP was originally found in the Syt-II C2AB domain bound fraction from the mouse brain lysate. cDNA cloning of SYNCRIP cDNA revealed that the protein was highly homologous to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R (hnRNP R) recently identified. SYNCRIP protein was ubiquitously and constantly expressed in various tissues of mice parallel to hnRNP R. SYNCRIP indeed bound RNA with preference to poly(A) RNA; however, in contrast to the nuclear localization of hnRNP R, SYNCRIP was distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm as judged by both biochemical fractionation and immunohistochemical studies. In vitro binding experiments showed the potential interaction of SYNCRIP with C2B domains of Syts except for those of Syt-V, -VI, and -X. Furthermore, the interaction between SYNCRIP and Syt-VII, -VIII, or -IX was revealed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using COS cells transiently expressing each Syt isoform. These findings suggested that SYNCRIP was a target of ubiquitous type of Syts and implied the involvement of ubiquitous Syts in the regulation of dynamics of the cytoplasmic mRNA. Synaptotagmins (Syts) are a large family of membrane proteins consisted of at least 12 isoforms. They are categorized in neuron-specific isoforms (I-V, X, and XI) and ubiquitous isoforms (VI–IX) based on their expression patterns. Syt-I, a neuron-specific and abundant isoform, has been well characterized and postulated to be the exocytotic Ca2+ sensor. However, the functions of other isoforms remain obscure. Here, we report that ubiquitous isoforms of synaptotagmins, Syt-VII, Syt-VIII, and Syt-IX, interacted with a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein, SYNCRIP (Synaptotagmin-binding, cytoplasmicRNA-interacting protein), through their C2B domains. SYNCRIP was originally found in the Syt-II C2AB domain bound fraction from the mouse brain lysate. cDNA cloning of SYNCRIP cDNA revealed that the protein was highly homologous to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R (hnRNP R) recently identified. SYNCRIP protein was ubiquitously and constantly expressed in various tissues of mice parallel to hnRNP R. SYNCRIP indeed bound RNA with preference to poly(A) RNA; however, in contrast to the nuclear localization of hnRNP R, SYNCRIP was distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm as judged by both biochemical fractionation and immunohistochemical studies. In vitro binding experiments showed the potential interaction of SYNCRIP with C2B domains of Syts except for those of Syt-V, -VI, and -X.

Vesicles-based transport, which is budding of the vesicles carrying some particular molecules from a donor compartment and fusion of these vesicles with an acceptor membrane, is a fundamental mechanism for this process. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF)1 attachment protein (SNAP) receptors (SNAREs) are revealed to be core molecules underlying the mechanism by recent genetic and biochemical studies (1.Rothman J.E.

In neurotransmitter release of the mammalian presynaptic terminus, where electrophysiological studies have been utilized to detect the fusion of synaptic vesicles with axon-terminal plasma membranes and the great advancement in identifying the core molecules has been accomplished, the synaptic vesicle protein, vesicle-associated membrane protein 1 or 2, and the two presynaptic membrane proteins, syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25, serve as the v-SNARE and the t-SNAREs, respectively (2.Hanson P.I.

Syt-I, an integral membrane protein characterized by a short N terminus, a single transmembrane region, and two C2 domains (the C2A and C2B domains) homologous to the C2 regulatory region of protein kinase C (10.Südhof T.C.

Subsequent studies on the SNARE proteins have revealed that each of these molecules constitutes a large gene family and their distinct tissue or intracellular distributions, and suggested their general roles in membrane trafficking and the isoform-specific involvement in the vesicle trafficking at distinct intracellular organelles (15.Bennett M.K.

In line with these, Syts have been also found to be a large family consisting of at least 12 isoforms in rats or mice (11.Schiavo G. Osborne S.L. Sgouros J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19.Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Although the role of Syt-I and -II as a Ca2+ sensor in synaptic vesicle fusion has been established and the regulatory roles of other Syts in the SNARE-based vesicle trafficking were examined, detailed characterizations on the intracellular localization of other Syt isoforms remain immature. We have found that inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) bound the C2B domains of Syts-I, -II, -IV, -VI to IX, and -XI (20.Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Ibata K. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12267-12273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and demonstrated the potential role of inositol high polyphosphate series (IHPS: IP4, inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (IP5), and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6)) in the regulation of Syts-regulated vesicular trafficking (22.Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For example, binding of an inositol high polyphosphate to the C2B domain of the neuron-specific and abundant isoform of Syt caused the inhibition of the fusion step of synaptic vesicle with the presynaptic plasma membrane (23.Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Lewis F.M.T. Sugimori M. Niinobe Mkoshiba K. Llinás R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10703-10707Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24.Mochida S. Fukuda M.

Mikoshiba K. Kumakura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 92: 10708-10712Google Scholar). During the course of studies to clarify the molecular base of this inhibition, we found that several proteins including the clathrin adaptor complex, AP-2, 66-, 43-, and 33-kDa proteins, interacted with the C2AB domain of Syt-II immobilized on beads matrix and were competitively released from the complex by IHPS (26.Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we report that a 66-kDa protein in the C2AB domain-bound fraction was a RNA-binding protein with preference to poly(A) RNA and directly interacted with the C2B domain of Syts through its C-terminal region in vitro. Thus, we named the protein SYNCRIP (Synaptotagmin-binding, cytoplasmicRNA-interacting protein). Furthermore, in vivo, SYNCRIP specifically interacted with ubiquitous isoforms of Syts, Syt-VII, Syt-VIII, and Syt-IX, in accordance with the ubiquitous tissue distribution of SYNCRIP. On the basis of these results, we discuss the role of ubiquitous Syt isoforms in the dynamics of cytoplasmic mRNA, especially the involvement in vesicle-based transport of mRNA. Lysyl endopeptidase from Achromobacter lyticus was purchased from Wako. [α-32P]dCTP,l-[35S]methionine, poly(A) RNA, poly(C) RNA, poly(U) RNA, poly(A) DNA, and poly(A)-Sepharose were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Poly(U)-Sephadex and LipofectAMINE reagent were from Life Technologies, Inc. BcaBEST dideoxy sequencing kit and Pyrobest DNA polymerase were from Takara. TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems was purchased from Promega. All other reagents were analytical grade or the highest grade available. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing various fragments of Syts were expressed and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (21.Ibata K. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12267-12273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Partial purification of SYNCRIP was performed as described previously with minor modification (26.Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fifty grams (wet weight) of mice whole brains were homogenized in 250 ml of 10 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin A with glass-Teflon homogenizer (930 rpm, 10 strokes). After removing the debris and crude nuclear fraction by low speed centrifugation (1,000 × g, 10 min), Triton X-100 was added to give the final concentration of 1%(w/v) to the S1 fraction followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The solubilized fraction was obtained by centrifugation (16,000 ×g for 30 min) and incubated with 5 mg of purified GST-Syt II C2AB protein for 4 h at 4 °C. One ml (50% slurry) of glutathione-Sepharose was added to the mixture followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with wash buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), the bound proteins were eluted with 100 μm IP6 in wash buffer. The eluted proteins were further separated on MonoQ column chromatography. A 66-kDa protein was eluted at around 0.2 mNaCl, pH 8.0. The fractions enriched with the 66-kDa protein were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. The 66-kDa protein band was excised from the gel and digested with lysyl endopeptidase essentially according to the method as described (27.Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). The resultant polypeptides were separated by C-18 reverse-phase column (μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected on a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peptide sequence of each peptide was determined by PE Biosystems 492 protein sequencer. Two degenerate primers corresponding to digested peptide 1 (VTEGLTDVILYHQPDDK) were synthesized as follows: sense primers, 5′GTNACNGA(AG)GGN(TC)TNAC3′ based on VTEGLT, and antisense primers, 5′(TC)TT(AG)TC(AG)TCNGG(TC)TG(AG)TG(AG)TA3′ based on YHQPDDK. 35 cycles of PCR amplification were performed using mouse cerebellum random-primed, first-strand cDNA as a template. The 51-bp PCR product was cloned into pT7Blue (Novagen), confirmed by sequencing, and used as the authentic probe. About 5.0 × 105 plaques from a mouse cerebellum random-primed cDNA library in λgt11 were screened with the 51-bp probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. The 5′ or 3′ end fragment (∼200-bp) of clone 1a was used as a hybridization probe for re-screening or screening a mouse cerebellum oligo(dT)-primed λgt11 cDNA library to obtain full-length SYNCRIP cDNA. Cloned cDNAs were subcloned into pBluescript and sequenced on both directions by dideoxy chain termination method using [α-32P]dCTP. A His6-tagged recombinant protein containing the N-terminal region of SYNCRIP (aa 1–170) was expressed inEscherichia coli and partially purified with ProBond resin (Invitrogen), followed by MonoQ column chromatography to thoroughly purify. A Japanese White rabbit was immunized with 300 μg of the purified protein by subcutaneous injection with the complete Freund's adjuvant at a 14-day interval. The affinity purified antibody (anti-SYNCRIP-N antibody) was obtained from the antisera against the affinity column covalently coupled with a GST fusion protein carrying the corresponding region with the antigenic protein. Antibody against a peptide (aa 140–152 of SYNCRIP) was produced in rabbit with the injection of the peptide cross-linked with keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the artificially introduced Cys residue to the N terminus of the peptide. Anti-peptide antibody (anti-SYNCRIP-Pep antibody) was affinity purified with the antigenic peptide-conjugated beads. For transient expression of SYNCRIP in COS-7 cells, full-length, N-terminally truncated (ΔN, Δaa 1–98) and C-terminally truncated (ΔC, Δaa 401–561) SYNCRIP cDNAs introduced withEcoRI and XhoI sites in 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, by standard PCR-based methods were subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). Each construct was transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty eight hours after transfection, the expression of each construct was examined by Western blotting or indirect immunofluorescence study (see below). For expression of SYNCRIP in Sf9 cells, the full-length SYNCRIP cDNA was subcloned into pFASTBAC1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and recombinant baculovirus carrying SYNCIRP was created and amplified by following the manufacturer's instructions. Sf9 cells cultured in TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum were infected with the amplified recombinant viruses. Cells were harvested 48 h after infection and proceeded for the binding experiments (see below). 35S-Labeled SYNCRIP was generated by in vitro translation using TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems. Each aliquot of 35S-SYNCRIP was incubated with indicated amount of each poly(A) RNA or yeast tRNA in 50 μl of the binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaCl) for 30 min at 25 °C. 50 μl of poly(U)-Sephadex (20% slurry in the binding buffer) was added to each mixture followed by incubation for 45 min at 25 °C. After washing the beads with 500 μl of the binding buffer 4 times, the bound fractions were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Direct binding of SYNCRIP to poly(A) RNA was examined by using poly(A)-Sepharose with the binding buffer containing indicated concentration of NaCl. For comparison of the binding ability of SYNCRIP for poly(A) RNA versus DNA, indicated amount of poly(A) RNA or poly(A) DNA was incubated with 35S-SYNCRIP, followed by the analysis of poly(A)-Sepharose-bound SYNCRIP at 100 mmNaCl as described above. Inhibitory effects of soluble competitors were quantified by FUJIX BAS 2000 system from three independent experiments. The lysate was prepared from COS-7 cells expressing each SYNCRIP protein by homogenization of the cells in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin A, followed by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, for 20 min at 4 °C). Each lysate was incubated with equal amount of GST-Syt-II C2B protein for 2 h at 4 °C. GST-Syt-II C2B protein-bound fractions were pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose and examined by Western blotting with anti-SYNCRIP-Pep antibody. Mouse whole brain detergent extracts (2.5 mg/ml) were prepared in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 140 mmNaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin A. Each 3 ml of aliquots was added with EGTA (2 mm, the final concentration), CaCl2 (1 mm), EDTA (2 mm), or MgCl2 (1 mm) and incubated with 25 μg of each purified GST fusion protein carrying various parts of Syt-II or GST alone for 2 h at 4 °C. After adding 50 μl (50% slurry) of glutathione-Sepharose and another 1-h incubation, the resins were extensively washed with the extract buffer containing each chelator or divalent ion, and bound proteins were examined by Western blotting for SYNCRIP with anti-SYNCRIP-N antibody. The lysate was prepared from Sf9 cells expressing full-length SYNCRIP as above. Each aliquot was incubated with 10–20 μg of GST-C2B of various Syts. Bound proteins were pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-SYNCRIP-N antibody. A His6-tagged recombinant protein containing the C-terminal region of SYNCRIP (aa 401–561) was expressed inE. coli using pRSET plasmid (Invitrogen). The recombinant protein was recovered from inclusion bodies by using denaturing solution (6 m guanidine HCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and purified with ProBond resin. The denatured recombinant protein was processed for refolding by dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, with gradually reducing the concentration of urea, from 6 to 0.001 m. The dialysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C to remove malfolded and insoluble parts. After aliquots were incubated with various GST fusion proteins, bound proteins were pulled down and examined by Western blotting with anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen). Each Syt tagged with T7 epitope in the N terminus (42.Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was transiently transfected into COS cells. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and homogenized into 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin. The lysates were prepared by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 20 min) and incubated with affinity purified anti-SYNCRIP-N antibody (3.5 μg antibody/1 ml lysate) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with 10 μl (50% slurry) of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads with the homogenized buffer 5 times, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting for SYNCRIP and T7-tagged Syts. Forty-eight hours after transfection, COS-7 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and immediately washed with PBS 3 times. After blocking with 2% normal goat serum in PBS, cells were incubated with anti-SYNCRIP-N antibody (0.27 μg/ml) or anti-SYNCRIP-Pep antibody (0.55 μg/ml) in the blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS 5 times, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector, Burlingame, CA). For native tissues, ICR mice at postnatal 7th day stage was perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS(−), and excised brains were immersed for 2 h in the same fixative and cryosectioned (8 μm thick). Each section was dried and rehydrated in PBS, followed by immuno-reaction as described above. Immunofluorescence was observed using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. Specificity of SYNCRIP immunoreactivity was confirmed by parallel experiments using the preimmune serum or anti-SYNCRIP antibody preincubated with excess amounts of the antigenic polypeptide. Subcellular fractionation of P7 mouse cerebella was carried out exactly as described previously (28.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 29.Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Proteins with the amounts indicated in the figure legends were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting. Blots were blocked with 5% skim milk in 0.1% Tween 20, PBS (T-PBS) and then incubated with anti-SYNCRIP-N antibody (0.1 μg/ml) or anti-SYNCRIP-Pep antibody (0.23 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. After extensively washing with T-PBS, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin used as a standard. We previously reported that several proteins bound the C2AB domain of Syt-II and were competitively released by inositol high polyphosphates series (IHPS) (26.Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). AP2 complex was one of these proteins and seemed to be involved in the IHPS-induced blockade of synaptic transmission (23.Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Lewis F.M.T. Sugimori M. Niinobe Mkoshiba K. Llinás R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10703-10707Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24.Mochida S. Fukuda M. Niinobe M. Kobayashi H. Mikoshiba K. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, neither of the subunits of the AP2 complex recombinantly expressed directly interacted with the C2B domain. 2A. Mizutani and K. Mikoshiba, unpublished observations. Thus, we began to seek a molecule that directly interacted with the C2AB domain of Syt-II from the IP6 eluate. We separated the eluates by MonoQ column chromatography and found that a 66-kDa polypeptide eluted together with the AP2 complex directly interacted with the C2AB domain of Syt-II by far Western analysis using GST-Syt-II C2AB as a probe (Fig.1 A, and data not shown). The partial amino acid sequences of the 66-kDa protein were determined, and based on the sequence, we isolated cDNAs of the 66-kDa protein from mouse cerebellum cDNA library. Several overlapping clones were isolated and gave an open reading frame of 1683 nucleotides coding for a protein of 561 amino acids with a calculated mass of 62.5 kDa (Fig.1 B). Homology analyses of the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned cDNA revealed that it was highly homologous (81.2% identical) to human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R (hnRNP R); the molecular structure was recently defined by Hassfeld et al.(30.Hassfeld W. Chan E.K.L. Mathison D.A. Portman D. Dreyfuss G. Steiner G. Tan E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). They also reported that hnRNP R was an 82-kDa polypeptide and was localized in the nucleoplasm. During the course of isolating cDNA clones, we found clone 18 coding mouse hnRNP R (99.1% identical to aa298–633 of human hnRNP R) indicating that the 66-kDa protein was a distinct molecule from hnRNP R (Fig. 1, B and C). Like hnRNP R, the 66-kDa protein had a relatively acidic N-terminal region followed by three sets of RNA binding domain (RBD) containing the canonical conserved octameric RNP-1 and hexameric RNP-2 consensus motifs. In the C-terminal region, as a whole, arginine and glycine residues were enriched, some portions of which formed RGG boxes, another type of RNA binding motif. Furthermore, tyrosine residues were also enriched in the N-terminal half of this region (Fig. 1,C and D), and YYGY tetrapeptides were found three times as seen in hnRNP R. The most striking difference was the lack of ∼70 amino acids of the C terminus in the 66-kDa protein, and these were found in hnRNP R. More recently, a cellular interactor of NS1, the major nonstructural parvovirus protein, has been cloned from human cDNA library, named NSAP1 (31.Harris C.E. Boden R.A. Astell C.R. J.

Besides these two proteins, the 66-kDa protein showed the high similarity (50–60% identical) to polyadenylate-binding proteins of various species in RBD regions among other RNA-binding proteins. We produced the two kinds of polyclonal antibodies against the 66-kDa protein as follows: one was against the N-terminal region of the 66-kDa (Fig. 1 C, boxed), anti-SYNCRIP-N antibody, and the other was against the peptide whose sequence was completely conserved between the 66-kDa protein and hnRNP R (Fig. 1 C, double-underlined); anti-SYNCRIP-Pep antibody. Both of these antibodies recognized the endogenous 66-kDa polypeptide in COS-7 cells lysates (Fig.2 A and Fig. 4 B) as well as 82- and 74-kDa polypeptides, hnRNP R itself, and its degradates, respectively (30.Hassfeld W.

When the full-length cDNA was transfected into COS-7 cells, the 66-kDa protein was overexpressed, and the protein was localized in the cytoplasm with both anti-SYNCRIP-N antibody and anti SYNCRIP-Pep antibody (Fig. 2, B andC). The nucleoplasmic staining of non-transfected cells with anti-SYNCRIP-Pep antibody (Fig. 2 C) was probably the signal of hnRNP R, since this peptide antibody more preferentially recognized hnRNP R than the 66-kDa protein by Western blotting (Fig.4 B). Moreover, the fluorescence signal of green fluorescence protein-fused 66-kDa protein was also detected only in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Subcellular fractionation of P7 mice cerebella showed that the 66-kDa protein was enriched in P3 (crude microsome) fraction as well as in P1 (cell debris and crude nucleus) fraction, whereas the 82-kDa hnRNP R was exclusively"

Down-modulation of c-Myc protein via antisense oligonucleotides blocked activation-induced FasL mRNA and protein expression and functional FasL expression in activated T cells and T cell lines. Further, FasL promoter activity in T cells is driven by overexpression of c-Myc and inhibited by expression of dominant-negative mutants of c-Myc and Max.

Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the immune system, apoptosis of lymphocytes is important not only as a mechanism to offset oncogenesis but also to prevent damage of host tissues by overly aggressive immune mechanisms (5.Brunner T. Yoo N.J. Griffith T.S. Ferguson T.A. Green D.R. Behring Inst. Res. Commun. 1997; 97: 161-174Google Scholar). Activation of T lymphocytes can therefore promote either cell proliferation or apoptotic cell death (5.Brunner T. Yoo N.J. Griffith T.S. Ferguson T.A. Green D.R. Behring Inst. Res. Commun. 1997; 97: 161-174Google Scholar). Previous studies using c-Myc antisense oligonucleotides (6.Shi Y. Glynn J.M. Guilbert L.J. Cotter T.G. Bissonnette R.P. Green D.R.

More recently, we (8.Brunner T. Mogil R.J. LaFace D. Yoo N.J. Machboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D.H. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Nature. 1995; 373: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar) and others (9.Dhein J. Walczak H. Baeumler C. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H.

Similarly, apoptosis triggered by expression of c-Myc in fibroblasts has also recently been shown to depend on signaling via FasL/Fas interaction on the cell surface (12.Hueber A.O. Zornig M. Lyon D. Suda T. Nagata S. Evan G.I. Science. 1997; 278: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Thus, the requirement for c-Myc in AICD indicates a role for c-Myc in the expression of FasL and/or Fas and/or an increased susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis.Because AICD appears to be regulated primarily at the level of FasL expression (5.Brunner T. Yoo N.J. Griffith T.S. Ferguson T.A. Green D.R. Behring Inst. Res. Commun. 1997; 97: 161-174Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that FasL expression is controlled by c-Myc. Here we report that inhibition of optimal c-Myc expression by treatment of T cells with antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to c-myc effectively blocked activation-induced expression of FasL mRNA and protein. To examine whether the requirement for c-Myc is at the level of transcription, we employed a reporter construct containing 1.2 kb upstream of the human FasL gene (13.Kasibhatla S. Brunner S. Genestier G. Echeverri E. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and found that this promoter is c-Myc-responsive and -dependent. These data are discussed in terms of the possibility that the FasL gene may be a direct or indirect transcriptional target for c-Myc.DISCUSSIONWhen T lymphocytes are optimally activated via ligation of the T cell receptor, they produce cytokines and proliferate, a phenomenon that is central to the induction of an antigen-specific immune response. However, since the original studies of Russell et al. (27.Russell J.H. White C.L. Loh D.Y. Meleedy-Rey P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2151-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and Lenardo (28.Lenardo M.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), it has been recognized thatrestimulation of a previously activated T cell can result in AICD. Presumably, this phenomenon contributes to immune regulation and the control of activated lymphocyte numbers. Intuitively, it may be reasoned that because only activated T cells pose a potential threat to immune homeostasis, it is only those cells that are in a state of activation (e.g. expressing c-Myc) that are susceptible to AICD.How does prior activation contribute to the sensitization of T cells to AICD? Recently, it was shown that previously activated T cells exposed to IL-2 down-regulate c-Flip, an endogenous inhibitor of Fas-mediated apoptosis (29.Refaeli Y. Van Parijs L. London C.A. Tschopp J. Abbas A.K. Immunity. 1998; 8: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Thus, an increase in sensitivity to Fas is one aspect of this effect. Here we have shown another: expression of c-Myc in activated T cells contributes to the transcriptional activation of the FasL promoter. This accounts for the requirement for c-Myc in AICD and provides a mechanism for the relationship between FasL expression and the prior activation status of the T cell.The observation that c-Myc is required for activation-induced FasL expression and AICD in T cells helps to account for the ability of transforming growth factor β to block this process (30.Genestier L. Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that may have a role in producing resistance of Th2 T cells to AICD and allowing their proliferation (31.Zhang X. Giangreco L. Broome H.E. Dargan C.M. Swain S.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that transforming growth factor β inhibits c-Myc expression in T hybridoma cells and that enforced expression of c-Myc restores AICD and FasL expression (30.Genestier L. Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).In T cell hybridomas and previously activated T cells, c-Myc expression is constitutive 2T. Brunner and D. R. Green, unpublished results., and such cells are susceptible to activation-induced apoptosis (8.Brunner T. Mogil R.J. LaFace D. Yoo N.J. Machboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D.H.

Nature. 1995; 373: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), presumably at least in part for this reason. This suggests that activation-induced FasL gene expression requires other transcription factors in addition to Myc/Max. Candidates include calcineurin-activated transcription factors such as NFAT as our previous findings (21.Brunner T. Yoo N.J. LaFace D. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Int. Immunol. 1996; 9: 1017-1026Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and those of others (9.Dhein J. Walczak H. Baeumler C. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H.

Immunol. 1994; 24: 2469-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) showed that activation-induced FasL expression is cyclosporin A- and FK506-sensitive. Recently, Latinis et al. (33.Latinis K.M. Carr L.L. Peterson E.J. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4602-4611PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the region 486 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site in the FasL promoter contains two NFAT sites and that mutating these sites abrogated FasL reporter activity. In addition, we have recently shown that activation of NF-κB is important for optimal activation-induced FasL expression, due to an NF-κB site in the 1.2-kb promoter (34.Kasibhatla S. Genestier L. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 987-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).Several genes have been shown to be regulated by the “classical” Myc E-box containing enhancer elements including prothymosin α, ornithine decarboxylase, elongation initiation factors 2a and 4E, p53, cyclin D1, and Cdc25 (35.Eilers M.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4754-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The ornithine decarboxylase gene is directly induced by the Myc/Max heterodimer through two c-Myc recognition sites in its first intron. Overexpression of ornithine decarboxylase in cell lines is transforming (43.Auvinen M. Paasinen A. Andersson L.C. Holtta E. Nature. 1992; 360: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and also appears to mediate c-Myc-mediated susceptibility to apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal (44.Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5741-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Another recently identified target gene of the c-Myc/Max heterodimer is cdc25A, a cyclin-dependent, kinase-activating phosphatase that plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression. c-Myc/Max heterodimers bind directly to the cdc25A promoter through Myc/Max consensus sequences and activate transcription (45.Galaktionov K. Chen X. Beach D. Nature. 1996; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Cdc25A can also mediate transformation and appears to promote c-Myc-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts. In general, these studies point to a role for cell cycle progression in some forms of c-Myc-induced apoptosis, and some investigators have therefore suggested that such apoptosis is caused by inappropriate entry into the cell cycle through a cell cycle checkpoint (46.Bissonnette R.P. Shi Y. Mahboubi A. Glynn J.M. Green D.R. Tomei L.D. Cope F.O. Apoptosis II: The Molecular Basis of Apoptosis in Disease. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 327-356Google Scholar). Our finding that c-Myc regulates the expression of FasL in T cells connects c-Myc to apoptotic cell death through engagement of the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway. Whether any of these genes or another gene is responsible for indirectly activating the FasL promoter is not known. Alternatively, c-Myc may act directly on the promoter via a noncanonical site.In addition to activation-induced cell death in T cells, fibroblasts are probably the most extensively studied system for Myc-induced apoptosis (1.Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). The recent finding that Myc-induced apoptosis in serum-starved fibroblasts is dependent on Fas/FasL interactions (12.Hueber A.O. Zornig M. Lyon D. Suda T. Nagata S. Evan G.I. Science. 1997; 278: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) helps to support our finding that fasL is a target gene of c-Myc. These authors, however, were reportedly unable to measure the very low levels of FasL expression in these cells and did not observe changes upon c-Myc expression.Cell types other than T cells are capable of expressing FasL. Of particular interest is the finding that tumor cells such as colon carcinomas (47.O'Connell J. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. Shanahan F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), melanomas (48.Hahne M. Rimoldi D. Schroter M. Romero P. Schreier M. French L.E. Schneider P. Bornard T. Fontana A. Lienhard D. Cerottini J. Tschopp J. Science. 1996; 274: 1363-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar), and lung carcinomas (49.Niehans G.A. Brunner T. Frizelle S.P. Liston J.C. Salerno C.T. Knapp D.J. Green D.R. Kratzke R.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1007-1012PubMed Google Scholar) can express FasL in a constitutive manner. Although we expect that these transformed cells constitutively express c-Myc, they presumably lack other T cell receptor-derived signals. It is possible that c-Myc expression in these cell types is sufficient for FasL expression or that activation-induced signals are replaced by others. Detailed analysis of FasL expression in these cell types should bring further insight into the alternative regulation of FasL expression in non-T cells. Many tumor cells are insensitive to Fas cross-linking and/or express low levels of Fas (47.O'Connell J. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. Shanahan F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 48.Hahne M. Rimoldi D. Schroter M. Romero P. Schreier M. French L.E. Schneider P. Bornard T. Fontana A. Lienhard D. Cerottini J. Tschopp J. Science. 1996; 274: 1363-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, FasL expression on tumor cells can have immunological consequences resulting either in inhibition of antitumor immunity (47.O'Connell J. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. Shanahan F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 48.Hahne M. Rimoldi D. Schroter M. Romero P. Schreier M. French L.E. Schneider P. Bornard T. Fontana A. Lienhard D. Cerottini J.

Thus, the inhibition of c-Myc expression in such cells might effectively down-regulate FasL expression, providing an attractive route to the generation of effective antitumor responses. Uncontrolled proliferation of nearly any cell in a complex animal can be catastrophic, and therefore the expansion of cells is tightly regulated. One mechanism of such regulation is the induction of apoptosis, especially by those cellular events that also promote entry into the cell cycle. Thus, c-Myc (1.Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S.

Intuitively, it may be reasoned that because only activated T cells pose a potential threat to immune homeostasis, it is only those cells that are in a state of activation (e.g. expressing c-Myc) that are susceptible to AICD.How does prior activation contribute to the sensitization of T cells to AICD? Recently, it was shown that previously activated T cells exposed to IL-2 down-regulate c-Flip, an endogenous inhibitor of Fas-mediated apoptosis (29.Refaeli Y. Van Parijs L. London C.A. Tschopp J. Abbas A.K. Immunity. 1998; 8: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Thus, an increase in sensitivity to Fas is one aspect of this effect. Here we have shown another: expression of c-Myc in activated T cells contributes to the transcriptional activation of the FasL promoter. This accounts for the requirement for c-Myc in AICD and provides a mechanism for the relationship between FasL expression and the prior activation status of the T cell.The observation that c-Myc is required for activation-induced FasL expression and AICD in T cells helps to account for the ability of transforming growth factor β to block this process (30.Genestier L. Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Green D.R. J. Exp.

Recently, we showed that transforming growth factor β inhibits c-Myc expression in T hybridoma cells and that enforced expression of c-Myc restores AICD and FasL expression (30.Genestier L.

The ornithine decarboxylase gene is directly induced by the Myc/Max heterodimer through two c-Myc recognition sites in its first intron. Overexpression of ornithine decarboxylase in cell lines is transforming (43.Auvinen M. Paasinen A. Andersson L.C. Holtta E. Nature. 1992; 360: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and also appears to mediate c-Myc-mediated susceptibility to apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal (44.Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5741-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Another recently identified target gene of the c-Myc/Max heterodimer is cdc25A, a cyclin-dependent, kinase-activating phosphatase that plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression. c-Myc/Max heterodimers bind directly to the cdc25A promoter through Myc/Max consensus sequences and activate transcription (45.Galaktionov K. Chen X. Beach D. Nature. 1996; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Cdc25A can also mediate transformation and appears to promote c-Myc-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts. In general, these studies point to a role for cell cycle progression in some forms of c-Myc-induced apoptosis, and some investigators have therefore suggested that such apoptosis is caused by inappropriate entry into the cell cycle through a cell cycle checkpoint (46.Bissonnette R.P. Shi Y. Mahboubi A. Glynn J.M. Green D.R. Tomei L.D. Cope F.O. Apoptosis II: The Molecular Basis of Apoptosis in Disease. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 327-356Google Scholar). Our finding that c-Myc regulates the expression of FasL in T cells connects c-Myc to apoptotic cell death through engagement of the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway. Whether any of these genes or another gene is responsible for indirectly activating the FasL promoter is not known. Alternatively, c-Myc may act directly on the promoter via a noncanonical site.In addition to activation-induced cell death in T cells, fibroblasts are probably the most extensively studied system for Myc-induced apoptosis (1.Evan G.I.

The recent finding that Myc-induced apoptosis in serum-starved fibroblasts is dependent on Fas/FasL interactions (12.Hueber A.O. Zornig M. Lyon D. Suda T. Nagata S. Evan G.I. Science. 1997; 278: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) helps to support our finding that fasL is a target gene of c-Myc. These authors, however, were reportedly unable to measure the very low levels of FasL expression in these cells and did not observe changes upon c-Myc expression.Cell types other than T cells are capable of expressing FasL. Of particular interest is the finding that tumor cells such as colon carcinomas (47.O'Connell J. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. Shanahan F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), melanomas (48.Hahne M. Rimoldi D. Schroter M. Romero P. Schreier M. French L.E. Schneider P. Bornard T. Fontana A. Lienhard D.

Although we expect that these transformed cells constitutively express c-Myc, they presumably lack other T cell receptor-derived signals. It is possible that c-Myc expression in these cell types is sufficient for FasL expression or that activation-induced signals are replaced by others. Detailed analysis of FasL expression in these cell types should bring further insight into the alternative regulation of FasL expression in non-T cells. Many tumor cells are insensitive to Fas cross-linking and/or express low levels of Fas (47.O'Connell J. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. Shanahan F. J. Exp.

Nevertheless, FasL expression on tumor cells can have immunological consequences resulting either in inhibition of antitumor immunity (47.O'Connell J. O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. Shanahan F. J. Exp.

Thus, the inhibition of c-Myc expression in such cells might effectively down-regulate FasL expression, providing an attractive route to the generation of effective antitumor responses. When T lymphocytes are optimally activated via ligation of the T cell receptor, they produce cytokines and proliferate, a phenomenon that is central to the induction of an antigen-specific immune response. However, since the original studies of Russell et al. (27.Russell J.H. White C.L. Loh D.Y. Meleedy-Rey P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2151-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and Lenardo (28.Lenardo M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2050592909,"We investigated the effects of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), a key cytokine involved in inflammatory lung disease, on phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) biosynthesis in a murine alveolar type II epithelial cell line (MLE-12). TNFα significantly inhibited [3H]choline incorporation into PtdCho after 24 h of exposure. TNFα reduced the activity of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), the rate-regulatory enzyme within the CDP-choline pathway, by 40% compared with control, but it did not alter activities of choline kinase or cholinephosphotransferase. Immunoblotting revealed that TNFα inhibition of CCT activity was associated with a uniform decrease in the mass of CCTα in total cell lysates, cytosolic, microsomal, and nuclear subfractions of MLE cells. Northern blotting revealed no effects of the cytokine on steady-state levels of CCTα mRNA, and CCTβ mRNA was not detected. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into immunoprecipitable CCTα protein in pulse and pulse-chase studies revealed that TNFα did not alterde novo synthesis of enzyme, but it substantially accelerated turnover of CCTα. Addition ofN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (ALLN), the calpain I inhibitor, or lactacystin, the 20 S proteasome inhibitor, blocked the inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis mediated by TNFα. TNFα-induced degradation of CCTα protein was partially blocked by ALLN or lactacystin. CCT was ubiquitinated, and ubiquitination increased after TNFα exposure. m-Calpain degraded both purified CCT and CCT in cellular extracts. Thus, TNFα inhibits PtdCho synthesis by modulating CCT protein stability via the ubiquitin-proteasome and calpain-mediated proteolytic pathways. We investigated the effects of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), a key cytokine involved in inflammatory lung disease, on phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) biosynthesis in a murine alveolar type II epithelial cell line (MLE-12). TNFα significantly inhibited [3H]choline incorporation into PtdCho after 24 h of exposure. TNFα reduced the activity of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), the rate-regulatory enzyme within the CDP-choline pathway, by 40% compared with control, but it did not alter activities of choline kinase or cholinephosphotransferase. Immunoblotting revealed that TNFα inhibition of CCT activity was associated with a uniform decrease in the mass of CCTα in total cell lysates, cytosolic, microsomal, and nuclear subfractions of MLE cells. Northern blotting revealed no effects of the cytokine on steady-state levels of CCTα mRNA, and CCTβ mRNA was not detected. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into immunoprecipitable CCTα protein in pulse and pulse-chase studies revealed that TNFα did not alterde novo synthesis of enzyme, but it substantially accelerated turnover of CCTα. Addition ofN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (ALLN), the calpain I inhibitor, or lactacystin, the 20 S proteasome inhibitor, blocked the inhibition of PtdCho biosynthesis mediated by TNFα. TNFα-induced degradation of CCTα protein was partially blocked by ALLN or lactacystin. CCT was ubiquitinated, and ubiquitination increased after TNFα exposure. m-Calpain degraded both purified CCT and CCT in cellular extracts. Thus, TNFα inhibits PtdCho synthesis by modulating CCT protein stability via the ubiquitin-proteasome and calpain-mediated proteolytic pathways. phosphatidylcholine, CCT, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, TNFα, tumor necrosis factor alpha, CDP-choline, cytidine diphosphocholine, DSPtdCho, disaturated phosphatidylcholine, ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO, Lyso-PtdCho, lysophosphatidylcholine phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride kilobase pairs 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho (1.Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar)),1 the most abundant mammalian phospholipid, has several well recognized roles, including serving as an integral component of pulmonary alveolar surfactant and providing the cell with a reservoir for the generation of bioactive lipid second messengers. The biosynthesis of PtdCho is tightly regulated within the CDP-choline pathway (1.Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A key step in this pathway is the conversion of choline phosphate to CDP-choline, which is catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT, EC 2.7.7.15 (1.Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar)).CCT localizes primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus (2.Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but it is also found associated with Golgi and transport vesicles (1.Kent C. Biochim. Biophys.

Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Positive and negative regulatory lipids govern CCT activity when presented within the context of a PtdCho lamellar structure. Activating lipids include unsaturated fatty acids, anionic phospholipids, and diacylglycerol, whereas negative regulatory lipids include sphingosine and lyso-PtdCho (4.Sohal P.S. Cornell R.B. J.

Phosphorylation of CCT modulates activity by attenuating lipid activation, and an inverse correlation exists between CCT phosphorylation and PtdCho synthesis in some systems (8.Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Protein kinases that phosphorylate purified CCT in vitro include p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase, protein kinase Cα, and casein kinase II (9.Wieprecht M. Wieder T. Paul C. Geilen C.C.

Although there is substantial evidence supporting regulation of CCT by biochemical and protein modification mechanisms, changes in the level of mRNA and protein have also been identified (11.Tessner T.G.

J. 1995; 312: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this regard, studies have shown that the developmental increase in CCT mRNA in alveolar epithelium is due to an increase in the stability of the CCT transcript (15.Hogan M. Kuliszewski M. Lee W. Post M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Three isoforms of CCT exist in cells as follows: CCTα, CCTβ1, and CCTβ2 (2.Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16.Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The 367-amino acid CCTα isoform contains four distinct functional domains including an amino-terminal nuclear targeting domain, a catalytic sequence, a regulatory domain consisting of amphipathic α-helices that interact with lipids, and a carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation domain. Unlike CCTα, the CCTβ isoforms lack a nuclear localization motif and differ in their carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites (2.Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16.Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the CCTβ isoforms exhibit full catalytic activity and, like CCTα, require the presence of lipid regulators for optimal activation. The control mechanisms underlying the differential expression of CCTα and CCTβ are not known.Several factors such as phorbol ester (17.Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2190-2197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) colony- stimulating factor 1 (11.Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16261-16264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cholecystokinin (13.Groblewski G.E. Wang Y. Ernst S.A. Kent C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1437-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and exogenous lipoproteins (18.Shiratori Y. Houweling M. Zha X. Tabas I. J. Biol.

Invest. 1997; 99: 2020-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have been used to modulate CCT activity to investigate the physiological mechanisms that govern PtdCho synthesis. In the lung, TNFα is a key cytokine released by alveolar macrophages that has been implicated as a major factor for inducing acute lung injury associated with sepsis (20.Niederman M.S. Fein A.M. Clin. Chest Med. 1990; 11: 633-656PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the manifestations of sepsis can be reproduced by thein vivo administration of this cytokine, and these deleterious effects can be attenuated by treatment with TNFα antibodies (21.Beutler B. Milsark I.W. Cerami A.C. Science. 1985; 229: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar).Sepsis-associated injury is characterized by elevated serum levels of TNFα and with reduced levels of PtdCho within critical organs (22.Hertzog J.H. Godinez M.H. Godinez R.I. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 22: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar,23.Arias-Diaz J. Vara E. Gomez M. Moreno A. Torres-Melero J. Balibrea J.L. Eur. J. Surg. 1993; 159: 535-539PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, one important feature of TNFα-induced acute lung injury is depletion of alveolar surfactant PtdCho, which may occur as a result of accelerated PtdCho hydrolysis (22.Hertzog J.H. Godinez M.H. Godinez R.I. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 22: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 24.Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 25.Candela M. Barker S.C. Ballou L.R. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1363-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TNFα stimulates PtdCho hydrolysis rapidly, often within minutes after cytokine exposure (26.Schutze S. Berkovic D. Tomsing O. Unger C. Kronke M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, there is limited information about long term effects of TNFα on phospholipid metabolism and whether the cytokine might regulate PtdCho biosynthesis. Thus, the primary objectives of this study were to investigate whether exposure to TNFα down-regulates PtdCho biosynthesis in alveolar epithelial cells and to characterize the mechanisms responsible for reduced cellular PtdCho levels after long term cytokine exposure. Recent studies demonstrating that TNFα suppresses [14C]glucose incorporation into disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPtdCho (27.Balibrea-Cantero J.L. Arias-Diaz J. Garcia C. Torres-Melero J. Simon C. Rodriguez J.M. Vara E. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 149: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)), a marker of surfactant phospholipid, led us to hypothesize that the inhibitory actions of TNFα on surfactant phospholipid metabolism might be mediated by inhibition of PtdCho synthesis at the CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase step.DISCUSSIONOur results show for the first time that TNFα modulates PtdCho synthesis by inhibiting CCT activity via proteolytic degradation of the enzyme. Based on the current results, it appears that specific degradative pathways exist in cells to control expression of CCT. These pathways include a constitutively active ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that may be important in regulating enzyme turnover under steady-state conditions. This system, together with an inducible calpain pathway, likely mediates TNFα effects on CCT proteolysis. The results should prompt investigations into the molecular mechanisms by which CCT is selected for degradation under normal or pro-inflammatory conditions. Results from such work could lead to maneuvers directed at modulation of these degradative pathways which in turn could serve as a means to control CCT lifespan within cells.TNFα decreased the activity of CCT selectively. In contrast to effects of interleukin-1β, there were no appreciable effects of TNFα on other enzymatic steps within the biosynthetic pathway (44.Belardelli F. Proietti E. Ciolli V. Sestili P. Carpinelli G. Di Vito M. Ferretti A. Woodrow D. Boraschi D. Podo F. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 44: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of MLE-12 cells and primary alveolar type II cells in both control and TNFα-treated extracts with antisera specific for the CCTα and CCTβ isoforms indicated that CCTα was the only isoform detected in these cells. Thus, from these and other recent results (2.Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), CCTα appears to be the predominant isoform involved in surfactant phospholipid synthesis in mature alveolar type II cell epithelium. Further analysis confirmed that inhibition of CCT activity was due to a reduction of total cellular enzyme mass. A global decrease in CCT protein was observed in all subcellular fractions that were analyzed (Fig. 2), arguing against the likelihood that a shift in cellular CCT content from a membrane-bound form to a cytosolic form accompanied the down-regulation of activity. It is unlikely that TNFα altered translational efficiency because metabolic labeling studies showed no changes in newly synthesized CCTα but clearly showed that the cytokine accelerated enzyme turnover. The native enzyme had a half-life (t 12 = ∼8 h) consistent with half-lives of other regulatory enzymes (45.Hargrove J.L. Schmidt F.H. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2360-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), but it was much more labile after cytokine stimulation (Fig. 4).There have been no prior studies that have investigated which proteolytic pathways control CCT turnover. Groblewski et al. (13.Groblewski G.E. Wang Y. Ernst S.A. Kent C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1437-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) showed that CCT can be degraded in response to cholecystokinin and these effects could be influenced by enzyme phosphorylation. The primary mechanisms for protein catabolism in viable cells include lysosomal proteolysis, calcium-activated neutral proteolysis (calpains), and the ATP-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Of these, the calpain and ubiquitin-proteasome systems have been most prominently identified in mediating TNFα proteolysis (42.Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar,43.Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar, 46.Llovera M. Garcia-Martinez C. Agell N. Lopez-Soriano F.J. Argiles J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For example, TNFα-induced IκBα proteolysis is mediated by both the calpain and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways (42.Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and IκBα degradation in response to the cytokine was also observed in our cells (data not shown). However, the kinetics of CCTα degradation in alveolar epithelial cells and IκBα degradation in HepG2 cells differ significantly (42.Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). IκBα is rapidly degraded within a few minutes with an 80% reduction in the half-life of the protein and is effectively eliminated during the acute phase response to TNFα. On the other hand, CCTα, a metabolic regulatory protein with an estimated half-life of 8 h, is degraded at a slower rate, and its half-life is reduced 56% in response to the cytokine (Fig.4 D). The differences between the kinetics of CCTα degradation and IκBα degradation are probably due to multiple factors. First, the various cellular responses to TNFα are dose- and time-dependent (47.Chaturvedi M.M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also cell type-dependent. For example, unlike proteolysis of IκBα, p21WAF1 proteolysis in ME-180 cells is not detectable until 4 h after TNF addition (42.Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 48.Donato N.J. Perez M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5067-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The kinetics of calpain-mediated proteolysis also differ with respect to different protein substrates due to the fact that there are multiple active forms of μ-calpain within cells that have unique substrate specificities and distinct functional roles (49.Schoenwaelder S.M. Kulkarni S. Salem H.H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Yamao-Harigaya W. Saido T.C. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24876-24884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Second, the molecular context of CCT can influence the rate of proteolysis. For example, the presence of DNA decreases the Ca2+ requirement for degradation of nuclear matrix proteins (50.Mellgren R.L. Song K. Mericle M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 653-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylation of connexin-32 prevents its proteolysis (51.Elvira M. Diez J.A. Wang K.K. Villalobo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14294-14300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), interaction of calmodulin with brain spectrin results in a marked acceleration of the rate of spectrin degradation by calpains (52.Seubert P. Baudry M. Dudek S. Lynch G. Synapse. 1987; 1: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and binding of polyamines to spermidine/spermineN 1-acetyltransferase prevents proteasomal degradation (53.Coleman C.S. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12164-12169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CCTα resistance to proteolytic degradation correlates with binding to membrane lipid (54.Craig L. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3311-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that nucleoplasmic CCTα might be more susceptible to digestion by calpain or the proteasome complex compared with CCTα located at membranous sites. In addition, the rate of CCTα modification by ubiquitination (Fig. 8) or phosphorylation in response to TNFα likely plays a role in determining the kinetics of proteolysis. CCTα phosphorylation stabilizes the protein from degradation in response to cholecystokinin (13.Groblewski G.E. Wang Y. Ernst S.A. Kent C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1437-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting by analogy that dephosphorylation could reduce its half-life in response to TNFα.These effects of TNFα-inducible CCT proteolysis are also partially blocked by inhibitors of either calpain or the 20 S proteasome. Interestingly, CCTα degradation was nearly completely blocked by the combination of both inhibitors. Perhaps more importantly, inhibition of the ubiquitin and calpain pathways totally abrogated the TNFα- induced decrease in DSPtdCho mass (Fig. 6). Lactacystin is a selective, potent, inhibitor of the proteasome without effects on either serine or cysteine proteases, whereas ALLN is less specific for cysteine proteases, such as calpain, especially at higher doses (55.Craiu A. Gaczynska M. Akopian T. Gramm C.F. Fenteany G. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13437-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed direct in vitro studies examining whether purified CCT was a substrate for catalytically active m-calpain, and it degraded purified CCT in a dose-dependent manner resulting in the generation of low molecular weight degradation products (Fig. 7). Our inability to detect similar proteolytic fragments in cells following TNFα treatment is probably due to several factors. The data indicate that CCTα is targeted by two proteolytic systems, as is IκBα where fragments also were not easily observed and Western blots required long gel exposures (42.Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Whereas two major fragments of about 40 and 20 kDa resulted from calpain digestion of purified CCTαin vitro (Fig. 7), recent studies indicate that the sizes of products of the 20 S and 26 S proteasome are only 500 Da (56.Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Such small products are only detected in vitro by more sensitive methods and would run near the dye front of the PAGE. Thus, the proteolytic fragments resulting from digestion by the combination of calpain and/or the proteasome are probably very small, on the order of 5–6 residues. Another factor contributing to this result is the fact that the analyses were performed at 4- to 8-h intervals following cytokine addition (Figs. 2 and 4), and it has been shown that proteasome fragments are subject to further rapid hydrolysis by endopeptidases (57.Botbol V. Scornik O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1942-1949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus probably eliminating the products of calpain/proteasome degradation.Because both ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathways have been described (58.Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), we performed additional studies to determine if CCT and ubiquitin coimmunoprecipitated. Our pulse-chase and sequential immunoprecipitation studies indicate that radiolabeled CCT, which represents a relatively small pool of total cellular enzyme, apparently is not ubiquitinated in the absence of TNFα (Fig. 8 D). However, it is likely that some CCT is targeted for ubiquitination under steady-state conditions perhaps as the enzyme becomes misfolded or modified post-synthetically (Fig.8 C). Thus, low levels of a constituently active ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway appear to regulate enzyme turnover in the native state. The activity of this pathway is stimulated after TNFα exposure, and results in a greater amount of CCT that becomes ubiquitinated (Fig. 8). We suspect that both the ubiquitin-proteasome and calpain systems may be relevant to CCT stability because purified CCT was a substrate for m-calpain in vitro, and these proteolytic systems localize both in the cytoplasm and nucleus (59.Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 60.Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C141-C152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanisms by which calpain and the proteasome are activated by TNFα and how CCT is targeted for degradation require further study. It appears that lipid mediators implicated in TNFα signaling can stimulate calpain activity (61.Xie H. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the other hand, proteins that are abnormally synthesized or modified post-translationally are often targeted for ubiquitination (42.Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 60.Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C141-C152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since TNFα alters oxidant tone within cells (62.Suzuki Y. Ohsugi K. Ono Y. Immunology. 1996; 87: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is possible that oxidation of CCT methionine residues, or other post-synthetic modifications such as serine phosphorylation, or alterations in NH2-terminal protein folding could destabilize the enzyme facilitating incorporation into the ubiquitin pathway.Unlike the present results showing alterations in CCT protein stability, most prior studies have shown that enzyme activity in cells is regulated by other post-translational events involving lipid regulation or changes in the degree of enzyme phosphorylation (1.Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These mechanisms might occur independently or act in concert with TNFα-induced CCT proteolysis. For example, the cytokine stimulates phospholipase A2 and neutral sphingomyelinase activities (24.Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 25.Candela M. Barker S.C. Ballou L.R. J. Exp.

Physiol. 1999; 276: L481-L490PubMed Google Scholar). One potential consequence of activation of these hydrolases is the generation of bioactive lipid intermediates such as lyso-PtdCho, ceramide, or potentially sphingosine which have been linked to inhibition of either CCT activity or PtdCho synthesis (4.Sohal P.S. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11746-11750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TNFα has been shown to stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as p42/p44 extracellularly regulated kinase and protein kinase Cα, which may modulate CCT activity by stimulating enzyme phosphorylation (9.Wieprecht M.

Whether these changes in enzyme phosphorylation or alterations in lipid association of CCT affect its vulnerability to proteolysis in the setting of TNFα exposure require further investigation.

FIP3 has also been shown to repress basal and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α-induced NF-κB activity as well as to induce cell death when overexpressed. The adenovirus E3–14.7-kDa protein (E3-14.7K) is an inhibitor of TNFα-induced cell death. In the current study, we generated deletion mutants to map the domains of FIP3, which are responsible for its various functions. The NF-κB inhibitory activity and the E3–14.7K binding domains were mapped at the carboxyl half of the FIP3 protein. We also found that the carboxyl-terminal half of FIP3 blocked TNFα-induced IκB-α phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, which suggests that the stabilization of the cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-κB underlies the FIP3 inhibition of NF-κB activity. The amino-terminal 119 amino acids were responsible for the FIP3-IKKβ and FIP3-IKKα interaction, and the middle of the protein (amino acids 201–300) appeared to be both the FIP3 self-association domain as well as the FIP3-Fas receptor-interacting protein interaction domain. Thus, FIP3 might serve as a scaffold protein to organize the various components of the IκB-α kinase complex. Whereas the full-length protein is required for efficient cell death, the amino-terminal 200 amino acids are sufficient to cause rounding and detachment of the cells from the monolayer.

We cloned FIP3, a 14.7K-interacting protein, from a human cDNA library, after it was identified in our yeast two-hybrid studies designed to look for cellular proteins that could interact with the adenovirus E3–14.7K protein (35.Li Y.

The E3–14.7-K protein is an inhibitor of TNFα-induced apoptosis (39.Horton T.M. Ranheim T.S. Aquino L. Kusher D.I. Saha S.K. Ware C.F. Wold W.S.M. Gooding L.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2629-2639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FIP3 has been shown to be essential for the activation of the NF-κB pathway, and mutations of FIP3 have been identified as the reason for the nonresponsiveness of two cell lines to NF-κB-inducing stimuli (36.Yamaoka S.

Antisense studies also showed that FIP3 plays an essential regulatory role in the IKK complex (37.Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Despite its importance in activation of the IκB-α kinase, it also plays an inhibitory role in the NF-κB pathway (35.Li Y.

When expression of FIP3 is increased by transient transfection, it down-regulates both basal and TNFα-induced NF-κB activity (35.Li Y. Kang J. Friedman J. Tarassishin L. Ye J. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. Horwitz M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). FIP3 has been shown to interact with IKKβ, RIP, and NF-κB-inducing kinase and to form homotypic oligomers (35.Li Y. Kang J. Friedman J. Tarassishin L. Ye J. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. Horwitz M.S. Proc.

FIP3 is also an apoptosis-inducing protein when overexpressed (35.Li Y. Kang J. Friedman J. Tarassishin L. Ye J. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. Horwitz M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which FIP3 is integrated into the TNFα apoptotic pathway has not been elucidated. In this manuscript we present the results of deletion studies of FIP3, which assign various FIP3 functions to different domains of the protein. We mapped the IKKα- and IKKβ-interacting activity to the amino-terminal 119 amino acids. The FIP3 self-association and the RIP interaction domains were located in a 100-amino acid segment in the middle of the protein. We also assigned the 14.7K-interacting and NF-κB down-regulation function of FIP3 within the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. The primary cell rounding function that results in detachment of the cells from the monolayer was mapped to the amino-terminal 200 amino acids of the FIP3 protein, whereas efficient cell killing required the full-length FIP3. Furthermore, we demonstrated that FIP3 prevented TNFα-induced IκB-α phosphorylation and degradation and located this activity to the same domain that is responsible for down-regulation of NF-κB. 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Mouse anti-T7 monoclonal antibody and HRP-conjugated anti-T7 antibody were purchased from Novagen. Mouse anti-FLAG and antipolyhistidine antibodies were from Sigma. Rabbit anti-IκB-α antibody, rabbit anti-IKKβ antibody, and mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. pcDNA3-FLAG-14.7K, pcDNA3-T7-FIP3 full-length, and a mutant with deletion of the amino-terminal 179 amino acids were constructed as described (35.Li Y.

All other FIP3 mutants were made by a polymerase chain reaction-based method using Pfupolymerase. The mutagenesis scheme is shown in Fig. 1 A, and mutant designations are described in the legend to Fig. 1 A. A BamHI site was introduced into all 5′-primers, and anXhoI site was introduced into all 3′-primers to facilitate cloning. Primer sequences are available upon request. All mutants were cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3-T7 vector in-frame with the 5′-T7 tag. The fidelity of the vector-insert junction was confirmed by sequencing. The constructs expressing FLAG-tagged IKKβ (pFLAG-CMV-IKKβ) and polyhistidine-tagged IKKα (pHIS-CMV-IKKα) were kindly provided by Jun Li (Boehringer Ingelheim). pFLAG-CMV-RIP, which expresses FLAG-tagged RIP protein, was generously provided by David Wallach (Weizmann Institute, Israel). The NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter construct (pIgκ-Luc) has been previously reported (35.Li Y. Kang J. Friedman J. Tarassishin L. Ye J. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. Horwitz M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using Monolight 2010 of The Analytical Luminescence Laboratory. Relative luciferase activity was normalized using β-galactosidase activity, which was expressed from the co-transfected pCH110. 293 cells were transfected with test plasmids and pGreen-Lantern-1, which served as a co-transfection marker facilitating the identification of transfected cells and monitoring transfection efficiency (50.Li Y. Horwitz M.S. Bio/Technology. 1997; 23: 1026-1029Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection cells were examined and photographed using a fluorescent microscope with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. The amount of apoptosis was measured by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using mouse antihistone and anti-DNA antibodies to detect mono- and oligonucleosomes. The fold increase of cell death in the experimental samples over control is taken as the apoptosis enrichment factor, which serves as an index of cell death. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, 293 cells were lysed with 1.5% Nonidet-P40, 0.25 m NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1x complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were precleared with normal mouse IgG and zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and then immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody or mouse monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody and zysorbin. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blotted with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 antibody or with nonconjugated anti-T7 antibody and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody. Western blots were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (NEN Life Science Products). 2 × 106 293 cells grown on 10-cm plates were transfected with 1.5 μg of FLAG-IKKβ and 3.0 μg of FIP3 by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell were treated with TNFα (20 ng/ml) for 15 min and then lysed. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and the immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with lysis buffer followed by kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; 20 mm β-glycerophosphate; 10 mmMgCl2; 100 μm Na3VO4; 2 mm dithiothreitol; and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The immunoprecipitates were then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 20 mm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 2 μg of GST-IκB-α-(1–53) or GST-IκB-α-(1–53) mutant with substitutions of serines at position 32 and 36 by alanines as substrates in the kinase buffer. The reaction mixtures were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gel was dried and developed by autoradiography. In parallel, the gel was subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-IKKβ antibody. The intensity of specific bands was quantified by densitometry. The 293 human embryonic kidney cell line was transfected with various FIP3 deletion mutants or vector alone as a negative control and FIP3 wild type as a positive control. One day post-transfection, the expression of FIP3 and various mutants was analyzed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.1 B, all FIP3 mutants were expressed in 293 cells with comparable molar levels. The mobility of some of them was irregular, probably because of differential post-translational modifications. FIP3 was initially cloned by its interaction with the adenovirus E3–14.7K protein in the yeast two-hybrid system (35.Li Y. Kang J. Friedman J. Tarassishin L. Ye J. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. Horwitz M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation studies were used to define the domains in FIP3, which mediate its interaction with the viral protein. Wild type FIP3 and amino-terminal deletion mutants ND100 and ND179 were all co-immunoprecipitated with the antibody against the FLAG-tag, which is on the 14.7K (Fig.2 A, lanes 2–4). ND200 was co-immunoprecipitated at a much lower efficiency (Fig.2 A, lane 5), whereas ND300 was not precipitated at all (lane 6). This suggested that amino acids 180–200 are required for full-scale FIP3–14.7K association and amino acids 201–300 are essential for the interaction to occur. The carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants did not co-precipitate with 14.7K (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7–10), arguing the last 100 amino acids are necessary for the interaction. We further tested the FIP3 mutants with deletions in the three leucine-zipper domains and the carboxyl-terminal zinc-finger domain in this interaction assay. Deletions of the carboxyl-terminal zinc-finger domain (amino acids 397–419) or the second leucine-zipper domain (amino acids 260–281) compromised the FIP3–14.7K interaction (Fig. 2 A,lanes 11 and 13), whereas the first and the third leucine-zipper domains are not important (Fig. 2 A,lanes 12 and 14). FLAG-tagged 14.7K protein was expressed well in all transfections (Fig. 2 B), and FIP3 mutants were all expressed at levels comparable to Fig. 1 B. From these studies, we concluded that the carboxyl-terminal half of the FIP3 protein is involved in the interaction between FIP3 and 14.7K, but the third leucine-zipper domain located in this region is not important. FIP3 is able to form dimers or trimers, and FIP3 also interacts with RIP (35.Li Y. Kang J. Friedman J. Tarassishin L. Ye J. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. Horwitz M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We used co-immunoprecipitation assays to map the region in FIP3 through which the FIP3-FIP3 association or FIP3-RIP interaction occurred. Wild type FIP3 associated with itself intermolecularly (Fig.3 A, lane 2) and interacted with RIP (Fig. 3 C, lane 2) as expected. Amino-terminal deletions of 100, 179, or 200 amino acids did not affect the FIP3-FIP3 association (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3–5), nor did they affect the FIP3-RIP interaction (Fig.3 C, lanes 3–5). Further deletion of 100 more amino acids abolished the FIP3-FIP3 and FIP3-RIP interaction (Fig. 3,A and C, lane 6). Carboxyl-terminal deletion of 100 amino acids did not change the FIP3-FIP3 or FIP3-RIP interaction either (Fig. 3, A and C, lane 7), whereas deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 200 amino acids or more abolished these interactions (Fig. 3, A andC, lanes 8–10). These data suggested that the 100-amino acid segment in the middle of the FIP3 protein is required for the FIP3-FIP3 or FIP3-RIP interaction. The FIP3 mutant with a deletion of the second leucine-zipper domain, which falls in this region (260–281), showed significantly weaker interaction with wild-type FIP3 (Fig. 3 A, lane 13) but did not affect FIP3-RIP interaction (Fig. 3 C, lane 13). Deletions of other leucine-zipper domains or the zinc-finger domain, which are outside of this region, did not affect the FIP3-FIP3 or FIP3-RIP interaction (Fig. 3, A and C,lanes 11, 12, and 14). The expression of FLAG-tagged wild type FIP3 and RIP are shown in Fig. 3, Band D, respectively, as controls. Also the expression of FIP3 mutants was monitored in these interaction studies by Western blot, and comparable expression levels were observed (data not shown). These co-immunoprecipitation analyses suggested that the region located between amino acids 201 and 300 is necessary for FIP3 self-association and for the FIP3-RIP interaction, and the second leucine-zipper domain, which covers the amino acids 260–281, is important but not absolutely required for FIP3 self-association. FIP3 is a key component of the IκB-α kinase complex; it interacts with IKKαin vivo (36.Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We mapped the FIP3 interaction with each of the IKK proteins to study whether FIP3 interacts with IKKα or IKKβ through the same or distinct regions. We used polyhistidine-tagged IKKα and FLAG-tagged IKKβ in the following co-immunoprecipitation studies. Wild type FIP3 interacted with IKKα (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) and IKKβ (Fig. 4 C, lane 2) as expected and is shown as positive controls. Amino-terminal deletions of 100 amino acids or more abolished the association between FIP3 and IKKα or IKKβ (Fig. 4, A and C, lanes 3–6), indicating that the first 100 amino acids are required for FIP3 to interact with IKKα or IKKβ. Carboxyl-terminal deletions of 100, 200, 240, or 300 amino acids did not affect the association of FIP3 and IKKα or IKKβ significantly (Fig. 4, A and C,lanes 7–10). These data suggested that these regions are not important for FIP3 to interact with IKKα or IKKβ and the amino-terminal 119 amino acids are necessary and sufficient for the FIP3-IKKα or FIP3-IKKβ interaction to occur properly. As anticipated from these results, none of the deletions in the leucine-zipper domains or in the zinc-finger domain compromised the FIP3-IKKα or FIP3-IKKβ interaction (Fig. 4, A andC, lanes 11–14). The expression of polyhistidine-tagged IKKα and FLAG-tagged IKKβ is shown in Fig. 4,B and D, as controls. FIP3 is an essential component of the NF-κB activation pathway (36.Yamaoka S. Courtois G.

When the amino-terminal 100, 179, or 200 amino acids were deleted, FIP3 retained its activity in down-regulation of NF-κB (Fig. 5, A–C, upper panels, columns 3–5), implying that the amino-terminal half of the protein is dispensable for its inhibitory effect on NF-κB. In agreement with this, deletion of the first leucine-zipper domain (amino acids 128–149) did not affect the inhibitory function of FIP3 (Fig. 5, A--C, upper panels,c"
https://openalex.org/W2161131510,"BS69 was first identified as a protein that interacts directly with the transactivation domain (conserved region 3) of the 289R adenovirus type 5 E1A protein. We show here that BS69 is a potent repressor of transcription. BS69 mediates repression, at least in part, through interaction with the co-repressor N-CoR. BS69 interacts with N-CoR through a MYND domain in its carboxyl terminus. A recently cloned splice variant of BS69, designated BRAM1, is also capable of interacting with N-CoR and E1A, but unlike BS69, is not able to repress transcription, indicating that N-CoR interaction is necessary but not sufficient for BS69 repression. Expression of E1A inhibits repression mediated by BS69. Our data suggest that BS69 participates in transcriptional repressor complexes and that E1A can modulate these complexes through interaction with BS69."
https://openalex.org/W2038087396,"Stromelysin-3 (ST3), a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expressed in aggressive carcinomas, has been shown to promote tumor development in different in vivo experimental models. However, the inability of its mature form to degrade extracellular matrix components casts doubt on whether ST3 functions in vivo as a protease. In this study, we evaluated whether the ST3 tumor-promoting effect could be ascribed to its proteolytic activity and whether this putative protease could be targeted with MMP inhibitors. Catalytically inactive mutant cDNA of human (h) ST3 or mouse (m) ST3 were generated and transfected into MCF7 cells. When injected into nude mice in the presence of matrigel, the mutant-bearing cells did not exhibit the enhanced tumorigenicity elicited by MCF7 cells transfected with wild-type ST3 cDNA. In a second approach, TIMP2 overproduction in MCF7 cells expressing hST3 was induced by retroviral infection. The co-expression of ST3 and TIMP2 failed to enhance the tumorigenicity of MCF7 cells. Notably, matrigel depleted of low-molecular-weight proteins and growth factors failed to promote the tumorigenicity of ST3-expressing MCF7 cells. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence that ST3 is indeed a protease that can modulate cancer progression by remodeling extracellular matrix and probably by inducing it to release the necessary microenvironmental factors. Thus, ST3 represents an interesting target for specific MMP inhibition."

Activation of sphingomyelinase, which generates ceramide, is an intermediate in cellular stress responses and induction of apoptosis in many systems. Conversely, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a critical signaling molecule involved in regulating cell survival and proliferation pathways. In the present study, we investigate cross-talk between the PI3K and sphingomyelinase pathways as a mechanism for regulation of cell survival/death decisions. We show that phorbol ester, insulin-like growth factor 1, and a constitutively active PI3K suppress both tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis and ceramide generation. Conversely, inhibition of the PI3K pathway with expression of a kinase-dead PI3K both prevented survival signaling and enhanced tumor necrosis factor-induced ceramide generation.

PI3K has emerged as a critical signaling molecule that regulates multiple cellular processes including survival and proliferation in numerous systems. PI3K is composed of a regulatory p85 subunit and a catalytic p110 subunit that as an active complex phosphorylate the 3-ring position of PI-4,5-bisphosphate to generate PI-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) (33.Coffer P.J.

PI3K activation of Akt/PKB and subsequent phosphorylation of Bad suggests one mechanism by which PI3K signaling acts to suppress apoptosis (45.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y.

Recently, ceramide has been shown to suppress Akt/PKB and its survival signaling suggesting cross-talk between these two pathways (33.Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 48.Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 49.Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Zhou H.

Based upon this information, we wished to examine both the ability of a PI3K signal to suppress apoptosis as well as the coordinate cross-regulation between the PI3K and ceramide pathways. The lipid second messenger ceramide is an important component of the cell stress response pathway and has been shown to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The effects of ceramide on numerous cellular processes is thought to be mediated through activation of a number of signaling molecules including, NF-κB, JNK, ceramide-activated protein kinase, and ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (4.Ip Y.T.

In addition to TNF, a variety of extracellular stimuli and agents of injury or stress including chemotherapeutic drugs, heat shock, oxidative stress, UV and ionizing radiation, as well as certain cytokines and hormones activate sphingomyelinase resulting in the generation of ceramide (4.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 5.Hannun Y.A.

TNF receptor-induced ceramide generation occurs primarily through the activation of neutral and acidic sphingomyelinases and, in the case of other apoptotic stimuli such as chemotherapeutic drugs, throughde novo synthesis via ceramide synthase (4.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 5.Hannun Y.A.

Ceramide levels within cells are regulated by a balance between its generation and metabolism through multiple enzymes including sphingomyelinases, ceramide synthase, ceramidases, ceramide kinase, sphingomyelin synthase, and glucosylceramide synthase (4.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 5.Hannun Y.A.

Additionally, recent reports have shown that phorbol ester-mediated inhibition of TNF-induced apoptosis and suppression of ceramide generation are partially mediated through activation of ceramidase (54.Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of ceramide generation within cells may depend on the specific sphingomyelinase activated, the magnitude and duration of signaling, as well as the existence of other pathways that may regulate the cell stress response. Here we demonstrate that manipulation of PI3K can determine the outcome of ceramide and TNF-induced cell death pathways in MCF-7 cells. Given the convincing role of ceramide in numerous cellular processes as a stress signal mediator and the role of PI3K in cell survival and proliferation decisions, we further investigated the role of PI3K in the regulation of ceramide levels. We show that PI3K is capable of regulating cellular ceramide levels induced by both TNF and exogenous SMase, demonstrating the existence of cross-talk between the PI3K and SMase pathways. Hoechst 33258, insulin, phorbol ester, and Bacillus cereus sphingomyelinase were obtained from Sigma. Human recombinant TNF and IGF-I were obtained from R & D Systems. X-Gal was obtained from Fisher. LY 294002 and C8-ceramide were obtained from Biomol. Cell culture reagents and LipofectAMINE were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. MCF-7 human breast epithelial cells were maintained in 10% DMEM (high glucose containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.)), 10−10m insulin (Sigma), basal minimum essential amino acids, minimum essential medium, amino acids, penicillin, streptomycin, and sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (55.Burow M.E. Weldon C. Tang Y. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Clejan S. Beckman B.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4940-4946PubMed Google Scholar). The constructs used were the constitutively activated PI3K (pCG-p110* (N-terminal myristoylation signal, Myc-tagged)) and the kinase-dead PI3K (pCG-p110*Δkin (N-terminally myristoylation signal, Myc-tagged)) which have been previously described (16.Kulik G.

The constitutively active Akt (CA-Akt) (AKT-RC25 (N-terminally myristoylated, HA-tagged)) has also been previously described (16.Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell.

MCF-7 cells were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid DNA per 1 × 106cells using the LipofectAMINE method according to manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6 h at which point the media were replaced with 10% DMEM for 48 h prior to experiments. Prior to experimentation the media were replaced with 0% DMEM, and the cells were treated accordingly. For fluorescent microscopy, cells were harvested and fixed in formalin, stained with bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258) (50 μg/ml), and visualized using an Olympus axioscope microscope using appropriate filters. For DNA fragmentation analysis, cells were harvested, and genomic DNA was isolated and run using gel electrophoresis as described previously (55.Burow M.E. Weldon C. Tang Y. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Clejan S. Beckman B.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4940-4946PubMed Google Scholar). Viability was determined as the percentage of viable cells per 500 cell counts as measured by trypan blue dye exclusion. For the crystal violet viability assay, MCF-7 cells were plated in 96-well plates at 1 × 104cells per well in 10% DMEM. The cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h at which point the media were removed, cells were washed in PBS, the media were replaced with 0% DMEM, and the cells were treated appropriately. Twenty four hours later the media were removed, and cells were stained with a 0.5% crystal violet solution for 10 min, washed with PBS to remove excess crystal violet, and lysed in a 0.1% SDS solution. Absorbance as 540 nm was measured using a 96-well microplate reader. Percent viability was determined based on 100% as representing untreated control cells. Decreased viability represents a decrease in percentage of staining as compared with 100% control values. For the β-galactosidase apoptosis assay (59.Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar), MCF-7 cells were transfected with 2 μg of either empty vector, p110*, or CA-Akt along with 1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase for 6 h using the LipofectAMINE method. Following this, media was replaced with 10% DMEM overnight. The next day the media were changed to 0% DMEM, and cells were treated with or without TNF (10 ng/ml). 24 h later cells were fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde in the treated medium for 15 min. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and incubated in β-galactosidase staining solution (20 mmK3Fe(CN)6, 20 mmK4Fe(CN)6, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml X-gal) overnight at 37 °C. The staining solution was removed, and the cells were visualized using a phase contrast microscope with percent cell death determined by counting the number of apoptotic (rounded blue) versus total transfected cells from three independent experiments. The β-galactosidase assay was also used to confirm transfection efficiency into MCF-7 cells. Ceramide was quantified by the diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase assay as 32P-incorporated upon phosphorylation of ceramide to ceramide 1-phosphate by DAG kinase as described previously (55.Burow M.E. Weldon C. Tang Y. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Clejan S. Beckman B.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4940-4946PubMed Google Scholar, 60.Clejan S. Dotson R.S. Wolf E.W. Corb M.P. Ide C.F. Exp. Cell.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2260-2264PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were treated with or without TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for the times indicated, washed in PBS, and fixed in ice-cold methanol. After extraction of the lipid, ceramide contained within the organic phase extract was resuspended in 20 μl of 7.5% α-octyl-β-glucopyranoside, 5 mmcardiolipin, 1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Sigma). Thereafter, 40 μl of purified DAG kinase in enzyme buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5m NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, and 15% glycerol, pH 7.4) was added to the organic phase extract. [γ-32P]ATP (20 μl 10 mm; 1000 dpm/pmol), in buffer, was added to start the reaction. After 30 min at 22 °C, the reaction was stopped by extraction of lipids with 1 ml of chloroform:methanol:hydrochloric acid (100:100:1, v/v). Buffered saline solution (170 μl; 135 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) and 30 μl of 100 mm EDTA were added. The lower organic phase was dried under N2. Ceramide 1-phosphate was resolved by TLC using CHCl3:CH3OH:acetic acid (65:15:5, v/v) as solvent and detected by autoradiography, and the incorporated32P was quantified by phosphorimaging (Fugi BAS1000, Fugi Medical Systems, USA). The level of ceramide was determined by comparison to a concomitantly run standard curve composed of known amounts of ceramide. During initial examination of ceramide generation by TNF treatment in MCF-7 cells, our laboratory measured ceramide levels by both DAG kinase assay and high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis. These studies were in agreement with the recent publication of Garzotto et al. (61.Garzotto M. White-Jones M. Jiang Y. Ehleiter D. Liao W.C. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2260-2264PubMed Google Scholar) which demonstrated a linear correlation between ceramide generation measured by high pressure liquid chromatography and DAG kinase assay. Analysis of Myc tagged-PI3K expression and poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage were assessed using Western blot analysis as described previously (55.Burow M.E. Weldon C. Tang"
https://openalex.org/W2319340548,"The stress-activated pathways leading to activation of p38 MAP kinase (p38 MAPK) and c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) have been shown to be activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, physical and chemical stresses as well as a variety of hematopoietic growth factors. One exception is interleukin (IL)-4, which does not activate this pathway in hematopoietic cell. We report here that in A431, a keratinocytic cell line, IL-4 activates Rac and Cdc42 and their downstream effector p21-activated kinase (PAK). Rac and Cdc42 appear to regulate a protein kinase cascade initiated at the level of PAK and leading to activation of p38 MAPK, since IL-4 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and increases its catalytic activity. As A431 cells are able to produce IL-6 in response to IL-4 stimulation, we assessed the involvement of p38 MAPK in IL-6 gene expression. A pyrimidazole compound, SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, inhibits production and gene expression of IL-6. SB203580 reduced significantly the stability of IL-6 mRNA. Here we provide evidence that p38 MAPK is activated in response to IL-4 and is involved in IL-6 synthesis by stabilizing IL-6 mRNA."

This AtNMT1 cDNA clone has an open reading frame of 434 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 48,706 Da. The primary structure is 50% identical to the mammalian NMTs. Analyses of Southern blots, genomic clones, and database sequences suggested that the A. thaliana genome contains two copies of NMT gene, which are present on different chromosomes and have distinct genomic organizations. The recombinant AtNMT1 expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited a high catalytic efficiency for the peptides derived from putative plant myristoylated proteins AtCDPK6 and Fen kinase. The AtNMT was similar to the mammalian NMTs with respect to a relative specificity for myristoyl CoA amoung the acyl CoA donors and also inhibition by the bovine brain NMT inhibitor NIP71. The AtNMT1 expression profile indicated ubiquity in roots, stem, leaves, flowers, and siliques (≈1.7 kb transcript and ≈50 kDa immunoreactive polypeptide) but a greater level in the younger tissue, which are developmentally very active. NMT activity was also evident in all these tissues. Subcellular distribution studies indicated that, in leaf extracts, ∼60% of AtNMT activity was associated with the ribosomal fractions, whereas ∼30% of the activity was observed in the cytosolic fractions. The NMT is biologically important to plants, as noted from the stunted development when the AtNMT1 was down-regulated in transgenic Arabidopsis under the control of an enhanced CaMV 35S promoter.

These observations imply that protein N-myristoylation may be involved in various plant processes. However, in vivo and in vitroevidence for the myristoylation of these proteins and its potential importance for their functions remain to be established in plants.NMT genes/proteins have been isolated and well characterized fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (8.Duronio R.J.

Multiple sequence alignment of all the known NMT genes revealed a high degree of similarity at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels, and more interestingly, the amino acid residues required for the catalytic activity are highly conserved. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies have shown that NMT is distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm of yeast and mammalian cells (30.Knoll L.J. Levy M.A. Stahl P.D. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

So far the only report on plant NMT has been from wheat germ in whichN-myristoylation was demonstrated in a cell-free translation system (10.Heuckeroth R.O. Towler A.D. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2127-2133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wheat germ enzyme showed a peptide substrate specificity that is broadly similar to yeast NMT, although with a different preference for the amino acid at the 5th position of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase-derived peptide substrate (GNAAAARR, Refs. 10.Heuckeroth R.O.

Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no detailed biochemical and molecular characterization of plant NMT or its potential importance in plant development or function has been reported. We describe here, for the first time, the cDNA cloning, genomic organization, molecular properties and biochemical characterization of NMT from a higher plant. Furthermore, our antisense transgenic studies withArabidopsis also show the importance of NMT for normal growth and development.DISCUSSIONN-Myristoylation of proteins is a co-translational event (3.Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 4.Wilcox C. Olson N.N. Science. 1987; 238: 1275-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 59.Towler D.A. Adams S.P.

Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 3.Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys.

The enzyme responsible for this modification, NMT, has been extensively studied in yeast and mammalian cells in the past decade, partly because NMT is a potential target for antiviral, antifungal, and antineoplastic therapy (1.Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 2.Bhatnagar R.S. Gordon L.I. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 7: 14-40Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, very little information is available about myristoylation in plants. We have now demonstrated NMT activity in Arabidopsis and characterized it further. Given the wealth of information accruing in Arabidopsis, this work provides an excellent means to study the functions of NMT in plants.A full-length cDNA isolated from Arabidopsis was confirmed to encode an NMT by its enzymatic activity in a heterologous expression system (Table I). The primary structure of AtNMT1 generally resembles that of mammalian NMTs in that it shows a high similarity with these NMTs and possesses almost all amino acid residues essential for catalytic activity. The hNMT antibody could recognizeArabidopsis NMT, further confirming its overall structural similarity. However, a sequence divergence has been observed in the amino-terminal non-catalytic region of these NMTs. This is consistent with the suggestion that the amino-terminal domains of NMTs have regulatory functions, thus necessitating species-specific requirements (33.Glover C.J. Hartman K.D. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28680-28689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 61.Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

Although the precise role remains to be defined, the amino terminus of NMT has been implicated in mediating protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions, which determine targeting to specific intracellular compartments and regulate co-substrate availability through associations with intracellular proteins (29.Ntwasa M. Egerton M. Gay N.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 149-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Knoll L.J. Levy M.A. Stahl P.D. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28680-28689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the role of the amino terminus of AtNMT1 remains to be defined.The predicted molecular mass of AtNMT1, 48,706 Da, is in good agreement with the E. coli-expressed recombinant protein (data not shown) and the leaf AtNMT1 (Fig. 6 C), which was estimated to be 50,000 Da. This is in general agreement with previous studies of other NMTs that gave molecular mass of 50–60 kDa for monomeric human (26.Duronio R.J. Reed S.I. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33.Glover C.J. Hartman K.D. Felsted R.L. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 1998; 241: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), 55 kDa for yeast (64.Towler D.A. Adams S.P. Eubanks S.R. Towery D.S. Jackson-Machelski E. Glaser L. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), 53 kDa for C. albicans (25.Wiegand R.C. Carr C. Minnerly J.C. Pauley A.M. Carron C.P. Langner C.A. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8591-8598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 46 kDa forDrosophila (29.Ntwasa M. Egerton M. Gay N.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 149-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, NMTs from murine leukemia cell line L1210 (65.Boutin J.A. Ferry G. Ernould A.P. Maes P. Remond G. Vincent M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 853-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and bovine brain (27.Glover C.J. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23226-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated to exist in multiple isoforms.The existence of two AtNMT genes in Arabidopsisadds to the complexity of AtNMT function in plants. Sequence analysis of two genomic clones (AtNMT1-G1 and -G2) revealed a perfect match with AtNMT1 cDNA, and database searches identified the second putative AtNMT2 genomic region from chromosome 2. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the only intron in AtNMT1-G1and G2 on chromosome 5 is located 3 bp upstream to the longest ORF of AtNMT1, whereas the single intron predicted in AtNMT2 gene on chromosome 2 is located in the protein coding region after the 100th amino acid. In addition, an alignment of these two sequences showed that the two proteins share 71% similarity with the most divergence in amino-terminal domains and displayed no similarity at all between positions 73 and 145 of AtNMT1 (Fig. 1). It should also be noted that the NMT signature sequences (KFGXGDG and (ED)(IV)NFLXHK) were not conserved in the putative AtNMT2, although it showed conservation in residues, such as Cys-169, His-293, and Gly-412 from human and bovine NMTs, which have been implicated in the catalytic activity (Fig. 1). These observations further indicated that Arabidopsis contains two potentialAtNMT genes with distinct genomic organization. These data suggest that AtNMT1 and AtNMt2 must have diverged early or the conservation shows a convergent evolution of related functions. In a separate study, we found two copies ofNMT-like genes in diploid and four copies in tetraploidBrassica species, 2C. Jiang, Q. Qi, G. Selvaraj, and R. Datla, unpublished results.consistent with the Arabidopsis results. The function of theAtNMT2 gene is unknown. A more precise investigation of the functional differences, if any, between the two AtNMT genes in Arabidopsis can be pursued when the full-lengthAtNMT2 cDNA is isolated. Interestingly, mammals also contain two NMT genes, human-NMT1 andNMT2 and mouse-NMT1 and NMT2 (56.Giang D.K. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6595-6598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Their genomic organization is complex. For example, hNMT1 is encoded by 11 exons of various lengths (66.Raju R.V.S. Datla R.S.S. Sharma R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as with AtNMTs, aa sequence divergence was most prevalent in the amino-terminal domains (67.Lodge J.K. Johnson R.L. Weinberg R.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2996-3009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).While the transcript, polypeptide, and enzyme activity of AtNMT were detected in all Arabidopsis tissues analyzed, the greater level in young roots, leaves, and siliques suggest a developmental regulation. However, a more precise investigation of spatial distribution of AtNMT expression is required for this conclusion. It should be noted that the transcripts and enzyme activity measured inArabidopsis tissues may come from both AtNMT1 and AtNMT2, because they are highly homologous and could utilize similar peptide substrates. However, the observed variation in polypeptide levels (Fig.6 C) only reflects the difference in level of AtNMT1 expression among these different stage tissues, since the anti-AtNMT1 peptide antibody used was produced based on the peptide from aa 114 to 129 of AtNMT1, which are completely absent in putative AtNMT2 aa sequence (Fig. 1). The human and bovine NMTs are also expressed in all the tissues tested, with variation in the levels of transcripts and activities (34.King M.J. Sharma R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 68.McIlhinney R.A. McGlone K. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, a higher level of NMT transcript occurs at early stages of embryogenesis (29.Ntwasa M. Egerton M. Gay N.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 149-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus there appears to be a developmental regulation of NMTs.AtNMT1 has similar biochemical properties with other eukaryotic NMTs in terms of optimum pH and fatty acid chain-length specificities. As shown in yeast (69.Towler D.A. Adams S.P. Eubanks S.R. Towery D.S. Jackson-Machelski E. Glaser L. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and human (70.McIlhinney R.A. Patel P.B. McGlone K Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) NMTs, the recombinant AtNMT1 had a high degree of specificity for myristoyl-CoA as acyl-CoA donor. The palmitoyl- and stearoyl-CoAs did not function as a substrate, whereas shorter chain (C10:0 and C12:0) acyl-CoAs donated their acyl chains at significantly reduced rate (25–40% of myristoyl-CoA). The AtNMT1 specificity for myristoyl-CoA (a less hydrophobic acyl chain in comparison with long chain fatty acids) is significant in light of the higher availability of other fatty acids in plant tissues, for example, the pool size of palmitic acid (C16:0) is ≈20 times that of myristic acid and more than 100 times that of decanoic and dodecanoic acids in Arabidopsis Columbia leaves, 3Q. Qi and R. Datla, unpublished results. and yet these do not function as the acyl donors. A similar inference has been made in other eukaryotes (3.Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). In vitro kinetic studies also revealed that the enzyme exhibited a great deal of specificity for its peptide substrate and recognized only those with the amino-terminal glycine residues (Table I). However, AtNMT1 has a large variation in its catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) for various peptide substrates (Table I), indicating preference among these peptides and suggesting that proper context in the polypeptide substrates (besides conserved glycine and serine residues at 2 and 6, respectively) may play an important role. Furthermore, comparison of the peptide substrate specificities of AtNMT1 and hNMT1 using synthetic peptides derived from the amino-terminal sequences of eight differentN-myristoyl proteins indicated that these two NMTs displayed significant differences in their catalytic efficiencies (V max/K m). For instance, the two peptides derived from M2 and myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate were utilized readily by hNMT1 but not for AtNMT1. Conversely, the two peptides derived from ArabidopsisAtCDPK6 and tomato Fen kinase were more efficiently myristoylated by AtNMT1 in comparison to hNMT1 (7–15-fold greater catalytic efficiency, see Table I). In general, the peptides derived from the putative plant N-myristoylated proteins gave a higher catalytic efficiency than those from the mammalian proteins. Similar comparative studies using NMTs from the yeast, rat liver, and wheat germ showed significant differences in terms of their respective peptide substrate specificity (10.Heuckeroth R.O.

Chem. 1988; 263: 1784-1790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DEM gene product of tomato plays an important role in meristem function, and it contains potential N-myristoylation signal (24.Keddie J.S. Carroll B.J. Thomas C.M. Reyes M.E. Klimyuk V. Holtan H. Gruissem W. Jones J.D.G. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However a peptide designed for it was not efficiently myristoylated by AtNMT1. This peptide contained a negatively charged (glutamic acid) residue at position 8, and this might have interfered with the modification as reported in other studies (61.Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9964-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 69.Towler D.A. Adams S.P. Eubanks S.R. Towery D.S. Jackson-Machelski E. Glaser L. Gordon J.I.

Biochem. 1994; 222: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Compared with the DEM, the peptide derived from tomato Fen kinase exhibited high catalytic efficiency with AtNMT1. These results suggest that Fen kinase is myristoylated in vivo and further support the proposed functional role for the amino-terminal Gly-2 residue of this enzyme (72.Rommens C.M. Salmeron J.M. Baulcombe D.C. Staskawicz B.J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 249-257PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of DNA and protein databases for potentialN-m"
https://openalex.org/W2326541300,"The Shc adaptor is responsible for coupling receptor tyrosine kinases and tyrosine kinase-associated receptors to the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Shc is believed to be regulated by a change in subcellular localization from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where it recruits Grb-2/Sos complexes and hence permits juxtaposition of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos to Ras, resulting in GDP/GTP exchange and Ras activation. Shc has been recently shown to inducibly colocalize in detergent-resistant membrane rafts together with the activated TCR and associated signaling molecules. To understand whether Shc localization in membrane rafts is sufficient to regulate Shc function, we constructed a Shc chimera containing the Ras membrane localization motif at the C-terminus. We show that membrane targeted Shc was constitutively localized in the plasma membrane of T-cells, and was mostly compartmentalized in lipid rafts. Membrane targeted Shc was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and bound Grb-2/Sos in the absence of TCR engagement. Furthermore, expression of membrane targeted Shc resulted in constitutive downstream signaling, including Erk2 activation and enhancement of TCR dependent activation of the TCR responsive transcription factor NF-AT. Hence localization of Shc in membrane rafts is sufficient for Shc to acquire a signaling competent state. Interestingly, a membrane targeted Shc mutant lacking both Grb-2 binding sites was not only incapable of signaling in the absence of TCR triggering, but transdominantly inhibited endogenous Shc, supporting a non redundant role for Shc in the activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway in T-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2066191517,"Cerebrovascular deposition of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) is a key pathologic lesion seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease and certain related disorders, including hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type (HCHWA-D). The deposition of Aβ has pronounced deleterious effects on smooth muscle cells within the cerebral vessel wall. We have previously shown that Aβ1–40 possessing the E22Q HCHWA-D mutation extensively assembles into fibrils on the surface of cultured human cerebrovascular smooth muscle (HCSM) cells. This cell-surface Aβ fibril formation induces a series of pathologic responses in cultured HCSM cells, including a marked increase in the levels of cell-associated amyloid β-protein precursor (AβPP) and cell death. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between HCSM cell-surface Aβ fibril formation and the striking increase in cell-associated AβPP. Time course studies showed that cell-surface HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 fibril formation occurred rapidly, whereas both the increase in cell-associated AβPP and loss of cell viability were delayed responses. Domain analysis using site-specific antibodies indicated that the vast majority of the increase in cell-associated AβPP was secreted AβPP (sAβPP). Localization studies showed that the sAβPP was present on the HCSM cell surface. This result raised the possibility that sAβPP may bind back to HCSM cell-surface fibrils formed by HCHWA-D Aβ1–40. Indeed, binding of biotinylated sAβPP to fibrillar HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, solid-phase binding assays showed that biotinylated sAβPP exhibited dose-dependent, saturable binding to fibrillar (but not soluble) HCHWA-D Aβ1–40with k d ≈ 28 nm. Exon deletion experiments further defined a fragment of sAβPP (AβPP18–119), encoded by AβPP exons 2 and 3, to contain the fibrillar Aβ-binding domain. In addition, AβPP18–119 effectively blocked the cell-surface accumulation of sAβPP and subsequent cell death in HCSM cells treated with pathogenic Aβ. Together, these findings could explain the accumulation of AβPP in cerebrovascular Aβ deposits observed bothin vitro and in vivo and may contribute to the pathologic responses evoked by pathogenic forms of Aβ in HCSM cells.

Aβ is a 39–43-amino acid peptide that is proteolytically derived from its larger parent molecule called the amyloid β-protein precursor (AβPP) (for recent review, see Ref. 8.Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Although AβPP exhibits a variety of biological activities, its role as the precursor molecule of the Aβ peptide has drawn the most interest to this protein (9.Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Gzreschik K.-H. Multhuap G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 4245-4269Crossref Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). In this regard, full-length AβPP can undergo proteolytic cleavage by a recently identified enzyme, termed β-site AβPP-cleaving enzyme, at the amino terminus of the Aβ domain (10.Vassar R. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Khan S. Mendiaz E.A. Denis P. Teplow D.B. Ross S. Amarante P. Leoloff R. Luo Y. Fisher S. Fuller J. Edenson S. Lile J. Jarosisnki M.A. Biere A.J. Curran E. Burgess T. Louis J. Collins F. Treanor J. Rogers G. Citron M. Science. 1999; 286: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar). Subsequent cleavage of the remaining amyloidogenic membrane-spanning AβPP carboxyl-terminal fragment by the enzyme γ-secretase liberates the Aβ peptide. Although the identity of γ-secretase remains unknown, recent studies suggest that the presenilin proteins may function as this enzyme or as a required cofactor for γ-secretase function (11.De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar, 12.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Alternatively, full-length AβPP can be proteolytically processed by another enzyme (α-secretase) at position 16 within the Aβ domain. This cleavage results in a non-amyloidogenic membrane-spanning carboxyl-terminal fragment and truncated secretory forms of AβPP (sAβPP) that are released into the extracellular environment. Cerebrovascular Aβ deposition seen in Alzheimer's disease and HCHWA-D patients is accompanied by smooth muscle cell degeneration, suggesting a toxic effect of Aβ on these cells in vivo(13.Coria F. Larrondo-Lillo M. Frangione B. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1989; 48: 368-375Crossref Google Scholar, 14.Kawai M. Kalaria R.N. Cras P. Seidlak S.L. Velasco M.E. Shelton E.R. Chan H.W. Greenberg B.D.

Invest. 1994; 1: 8-16Google Scholar). Additionally, the degenerating smooth muscle cells have been thought to contribute to the overproduction of AβPP and Aβ in cerebral blood vessels; this further implicates these cells as active participants in the progression of this cerebrovascular pathology (6.Wattendorf A.R. Frangione B. Luyendijk W. Bots G.T.A.M. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1995; 59: 699-705Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar,16.Okazaki H. Reagen T.J. Campbell R.J. Mayo Clin.

Similar to these in vivo findings, our laboratory has previously reported that certain forms of Aβ (e.g.wild-type Aβ1–42 and HCHWA-D Aβ1–40containing the E22Q mutation) cause severe cellular degeneration accompanied by a marked increase in the level of cell-associated AβPP in cultured human cerebrovascular smooth muscle (HCSM) cells (18.Van Nostrand W.E.

Sci. 1996; 777: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Non-fibrillar forms of these pathogenic Aβ peptides are needed to induce a toxic response to HCSM cells in culture. This observation was supported by studies demonstrating that assembly of these pathogenic Aβ peptides into β-sheet-containing fibrils in solution abolishes their cytotoxic properties in cultured HCSM cells (21.Davis-Salinas J. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20887-20890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, subsequent investigations revealed that the non-fibrillar pathogenic forms of Aβ assemble into an elaborate network of fibrils on the surfaces of HCSM cells and that these cell surface-assembled fibrils correlate with the pathologic responses in these cells (22.Van Nostrand W.E. Melchor J.P. Ruffini L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Together, these studies imply that the pathogenicity of Aβ to HCSM cells resides in its ability to form extensive fibrils on the surface of these cells. In this study, we further investigated the relationship between cell-surface Aβ fibril formation and the robust increase in cell-associated AβPP in HCSM cells. Here, we report that soluble, non-fibrillar HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 assembles into fibrils on the surface of HCSM cells prior to the increase in cell-associated AβPP and loss of cell viability. Further analyses indicated that the majority of the increase in cell-associated AβPP is due to sAβPP binding back to the Aβ fibrils formed on the HCSM cell surface. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies and solid-phase binding assays demonstrated that sAβPP binds to fibrillar Aβ in a saturable and dose-dependent manner. The Aβ25–35fragment, in fibrillar form, was sufficient to bind sAβPP. On the other hand, an amino-terminal fragment of AβPP encoded by exons 2 and 3 (AβPP18–119) contained the fibrillar Aβ-binding domain. Additionally, the AβPP18–119 fragment could block the pathologic responses of pathogenic Aβ in HCSM cells. The present findings suggest that this pathologic interaction between sAβPP and HCSM cell-surface Aβ fibrils could explain the accumulation of AβPP in cerebrovascular Aβ deposits observedin vivo and may contribute to additional pathologic responses evoked by pathogenic forms of Aβ in these cells. HCHWA-D Aβ1–40, wild-type Aβ1–42, and Aβ25–35 peptides were synthesized by solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acid chemistry, purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and structurally characterized as described previously (23.Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Cotman C.W. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lyophilized Aβ peptides were first resuspended in sterile distilled water to a concentration of 250 μm. The secondary structure of the resuspended peptides was determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy as described previously (22.Van Nostrand W.E. Melchor J.P. Ruffini L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Prior to addition to HCSM cells, the Aβ peptide was diluted to a final concentration of 25 μm in serum-free culture medium. sAβPP751 was purified as described previously (24.Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Suzuki M. Choi B.H. Farrow J.S. Geddes J.W. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. Nature. 1989; 341: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and was biotinylated using Pierce EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidobiotin according to the manufacturer's protocol. The anti-AβPP mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) P2-1, which specifically recognizes an epitope in the amino-terminal region of human AβPP, was prepared as described previously (24.Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Suzuki M. Choi B.H. Farrow J.S. Geddes J.W. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. Nature. 1989; 341: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The anti-Aβ mouse mAbs 6E10 and 4G8 were obtained from Senetek. The anti-AβPP rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) R1, specifically raised against the 21 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus of AβPP, was a generous gift from Dr. Nikolaos Robakis (Mount Sinai Medical School, New York, NY). The anti-β-tubulin mAb was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Thioflavin T was purchased from Sigma. The secondary peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse IgG and peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Supersignal Dura West chemiluminescence substrate was purchased from Pierce. Primary cultures of HCSM cells were established and characterized as described previously (18.Van Nostrand W.E. Rozemuller A.J.M. Chung R. Cotman C.W. Saporito-Irwin S.M. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1994; 1: 1-7Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The HCSM cells used in these studies were between passages 4 and 7 and were maintained in either 12- or 24-well tissue culture dishes with Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Calabasas, CA), nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.). For experiments, near-confluent cultures of HCSM cells were placed in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight prior to treatment. Freshly solubilized HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 at a final concentration of 25 μm was added to cultures in serum-free medium and incubated at 37 °C for the specified lengths of time. Cells were routinely viewed and photographed using an Olympus IX70 phase-contrast microscope. Cell viability was quantified using a fluorescent live/dead cell assay (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) following the manufacturer's protocol. The cultured HCSM cells were viewed using an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope, and the number of live and dead cells was counted from several fields (n = 4) from at least three separate wells for each experiment. For analysis of cell-surface HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 fibrils, HCSM cells were grown to near confluence on Transwell membranes (Corning Inc., Acton, MA). The cells were placed in serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA overnight and then incubated in the absence or presence of 25 μm HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 for 6 days. After incubation, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.2 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) three times, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and then rinsed again with PBS three times. The membranes were treated with 2% OsO4 for 20 min, washed extensively with distilled water, en bloc-stained with uranyl acetate, extensively rinsed with distilled water, and dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol rinses. The membranes were infiltrated with Spurr's resin, sliced into thin strips, flat-embedded, and cut into 90-μm sections. The sections were viewed with a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. For viewing the interaction between sAβPP and fibrillar Aβ, lyophilized HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 was resuspended at a concentration of 2.5 mm in sterile distilled water and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. The assembled Aβ fibrils were diluted to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and then added to carbon-Formvar 200-mesh copper grids. The grids were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with 1 μg/ml biotinylated sAβPP in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. The grids were rinsed several times with PBS and then incubated with a 1:20 dilution (in PBS) of 5-nm gold beads conjugated to streptavidin. The grids were washed with PBS, negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and viewed with a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. HCSM cells were grown to near confluence in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated in the absence or presence of freshly solubilized 25 μm HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 in serum-free medium for the specified lengths of time. The cells were then rinsed with PBS three times and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The HCSM cells were rinsed with PBS after fixation, stained with 0.1% thioflavin T (ThT) for 10 min at room temperature, and rinsed with 80% ethanol three times. 250 μl of PBS was added to each well, and ThT fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm and an emission wavelength of 485 nm using a Cytofluor II fluorometer (Perkin-Elmer). Each time point was performed in triplicate, and five fields were scanned for each well. Near-confluent cultures of HCSM cells were incubated in the absence or presence of HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 for the specified lengths of time. After incubation, the HCSM cells were rinsed with PBS three times, and the cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min to remove insoluble material. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were stored at −70 °C until analysis. Aliquots of the cell lysate samples were electrophoresed on nonreducing SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were electroblotted onto Hybond nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Unoccupied sites on the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk overnight in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma). The membranes were probed with mAb P2-1 (5 μg/ml), mAb 6E10 (diluted 1:1000), or mAb 4G8 (diluted 1:1000) and then incubated with the secondary peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. The peroxidase activity on the membranes was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system and analyzed using a Fluor-S Multi-Imager (Bio-Rad) with the manufacturer's Quantity One software. Alternatively, membranes were immunoblotted with the antibody against the AβPP carboxyl terminus (pAb R1) at 1:4000, followed by the secondary peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody at 1:1000. The peroxidase activity on the membranes was detected as described above. HCSM cells were grown to near confluence in 12-well tissue culture plates and incubated in the absence or presence of freshly solubilized 25 μmHCHWA-D Aβ1–40 in serum-free medium for 6 days. After this period, the HCSM cells were rinsed with PBS three times. To each well was added 50 μl of 0.05% trypsin in PBS with 1 mmEDTA, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The trypsin activity was inhibited by the addition of 350 μl/well 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). The cells were scraped from the wells, and the resulting suspension was spun at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to separate trypsin-digested cell-surface proteins from cytoplasmic proteins. The remaining cell pellets were solubilized in 400 μl of lysis buffer. The AβPP in the HCSM cell lysates was detected by immunoblotting using mAb P2-1 and quantitated using the Fluor-S Multi-Imager as described above. To examine for trypsin cleavage of intracellular proteins, β-tubulin degradation was used as a control and was detected by immunoblotting using the anti-β-tubulin mAb following the procedures described above. HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 was assembled into fibrils as described above. 50 ng of freshly solubilized or fibrillar HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 in 100 μl of PBS was dried down in a 96-well microtiter plate (Corning Inc.) overnight at 37 °C. The wells were rinsed with PBS three times and blocked with 100 μl/well PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing three times with PBS, increasing concentrations of biotinylated sAβPP in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA were incubated in triplicate (100 μl/well) for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing the wells with PBS three times, 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin horseradish peroxidase in PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA (1:800) was added for 1 h at room temperature. The binding of biotinylated sAβPP was detected using the colorimetric substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the substrate was diluted in buffer (0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.5) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 0.012% immediately before 100 μl of the substrate was added to each microtiter well. The solution was developed for ∼30 min at room temperature and quenched by the addition of 50 μl of 4 nH2SO4 solution to each well. The conversion of the colorimetric substrate was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm using a Molecular Dynamics Vmax kinetic plate reader. Alternatively, increasing concentrations of GST-AβPP18–119 (exons 2 and 3) were added to the wells, followed by an anti-GST mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:3000 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000). Bound secondary antibody was detected using the colorimetric substrate as described above. Human AβPP exons 2 and 3 were amplified from the AβPP770 cDNA using primers 5′-CTGGAGGTACCCACTGATAAT-3′ (top strand) and 5′-AACTAAGCAGCGGTAGCGAATCAC-3′ (bottom strand) and inserted into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Both the amplified pCR2.1-human AβPP exon 2–3 construct and the GST protein vector pGEX-KG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were excised withEcoRI, and human AβPP exons 2 and 3 were inserted in frame with the GST protein. After verifying the plasmid for proper orientation by restriction enzyme mapping, Escherichia coliBL21 cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with the pGEX-KG-human AβPP exon 2–3 fusion construct by the conventional heat shock technique. The transformants were plated on LB/agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 37 °C, and colonies were then picked. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thioglucoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to a final concentration of 1 mm for 4 h. The cells were harvested and lysed by freeze-thawing and sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and passed through a GST-Sepharose column (Pierce). The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of PBS and eluted with 1 bed volume of 10 mmglutathione and 50 mm Tris (Sigma). The concentration of the eluted GST-AβPP18–119 fusion protein was determined using the extinction coefficient of GST. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that incubation of cultured HCSM cells with 25 μm freshly solubilized HCHWA-D Aβ1–40results in several pathologic responses, including cellular degeneration, sharply increased levels of cell-associated AβPP, and induction of apoptosis (19.Davis-Salinas J.

Invest. 1999; 6: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These pathologic responses of cultured HCSM cells were correlated with the assembly of soluble HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 into an extensive network of cell-surface fibrils (Fig. 1). We also showed that blocking the formation of these fibrils on the cell surface using Congo red, an amyloid fibril-binding dye, abolishes the pathogenic effect of the peptide, thus preventing elevated cell-associated AβPP levels and cell death (22.Van Nostrand W.E. Melchor J.P. Ruffini L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This suggested a link between HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 fibril assembly on the HCSM cell surface and the pathologic accumulation of AβPP. Similarly, our previous in vivo studies showed that cerebral blood vessels with fibrillar Aβ deposits in HCHWA-D patients exhibit highly elevated amounts of AβPP (27.Rozemuller A.J.M. Roos R.A.C. Bots G.T.A.M. Kamphorst W. Eikelenbloom P. Van Nostrand W.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1449-1457PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the nature of the pathologic increase in cell-associated AβPP in cultured HCSM cells treated with HCHWA-D Aβ1–40. We examined the relationship between cell-surface HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 fibril formation and the observed pathologic effects on cultured HCSM cells. The cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 25 μm freshly solubilized HCHWA-D Aβ1–40peptide for defined time periods up to 9 days. Following the specific incubation periods, cell-surface fibril assembly was quantified using the dye ThT, which emits a fluorescent signal when bound to amyloid fibrils (28.Naiki H. Higuchi K.

As shown in Fig.2 A, HCSM cell-surface ThT fluorescence increased sharply and leveled off after 1 day of incubation with HCHWA-D Aβ1–40. This indicated that cell-surface HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 binding and fibril assembly were relatively rapid events. There was no change in the ThT fluorescence in the untreated HCSM cells throughout the 9-day incubation period. We next quantified the pathologic responses of increased cell-associated AβPP and cell death evoked by HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 incubation of HCSM cells. Fig. 2 Bshows an initial increase in the level of HCSM cell-associated AβPP after 3 days, which steadily increased with longer incubations with the peptide. Measurement of cell viability with a fluorescent live/dead cell assay showed a similar pattern, with appreciable HCSM cell death first evident around 3 days, but more pronounced at the later time points of 6 and 9 days after incubation with HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that soluble HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 rapidly forms cell-surface fibrils on cultured HCSM cells and that both the accompanying pathologic responses of increased cell-associated AβPP and loss of cell viability occur later, starting at around 3 days and steadily increasing through the 9-day incubation period. This suggests that cell-surface Aβ fibril formation is not immediately toxic to cultured HCSM cells and that increased cell-associated AβPP is better correlated with the loss of HCSM cell viability. Therefore, we further characterized the nature of the increase in cell-associated AβPP on cultured HCSM cells after incubation with HCHWA-D Aβ1–40. We next determined if the increased cell-associated AβPP in HCSM cells was the full-length or secreted form of the protein. To accomplish this, we performed immunoblot analyses using site-specific antibodies to AβPP in the HCSM cell lysates that accumulated after incubation with 25 μmHCHWA-D Aβ1–40 peptide for 6 days. The antibodies used and the specific epitope each antibody recognizes are shown in Fig.3. Quantitative immunoblotting with mAb P2-1, which recognizes an amino-terminal epitope on AβPP (24.Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Suzuki M. Choi B.H. Farrow J.S. Geddes J.W. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D.

As shown in Fig.4 A, there was a ≈19-fold increase in total AβPP in HCSM cells treated with HCHWA-D Aβ1–40 (bar 2) compared with untreated HCSM cells (bar 1), consistent with previously published results (19.Davis-Salinas J.

In budding yeast, the presence of Cdc6 protein is normally restricted to the G1 phase of the cell cycle, at least partly because of its proteolytic degradation in the late G1/early S phase. Here we show that a Cdc28-dependent mechanism targets p57 CDC6 for degradation in mitotic-arrested budding yeast cells. Consistent with this observation, Cdc6–7 and Cdc6–8 proteins, mutants lacking Cdc28 phosphorylation sites, are stabilized relative to wild-type Cdc6. Our data also suggest a correlation between the absence of Cdc28/Clb kinase activity and Cdc6 protein stabilization, because a drop in Cdc28/Clb-associated kinase activity allows mitotic-arrested cells to accumulate Cdc6 protein. Finally, we also show that cdc28temperature-sensitive G1 mutants accumulate Cdc6 protein because of a post-transcriptional mechanism.

This model first proposes the establishment of a state of competence for replication at origins, as soon as cells exit from mitosis, and then its activation for the initiation of DNA synthesis, during the G1-to-S phase transition. At the same time, these steps must somehow be linked to the precise control of cell cycle progression to prevent reduplication of the genome before passage through mitosis. This latter type of control appears to be integrated through modulation by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 activity (5.Broek D. Bartlett R. Crawford K. Nurse P. Nature. 1991; 349: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 6.Hayles J. Fisher D. Woolard A. Nurse P.

Biol. 1995; 5: 1257-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The state of competence means that a multisubunit protein complex must be formed at the origins of replication, the discrete sites at which DNA synthesis is initiated. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the sequence elements making up these origins have been well characterized (8.Newlon C.S. Theis J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These origins are bound throughout the cell cycle by a complex of six proteins called the origin recognition complex (ORC), which is required for the initiation of DNA replication (9.Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 10.Diffley J.F.X. Cocker J.H.

Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Although ORCs at origins are essential, the binding of additional factors is needed for the initiation of genome duplication, as shown by in vivo footprint pattern changes during the cell cycle (11.Diffley J.F.X. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). InS. cerevisiae a number of gene products have been identified that interact with some of the components of the ORC, participating in the assembly of the initiation complex, or prereplicative complex (pre-RC). These include Mcm proteins, Cdc45, Cdc7, and Dbf4, as well as Cdc6 (12.Dowell S.J. Romanowsky P. Diffley J.F.X. Science. 1994; 265: 1243-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 13.Liang C.

Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The formation of prereplicative complexes in budding yeast is dependent on Cdc6 (16.Cocker J.H. Piatti S. Santocanale C. Nasmyth K. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 1996; 379: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence has indicated that Cdc6 is rate-limiting for the initiation of DNA replication through its interaction with ORC (13.Liang C. Weinreich M. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The closest homolog of CDC6 in fission yeast,cdc18+, is also required for DNA replication (17.Kelly T.J. Martin G.S. Forsburg S.L. Stephen R.J. Russo A. Nurse P. Cell. 1993; 74: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Cdc18 protein levels vary during the cell cycle, peaking at G1/S like Cdc6 (18.Nishitani H. Nurse P. Cell. 1995; 83: 397-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 19.Piatti S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3788-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Additionally, the overexpression ofcdc18+ induces continuous DNA synthesis (18.Nishitani H. Nurse P. Cell. 1995; 83: 397-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 20.Muzi-Falconi M. Brown G.W. Kelly T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that this gene plays a key role in initiating DNA replication. In fission yeast a link between the cell cycle machinery and pre-RCs has emerged through the demonstration that Cdc18 interacts in vivo with Cdc2 (the fission yeast homolog of budding yeast Cdc28) and Orp2 (the fission yeast homolog of budding yeast Orc2) (21.Leatherwood J. López-Girona A. Russell P. Nature. 1996; 379: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Also, it has been shown that in budding yeast the Cdc6 protein when overexpressed interacts with Cdc28 (22.Elsasser S. Lou F. Wang B. Campbell J.L. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1723-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23.Piatti S. Böhm T. Cocker J. Diffley J.F.X. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1516-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The inactivation of Cdc28/B-cyclin kinase seems to be required for both the exit from mitosis and the resetting of chromatin for the subsequent S phase (6.Hayles J. Fisher D. Woolard A. Nurse P. Cell. 1994; 78: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 7.Dahmann C. Diffley J.F.X. Nasmyth K.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1257-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This resetting involves Mcm binding to chromatin in a hypophosphorylated state (24 and references therein) and Cdc6 being recruited to origins, an essential step for the formation of pre-RCs (15.Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 16.Cocker J.H. Piatti S. Santocanale C. Nasmyth K. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 1996; 379: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). At the same time, reformation of the prereplicative complex is actively inhibited by Cdc28/B-cyclins (7.Dahmann C. Diffley J.F.X. Nasmyth K.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1257-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Because B cyclins are required for both entry into the S phase and the inhibition of nuclear resetting, another round of replication cannot occur until B-cyclin/Cdc28 kinases have been destroyed in the subsequent mitosis (6.Hayles J. Fisher D. Woolard A. Nurse P. Cell. 1994; 78: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 7.Dahmann C. Diffley J.F.X. Nasmyth K.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1257-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been suggested that a Cdc2-mediated mechanism regulates Cdc18 degradation inSchizosaccharomyces pombe, preventing this fission yeast from entering a second round of DNA replication within the same cell cycle (25.Jallepalli P.V. Brown G.W. Muzi-Falconi M. Tien D. Kelly T.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2767-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26.López-Girona A. Mondesert O. Leatherwood J. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our work here addresses the mechanism regulating the degradation of the key DNA replication initiator Cdc6 protein in S. cerevisiaeat the G1-to-S phase boundary. We have previously shown that Cdc6 is ubiquitinated in vivo for degradation (27.Sánchez M.M. Calzada A. Bueno A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9092-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In accordance with published data (28.Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), our results indicate that Cdc4 and Cdc34 participate in Cdc6 proteolysis, suggesting that the initiator protein is phosphorylated for degradation through the proteasome. Consistent with this hypothesis, here we report data suggesting that the phosphorylation of Cdc6 by Clb/Cdc28 kinases stimulates Cdc6 proteolysis and therefore restricts the formation of pre-RCs to G1. In light of these results, we propose not only thatCDC6 acts to initiate DNA replication at the onset of the S phase but also that its degradation is one of the multiple CDK-mediated events that prevent the reinitiation of DNA replication within the same cell cycle, because in the absence of Cdc6 no pre-RCs are formed. All S. cerevisiae strains were derived from 15Dau, a MATa derivative of BF264-15D (29.Cole G.M. Stone D.E. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The temperature-sensitive and deletion mutants used werecdc6-1 leu2 ura3; cdc6::URA3 GAL1-10:CDC6(LEU2) ura3 leu2,cdc6::KANMX4 GAL1-10:CDC6(LEU2) ura3 leu2, cdc28-13 bar1 − ura3, cdc28-4 bar1 − ura3, cdc28-1N trp1 leu2 ura3 his3,(3X)GAL1-10:SIC1, cdc6-1 (3X)GAL1-10:SIC1, GAL1-10:CDC6,GAL1-10:cdc6-7,GAL1-10:cdc6-8, andcdc6::KANMX4 bar1 − ura3strain transformed with pHR70CDC6,pHR70cdc6-7, or pHR70cdc6-8. CDC6 mutants were constructed with an in vitromutagenesis kit from Bio-Rad, using a 5.5-kbBamHI-HindIII CDC6 genomic fragment cloned into a pTZ19R as template. cdc6-7 was constructed by mutating threonines 23, 39, 135, and 368 and serines 43, 354, and 372 to alanines, and cdc6-8 was constructed by also mutating threonine 7 to alanine. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used were: 5′-ATACCAATAGCTCCAACTAAGCGT-3′ (A7), 5′-GCTCCAGCAGCGCCTCCACGA-3′ (A23), 5′-ACAGATGTTGCACCAGAATCA-3′ (A39), 5′-CCAGAATCAGCCCCAGAAAAACTG-3′ (A43), 5′-TCGCTCTCCGCGCCACGCTCG-3′ (A135), 5′-GGTTTCTGCTTGCACCAACAAGA-3′ (A354), 5′-GTTCCTTTGGCGCCAACTACT-3′ (A368), 5′-CCAACTACTGCTCCGGTAAAG-3′ (A372), and 5′-GGCACTGGCGAGACTGCC-3′ (E114). The underlined nucleotides are the mutated ones. pHR70CDC6, pHR70cdc6-7, and pHR70cdc6-8 plasmids were constructed by inserting the 5.5-kb BamHI-HindIII fragments from the pTZ19RCDC6, pTZ19Rcdc6-7, and pTZ19Rcdc6-8 into pHR70, a centromeric vector. To construct the integrative vectors YIpG3cdc6-7 and YIpG3cdc6-8, the cdc6-7 and cdc6-8open reading frames were amplified by PCR as described previously (30.Bueno A. Russell P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2167-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), using pTZ19Rcdc6-7 as template and a high-fidelity polymerase (Pwo polymerase from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All plasmids were sequenced using the dideoxy nucleotide method (31.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) to check that the desired nucleotides were actually mutated. TheCDC6HA construct was made by inserting anNdeI-NotI CDC6 fragment amplified by PCR under the conditions described elsewhere (32.Sadhu K. Reed S.I. Richardson H. Russell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5139-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) into the pREP1cdc2HA vector (33.Millar J. McGowan C. Lenaers G. Jones R. Russell P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4301-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), cut withNdeI-NotI to remove the cdc2+ gene. The 33-mer 5′ oligonucleotide used for this PCR had the following sequence: 5′-CGGATCCATATGTCAGCTATACCAATAACTCCA-3′, where the underlined sequence contains a BamHI and anNdeI site and the 3′ proximal 24 nucleotides correspond to the beginning of the CDC6 open reading frame. The 28-mer 3′ oligonucleotide had the sequence 5′-TGCGGCCGCGGTGAAGGAAAGGTTTCAA-3′. The underlined sequence contains a NotI site, and the reverse complement of the 3′ proximal 19 nucleotides corresponds to the 3′ end of theCDC6 open reading frame, without the stop codon. TheCDC6HA was removed from this plasmid by digesting withMunI and BamHI and was cloned into anEcoRI-BamHI-digested vector YIpG3, which had lost the GAL1 promotor. From the resulting YIpCDC6HAplasmid, a PstI fragment containing CDC6HA and the 0.2-kb 5′ region of URA3 was inserted into PstI-cut YIpG3CDC6 to place the tagged gene under the GAL1promotor. YIpCDC6HA was integrated at the CDC6locus by transforming wild-type cells with XbaI-digested plasmid to replace the wild-type CDC6 gene with the tagged version. The construction was checked to be in single copy integrated at the CDC6 locus by Southern analysis, digesting genomic DNA with EcoRI, XbaI, XhoI, orPstI, and probing with a PstI-XbaI fragment internal to CDC6. YIpG3CDC6, YIpG3cdc6-7, and YIpG3cdc6-8 integrative transformations in S. cerevisiae were targeted into the URA3 locus and also tested by Southern blot. Cells were grown in YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% glucose) except when selecting for plasmids. In this case, cultures were grown in minimal media with supplemented amino acids. General molecular techniques were performed as described (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 35.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-933PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA content of individual cells was measured using a Becton Dickinson FACScan. Cells were prepared for flow cytometry, using the method of Hutter and Eipel (36.Hutter K.J. Eipel H.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 113: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), by staining them with propidium iodide. Yeast cells were grown in YEP supplemented with 2% raffinose (YEPR) at 32 °C until the culture reached the midlog phase. Then, galactose was added to a final concentration of 2.5%. When temperature-sensitive strains were used, cells were grown at 25 °C. Cultures were incubated with shaking in the presence of nocodazole (15 μg/ml). Cells were further incubated and collected for fluorescence-activated cell sorting and microscopical analysis. Soluble protein extracts were prepared as described previously (37.Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194 (723): 795Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). Cells were collected, washed, and broken in 30 μl of histone buffer using glass beads. The HB buffer contained 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 25 mm4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (pH 7.2), 15 mmMgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin. The glass beads were washed with 500 μl of histone buffer, and the supernatant was recovered. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA assay kit (Pierce). Protein extracts and immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed using 10 or 8–16% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (38.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). For Western blots, 40 μg of total protein extracts from each sample were blotted onto nitrocellulose, and proteins were detected using a previously characterized anti-Cdc6 affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (1:500; Ref. 27.Sánchez M.M. Calzada A. Bueno A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9092-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the CDC6 (yN-19) affinity-purified goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000), the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 1:500), or the anti-Cdc28 polyclonal antibody (1:5000; Ref. 39.Lanker S. Valdivieso M.H. Wittenberg C. Science. 1996; 271: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-goat, or anti-mouse antibodies and the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. Total p34 CDC28 protein kinase activity was assayed after immunoprecipitation with anti-Cdc28 or with 12CA5 antibody, using histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as substrate (37.Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194 (723): 795Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). p34 CDC28 was immunoprecipitated from 0.8 mg of soluble protein extracts with 0.5 μl of polyclonal anti-Cdc28 antibodies (39.Lanker S. Valdivieso M.H. Wittenberg C. Science. 1996; 271: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Cdc6Ha was immunoprecipitated from 1.6 mg of soluble extract with 1.5 μg of 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoprecipitates were incubated in a 0.1 mm ATP, 0.5 mg/ml histone H1, and 20 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP reaction mix at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped with 1 × final Laemmli-SDS sample buffer and denatured for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Phosphorylated histone H1 was detected by autoradiography and quantitated using a Fujifilm BAS1200 PhosphorImager. A direct interaction between recombinant Cdc6 and ORC has been described (13.Liang C. Weinreich M. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). More recent biochemical evidence suggests that, when overexpressed, Cdc18, a Cdc6-like protein in fission yeast, interactsin vivo with p34 cdc2/CDC28 and Orp2, a putative component of the S. pombe ORC (21.Leatherwood J. López-Girona A. Russell P. Nature. 1996; 379: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In fact, also in budding yeast, it has been shown that Cdc6 interacts in vivo with Cdc28, at least under overexpressing conditions (22.Elsasser S. Lou F. Wang B. Campbell J.L. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1723-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23.Piatti S. Böhm T. Cocker J. Diffley J.F.X. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1516-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To testin vivo interactions between Cdc6 and Cdc28, we constructed a series of S. cerevisiae strains carrying a single copy of Ha-tagged CDC6 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Gene replacement experiments revealed that Cdc6Ha was fully functional (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation from Cdc6Ha-expressing cells with Ha monoclonal antibody coprecipitated H1 kinase activity (Fig.1 A). A cdc28-13 CDC6HA double mutant strain was also constructed. The kinase activity co-immunoprecipitated from this double mutant was thermosensitive in an in vitro assay, indicating that Cdc28 was physically interacting with Cdc6Ha (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, we detected p34 CDC28 in Cdc6Ha immunoprecipitates from those strains by Western analysis (Fig. 1 A). These results suggest that Cdc6 interacts in vivo with Cdc28 inS. cerevisiae cells under physiological conditions. The above biochemical interaction suggested that Cdc6 could be an in vivosubstrate for Cdc28 kinase, indicating the possibility that Cdc6 function or stability may be regulated by Cdc28 phosphorylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been shown that Cdc6 is anin vivo phosphoprotein (22.Elsasser S. Lou F. Wang B. Campbell J.L. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1723-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and that bacterially produced Cdc6 is an in vitro substrate for Clb-associated Cdc28 activity (Refs. 22.Elsasser S. Lou F. Wang B. Campbell J.L. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1723-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23.Piatti S. Böhm T. Cocker J. Diffley J.F.X. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1516-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, this work, and Fig. 1 B). We therefore evaluated Cdc6 stabilization in cells deficient in p34 CDC28 -associated kinase activity by Western analysis. Using a previously characterized rabbit polyclonal antibody (27.Sánchez M.M. Calzada A. Bueno A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9092-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) we examined the rate of Cdc6 disappearance in promoter shut off experiments in acdc28-13 GAL1-10:CDC6 strain. CDC6 expression was induced in nocodazole-arrested cells by incubating them in galactose for 60 min at 37 °C. Transcription was repressed by the addition of glucose, and Cdc6 stability was estimated by Western blotting at both 25 °C (permissive temperature) and 37 °C (restrictive temperature) (Fig. 2). Whereas Cdc6 became rapidly unstable at the permissive temperature or in a wild-type control at both temperatures, its levels remained constant up to 45 min at the restrictive temperature for cdc28-13. Comparable results were obtained when cycloheximide was added to inhibit protein synthesis at the same time that transcription was repressed with glucose (data not shown); nevertheless, Cdc6 protein was barely detectable after releasing the cells at the permissive temperature, as shown for CDC28 wild-type cells (Fig.3 C, upper panel). These results strongly suggest that cells blocked in mitosis require Cdc28 to degrade ectopically produced Cdc6.Figure 3Cdc6-7 and Cdc6-8 mutant proteins are more stable than wild-type Cdc6 protein. A, schematic drawing of the strategy used in the experiment shown in C. B, immunoblot detection of the Cdc6, Cdc6-7, and Cdc6-8 proteins. Protein extracts prepared from cells deleted forCDC6 (lane 1) or asynchronous cultures of cells overexpressing, from the GAL1-10 promoter, wild-typeCDC6 (lane 2), cdc6-7 (lane 3), or cdc6-8 (lane 4) were analyzed by immunoblotting with affinity-purified goat antiserum to Cdc6 (yN-19) or rabbit antiserum to Cdc28 for loading control. C, Analysis of the relative stability of Cdc6 phosphorylation site mutants. Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts from GAL1-10:CDC6, GAL1-10:cdc6-7, and GAL1–10:cdc6-8 strains is shown. The three mutant strains were blocked with nocodazole at 30 °C (NZ), and galactose was added for CDC6 induction during 60 min. Afterwards, GAL1-10 expression was repressed by addition of glucose (0′) as well as protein synthesis inhibited by adding cycloheximide (CH; 20 μg/ml). Samples were taken at indicated intervals, processed for Western blotting, and probed with affinity-purified goat antiserum to Cdc6 or rabbit antiserum to Cdc28.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We reasoned that if mitotic-arrested cells required a functional Cdc28 kinase to degrade Cdc6, it is conceivable that p57 CDC6 may be targeted for degradation by p34 CDC28 phosphorylation. If this were the case, it could be predicted that mutant forms of Cdc6 protein lacking its phosphorylation sites would be more stable than wild-type protein. Cdc6 contains eight Cdc28 consensus phosphorylation sites, three of them minimal ((S/T)P). The rest conform to full Cdc28 consensus sites ((S/T)PX(K/R)). We therefore constructed a number of mutants bearing different combinations of changes involving replacement of phosphoacceptor amino acids by alanines. We analyzed two mutant forms; one of them, named cdc6-7, carries alanine substitutions of Thr-23, Thr-39, Ser-43, Thr-135, Ser-354, Thr-368, and Ser-372. In the other we changed all phosphorylatable serines or threonines at putative Cdc28 phosphorylation sites by alanines. We called this version of the gene cdc6-8. Our additional approach to understand whether Cdc28 controls Cdc6 stability was to examine the rate of Cdc6 disappearance in promoter shut off experiments in a GAL1-10:CDC6 strain compared with Cdc6-7 and Cdc6-8 relative stability in GAL1-10:cdc6-7 or inGAL1-10:cdc6-8 strains, respectively. Similar to the experiment described in Fig. 2, CDC28 wild-typeGAL1-10:CDC6, CDC28 GAL1-10:cdc6-7, orCDC28 GAL1-10:cdc6-8 cells were blocked in nocodazole for 2.5 h at 30 °C. Flow cytometry and microscopic analysis demonstrated that cells were arrested in G2/M (data not shown). Expression of wild-type CDC6 or mutant formscdc6-7 and cdc6-8 was induced 60 min by addition of galactose. Transcription was repressed by adding glucose. At the same time, and in addition to the GAL1-10 promoter shut off, cycloheximide was added to ensure that no new synthesis of the endogenous Cdc6 was taking place. The stability of the different forms of Cdc6 was tested by Western blot in samples taken at indicated intervals in Fig. 3, A and C. Whereas wild-type Cdc6 protein become rapidly unstable, being barely detectable 15 min after blocking transcription and translation (Fig. 3 C, upper panel), both Cdc6-7 and Cdc6-8 mutant proteins remained stable for up to 2 h in these nocodazole-arrested cells (Fig. 3 C, middle and lower panels). From these experiments we conclude that the elimination of putative in vivo sites for phosphorylation in Cdc6-7 and Cdc6-8 results in the stabilization of Cdc6 protein. To test whether CDC6 mutants were functional, a complementation study was carried out on a cdc6-1 strain background. All mutants alleles were placed under the control of the CDC6wild-type promoter, which allowed us to perform a functional analysis. As a negative control, we constructed a mutant in which we changed the critical lysine at amino acid 114 to a glutamate in the unique match to the P-loop of the consensus purine nucleotide-binding motif (GXXGXGKT, at amino acids 108–115) present in Cdc6. We called this mutant cdc6-E114. Cells bearing this temperature-sensitive allele were transformed with four different centromeric plasmids (pHR70) having no insert or containingCDC6, cdc6-7, or cdc6-8, all of them under the control of the CDC6 wild-type promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). Transformants capable of growing on selective media at 25 °C were replica-plated and further tested for growth at 37 °C. All mutant alleles efficiently rescuedcdc6-1 (Fig. 4). We did not observe any differences in the complementation test between mutants and wild-type CDC6. In similar experiments, cdc6-E114 was unable to rescue the temperature-sensitive defect associated withcdc6-1 (data not shown), indicating that the purine nucleotide-binding motif is essential for CDC6 functionin vivo. Because the rescue of the cdc6-1temperature-sensitive (ts) allele does not necessarily mean that Cdc6-7 or Cdc6-8 are functional because, for instance, they could serve to stabilize the ts protein, we set up a complementation test of a null allele of cdc6 with these cdc6phosphorylation site mutants (Fig. 4). A cdc6deletion strain (cdc6::KANMX4), carrying aGAL1-10:CDC6 allele at the URA3 locus that supports growth in galactose-based media, was transformed with high multicopy plasmids (YEp13) bearing wild-type CDC6,cdc6-7, or cdc6-8 under the control of theCDC6 wild-type promoter. To test the ability of these plasmids to complement the null mutation, GAL1-10:CDC6 cells were changed to glucose medium to repress GAL1-10:CDC6expression. All mutants rescued the deletion of CDC6. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that, in consonance with a delay in G2, YEp13cdc6-7 transformants formed colonies of elongated cells. These results indicate that both Cdc6-7 and Cdc6-8 proteins are functional. It is already known thatde novo synthesis of Cdc6 protein is required for cells to enter the S phase (19.Piatti S.

Both of the two MSI-H tumors were glioblastomas which developed in teenage patients. One of the patient was diagnosed as having Turcot's syndrome and had a germline mutation in the hMLH1 gene. Loss of expression due to promoter methylation was selectively observed in the wild type allele of the hMLH1 gene in the tumor of this patient. The other patient had neither a family history nor a past personal history of malignancy. Although no mutation in the mismatch repair genes was detected in the tumor of this patient, the level of expression of the hMLH1 gene was markedly decreased and the promoter sequence of the gene was highly methylated. In the tumor of this patient, the PTEN1 gene, one of the genes carrying microsatellite sequences in their coding regions, was altered by a slippage mutation within five adenine repeat sequences. These findings indicate that the genetic or epigenentic inactivation of the hMLH1 gene is involved in a subset of early-onset gliomas and the PTEN1 gene could be a downstream target for mutation as observed in glioblastoma without MSI."

Although this leukotriene plays an important biological role, its intracellular signaling pathways are only partly known.

In the present study, we further examined these signaling events and found that LTD4induced a rapid interaction between Gβγ subunits and PLC-γ1; results obtained with GST fusion proteins of PLC-γ1 suggest that this interaction is mediated via the pleckstrin homology domain of PLC-γ1. Moreover, LTD4 induced an increased association of c-Src with PLC-γ1, and the selective Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP1 blocked both LTD4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and the association of PLC-γ1 with Gβγ subunits. The relevance of these observations in intracellular calcium signaling was investigated by microinjecting cells with anti-Gβ, anti-PLC-γ1, or anti-c-Src antibodies and by pretreatment with PP1. LTD4-induced calcium mobilization was blocked by each of the indicated antibodies (but not isotype-matched control antibodies) and by PP1.

Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) also noted that the LTB4 receptor, which belongs to the seven-transmembrane-spanning receptor group, can bind to two different G-proteins, one that is sensitive and one that is insensitive to pertussis toxin. The former G-protein has been identified as αi and the latter as α16, and both appear to signal via phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) in COS-7 cells (6.Gaudreau R. Le Gouill C. Metaoui S. Lemire S.

Sjölander A Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to a seven-transmembrane-spanning receptor triggers an increased dissociation of heterotrimeric G-proteins into free Gα and Gβγ subunits, which in turn transduce external signals to intracellular responses by interacting with downstream effectors. However, it is well established that a certain degree of receptor-independent dissociation into free Gα and Gβγ subunits occurs within cells (13.Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), and both of these subunits can separately regulate a variety of ion channels and intracellular enzymes, including different isoforms of PLC (13.Clapham D.E.

However, there are no reports of a direct association in vivo between Gβγ and PLC-γ or PLC-δ. Rhee and Bae (21.Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) originally described the PLC-γ isoform as a calcium signaling enzyme involved in growth factor signal transduction, and these investigators noted that activation of PLC-γ was associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation of this enzyme to the plasma membrane (21.Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Although we have found that LTD4 activated the heterotrimeric Gαi3-protein (22.Adolfsson J.L.P Öhd J.F. Sjölander A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we have also observed that LTD4 stimulated PLC-γ1, detected as an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation of this isoform of the enzyme to the plasma membrane (23.Grönroos E. Andersson T. Schippert Å. Zheng L. Sjölander A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the latter investigation, we noted that the PLC-γ1-mediated release of intracellular calcium in Int 407 cells included a Rho-dependent event. A similar role for Rho in PLC-γ-mediated calcium signaling was subsequently confirmed in other cells and for other types of receptors (24.Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Schreiber A. Zhang W.J.

In a subsequent study (27.Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Schieffer E. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol.

Later, the same research group (28.Venema R.C. Ju H. Venema V.J. Schieffer B. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol.

The following findings provided the incentive for the present investigation. Gβγ subunits reside in the plasma membrane; activation of PLC-γ1 is associated with translocation to the plasma membrane (21.Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar); Gβγ subunits interact and activate PLC-β2 in vitro (16.Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A.

Our aim was to investigate a possible role for Gβγ subunits in the LTD4-induced, PLC-γ1-dependent mobilization of calcium in the human intestinal epithelial cell line Int 407. The cDNAs for the PLC-γ PH(N)-SH2-SH2-SH3-PH(C) domain and the PLC-γ SH2-SH2-SH3 domain were kindly provided by Dr. Sue Goo Rhee (Laboratory of Cell Signaling, NIH, Bethesda, MD) and Dr. Carl-Henrik Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden), respectively (30.Bae Y.S.

The anti-Gβ, anti-PLC-γ1, and anti-c-Src antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY, and the anti-Src (Tyr418(P)) was from BIOSOURCEInternational, Camarillo, CA. LTD4 was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI, and fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma. Human embryonic intestinal epithelial cells (intestine 407 (31.Henle G. Deinhardt F J. Immunol. 1957; 79: 54-59PubMed Google Scholar)), which exhibit typical epithelial morphology and growth, were cultured as a monolayer to approximately 80% confluence for 5 days. Cell cultures were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in Eagle's basal medium supplemented with 15% newborn calf serum, 55 international units/ml penicillin and 55 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were regularly tested to ensure the absence of mycoplasma contamination. Cell stimulations (15 or 300 s) were terminated by adding ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Na-HEPES (pH 8), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 30 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Thereafter, the cells were scraped loose into the buffer and homogenized 10 times on ice and then centrifuged at 200 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, and after measurement of and compensation for the protein content, it was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The 1000 ×g supernatant was further centrifuged at 200,000 ×g for 30 min, and the resulting membrane-rich pellet was then washed and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for another 30 min. The particulate (membrane) fractions were resuspended in 500 μl of the described lysis buffer. The membrane and supernatant (cytosol) fractions were enzymatically characterized by measuring the presence of 5′-nucleotidase and lactate dehydrogenase; the activity of the membrane marker in the supernatant was negligible, and the cytosol marker showed no activity in the membrane fraction. The solubilized membrane fractions (23.Grönroos E. Andersson T. Schippert Å. Zheng L. Sjölander A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-PLC-γ1, 3.5 μg of anti-c-Src, or 3 μg of anti-Gβ antibodies. In the control experiments, the membrane fractions were incubated with isotype-matched antibodies directed against unrelated proteins or obtained from nonimmunized animals. The membrane fractions were subsequently incubated with gentle rocking for an additional hour at 4 °C with 100 μl of a 60 mg/ml solution of protein A- or 50 μl of 3 mg/ml solution of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed in buffer A (23.Grönroos E. Andersson T. Schippert Å. Zheng L. Sjölander A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% Tween 20. The cDNA clones encoding the GST fusion proteins of the PLC-γ1 PH(N)-SH2-SH2-SH3-PH(C) domain (amino acids 483 to 936) and the PLC-γ1 SH2-SH2-SH3 domain (amino acids 550 to 850) in pGEX vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli and cultured at 30 °C. Expression of the GST fusion proteins was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were subsequently collected by centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 15 min and sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline. Triton X-100 was added to the lysate (final concentration 1%), and particulates were removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 ×g (30.Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.-S. Kim S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The clarified lysate was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C and then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Thereafter, the bound protein was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCL (pH 8.0) and concentrated using a Centricon-10 (Amicon). For analysis of proteins binding to the GST fusion proteins, lysates of LTD4-stimulated or unstimulated cells were prepared in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (25 mmTris-HCL (pH 7.6), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3Vo4, 60 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). GST fusion proteins (5–10 μg) or GST alone were prebound to agarose beads and then incubated with 1.0 ml of the different cell lysates (1 mg/ml of proteins) for 2 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, the beads were washed with an ice-cold lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl. The precipitated proteins were solubilized by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min in 62 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 1.0% SDS, 10% glycerol, 15 mg/ml dithiothreitol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue (23.Grönroos E. Andersson T. Schippert Å. Zheng L. Sjölander A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All samples were then subjected to electrophoresis in the presence of SDS on 10% homogeneous polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and the membrane was then blocked overnight at 4 °C with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and subsequently incubated with a primary antibody for 1 h at 20 °C (diluting 1:1000 for anti-Gβ, 1:200 for anti-c-Src, and 1:250 for anti-PLC-γ1). The membrane was then washed extensively and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody for 1 h at 20 °C (dilution 1:10,000). Thereafter, the membrane was again washed extensively, incubated with ECL Western blot detection reagents, and finally exposed to hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to visualize immunoreactive proteins. An antiserum specific for Tyr418-phosphorylated Src was used to detect autophosphorylation of endogenous c-Src (32.Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The proteins in clarified whole-cell lysates of unstimulated and LTD4-stimulated cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The presence of Src proteins with a phosphorylated Tyr418 residue was detected using an anti-Tyr418-Src antibody (dilution 1:500) and a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (dilution 1:5000). The cells were incubated with 4 μmfura-2/AM in culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C (10.Sjölander A. Grönroos E. Hammarström S. Andersson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20976-20981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After fura-2 loading, the cells were microinjected with antibodies against Gβ, PLC-γ1, or c-Src or with an isotyped control antibody using an Eppendorf micromanipulator 5171/transjector at an injection pressure of 150–200 hectopascals and an injection time of 0.7 s. The antibody solutions were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3, 100–200 μg/ml) and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 10 min. The microinjected cells were allowed to rest for 15 min before beginning calcium measurement. The calcium signal was detected using a system consisting of a NIKON Diaphot microscope connected to a Photon Technology International (PTI) imaging system. Images of cells before and after stimulation with LTD4 were acquired using an excitation wavelength rapidly alternating between 340 and 380 nm while recording the emission at 510 nm. The fluorescence intensity ratios (340/380 nm) of the images were subsequently analyzed using PTI Image Master Software. To investigate a possible agonist-induced association of PLC-γ1 with Gβγ subunits in the Int 407 cells, anti-PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitates from membrane fractions were immunoblotted with Gβ antibodies. LTD4 induced increased interaction between Gβγ and PLC-γ1 that was detected after only 15 s (Fig. 1). To determine whether c-Src is involved in the activation of PLC-γ, as has been demonstrated in other cell types as well as in vitro (27.Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Schieffer E.

For both Gβγ and c-Src, the association with PLC-γ1 began to decrease after 300 s (Fig. 1). To confirm this finding, we immunoblotted anti-Gβ immunoprecipitates with anti-PLC-γ1 and anti-c-Src antibodies and immunoblotted anti-c-Src-immunoprecipitates with anti-PLC-γ1 and anti-Gβ antibodies. In both cases, we confirmed an increased association between the mentioned proteins after exposure to LTD4, which is shown in Figs. 2 and3. In all experiments we used isotype-matched nonimmune IgG antibodies as a control to exclude the possibility of unspecific associations (designated N in Figs.

See Fig. 1 for explanation of N.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further strengthen and explore the results described above, we employed two different PLC-γ1 GST fusion proteins for their ability to associate with Gβγ subunits and c-Src. We noted that GST fusion proteins of the PLC-γ PH-SH2-SH2-SH3-PH domain, but not of the PLC-γ SH2-SH2-SH3 domain, caused increased precipitation of Gβγ subunits from lysates of LTD4-stimulated cells (Fig.4 B). We also investigated the ability of c-Src from cells exposed to LTD4 to bind to these PLC-γ GST fusion proteins, and we noted that both of these fusion proteins caused increased precipitation of c-Src (Fig.4 A). We also tested the effects of the specific Src tyrosine kinase family inhibitor PP1 on the ability of LTD4 to induce an association between PLC-γ1 and Gβγ subunits. Anti-Gβ subunit immunoprecipitates were obtained from membrane fractions of cells incubated for 15 min in the absence or presence of 10 μm PP1. Pretreatment with PP1 blocked two LTD4-induced effects, namely the association between PLC-γ1 and Gβγ subunits (Fig.5 A) as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (Fig. 5 B). These data suggest that Src kinase activity is involved in the activation of PLC-γ1 and required for the LTD4-induced association between PLC-γ1 and Gβγ subunits. We subsequently investigated autophosphorylation of the Tyr418 residue on Src as a means of determining the activity of the kinase in unexposed cells and cells stimulated with LTD4; data establishing a correlation between such autophosphorylation and Src activity has previously been reported (32.Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar,35.Kimiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In analyzing whole-cell lysates, we found that treatment with LTD4 resulted in a 3-fold increase in phosphorylation of the Tyr418 residue of c-Src, an increase that was blocked by PP1 (Fig. 5 C). To evaluate the significance of the above-mentioned observations for the downstream signaling capacity of PLC-γ1, we microinjected antibodies against Gβ subunits, PLC-γ1, and c-Src and assessed the effects on the LTD4-induced cytosolic free calcium signal by imaging the responses of single cells. As shown in Fig. 6 and TableI, separate injection of anti-Gβ, anti-PLC-γ1 and anti-c-Src antibodies significantly impaired the LTD4-induced calcium signal, whereas the isotype-matched control antibodies had only a negligible effect. In agreement with the results reported above, we found that pretreatment of cells with 10 μm PP1 for 15 min abolished the LTD4-induced calcium signal (data not shown). These findings suggest that each of the investigated signaling proteins is essential for LTD4-induced intracellular release of calcium.Table IStatistical analysis of the effects of microinjected antibodies on the LTD4-induced ΔCa 2+ ratios in single fura-2-loaded Int 407 cellsType of antibodyUninjected cellsCells injected with control antibodiesCells injected with specific antibodiesGβ0.319 ± 0.070.294 ± 0.06aNo significant difference compared to uninjected cells.0.085 ± 0.01bp < 0.01 compared to uninjected cells.PLC-γ10.287 ± 0.080.295 ± 0.08aNo significant difference compared to uninjected cells.0.033 ± 0.08bp < 0.01 compared to uninjected cells.c-Src0.252 ± 0.090.220 ± 0.09aNo significant difference compared to uninjected cells.0.032 ± 0.02bp < 0.01 compared to uninjected cells.Cells were microinjected with anti-Gβ, anti-PLCγ1, anti-c-Src, or isotype-matched control antibodies and subsequently stimulated with 40 nm LTD4.

The results of this study are the first to show an association between PLC-γ1 and Gβγ subunits after agonist stimulationin vivo. Furthermore, by using GST fusion proteins of different domains of PLC-γ1, we found that the LTD4-induced association between PLC-γ1 and Gβγ subunits is most likely mediated by the PH domain of PLC-γ1. That possibility is supported by results obtained in vitro that demonstrate binding between a split PH domain from the PLC-γ1 molecule and purified Gβγ subunits (29.Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, the interaction between PLC-γ1 and Gβγ subunits appeared to be regulated by the number of Gβγ subunits that dissociated from their heterotrimeric complex, because LTD4 increased the amount of Gβγ subunits precipitated by the GST fusion protein of the PLC-γ PH-SH2-SH2-SH3-PH domain. Such a signaling role of the PH domains of PLC-γ1 is also indicated by recent findings showing that the PH domain of the receptor kinase GRK2 is responsible for interaction with a Gβγ subunit (36.Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Richardson M. Stoffel R.H. Robishaw J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2180-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), which implies that Gβγ subunits can interact with different signaling proteins provided their PH domain is properly exposed. We believe that such exposure of the PH domain of PLC-γ1 requires agonist stimulation and activation of a c-Src tyrosine kinase. This assumption stems from our findings that the interaction between PLC-γ1 and Gβγ subunits was significantly increased in cells treated with LTD4 and that this effect could be blocked by PP1, an Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how seven-transmembrane receptors activate Src tyrosine kinases. It was initially found that agonist-induced activation of the Src family kinases Src, Fyn, Yes, and Lyn in various types of cells is sensitive to pertussis toxin (37.Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that these kinases participate in Gi-coupled receptor signaling pathways. Later, it was suggested that Gβγ subunits induce coupling between heterotrimeric G-proteins and c-Src by mediating the formation of a Shc-Grb2-c-Src signaling complex (32.Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Alternatively, other investigators (38.Cheng G. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8152-8155Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) have proposed that Gβγ subunit-induced activation of Btk is caused by interaction with PH domains, which leads to a downstream activation of Src kinases via interaction with the SH3 domain. The present results confirm the findings of Khare et al.(33.Khare S. Bolt M.J.G. Wali R.K. Skarosi S.F. Roy H.K. Niedziela S. Scaglione-Sewell B. Aquino B. Abraham C. Sitrin M.D. Brasitus T.A. Bissonnette M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1831-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), showing that agonist stimulation can induce a physical association between c-Src and PLC-γ; more specifically, the cited investigators treated colonocytes with 1,25(OH)2D3 and observed an increased recovery of c-Src in PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitates. In addition, the present study extends these findings by suggesting that it is primarily the SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 that mediates the interaction with c-Src. It has been proposed that agonist-induced increase in the catalytic activity of PLC-γ1 is due to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues (21.Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), and in our experiments that would have been mediated through activation of Src tyrosine kinase as indicated by an increased autophosphorylation of Src upon LTD4 stimulation. Binding of Src tyrosine kinases to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been found to increase the activity of the latter enzyme (39.Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar); in analogy, the interaction of c-Src and PLC-γ1 may represent an additional mechanism that increases the activity of PLC-γ1. The importance of Gβγ subunits for the agonist-induced PLC-γ1-mediated downstream calcium signal is best demonstrated by our observation that microinjection of Gβ antibodies before LTD4 treatment abolished the mobilization of calcium induced by the agonist. We have previously found that such calcium mobilization is blocked by compactin, an inhibitor of protein isoprenylation (23.Grönroos E. Andersson T. Schippert Å. Zheng L. Sjölander A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This finding can at least partly be due to decreased isoprenylation of Gβγ subunits and to an inadequate association of these proteins with the plasma membrane (40.Myung C.S. Yasuda H. Liu W.W. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16595-16603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that an important function of Gβγ subunits is to directly recruit proteins comprising a PH domain to the cell membrane (29.Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), and our results support such a role for Gβγ subunits in the LTD4-induced mobilization of calcium. However, it has also been shown that Gβγ subunits can indirectly recruit Shc and Grb2 proteins to the membrane via activation of c-Src and tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptors (43.Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Our data imply direct binding between Gβγ subunits and PLC-γ but indirect binding between Gβγ subunits and c-Src. We have previously demonstrated that LTD4 induce activation of Gi3 proteins, as indicated by an increase in the GTP/GDP ratio (22.Adolfsson J.L.P Öhd J.F. Sjölander A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Considering our present results, at least one additional pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein seems to be the source of the free Gβγ subunits that take part in the LTD4-induced interaction with PLC-γ1. This assumption is based on the following observations: activation of the Gi3-protein is sensitive to pertussis toxin; pertussis toxin impairs the interaction between such G-proteins and seven-transmembrane receptors; and LTD4-induced mobilization of calcium is insensitive to pertussis toxin (10.Sjölander A. Grönroos E. Hammarström S. Andersson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20976-20981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interpretation of our findings is in accordance with the well-established concept that seven-transmembrane receptors can activate several different types of heterotrimeric G-proteins (7.Lynch K.R. O'Neill G.P. Liu Q. Im D.-S. Sawyer N. Metters K.M. Coulombe N. Abramovitz M. Figueroa D.J. Zeng Z. Connolly B.M. Bai C. Austin C.P. Chateauneuf A. Stocco R. Greig G.M. Kargman S. Hokks S.B.

Trends Pharmacol. 1989; 3: 103-107Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, in differentiated human U937 cells, the LTD4-induced Ca2+ response is only partially blocked by pertussis toxin, suggesting that this receptor is coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive as well as insensitive G-proteins (11.Crooke S.T. Mattern M. Sarau H.M. Winkler J.D. Balcarek J Wong A. Bennet C.F. Trends Pharmacol. 1989; 3: 103-107Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The identity of the indicated type of LTD4-activated pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein(s) remains to be discovered. Our study is the first to show an agonist-induced in vivoassociation between Gβγ subunits and the downstream signaling protein PLC-γ1. This interaction requires both an increase in free Gβγ subunits and proper exposure of the PH domain of PLC-γ1. These results along with the other findings of our investigation lend additional support to the recent suggestion that Gβγ subunits can directly or indirectly interact with more than one protein and potentially act as docking proteins, leading to the formation of an intracellular signaling complex (44.Wu G.

https://openalex.org/W1997540319,"The role of Ras and MAP kinases (MAPKs) in the regulation of erythroid differentiation was studied using a cell line (SKT6) derived from Friend virus (Anemic strain)-induced murine erythroleukemia. This cell line undergoes differentiation in vitro in response to erythropoietin (EPO) or other chemical inducers such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). When a constitutively active ras mutant (ras12V) was expressed in SKT6 cells, EPO-induced differentiation was inhibited. Conversely, a dominant negative ras mutant (ras17N) induced differentiation even in the absence of EPO, suggesting that the basal Ras activity is essential for the maintenance of the undifferentiated phenotype and proliferative potential in this cell line. Rapid inactivation of ERK was observed after expression of ras17N. Slow but significant inactivation of ERK was also observed during EPO-induced differentiation. Furthermore, overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of ERK-activating kinase (MAPKK) was found to suppress erythroid differentiation, while pharmacological inhibition of MAPKK induced differentiation. These findings suggest that down-regulation of Ras/ERK signaling pathway may be an essential event in EPO-induced erythroid differentiation in this system."

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) largely have replaced rabbit antisera as the LOS typing reagent (6.Jones D.M. Borrow R. Fox A.J. Gray S. Cartwright K.A.V. Poolman J.T. Microb.

For these reasons we have used a variety of mass spectrometric and standard immunochemical techniques to investigate the structural basis of LOS serotype heterogeneity and mAb binding among meningococci that caused sporadic disease. We began with the L1, L8, and L3,7 types. Neisseria LOS structurally resemble human glycosphingolipids (GSL) which often are sialylated (2.Griffiss J.M. Schneider H. Mandrell R.E. Yamassaki R.

Group B and C N. meningitidis endogenously sialylate lacto-N-neotetraose LOS structures (13.Mandrell R.E. Kim J.J. John C.M. Gibson B.W. Sugai J.V. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Yamasaki R. J.

We now report that the α chain of the L1 LOS that mimics the human P k globosyl GSL also is partially sialylated and that L1 strains make a second, alternative LOS structure that we have designated L1a. Whether the L1astructure also is sialylated was not determined. We have extensively characterized N. meningitidis strains 6940 (B:L1) the prototype L1 strain (16.Griffiss J.M. Bannatyne R.M. Artenstein M.S. Anglin C.S. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1974; 229: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and 126E (C:L1,8) (5.Estabrook M.M. Mandrell R.E. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Infect.

The lactamica was isolated from a pharynx and the meningococci from cerebrospinal fluids of Chilean children during an outbreak of group B meningococcal disease in Iquique (20.Boslego J. Garcia J.

We used LOS made by Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain MS11mkD to mark the positions of LOS in SDS-PAGE gels (21.Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Boslego J.W. Hitchcock P.J. Zahos K.M. Apicella M.A. J. Exp.

We used LOS made by N. gonorrhoeae strains 1291, and its pyocin-selected mutants, and by MS11mkD as LOSM r standards (22.John C.M. Griffiss J.M. Apicella M.A. Mandrell R.E. Gibson B.W. J. Biol.

Immun. 1977; 18: 424-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the original polyclonal rabbit antisera, to determine the LOS serotype(s) of 34 consecutive and unique blood and cerebrospinal fluid N. meningitidisisolates from epidemiologically unrelated pediatric patients with endemic disease in Houston, TX, from February 1977 through March 1978 (18.Griffiss J.M.

This system arbitrarily sets 35% of the inhibition of a type-specific antiserum by the homologous prototype strain as the threshold criterion for a serotype designation (1.Zollinger W.D. Mandrell R.E. Infect. Immun. 1977; 18: 424-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then compared the L types of strains, defined by this criterion, with their binding of “serotype-specific” monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), as determined with use of a whole cell dot blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (27.Saunders N.B. Brandt B.L. Warren R.L. Hansen B.D. Zollinger W.D. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mAb 17-2-L1 was selected after immunization of mice with strain 6940 (L1) (28.Zollinger W.D. Mandrell R.E. Infect. Immun. 1983; 40: 257-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); we are designating it the L1 mAb in this report. The L3,7 mAb, 9-2-L379, was selected after immunization of mice with a mixture of three meningococcal strains that expressed several L-types, including L3,7 (28.Zollinger W.D. Mandrell R.E. Infect. Immun. 1983; 40: 257-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The L8 mAb, 2-1-L8, has been characterized extensively; it binds the lactosyl α-oligosaccharide of 3.6-kDa neisserial LOS (2.Griffiss J.M.

Bacteria were grown on supplemented GC agar in a CO2 candle extinction jar, harvested, dehydrated with acetone, and stored at 4 °C until ready for use. We extracted LOS from rehydrated acetone-powdered organisms by a modification of the hot phenol/water method (31.Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Williams G.D. Pier G.B. J. Gen.

We electrophoresed SDS-disaggregated LOS made by selected Neisseria through 11.5 inches of 13.1% polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE), stained them with silver (33.Tsai C.-M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar), and immunoblotted them with mAbs 17-2-L1 (L1), 2-1-L8 (L8), and 9-2-L379 (L3,7) (21.Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Boslego J.W.

We estimated the mass of the L1 and L8 LOS by electrophoresing SDS-disaggregated LOS of meningococcal strain 126E, which makes both, with those of gonococcal strains, MS11mkD and the 1291 series (3.Schneider H. Hale T.L. Zollinger W. Seid Jr., R.C. Hammack C.A. Griffiss J.M. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 544-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MS11mkD makes L8 and L3,7 LOS (21.Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Boslego J.W. Hitchcock P.J. Zahos K.M. Apicella M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1601-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); 1291b and 1291c make L1 and L8 LOS, respectively (22.John C.M.

We used mAbs to locate serotype-specific LOS in the gels. We estimated the molecular weight of the 1291 LOS by assuming that they had diphosphoryl hexaacyl lipoidal moieties (13.Mandrell R.E.

Chem. 1990; 68: 1029-1034Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The derived molecular weight of the diphosphoryl hexaacyl neisserial LOS lipoidal moiety is 1713 (35.Takayama K. Qureshi N. Hyver K.

The observed molecular weights of the (−Kdo) oligosaccharides (OS) released by acid hydrolysis from LOS made by strain 1291 and its mutants are as follows: 1291wt, 1679; 1291a, 1517; 1291b, 1476; 1291c, 1314; 1291d, 1152; and 1291e, 990 (22.John C.M. Griffiss J.M. Apicella M.A. Mandrell R.E. Gibson B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (The 1291d and 1291e mutants each make LOS with (−Kdo) OS of molecular weights of 1152 and 990 but in different abundances (22.John C.M. Griffiss J.M. Apicella M.A. Mandrell R.E. Gibson B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although only ∼20% of the molecules made by 1291d have (−Kdo) OS of M r1152, as compared with ∼50% of those made by 1291e (22.John C.M. Griffiss J.M. Apicella M.A. Mandrell R.E. Gibson B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19303-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we assigned the smaller molecule to 1291e to avoid confusion); we added the mass of Kdo (220) to each. The mass of the OS of the “5.4-kDa” LOS made by MS11mkD (21.Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Boslego J.W. Hitchcock P.J. Zahos K.M. Apicella M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1601-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was calculated by adding the mass of GalNAc (203) to that of the 1291wt OS (22.John C.M. Griffiss J.M.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10566-10575Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The mass of each OS, minus the mass of H2O lost by linkage to the lipoidal moiety (−18), then was added to the calculated molecular weight of the lipoidal moiety, 1713. The calculated molecular weights of the native LOS were as follows: MS11mkD, 3797; 1291wt, 3594; 1291a, 3432; 1291b, 3391; 1291c, 3229; 1291d, 3067; and 1291e, 2905. The coefficient of correlation (r) between the electrophoretic mobilities of the gonococcal LOS and their derived molecular weights was 0.989. We used the function that described this correlation (M r = (158.5 −rd)/0.029) to calculate an estimated molecular weight for each of the four 126E LOS bands in the SDS-PAGE gel and then calculated the nominal triply charged ESI-MS negative ion that LOS of each of these estimated molecular weights would yield after deacylation. We used the formula shown in Equation 1,ESI­MS ion=(((Mr−760−42)−3)/3)Equation 1 where 760 is the mass of the ester-linked laurate residues and 42 the mass of the γ GlcNAc O-acetate groups that are removed during deacylation (10.Kim J.J. Phillips N.J. Gibson B.W. Griffiss J.M. Yamasaki R. Infect. Inunun. 1994; 62: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Gibson B.W. Melaugh W. Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Campagnari A.A. Griffiss J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2702-2712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then sought each of these ions in the triply charged region of ESI-MS spectra of 126E LOS. LOS were deacylated with anhydrous hydrazine, as described (38.Helander I.M. Lindner B. Brade H. Altmann K. Lindberg A.A. Rietschel E.T. Zähringer U. Eur. J.

Mass Spectrom. 1990; 19: 731-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Heterogeneity among lipoidal moieties is accounted for by different numbers of ester-linked β-OH-C12 and C12fatty acids (31.Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Williams G.D. Pier G.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 128: 13-22PubMed Google Scholar). Deacylation, therefore, yields a homogeneous lipoidal moiety that consists of two GlcN residues, two amide-linked β-OH-C14 fatty acid residues, and two phosphate residues (35.Takayama K. Qureshi N. Hyver K. Honovich J. Cotter R.J. Mascagni P. Schneider H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10624-10631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); its average molecular weight is 953.0089 (36.Gibson B.W. Melaugh W. Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Campagnari A.A. Griffiss J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2702-2712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The γ-GlcNAcO-acetate also is lost during deacylation. We analyzed samples of O-deacylated LOS by ESI-MS with a VG Bio-Q mass spectrometer with an electrospray ion source. Scans were taken in the negative ion mode over the m/z range of 300–2000 at a resolution of ∼500. LOS samples were dissolved in distilled water at a final concentration of 1–3 μg/μl, and 3-μl aliquots were injected via a Rheodyne injector into a constant stream of H2O/acetonitrile (75:25%, v/v) containing 1% acetic acid as a solvent (36.Gibson B.W. Melaugh W. Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Campagnari A.A. Griffiss J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2702-2712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A flow rate of 2–4 μl/min was maintained throughout the analysis with an Isco syringe pump. Mass calibration used horse heart myoglobin as a reference, and the software was supplied by VG Bio-Q; the instrument was tuned in the negative ion mode with sulfated cholecystokinin-8 (Peninsula Laboratories). Spectra were averaged over several scans and digitally smoothed (36.Gibson B.W. Melaugh W. Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Campagnari A.A. Griffiss J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2702-2712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For relatively abundant peaks the accuracy was ±0.3 m/z; for poorly defined, low abundance peaks it was ±0.4–0.8 m/z. O-Deacylated LOS form deprotonated species that are preferentially in charge state z = 3 and to a lesser extent in charge state z = 2 (36.Gibson B.W. Melaugh W. Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Campagnari A.A. Griffiss J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2702-2712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Triply charged molecular ions appear as doublets, 6 mass units apart, because ions that have lost a water molecule (m/z = 18/3 = 6) are formed by variable lactonization of a Kdo residue (Kdo2) during ionization (36.Gibson B.W. Melaugh W. Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Campagnari A.A. Griffiss J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2702-2712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); lactonized ions are indicated in the text by an asterisk. Neisserial LOS OS are composed of hexoses (Hex),N-acetylhexosamines (HexNAc), heptose (Hep), Kdo, sialic acid (NeuNAc), phosphoethanolamine (PEA), and an O-acetyl group. Two Hep residues, two Kdo residues, and theO-acetylated γ-GlcNAc are conserved (2.Griffiss J.M. Schneider H. Mandrell R.E. Yamassaki R. Jarvis G.A. Kim J.J. Gibson B.W. Hamadeh R. Apicella M.A. Rev.

We used a computer program to generate all compositions that would have a molecular weight that was consistent with that of eachO-deacylated LOS molecular ion that was resolved sufficiently in the 126E LOS ESI-MS spectrum. We considered only those compositions that were comprised of known LOS constituents, contained two Hep residues, two Kdo residues, an O-deacylated GlcNAc residue, and an O-deacylated, diphosphoryl lipoidal moiety and that would yield a triply charged ion that was within 1m/z of each observed ESI-MS ion (36.Gibson B.W. Melaugh W. Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Campagnari A.A. Griffiss J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2702-2712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For predicting the molecular weights of the various compositions we used the following interval average mass values: H, 1.0082; H2O, 18.0153; Hex, 162.1424; Hep, 192.1687; HexNAc, 203.1949; Kdo, 220.1791; NeuNAc, 291.2579; PEA, 123.0482; acetate, 42.0373; and O-deacylated lipid, 953.0089. The appropriate interval average mass values were added to that of theO-deacylated lipid. For calculating the molecular weights of native LOS, we added the interval nominal mass values to 1713, the nominal molecular weight of the conserved diphosphoryl hexaacyl lipoidal moiety (31.Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Williams G.D. Pier G.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 128: 13-22PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Takayama K. Qureshi N. Hyver K. Honovich J. Cotter R.J. Mascagni P. Schneider H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10624-10631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OSs were released from LOS by hydrolysis with 1% acetic acid (100 °C, 2 h) (9.Yamasaki R. Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Mandrell R.E. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We centrifuged the hydrolysate twice for 20 min at 4 °C and 7000 rpm; the supernatant with released OS was lyophilized, redissolved in 52 mm pyridinium acetate (5–10 mg/ml), and separated by chromatography through 180 cm of Bio-Gel P-4 (<400 mesh) equilibrated with 52 mm pyridinium acetate. The eluate was monitored by refractometry and collected in 1.67-ml fractions. We dephosphorylated LOS and OS by hydrolysis with HF. LOS and OS were reacted with a 48% (aqueous) HF solution (10 μg of LOS per μl) in the dark at 4 °C for 16–20 h (OS and O-deacylated LOS) or 36–40 h (intact LOS) (9.Yamasaki R. Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Mandrell R.E. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After evaporation of HF, the residues were resuspended in H2O and lyophilized. For composition analysis of neutral sugars, we dissolved 20 μg (∼10 nm) of dephosphorylated OS in 200 μl of H2O, added 200 μl of 4m trifluoroacetic acid, and heated the mixture for 4.25 h at 100 °C (40.Hardy M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 179: 76-82Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For quantitation of HexNAcs, we substituted concentrated HCl for 4 m trifluoroacetic acid (40.Hardy M.

We evaporated the hydrolysates to dryness in a Speed-Vac concentrator, and we carried out monosaccharide separation and quantitation with use of high pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection, as described (39.Phillips N.J.

To elute the monosaccharide components, the gradient was modified slightly as follows: (i) 20 mm NaOH for 22 min, (ii) linear to 50 mm NaOH in 10 min, (iii) linear to 100 mm NaOH and 100 mm sodium acetate in 3 min, and (iv) linear to 160 mm sodium acetate in 15 min (with NaOH kept constant at 100 mm). A monosaccharide mixture that contained known quantities of fucose, GalNH2, GlcNH2, galactose (Gal), and glucose (Glc) (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) was used as a standard. The authentic monosaccharide liberated from the OS ofSalmonella typhimurium Ra mutant LPS was used as a standard for the identification ofl-glycero-d-manno-heptose (41.Phillips N.J.

We used a combination of liquid secondary ion (LSIMS) and tandem (MS/MS) mass spectrometry and methylation analysis to confirm compositions and determine the sequences and linkages of the component sugars (13.Mandrell R.E.

Oligosaccharides were dissolved in H2O, and aliquots were transferred to a stainless steel probe tip that had been charged with approximately 1 μl of a glycerol/thioglycerol (1:1) matrix.O-Deacylated HF-treated LOS were first dissolved in H2O/methanol (1:1). Samples for LSIMS were analyzed with a Kratos MS-50 double focusing mass spectrometer operating at a mass resolution of 1500–2000 (m/Δm, 10% valley). Samples were sputtered and ionized with a Cs+ ion primary beam of 10 keV; secondary ions were accelerated at 6–8 kV. Scans were acquired at 300 s/decade (22.John C.M. Griffiss J.M.

Ultramark 1621 was used manually to calibrate spectra to an accuracy of better than ±0.2 Da. MS/MS spectra were gotten with a four-sector Kratos Concept II HH mass spectrometer with an optically coupled diode array detector on MS-2 (22.John C.M. Griffiss J.M. Apicella M.A. Mandrell R.E.

Spectra were acquired in the negative mode; a Cs+ ion primary beam energy of 18 keV was used to sputter and ionize the oligosaccharides. The deprotonated molecular ions (M − H)− were selected in MS-1 and passed through to the helium collision cell floated at 2 keV, and pressure was adjusted to attenuate the precursor molecular ion by approximately 65%. Fragment ions were separated in MS-2 with use of a magnet jump with successive 4% mass windows and a constant B/E ratio. Fragment ions were detected on a one-inch optically coated diode array detector, and masses were assigned automatically by a Kratos Mach 3 data system that used CsI as an external reference for both MS-1 and MS-2. The mass spectra were interpreted on the basis of the established structures of gonococcal LOS that bi"

Previously, we have shown that this requirement is lost in PAX3-FKHR, the product of a t(2;13) chromosomal translocation associated with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. In contrast to Pax3, the chimeric PAX3-FKHR, which acts as an oncogene, can efficiently activate a DNA sequence element containing only a homeodomain binding site (TAATAN2–3ATTA), despite the presence of an intact Pax3 paired domain. Here, we showed that this alteration in sequence-specific transcription activity was determined in part by the transactivation domain. First, we demonstrated that in intact Pax3, substitution of the Pax3 transactivation domain with an unrelated viral VP16 transactivation domain enabled Pax3 to transactivate homeodomain-specific DNA sequence, as well as to transform fibroblasts. Furthermore, we could abolish the homeodomain-dependent transcription and transforming activities of PAX3-FKHR by replacing its FKHR transactivation domain with Pax3 transactivation domain. Collectively, these results suggested that the transactivation domain influences the DNA binding specificity of Pax3. The translocation process increased the oncogenic potential of Pax3 by removing the inhibitory action of Pax3 transactivation domain on its homeodomain.

Developmental defects in homozygous Splotch mutants include exencephaly, spina bifida, and deficiency in neural crest derivatives and limb muscle formation. In humans, Waardenburg's syndrome is characterized by defects in pigmentation, craniofacial structure, and limb musculature (specific for type III). In addition to the loss of function mutations, gain of function mutation of Pax3 resulting from chromosomal translocation is associated with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a family of soft tissue tumors of skeletal muscle lineage that occurs most frequently in children and young adolescent (12.Douglass E.C. Valentine M. Etcubanas E. Parham D.

Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 983-987PubMed Google Scholar). The two genes involved in the translocation breakpoints have been identified as the Pax3gene (chromosome 2) and the FKHR gene (chromosome 13) (19.Barr F.G. Galili N. Holick J.m Biegel J.A. Rovera G. Emanuel B.S. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 20.Galili N. Davis R. Fredericks W.J. Mukhopadhyay S. Rauscher III, F.J. Emanuel B.S. Nat.

Pax3 contains two DNA binding domains: a paired box domain common to all members of the Pax family transcription factors and a Prd-type homeodomain that is also found in Pax4 and Pax6 (22.Strachan R. Read A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The Pax3 transcription activation domain is localized within a serine-, glycine-, and threonine-rich region at the COOH terminus. TheFKHR gene is related to the developmentally regulatedHNF3/forkhead gene family (23.Anderson M.J. Viars C.S. Czekay S. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Genomics. 1998; 47: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 24.Borkhardt A. Repp R. Haas O.A. Leis T. Harbott J. Kreuder J. Hammermann J. Henn T. Lampert F.

This family is characterized by a conserved winged-helix DNA binding domain at the NH2 terminus and a proline-rich acidic transcriptional activation domain at its COOH terminus. The t(2;13) translocation leads to the creation of a PAX3-FKHR chimeric gene that combines the 5′ sequence of the Pax3 gene coding both DNA binding domains of Pax3 to the 3′ sequence of the FKHR gene encoding a partial (bisected) winged helix DNA binding domain and the proline- and acid-rich transactivation domain (19.Barr F.G.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5108-5112PubMed Google Scholar). Although in vivo target genes of Pax3 are currently unknown, Pax3 can bind with high affinity in vitro to a complex e5 DNA response element derived from Drosophila even skipped promoter for the Eve transcription factor (1.Goulding M.D. Chalepakis G. Deutsch U. Erselius J.R. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). This sequence contains a paired domain recognition site GTTCC (PRS-1) adjacent to a homeodomain recognition site (ATTA). The in vitro electrophoresis mobility shift assay and in vivo transfection experiments reveal that both the paired domain and the homeodomain binding sites are required for Pax3 function, suggesting a synergistic interaction between the two DNA domains with the ATTA and GTTCC DNA recognition sites (11.Chalepakis G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3131-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition to the DNA binding and transactivation domains, a putative repressor domain has recently been identified within the NH2-terminal 29 amino acid residues overlapping the paired domain of the Pax3, and it functions to inhibit the basal promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner (27.Bennicelli J.L. Edwards R.H. Barr F.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5455-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,28.Chalepakis G. Jones F.S. Eelman G.M. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12745-12749Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because both DNA binding domains of the Pax3 protein are intact whereas the FKHR winged helix DNA binding domain is disrupted in the chimeric PAX3-FKHR protein, it is postulated that Pax3-responsive genes would also be targets for the transcriptional activation of PAX3-FKHR. Indeed, many Pax3-responsive sequences thus far identified also respond to PAX3-FKHR (29.Fredericks W.J. Galili N. Mukhopadhyay S. Rovera G. Bennicelli J. Barr F.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAX3-FKHR is also a more potent transcription activator than Pax3 (29.Fredericks W.J. Galili N. Mukhopadhyay S. Rovera G. Bennicelli J. Barr F.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that PAX3-FKHR elicits its oncogenic activity by abnormally up-regulating Pax3-dependent genes. Recently, our laboratory has described a novel mechanism by which PAX3-FKHR gains the ability to transcriptionally regulate DNA sequences that are not normally responsive to Pax3, by recognizing a palindromic paired type homeodomain site from the platelet-derived growth factor-α receptor promoter referred to as P3 (30.Epstein J.A. Song B. Lakki M. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4118-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of the Pax3 paired domain in PAX3-FKHR has no effect on its transforming activity in NIH3T3 cells, suggesting that homeodomain action alone is sufficient for transforming activity of PAX3-FKHR (31.Lam P.Y.P. Sublett J.E. Hollenbach A.D. Roussel M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have analyzed the structure-function requirements for the altered homeodomain DNA recognition specificity between Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR. Our results show that the Pax3 transactivation domain plays a central role in regulating the activity of the Prd type homeodomain. pCMV expression vector containing the mouse Pax3 and Pax3 mutant cDNAs has been described previously (32.Epstein J.A. Lam P. Jepeal L. Maas R.L. Shapiro D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11719-11722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3 expression vector constructs containing the wild type and mutant PAX3-FKHR cDNAs were obtained from J. Epstein (University of Pennsylvania) and have been described previously (29.Fredericks W.J. Galili N. Mukhopadhyay S. Rovera G. Bennicelli J. Barr F.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell.

A. 1996; 6. 93: 9805-9809Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In brief, the plasmid encoding PAX3-FKHR is a mouse-human composed of murine Pax3 (GenBankTM accession number X59358, nucleotides 313–719) encoding an amino acid sequence identical to that of human Pax3, followed by human PAX3-FKHR (GenBankTM accession numberU02368, nucleotides 471–2556) and a sequence encoding a nine-residue carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag (YDVPDYASL). The PAX3-FKHR plasmid constructs that contain all three possible ATG translation start codons are referred in this report as the full-length, whereas the previously described PAX3-FKHR constructs that contain only the second and third ATG codons from Pax3 are referred to as NH2-terminally truncated PAX3-FKHR constructs (GenBankTM accession number AF178854). The GAL4-VP16 construct was a generous gift from Dr. Michael Green (Massachusetts Medical School). The plasmid construct encoding Pax3/VP16 or Pax3mut/VP16 is composed of murine Pax3 or Pax3mut (GenBankTM accession number X59358, nucleotides 298–1420), followed by a linker sequence (GAATTCCCGGGGATCTGG) and ending with a VP16 sequence (GenBankTM accession number U89963, nucleotides 418–672). The plasmid construct encoding PAX3-FKHR, the FKHR transactivation domain of which is replaced by the Pax3 transactivation domain, is constructed by first removing the FKHR transactivation domain of PAX3-FKHR (GenBankTM accession number U2368, nucleotides 1833–2559 and the nine amino acid residues of hemagglutinin tag) and then cloning in its place the murine Pax3 transactivation domain (GenBankTM accession number X59358, nucleotides 1334–1737). All expression constructs used in this study were tested to confirm that they expressed correctly sized protein products by a combination of in vitro translation and Western blot analysis. The retroviral expression vector (pBabe-puromycine) was described previously (34.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). Pax3, PAX3-FKHR, and their derivatives were cloned into the pBabe retroviral expression vector at the BamHI site. Retrovirus producing Phoenix cell line was obtained from Dr. Gary Dolan (University of California). PAX3-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Jonathan Epstein (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The reporter CAT1 gene constructs have been described previously (30.Epstein J.A. Song B. Lakki M. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4118-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35.Wang C. Song B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 712-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayer culture of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells were maintained on tissue culture dishes that were pretreated with 0.3% gelatin in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium supplemented with 200 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, and 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum. Murine NIH3T3 cells and Phoenix cells were cultured in the same medium as for P19 but without sodium pyruvate. Retroviruses expressing PAX3, PAX3-FKHR, or their variant genes were generated by first plating 2 × 106 Phoenix cells onto 60-mm tissue culture dish 24 h prior to transfection. A total of 10 μg of pBabe expression vector (plus or minus the cDNA) was introduced into Phoenix cells by CaPO4 method. After 17 h incubation with DNA, cells were thoroughly rinsed with Tris-based saline and supplemented with fresh growth medium. Cells were allowed to grow for 24 h before the conditioned medium containing retrovirus was filtered and used for infection. Fresh retroviral stocks were used for experiments whenever possible. If stocks were not used within 1 week, they were aliquoted and kept at –80 °C for long term storage. Twenty-four hours prior to infection, NIH3T3 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/100-mm dish. Cells were replenished with fresh medium 4 h before the addition of retrovirus (in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene). Cells were allowed to incubate in the presence of virus for a period of 17–24 h before medium change. To establish clonal cell lines, cells were split 1:10 into 150-mm dishes, and single isolates were allowed to form for a period of 14 days in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycine. Five to 10 single clones were isolated, expanded, and characterized for protein expression by Western blot analysis before they were used for transformation assays. For each construct, we also expanded and characterized pooled cell populations (>1000 clones) in parallel to verify that results were not due to clonal variability. Transformation of NIH3T3 cells by Pax3, PAX3-FKHR, and their variants was tested using a colony formation in soft agar culture assay (anchorage-independent growth). A total of 1 × 104 cells in 0.3% Noble agar (in growth medium) was laid over a solid support base containing 2% Noble agar (in growth medium). The cells were allowed to grow in suspension for a period of 21–30 days with fresh medium supplementation every 3 days before colonies were counted and photographed. Transient transfection was carried out by plating P19 cells at a density of 2 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish 24 h prior to transient transfection. Transient transfection was carried out with a total of 20 μg of DNA that included 1–3 μg of β-galactosidase DNA (LacZ) driven by the β-actin promoter as an internal standard for monitoring transfection efficiency. P19 cells were exposed to DNA-CaPO4 precipitate for 17 h, rinsed, and re-fed with growth medium for an additional 48 h before harvest. Cell lysates for lacZ and CAT assays were prepared as described previously (30.Epstein J.A. Song B. Lakki M. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4118-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Deacetylase activity in the lysate was inactivated by heating the lysates to 60 °C for 7 min (36.Mercola M. Goverman J. Mirell C. Calame K. Science. 1985; 227: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A typical CAT assay reaction mixture consisted of 0.7 μg of acetyl-CoA, 0.2 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol (1 Ci = 37 GBq), and cell lysates in a final volume of 150 μl. The amount of cell lysate used in each CAT reaction was standardized by its β-galactosidase activity. Unless stated otherwise, the routine CAT assays were carried out at 37 °C for 1–3 h and terminated by extraction with 1 ml of ice-cold ethyl acetate. Quantitative analysis of CAT activity was carried out by measuring the radioactivity of each radioactive spot in β-scintillation counter. To verify proper expression of the different constructs that we made from the Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR constructs, the cDNAs were subjected to in vitrotranscription/translation reaction using T7-TNT system (Promega). Sample were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and later transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis. For detecting in vivo expression of Pax3, PAX3-FKHR, and their derivatives, confluent cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and lysed in the presence of radioimmune precipitation buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 500 μm orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Whole cell lysates were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blot. The expression of PAX3, PAX3-FKHR, or their derivatives was detected by chemiluminescent antibody detection kit (NEN Life Science Products) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The primary rabbit polyclonal PAX3 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:500. The secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody was used at a dilution of 1:3000. Previously we have shown that the tumor-specific chimeric protein PAX3-FKHR, but not its normal Pax3 counterpart, can transactivate the P3 homeodomain-specific DNA sequence (TAATN3ATTA) (30.Epstein J.A. Song B. Lakki M. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4118-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because both Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR fusion protein contain the same DNA binding domains, we seek to determine how other region(s) of the proteins might influence the selective action on the homeodomain sequence by PAX3-FKHR but not by Pax3. The full-length human and mouse Pax3 cDNAs contain three in-frame ATG codons. It is presently unknown which of the three ATG codons (any one or two or all three) are used for in vivo expression of Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR in development and in rhabdomyosarcoma formation. If all three codons were used in vivo, polypeptides that differ by 10 or 11 amino acid residues at the NH2 terminus would be expressed. The clone of PAX3-FKHR used in our previous study began from the second ATG codon (this NH2-terminally truncated PAX3-FKHR is referred to here as tPF). We investigated whether the deletion of the first 10 amino acids could account for the different homeodomain action detected in Pax3 or PAX3-FKHR. We addressed this question by two independent approaches. First, we determined the effect by deleting the NH2-terminal 10 amino acid residues from the full-length Pax3 cDNA (tPax3) on transactivation (Fig.1 A). The assay was performed by co-transfecting either the full-length Pax3 or tPax3 into P19 cells with the CAT reporter gene construct that contained either the complex e5 (6e5-ECCAT, Fig. 1 B) or the simple homeodomain-specific P3 (P3-TKCAT, Fig. 1 B) response element. The homeodomain-specific P3 element contains a palindromic consensus sequence (TAATN3ATTA) specific for the binding of Prd type homeodomain-containing proteins as determined by in vitroDNA-protein binding assay (37.Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit R. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 38.Wilson D.S. Guenther B. Desplan C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 82: 709-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In our previous study (30.Epstein J.A. Song B. Lakki M. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4118-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we have shown that the tPF, like Pax3, can transactivate a reporter construct containing the complex e5 sequence and that this transactivation function requires intact paired domain and homeodomain. By contrast, tPF, but not Pax3, can transactivate a reporter construct containing the homeodomain-specific P3 sequence, and this transactivation function requires only an intact homeodomain in tPF. As shown in Fig.1 C, both Pax3 and tPax3 were equally active in transactivating the 6e5-ECCAT construct. Mutation of the Pax3 paired domain (Pax3mut-Bu26, tPax3mut-Bu35, and tPax3mut-Un1) abolished transactivation by both full-length Pax3 and tPax3. The Bu26 (P50L), Bu35 (R56L), and UN1 (G48S) mutations represent naturally occurring missense mutations found of the paired domain of Pax3 (4.Gruss P. Walther C. Cell. 1992; 69: 719-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and all three mutations have previously been shown to abrogate the DNA binding activity of Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR toward the complex e5 DNA sequence. Under the same assay conditions, neither Pax3 nor tPax3 could transactivate the P3-TKCAT construct (Fig.1 D). In a second approach, we reintroduced the sequences encoding the NH2-terminal 10 amino acids back into tPF (Fig.2 A) and examined whether these residues could block the independent homeodomain specificity of the full-length PAX3-FKHR (referred to here as PF). As could be predicted from results in Fig. 1, both wild type PF and tPF transactivated the 6e5-ECCAT construct, whereas their corresponding paired domain mutants (PF-Bu26 and tPF-Bu35) were inactive (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, both PF and tPF, as well as their corresponding paired domain mutants, remained transcriptionally active toward the P3-TKCAT construct (Fig.2 C). The observed transactivation was clearly mediated through a specific interaction between the homeodomain region of the proteins and the homeodomain-specific P3 sequence because mutation of the homeodomain region in these proteins (PF-HD and tHD) or mutation of the P3 consensus sequence (mP3) completely abolished the transactivation activity of PF and tPF. It should be noted that although there was no difference in the specificity of PF and tPF to transactivate reporter construct containing either the complex e5 or homeodomain-specific P3 response element, we did observe a significant increase in background activity by the full-length PAX3-FKHR. This increase in background activity was not observed with the Pax3 construct (see under “Discussion”). Taken together, the data from Figs. 1 and 2 indicated that NH2-terminal 10 amino acid residues of Pax3 did not play a role in controlling the transcriptional potency or in the homeodomain specificity of both Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR proteins. We next tested the possibility that DNA sequences downstream of the Pax3 DNA binding domain may mediate the difference between Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR in transactivation of the P3-TKCAT construct. To begin addressing this question, we deleted intervening sequences between the DNA binding domains and the COOH-terminal transactivation domain from Pax3 and from Pax3mut-Bu26, a paired domain mutant (Fig.3 A). In addition, we also substituted the viral VP16 transactivation domain for the Pax3 transactivation domain in Pax3 and Pax3mut-Bu26 (Fig.3 A). Each of these constructs was co-transfected into P19 cells with either the 6e5-ECCAT (Fig. 3 B) or P3-TKCAT (Fig.3 C) reporter gene constructs. As shown in Fig.3 B, neither the intervening sequence nor the Pax3 transactivation domain was required to transactivate the complex e5 containing reporter gene construct. As expected, none of the paired domain mutant expression vectors could transactivate the complex e5 sequence. Strikingly, substitution of the VP16 transactivation domain for the Pax3 transactivation domain enabled Pax3 to transactivate the P3-TKCAT construct (Fig. 3 C). This transactivation was homeodomain-specific because mutation of the paired domain (Pax3mut/VP16) did not affect transactivation of the P3-TKCAT construct. The internal deletion mutants of Pax3 (Pax3 del.8 and Pax3mutdel.8) remained unable to transactivate the homeodomain-specific P3 DNA sequence. Collectively, these data led us to hypothesize that the COOH-terminal Pax3 transactivation domain played a decisive role in blocking Pax3 action toward homeodomain. If so, substitution of the FKHR transactivation domain by Pax3 transactivation domain in PAX3-FKHR would relieve the negative constraint imposed on the homeodomain by Pax3 transactivation domain, allowing it to function as an independent DNA binding domain in the fusion protein. To test this hypothesis, we replaced the FKHR transactivation domain with the Pax3 transactivation domain in wild type and paired domain mutant of PF and tPF (Fig.4 A). When these constructs were co-transfected into cells with the 6e5ECCAT, they were able to transactivate the complex e5 sequence (Fig. 4 B). As expected, these constructs containing the Pax3 transactivation domain showed a lower fold induction than the constructs containing the FKHR transactivation domain. Most interestingly, replacement of the FKHR transactivation domain with the Pax3 transactivation domain in PF and tPF and their paired domain mutants (PF-Bu26/Pax3Td and tPD/Pax3Td, respectively) rendered the proteins inactive toward the P3-TKCAT construct (Fig. 4 C). The paired domain deletion mutant of PAX3-FKHR (tPDNH2) contains a deletion of the first three helices of paired domain (Asn53 to Thr93) that is important for DNA contact. As expected, the paired domain mutants were also inactive. Thus far, we have presented evidence from the transfection assay to suggest that the COOH-terminal transactivation domain of Pax3 played a key role in the sequence specificity of transactivation. Could our observation be correlated to the biological activity of the PAX3-FKHR fusion protein? We examined this issue by testing the effect of Pax3 transactivation domain substitution on the ability of PAX3-FKHR to induce cell transformation (Fig. 5). We used the retroviral expression system to induce stable expression of PAX3-FKHR and its derivatives in N"

By subjecting extracts from E5-transformed or PDGF-treated cells to velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradients, activated PDGF β receptor complexes were separated from monomeric, inactive receptor. Rapidly sedimenting activated complexes contained oligomeric (apparently dimeric), tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF β receptor, the E5 protein, and associated cellular signaling proteins including the p85 subunit of phosphoinositol 3′-kinase, phospholipase Cγ, and Ras-GTPase activating protein. These signaling proteins made the major contribution to the increased sedimentation rate of the activated receptor complexes. Pairwise analysis of components of these complexes indicated that multiple signaling proteins and the E5 protein were simultaneously present in the activated complexes. Our results also showed that the E5 protein and PDGF activated only a small fraction of the total PDGF β receptor, that not all receptor molecules associated with the E5 protein were tyrosine-phosphorylated, and that signaling proteins could bind to hemiphosphorylated receptor dimers. On the basis of these results, we propose a model for the assembly of multiprotein, activated PDGF β receptor complexes in response to the E5 protein.

One of the best studied RTKs is the PDGF β receptor, which is normally activated when the dimeric ligand, PDGF-BB, binds to its extracellular domain. This results in homodimerization of the receptor andtrans-phosphorylation of the two receptor molecules in the dimeric receptor complex on multiple tyrosine residues (Refs. 1.Bishayee S. Majumdar S.

One of the major sites of receptor autophosphorylation is in the “activation loop” of the kinase domain, and phosphorylation at this site increases the intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor, apparently by removing inhibitory constraints on substrate or ATP binding (6.Escobedo J.A.

Numerous other tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor are also phosphorylated following PDGF treatment, thereby generating specific binding sites for a variety of cellular signaling and regulatory molecules that contain SH2 domains, including members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, the 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85) of phosphoinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3′-kinase), phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), the phosphatase SHP-2, STAT factors, Ras-GTPase activating protein (RasGAP), and a number of SH2-containing adaptor proteins (10.Koch C.A.

The existence of signal transfer particles consisting of an activated RTK and associated signaling proteins was postulated by Ullrich and Schlessinger 10 years ago (20.Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). However, despite extensive analysis of RTK function, there have been relatively few attempts to purify such signaling complexes intact and characterize them. Numerous studies have used co-immunoprecipitation to demonstrate that particular signaling proteins are stably associated with activated RTKs, and ternary complexes containing activated PDGF β receptor, PI 3′-kinase, and PLCγ can assemble in vitro (21.Herbst R. Shearman M.S. Jallal B. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5971-5979Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradients has been used to separate dimeric PDGF β receptor from monomeric receptor, and this dimeric fraction displayed increased tyrosine kinase activity in vitro (1.Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Khire J. Das M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11699-11705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, other proteins, if any, in the dimeric fraction were not characterized. Carraway and co-workers (22.Juang S.-H. Carvajal M.E. Whitney M. Liu Y. Carothers Carraway C.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1033-1042PubMed Google Scholar) reported that microvillar fractions of rat mammary carcinoma cells contain a very large (>2 × 106 Da) heterogeneous transmembrane complex or signal transduction particle that contains microfilaments, the activated RTK p185 neu, serine/threonine kinases including enzymes of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, phosphotyrosine phosphatases, p60c-src, p120c-abl, a retroviral Gag-like protein, and various other cellular glycoproteins (22.Juang S.-H. Carvajal M.E. Whitney M. Liu Y. Carothers Carraway C.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1033-1042PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and column chromatography of extracts of colony stimulatory factor 1-stimulated macrophages have been used to detect high molecular weight complexes containing colony stimulatory factor 1 receptor and numerous signaling proteins (23.Kanagasundaram V.

The bovine papillomavirus (BPV) E5 protein is a very short, dimeric transmembrane oncoprotein that specifically activates the PDGF β receptor (25.Petti L. Nilson L. DiMaio D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 26.Schlegel R. Wade-Glass M. Rabson M.S. Yang Y.-C.

Genet. 1998; 33: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The E5-activated receptor is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase in vitro, is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine, and is constitutively bound to downstream signaling substrates (25.Petti L. Nilson L. DiMaio D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 28.Drummond-Barbosa D. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2570-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, cells that normally do not express the PDGF receptor and are non-responsive to the E5 protein are rendered susceptible to E5-induced transformation by introduction of a gene encoding the PDGF β receptor, but not by genes encoding other RTKs (28.Drummond-Barbosa D. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2570-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Goldstein D.J. Li W. Wang L.-M. Heidaran M.A. Aaronson S.A. Shinn R. Schlegel R.

Recently, we showed that treatment of E5-transformed cells with a specific inhibitor of the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase resulted in rapid, reversible receptor dephosphorylation and inhibition of the transformed phenotype (31.Klein O. Polack G.W. Surti T. Kegler-Ebo D. Smith S.O. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8921-8932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these experiments provide compelling evidence that the E5 protein activates the PDGF β receptor, resulting in cell transformation. The E5 protein and PDGF are structurally dissimilar, suggesting that the mechanism of PDGF β receptor activation by these two proteins is quite different. Indeed, the ligand-binding domain of the PDGF β receptor is not required for activation by the viral protein, demonstrating that E5-induced PDGF β receptor activation is ligand-independent (28.Drummond-Barbosa D. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2570-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Staebler A. Pierce J.H. Brazinski S. Heidaran M.A. Li W. Schlegel R. Goldstein D.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6507-6517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that the E5 protein, like PDGF, binds to the receptor; however, unlike PDGF, binding of the E5 protein occurs to the transmembrane and extracellular juxtamembrane region of the receptor (28.Drummond-Barbosa D.

A. 1992; 89: 6736-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have shown that stable complex formation between the E5 protein and the PDGF β receptor caused receptor activation by inducing receptor dimerization and trans-phosphorylation (38.Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). On the basis of extensive mutational analysis, computational studies and other considerations, we have proposed a model of the interaction between the PDGF β receptor and dimeric E5 protein that explains how complex formation results in receptor dimerization and activation (27.Surti T. Klein O. Ascheim K., D. DiMaio D Smith S.O. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 33: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here, by using sucrose gradient velocity sedimentation of non-ionic detergent extracts of E5-transformed and PDGF-treated cells, we have physically separated stable complexes containing activated PDGF β receptor from the inactive receptor. Our results demonstrated that only a small fraction of PDGF β receptor is activated in these cells and that the increased sedimentation rate of the activated complexes is due to receptor dimerization and the stable association of the activated receptor with multiple signaling proteins. These studies revealed several features of the activated PDGF β receptor and provided insight into the assembly and composition of multiprotein signaling complexes containing activated PDGF β receptor. C127 and Ba/F3 cells were maintained as described previously (28.Drummond-Barbosa D. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, C127 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Ba/F3 hematopoietic cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, β-mercaptoethanol, and interleukin-3. Ba/F3 cell lines expressing various combinations of exogenous genes were described previously (38.Palacios R. Steinmetz M.

For the experiment shown in Fig. 3, Ba/F3 cells expressing the wild-type human PDGF β receptor were treated with 50 ng/ml recombinant human PDGF BB (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 7 min at room temperature or left untreated. The following PDGF β receptor mutants were used: ΔPR, which has a deletion of most of the extracellular ligand binding domain, and R634, which is a full-length human PDGF β receptor with a mutation that eliminates tyrosine kinase function (39.Lai C.C. Henningson C. DiMaio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15241-15246Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ba/F3 cells or serum-starved C127 cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 3 mmKCl, 1.0 mm KH2PO4, 8.0 mm Na2HPO4) and lysed in TG buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.01% sodium azide) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The final concentration of extract was made up to 6 mg/ml. 0.5 ml of extract was layered on the top of a 5-ml linear 5–25% sucrose gradient in TG buffer formed with a gradient maker (Auto Densi-Flow IIC, Buchler Instruments) in a Polyallomer Centrifuge tube (Beckman no. 326819). After ultracentrifugation at 46,000 rpm in a SW50.1 rotor (Beckman) for 16 h at 4 °C, 13 0.4-ml fractions were collected from the top by using a Gilson FC205 fraction collector. For some experiments, trichloroacetic acid precipitation was used to precipitate total proteins before SDS-PAGE. 100% trichloroacetic acid was added to each fraction to final concentration 7.5%, and the samples were incubated on ice for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed with cold acetone, dried in a SpeedVac (Savant), and dissolved in 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing dithiothreitol and 3% β-mercaptoethanol. For immunoprecipitation in the absence of velocity centrifugation, cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation and washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation/MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford reagent (Pierce no. 1856209). Six μl of BPV αE5 antiserum, 4 μl of PDGF receptor antiserum B3a (designated here αPR) (which recognizes both full-length and truncated forms of the PDGF β receptor), 12–25 μl of αPLCγ (Santa Cruz, SC-81), 4 μl of αPI 3′-kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., 06-195), or 12–25 μl of RasGAP (Santa Cruz, SC-63) antibodies were added to 600, 300, 800–2500, 400, or 800–2500 μg of extracts, respectively. For immunoprecipitating samples from sucrose gradients, 12 μl of αE5, 8 μl of αPR, or 15 μl of human PDGF extracellular region mouse monoclonal antibody (αPRex) (R&D, 1263-00) were added to equal volumes of each fraction, typically 800–1200, 500–800, or 1000 μl, respectively. After incubation at 4 °C for 2–18 h, 3–5 μl of rabbit anti-mouse antiserum was added if the primary antibodies were monoclonal. Immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads and processed for electrophoresis as described (39.Lai C.C. Henningson C. DiMaio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15241-15246Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic separation, protein transfer, immunoblotting, and phosphatase treatment were carried out exactly as described previously (39.Lai C.C. Henningson C. DiMaio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15241-15246Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), except for E5 detection following sucrose gradient analysis, in which case ECL Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. For Western blotting of PDGF β receptor and PI 3-kinase from sucrose gradient fractions without precipitation, 15 and 10 μl of each fraction, respectively, were loaded on the gel directly. In some cases, filters were stripped of antibody and reprobed with a different antibody as described (39.Lai C.C. Henningson C. DiMaio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15241-15246Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To analyze the endogenous PDGF β receptor in C127 mouse fibroblasts transformed by the BPV E5 protein, cells were lysed in TG buffer, which contains 1% Triton X-100 to solubilize membranes. Extracts were layered onto a linear 5–25% sucrose gradient in TG buffer and subjected to velocity sedimentation. Fractions were collected and analyzed by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting. When a PDGF receptor-specific antibody was used to analyze total PDGF β receptor, as shown in the top panel of Fig.1, the great majority of PDGF β receptor sedimented slowly, with a peak in fractions 3–5. The peak of receptor isolated from untransformed, serum-starved C127 cells sedimented at the same position (data not shown), implying that the PDGF β receptor in these fractions represents inactive, monomeric receptor (Fig. 2, diagram A).Figure 2Diagram of PDGF β receptor complexes inferred to be present in E5-transformed cells. The vertical lines represent the full-length and truncated PDGF β receptor inserted into cell membranes.

Both the ∼200-kDa receptor species with mature carbohydrates and the ∼165-kDa precursor species with immature carbohydrates sedimented much more rapidly than monomeric receptor, in a broad distribution with a peak in fractions 9 and 10 (Fig. 1,bottom panel). There was virtually no tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF β receptor in untransformed cells in the absence of PDGF treatment, and PDGF treatment of these cells induced the appearance of mature tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF β receptor that sedimented more rapidly than the bulk receptor (data not shown; see also Fig. 3). Thus, the E5 protein caused a dramatic alteration in the physical properties of the murine PDGF β receptor, resulting in the far more rapid sedimentation of the activated species. The clear separation of the activated species from most of the receptor in E5-transformed cells demonstrated that the E5 protein activated only a small fraction of PDGF β receptor in transformed fibroblasts, and the shift to higher sedimentation rate suggested that the activated receptor is present in a much larger multiprotein complex. As described below and diagrammed schematically in Fig. 2 G, this species contains the E5 protein, dimeric PDGF β receptor, and associated signaling proteins. We also examined the sedimentation of the PDGF β receptor in murine Ba/F3 cells engineered to co-express the full-length wild-type human PDGF β receptor and the E5 protein. These cells do not express endogenous PDGF β receptor, and we previously showed that co-expression of the human PDGF β receptor and the E5 protein resulted in complex formation between these two proteins, receptor dimerization and activation, and growth factor-independent cell proliferation (28.Drummond-Barbosa D. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2570-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Goldstein D.J. Andresson T. Sparkowski J.J. Schlegel R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4851-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These experiments, in which we used an antibody to immunoprecipitate PDGF β receptor prior to Western blotting to provide further evidence that the bands detected were in fact PDGF β receptor, showed that most of the PDGF β receptor in these cells sedimented slowly with a peak in fraction 5, whereas both the mature and precursor tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor activated by the E5 protein sedimented rapidly with a peak in fractions 10–12 (data not shown). Thus, E5 expression caused a marked change in the physical behavior of the constitutively active murine as well as human PDGF β receptor, and in both cases only a small fraction of the total PDGF β receptor expressed in cells was activated. The sedimentation profile of the PDGF β receptor in response to PDGF treatment was also determined. Ba/F3 cells expressing the human PDGF β receptor without the E5 protein were treated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB or left untreated. This concentration of PDGF is sufficient to allow interleukin-3-independent proliferation of these cells. 2P. M. Irusta and D. DiMaio, unpublished results. Following detergent extraction and velocity sedimentation, total PDGF β receptor and tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor were detected by immunoblotting of each fraction. In the absence of PDGF treatment, total receptor sedimented with a peak in fraction 5, and there was no tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor (Fig. 3 A). Although PDGF treatment caused no change in the sedimentation pattern of the total PDGF receptor, it did induce the appearance of readily detectable tyrosine-phosphorylated mature PDGF β receptor, which sedimented with a peak in fraction 8 (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained if PDGF treatment was carried out at 4 °C (data not shown). Thus, under our conditions, PDGF treatment results in the activation of only a small fraction of the total PDGF β receptor in cells. However, only the mature, cell-surface form of the receptor is activated by PDGF treatment, and this activated receptor sediments more slowly than E5-activated receptor. We next analyzed Ba/F3 cells expressing a mutant human PDGF β receptor lacking most of its extracellular ligand-binding domain. The E5 protein can still bind and activate this truncated receptor via interactions involving the transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains of the receptor (39.Lai C.C. Henningson C. DiMaio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15241-15246Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We chose to examine this mutant because it is possible to separate phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the truncated receptor by gel electrophoresis (38.Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), as illustrated in the top panel of Fig.4. In cells not expressing the E5 protein, the truncated PDGF β receptor migrated as a single band in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (lane 1). Expression of the E5 protein caused a small fraction of the truncated receptor to migrate more slowly (lane 2), even though most of the receptor migrated at the same position as in cells not expressing the E5 protein. This slowly migrating species was tyrosine-phosphorylated (data not shown), and it was eliminated by phosphotyrosine phosphatase treatment (lane 3). This result implied that the E5 protein caused the tyrosine phosphorylation of only a small fraction of the PDGF β receptor, in agreement with the sedimentation analysis described above, and that this fraction can be directly visualized on the basis of its altered electrophoretic mobility. These two forms of the truncated PDGF β receptor and their interaction with the E5 protein were further analyzed in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 4, bottom panel). An antiserum recognizing the E5 protein failed to immunoprecipitate the PDGF β receptor from untransformed cells, as expected (lane 1). However, in cells expressing the E5 protein, the E5 antiserum co-immunoprecipitated both the slowly migrating tyrosine-phosphorylated species and the more rapidly migrating unphosphorylated species of the receptor in approximately equimolar amounts (lane 2). This result indicates that, even though the E5 protein activated only a small fraction of the total receptor in the cell, this activated fraction preferentially associated with the E5 protein. However, not all of the PDGF β receptor molecules associated with the E5 protein were tyrosine-phosphorylated. Detergent extracts were prepared from Ba/F3 cells expressing the truncated PDGF β receptor in the presence or absence of the E5 protein. Following velocity sedimentation, gradient fractions were analyzed for the presence of PDGF β receptor by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.5 (top panel), for cells not expressing the E5 protein, the truncated recep"

The role of the first Ig-like domain is not well understood, but it is required for optimal binding of IgE to FcεRI, either through a minor contact interaction or in a supporting structural capacity. The results reported here demonstrate that domain one of FcεRI plays a major structural role supporting the presentation of the ligand-binding site, by interactions generated within the interdomain interface. Analysis of a series of chimeric receptors and point mutants indicated that specific residues within the A′ strand of domain one are crucial to the maintenance of the interdomain interface, and IgE binding. Mutation of the Arg15 and Phe17 residues caused loss in ligand binding, and utilizing a homology model of FcεRI-α based on the solved structure of FcγRIIa, it appears likely that this decrease is brought about by collapse of the interface and consequently the IgE-binding site. In addition discrepancies in results of previous studies using chimeric IgE receptors comprising FcεRIα with either FcγRIIa or FcγRIIIA can be explained by the presence or absence of Arg15 and its influence on the IgE-binding site. The data presented here suggest that the second domain of FcεRI-α is the only domain involved in direct contact with the IgE ligand and that domain one has a structural function of great importance in maintaining the integrity of the interdomain interface and, through it, the ligand-binding site.

The α subunit, FcεRI-α, is the ligand-binding chain and is composed of two Ig-like domains. The role of the second domain has been clearly defined as containing the IgE-binding region. However, the role of the first domain is not clear in FcεRI nor indeed in any Fc receptor. Analyses to date have variously indicated that domain one is necessary for optimal binding (1.Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2.Robertson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12736-12743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Scarselli E. Esposito G.

Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 2.Robertson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12736-12743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural reasons for this are not apparent. FcεRI, however, is related to FcγRIIa, and the recent description of the three dimensional structure of FcγRIIa (6.Maxwell K.F. Powell M.S. Hulett M.D. Barton P.A. McKenzie I.F.C. Garrett T.P.J. Hogarth P.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), FcγRIIb (7.Sondermann P. Huber R. Jacob U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and FcεRI-α (8.Garman S.C. Kinet J.-P. Jardetzky T.S. Cell. 1998; 95: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) may provide a basis for the understanding of the roles of the individual domains in FcεRI and other Fc receptors. In the crystal structure of FcγRIIa the extracellular domains are “bent” to form an acute angle (52°) between domains 1 and 2. In this orientation, the IgG-binding site of domain 2 points away from the cell in such a manner as to be accessible to ligand, and domain 1 is angled away from the binding site and down toward the cell membrane. The acute angle is dictated by interactions within the interdomain interface, and the structural studies indicate that domain 1 is likely to support domain 2 providing an architectural role in the positioning of the binding site. Because FcεRI and FcγRIIa show 40% amino acid identity and considerably higher amino acid homology, it is probable that FcεRI has a similar structure to that of FcγRIIa, confirmed by the recent publication of the solved FcεRI structure (8.Garman S.C. Kinet J.-P. Jardetzky T.S. Cell. 1998; 95: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the study described herein we have utilized a model of FcεRI-α (see Fig. 1) based on the solved crystal structure of FcγRIIa (6.Maxwell K.F. Powell M.S. Hulett M.D. Barton P.A. McKenzie I.F.C. Garrett T.P.J. Hogarth P.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and undertaken a mutagenesis study of domain 1 to define its role in the interaction with IgE. The solved x-ray structure of FcεRI-α (8.Garman S.C. Kinet J.-P. Jardetzky T.S. Cell. 1998; 95: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) strongly resembles that of FcγRIIa and therefore that of the FcεRI-α homology model. Indeed, the FcεRI-α homology model and the x-ray structure of FcεRI-α, as described by Garman et al. (8.Garman S.C. Kinet J.-P. Jardetzky T.S. Cell. 1998; 95: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), show compelling concurrence in comparisons of structure and molecular interactions. Here, data from the chimeric Fc receptors and alanine mutants have been used together with molecular modeling to propose a functional structure of FcεRI-α. Two previously produced chimeric cDNA receptor constructs (1.Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were used as templates in the construction of this series of FcRs. The amino acid sequences of the chimeras and chimera nomenclature are displayed in Table I. The first template was designated εεγ and comprised domain one (D1)1 and domain two (D2) of FcεRI-α linked with the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic membrane anchor of FcγRIIa. The second chimeric template was based on a simple domain exchange and comprised D1 of FcγRIIa and D2 of FcεRI-α, also with the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic sequence of FcγRIIa, and was designated γεγ. Chimeric receptors were generated using the template receptor γεγ or εεγ. Specific loops, strands, or regions of the FcγRIIa D1 were replaced with the equivalent portion of FcεRI (or vice versa) to produce a series of chimeric receptors using splice overlap extension-polymerase chain reaction (SOE-PCR) using the method previously reported (9.Hogarth P.M. Ierino F.L. Hulett M.D. Immunomethods. 1994; 4: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A further template receptor was constructed with a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor of FcγRIIIB replacing the FcγRIIa cytoplasmic tail of the γεγ construct. This chimera was designated γεRIII and was generated by SOE-PCR. Substitution into domain one of the γεRIII template receptor of the A strand of FcεRI D1 produced the γ(Aε)εRIII chimera. The FcεRI D1 A′ strand point mutants, R15A and F17A, were made using SOE-PCR and incorporated into εεγ. The FcεRI D1 A′ strand point mutants N14A and R15L were constructed using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). cDNA was purified by centrifugation in a CsCl gradient (10.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 42-45Google Scholar), and the mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing.Table IAmino acid sequences of FcγRIIa, FcεRIα, hFcγRIIIA, and chimeric receptorsa indicates mutant clone nomenclature, initial character (γ or ε) designates the receptor of D1 origin (FcεRI and FcγRIIa); the portion in parentheses indicates the region exchanged (e.g. A′B loop) and its receptor of origin.

Human IgE (hIgE) (ATCC clone TIB196) was affinity purified over an anti-human IgE affinity column (ATCC clone HB121 purified supernatant, coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound IgE was eluted in 1-ml fractions with 0.5 m sodium citrate/0.5 m NaCl (pH 2.7) into tubes containing 50 μl 1m Tris (pH 9.0), buffer exchanged to phosphate-buffered saline (7.6 mm Na2HPO4/3.25 mm NaH2PO4/145 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) on a Sephadex G-25 PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and concentrated in a centrifugal concentrator (Macrosep, Filtron, Life Technologies, Inc.). High bind EIA/RIA plates (Costar 3690) were coated with 8 μg/ml of anti-human IgE mAb HB121 in phosphate-buffered saline overnight. The plates were blocked prior to the addition of serially diluted monoclonal IgE in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.5% bovine serum albumin (50 μl/well, 60 min). rsFcεRI 2Rigby, L.

Bound rsFcεRI was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 3B4, a nonblocking anti-human FcεRI mAb (1 μg/ml, 50 μl/well, 60 min). The assay was carried out at 20 °C, and the plates were washed seven times with water between each incubation step. Color development was witho-phenylenediamine (Sigma) and stopped after 15 min with 25 μl of 4 m sulfuric acid. The optical density was measured at 490 nm. COS-7 cells were maintained (1.Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transient transfection LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent was used, with plasmid DNA of interest, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The binding of IgE or IgG immune complexes to cells transfected with chimeric or mutant cDNA was determined by erythrocyte-antibody (EA) rosetting, which was assayed and scored according to the method previously reported (1.Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse anti-TNP IgE or IgG (moIgE or moIgG) was incubated with TNP-coated sheep red blood cells to form complexed IgE or IgG. These antibody sensitized erythrocytes were mixed with transfected cells, and the binding of these complexes to cells was determined microscopically (1.Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The utilization of avidity in this way permits the determination of low affinity binding. Equilibrium binding was determined by the method previously reported (1.Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). IgE was radioiodinated using IODO-GEN (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 125I disintegrations/min were determined separately for the cell pellets (bound IgE) and the supernatant (free IgE) in a WALLAC 1470 WIZARDTM automatic γ counter. Nonlinear regression analysis was performed by plotting IgE free versus IgE bound in the program “Curve Expert” using the formula for single site binding, y = (a *x)/(b + x); where y = IgE bound and x = free IgE. The equilibrium binding dissociation constant (K D) was obtained from three experiments with a correlation coefficient of >0.99 (see Table II). The maximum binding (B max) of IgE was also determined and used to estimate receptor expression.Table IIBinding and expression of chimeric and mutant receptors of the A strandA′B loop or G strand regions of D1moIgE EΛ rosetting (Avidity)aBinding of immune complexes.

Open table in a new tab COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with rFcεRI cDNA as above. Approximately 40 h post-transfection the COS-7 cells were incubated with saturating amounts of antibody, on ice, for 45 min; the cells were washed, resuspended in a 1:100 dilution of anti-mouse Ig F(ab′)2-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Silenus), and incubated for 30′ on ice. The cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% glucose, 3 μg/ml propidium iodide and analyzed in a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson). All washes and dilutions were in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% glucose. Analysis was conducted on live (propidium iodide negative) cells. Anti-human FcεRI-α monoclonal antibodies from hybridoma cell lines X52–47-5.4 (mAb47), X52–54.1 (mAb54), and 3B4 (mAb3B4), all mouse IgG1, were used to determine FcεR expression. These antibodies recognize separate epitopes: mAb 47, which recognizes an epitope in the G′ strand D2; mAb54, an epitope in the BC loop of D1; and mAb3B4, an epitope in the C′EF region of D1. Anti-human FcεRI-α mouse monoclonal antibody 15-1 was generously supplied by J.-P. Kinet. Anti-mouse FcγRI (IgG1) monoclonal allo-antibody from the hybridoma cell line X54–5/7.1 was kindly provided by Peck Szee Tan for use as an isotype control antibody. The anti-TNP mouse monoclonal antibodies were moIgE anti-TNP (ATCC clone TIB142) and moIgG1 anti-TNP (A3), and the latter was the gift of Dr. A. Lopez. The extracellular regions of the α-chain of the human Fcε receptor type I (FcεRI-α) and the human Fc γ Receptor type II a (FcγRIIa) show a sequence identity of about 40% for 172 residues (this consists of a sequence identity of about 45% for the first domain and about 36% for the second domain). FcγRIIa is the protein most homologous to FcεRI, for which the three-dimensional structure is known (6.Maxwell K.F. Powell M.S. Hulett M.D. Barton P.A. McKenzie I.F.C. Garrett T.P.J. Hogarth P.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). With the significant sequence identity, even higher sequence similarity, and the conservation of several important amino acid residues between the two proteins (see the sequence alignment given in Table I), clearly FcγRIIa is the most appropriate three-dimensional structural template to use in modeling FcεRI, more suitable than the structures of CD2 or CD4, which have been used in the past to construct models of FcεRI (12.Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 13.Hogarth P.M. Hulett M.D. Ierino F.L. Tate B. Powell M.S. Brinkworth R.I. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 125: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The recently solved crystal structure of FcεRI (8.Garman S.C. Kinet J.-P. Jardetzky T.S. Cell. 1998; 95: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) confirmed the similarity of the two structures, including the C2 sub type of the Ig-like domains and the acute angle between the two domains. However, the cartesian coordinates of the crystal structure of FcεRI were not available, and therefore we made use of the homology model of FcεRI built in this work. Modeler (14.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) as implemented in the InsightII_Homology software package (Insight II (97.0), Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) was used to build three-dimensional models of FcεRI-α using a number of different initial sequence alignments and two structural templates of FcγRIIa. One of the structural templates was the three-dimensional coordinates of FcγRIIa where for the residues that had alternative side chain conformations (residue numbers 10, 21, 33, 57, 60, 61, 65, and 89) the conformations labeled A were selected, whereas in the other template the conformations labeled B were selected. In each Modeler run, five structural models of FcεRI-α were generated. The following parameter values or options were used: library_schedule of 1, max_var_iterations of 300, md_level of refine1′, repeat_optimization of 3, and max_molpdf of 106. The best model from these runs had the sequence alignment given in Table I and used the structural template of FcγRIIa where residues 10, 21, 33, 57, 60, 61, 65, and 89 had side chains in the A conformation. The criteria for judging the best model included the lowest value of the Modeler objective function (or −1.0 × ln (molecular probability density function), well behaved ProsaII (15.Sippl M. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar) residue energy plot for the model (for example, negative residue energy scores throughout the sequence), and well behaved Profiles-3D (16.Bowie J.U. Luthy R. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 253: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar) local 3D-1D compatibility score plot (for example, positive plot scores throughout the sequence). Next, Modeler was used to generate 20 different structural models of FcεRI-α using the sequence alignment and template selected above and using the parameter values and options listed above. From these, the model with the lowest − ln (molecular probability density function) value was then further improved (as measured by ProsaII, Profiles-3D, and Procheck (17.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar)) by being selected as the template to generate structural models of the FcεRI-α sequence in the next cycle of Modeler runs. At the end of four such cycles, the best three-dimensional model of the FcεRI-α structure (i.e.the model with the lowest value of the Modeler objective function) was selected as the final structural model of the FcεRI-α monomer. Secondary structure prediction performed on FcεRI-α sequence confirmed the validity of the alignment given in Table I and showed the pattern of β strands is the same in both FcεRI-α and FcγRIIa. The secondary structure prediction methods used were PHD (18.Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 266-275Google Scholar) and PREDATOR (19.Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1997; 27: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The model is displayed in Fig.1. The R15A and the F17A point mutants of FcεRI-α were modeled from the above FcεRI-α model by mutating the R15 and F17 residues to alanines with InsightII_Homology module (MSI), adding hydrogens to the two models, and energy minimizing the structures, keeping all heavy atoms fixed except for the Ala15 and Ala17 residues, respectively. The program Discover v. 2.98 (MSI) was used for the energy minimization with the CFF91 force field and a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 1.0xr, and the minimization was done with the conjugate gradients method until the maximum energy gradient was less than 0.01 kcal/Å. Three chimera structures of FcεRI that were experimentally constructed and the binding to IgE investigated were modeled based on the structural template of FcγRIIa. The sequences of these three chimera, labeled γεγ, γ(A′Bε)εγ, and ε(A′Bγ)εγ, respectively, are shown in Table I. The same sequence alignment as shown in Table I and the same Modeler parameter values and options as were used to generate the model of FcεRI-α (as described earlier) were used to construct these chimera models. Again, out of 20 models generated for each chimera, the model with the lowest Modeler objective function was selected, and the model structure was validated with ProsaII, Profiles-3D, and Procheck. Finally the electrostatic potential was calculated and mapped onto the molecular surface (Fig. 2) of the constructed FcεRI-α model using the program GRASP (20.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Gent. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). The PARSE3 (21.Sitkoff D. Sharp K.A. Honig B. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 1978-1988Crossref Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) charge set was used in computing the electrostatic potential. It can be seen that one face of FcεRI-α has a considerably more negative electrostatic potential than the other face.Figure 2FcεRI-α homology model with electrostatic potential displayed. The electrostatic potential of FcεRI-α model was calculated and mapped onto the molecular surface, with red indicating a negative, andblue indicating a positive electrostatic potential. It can be seen that the face of FcεRI-α comprising the C/F/G strands of domain 1 and domain 2 (A) has a considerably more negative electrostatic potential than the face comprising the A/B/E strands of domain 1 and domain 2 (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The co-ordinates of the FcεRI-α model are available on request. Examination of the FcεRI-α homology model (shown in Fig. 1 and fully described below) and the model of the γεγ chimera indicates that the two major regions of D1 that impinge on the D1/D2 interface are, first, the A strand, A′ strand, and A′B loop, and second, the G strand. Utilizing a chimeric FcR (γεγ) comprising FcγRIIa D1 and FcεRI D2 (IgE-binding domain), those segments that form part of the D1/D2 interface of D1 FcγRIIa cDNA were replaced with the equivalent portion of FcεRI cDNA (Table I). The receptors were assayed to determine which segments conferred a gain of function. Four chimeric receptors were constructed that encompassed the A′ strand A′B loop region, namely, γ(ABCε)εγ, γ(ABCC′ε)εγ, γ(AA′Bε)εγ, and γ(A′Bε)εγ. Analysis of the transfected receptors by EA rosetting (1.Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) indicated, surprisingly, that none of these chimeric receptors bound complexed moIgE as IgE-coated erythrocytes; as expected, none bound moIgG. To determine whether the receptors were expressed on the cell surface, the chimeras were tested by flow cytometry, using a panel of four anti-FcεRI-α mAbs that recognized separate nonoverlapping epitopes, two (mAb3B4 and mAb54) in D1 and two (mAb47 and mAb15-1) in D2.2 Two of the four chimeras tested, γ(ABCε)εγ and γ(ABCC′ε)εγ, were not detected on the cell surface and thus were assumed not to be expressed. However, the γ(AA′Bε)εγ and γ(A′Bε)εγ chimeras were detected on the cell surface by mAb and were then tested for their ability to bind monomeric hIgE in an equilibrium binding assay (Table II). Both chimeras failed to bind monomeric hIgE, which is consistent with their failure to bind moIgE complexes (Table II). Thus, despite the fact that these interface sequences were derived from FcεRI, the chimeras were not able to bind IgE. The γ(AA′Bε)εγ (FcεRI residues 1–21) and γ(A′Bε)εγ (FcεRI residues 14–21) chimeras differ only by the inclusion or absence of the FcεRI A strand of D1 (FcεRI residues 1–10), and although these chimeras were detected on the cell surface by mAb47 (which maps to an epitope in D2 near the transmembrane region), they were not detected by mAb15-1, an antibody previously reported to detect an epitope in D2 within the IgE-binding site (22.Wang B. Rieger A. Kilgus O. Ochiai K. Maurer D. Födinger D. Kinet J.-P. Stingl G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1353-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thus, although the receptors were expressed, they were incapable of binding monomeric hIgE or moIgE complexes, implying significant disruption to the IgE-binding site. This disruption is most probably caused by the segment that is common to both receptor chimeras, that of the A′ strand, A′B loop (FcεRI residues 14–21), rather than the A strand, which is present only in the γ(AA′Bε)εγ chimera. In the structure of FcγRIIa and the model of FcεRI, the cis-Pro11 at the start of the A′ strand, is essential for maintaining the conformation of this part of the interdomain interface. This would imply that the A strand segment up until the cis-Pro has little impact on the interdomain interface and was probably not involved in the disruption to IgE binding, as would be expected from the structure. This was confirmed by testing a chimera with only the A strand segment from the N terminus to the cis-Pro11 from FcεRI in D1 FcγRIIa, namely γ(Aε)εRIII. This A strand chimera bound hIgE with an affinity approaching that of εεγ (Table II) and is discussed below. Evidently the loss of IgE binding function was related to the alteration of sequences in the interdomain interface, which implies a major role in IgE binding by domain 1. Furthermore, even though these sequences are derived from the same receptor as the IgE binding second domain, they do not provide the correct interactions unless in the context of an autologous first domain. Thus, it may be expected that IgE binding is dependent upon the A′ strand-A′B loop segment. To confirm that this change of function was directly related to the A′ strand-A′B segment and its impact on the D1/D2 interface, an additional chimera was created. This new chimera was constructed using FcεRI-α (εεγ) as the template, (rather than γεγ) in which the A′B strands and loop of FcγRIIa D1 were inserted into the"
