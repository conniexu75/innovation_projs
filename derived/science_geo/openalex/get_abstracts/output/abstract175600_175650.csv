Hydroxylation of specific prolyl residues by 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent oxygenases mediates ubiquitinylation and proteasomal destruction of HIF-α. Hydroxylation of an asparagine residue in the C-terminal transactivation domain (CAD) of HIF-α abrogates interaction with p300, preventing transcriptional activation. Yeast two-hybrid assays recently identified factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) as a protein that associates with the CAD region of HIF-α. Since FIH contains certain motifs present in iron- and 2-OG-dependent oxygenases we investigated whether FIH was the HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase. Assays using recombinant FIH and HIF-α fragments revealed that FIH is the enzyme that hydroxylates the CAD asparagine residue, that the activity is directly inhibited by cobalt(II) and limited by hypoxia, and that the oxygen in the alcohol of the hydroxyasparagine residue is directly derived from dioxygen. Sequence analyses involving FIH link the 2-OG oxygenases with members of the cupin superfamily, including Zn(II)-utilizing phosphomannose isomerase, revealing structural and evolutionary links between these metal-binding proteins that share common motifs.

HIF is a heterodimer of α- and β-subunits with regulation by dioxygen availability being mediated by post-translational modification of the α-subunits (1Semenza G.L.

In mammalian cells, two HIF-α subunit isoforms (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) are regulated by dioxygen levels. Each HIF-α protein contains an internal oxygen-dependent degradation domain possessing targeting motifs for proteolytic regulation and a C-terminal transactivation domain (CAD) independently regulated by dioxygen, irrespective of changes in protein abundance, through interaction with the CH1 domain of the co-activator p300 (for review, see Ref. 3Wenger R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF-α by proteolysis is regulated by the hydroxylation of specific prolyl residues (Pro-402 and Pro-564 in human HIF-1α) that mediate recognition of HIF-α by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitinylation complex and consequent proteasomal destruction (4Ivan M.

Combined structural analysis and genetic approaches led to the identification of three isoforms of human HIF prolyl hydroxylase (PHD1–3, prolylhydroxylase domain) together with homologues in a range of organisms (8Epstein A.C.R.

In vitro analyses together with sequence and mutational analyses identified these as belonging to a subfamily of the Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent oxygenases (4Ivan M. Kondo K.

Limiting oxygen availability in hypoxia, or direct inhibition of the PHD enzymes by cobaltous ions and iron chelators, allows HIF-α to escape hydroxylation and recognition by pVHL, providing insights into the mechanism by which these stimuli suppress HIF-α degradation and activate the transcriptional cascade (8Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W.

Previous analyses of the HIF-α CAD have indicated that, as with proteolysis, the action of hypoxia is clearly mimicked by cobaltous ions and iron chelators, suggesting the operation of a related regulatory process (10Jiang B.H.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2984-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, sequence similarities between the HIF-α CAD and the prolyl-containing motifs in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain are not apparent. Insight into this paradox has been provided by mass spectrometric and mutational analyses of the HIF-α CAD that demonstrate regulatory hydroxylation of a specific asparaginyl residue (Asn-803 in HIF-1α) (14Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). In the presence of oxygen, hydroxylation at this site prevents interaction with the p300 CH1 domain, whereas in hypoxia suppression of the modification allows interaction with p300 and transcriptional activation. Consistent with this model, NMR studies of the human HIF-1α CAD complexed to CH1 indicate that the unmodified Asn-803 is buried at the interface between the proteins (15Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M., De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 16Freedman S.J. Sun Z.-Y.J. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The dependence of the asparaginyl-modifying activity on iron and inhibition by a 2-OG analogue implied that the HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase was a member of the same oxygenase family as the PHD isozymes, although the enzyme was not identified. Recent studies have identified factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) as a protein interacting with the CAD of HIF and which is involved in preventing the transcriptional activation role of CAD (17Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that FIH is the oxygenase catalyzing hydroxylation of Asn-803 in HIF-1α and report on the characterization of recombinant enzyme. Our findings provide further evidence for the importance of this class of enzyme in mediating cellular responses to oxygen availability. They also establish an evolutionarily relevant structural relationship that links the Fe(II)-dependent family of 2-OG and related oxygenases with the cupin superfamily. Thefih gene was PCR-amplified from Image clone 4138066 and subcloned as an NdeI/BamHI fragment into the pET28a(+) vector (Novagen) to generate an N-terminal His6-tagged FIH fusion protein. Primers used were: forward, 5′-gggaattccatatggcggcgacagcggcg-3′; reverse, 5′-cgcggatccctagttgtatcggccc-3′. Following amplification the integrity of fih was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Thefih/pET28a(+) construct was transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) and grown at 37 °C in 2TY medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The N-terminal His6-tagged FIH fusion protein was purified using nickel affinity chromatography (Novagen), and the N-terminal His6tag was removed from FIH by cleavage with thrombin. Size exclusion chromatography (Superdex S75) yielded FIH of >95% purity by SDS-PAGE analysis. Electrospray ionization MS revealed that the mass of the isolated FIH was consistent with that expected from its predicted amino acid sequence (observed, 40,556 Da; calculated, 40,567 Da). The desired segments of human HIF-1α were cloned directly as SacII/AscI fragments from pcDNA3 vectors (12O'Rourke J.F. Tian Y.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. J. Biol.

The constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and grown at 37 °C in 2TY medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The GST-tagged fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-SepharoseTM 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). The GST tag was removed from the HIF-1α fragments when required by PreScissionTM Protease treatment. Size exclusion chromatography (Superdex S75) yielded >95% pure protein by SDS-PAGE analysis. His6-tagged sections of HIF-1α were prepared as described in Ref. 8Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M.

Mutant GST-HIF-1α-(775–826) isoenzymes were produced from the wild-type construct using the QuikChange system (Stratagene).

Bold codons indicate mutations. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Assays for decarboxylation of 2-OG were performed using radiolabeled 2-OG (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as reported in Ref. 8Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R.

Incubations contained ascorbate, dithiothreitol, catalase, 2-OG, FIH, and substrate in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 and were carried out at 37 °C typically for 20 min. HPLC separations were achieved on a Phenomenex Jupiter C4 (15-cm × 4.6-mm) column by using a linear gradient of CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. For inhibition and metal dependence assays, GST-HIF-1α-(775–826) was used as substrate at 30 μm and with iron(II) ammonium sulfate, cobalt(II) chloride, zinc(II) chloride, and N-oxaloylglycine at final concentrations of 0, 2,10, 40, 80, and 200 μm. Assays under an atmosphere of 18O2 were performed as reported previously (18McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. Gleadle J. Horsfall L.E. Oldham N.J. Maxwell P. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To examine for effects of FIH on HIF-1α binding to p300, the GST fusion protein expressing amino acids of HIF-1α-(775–826) and the N803A mutant were exposed to recombinant FIH under conditions designed to promote the hydroxylation.N-Oxaloylglycine was added to 5 mm when required. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were added for 40 min at 25 °C and then washed with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The beads bearing the treated GST-HIF fusion proteins were mixed with35S-labeled CH1-p300 (pCMX-GAL4-CH1 encoding amino acids 300–528 of p300) produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Binding was performed for 1 h at 25 °C, and the beads were then washed in the same buffer. The bound proteins were eluted in SDS running buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Preliminary analysis of the predicted FIH amino acid sequence in light of the sequences for 2-OG oxygenases of known structure and function (19Que L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 20Ryle M.J. Hausinger R.P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-8Crossref Google Scholar) suggested that FIH contained the conserved HX(D/E). . . . . H “facial triad” of residues that binds the Fe(II) cofactor. Given the reported interaction of FIH with the CAD of HIF-1α and its ability to down-regulate transactivation we considered that FIH might function as the Asn-803 hydroxylase. N-terminally His6-tagged FIH was therefore produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified to >95% purity. HIF-1α polypeptides encompassing all three identified sites of hydroxylation were then examined as putative substrates for purified recombinant FIH (Table I, entries 1–6) using an assay that monitors decarboxylation of 2-OG. The results clearly indicate that there was no FIH-mediated hydroxylation of those HIF fragments previously shown to be substrates for the PHD isozymes, thereby implying that FIH is not a HIF prolyl hydroxylase (Table I, entries 4–6). In contrast, CO2 production was strikingly stimulated in the presence of HIF-1α fragments containing the CAD (Table I, entries 1–3). Both GST-fused and free forms of a polypeptide encompassing the human HIF-1α CAD (residues 775–826) were observed to cause significant stimulation of FIH-mediated 2-OG turnover. A high ratio (>10:1) of prime substrate coupled:uncoupled 2-OG turnover was observed in the case of the free 775–826 substrate, and preliminary kinetic parameters for this peptide obtained using the 2-OG turnover assay were K m (peptide) = 10 μm, K m (2-OG) = 10 μm, and V max = 0.3μmol/min/mg.Table ISubstrate selectivity of FIH with HIF-1α polypeptidesEntrySubstrateCO2 releasedActivity relative to 775–826 peptide nmol %1HIF-1α-(775–826)2.81002GST-HIF-1α-(775–826)2.7963GST-HIF-1α-(577–826)0.81674GST-HIF-1α-(530–652)0.051.85His6-HIF-1α-(344–503)<0.001<0.016His6-HIF-1α-(530–698)<0.001<0.017GST-HIF-1α-(775–826) N803D0.2278GST-HIF-1α-(775–826) N803A<0.001<0.019GST-HIF-1α-(775–826) N803E<0.001<0.0110GST-HIF-1α-(775–826) N803Q<0.001<0.01FIH was incubated with proteins containing the three known hydroxylation sites (Pro-402, Pro-564, and Asn-803) in HIF-1α (4Ivan M.

Column 4 shows the activity of each substrate relative to the activity of 775–826 peptide as a substrate under the same conditions. See “Experimental Procedures” for assay details. Since the 2-OG turnover assay does not directly measure oxidation of the prime substrate, unequivocal demonstration of FIH-mediated hydroxylation was sought from mass spectrometric analyses. Using HIF-1α-(775–826) peptide as a substrate under normoxic conditions, an increase in mass of 16 Da was observed after HPLC isolation of product (Fig. 1 a, panels a and b). The results demonstrate that FIH is a 2-OG-dependent hydroxylase that modifies the HIF-1α CAD. To test whether this activity regulates the interaction with the p300 co-activator, GST-fused HIF-1α CAD was exposed to purified recombinant FIH under conditions that support decarboxylation of 2-OG, purified, and assayed for the ability to interact with35S-labeled CH1 by GST pull-down assay. Fig. 1 bshows that pretreatment with FIH greatly reduced the ability of the HIF-1α CAD polypeptide to interact with CH1 (compare lanes 1 and 2). Following previous MS/MS assignment of Asn-803 as the modified residue in the HIF-1α CAD (14Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar), we constructed a series a mutations at this site and performed further 2-OG decarboxylation and interaction assays using the mutant polypeptides. Mutation of Asn-803 in GST-HIF-1α-(775–826) to alanine abolished all activity in the 2-OG decarboxylation assay (Table I, entries 8–10) and prevented modulation of CH1 binding in the interaction assay (Fig. 1 b,lanes 4 and 5). Mutation to glutamine and glutamate also abolished activity, while an Asp-803 mutant still supported some 2-OG turnover but only at a maximum of 7% of the analogous Asn-803 substrate (Table I, entry 7). Taken together these results demonstrate that FIH is the dioxygen-requiring Asn-803 hydroxylase that controls HIF-α C-terminal transactivation by regulating the interaction with the CH1 domain of p300. The clear preference of FIH for an asparaginyl rather than an aspartyl residue as substrate contrasts with the previously reported human Asp/Asn hydroxylase that catalyzes hydroxylation at the β-carbon of both aspartyl and asparaginyl residues (22Wang Q.P. Vandusen W.J. Petroski C.J. Garsky V.M. Stern A.M. Friedman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14004-14010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation raises the possibility that FIH-mediated hydroxylation does not occur at the β-carbon of Asn-803 but at another atom. Oxidation of either the α-carbon or the carbonyl oxygen of the primary amide seems unlikely given the relative lack of activity of the Asp-803 and other mutants and likely instability of the putative products. It is possible that nitrogen of the primary amide is hydroxylated to give a hydroxamic acid (CH2CONHOH). The available NMR data suggest that like β-hydroxylation, such a modification would be disruptive to the interaction between CAD and p300 (15Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M., De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanism of FIH and its relationship to the characteristics ofin vivo HIF activation, in vitro analyses of FIH using the purified recombinant protein were performed. Analyses revealed that the purified recombinant FIH contained ∼1 metal ion per protein, consistent with the operation of a mono-iron catalytic site. 2J. M. Elkins, K. S. Hewitson, L. A. McNeill, and C. J. Schofield, unpublished data. FIH was inhibited byN-oxaloylglycine, a known inhibitor of the PHD isozymes and other 2-OG oxygenases, both in bioassays of CH1 capture by HIF-1α CAD (Fig. 1 b, compare lanes 2 and 3) andin vitro kinetic assays (IC50, 25 μm). Cobalt(II) also inhibited recombinant FIH activity (IC50, 10 μm), explaining the ability of these substances to regulate HIF-1α CAD activity (13Sang N. Fang J. Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2984-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly addition of exogenous iron(II) to the purified FIH/HIF-1α CAD assay produced no further increase in activity, implying relatively tight metal binding by FIH. This may reflect the ability of the hydroxylated asparagine product to chelate iron. Because of the relationship of FIH to the zinc(II)-binding proteins from the cupin family (see below) we also tested the action of zinc(II) and found similar inhibition to that with cobalt(II) (IC50, 10 μm). Although zinc(II) does not induce a HIF transcriptional response, recent studies have demonstrated that it does stabilize HIF-1α but blocks transactivation by inducing alternative splicing to a shortened form that lacks the CAD (23Chun Y.S. Choi E.J. Yeo E.J. Lee J.H. Kim M.S. Park J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4051-4061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the physiological relevance of these findings is still unclear, it therefore seems likely that zinc(II) inhibits both FIH and the PHD enzymes. The requirement of FIH for dioxygen as a co-substrate indicates that, like the PHD isozymes, FIH may act as a cellular oxygen sensor. Indeed, when assayed under conditions of graded reduction of atmospheric oxygen (8Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar), FIH demonstrated large and progressive reductions in HIF-1α CAD-linked 2-OG decarboxylation below ∼5% O2. This suggests that, as for PHD1, activity is limited by oxygen concentrations in the physiological range. To explore further the interaction with dioxygen, the origin of the incorporated oxygen atom in the product was investigated by incubation under an atmosphere of18O2 gas followed by mass spectrometric analysis. The results reveal the source of the oxygen in the hydroxylated product to be >98% derived from dioxygen (Fig.1 a, panel c), demonstrating a direct interaction between FIH and dioxygen as shown for PHD1 and procollagen prolyl hydroxylase (18McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. Gleadle J. Horsfall L.E. Oldham N.J. Maxwell P. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Wu M. Begley T.P. Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Bioorg. Chem. 2000; 28: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These results contrast with similar incorporation experiments with microbial 2-OG oxygenases where incorporation of oxygen from water as well as dioxygen is observed. The exchange process has been proposed to occur via binding of water to a pentacoordinate ferryl species (Fe(IV)=O ↔ Fe(III)–O⋅) (25Zhang Z. Ren J.-s. Harlos K. McKinnon C.H. Clifton I.J. Schofield C.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the case of FIH and PHD1, it may be that the presence of a large peptide substrate at the active site blocks access of water, thereby preventing exchange. The involvement of an additional member of the 2-OG oxygenase superfamily, distinct from the PHD isozymes, in the regulation of HIF transactivation raises several biological issues. First it defines another link between the availability of dioxygen and HIF activity that may help shape the physiological characteristics of the transcriptional response to hypoxia. Second it provides an explanation for the characteristic action of cobalt in mimicking the effect of hypoxia on both the isolated degradation and activation domains of HIF-α subunits. Third it provides a further target for the development of therapeutic agents that augment HIF activity in ischemia/hypoxic disease. Fourth the reported interactions of FIH with both histone deacetylases and pVHL (17Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar) suggest that these proteins may be involved in additional oxygen-regulated processes that affect the HIF transcriptional response or other pathways. Our findings also raise interesting structural and evolutionary issues with respect to the 2-OG oxygenases and related enzymes. Sequence comparisons reveal that FIH, like the PHD isozymes, utilizes a 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad formed from a conserved HX(D/E). . . . . H motif as found in other 2-OG oxygenases (19Que L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Together with crystallographic insights and secondary structure predictions, the analyses imply that FIH possesses the jellyroll β-sheet core (double-stranded β-helix) common to other 2-OG oxygenases. They also reveal that FIH possesses a ∼40-residue insert between β-strands 4 and 5 of the eight-stranded jellyroll motif (Fig.2 a) and suggest that the structure of the FIH will be significantly different from the PHD isozymes, which are closely related to one another. Although kinetic analyses clearly demonstrate a requirement of FIH for 2-OG, an unusual feature of FIH concerns the identity of residues involved in binding the 5-carboxylate of 2-OG. The analyses imply that FIH does not possess the arginine or lysine residue, located on β-strand 8 of the jellyroll, that is involved in binding the 2-OG 5-carboxylate present in the PHDs and many other 2-OG oxygenases (Fig.2 a). Thus, FIH probably constitutes the first member of a new structural subfamily of 2-OG oxygenases, and the development of inhibitors selective for FIH versus the PHD isozymes or vice versa should be possible. Mahon et al. (17Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar) used BLAST searches to identify proteins with regions of sequence similarity to FIH. One of these regions (GenBankTM accession number AF168362.1) is a JmjC homology region, present in the jumonji transcription factors, which have been identified as members of the cupin structural superfamily (26Clissold P.M. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The identification of FIH as an Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase inhibited by Zn(II) prompted us to compare crystal structures from the 2-OG and cupin superfamilies. These analyses revealed a striking similarity between the cores of the 2-OG oxygenases, exemplified by clavaminic acid synthase (CAS1), 3Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Databank code 1DRY. and the cupin superfamily, exemplified by phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) 4Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Databank code 1PMI.

Arabidopsis stomata are produced by asymmetric cell divisions. Mutations in the gene TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) disrupt patterning by randomizing the plane of formative asymmetric divisions and by permitting ectopic divisions. TMM encodes a leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor-like protein expressed in proliferative postprotodermal cells. TMM appears to function in a position-dependent signaling pathway that controls the plane of patterning divisions as well as the balance between stem cell renewal and differentiation in stomatal and epidermal development.

About one-third of single neurons recorded in the anterior cingulate cortex of monkeys during these reward schedules had responses that progressively changed strength with reward expectancy, an effect that disappeared when the cue was random. Alterations of this progression could be the basis for the changes from normal that are reported in anterior cingulate population activity for obsessive-compulsive disorder and drug abuse, conditions characterized by disturbances in reward expectancy."

The decreased p27Kip1 expression allows cyclin-dependent kinase activity to cause cells to enter into S phase and correlates with poor patient survival. Inhibition of serine/threonine kinase Akt signaling by some pharmacological agents or by PTEN induces G1 arrest, in part by up-regulating p27Kip1. However, the role of Akt-dependent phosphorylation in p27Kip1 regulation is not clear. Here, we show that Akt bound directly to and phosphorylated p27Kip1. Screening p27Kip1 phosphorylation sites identified the COOH-terminal Thr198 residue as a novel site. Further analysis revealed that 14-3-3 proteins bound to p27Kip1 through Thr198 only when it was phosphorylated by Akt. Although Akt also phosphorylated p27Kip1 at Ser10 and Thr187, these two sites were not involved in the binding to 14-3-3 proteins. p27Kip1 phosphorylated at Thr198 exists only in the cytoplasm.

J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). After stimulation with growth factors, Akt is recruited to the plasma membrane and binds to the phosphatidylinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K)1-generated phospholipid second messenger molecule, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), through its pleckstrin homology domain (1Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 2Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Then, Akt is phosphorylated at two key regulatory sites, Thr308 and Ser473. Phosphorylation at both residues is necessary for full activation of Akt and the subsequent regulation of many biological responses, including glucose uptake, protein synthesis, and apoptosis inhibition (3Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 is catalyzed by the ubiquitously expressed 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) (reviewed in Ref. 4Alessi D.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 is called PDK2. Recently, several reports suggested that Akt itself, integrin-linked kinase, or PDK1 complexed with the fragment of PRK2 (protein kinase C-related kinase-2) is associated with the Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 (5Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 6Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). A number of molecules play an important role in regulating cell-cycle progression. Cell-cycle progression depends on the activity of kinase complexes composed of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The CDK activity is suppressed in part by association with CDK inhibitors, including the INK4 family (p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d) and the Cip/Kip family (p21Waf1/Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2) (reviewed in Ref. 8Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). p27Kip1, a Cip/Kip member, was identified as a CDK inhibitor that causes G1 arrest by inhibiting the activities of G1cyclins/CDKs. The activity of p27Kip1 is controlled by its concentration, its distribution among different cellular complexes, and its cellular localization (9Ekholm S.V. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 10Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In many human cancers, reduced p27Kip1 expression is frequently observed (10Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The reduced expression of p27Kip1 is reported to correlate with tumor progression and poor patient survival (11Mori M. Mimori K. Shiraishi T. Tanaka S. Ueo H. Sugimachi K. Akiyoshi T. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 593Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 12Catzavelos C. Bhattacharya N. Ung Y.C. Wilson J.A. Roncari L. Sandhu C. Shaw P. Yeger H. Morava-Protzner I. Kapusta L. Franssen E. Pritchard K.I. Slingerland J.M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Thus, p27Kip1 may participate in tumor suppression by inhibiting abnormal cell-cycle progression. The concentration of p27Kip1 is transcriptionally and post-translationally regulated. Akt is known to down-regulate p27Kip1 transcription by phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of the Forkhead family of transcription factors (13Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). However, the p27Kip1concentration is reported to be mainly regulated by post-translational mechanisms (14Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 15Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Thr187 by the cyclin E-CDK2 complex triggers p27Kip1 degradation (16Muller D. Bouchard C.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Although p27Kip1needs to be transported into the nucleus to exert CDK inhibitory action, phosphorylation at Ser10 by unknown kinases was recently reported to increase nuclear export of p27Kip1through binding to CRM1 (20Ishida N. Hara T. Kamura T. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14355-14358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, some kinases regulate degradation and cytoplasmic localization p27Kip1 through phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN(phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome 10) is mutated in a wide range of human cancers.PTEN encodes a lipid phosphatase that removes thed-3-phosphate from PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (21Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss or mutation of PTEN increases the amount of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which in turn activates pleckstrin homology domain-containing Akt. PTEN induces growth arrest in part by up-regulating p27Kip1 (22Li D.M. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K activity by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 results in G1arrest with p27Kip1 up-regulation (23Collado M. Medema R.H. Garcia-Cao I. Dubuisson M.L. Barradas M. Glassford J. Rivas C. Burgering B.M. Serrano M. Lam E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21960-21968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus, Akt might be involved in the down-regulation of p27Kip1 expression. Although Akt transcriptionally regulates p27Kip1 expression by phosphorylating and inhibiting Forkhead transcription factors (13Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), the post-translational regulation of p27Kip1 expression remains unclear. We sought to determine the Akt-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of p27Kip1. We found that Akt directly phosphorylated p27Kip1 in vivo and in vitro. Mutation and immunoblot analyses revealed that Akt phosphorylated p27Kip1 at the previously identified Ser10 and Thr187 residues. Furthermore, we identified the COOH-terminal Thr198 residue as a novel Akt-dependent phosphorylation site. Screening of the p27Kip1-binding protein identified that 14-3-3 proteins bound to p27Kip1 only when p27Kip1 was phosphorylated at Thr198 by Akt. Because Thr198-phosphorylated p27Kip1 was localized only in the cytoplasm, Akt might promote 14-3-3 binding to p27Kip1 by phosphorylation at Thr198, allowing its cytoplasmic localization and degradation. The recombinant human inactive Akt1, active Akt1, and active CDK2/cyclin A proteins were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). LY294002 was purchased from Sigma. Our previously identified PDK1 inhibitor UCN-01 was kindly provided by Kyowa Hakko Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan) (24Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T.

The PCR products were cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen). The translation initiation codon ATG in WTp27kip1 was converted to the isoleucine codon ATC by PCR-based mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Substitution of Ser138, Thr157, or Gln186 with stop codons in WT p27kip1 to generate the COOH-terminal deletion mutants (137STOP-p27Kip1, 156STOP-p27Kip1, and 185STOP-p27Kip1, respectively) was accomplished by converting the appropriate codons to the stop codon TAG. Substitution of Ser10, Thr157, Thr187, or Thr198 with Ala or Asp in WT p27kip1 was accomplished using the PCR-based mutagenesis kit. The double- and triple-point mutants were established by further PCR mutagenesis. WT p27kip1 and these p27kip1 mutants were then subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector or the pQBI50-fC vector (Wako Bioproducts, Richmond, VA).

The PCR products were cloned into the pCRII vector. Substitutions of both Arg56 and Arg60 with Ala (R56A/R60A) in 14-3-3θ were accomplished by converting the Arg codon AGG to the Ala codon GCG using the PCR-based mutagenesis kit. Before subcloning, they were used as templates in a double-stranded Sequenase reaction. All plasmid DNAs for transfection were purified using a QIAGEN plasmid maxi kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected with appropriate plasmids using Superfect transfection reagent (QIAGEN Inc.) or LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (25Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In some experiments, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated using an NE-PER extraction kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blot analysis, we used the following: an antibody to phospho-Akt (Thr308) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), antibodies to Akt or phospho-Ser/Thr Akt substrate (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), an antibody to p27Kip1 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), an antibody to phospho-p27Kip1(Thr187) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), an antibody to a V5 tag (Invitrogen), an antibody to a blue fluorescence protein tag (clone 11E5, Wako Bioproducts), an antibody to a hemagglutinin (HA) tag (clone 3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or an antibody to a FLAG tag (clone M2, Sigma). Subsequently, membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. After washing several times, the membranes were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 293T cells were transfected with the pFLAG-CMV-2 empty vector or the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector encoding WT 14-3-3θ or mutant R56A/R60A 14-3-3θ. After transfection for 24 h, transfectants were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 137 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmaprotinin) for immunoprecipitation. The cell lysates were precleared by incubation with avidin-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, precleared lysates were mixed with 10 μm biotinylated peptides and incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. To precipitate the peptides, the reactions were incubated with avidin-conjugated agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged, and the beads washed five times with lysis buffer. Coprecipitated proteins were electrophoresed and immunoblotted. 293T cells were transfected with the pFLAG-CMV-2 empty vector or the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector encoding WT or mutant p27Kip1. After transfection for 24 h, transfectants were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer for immunoprecipitation. After immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose, the proteins were incubated with recombinant inactive Akt (500 ng), active Akt (500 ng), or active CDK2 (10 units) in 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm MOPS, 25 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 112.5 μmATP, and 17 mm magnesium chloride) at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The levels of incorporated radioactivity were visualized and quantified with a BAS1000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The reactions were also electrophoresed and immunoblotted using an anti-p27Kip1 antibody. Phosphorylation of the synthetic PGLRRRQT peptide (Kiptide) was carried out according to a previously described method (25Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). In brief, recombinant inactive Akt (500 ng) or active Akt (500 ng) was incubated with 100 μm Kiptide in 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid, spotted onto phosphocellulose P-81 paper, washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid, air-dried, and subjected to Cerenkov counting. The loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN is often observed in tumor cells (27Myers M.P. Pass I. Batty I.H. Van der Kaay J. Stolarov J.P. Hemmings B.A. Wigler M.H. Downes C.P. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13513-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar), and the loss increases the amount of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which in turn activates Akt (21Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar). PTEN induces growth arrest in part by up-regulating p27Kip1(22Li D.M. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Although Akt transcriptionally regulates p27Kip1expression by phosphorylating and inhibiting Forkhead transcription factors (13Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), the post-translational regulation of p27Kip1expression remains unclear. Thus, we sought to determine whether p27Kip1 is directly phosphorylated by Akt. When immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged WT p27Kip1 was incubated in vitro with recombinant active Akt, p27Kip1 was phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner (Fig.1 A, lanes 5–8). This result indicates that p27Kip1 is one of the substrates of Akt. We then checked the in vivo p27Kip1binding to Akt by immunoprecipitating FLAG-tagged p27Kip1following Western blot analysis with an anti-Akt antibody. Fig.1 B (upper panel, lane 4) shows that Akt was co-immunoprecipitated with p27Kip1, suggesting that Akt interacts directly with and phosphorylates p27Kip1 in vivo. To confirm the p27Kip1 phosphorylation in vivo, the pFLAG-p27Kip1 plasmid was cotransfected with WT, active (myristoylated or E40K), or dominant-negative (AAA) aktcDNA into 293T cells. The phosphorylation of p27Kip1was estimated by immunoblot analysis using an anti-phospho-Ser/Thr Akt substrate antibody that can preferentially recognize the conserved Akt phosphorylation motif (RXRXX(S/T), whereX is any amino acid) (28Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar) only when Ser or Thr is phosphorylated by Akt. As shown in Fig. 1 C (upper panel), the anti-phospho-Ser/Thr Akt substrate antibody recognized the phosphorylated form of p27Kip1 only when 293T cells were cotransfected with WT or active (myristoylated or E40K)akt cDNA. The in vivo phosphorylation of p27Kip1 was also observed in COS-7 cells when they were transfected with WT p27kip1 and WT aktcDNAs (data not shown), suggesting that p27Kip1phosphorylation by Akt is not restricted to one particular cell line. By contrast, cotransfection with dominant-negative (AAA) aktcDNA did not induce p27Kip1 phosphorylation (Fig.1 C, lane 8), indicating that Akt kinase activity is required for p27Kip1 phosphorylation. Incubation of the cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (50 μm) or the PDK1 inhibitor UCN-01 (1 μm) (24Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) decreased the level of Thr308-phosphorylated Akt within 2 h (Fig. 2 A,third panel). LY294002 and UCN-01 decreased the phosphorylation of the endogenous Akt substrate glycogen synthase kinase-3β (data not shown), suggesting that Akt dephosphorylation is associated with its inactivation. Under this condition, we observed a decrease in the phospho-p27Kip1level (Fig. 2 A, upper panel, lanes 3and 4). These results strongly suggest that p27Kip1 is one of the substrates of Akt in vivo. To confirm that endogenous p27Kip1 was also phosphorylated in an Akt-dependent manner, we investigated the change in the endogenous phospho-p27Kip1 level after treatment of the cells with LY294002 and UCN-01. We found that LY294002 and UCN-01 decreased the phospho-p27Kip1 level in cells expressing only endogenous protein (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). These results indicate that p27Kip1 is indeed phosphorylated in an Akt-dependent manner in vivo. To identify the p27Kip1 phosphorylation sites, we generated several p27Kip1 point mutants in which Thr157 was converted to Ala (T157A) or Asp (T157D) because p27Kip1contains the conserved Akt phosphorylation motif (RKRPAT157) (Fig.3 B). Contrary to our expectation, the T157A and T157D p27Kip1 mutants were similarly phosphorylated by Akt (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5and 7) compared with WT p27Kip1 (lane 3). This result suggests either that Thr157 in p27Kip1 is not the Akt-mediated phosphorylation site or that the anti-phospho-Ser/Thr Akt substrate antibody cannot recognize phosphorylated Thr157 in p27Kip1. Thus, we prepared NH2- and COOH-terminal deletion mutants (Fig.3 B) and transfected them into 293T cells together with WT or dominant-negative (AAA) akt cDNA. Although WT p27Kip1 and the NH2-terminal deletion mutants ΔN26-p27Kip1 and ΔN52-p27Kip1 were equally phosphorylated by Akt (Fig. 3 C, upper panel,lanes 3 and 5), all the COOH-terminal deletion mutants (137STOP-p27Kip1, 156STOP-p27Kip1, and 185STOP-p27Kip1) were not phosphorylated by Akt (lanes 7, 9, and 11). These results suggest that the residues around amino acids 186–198 of p27Kip1 may contain the phosphorylation sites. Among these residues, p27Kip1 contains two threonine residues (Thr187 and Thr198), but does not contain a Ser residue. Thus, we prepared several point mutants in which Thr187 or Thr198 of p27Kip1 was converted to Ala (T187A and T198A, respectively) or Thr198was converted to Asp (T198D). Cotransfection of these mutants with WTakt cDNA revealed that the anti-phospho-Ser/Thr Akt substrate antibody could not detect the FLAG-tagged (in the pFLAG vector) or blue fluorescence protein-tagged (in the pQBI vector) T198A and T198D mutants (Fig. 3 D, upper panel,lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7). By contrast, mutation of Thr187 had no effects on the recognition capability of the anti-phospho-Ser/Thr Akt substrate antibody (Fig. 3 D, upper panel, lanes 5 and 8). These results indicate that Thr198 in p27Kip1 is a novel phosphorylation site that is phosphorylated by Akt and that the anti-phospho-Ser/Thr Akt substrate antibody recognizes the site only when it is phosphorylated. Although the anti-phospho-Ser/Thr Akt substrate antibody preferentially recognized the peptides containing phospho-Thr/Ser preceded by Arg at positions −5 and −3, it had some cross-reactivity with those containing phospho-Thr/Ser preceded by Arg at positions −3 and −2. This could be why the antibody is able to recognize phospho-Thr198 without Arg at position −5 (LRRRQpT198). To further confirm that Akt can phosphorylate Thr198, a synthetic peptide around the hypothetical phosphorylation site (PGLRRRQT, Kiptide) was incubated with recombinant active or inactive Akt in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3 E, Akt phosphorylated Kiptide. These results strongly indicate that Thr198 in p27Kip1 is a novel phosphorylation site. p27Kip1 is known to be phosphorylated at Ser10 (20Ishida N.

We thus examined whether Akt can phosphorylate these sites using point mutants in which Thr198, Thr187, Thr157, or Ser10 of p27Kip1 was converted to Ala (T198A, T187A, T157A, and S10A, respectively). Immunoprecipitated WT p27Kip1 and its point mutants were incubated in vitro with recombinant active or inactive Akt. Akt is known to be phosphorylated by itself at Ser473 (5Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous report, active (but not inactive) Akt was phosphorylated by itself (Fig. 4 A, upper arrowhead); and under this condition, WT p27Kip1 was phosphorylated by active Akt (but not by inactive Akt) (lower arrowhead). Conversion of Thr198 or Ser10to Ala (T198A and S10A, respectively) in p27Kip1drastically decreased the Akt-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 4,A and B), but it was only slightly decreased by Thr187 mutation (T187A). By contrast, the level of phospho-T157A p27Kip1 was similar to that of WT p27Kip1. Consistent with previous reports (16Muller D. Bouchard C. Rudolph B. Steiner P. Stuckmann I. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Huttner W. Eilers M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2561-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E.

Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), we observed a drastic decrease in the phosphorylated level of the T187A mutant and a slight decrease in the phospho-S10A p27Kip1level when these mutants were incubated in vitro with recombinant active CDK2 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 4 and6, respectively). Thr198 or Thr157mutation did not affect cyclin E-CDK2 complex-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C, lanes 3 and 5). Thus, Thr198 might be specifically phosphorylated by Akt. Moreover, Akt may be one of the unidentified Ser10kinases. We also examined in vivo Akt-dependent Thr187 phosphorylation using a phospho-Thr187-specific p27Kip1 antibody and Skp2 binding to p27Kip1. Fig.5 (A and B,upper panels) shows that Akt did induce p27Kip1phosphorylation at Thr187 and Skp2 binding, indicating that Akt also phosphorylates p27Kip1 at Thr187 and possibly promotes proteasome-dependent degradation (31Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 32Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat.

Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Thus, Akt preferentially phosphorylates at both Ser10 and Thr198 and slightly phosphorylates at Thr187 in p27Kip1 in vivo. We then examined the role of Thr198 phosphorylation. We first examined p27Kip1 binding to 14-3-3 because many proteins translocate to the cytoplasm by binding to 14-3-3, and the identified phosphorylation site (LRRRQpT198) has homology to 14-3-3-binding motifs (RXX(pS/pT) or RXXX(pS/pT), where X is any amino acid and pS/pT represents phosphorylated serine or threonine) (34Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3061-3064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged p27Kip1 was immunoprecipitated from 293T cells that had been transfected with pFLAG-p27kip1 and pHM6–14-3-3θ. As shown in Fig.6 A (upper panel,lane 3), 14-3-3θ was co-immunoprecipitated with p27Kip1 only when Akt was cotransfected into 293T cells, indicating that 14-3-3 binds to the phosphorylated form of p27Kip1 in vivo. As the 14-3-3θ mutant (R56A/R60A), which loses its ligand binding ability (35Thorson J.A. Yu L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), failed to bind to p27Kip1 (Fig. 6 A, upper panel, lane 4), the binding to 14-3-3 became specific. We further examined the p27Kip1 binding capability for other 14-3-3 isoforms. Although all bound to Raf-1 (data not shown), p27Kip1 could not bind to 14-3-3β and 14-3-3ζ (Fig.6 B, upper panel, lanes 3 and4). Moreover, p27Kip1 binding to 14-3-3η and 14-3-3ε was very weak (Fig. 6 B, upper panel,lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that the not all 14-3-3 isoforms bind to phospho-p27Kip1. We then tried to identify the phosphorylation-dependent 14-3-3-binding site in p27Kip1 by transfecting 14-3-3θ together with WTp27kip1 and its point mutants S10A, T187A, T198A, and S10A/T187A/T198A into 293T cells. 14-3-3 binding to p27Kip1 was diminished only when Thr198 in p27Kip1 was converted to Ala (T198A and S10A/T187A/T198A (Triple)) (Fig. 7 A,upper panel, lanes 11 and 12). To confirm the results, we carried out peptide binding experiments. We obtained a biotinylated threonine-phosphorylated peptide (RRRQpT) and a non-phosphorylated peptide (RRRQT). The threonine-phosphorylated peptide bound to WT 14-3-3θ (Fig. 7 B, lane 5), but not to the 14-3-3θ mutant (R56A/R60A) (lane 6). However, the non-phosphorylated peptide did not bind to either WT or mutant 14-3-3θ (Fig. 7 B, lanes 2 and3). Thus, 14-3-3 recognizes and binds to p27Kip1only when Thr198 is phosphorylated by Akt. To examine the role of 14-3-3 binding to p27Kip1, we investigated the subcellular localization of p27Kip1 in vivo. After transfecting WT, single-point mutant (T198A or S10A), or double-point mutant (T198A/S10A) of p27kip1 , nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated using the NE-PER extraction kit. Immunoblot analysis with an anti-phospho-Ser/Thr Akt substrate antibody clearly indicated that p27Kip1 phosphorylated at Thr198was localized only in the cytoplasm (Fig.8 A, upper panel,lanes 1 and 5). These results indicate that Akt-mediated phosphorylation at Thr198 promotes 14-3-3 binding and participates in cytoplasmic localization (Fig.8 B). Because Akt-mediated phosphorylation also promotes Skp2 binding to p27Kip1 (Fig. 5 B), Akt might induce the proteasome-dependent degradation of p27Kip1through promoting its cytoplasmic localization. By activation of PI3K, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 are synthesized at the plasma membrane, and the serine/threonine kinase Akt is recruited to the plasma membrane (1Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar,2Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Interaction of Akt with these lipids induces a conformational change in Akt. Then, Akt is phosphorylated at two key regulatory sites, Thr308 in the activation loop of the catalytic domain and Ser473 in the COOH-terminal domain. Dual phosphorylation at both residues is necessary for full activation of Akt. Activated Akt prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis and contributes tumor formation and progression by phosphorylating Bad, procaspase-9, IκB kinase, and Forkhead transcription factors (1Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 2Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). In addition to suppressing apoptosis, Akt contributes to cell-cycle progression. For example, activated Akt translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates MDM2 (murine double minute2) and p21Waf1/Cip1, resulting in p53 degradation and cytoplasmic localization of p21Waf1/Cip1(36Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 37Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M.H. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Akt is often activated in tumor cells lacking PTEN expression. By contrast, p27Kip1 expression is frequently down-regulated in PTEN-negative tumor cells. Because transfection ofPTEN induces growth arrest in part by up-regulating p27Kip1 expression (22Li D.M. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), it is possible that Akt promotes cell-cycle progression by regulating p27Kip1 function. The function of p27Kip1 is regulated by changes in its concentration and in its subcellular localization. The p27Kip1 concentration is reported to be controlled mainly by proteasome-dependent degradation (16Muller D. Bouchard C. Rudolph B. Steiner P. Stuckmann I. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Huttner W. Eilers M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2561-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E.

Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Thr187 by the cyclin E-CDK2 complex triggers p27Kip1 binding to Skp2, a member of the F-box family of proteins that associates with the SCF (Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein) ubiquitin-ligase complex (31Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 32Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat.

Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In addition to the ubiquitin-dependent pathway, p27Kip1 is degraded by ubiquitin-independent proteolytic cleavage (38Shirane M. Harumiya Y. Ishida N. Hirai A. Miyamoto C. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13886-13893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We found here that Akt also phosphorylated p27Kip1 at Thr187 (Fig. 4) and promoted p27Kip1 binding to Skp2 (Fig. 5). Because several mitogenic factors are known to decrease p27Kip1 protein amounts upon transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (39Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 40Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), Akt might contribute to cell-cycle progression by promoting p27Kip1destabilization through directly phosphorylating Thr187. To exhibit CDK inhibitory action, p27Kip1 needs to be transported into the nucleus. The nuclear import of p27Kip1is dependent on the nuclear localization signal localized near the COOH terminus (41Zeng Y. Hirano K. Hirano M. Nishimura J. Kanaide H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the interaction with nuclear pore-associated protein-60 (42Muller D. Thieke K. Burgin A. Dickmanns A. Eilers M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). By contrast, the association with Jab1 (Jun activation domain-binding protein-1) promotes cytoplasmic localization and degradation of p27Kip1 (43Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Recently, phosphorylation at Ser10 by unknown kinases was reported to increase nuclear export of p27Kip1 (30Rodier G. Montagnoli A. Di Marcotullio L. Coulombe P. Draetta G.F. Pagano M. Meloche S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6672-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) through binding to CRM1 (20Ishida N. Hara T. Kamura T. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14355-14358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of Ser10 is not sufficient to promote cytoplasmic localization of p27Kip1 because the S10D mutant is also localized in the nucleus in G0/G1 cells. Rodier et al. (30Rodier G. Montagnoli A. Di Marcotullio L. Coulombe P. Draetta G.F. Pagano M. Meloche S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6672-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) suggested that another signal provided by serum growth factors appears to be necessary to direct p27 to the cytoplasm. Thus, some kinases regulate degradation and cytoplasmic localization of p27Kip1 through phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms. Because Akt is also activated by serum stimulation, we hypothesized that Akt participates in the phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization of p27Kip1. We observed that Akt bound to and phosphorylated p27Kip1 in vivo andin vitro (Figs. 1 and 2). Identification of p27Kip1 phosphorylation sites revealed that Akt phosphorylated p27Kip1 at Ser10 (Fig. 4). Therefore, Akt might participate in nuclear export of p27Kip1 as well as p27Kip1 degradation. Moreover, Akt might be one of the unidentified Ser10kinases. In addition to Ser10 and Thr187, we identified the COOH-terminal Thr198 residue as a novel phosphorylation site (Fig. 3). Because the identified phosphorylation site around Thr198 has homology to 14-3-3-binding motifs (RXX(pS/pT) or RXXX(pS/pT)) (34Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3061-3064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), we investigated p27Kip1 binding to 14-3-3. As expected, 14-3-3θ could bind to p27Kip1 through Thr198 only when it was phosphorylated by Akt (Fig. 7 A). This result is supported by the fact that the synthetic phospho-Thr198 peptide (RRRQpT), but not the non-phospho-Thr198 peptide (RRRQT), bound to 14-3-3θ in vitro (Fig. 7 B). Because 14-3-3θ, 14-3-3η, and 14-3-3ε (but not 14-3-3β and 14-3-3ζ) could form a complex with p27Kip1 (Fig. 6 B), 14-3-3 proteins might have some isoform specificity for recognizing their partners. 14-3-3 binding is known to promote cytoplasmic localization of some cell-cycle regulators such as Cdc25, Wee1, and CDK2 (34Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3061-3064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions with an anti-phospho-Ser/Thr Akt substrate antibody clearly indicated that phospho-p27Kip1 (Thr198) was localized only in the cytoplasm (Fig. 8 A). Therefore, Akt might accelerate p27Kip1 cytoplasmic localization by phosphorylating Thr198 in addition to Ser10. In summary, we discovered that Akt-mediated p27Kip1phosphorylation directly induces p27Kip1 binding to 14-3-3 and cytoplasmic localization through phosphorylating the newly identified Thr198 residue. Because Akt also phosphorylates p27Kip1 at Thr187 and Ser10, which are involved in Skp2-mediated ubiquitinylation (31Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat.

Spohn B. Lee M.H. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) have recently reported that Akt-dependent phosphorylation promotes cytoplasmic localization of p21Waf1/Cip1 in Her-2/neu-overexpressing cells. Overexpression of Her-2/neu is also known to promote cytoplasmic localization and degradation of p27Kip1 (44Yang H.Y. Zhou B.P. Hung M.C. Lee M.H. J. Biol.

Therefore, Akt might be involved in abnormal cell proliferation ofHer-2/neu-overexpressing cells by phosphorylation-dependent cytoplasmic localization and degradation of both p27Kip1 and p21Waf1/Cip1cell-cycle inhibitors.

Here, we report an appetitive operant conditioning procedure in Aplysia that induces long-term memory. Biophysical changes that accompanied the memory were found in an identified neuron (cell B51) that is considered critical for the expression of behavior that was rewarded. Similar cellular changes in B51 were produced by contingent reinforcement of B51 with dopamine in a single-cell analog of the operant procedure. These findings allow for the detailed analysis of the cellular and molecular processes underlying operant conditioning."

However, the relationship between ion homeostasis and specific cell death pathways has not been investigated in the context of I/R. Previously we reported that calpain cleaved Bid in the absence of detectable caspase activation (1Chen M. He H. Zhan S. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol.

In this study, we have shown that an inhibitor of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger prevented calpain activation after I/R. Calpain inhibitors prevented cleavage of Bid as well as the downstream indices of cell death, including DNA strand breaks, creatine kinase (CK) release, and infarction measured by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. In contrast, the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor IDN6734 was not protective in this model. To ascertain whether mitochondrial dysfunction downstream of these events was a required step, we utilized a peptide corresponding to residues 4–23 of Bcl-xL conjugated to the protein transduction domain of HIV TAT (TAT-BH4), which has been shown to protect mitochondria against Ca2+-induced ΔΨm loss (2Shimizu S.

TAT-BH4 attenuated CK release and loss of TTC staining, demonstrating the role of mitochondria and a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member in the process leading to cell death. We propose the following pathway. (i) Reperfusion results in sodium influx followed by calcium accumulation. (ii) This leads to calpain activation, which in turn leads to Bid cleavage.

Caspase inhibitors have been shown to decrease DNA fragmentation detected by TUNEL1 labeling; however, the effect on infarct size has been modest, implying that other pathways to death must exist. Interventions to block sodium influx via inhibition of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger with ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) or related compounds such as cariporide have been shown to be protective (reviewed in Refs. 13Karmazyn M.

Less is known about their effects on activation of caspases and calpains. It is reasonable to predict that inhibition of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger would limit calpain activation; however, this has not been formally demonstrated. Calpain has long been recognized as an important mediator in necrotic cell death, and calpain inhibitors are known to reduce infarct size (18Iwamoto H. Miura T. Okamura T. Shirakawa K. Iwatate M. Kawamura S. Tatsuno H. Ikeda Y. Matsuzaki M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1999; 33: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We recently showed that calpain was able to cleave the BH3 only family member, Bid, to an active form capable of mediating cytochromec release (1Chen M. He H. Zhan S. Krajewski S. Reed J.C.

These observations support the theory that there is cross-talk between apoptotic and necrotic pathways and that calpain could contribute to apoptosis even in the presence of caspase inhibition. Although cytochrome c release has been considered the major consequence of the interaction of Bid with mitochondria, other mediators are simultaneously released that may play a role in committing the cell to death. These mediators include Smac/Diablo (25Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar,26Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G.

Additionally, the loss of cytochrome c will result in an inability to perform oxidative phosphorylation (30Krippner A. Yagi A. Gottlieb R.A. Babior B.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11401-11404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Finally, mitochondrial dysfunction associated with irreversible opening of the permeability transition pore is strongly correlated with cell death (32Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar), and interventions to prevent pore opening have been shown to protect the myocardium (33Di Lisa F. Menabo R. Canton M. Petronilli V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial dysfunction and permeability transition pore opening are regulated in part by the voltage-dependent anion channel of the outer mitochondrial membrane (VDAC) (reviewed in Ref. 32Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress as would be encountered in ischemia and reperfusion has been shown to trigger VDAC-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction (34Madesh M. Hajnoczky G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and opening of the permeability transition pore (35Takeyama N. Miki S. Hirakawa A. Tanaka T. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 274: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). VDAC participation in pore opening is regulated by pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (36Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1174-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Recently Shimizu et al. (2Shimizu S. Konishi A. Kodama T. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3100-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) used a peptide corresponding to the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain 4 (BH4) of Bcl-xL to prevent VDAC opening. The peptide was delivered intracellularly by covalently coupling it to the protein transduction domain of HIV TAT (37Becker-Hapak M. McAllister S.S. Dowdy S.F. Methods. 2001; 24: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if VDAC-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction is an essential aspect of ischemic injury, then preservation of mitochondrial integrity by the TAT-BH4 peptide should be cardioprotective. Efforts to distinguish apoptosis, necrosis, and oncosis have engendered considerable controversy. In this study we have assessed tissue death through loss of TTC staining and release of CK but have not attempted to define individual cell death events by morphologic criteria. However, we note that DNA fragmentation occurs and correlates with the degree of injury or protection measured by TTC staining or CK release. Our focus has been on the identification of specific sequential events that are amenable to inhibition, with attendant cardioprotective effects. To gain insight into the sequence and hierarchy of cell death events in the ischemic and reperfused heart, we have examined the effects of inhibition of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger on calpain activity and the effects of calpain and caspase inhibitors on Bid cleavage, DNA fragmentation, and the ability of TAT-BH4 to attenuate tissue injury. Male New Zealand White rabbits (2.0–2.5 kg) or male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) were utilized for the preparation of Langendorff-perfused hearts. The experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all experimental procedures were approved by the Scripps Research Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. The animal was anesthetized and the heart rapidly excised and mounted onto a Langendorff heart perfusion apparatus using a protocol adapted from Tsuchida et al. (38Tsuchida A. Liu Y. Liu G.S. Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The heart was perfused at a constant pressure of 60 mm Hg with Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) consisting of (in mmol/liter) NaCl (118), KCl (4.75), KH2PO4 (1.18), MgSO4·7H2O (1.18), CaCl2·2H2O (2.5), NaHCO3 (25Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar), and glucose (11Okamura T. Miura T. Takemura G. Fujiwara H. Iwamoto H. Kawamura S. Kimura M. Ikeda Y. Iwatate M. Matsuzaki M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 642-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The perfusate was bubbled with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Perfused hearts were stabilized for 15 min and then subjected to global ischemia for 30 min by turning off the perfusion system. After 30 min of ischemia, the perfusion system was restarted, and the hearts were reperfused for the indicated time. Inhibitors were added to the perfusion buffer 10 min before ischemia and included in the reperfusion buffer. Inhibitors were as follows: calpain inhibitor I or III (10 μm) (ALLN or CI3, respectively, Calbiochem); caspase inhibitor (20 μm) (IDN6734, generously provided by Idun Pharmaceuticals, San Diego); and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) (5 μm) (Sigma). To examine the effect of Bcl-xLon infarct size, we used a cell-permeable peptide that contains the conserved N-terminal homology domain (BH4) of Bcl-xL linked to the HIV-TAT sequence (TAT-BH4, Calbiochem). TAT-BH4 (50 nm) was included in the perfusion buffer for 15 min following the initial equilibration period and then washed out with KRB buffer for 10 min before ischemia and reperfusion. TAT-BH4 was not included in the reperfusion buffer. Coronary effluent was collected for 15 min before ischemia and at the beginning of reperfusion. CK activity in coronary effluent was determined using a kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). The measurement of infarct size using triphenyl tetrazolium staining was essentially identical to that detailed by Downey. 2J. M. Downey (2000) usouthal.edu/ishr/help/ttc/. The method of quantitation was previously described (40He H. Chen M. Scheffler N.K. Gibson B.W. Spremulli L.L. Gottlieb R.A. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the TTC reaction, the heart slices were scanned into TIFF files and analyzed with Adobe Photoshop 5.5. The images were digitally manipulated in an identical manner to ensure equivalent outcome. The histogram counts of red and white were recorded. The percent infarction was calculated as white counts divided by the sum of red plus white counts. Cytosolic fractions were prepared as previously described (1Chen M. He H. Zhan S. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30724-30728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Calpain activity was measured using 50 μmSuc-Leu-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-Leu-Tyr-AMC) as the substrate (Calbiochem). Cytosol (20 μl corresponds to 100 μg of protein) was added to 100 μl of reaction buffer (145 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3). AMC release was measured over 1 h at room temperature by fluorimetry (Molecular Devices) using 360-nm excitation and 430-nm emission filters. Standard curves were generated for each experiment using known concentrations of AMC. Calpain activity was expressed as nmol of AMC released/min/mg protein. All measurements were made in triplicate and repeated with extracts from several independent experiments. For statistical analysis, each heart (consisting of triplicate measurements) was treated as an individual data point. For each analysis, calpain activity was normalized to the control value performed the same day. For Western blot analysis, cytosolic proteins were determined by a Coomassie Blue binding assay (Pierce Chemical Co.) with bovine serum albumin standards. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to electrophoresis on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Novex) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore Corp). Blots were incubated with antibody to α-spectrin (Chemicon International, Inc.) followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. At the end of perfusion, a coronal median slice 2 mm thick was removed from the heart and immersed in freshly prepared 4% formaldehyde in KRB overnight. A standard histological method was applied to prepare the paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Tissue sections were dewaxed with xylene and rehydrated with graded alcohol. For single strand DNA staining, tissue sections were treated with saponin (0.1 mg/ml) at room temperature for 20 min followed by 20 min of incubation in proteinase K (20 μg/ml) and 20 min of incubation in 50% formamide in water bath at 56 °C. The sections were then transferred to ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. After 30 min of incubation in 3% nonfat dry milk, tissue sections were incubated with 10–20 μl (100 μg/ml) of mouse monoclonal antibody against single-stranded DNA (Alexis) at room temperature for 30 min and then incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgM antibody (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.) followed by Cy2-conjugated streptavidin. Nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide. To detect Bid cleavage, tissue sections were deparaffinized and after microwave antigen retrieval were immunostained using a diaminobenzidine-based detection method. The Envision-Rabbit polymer-based complex reagent (Dako) was used as the secondary antibody in an automated immunostainer (Dako Universal Staining System) as previously described (41Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Ellerby L.M. Welsh K. Xie Z. Deveraux Q.L. Salvesen G.S. Bredesen D.E. Rosenthal R.E. Fiskum G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previously, we showed that calpain activity, but not caspase activity, is increased following myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (1Chen M. He H. Zhan S. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol.

To determine whether caspase inhibitors affected calpain activity, we perfused hearts with the pan-caspase inhibitor IDN6734 or with the calpain inhibitor ALLN and then measured calpain activity in cytosolic extracts. As previously published and as shown in Fig. 1, calpain activity increased following I/R. Infusion of ALLN reduced calpain activity substantially, and addition of ALLN directly to the lysate from the I/R heart fully inhibited calpain activity. In contrast, IDN6734 infusion had only a modest effect on calpain activity. Direct addition of IDN6734 to the I/R lysate reduced calpain activity to the same minor extent. We next assessed the effect of calpain and caspase inhibition on myocardial injury. Calpain inhibition by perfusion of CI3 reduced CK release by 80%, whereas IDN6734 had no effect (Fig.2 A). Similar effects on infarct size were seen, with a 50% reduction in infarct size by CI3 infusion and no reduction of infarct size with infusion of IDN6734 (Fig. 2 B). Some investigators have suggested that the presence of single strand DNA breaks serves to distinguish apoptosis from necrosis (42Frankfurt O.S. Krishan A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that calpain activation is a feature of necrotic death. However, our previous work demonstrated cross-talk between calpain and classic apoptotic pathways. Using an antibody that recognizes the single strand breaks and chromatin remodeling considered to be a characteristic feature of apoptosis, we detected DNA fragmentation in hearts perfused with CI3 or IDN6734 and subjected to I/R. As shown in Fig.3, CI3 infusion reduced the number of cells with single strand breaks, whereas IDN6734 had no effect. These results suggested that calpain was responsible for initiating apoptosis, and we turned our attention to its activation.Figure 3Effect of CI3 and IDN6734 on apoptosis.Hearts were perfusion-fixed and stained as described under “Methods and Materials.” Nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide (inset). Representative fields from three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Inhibition of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger is known to be cardioprotective through the limitation of calcium influx. We hypothesized that limitation of calcium influx would limit the activation of calpain. Hearts were subjected to I/R in the presence or absence of EIPA, and calpain activity was determined after 15 min reperfusion. We measured calpain activity by cleavage of a synthetic peptide substrate and restricted our analysis to calcium-independent activity, which would reflect the fraction of calpain that had undergone proteolytic activation in vivo. EIPA infusion suppressed calpain activation back to the level seen in control hearts (Fig.4 A). Calpain activation is additionally revealed by the cleavage of α-spectrin to yield a 150-kDa fragment (43Pike B.R. Zhao X. Newcomb J.K. Wang K.K. Posmantur R.M. Hayes R.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). EIPA infusion prevented the cleavage of α-spectrin that otherwise occurred during I/R (Fig. 4 B). This result suggested that prevention of sodium influx with its attendant calcium elevation had the important effect of suppressing calpain activation. Previously we showed that Bid was cleaved by calpain in vitro and that I/R resulted in Bid cleavage. To determine whether Bid cleavage in the heart was mediated by caspases or calpains, we perfused hearts with ALLN or IDN6734 followed by 30 min ischemia and 90 min reperfusion. We assessed Bid cleavage using an antibody that recognized intact, full-length Bid but not the cleaved fragments (Fig.5). Immunostaining of sections from heart subjected to 30 min ischemia and 15 min reperfusion demonstrated partial loss of Bid immunoreactivity with nearly complete disappearance of Bid after 90 min reperfusion. Calpain inhibition with ALLN preserved Bid immunoreactivity. However, in hearts infused with IDN6734, Bid immunoreactivity was lost to a considerable extent, suggesting that calpain is the protease responsible for most, if not all, Bid cleavage in the ischemic heart. The cleaved C-terminal fragment of Bid targets the mitochondria, leading to release of cytochrome c. The changes that accompany cytochromec release include loss of oxidative phosphorylation capacity, loss of calcium homeostasis, excess superoxide production, and release of additional pro-apoptotic factors including endonucleases. The BH4 domain of Bcl-xL has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for protection against mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis and recently was shown to interact with truncated Bid (22Gil-Parrado S. Fernandez-Montalvan A. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Popp O. Bestvater F. Holloschi A. Knoch T.A. Auerswald E.A. Welsh K. Reed J.C. Fritz H. Fuentes-Prior P. Spiess E. Salvesen G.S. Machleidt W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We used a TAT-conjugated BH4 peptide corresponding to amino acids 4–23 of Bcl-xL, which has been shown to protect mitochondria (2Shimizu S. Konishi A. Kodama T. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3100-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Hearts perfused with TAT-BH4 demonstrated reduced injury after I/R, as measured by CK release and TTC staining (Fig. 6). Our findings indicate that in this model of 30 min global ischemia and 2 h reperfusion, performed both in rabbit and rat, caspase activation is a minor component of apoptosis and overall tissue injury. Instead, we have found that calpain activation is responsible for initiating a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic program, as suggested by our earlier report (1Chen M. He H. Zhan S. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30724-30728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and by the report of a similar pathway in ionomycin-induced cell death (22Gil-Parrado S. Fernandez-Montalvan A. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Popp O. Bestvater F. Holloschi A. Knoch T.A. Auerswald E.A. Welsh K. Reed J.C. Fritz H. Fuentes-Prior P. Spiess E. Salvesen G.S. Machleidt W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Our observations lead us to propose the linear sequence of events depicted in Fig.7. Inhibition of sodium influx has previously been shown to limit calcium influx, and we now demonstrate that this prevents calpain activation. Although the calcium elevation itself could target the mitochondria, we show that inhibition of calpain is able to protect the myocardium, indicating that calcium influx itself is not directly responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction and tissue damage. We show that calpain cleaves Bid, which targets the mitochondrion. Bid has been shown to interact with Bcl-xL, although it is not clear whether this involves the BH4 domain (22Gil-Parrado S. Fernandez-Montalvan A. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Popp O. Bestvater F. Holloschi A. Knoch T.A. Auerswald E.A. Welsh K. Reed J.C. Fritz H. Fuentes-Prior P. Spiess E. Salvesen G.S. Machleidt W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Although Bid is one protein that targets mitochondria after cleavage by calpain, many other potential targets of calpain exist, both known and unknown. Consistent with observations in cell culture (27Daugas E. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Leber B. Andrews D. Penninger J. Kroemer G.

Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), we suggest that the mitochondria may release factors and reactive oxygen species that cause DNA fragmentation and death in the setting of ischemia and reperfusion. Although cytochrome c release is a cofactor for caspase activation, we suggest that in this setting other pro-apoptotic factors released from the mitochondria are important mediators of cell death. We demonstrate that preserving mitochondrial function with the TAT-BH4 peptide is cardioprotective. This is consistent with the findings of others who have shown that Bcl-2 can protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury (44Chen Z. Chua C.C. Ho Y.S. Hamdy R.C. Chua B.H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2313-H2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Brocheriou V. Hagege A.A. Oubenaissa A. Lambert M. Mallet V.O. Duriez M. Wassef M. Kahn A. Menasche P. Gilgenkrantz H. J. Gene Med. 2000; 2: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The critical requirement for mitochondrial participation in the death process is underscored by the protective effect of the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel in preconditioning. This channel has been suggested to preserve calcium homeostasis and would therefore limit calpain activation (39Murata M. Akao M. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The massive calcium influx that occurs with reperfusion has been assumed to be responsible for opening of the permeability transition pore, leading to mitochondrial swelling and rupture. However, our observation that calpain inhibition is protective suggests that pore opening, if it occurs, is downstream of calpain activation and Bid cleavage. Further studies will be necessary to identify the mitochondrial factors that mediate irreversible injury."

Although retroviral delivery of Cx43 and Cx26 cDNAs to MDA-MB-231 cells did not achieve an expected substantial rescue of intercellular communication, overexpression of connexin genes did result in a dramatic suppression of tumor growth when connexin-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells were implanted into the mammary fat pad of nude mice.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). A family of homologous proteins called connexins comprise the basic building blocks of gap junctions (1Bruzzone R. White T.W.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Connexins are co-translationally inserted into endoplasmic reticulum membrane and oligomerized into hemichannels (connexons), which are transported to the plasma membrane (3Laird D.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Connexons from two contacting cells dock at the plasma membrane to form intercellular gap junction channels, which cluster to form gap junction plaques (3Laird D.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Presently, in excess of fifteen connexin genes have been identified and cloned (1Bruzzone R. White T.W. Paul D.L. Eur. J.

However, only three connexins, connexin26 (Cx26), connexin43 (Cx43), and connexin32 (Cx32), have been found in rodent mammary epithelium in different temporal and spatial patterns (4Monaghan P.

Cx43 is localized mainly to myoepithelial cells throughout all of the stages of mammary gland development, whereas Cx26 is localized primarily to the luminal cells (6Monaghan P. Moss D. Cell Biol. Int. 1996; 20: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Expression of Cx26 increases in pregnancy and peaks during lactation. Cx32 is a minor connexin expressed in luminal cells, and it can be detected only in lactating gland (6Monaghan P. Moss D. Cell Biol.

Connexin expression, gap junction assembly, and GJIC are down-regulated in a variety of neoplastic cells or primary tumors both in vivo and in vitro (9Naus C.C. Bechberger J.F. Caveney S. Wilson J.X.

In many cases the restoration of connexin expression and GJIC has reduced tumor growth and promoted cell differentiation (12Yamasaki H. Omori Y. Krutovskikh V. Zhu W. Mironov N. Yamakage K. Mesnil M. Novartis Foundation Symposium. 1999; 219: 241-254PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, connexin genes have been deemed tumor suppressors. Further evidence supporting the role of connexins as tumor suppressors came from Cx32 knockout mice, which were found to be more susceptible to liver tumor formation in comparison to wild-type littermates (15Temme A. Buchmann A. Gabriel H.D. Nelles E. Schwarz M. Willecke K. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 713-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In the human breast, Wilgenbus et al. (16Wilgenbus K.K. Kirkpatrick C.J. Knuechel R. Willecke K. Traub O. Intl. J. Cancer. 1992; 51: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) reported the lack of Cx43 expression in malignant tumors. Lee et al. (17Lee S.W. Tomasetto C. Paul D. Keyomarsi K. Sager R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) also found that Cx43 mRNA was not detected in several mammary tumor cell lines, and subtractive hybridization was used to identify Cx26 as a potential tumor-suppressing molecule (18Lee S.W. Tomasetto C. Sager R. Proc. of the Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2825-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, we found a deficiency of Cx43 gap junctions in several human breast carcinomas (7Laird D.W. Fistouris P. Batist G. Alpert L. Huynh H.T. Carystinos G.D. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4104-4110PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Jamieson et al. (19Jamieson S. Going J.J. Darcy R. George W.D. J. Pathol. 1998; 184: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) compared the expression of Cx43 and Cx26 in normal human breast tissues and human breast tumor tissues in situ and found that many invasive carcinomas expressed one of these two connexins but that most often these connexins were not assembled into gap junctions. These latter results suggest that a population of transformed mammary epithelial cells continue to express connexins but have lost the ability to assemble connexins into functional gap junctions. If connexin transgene approaches ever are to be used as part of a potential human breast cancer therapy regimen, it is necessary to develop a delivery system for introducing connexins in vivoand to determine whether human breast tumor cells are generally capable of expressing exogenous connexins and forming functional gap junctions. Although a clear relationship between connexin expression, GJIC, and carcinogenesis has been elucidated, the understanding of gap junctions in the development of human breast cancer has yet to be established. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the tumor-suppressing properties of connexins is restricted to the ability of connexins to form gap junction channels. In the present study we identified human breast cancer cells that mechanistically exhibit two types of GJIC defects. First, in cells that lack connexin expression (i.e. HBL100 cells) GJIC could be restored effectively using a retroviral system to deliver connexins. However, in cells that were defective in connexin trafficking and gap junction assembly (i.e. MDA-MB-231) exogenous connexins were delivered preferentially to lysosomes. Nevertheless, in vivodata revealed that, even in the absence of significant GJIC, overexpression of connexin genes in MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor cells suppressed tumor growth as the possible result of down-regulation of regulatory genes involved in tumor growth. All of the cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in the recommended medium including RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) for MDA-MB-231/Hs578T cells and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) for normal rat kidney (NRK), HeLa, and HBL100 cells. The medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (or 10% calf serum for HBL100 cells), 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human mammalian epithelial cells (HMEC) was purchased from Clonetic Human Cell Systems (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) and cultured in the mammary epithelial cell growth medium (BioWhittaker) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were immunolabeled as described previously by Laird et al. (20Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) with anti-Cx43 polyclonal antibodies directed against amino acid residues 360–382 of Cx43 (21Laird D.W. Revel J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 109-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or antibodies to Cx26 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). The images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 410 inverted confocal microscope equipped with a ×63 oil lens as described previously (20Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Single cells were pressure microinjected with 5% Lucifer Yellow (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) using an Eppendorf microinjection system and a Zeiss inverted epifluorescent microscope. Digital images were acquired using a CCD Sensicam. The percentage of microinjected cells that exhibited dye coupling and the order of dye transfer (first order, cells contacting the microinjected cell only; second order, cells distant from the microinjected cells by one cell, etc.) were determined. Because many of these tumor cells are prone to overlapping and piling up, dye that spread only to a single neighboring cell was quantified separately to allow for artifacts that might occur from the inadvertent penetration of two cells during the microinjection procedure. Cx43 and Cx26 cDNAs were provided by Dr. C. C. G. Naus. To engineer the retroviral vectors that encoded Cx43 or Cx26, we removed the enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene from an AP2 viral vector (22Galipeau J. Li H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2384-2394PubMed Google Scholar) by NotI digestion. Cx26 cDNA was engineered into the AP2 vector between BglII restriction sites while Cx43 cDNA was inserted between NotI and CalI. Recombinant retroviral vectors were transfected into 293GPG package cell lines to produce virus-containing supernatant that was further used for infecting the tumor cells as described previously (23Mao A.J. Bechberger J. Lidington D. Galipeau J. Laird D.W. Naus C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34407-34414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More than 90% of the mammary tumor cells expressed connexins after three rounds of viral infection. To examine cell growth in vitro, 5 × 104 cells were plated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow. At days 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 cells from replicated plates were collected and counted using a Coulter® ZTM 1 particle counter (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL). These data were plotted as the average cell number ± S.E. For in vivo tumor growth 6–8-week-old female Nu-Nu mice (18–22 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (St. Zotique, Quebec). The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care Committee of McGill University, Montreal, Quebec. Animals (5–15 per treatment) were housed 5 to a cage and fed rodent chow and waterad libitum. After 1 week of acclimatization, a suspension of 1 × 106 MDA-MB-231 viral control tumor cells or MDA-MB-231 tumor cells expressing Cx43 or Cx26 were transplanted into the mammary fat pad in a total volume of 0.1 ml of medium. Tumor length and width were measured every 3–8 days using a caliper accurate to 0.5 mm. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula V = L × W × 0.5W. The experiment was terminated when the control tumors reached the maximal size allowed. In this mouse study, MDA-MB-231 cells infected with the control retrovirus that did not encode a connexin, one mouse died prematurely and was eliminated from the data set. This data set was plotted as the average tumor size ± S.E. In the case of the mice transplanted with MDA-MB-231 expressing either Cx43 or Cx26, four mice failed to develop a tumor, three mice developed tumors that were too small to accurately measure, and three mice developed small tumors. The xenografts in nude mice were excised, fixed in 4% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4-μm thick sections for immunohistochemistry. Tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene, graded alcohol, and water, boiled in citric acid buffer for antigen retrieval, and blocked by 10% horse serum. The tissue sections were stained with anti-Cx43 polyclonal antibodies (Sigma) followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, ON). Positive immunolocalization of Cx43 was determined using the Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). For contrast, tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Finally, all images were acquired using the Zeiss Axioscope light microscope. Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) for the preparation of biotin-labeled cDNA probes. Nonrad-GEArray kits were purchased from SuperArray, Inc. (Bethesda, MD) and supplemented with positively charged nylon membrane on which cDNA fragments from genes had been immobilized in duplicate. The membrane used in our study contained 23 genes closely related to tumor growth and metastasis plus two positive control genes (GAPDH and β-actin) and one negative control (pUC18). Probe synthesis, hybridization, and chemiluminescent detection were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, 10 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into biotin-labeled cDNA probes at 42 °C for 120 min. The hybridization was performed with denatured cDNA probe at 68 °C overnight after a 1-h incubation of the membrane with sheared salmon sperm at 68 °C. For detection, the membrane was incubated with AP-streptavidin and then subjected to CDP-Star chemiluminescence substrate. The results were analyzed using the Multi-Analyst 1.0.1 software from Bio-Rad. Because no signal amplification was performed, the membranes were quantified first by subtracting the average background intensity for the pUC18-negative control and secondly by examining the signal ratio in comparison to the internal GAPDH-positive control (see Fig. 2,bottom right corner of blots). Differential hybridization levels of over 2-fold were considered physiologically relevant. Only fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR3) and CXCR4 were significantly regulated by both Cx43- and Cx26-expressing cells and pursued further. For Western blots, cells were lysed in solubilization buffer as described previously (20Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3529-3539PubMed Google Scholar), and protein quantification was determined using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were subsequently immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies (anti-Cx43 and anti-FGFR3, Sigma). Specific antibody binding was determined using the West-Pico chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). To assure equal gel loading, nitrocellulose membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and blots were reprobed for the housekeeping enzyme GAPDH (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, ON, Canada). We initially characterized the expression of the only known human breast connexins, Cx26 and Cx43, in three different human breast tumor cells by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. Endogenous Cx43-positive NRK cells were used together with HMEC to demonstrate the distribution and assembly of Cx43 into gap junction plaques (Fig. 1, A andB, arrows). In a subpopulation of Hs578T cells, Cx43 was capable of assembling into gap junction plaque-like structures on the cell surface (Fig. 1 C, arrows), whereas in MDA-MB-231 cells intracellular Cx43 was visible, but no gap junction plaques were observed (Fig. 1 D). Immunofluorescence failed to detect Cx43 in HBL100 cells (Fig. 1 E). By immunoblotting, Cx43 was detected in cell lysates from NRK, HMEC, Hs578T, and MDA-MB-231 cells but not in HBL100 cells (Fig. 1 F). Phosphorylated species of Cx43 (slower migrating forms) were apparent in NRK cells, suggesting significant levels of assembled gap junctions, but the same Cx43 species typically were less abundant or undetectable in tumor cells. The expression of Cx26 protein was not detected in these three tumor cell lines by immunofluorescence (data not show). To examine GJIC in human breast tumor cells we microinjected live cells with 5% Lucifer Yellow and examined intercellular dye coupling (TableI). Cx43- and Cx26-deficient HBL100 cells exhibited only trace amounts of dye coupling to the first order cells (Table I). Moreover, although MDA-MB-231 cells expressed Cx43 this connexin was not assembled into gap junctions as only 6% of the microinjected cells exhibited dye transfer, and this was further restricted to first order cells (Table I). Interestingly, even though a significant number of Hs578T cells expressed Cx43 that was assembled into gap junction plaques these cells were only 47% coupled, and dye spreading was restricted to first order cells (Table I). These results suggest that this tumor cell line is quite heterogeneous with respect to GJIC. NRK cells were found to be extensively dye coupled (Table I). Together these findings suggest that each of these tumor cell lines is significantly or extensively defective in GJIC.Table IDefective GJIC and differential rescue of GJIC in human breast tumor cellsNo. cells injectedNo. injections with dye coupling% Injections with dye couplingDegree of dye transferNRK13131003rd orderHs578T6229471st orderMDA-MB-23147361st orderMDA-MB-231 vCx43602237Only one contacting cell (22%)1st order (15%)MDA-MB-231 vCx26781722Only one contacting cell (14%)1st order (8%)HBL-1008711131st orderHBL-100 vCx433935902nd and 3rd orderHBL-100 vCx266049822nd and 3rd orderSingle cells in 90% confluent cultures were microinjected with 5% Lucifer Yellow.

Open table in a new tab Single cells in 90% confluent cultures were microinjected with 5% Lucifer Yellow. The percentage of microinjected cells demonstrating dye transfer and the extent of dye transfer was assessed. In an attempt to rescue the defects in GJIC we used AP2 retroviruses encoding Cx26 or Cx43 to deliver these genes into HBL100 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The retroviral system enabled an efficient targeting of exogenous connexins to both tumor cell lines with >90% of cell populations expressing the transgene after three rounds of infection. In HBL100 cells, exogenous Cx43 (Fig. 2 B) or Cx26 (Fig.2 D) were assembled into gap junction plaques (arrows). Immunoblots revealed that Cx43 was detected in the cells infected by the Cx43 gene-containing AP2 virus but not in the control cells (Fig. 2 F). Compared with their wild-type cell counterparts, introduction of either Cx43 or Cx26 genes efficiently rescued GJIC in HBL100 cells, resulting in over 80% of the microinjected cells exhibiting dye transfer to second or third order cells (Table I). In contrast, when Cx43 or Cx26 were expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, these cells remained poorly coupled with dye spreading to only 8–15% of first order cells (Table I). In many cases, Lucifer Yellow spread to only one neighboring cell when MDA-MB-231 overexpressed Cx43 or Cx26 (Fig.3, D and E). The majority of overexpressed Cx43 in MDA-MB-231 cells remained as a single band likely representing the unphosphorylated species of Cx43 (Fig.2 E), although slower migrating phosphorylated species of Cx43 also were evident. Immunolabeling studies revealed that the exogenous Cx43 (Fig. 2 A) or Cx26 (Fig. 2 C) were localized aberrantly to perinuclear intracellular compartments. Double immunolabeling revealed that Cx26 (Fig. 3, A andC) colocalized with the lysosomal-associated membrane protein LAMP-1 (Fig. 3, B and C), demonstrating that Cx26 had been delivered to lysosomes. Likewise, we showed previously that Cx43 was delivered to lysosomes in MDA-MB-231 cells (26Qin H. Shao Q. Belliveau D.J. Laird D.W. Cell Comm. & Adhesion. 2001; 8: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Consequently, the defect in MDA-MB-231 cells is not in connexin synthesis but rather in their inability to assemble functional gap junctions efficiently in vitro. In the absence of functional gap junctions, we examined the role of connexins in tumor growth control in vitro by comparing the growth kinetics of connexin-overexpressing cells and their control counterparts, including wild-type cells or cells infected with the retroviral vector that did not encode a connexin. When MDA-MB-231 cells were engineered to overexpress Cx43 or Cx26 in vitro these cells exhibited growth characteristics similar to the control (Fig. 4 A). However, a dramatic inhibition of tumor growth was observed when Cx43- or Cx26-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells were implanted into mammary fat pad of the nude mice (Fig. 4 B). In addition to the smaller tumor volume, in comparison to controls, it took more time for connexin-expressing cells to develop tumors, and in over 50% of the mice tested no measurable tumor developed. Xenograph removal and immunostaining for Cx43 revealed that Cx43-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells retained the connexin within the cell and did not assemble gap junction plaques at cell-cell interfaces (Fig. 5,C and D), whereas only low levels of detectable Cx43 immunostaining were observed on sections of control MDA-MB-231 xenoplant tumors (Fig. 5 B). As a positive control, punctate Cx43-positive gap junctions were readily observed between cardiac myocytes (Fig. 5 A, arrows). Together these results suggest that connexins exert tumor suppression properties in MDA-MB-231 cells by a mechanism that is independent of appreciable GJIC.Figure 5Overexpressed Cx43 did not form gap junctionsin vivo. Punctate gap junctions at cell-cell interfaces (arrows) were observed readily in control mouse cardiac tissue immunolabeled for Cx43 (A). However, only low levels of intracellular Cx43 were detected in sections of control MDA-MB-231 xenoplants (B). Likewise, low (C) and high (D) magnification images revealed only intracellular Cx43 in sections of MDA-MB-231 tumors overexpressing Cx43. No detectable punctate Cx43 gap junction plaques were observed in these tumors. Bar, 10 μmView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the molecular mechanism of a possible GJIC-independent tumor suppression by connexins we performed DNA array analysis to screen several well characterized genes related to either tumor growth or metastasis. FGFR3 mRNA was found to be down-regulated by 2.6-fold in Cx43-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison to the control (Fig.6, A and B,boxed). Similarly, Cx26-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells down-regulated FGFR3 by 2.3-fold in comparison to the control (data not shown). In accordance with DNA array data, Western blots revealed that FGFR3 protein expression was reduced significantly by 30–50% in MDA-MB-231 cells engineered to overexpress Cx43 or Cx26 in comparison to both wild-type and viral control cells (Fig. 6,C and D). The DNA array analysis also revealed that the chemokine receptor, CXCR4, was down-regulated in Cx43-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 6, A andB; compare spots in positions 3 and4 from the left in the bottom row of each array); however, the lack of a suitable antibody prevented this finding from being confirmed at the protein level by Western blots. Although normal human breast epithelial stem cells have been reported to lack GJIC (27Trosko J.E. Chang C.C. Wilson M.R. Upham B. Hayashi T. Wade M.

Interestingly, epithelial cells derived from normal human breast may exhibit GJIC and a susceptibility to growth control or a GJIC deficiency and may be more sensitive to growth stimulation (28Kao C.Y. Nomata K. Oakley C.S. Welsch C.W. Chang C.C. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggesting a correlation between growth control and GJIC. It has been reported that there is a down-regulation of connexins, gap junctions, and/or impaired GJIC in human breast carcinomas and in other neoplastic cells (12Yamasaki H. Omori Y. Krutovskikh V.

https://openalex.org/W2087083058,"We have reported previously (Michikawa, M., Fan, Q.-W., Isobe, I., and Yanagisawa, K. (2000) J. Neurochem. 74, 1008–1016) that exogenously added recombinant human apolipoprotein E (apoE) promotes cholesterol release in an isoform-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this isoform-dependent promotion of cholesterol release remains undetermined. In this study, we demonstrate that the cholesterol release is mediated by endogenously synthesized and secreted apoE isoforms and clarify the mechanism underlying this apoE isoform-dependent cholesterol release using cultured astrocytes prepared from human apoE3 and apoE4 knock-in mice. Cholesterol and phospholipids were released into the culture media, resulting in the generation of two types of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles; one was associated with apoE and the other with apoJ. The amount of cholesterol released into the culture media from the apoE3-expressing astrocytes was ∼2.5-fold greater than that from apoE4-expressing astrocytes. In contrast, the amount of apoE3 released in association with the HDL-like particles was similar to that of apoE4, and the sizes of the HDL-like particles released from apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes were similar. The molar ratios of cholesterol to apoE in the HDL fraction of the culture media of apoE3- and apoE4-expressing astrocytes were 250 ± 6.0 and 119 ± 5.1, respectively. These data indicate that apoE3 has an ability to generate similarly sized lipid particles with less number of apoE molecules than apoE4, suggesting that apoE3-expressing astrocytes can supply more cholesterol to neurons than apoE4-expressing astrocytes. These findings provide a new insight into the issue concerning the putative alteration of apoE-related cholesterol metabolism in Alzheimer's disease."

However, the molecular structure and function of this protein has remained unclear. Here we cloned and identified a novel isoform of AC133, which we named AC133-2. In comparison to the reported AC133 cDNA, which is referred to herein as AC133-1, a small exon of 27 nucleotides is deleted in AC133-2 by alternative mRNA splicing. Similar to the previously characterized AC133 antigen, recombinant AC133-2 expressed in 293 cells was glycosylated and transported to plasma membrane. AC133-2 mRNA was found predominant in a variety of human fetal tissue, adult tissues, and several carcinomas. In contrast, AC133-1 mRNA was more prominent in fetal brain and adult skeletal muscle but was not detected in fetal liver and kidney, adult pancreas, kidney, and placenta, suggesting different roles for the two isoforms in fetal development and mature organ homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that AC133-2 is the isoform expressed on hematopoietic stem cells derived from fetal liver, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. The results indicate that AC133-2, not AC133-1, has been the cell surface antigen recognized by anti-AC133 monoclonal antibodies that are used for isolation of hematopoietic stem cells. To further investigate its expression in other stem cell populations, we found that AC133-2 co-expressed with β1 integrin in the basal layer of human neonatal epidermis. AC133-2+/β1 integrin+ cells proliferated and differentiated in culture, which coincided with a loss of AC133-2 and gain in a terminal differentiation marker involucrin.

Human AC133 antigen is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of ∼120 kDa. Based on its predicted amino acid sequence, AC133 contains an extracellular N terminus, two large extracellular loops, five transmembrane domains, two small cysteine-rich cytoplasmic loops, and a cytoplasmic C terminus (1Miraglia S.

Retinoblastoma cell line WERI-RB-1 and irradiated 3T3 mouse embryo cells were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). 293 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Yashushi Numaguchi (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). All primers were synthesized by Sigma Gynosis. Unless otherwise mentioned, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Sequence homology searches in the GenBankTM data base were performed using the most recent version of BLAST software at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

The genomic DNA fragment was sequenced in the Molecular Core Facility (Children's Hospital, Boston). The coding region of AC133-2 was amplified from cDNA of WERI-RB-1, lung carcinoma LX-1, fetal liver, or adult kidney tissues by PCR using forward primer, 5′-GCACCTCGAGTGGAGGATCTTGCTAGCTATG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GAGT GGTACCGAATGTTGTGATGGGCTTGTC-3′. The PCR condition used was at 94 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. Authenticity was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Molecular Core Facility, Dana Farber Cancer Institute). The PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen) at restriction sites XhoI and KpnI. To separate the two AC133 isoforms, forward primer, 5′-CAGAAGGCA TATGAATCC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CACCACATTTGTTACAGC-3′, were used in PCR to amplify short DNA fragments. Hot-start PCR was then performed for 35 cycles using Taq and Pfu DNA polymerases at 1:5 enzymatic activity ratio. Each PCR cycle was performed at 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s followed by an extension at 72 °C for 5 min after cycling. PCR products were analyzed in ethidium bromide-stained 3% MetaPhor-agarose gels (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications). cDNA panels of multiple human tissues and tumors were from CLONTECH. 293 cells transfected with AC133-2 cDNA construct were trypsinized and resuspended in PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Single cell suspensions were labeled with PE-conjugated mAb AC133/2 (Miltenyi Biotech) or PE-conjugated mouse IgG1 isotype control (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then analyzed or sorted on a FACSVantage SE flow cytometer (BD PharMingen). 10,000–50,000 events were acquired in list mode with CellQuest software (BD PharMingen). The list mode files were analyzed on a PC computer with WinMDI 2.8 software (The Scripps Research Institute). Nearly confluent 293 cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with 2 μg of the AC133-2 cDNA and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were carefully rinsed with PBS and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. WERI-RB-1 cells grown in suspension were directly plated on glass coverslips in 50 μl of PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 20 min before fixation. Incubation and washes were done directly on the coverslips. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (9Corbeil D. Roper K. Hellwig A. Tavian M. Miraglia S. Watt S.M.

Cells were observed with a Bio-Rad uRadience 2000/Nikon Eclipse 800 (Bio-Rad Laboratories) confocal laser-scanning scope using Bio-Rad LaserSharp2000 imaging software. The images shown were prepared from confocal image files using Adobe Photoshop 5.5 software. Biotinylation was performed as reported previously (9Corbeil D. Roper K. Hellwig A. Tavian M. Miraglia S. Watt S.M. Simmons P.J. Peault B. Buck D.W. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5512-5520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) with the exception that sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin (Pierce) was used. Protein concentrations of the cell lysates were quantified by Bio-Rad protein assay. 400 μg protein was incubated with mAb AC133/2 at 10 μg/ml overnight. Immune complexes were collected with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 4–12% gradient gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blot was blocked with 5% low fat milk, 0.3% Tween 20. Biotinylated proteins were identified by horseradish-conjugated NeutrAvidin (Pierce) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagent (KPL). Frozen LX-1 tumor fragment was acquired from the National Cancer Institute. 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 size tumor cubes were implanted in the axillary region of 6 to ∼7-week-old nude mice (13Ovejera A.A. Houchen D.P. Catane R. Sheridan M.A. Muggia F.M. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 3220-3224PubMed Google Scholar). After 3–4 weeks, ∼2 × 2 × 2 cm3 size tumors were dissected. Tumor tissue was minced in PBS and gently homogenized in a 50-ml tube (Fisher Scientific) with a fitted pestle. Tumor cells were then sequentially filtered though 100 and 40 μm of mesh. Single tumor cells were subjected to flow cytometry or cell surface biotinylation followed by immunoblotting to detect AC133-2 protein. Human neonatal foreskins were obtained from routine circumcisions performed at Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, MA) under an Internal Review Board-approved protocol. Epidermal basal keratinocytes were isolated as reported previously (14Jones P. Harper S. Watt F.M. Cell. 1995; 80: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Isolated cells were labeled with PE- or FITC-conjugated isotype controls, PE-conjugated AC133/2 mAb, or FITC-conjugated CD29, a mAb against β1 integrin subunits (Beckman Coulter). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry or indirect immunofluorescence staining. AC133-2+ or AC133-2+/β1 integrin+ cells purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were cultured on a feeder layer of 3T3 mouse embryo cells using the method of Rheinwald (15Rheinwald J.G. Baserga R. Cell Growth and Division: A Practical Approach. Oxford Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989: 81-94Google Scholar). To monitor the loss of AC133-2 expression, very confluent keratinocytes were further grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 containing 2% fetal bovine serum for a week before FACS analysis. For indirect immunofluorescence staining, cultured keratinocytes were plated on glass coverslips pre-seeded with irradiated 3T3 cells and grown under the same conditions as described above. Confluent cells were fixed and stained with anti-keratin (clone LP34) or anti-involucrin (NeoMarkers) as described previously (16Kraling B.M. Bischoff J. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1998; 34: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To make a Northern blot cDNA probe for human AC133 antigen, we amplified a N-terminal fragment of 458 bp (GenBankTM accession number AF027208) by RT-PCR from the retinoblastoma cell line WERI-RB-1 from which the first AC133 cDNA was cloned (1Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Arkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Waller E.K. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequencing data revealed that one of four clones had a deletion of a 27-bp segment corresponding to positions 314–340. This did not result in a frameshift in the coding sequence but created a 9-amino acid deletion (Fig. 1, A and B). Using RT-PCR with primers flanking the start and stop codons of AC133, a novel full-length cDNA clone was isolated and sequenced. This novel sequence, which will be referred to as human AC133-2, differs from the previously published AC133, which will be referred to as human AC133-1, by the 27-bp deletion (Fig. 1 A). A literature search revealed that a homologous mouse sequence to human AC133-1 had previously been reported by Maraglia et al. (17Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Buck D. Blood. 1998; 91: 4390-4391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was named as mouse AC133, which will be referred to as mouse prominin-1 in this paper (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, this sequence is 27-bp longer than the previously characterized mouse prominin, which will be referred to here as prominin-2. The relationship between the gene structure of prominin-1 and -2 has not been reported. The corresponding nine amino acids in human AC133-1 are highly homologous to that in mouse prominin-1 (Fig. 1 B). Human AC133-2 and mouse prominin-2 encode proteins that lack a 9-amino acid segment at same location in the N-terminal extracellular region just proximal to the first transmembrane domain. The deletion produces no significant change in the predicated membrane-spanning domains of AC133-2 compared with AC133-1 by hydrophobicity analysis (data not shown). The discovery of human AC133-2 and the existence of its mouse counterpart prominin-2 indicate that AC133-2 may be a result of alternative mRNA splicing. Exons of AC133 gene were identified by aligning human genomic sequences with AC133-1 or -2 cDNA sequences using the data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. We found two human chromosome 4 clones, C0024K08 and RP11-45J21 (GenBankTMaccession numbers AC005598 and AC067999), of which each contains most of the exons of the AC133 gene. Exons were also confirmed by blasting AC133-2 cDNA against the recently completed human genome. The AC133 gene consists of 27 exons spanning a region of ∼200 kb. Exon 1 contains the 5′-untranslated region and the start methionine, whereas the stop codon is in exon 26. Exons 1–26 range in size from 27 to 217 bp, whereas exon 27 is considerably larger containing at least 1143 bp. All exon/intron junctions conform to the GT-donor/AG-acceptor rule (18Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3284) Google Scholar) (Table I). Our analysis revealed that AC133-2 resulted from a deletion of exon 3 of 27 nucleotides flanked by splice acceptor and donor consensus sequences (Fig. 1 C). Using a forward primer in the intron prior to exon 3 and a reverse primer in exon 4, exon 3 and its surrounding intron sequences were amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA and confirmed by DNA sequencing. These results indicate that AC133-2 is a novel alternatively spliced isoform of AC133-1. To determine whether AC133-2 cDNA could be transported to the cell surface as shown for the endogenous AC133 (1Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Arkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Waller E.K. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed the protein product and its cellular localization in 293 cells transfected with AC133-2 cDNA. Cell surface AC133-2 was detected by flow cytometry (Fig. 2 A) using a commercially available PE-conjugated mAb designated AC133/2 (1Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Arkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Waller E.K. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Yin A.H. Miraglia S. Zanjani E.D. Almeida-Porada G. Ogawa M. Leary A.G. Olweus J. Kearney J. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More than 95% transfected cells expressed AC133-2. In contrast, mock-transfected 293 cells did not show any immunoreactivity to this antibody (data not shown). The localization of AC133-2 to plasma membrane of transfected 293 cells was observed by indirect immunofluorescence staining with the same antibody followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 2 B, a and b). The cellular localization of endogenous AC133 antigen in retinoblastoma cell line WERI-RB-1 was similar (Fig. 2 B, c and d). Cell surface distribution of AC133-2 was further confirmed by biotinylation of the intact cells followed by immunoprecipitation with mAb AC133/2. Recombinant AC133-2 was detected by NeutrAvidin blotting as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼115 kDa (Fig. 2 C). Deglycosylation with peptide N-glycosidase F yielded a ∼94 kDa band, which is the predicted size from AC133-2 amino acid sequence. The 9-amino acid deletion in AC133-2 should not affect the degree of N-glycosylation compared with AC133-1, because none of the consensus sequences for glycosylation sites is within the deleted region. Similar to AC133-1, the transcript of AC133-2 is ∼4 kb as determined by Northern blotting (data not shown). However, the size difference between AC133-1 and -2 mRNA is too small to be resolved by this technique. Specific primers flanking the truncated sequences were used to amplify AC133-1 fragment of 180 bp and AC133-2 of 153 bp in the same PCR reaction. The two fragments were then separated electrophoretically on a 3% MetaPhor-agarose gel. The identity of the cDNA fragments was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To determine the constitutive mRNA expression profiles of AC133 isoforms, PCR was performed on commercially available cDNA panels. Because the multiple tissue cDNA (CLONTECH) panels have been normalized against several housekeeping genes, the mRNA expression level among samples can be directly compared. AC133-2 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in a variety of human fetal and adult tissues (Fig. 3 A). It was predominant in fetal liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and heart as well as adult pancreas, kidney, liver, lung, and placenta. AC133-1 mRNA was not detectable in fetal liver and kidney, adult kidney, pancreas, and placenta. However, AC133-1 was abundantly expressed in fetal brain but poorly expressed in adult brain. In skeletal muscle and heart, the relative abundance of the two isoforms was reversed between fetal and adult tissues. Interestingly, AC133-2, but not AC133-1, was high in fetal liver, low in bone marrow, and barely detectable in peripheral blood (Fig. 3 B). These relative levels of AC133-2 mRNA in hematopoietic tissue are consistent with reported AC133 protein levels (3Gehling U.M. Ergun S. Schumacher U. Wagener C. Pantel K. Otte M. Schuch G. Schafhausen P. Mende T. Kilic N. Kluge K. Schafer B. Hossfeld D.K. Fiedler W. Blood. 2000; 95: 3106-3112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low levels of AC133-1 transcripts were observed only after AC133+ cells were purified from fetal liver, bone marrow, cord blood, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor immobilized peripheral blood using the mAb AC133/2-conjugated magnetic beads. The ratios of AC133-1 and AC133-2 transcripts were identical among these samples (data not shown). Also, AC133-2 was easily detected in several tumors such as lung carcinoma LX-1, pancreatic adenocarcinoma GI-103, colon adenocarcinoma CX-1 and breast carcinoma GI-101 (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, AC133-1 was strongly expressed in WERI-RB-1 retinoblastoma cells, the tumor cells from which this isoform was originally cloned. Because of the lack of isoform-specific antibody, we have not investigated the protein tissue distribution profile of AC133 isoforms. We know that AC133-2 protein is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells in which AC133-2 is the predominant transcript (Fig. 3 B), because AC133+ cells have been isolated from hematopoietic tissues (2Yin A.H.

Hicklin D.J. Witte L. Moore M.A. Rafii S. Blood. 2000; 95: 952-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To show that AC133-2 protein is expressed in vivo in other tissues, we analyzed cell surface expression of this protein in lung carcinoma LX-1. LX-1 tumors expressed only the AC133-2 mRNA (Fig. 3 C). Mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood and WERI-RB-1 retinoblastoma cells were included as a negative and a positive control, respectively. Flow cytometric analysis showed that ∼80% LX-1 tumor cells were recognized by AC133 mAb (Fig. 4 B). In addition, the endogenous AC133-2 protein was detected by immunoprecipitation from biotinylated LX-1 tumor cells (Fig. 4 D). AC133-2 appeared as a single band with a similar molecular mass to the AC133 antigen expressed in WREI-RB-1 cells. The relative protein levels of AC133-2 in LX-1 and WERI-RB-1 determined by immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry were similar. The wide tissue distribution of AC133-2 (Fig. 3, A and B) suggests that the utility of this antigen for stem cell analysis and purification is not restricted to hematopoietic tissue. To determine whether AC133-2 was expressed in other stem cell niches, we chose to isolate basal keratinocytes from human neonatal foreskin epidermis because of its availability. Epidermal stem cells reside in the basal layer of epidermis in which cells mainly express α2β1, α3β1, and α5β1 integrins (5Quirici N. Soligo D. Caneva L. Servida F. Bossolasco P. Deliliers L. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 115: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Only AC133-2 was detected in epidermal cells (Fig. 5 A, lane 1). Flow cytometric analysis showed that over 90% of the isolated epidermal cells were positive for β1 integrin subunits, indicating they were basal cells (Fig. 5 B). In the total isolated cell population, the percentage of AC133-2+ cells was the same as that for the AC133-2+/β1integrin+ cells, suggesting that AC33-2+ cells were a subpopulation of the epidermal basal cells (data not shown). Approximately 10% basal cells were positive for PE-conjugated mAb AC133/2 and FITC-conjugated mAb against β1 integrin subunits. Previous studies have shown that approximately the same numbers of the basal keratinocytes have stem cell properties (19Withers H.R. Radiat. Res. 1967; 32: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Jones P.H. Watt F.M Cell. 1993; 73: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). The expression of AC133-2 was then further confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence staining of FACS-sorted AC133+ cells with a different mAb (Fig. 5 C). Over 95% cells were AC133-2-positive and were also β1 integrin-positive (data not shown). To test whether isolated AC133+ cells could proliferate and differentiate in culture, isolated epidermal basal cells were either labeled with PE-conjugated AC133 mAb or doubled with PE-conjugated AC133 mAb and FITC-conjugated anti-β1 integrin mAb, and then AC133+ cells or AC133+/β1integrin+ cells were isolated by two rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Fig. 6 B, left panel). The positive cells formed visible colonies as early as 6–10 days after culture initiation on irradiated 3T3 embryonic cells. Colonies formed faster among AC133+ cells than they did among AC133+/β1 integrin+ cells, perhaps because antibody binding to β1 integrins decreased the efficiency of cell attachment through integrin receptors. Cells continued to grow, formed tightly adherent epithelioid colonies, and underwent stratification, which was difficult to see under phase-contrast microscopy (Fig. 6 Aa) but was manifested by indirect immunofluorescence staining with a mAb to anti-keratin 5, 6, and 18 (Fig. 6 Ac). Clearly, all cultured cells were keratinocytes. The flat-stratified cells in layers also expressed involucrin (Fig. 6 Ad), a terminal differentiation marker (20Jones P.H. Watt F.M Cell. 1993; 73: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Isotype-matched control monoclonal Ab did not show any immune reactivity (Fig. 6 Ab). Flow cytometry showed that AC133-2 expression was completely lost in cultured basal cells after confluent keratinocytes were grown in basal medium containing low serum for 6 days (Fig. 6 B, right panel). This was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence staining or Western blotting with anti-AC133 mAb (data not shown). In this study, we have identified and characterized a second isoform of AC133. As a result of mRNA alternative splicing, the novel isoform, AC133-2, differs from the previously identified isoform, AC133-1, by the absence of exon 3. As a consequence, AC133-2 encodes 856 amino acid residues with a deletion of nine amino acids in the N-terminal extracellular domain. How might loss of the nine amino acids affect the structure and function of AC133-2? The nine amino acid deletion does not interfere with the signal peptide, asparagine-linked glycosylation sites, or any of the five transmembrane domains. Similar to the endogenous human AC133-1 antigen (1Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Arkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Waller E.K. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse prominin-2 (12Weigmann A. Corbeil D. Hellwig A. Huttner W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12425-124330Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), human AC133-2 can localize to the plasma membrane, indicating a possible role in cell-cell interactions or ligand-receptor interactions. Whether the two isoforms are functionally redundant or serve distinct functions remains unclear, because little is known regarding their biological functions. Nevertheless, because both AC133 isoforms contain five tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, the biological functions may depend on an interaction with an unknown ligand(s) as well as intracellular proteins and thereby relay AC133 isoform-specific signaling. We speculate that the deletion in the AC133-2 isoform may affect ligand binding affinity and specificity and therefore delineate its biological function from AC133-1. The mRNA distribution profiles of AC133-1 and -2 suggest distinct roles for the two isoforms in development and mature organ homeostasis. Whereas AC133-2 was expressed ubiquitously, AC133-1 was not detectable in fetal liver and kidney, adult pancreas, kidney and placenta. AC133-1 was strongly expressed in fetal brain but not in adult brain tissue, implying a possible role for AC133-1 in fetal brain development. AC133-2 was more abundant than AC133-1 in fetal skeletal muscle and heart but much less abundant than AC133-1 in adult counterparts, suggesting AC133-2 may be involved in fetal development in these tissues. In addition, we found that AC133-2 was strongly expressed in four poorly differentiated human tumors including lung carcinoma LX-1, pancreatic adenocarcinoma GI-103, colon adenocarcinoma CX-1, and breast carcinoma GI-101 but not in prostatic adenocarcinoma PC3, lung carcinoma GI-117, ovarian carcinoma GI-102, and colon adenocarcinoma GI-112. A variable expression of AC133 isoforms in tumors may be associated with the degree of differentiation of the tumor cells. In vivo, AC133 antigen was first detected in hematopoietic CD34bright cells using a mAb raised against CD34+ cells from human blood (1Miraglia S. Godfrey W. Yin A.H. Arkins K. Warnke R. Holden J.T. Bray R.A. Waller E.K. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AC133-1 cDNA was originally cloned from a retinoblastoma cell line WERI-RB-1 and has been the only reported transcript encoding AC133 antigen (2Yin A.H. Miraglia S. Zanjani E.D. Almeida-Porada G. Ogawa M. Leary A.G. Olweus J. Kearney J. Buck D.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here for the first time, we demonstrate that AC133-2 transcript is predominant in hematopoietic tissue, whereas AC133-1 is the predominant transcript in WERI-RB-1 cells (Fig. 3). Based on abundant evidence in the literature (2Yin A.H. Miraglia S. Zanjani E.D. Almeida-Porada G. Ogawa M. Leary A.G. Olweus J. Kearney J. Buck D.W.

Blood. 2000; 95: 952-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it appears that the AC133-2 isoform has been the antigen recognized in many Ab-based selection protocols to isolate hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells. In addition, we show that AC133-2 is expressed in human stem cell niches other than hematopoietic tissue. Approximately 10% basal keratinocytes in foreskin epidermis co-express AC133-2 and β1 integrin subunits, consistent with previously reported numbers of stem cells in human skin epidermis (14Jones P. Harper S. Watt F.M. Cell. 1995; 80: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). We showed that isolated AC133-2+/β1 integrin+cells from the epidermal basal layer can self-renew and differentiate in culture, and that AC133-2 is lost as the cells differentiate into non-stratified and stratified involucrin-expressing keratinocytes. These results demonstrate that AC133-2 serves as a marker of undifferentiated cells. Previously, the isolation of skin epidermal stem cells relied solely on β1 integrin as a marker, which cannot efficiently differentiate stem cells and other basal cells because of a subtle difference in their integrin levels (20Jones P.H. Watt F.M Cell. 1993; 73: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Therefore, AC133-2 together with β1 integrin may facilitate direct isolation of purer populations of epidermal stem cells. The expression pattern of AC133-2 suggests that stem cells/progenitor cells are present in more human fetal and adult tissues than previously thought. Accumulating evidence supports the concept that the utility of AC133 antigen as a stem cell marker is not restricted to hematopoietic tissue (8Uchida N. Buck D.W., He, D. Reitsma M.J. Masek M.

Our study supports that AC133 antigen is an excellent marker for stem and progenitor cells when used in combination with other tissue- and cell-specific markers. The AC133-2 isoform may be of significance in the analysis and isolation of stem and progenitor cells from specific tissues and thereby facilitate functional characterization and application to tissue-engineering and regenerative medicine. In conclusion, we have isolated and characterized a novel isoform of the AC133 antigen. Our findings clarify the sequence identities of the two isoforms on the surface of stem cells and progenitor cells. The discovery of AC133-2 isoform increases complexity of this novel family of five transmembrane cell surface glycoproteins. Further investigation is needed to unmask the biological significance of these two AC133 isoforms.

https://openalex.org/W1995230392,"In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus function as the major biological clock. SCN-dependent rhythms of physiology and behavior are regulated by changes in the environmental light cycle. Currently, the second messenger signaling events that couple photic input to clock entrainment have yet to be well characterized. Recent work has revealed that photic stimulation during the night triggers rapid activation of the p42/44 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the SCN. The MAPK signal transduction pathway is a potent regulator of numerous classes of transcription factors and has been shown to play a role in certain forms of neuronal plasticity. These observations led us to examine the role of the MAPK pathway in clock entrainment. Here we report that pharmacological disruption of light-induced MAPK pathway activation in the SCN uncouples photic input from clock entrainment, as assessed by locomotor activity phase. In the absence of photic stimulation, transient disruption of MAPK signaling in the SCN did not alter clock-timing properties. We also report that signaling via the Ca2+/calmodulin kinase pathway functions upstream of the MAPK pathway, coupling light to activation of the MAPK pathway. Together these results delineate key intracellular signaling events that underlie light-induced clock entrainment. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus function as the major biological clock. SCN-dependent rhythms of physiology and behavior are regulated by changes in the environmental light cycle. Currently, the second messenger signaling events that couple photic input to clock entrainment have yet to be well characterized. Recent work has revealed that photic stimulation during the night triggers rapid activation of the p42/44 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the SCN. The MAPK signal transduction pathway is a potent regulator of numerous classes of transcription factors and has been shown to play a role in certain forms of neuronal plasticity.

The biological rhythm generated by the SCN regulates, with near 24-h periodicity, a wide array of cellular, physiological, and behavioral processes (1Miller J.D. Morin L.P. Schwartz W.J. Moore R.Y. Sleep. 1996; 19: 641-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 2Turek F.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 49-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the SCN rhythm generator can be entrained by a number of external stimuli, of which light is the most potent. This ability to entrain the clock to photic cues allows animals to adjust their biological rhythms to changes in the external environment.Recent work has revealed that photic stimulation affects clock timing in part by triggering rapid transcriptional activation in the SCN (3Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar). In turn, these newly transcribed gene products are postulated to regulate the clock by resetting a transcription/translation feedback loop that generates the rhythm. Although many postsynaptic events including glutamate receptor activation and increased intracellular calcium have been shown to couple light to entrainment of the circadian clock (4Colwell C.S. Foster R.G. Menaker M. Brain Res. 1991; 554: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Mintz E.M. Marvel C.L. Gillespie C.F. Price K.M. Albers H.E. J.

Nature. 1998; 394: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), there is still significant debate regarding the second messenger signaling events that trigger rapid transcriptional activation in the SCN. Along these lines, several reports have shown that the infusion of broad spectrum calcium/calmodulin kinase (CaMK) inhibitors into the SCN attenuates light-induced phase shifting of the circadian clock (7Yokota S. Yamamoto M. Moriya T. Akiyama M. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Shibata S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Golombek D.A. Ralph M.R. Neurosci.

Likewise, a role for nitric oxide and protein kinase G has been implicated in light-induced resetting of the clock (11Mathur A. Golombek D.A. Ralph M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: R1031-R1036PubMed Google Scholar, 12Weber E.T. Gannon R.L. Rea M.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 197: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Ding J.M. Chen D. Weber E.T.

More recently, attention has turned to the p42/44 mitogen protein kinase (MAPK) pathway as a potential signaling intermediate coupling light to clock entrainment.Interest in this pathway results, in part, from recent studies showing that brief exposure to light during the subjective night, but not during the subjective day, triggers rapid and robust activation of the MAPK pathway in the SCN (16Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Furthermore, light-induced activation of ERK colocalizes with and regulates the activation state of the cAMP response element-binding protein (16Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), a transcription factor proposed to be a key intermediate coupling photic stimulation to the rapid expression of clock genes (17Hida A. Koike N. Hirose M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Tei H. Genomics. 2000; 65: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Additionally, in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts disruption of TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)-induced activation of the MAPK pathway blocks circadian gene oscillations (18Akashi M. Nishida E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 645-649PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the MAPK pathway fulfills several criteria likely to be essential for light entrainment of the clock: it is rapidly activated by light, its activation is restricted to the subjective night, and the pathway couples to transcription factor activation. These observations raise the possibility that the MAPK pathway plays a central role in the set of signaling events that couple photic input to clock entrainment. Here we report that pharmacological disruption of light-induced MAPK pathway activation in the SCN uncouples photic input from clock entrainment. The observations presented here reveal that the MAPK cascade functions as an SCN clock input pathway.RESULTSTo confirm that photic stimulation elicits MAPK pathway activation in the SCN, animals were exposed to light (10 min, 50 lux) during the early night (3 h after lights off; zeitgeber time 15, ZT 15) and then immediately sacrificed. SCN tissue was processed using immunofluorescent staining techniques for the activated (i.e. dually phosphorylated, Thr202/Tyr204) form of erk-1 and erk-2 (here, collectively referred to as P-ERK). This dual phosphorylation event is essential for ERK enzymatic activity and is a marker for MAPK pathway activation. Relative to control animals not exposed to light, photic stimulation triggered robust activation of the MAPK cascade in the SCN (Fig. 1A). P-ERK was observed from the ventral to dorsal regions of the SCN. Western blotting was also used to examine the activation of ERK (Fig. 1, B and C). Light triggered the expression of the catalytically active form of ERK in the SCN; modest levels of activation were observed in tissue isolated from the lateral hypothalamus and piriform cortex. Collectively, these data reveal that photic stimulation triggers robust SCN-specific activation of the MAPK pathway.To disrupt MAPK signaling in the SCN we employed a ventricular infusion technique. Mice were infused with the specific MEK inhibitor U0126 (10 nmol/μl) (20Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F.

To determine whether U0126 administration disrupted MAPK pathway activation infused animals were light flashed and sacrificed, and SCN-containing brain sections were processed for expression of activated ERK (Fig. 1, A and B). Infusion of the MEK inhibitor significantly attenuated (typically >90%) light-induced ERK activation in the SCN. Similar results were obtained with a second MEK inhibitor, SL-327 (data not shown).For the behavioral studies described below, it was imperative to determine the diffusion pattern of U0126 in the brain. Thus, to track its penetration into periventricular brain regions, mice were infused with the MEK inhibitor and then, 45 min later, intraperitoneally injected with kainate (to trigger MAPK pathway activation throughout the brain) and exposed to light (15 min, 50 lux; ZT 16). A region lacking ERK activation centered around the infusion needle delineates the area of U0126 diffusion and inhibition. Using this technique, we found that U0126 did not broadly diffuse (Fig.2B) and that inhibition was limited to within ∼400 μm of the ventricle. Importantly, relative to the control animals (Fig. 2A), U0126 infusion blocked ERK activation within the SCN. U0126-mediated inhibition of MAPK pathway activation was transient, lasting for ∼90 min (data not shown). These data reveal that U0126 infusion is localized to the periventricular brain regions. Thus, the area of inhibition is not so great as to raise considerable doubt about the site of action.FIG. 2MEK inhibition in vivo. To track the diffusion pattern of U0126 from the ventricle into the brain, mice were infused with the MEK inhibitor (10 nmol/μl) and then, 45 min later, intraperitoneally injected with kainate (30 mg/kg). Mice also were exposed to light (50 lux, 10 min; ZT 16). By infusing the MEK inhibitor and then stimulating MAPK pathway activation, we were able to track U0126 diffusion. Using immunohistochemical analysis of ERK activation, we found that U0126 did not diffuse broadly from the infusion site (B, dashed line denotes the approximate area of MAPK pathway inhibition; the arrowidentifies the location of guide cannula/infusion needle tip). The vehicle-infused control animal (A, intraperitoneally injection with kainate, light exposure) exhibited high levels of ERK activation in periventricular regions including the SCN.Bar, 500 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Wheel-running activity was used as a circadian output to address the contribution of the MAPK pathway to light entrainment of the clock. Animals were initially entrained to an LD cycle for 14 days and then released into total darkness (DD). In the absence of external timing cues, overt circadian rhythms are governed by the SCN clock. After 9–12 days in DD animals were infused with either drug vehicle or U0126 at CT 14.25 and exposed to light 45 min later (50 lux, 10 min). A marked phase delay in the onset of wheel-running activity was elicited by light exposure after vehicle infusion (Fig.3, A, B, and D). In striking contrast, U0126 infusion blunted this light-induced phase shift, indicating that disruption of signaling via the MAPK pathway uncouples light from clock entrainment. U0126 infusion reduced the light-induced phase shift by >90% in 60% of mice (n = 20). In the absence of photic stimulation, the acute disruption of MAPK signaling did not influence clock timing (Fig.3, C and D). In a preliminary round of experimentation (data not shown) we found that the infusion of lower concentrations (<2 nmol/μl) of U0126 that partially blocked (40–60%) light-induced ERK activation did not dramatically alter the phase shifting effects of light.FIG. 3Disruption of light-induced MAPK pathway activation uncouples light from circadian clock entrainment. A, representative double-plotted actogram from a mouse initially entrained to a standard LD cycle was transferred to DD and then infused with drug vehicle (Me2SO) 45 min before light (50 lux, 10 min) exposure at CT 15 (asterisk). 11 days later the same animal was infused with U0126 (10 nmol/μl) and exposed to light (asterisk).

Similar to the experiments described above, infusion of SL-327 (50 μg/μl) significantly attenuated light-induced phase shifting of the clock (Figs. 3D and4). As with U0126, the infusion of SL-327 in the absence of photic stimulation did not significantly alter clock phase. Collectively these data identify a role for the MAPK pathway as a signaling intermediate coupling light to clock entrainment.FIG. 4Infusion of the MEK inhibitor SL-327 depresses light-induced phase shifting of the circadian clock. A representative double-plotted actogram from a dark-adapted mouse initially infused with drug vehicle (Me2SO) 45 min before light (50 lux, 10 min) exposure at CT 15 (asterisk). 13 days later the animal was infused with SL-327 (50 μg/μl) and exposed to light (asterisk).

Lett. 1997; 227: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the MAPK and CaMK pathways work in parallel to affect downstream targets. Another possibility is that these pathways are also in series, with the CaMK pathway triggering MAPK cascade activation (21Wu G.Y. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To assess whether CaMKs trigger MAPK activation in the SCN, mice were infused with the broad acting CaMK inhibitor KN 62 at ZT 14.25. 45 min after infusion, mice were exposed to light and sacrificed, and SCN-containing sections were processed for ERK activation. Relative to vehicle-infused animals, the infusion of the CaMK inhibitor significantly attenuated light-induced ERK activation (Fig. 5). In the absence of light, the low basal expression of activated ERK was not significantly affected by CaMK inhibition. Together, these data suggest that CaMK signaling functions as an upstream regulator of the MAPK pathway in the SCN.FIG. 5Disruption of CaMK signaling in the SCN attenuates light-induced activation of the MAPK pathway.

Error bars, S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DiscussionSignaling via the MAPK pathway in the central nervous system has recently become a topic of intense interests. For example, a role for the MAPK pathway has been identified in such diverse central nervous system processes as addiction, programmed cell death, and learning and memory (24Valjent E. Corvol J.C. Pages C. Besson M.J. Maldonado R. Caboche J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8701-8709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hetman M. Xia Z. Acta Neurobiol. Exp. 2000; 60: 531-545PubMed Google Scholar, 26Impey S. Obrietan K. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1999; 23: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Along these lines, stimulus protocols that trigger hippocampal long-term potentiation also activate the MAPK pathway (27English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24329-24332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). More importantly, disruption of signaling via the MAPK cascade uncouples stimulation from transcriptionally dependent forms of long-term potentiation formation, indicating a causal link between the MAPK pathway and stimulus-dependent strengthening of synaptic efficacy (28English J.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19103-19106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 29Impey S. Obrietan K. Wong S.T. Poser S. Yano S. Wayman G. Deloulme J.C. Chan G. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 869-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar)Perhaps the most dramatic example of MAPK pathway activation in the central nervous system is observed in the SCN following photic stimulation (16Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Interest in this pathway is derived in part from its rapid activation following photic stimulation, its phase-dependent activation, and its ability to potently regulate the activation state of numerous classes of transcription factors. These observations led us to examine the contribution of signaling via the MAPK pathway to light-induced clock entrainment. Here we show that disruption of light-induced MAPK pathway activation in the SCN blocks photic input from clock entrainment.In a large percentage of animals, infusion of U0126 led to a dramatic (>90%) reduction in light-induced phase shifting, suggesting that the MAPK pathway plays a central role in the light-entrainment process. However, a second group of animals exhibited varying amounts of inhibition (20–90%) of light-induced phase shifting of the circadian clock. One interpretation of this result is that infusion did not lead to effective MAPK pathway inhibition. Indeed, we have observed that partial inhibition (40–60%) of light-induced ERK activation did not dramatically affect the ability of light to entrain the clock. Given that the MAPK pathway signal is amplified both spatially and temporally downstream of MEK (the target of U0126 and SL-327), partial MEK inhibition may have only marginal effects on cellular targets of the MAPK pathway. This difference in the efficacy of inhibition may explain the discrepancy between our work and that of Yokota et al.(7Yokota S. Yamamoto M. Moriya T. Akiyama M. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Shibata S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).It should be noted that U0126 is a recently developed inhibitor that specifically antagonizes the activity of both MEK 1 and MEK 2 without detectable effects on other kinases such as PKA, PKC, Raf, ERK, MSK I, and JNK (20Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3919) Google Scholar). Likewise, the U0126 analog SL-327 is specific to MEK 1 and MEK 2 and does not have measurable effects on PKA, PKC, and CaMK II (20Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol.

Mem. 1999; 6: 478-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Furthermore, based on a number of studies that have utilized an infusion protocol to disrupt MAPK signaling in the central nervous system, it appears that the MAPK pathway specifically affects transcriptionally dependent forms of neuronal plasticity and does not alter such fundamental neurophysiological processes as sensory, motivational, or motor abilities (32Berman D.E. Hazvi S. Rosenblum K. Seger R. Dudai Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10037-10044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Blum S. Moore A.N. Adams F. Dash P.K. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3535-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even the intraperitoneal injection of SL327 did not affect sensory perception or arousal (34Atkins C.M. Selcher J.C. Petraitis J.J. Trzaskos J.M. Sweatt J.D. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Importantly, no long-term residual effects of MAPK pathway disruption were observed in any of these studies.The activation state of the MAPK pathway varies as a function of circadian time in the SCN, showing maximal stimulation during the subjective day and low levels of activity during the early to mid-subjective night (16Obrietan K. Impey S. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This observation raised the possibility that the infusion of U0126 may alter clock phase and therefore preclude us from determining the sight of drug action. However, we found that the acute disruption of MAPK activation did not alter circadian clock timing, indicating that the effects on light-induced phase shifts resulted from inhibition of the photic input signal. The absence of an effect of U0126 infusion on clock phase might result from the transient nature of U0126 inhibition and the relatively low basal level of MAPK pathway activation during the time of the infusion (CT 14.25).A number of studies have implicated a variety of kinase pathways in the light entrainment process. For example, disruption of nitric oxide synthetase activity blocks phase shifting (14Ding J.M. Faiman L.E. Hurst W.J. Kuriashkina L.R. Gillette M.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 667-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, a role for the CaMKs has also been identified (7Yokota S. Yamamoto M. Moriya T. Akiyama M. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Shibata S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Golombek D.A. Ralph M.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 192: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Golombek D.A.

Lett. 1997; 227: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in several model systems, signaling via nitric oxide and CaMKs have been shown to function as upstream regulators of the MAPK pathway (22Watt W.C. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2047-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 35Yun H.Y. Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). With respect to CaMK signaling, our data support this model. We observed that infusion of the CaMK inhibitor KN 62 attenuated light-induced ERK activation. Similar results have been found in hippocampal neurons, where depolarization-induced ERK activation is attenuated by disruption of CaMK activation (21Wu G.Y. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2808-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism by which CaMK signaling leads to MAPK pathway activation involves CaMK II inhibition of the GTPase-activating protein p135 SynGAP (36Chen H.J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). It is important to note that we are not ruling out other mechanisms by which CaMK signaling affects the clock. Indeed, it is probable that CaMK IV plays a significant role in coupling light to transcription factor activation in the SCN. Thus, there are likely to be a number of essential signaling pathways that function in an orchestrated manner to couple light to clock entrainment.Signaling via the MAPK pathway has become an area of investigation for circadian biologists working in both invertebrate and vertebrate model systems (37Ko G.Y., Ko, M.L. Dryer S.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 38Williams J.A., Su, H.S. Bernards A. Field J. Sehgal A.

Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, MAPK signaling has been shown to function as an output pathway from the clock (37Ko G.Y., Ko, M.L. Dryer S.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and may play a role in the core clock timing mechanism (41Sanada K. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 267-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The observations described here are unique in that they reveal a role for the MAPK cascade as a signaling intermediate coupling photic input to circadian clock entrainment. Within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN)1 resides an endogenous oscillator that functions as the master biological clock. The biological rhythm generated by the SCN regulates, with near 24-h periodicity, a wide array of cellular, physiological, and behavioral processes (1Miller J.D. Morin L.P. Schwartz W.J. Moore R.Y. Sleep. 1996; 19: 641-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 2Turek F.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 49-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the SCN rhythm generator can be entrained by a number of external stimuli, of which light is the most potent. This ability to entrain the clock to photic cues allows animals to adjust their biological rhythms to changes in the external environment. Recent work has revealed that photic stimulation affects clock timing in part by triggering rapid transcriptional activation in the SCN (3Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar). In turn, these newly transcribed gene products are postulated to regulate the clock by resetting a transcription/translation feedback loop that generates the rhythm. Although many postsynaptic events including glutamate receptor activation and increased intracellular calcium have been shown to couple light to entrainment of the circadian clock (4Colwell C.S.

https://openalex.org/W1990811421,"In an attempt to find podocyte-expressed proteins that may interact with the tight junction protein MAGI-1, we screened a glomerulus-enriched cDNA library with a probe consisting of both WW domains of MAGI-1. One of the isolated clones contained two WW domain-binding motifs and was identified as a portion of the actin-bundling protein synaptopodin. In vitro binding assays confirmed this interaction between MAGI-1 and synaptopodin and identified the second WW domain of MAGI-1 to be responsible for the interaction. MAGI-1 and synaptopodin can also interact in vivo, as they can be immunoprecipitated together from HEK293 cell lysates. Another actin-bundling protein that is found in glomerular podocytes and shown to be mutated in an inheritable form of glomerulosclerosis is α-actinin-4. We show that α-actinin-4 is also capable of binding to MAGI-1 in in vitro binding assays and that this interaction is mediated by the fifth PDZ domain of MAGI-1 binding to the C terminus of α-actinin-4. Exogenously expressed synaptopodin and α-actinin-4 were found to colocalize along with endogenous MAGI-1 at the tight junction of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The interaction and colocalization of MAGI-1 with two actin-bundling proteins suggest that MAGI-1 may play a role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics within polarized epithelial cells.

Mature differentiated podocytes are highly specialized cells whose many functions, including regulating glomerular permselectivity (1Tryggvason K. Wartiovaara J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2001; 10: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), depend on an elaborate and complex cellular morphology (2Mundel P. Kriz W. Anat. Embryol. 1995; 192: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Because of this distinct morphology, podocytes can be divided into three functionally and structurally different segments: cell body, major processes, and foot processes. Structural differences in the segments of podocytes are reflected in their different cytoskeletal foundation, with foot processes exhibiting an actin-based contractile apparatus (3Drenckhahn D. Franke R.P. Lab. Invest. 1988; 59: 673-682PubMed Google Scholar). In glomerular diseases with massive proteinuria, podocytes may undergo dramatic structural changes resulting in loss of foot process architecture and eventual effacement. Under some conditions, these changes are reversible, which illustrates the morphological dynamics of foot processes. Although the regulation of foot process dynamics is poorly understood at this time, it is apparent that an alteration in the actin-based cytoskeleton is a fundamental aspect. Two actin-bundling proteins have recently drawn attention because of their expression within the podocyte. One of them, synaptopodin, was initially identified as an antigen to a monoclonal antibody that showed association with the actin system of podocyte foot processes (4Mundel P. Gilbert P. Kriz W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Its eventual cloning and characterization showed no significant homology to any other known proteins, and it was found in the dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons in addition to renal podocytes (5Mundel P. Heid H.W. Mundel T.M. Kruger M. Reiser J. Kriz W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The finding that synaptopodin associates with specialized actin-based compartments of renal podocytes and neuronal dendrites suggests that synaptopodin may play a role in the structural and/or functional dynamics of these cellular extensions. The non-muscle isoform of α-actinin is another actin-associated protein shown to be expressed in the podocyte (3Drenckhahn D. Franke R.P. Lab. Invest. 1988; 59: 673-682PubMed Google Scholar, 6Smoyer W.E. Mundel P. Gupta A. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F150-F157PubMed Google Scholar,7Kurihara H. Anderson J.M. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F514-F524PubMed Google Scholar). Of the two known non-muscle isoforms of α-actinin (α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4), α-actinin-4 was recently identified as the isoform that is present in human podocytes, and mutations in the gene encoding this protein are responsible for an autosomal dominant form of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)1 in humans (8Kaplan J.M. Kim S.H. North K.N. Rennke H. Correia L.A. Tong H.-Q. Mathis B.J. Rodriguez-Perez J.-C. Allen P.G. Beggs A.H. Pollak M.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4 are found in cultured mouse podocytes, but they exhibit differences in their spatial distribution within these cells (9Welsch T. Endlich N. Kriz W. Endlich K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F769-F777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Originally identified as the antigen to a monoclonal antibody that exhibited a unique immunohistochemical reactivity, α-actinin-4 has also been implicated in cell motility and carcinogenesis (10Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y. Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We recently reported on the localization of a protein, MAGI-1, in the podocytes of rat kidneys (11Patrie K.M. Drescher A.J. Goyal M. Wiggins R.C. Margolis B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 667-677PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that MAGI-1 was found in the membrane fraction of mouse glomerular preparations and that it was insensitive to extraction with Triton X-100, which suggested to us that MAGI-1 might be associated with the actin cytoskeleton. The MAGI proteins consist of three members that together make up a subfamily of a larger group of proteins known as the MAGUKs. MAGUK proteins share a common structural organization and are proposed to function as molecular scaffolds within cells (for recent reviews, see Refs. 12Dimitratos S.D. Woods D.F. Stathakis D.G. Bryant P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar and 13Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Avila-Flores A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 4: 315-324Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Many of them are found at special subcellular regions such as postsynaptic densities within neurons as well as the tight and adherens junctions of epithelial cells and are believed to play a role in the structure and function of these specialized complexes. The MAGUK proteins exhibit a unique grouping of protein-protein interaction domains that is inverted in the MAGI family of proteins. In addition, two WW domains in the MAGI proteins take the place of the SH3 (Src homology 3) domain observed in the conventional MAGUKs. WW domains are small protein interaction modules of 30–40 amino acids in length and are often found in association with other protein interaction domains such as phosphotyrosine-binding and PDZ domains (14Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 15Ilsley J.L. Sudol M. Winder S.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). They have been found to bind polyproline-rich peptide sequences and can be classified into five distinct groups based upon current understanding of their binding specificity. Group I WW domains, like those found in the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4 and Yes-associated protein, have been extensively studied and recognize “PPXY” motifs (where P is proline, X is any amino acid, and Y is tyrosine; often referred to as PY motifs) (16Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The binding of a number of proteins to the PDZ domains and guanylate kinase domain of MAGI-1, MAGI-2, and MAGI-3 has been reported; however, there is a paucity of data on proteins that may interact with the WW domains of MAGI proteins. Although a screen to identify interacting partners for theDRPLA (dentatorubral andpallidoluysian atrophy) gene product atrophin-1 isolated partial cDNAs containing the WW domains of MAGI-1 (AIP-3) and MAGI-2 (AIP-1) (18Wood J.D. Yuan J. Margolis R.L. Colomer V. Duan K. Kushi J. Kaminsky Z. Kleiderlein J.J. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), no further data on these interactions have yet been reported. In an initial attempt to discover potential binding partners for MAGI-1 that are found in renal glomeruli, we screened a cDNA expression library made from glomerulus-enriched preparations of mouse kidney with the WW domains of MAGI-1. Among the clones that were isolated was a partial cDNA coding for a region of the actin-bundling protein synaptopodin that contained both of its PY motifs. We provide further data strengthening this interaction of synaptopodin with MAGI-1 using various binding assays and colocalization analysis. In addition, we examined the potential of α-actinin-4, another actin-bundling protein whose C terminus contains a PDZ domain-binding motif, to bind to MAGI-1. We found that α-actinin-4 was also capable of binding to one of the PDZ domains of MAGI-1. Thus, two actin-bundling proteins have been found to bind to the MAGUK protein MAGI-1, and we discuss the potential relevance of these interactions. The following MAGI-1 constructs were obtained using reverse transcription-PCR on total RNA derived from mouse glomerulus-enriched preparations: full-length MAGI-1 (amino acids 1–1220; numbering of all MAGI-1 constructs is based on the full-length cDNA obtained from kidney and glomerular libraries previously described (11Patrie K.M. Drescher A.J. Goyal M. Wiggins R.C. Margolis B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 667-677PubMed Google Scholar)), which contains the shorter “A” C-terminal tail as previously described (19Dobrosotskaya I. Guy R.K. James G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31589-31597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar); MAGI-1 WW12 (amino acids 219–416); MAGI-1 WW1 (amino acids 219–334); MAGI-1 WW2 (amino acids 315–414); MAGI-1 PDZ123 (amino acids 404–919); MAGI-1 PDZ234 (amino acids 607–1081); MAGI-1 PDZ45 (amino acids 905–1455), which contains the “C” C-terminal tail (19Dobrosotskaya I. Guy R.K. James G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31589-31597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar); MAGI-1 PDZ4 (amino acids 905–1081); and MAGI-1 PDZ5 (amino acids 1011–1202). The PCR products were initially cloned into the TA cloning vector pGEM-T-Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and then subcloned into pGSTag (20Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar) and pRK5-Myc (21Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) for production of GST fusion proteins in bacterial cells and expression of Myc-tagged proteins in mammalian cells, respectively. A human synaptopodin construct containing the two PPXY motifs (amino acids 294–350) was obtained by PCR of a human expressed sequence tag cDNA using forward primer 5′-CATGGTGGAAAGGAGGATGATGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ACTTGGGGTCGGAGCTGGGATAC-3′. The PCR product was first cloned into pGEM-T-Easy and then subcloned into pGSTag to make GST-synpoPY. A full-length mouse synaptopodin cDNA in the expression vector pRC/CMV was subcloned into HA3-pcDNA3.1(−) (HA-synaptopodin) by PCR such that the flanking 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences in the original cDNA were deleted. This HA-tagged synaptopodin construct was further subcloned into pTRE2hyg for use in the Tet-Off inducible system. The T7 epitope-tagged mouse Nedd4 expression construct (T-Nedd4) was a kind gift from Dr. D. Rotin (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). The C-terminal tail of α-actinin-4 was obtained by PCR of a rat expressed sequence tag cDNA and consisted of the last 19 amino acids including the endogenous stop codon. The α-actinin-4 tail was cloned into pGSTag to make GST-α-actinin-4. A full-length mouse α-actinin-4 cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. S. R. Vincent, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) was cloned into the HA3-pcDNA3.1(−) vector to make HA-α-actinin-4. Anti-Myc antibody 9E10 was obtained from mouse ascites fluid produced at the Hybridoma Core Facility of the University of Michigan. Anti-T7 antibody (T7·Tag) was from Novagen (Madison, WI). Anti-synaptopodin polyclonal antibody NT was described elsewhere (5Mundel P. Heid H.W. Mundel T.M. Kruger M. Reiser J. Kriz W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Anti-MAGI-1 polyclonal antibody UM209 was described previously (11Patrie K.M. Drescher A.J. Goyal M. Wiggins R.C. Margolis B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 667-677PubMed Google Scholar). An additional anti-MAGI-1 polyclonal antibody (UM223) was produced in rabbits using a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 905–1081 (containing the “b” variant of PDZ4 (11Patrie K.M. Drescher A.J. Goyal M. Wiggins R.C. Margolis B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 667-677PubMed Google Scholar)) of MAGI-1 and then affinity-purified. Anti-HA antibodies 3F10 (rat monoclonal) and 12CA5 (mouse monoclonal) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Mouse anti-α-actinin-4 monoclonal antibody NCC-Lu-632 was a kind gift from Dr. T. Yamada (National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan). Mouse anti-ZO-1 monoclonal antibody ZO1-1A12 was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Total RNA isolated from glomerulus-enriched preparations of mouse kidneys was used to make a random-primed cDNA library, which was then modified at its ends with EcoRI adapters. The cDNA library was then cloned into λSCREEN phage arms containing EcoRI sites at their ends (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The library had an initial complexity of ∼1 × 106 plaque-forming units/ml prior to one round of amplification. The GST fusion protein GST-MAGI-1 WW12 (see above) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and used as a probe to screen the library (the pGSTag expression vector has a protein kinase A phosphorylation site placed in between the GST sequence and the downstream protein of interest). Plating and transferring of plaques to nitrocellulose membranes were performed as described in the λSCREEN manual. The resulting membranes were blocked in Farwestern buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% nonfat dry milk, and 0.02% sodium azide) for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation, followed by a 2-h incubation with the 32P-labeled probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml of Farwestern buffer) at room temperature. The membranes were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline supplemented with Triton X-100 to 0.1% and then three times with Tris-buffered saline (5 min each wash) at room temperature. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. HEK293 cells and MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Tet-Off MDCK cells (CLONTECH) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 μg/ml puromycin, and 40 ng/ml doxycycline. For transient transfections, HEK293 cells at 50–80% confluency in 10-cm dishes were transfected with epitope-tagged expression constructs using either a calcium phosphate precipitation method or Superfect transfection reagent (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). Cells were allowed to recover for 24–48 h prior to harvesting for lysates. Stable cell lines of MDCK and Tet-Off MDCK cells were obtained by transfecting them at 50% confluency in 6-cm dishes with Superfect transfection reagent. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were trypsinized, and one-tenth of the volume of trypsinized cells was transferred to 15-cm dishes containing complete medium supplemented with Geneticin (Invitrogen) at 600 μg/ml or hygromycin B at 200 μg/ml for the Tet-Off cells. After ∼10 days in selection medium, colonies were isolated and subsequently assayed for expression by immunofluorescence. Adult mouse brains were placed in a Dounce homogenizer along with high salt Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) plus protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and homogenized with 25–30 strokes. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and stored at −20 °C until used. Glomerular extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) plus protease inhibitors as described previously (11Patrie K.M. Drescher A.J. Goyal M. Wiggins R.C. Margolis B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 667-677PubMed Google Scholar). Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped in 400 μl of Triton lysis buffer (with 150 mm NaCl), transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, vortexed briefly, and incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and stored at −20 °C until used. Cells transfected with synaptopodin expression constructs either alone or with other expression constructs were scraped and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer plus protease inhibitors. GST fusion proteins were produced in DH5α bacteria cells as previously described (21Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Tissue or cell lysates were combined with ∼10 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads and incubated on a rocker at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then washed twice with ice-cold HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) and once with ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Forty microliters of 1× SDS sample buffer was added to the beads and then placed at 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins eluted off of the beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with the appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies or protein A-horseradish peroxidase. Blots were then developed with chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to x-ray film. For immunoprecipitations, lysates (200–300 μl) from transfected HEK293 cells were brought up to a total volume of 1 ml with HNTG buffer and rocked overnight at 4 °C with anti-Myc antibodies. The following day, protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the samples and rocked for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed and processed in the same manner as the GST pull-down samples above. Wild-type MDCK cells or stable MDCK cell lines were seeded onto Transwell filters (Corning, Inc., Cambridge, MA) and allowed to reach confluency. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and then solubilized with 1% SDS in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Blocking was performed in 50% goat serum diluted in PBS for 2 h at 30 °C in a humidified chamber. Primary antibodies were diluted in 2% goat serum in PBS (PBS-G) and placed on cells overnight at 30 °C in a humidified chamber. The filters were washed three times with PBS-G (5 min each wash). Fluorophore-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-rat, or anti-mouse secondary antibodies diluted in PGS-G were incubated on the filters for 2 h at 30 °C in a humidified chamber. The filters were then washed four times with PBS-G and mounted on glass slides with ProLong Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Immunofluorescence images were obtained with a confocal microscope. In an effort to identify proteins in the kidney that interact with the MAGUK protein MAGI-1, we screened a cDNA expression library made from a glomerulus-enriched preparation of mouse kidneys. The library was probed with a radiolabeled GST fusion protein containing both WW domains of mouse MAGI-1. Screening a total of ∼1 × 106 plaque-forming units with the probe resulted in the initial isolation of 11 independent clones that survived additional rounds of selection and purification. Sequencing of the cDNA inserts from the 11 clones showed that five of them represented the extreme C terminus of β-dystroglycan; four exhibited high identity to the human cDNA KIAA0989; and the last two were single isolates of WBP2 and synaptopodin, resulting in a total of four distinct protein fragments. Although the inserts contain partial cDNAs, all but one of the four encoded proteins have PY motifs as expected (the protein showing a high identity to KIAA0989 lacked a conventional PY motif). Both synaptopodin and dystroglycan are known to be present in podocytes and could potentially serve as in vivo binding partners for MAGI-1. However, because we have found MAGI-1 in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of glomerulus-enriched preparations (11Patrie K.M. Drescher A.J. Goyal M. Wiggins R.C. Margolis B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 667-677PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests an association with the actin cytoskeleton, we chose to focus our attention on synaptopodin at this time. The expression clone of mouse synaptopodin (clone 11.2) contained a region of this protein encompassing amino acids 255–379 and harboring two potential WW domain-binding PY motifs. These two PY motifs are conserved in human synaptopodin, suggesting that they may have some physiological relevance. In parallel with the screening of the glomerular expression library, we had PCR-amplified a region of human synaptopodin containing its PY motifs (amino acids 294–350) and fused it to GST to perform analysis on proteins that could potentially bind to the WW domains of MAGI-1. This fusion protein, GST-synpoPY, was then used in a pull-down assay with lysates from HEK293 cells expressing a Myc-tagged portion of MAGI-1 containing only its two WW domains, Myc-MAGI-1 WW12. We found that the GST-synpoPY fusion protein was able to pull-down Myc-MAGI-1 WW12, whereas GST alone could not (Fig.1A). In addition, GST-synpoPY was also capable of pulling down a Myc-tagged full-length MAGI-1 construct expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B) as well as endogenous MAGI-1 from mouse brain lysates (Fig. 1C). The multiple bands observed for MAGI-1 in mouse brain lysates are most likely due to different forms of the protein that we (11Patrie K.M. Drescher A.J. Goyal M. Wiggins R.C. Margolis B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 667-677PubMed Google Scholar) and others (19Dobrosotskaya I. Guy R.K. James G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31589-31597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) have observed previously in brain and other tissues as well. A protein whose WW domains are very similar to those of MAGI-1 is the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4. We expressed a T7-tagged full-length Nedd4 construct in HEK293 cells and tested its ability to interact with the GST-synpoPY fusion protein. GST-synpoPY was unable to pull-down Nedd4 from cell lysates in this assay (Fig. 1D), indicating that the PY motifs of synaptopodin do not interact with any of the three WW domains of this Nedd4 construct. In reciprocal experiments, the GST-MAGI-1 WW12 fusion protein that was used as a probe to screen the glomerular cDNA library was utilized in GST pull-down assays with lysates from HEK293 cells expressing a HA-tagged full-length mouse synaptopodin construct. As shown in Fig. 1E, GST-MAGI-1 WW12 could pull-down HA-synaptopodin from the lysates, whereas GST alone could not. In addition, using the same assay on mouse brain lysates, we found that GST-MAGI-1 WW12 could pull-down endogenous synaptopodin (Fig. 1F). We have observed that lysates from brain contain a form of synaptopodin that is much more stable than the one found in glomerular lysates; and therefore, brain lysates were used as our source of synaptopodin in these binding assays. These data suggest that a region in synaptopodin containing its two conserved PY motifs can interact with the WW domains in MAGI-1. Moreover, this interaction appears to be somewhat specific, as this region of synaptopodin is unable to interact with Nedd4, whose WW domains show a high degree of similarity to those in MAGI-1. Because MAGI-1 contains two WW domains and synaptopodin harbors two PY motifs that are relatively close together, it is conceivable that both WW domains of MAGI-1 bind to the two PY motifs of synaptopodin, thereby providing an enhanced interaction, or alternatively, that only one WW domain of MAGI-1 is responsible for this interaction. To address this possibility, we performed a Farwestern assay using the WW domains of MAGI-1 together or by themselves as 32P-labeled probes (Fig. 2A). As expected, the probe with both WW domains of MAGI-1 bound to the GST-synpoPY fusion protein (Fig. 2B, second lane). When the second WW domain of MAGI-1 was used as a probe, nearly the same degree of binding to GST-synpoPY was observed (Fig. 2B, sixth lane). In contrast, the degree to which the first WW domain bound to GST-synpoPY was significantly less and is most likely only residual in nature (Fig. 2B, fourth lane). None of the three probes bound to GST alone (Fig. 2B, first, third, and fifth lanes). Taken together, these data indicate that MAGI-1 and synaptopodin interact with each other in a direct manner in vitro and that the second WW domain of MAGI-1 specifically mediates this interaction. To investigate whether MAGI-1 and synaptopodin interact in an in vivo situation, HEK293 cells were transfected with full-length expression constructs of Myc-tagged MAGI-1 and HA-tagged synaptopodin either alone or together, and the resulting cell lysates were used in co-immunoprecipitation assays. Using anti-Myc antibodies to precipitate MAGI-1 from the cell lysates, we found that synaptopodin was precipitated along with MAGI-1 in cells transfected with both expression constructs (Fig. 2C), indicating that these two proteins are able to interact together in cells. We have previously shown that MAGI-1 is found in Triton X-100-insoluble fractions of mouse glomerular preparations (11Patrie K.M. Drescher A.J. Goyal M. Wiggins R.C. Margolis B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 667-677PubMed Google Scholar), which is suggestive of MAGI-1 association with the actin cytoskeleton. Although we have not ascertained whether MAGI-1 is present in lipid rafts, the above finding that MAGI-1 interacts with the actin-bundling protein synaptopodin lends support to its actin cytoskeletal association as the reason for its Triton X-100 insolubility. An additional actin-bundling protein expressed in the glomerular podocytes is one of the non-muscle isoforms of α-actinin, viz. α-actinin-4. Recent data provide evidence that mutations in the gene for α-actinin-4 cause a hereditary form of FSGS in humans. In addition, both non-muscle isoforms of α-actinin, α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4, contain a consensus binding motif for PDZ domains (ESDL) at their extreme C termini. These data and observations provided the impetus to determine whether α-actinin-4 could interact with any of the PDZ domains of MAGI-1. For our initial binding assay, the last 19 amino acids of α-actinin-4 (Fig. 3A) were fused to GST and used in pull-down assays with lysates of HEK293 cells expressing different Myc-tagged constructs of MAGI-1. The GST-α-actinin-4 fusion protein was able to efficiently pull-down full-length MAGI-1, whereas GST alone was not (Fig. 3B). Of the MAGI-1 deletion constructs tested, only those with an intact fifth PDZ domain retained binding to GST-α-actinin-4 (Fig. 3B). We next performed the rec"
https://openalex.org/W2051070936,"Recently, a human ortholog of mouse calcyclin (S100A6)-binding protein (CacyBP) called SIP (Siah-1-interacting protein) was shown to be a component of a novel ubiquitinylation pathway regulating β-catenin degradation (Matsuzawa, S., and Reed, J. C. (2001) Mol. Cell 7, 915–926). In murine brain, CacyBP/SIP is expressed at a high level, but S100A6 is expressed at a very low level. Consequently we carried out experiments to determine if CacyBP/SIP binds to other S100 proteins in this tissue. Using CacyBP/SIP affinity chromatography, we found that S100B from the brain extract binds to CacyBP/SIP in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Using a nitrocellulose overlay assay with 125I-CacyBP/SIP and CacyBP/SIP affinity chromatography, we found that this protein binds purified S100A1, S100A6, S100A12, S100B, and S100P but not S100A4, calbindin D9k, parvalbumin, and calmodulin. The interaction of S100 proteins with CacyBP/SIP occurs via its C-terminal fragment (residues 155–229). Co-immunoprecipitation of CacyBP/SIP with S100B from brain and with S100A6 from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells suggests that these interactions are physiologically relevant and that the ubiquitinylation complex involving CacyBP/SIP might be regulated by S100 proteins. Recently, a human ortholog of mouse calcyclin (S100A6)-binding protein (CacyBP) called SIP (Siah-1-interacting protein) was shown to be a component of a novel ubiquitinylation pathway regulating β-catenin degradation (Matsuzawa, S., and Reed, J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) that possess two EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs and share about 20–80% homology in amino acid sequence. S100 proteins exhibit cell- and tissue-specific expression, and some of them bind not only Ca2+ but also Zn2+ and Cu2+ (4Heizmann C.W. Cox A.J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Members of the S100 family bind different protein targets that modulate their activity. It has been shown that S100 proteins regulate the activity of glycogen phosphorylase (5Zimmer D.B. Dubuisson J.G.

Agneletti A.L. Donato R. Neuroscience. 2000; 99: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that S100 proteins, through binding to annexins, might be involved in exocytosis/endocytosis processes (14Sopkova-de Oliveira Santos J. Oling F.K. Rety S. Brisson A. Smith J.C. Lewit-Bentley A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In some cases S100 proteins inhibit phosphorylation of cellular proteins by binding to the substrate. For instance S100B inhibits the phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor p53 (15Scotto Ch. Deloulme J.Ch. Rousseau D. Chambaz E. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). S100A6 was originally identified in Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT)1 cells (16Kuznicki J. Filipek A Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 663-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Kuznicki J. Filipek A. Hunziker P. Huber S. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 951-0956Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It was later established that S100A6 is mainly present in epithelial cells and fibroblasts (18Kuznicki J. Kordowska J. Puzianowska M. Wozniewicz B.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We found that in EAT cells of epithelial origin, S100A6 bound a protein with a molecular mass of about 30 kDa in a Ca2+-dependent manner (19Filipek A. Wojda U. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Since this 30-kDa protein had no sequence similarity to any other known protein, we named it calcyclin-binding protein (CacyBP) (20Filipek A. Kuznicki J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The region of CacyBP (residues 178–229) that binds S100A6 was then identified, and the dissociation constant of the complex was measured (21Nowotny M. Bhattacharya S. Filipek A. Krezel A.M. Chazin W. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31178-311822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Also, the Ca2+-dependent translocation of CacyBP/SIP within the cell was reported (22Filipek A. Jastrzebska B. Nowotny M. Kwiatkowska K. Hetman M. Surmacz L. Wyroba E. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21103-21109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, a human protein called SIP (Siah-1-interacting protein), a component of a novel ubiquitinylation pathway regulating β-catenin degradation, was described (1Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). SIP shares 93% sequence identity with CacyBP, strongly implying that SIP is a human ortholog of mouse CacyBP. We found by Northern and Western blot analysis that CacyBP/SIP is present in different rat tissues, with highest expression in the brain (23Jastrzebska B. Filipek A. Nowicka D. Kaczmarek L. Kuźnicki J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since a very low expression of S100A6 is observed in this tissue we designed a series of experiments to discover other S100-like protein ligands of CacyBP/SIP in the brain. Newborn calf serum, fetal bovine serum, trypsin-EDTA solution, penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen; leupeptin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, soybean trypsin inhibitor, dithiothreitol, bovine serum albumin, monoclonal antibodies against histidine tags, monoclonal antibodies against S100A1, S100A6, and S100B, and anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma. Other chemicals used were obtained from the companies indicated in the text. pET28a-CacyBP/SIP was prepared from pET30-CacyBP/SIP vector (21Nowotny M. Bhattacharya S. Filipek A. Krezel A.M. Chazin W. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31178-311822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The coding region of CacyBP/SIP was excised from pET30-CacyBP/SIP using NdeI andEcoRI restriction enzymes, gel purified, and ligated with pET28a vector linearized using the same restriction endonucleases. The ligation product was transformed into Escherichia coli(TOP10F′), and the presence of the insert was confirmed using the colony PCR method. pET28a-CacyBP/SIP-(155–229) was prepared from pET28a-CacyBP/SIP using inside-out PCR with Pfu polymerase. The PCR product was ligated and transformed into E. coli(TOP10F′). Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. pET28a-CacyBP/SIP or pET28a-CacyBP/SIP-(155–229) plasmid was introduced into E. coli (BL21). For protein expression, bacteria were cultured until the OD600 reached ∼0.7, and IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. After 3 h bacteria were harvested and lysed by sonication in buffer A (50 mmNaH2PO3, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) containing protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 27,000 × gand then applied to a Ni-NTA-agarose column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A, and then the protein was eluted with a gradient of buffer A/buffer B (50 mmNaH2PO3, 300 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole). For some experiments the histidine tag was cleaved off using biotinylated thrombin (Novagen). Approximately 1 unit of the protease was used per milligram of purified histidine-tagged protein. The reaction was carried out in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and 150 mmNaCl at room temperature for 16 h. Protease was removed using streptavidin-agarose beads (Novagen). S100A6 was purified as described by Filipeket al. (24Filipek A. Wojda U. Lesniak W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). S100A1, S100B, and calmodulin were obtained from Sigma. Parvalbumin was a gift from Dr. C. W. Heizmann (Department of Pediatrics, University of Zurich); calbindin D9k was a gift from Dr. S. Linse (Physical Chemistry, Lund University); S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 were gifts from Dr. C. Kerkhoff (University of Muenster); S100P was a gift from Dr. V. Gerke (University of Muenster); and S100A4 was a gift from Dr. R. Barraclough (University of Liverpool). The rat brain was washed in phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized with a polytron homogenizer (6000 rpm) in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (CompleteTM). The extract was then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The pellet was removed, and the supernatant was applied on CacyBP/SIP affinity resin (described below) after addition of CaCl2 to a final concentration of 2 mm. Unbound proteins were washed away, and bound proteins were eluted in a buffer containing 4 mmEGTA. The EGTA-eluted fraction was analyzed on SDS gels and then on a Western blot developed with antibodies against S100A1, S100A6, or S100B. EAT cells were obtained as previously described (16Kuznicki J. Filipek A Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 663-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized with a polytron homogenizer (6000 rpm) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (CompleteTM). Protein extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C at 12,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge, and supernatants were used for the immunoprecipitation assay. In the same way, extract and supernatant from the brain were prepared. Protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Recombinant S100 proteins were incubated with histidine-tagged CacyBP/SIP in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and CaCl2 (2 mm) or EGTA (4 mm) for 30 min at room temperature. Next, monoclonal antibodies against histidine tag were added, and incubation was continued for another 1 h at room temperature. The solutions were then incubated with protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the beads were washed four times in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mm CaCl2 or 4 mm EGTA. The proteins bound to protein G-agarose were eluted with a buffer containing 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.7 and precipitated with cold acetone. The pellets were then solubilized in SDS sample buffer and applied on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to the nitrocellulose sheets and analyzed with affinity-purified antibodies against CacyBP/SIP and monoclonal antibodies against either S100A1, S100A6, S100B, or calbindin D9k. The blots were developed with the chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce). Supernatants from cell or tissue extracts were incubated with CaCl2 (2 mm) or EGTA (4 mm) for 30 min at room temperature. Then, monoclonal antibodies against S100B or S100A6 were added. Incubation with antibodies and subsequently with protein G-agarose, and then washing, elution, transfer, and Western blot of immunoprecipitated proteins were performed as described above. CacyBP/SIP was125I-labeled with iodogen reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The, purified Ca2+-binding proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the polyacrylamide gel to the nitrocellulose sheets. The blots were washed three times for 10 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and blocked for 2 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2 (or 2 mm EGTA). The nitrocellulose sheets were then incubated for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2 (or 2 mmEGTA) supplemented with 10 μm125I-labeled CacyBP/SIP (specific radioactivity 0.45 mCi/mmol). Subsequently, the blots were washed three times for 20 min in the incubation buffer, but without CacyBP/SIP, dried, and exposed to AmershamHyperfilmTM MP for 72 h. Affinity resin was made by coupling CacyBP/SIP or CacyBP/SIP-(155–229) to CNBr-Sepharose. Then it was placed into microcentrifuge filter tubes (0.45 μm, Sigma) and equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Purified Ca2+-binding proteins (5 μg) were dissolved in the equilibration buffer and incubated with affinity resin for 15 min at room temperature. The unbound fraction was removed by centrifugation, and the resin was washed five times with the aforementioned buffer. Bound proteins were then eluted from the affinity resin with a buffer containing 2 mm EGTA. The unbound fraction, the final (fifth) wash, and the fraction eluted with EGTA were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. CacyBP/SIP was labeled with a fluorescent probe, acrylodan (Molecular Probes), using the following procedure. 400 nmol of acrylodan were added to 20 nmol of CacyBP/SIP in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The reaction was performed for 2 h at room temperature, and the excess of acrylodan was removed on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction mixture and the labeled protein were protected from light. Fluorescence emission spectra of CacyBP/SIP labeled with acrylodan were recorded on a Fluorolog 3 instrument (Jobin Yvon/SPEX). 1 μm solution of acrylodan-labeled CacyBP/SIP in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA was excited at 395 nm, and the emission spectra were collected from 420 to 570 nm. Buffer emission was then subtracted. Next, S100 proteins were added in a 3-fold molar excess, and the spectra were recorded again. Fluorescence of S100 proteins was subtracted, and the spectra were corrected for dilution. Electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS was performed using the method of Laemmli. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, or the proteins were transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose sheet and detected using specific antibodies. Recombinant CacyBP/SIP or CacyBP/SIP-(155–229) were coupled with CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) using the procedure outlined by the manufacturer. To search for CacyBP/SIP ligand in the brain we performed affinity chromatography with CacyBP/SIP coupled to CNBr-Sepharose. Supernatant after centrifugation of the brain protein extract was applied onto CacyBP/SIP affinity resin in the presence of CaCl2. The EGTA-eluted fraction contained a major protein band with a molecular mass of 10 kDa as seen on SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). Three samples from this fraction containing the same amount of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto the nitrocellulose sheets, and developed with antibodies against S100A1, S100A6, or S100B. As shown in Fig. 1, antibodies against S100B recognized the 10 kDa protein, indicating that S100B from brain extract binds to CacyBP/SIP. We next checked what members of the S100 family were able to bind to CacyBP/SIP in vitro using the nitrocellulose overlay technique combined 125I-labeled CacyBP/SIP protein. Fig. 2 (upper part) shows that the same amount of each Ca2+-binding protein analyzed was applied on the polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto the nitrocellulose sheets, and subsequently used in the overlay experiment. As shown in Fig. 2 (lower part), 125I-CacyBP/SIP binds S100A1, S100A6, S100B, S100P, and S100A12 in the presence of CaCl2. No binding was detected in the case of calbindin D9k, S100A4, parvalbumin, and calmodulin. A barely detectable signal was seen in the case of S100A9. None of the S100 proteins bound to 125I-CacyBP/SIP in the presence of EGTA (not shown). Similar results were obtained from affinity chromatography assays. As shown in Fig. 3 A, S100A1, S100A6, S100A12, S100B and S100P bound to the resin in the presence of CaCl2 and were eluted in the EGTA-containing buffer (lanes labeled as E). This indicates that binding to CacyBP/SIP occurs in a Ca2+-dependent fashion. S100A4, S100A8, calbindin D9k, parvalbumin, and calmodulin did not bind to the CacyBP/SIP affinity resin and were present only in the unbound fractions (lanes labeled asU). Fig. 3 B shows the results of similar experiments in which CacyBP/SIP-(155–229) was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose. All S100 proteins that bound to the full-length CacyBP/SIP also bound to its C-terminal fragment (residues 155–229) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The interactions of CacyBP/SIP with S100B or S100A1 were also analyzed in solution by fluorescence spectroscopy. The emission spectra of CacyBP/SIP labeled with acrylodan were recorded first (Fig.4, solid lines). Next, the spectra were recorded after the addition of S100 protein either in the presence of CaCl2 (dashed lines) or in the presence of EGTA (dotted lines). As shown in Fig. 4, there is a significant increase in the fluorescence intensity for acrylodan-labeled CacyBP/SIP after the addition of S100A1 (Fig.4 A) or S100B (Fig. 4 B) in the presence of CaCl2, but not in the presence of EGTA. When the acrylodan-labeled CacyBP/SIP was added to calbindin D9k in the presence of CaCl2 its fluorescence intensity did not change significantly (Fig. 4 C). To establish the physiological relevance of the interaction between S100 proteins and CacyBP/SIP, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed. Purified S100 proteins and histidine-tagged CacyBP/SIP were used first. As shown in Fig. 5 A, antibodies against histidine tag pulled down CacyBP/SIP together with S100A1, S100A6, or S100B in the presence of CaCl2, but not in the presence of EGTA. As was expected, calbindin D9k did not co-immunoprecipitate with CacyBP/SIP (data not shown). To examine whether S100 proteins interact with CacyBP/SIP in the cell or tissue extracts, co-immunoprecipitations using S100B or S100A6 antibodies were performed. We found that in the presence of CaCl2, CacyBP/SIP co-immunoprecipitated with S100B from brain extract and with S100A6 from EAT cell extract (Fig.5 B). Under both CaCl2 and EGTA conditions, antibodies against S100B immunoprecipitated antigen present in brain extract. However, because antibodies against S100A6 recognize only the Ca2+-bound form of S100A6, they did not immunoprecipitate S100A6 from the extract prepared in the presence of EGTA (Fig.5 B). These data show that in situ, CacyBP/SIP might form a complex with S100 proteins present in a given cell type. S100A6 and CacyBP/SIP were both identified in EAT cells where they are present at a high level (16Kuznicki J. Filipek A Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 663-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Filipek A. Wojda U. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, in other cells or tissues the amount of each protein is significantly different. For instance, we showed that in the brain S100A6 is expressed at a very low level (25Kuznicki J. Filipek A. Heimann P. Kaczmarek L. Kaminska B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 254: 141-144Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Filipek A. Puzianowska M. Cieslak B. Kuznicki J. NeuroReport. 1993; 4: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but CacyBP/SIP is expressed at a very high level (20Filipek A. Kuznicki J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,23Jastrzebska B. Filipek A. Nowicka D. Kaczmarek L. Kuźnicki J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present work we looked for other S100-like protein ligands of CacyBP/SIP in the brain. We prepared CacyBP/SIP affinity resin and performed a chromatography assay with brain protein extract. We found that protein(s) bound to CacyBP/SIP affinity resin have a molecular mass of approximately 10 kDa and that this 10-kDa protein band seen on an SDS gel represents the S100B protein. Using a nitrocellulose overlay assay with 125I-CacyBP/SIP and CacyBP/SIP affinity chromatography we found that S100A1, S100A6, S100A12, and S100P bind to CacyBP/SIP in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This binding seems to be specific, because some S100 proteins such as S100A4 and calbindin D9k did not bind at all. Other EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins such as calmodulin and parvalbumin did not exhibit any affinity for CacyBP/SIP. The binding of purified CacyBP/SIP with S100A1 or S100B was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy and by co-immunoprecipitation of purified proteins. We also showed that CacyBP/SIP was co-immunoprecipitated with S100B from the brain extract in the presence of Ca2+. A very low expression of S100A1 and S100A6 in the brain is probably the reason why only S100B was co-immunoprecipitated with CacyBP/SIP from the brain extract and why only S100B was detected in the fraction eluted in the EGTA-containing buffer from CacyBP/SIP affinity resin (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, we hypothesize that in the brain interaction between CacyBP/SIP and S100B, S100A1, or S100A6 are of physiological significance. Since CacyBP/SIP is present in various tissues and S100 proteins exhibit cell- and tissue-specific expression, CacyBP/SIP might form a physiologically relevant complex with different S100 proteins present in abundance in different cell types. In the present work we established that the interaction between CacyBP/SIP and S100 proteins occurs via the C-terminal fragment of CacyBP/SIP (residues 155–229), which was previously shown to contain the S100A6 binding domain (21Nowotny M. Bhattacharya S. Filipek A. Krezel A.M. Chazin W. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31178-311822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). S100 binding domains in other targets of S100 proteins have also been identified, for instance in annexin I and II that bind S100A11 and S100A10, respectively (27Sudo T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6351-6357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Sudo T. Hidaka H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These domains involve about 15 residues at the N terminus of the annexins and form an amphiphilic α-helix similar to those found in calmodulin-binding proteins (29Cox J.A. Comte M. Fitton J.E. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2527-2534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our theoretical PSIpred analysis, performed according to Altschul et al. (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar), suggests that the C-terminal fragment of CacyBP/SIP (residues 189–201) can also form an amphiphilic α-helix. While the amphiphilic α-helices in annexins are specific, since each helix binds only one type of S100 protein (31Rety S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo-Marie F. Lewit-Bentley A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), the C-terminal fragment of CacyBP/SIP binds several S100 proteins (present work). To reveal the mechanism underlying the difference in specificity of CacyBP/SIP and annexins toward S100 proteins, structural studies of CacyBP/SIP-S100 complexes should be performed and the data compared with that obtained for annexin-S100 protein complexes (31Rety S.

Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) reported that SIP, a component of a novel ubiquitinylation pathway leading to β-catenin degradation, binds Siah-1 via an N-terminal region (residues 1–80) and Skp1 via a C-terminal region (residues 78–228) (Fig.6). Our results presented in this work show that CacyBP/SIP-(155–229) binds S100 proteins. Since both Skp1 and S100 binding sites are located in the C-terminal part of CacyBP/SIP, we hypothesize that Skp1 binds to the same region to which S100 proteins bind and therefore that these two proteins compete for CacyBP/SIP. However, we have obtained preliminary results showing that the Skp1 binding region does not overlap with the S100 binding region. Thus, we suggest that the Skp1 binding region is located between the Siah-1 binding domain (residues 1–80) and the C-terminal domain of CacyBP/SIP (residues 155–229) that binds S100 proteins, presumably spanning residues 78–155 (Fig. 6). What the physiological effect of S100 proteins on the Siah-1-CacyBP/SIP-Skp1 ubiquitinylation complex might be remains to be established. It has been shown that this complex, besides SCF, is involved in β-catenin degradation (1Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The degradation of β-catenin in some tumors is deficient (33Barker N. Clevers H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and the expression of S100 proteins in tumor cells is up-regulated and in some cases correlates with metastatic activity (34Weterman M.A. Stoopen G.M. van Muijen G.N. Kuznicki J. Ruiter D.J. Bloemers H.P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1291-1296PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lloyd B.H. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P.S. Barraclough R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). If S100 proteins affect the Siah-1-CacyBP/SIP-Skp1 ubiquitinylation complex regulating β-catenin degradation, one may speculate that Ca2+-binding proteins of the S100 family link Ca2+-homeostasis with ubiquitinylation and degradation processes. Further studies concerning the degradation of β-catenin via the ubiquitinylation complex involving Siah-1-CacyBP/SIP-Skp1 and S100 proteins might help in understanding the mechanism of tumorigenesis.

The mechanism of this effect has been attributed to its allosteric modulatory actions on glutamate- and γ-aminobutyric acid-gated ion channels.

We found that PREGS induces a robust potentiation of the frequency but not the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) mediated by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons. PREGS also decreased paired pulse facilitation of autaptic EPSCs evoked by depolarization, indicating that it modulates glutamate release probability presynaptically. PREGS potentiation of mEPSCs was mimicked by dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and (+)-pentazocine but not by (−)-pentazocine, the synthetic (−)-enantiomer of PREGS or the inactive steroid isopregnanolone.

These results suggest that PREGS increases spontaneous glutamate release via activation of a presynaptic Gi/o-coupled ς receptor and an elevation in intracellular Ca2+ levels.

Psychoneuroendocrinology. 1998; 23: 963-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) made the important discovery that certain steroids are synthesized in the central and peripheral nervous systems. These compounds, known as neurosteroids, are produced locally in glial and neuronal cells and can exert important modulatory actions in the nervous system. A particularly abundant neurosteroid in the central nervous system is pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS)1 (1Baulieu E.E. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 1998; 23: 963-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 2Liere P. Akwa Y. Weill-Engerer S. Eychenne B. Pianos A. Robel P. Sjovall J. Schumacher M. Baulieu E.E. J.

Although the neurophysiological role of endogenous PREGS has yet to be conclusively established, experiments involving exogenous administration of this compound suggest that it has a promnesic effect (3Flood J.F.

For example, post-training injection of PREGS into the hippocampus and amygdala of mice improves retention for foot shock active avoidance training (4Flood J.F. Morley J.E. Roberts E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10806-10810Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition, low levels of PREGS in the hippocampus were found to be correlated with a deficiency in cognitive performance in aged rats, which could be ameliorated by intrahippocampal injections of this neurosteroid (5Vallee M. Mayo W. Darnaudery M. Corpechot C. Young J. Koehl M. Le Moal M. Baulieu E.E. Robel P. Simon H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14865-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that PREGS attenuates amyloid peptide-induced amnesia in mice (8Maurice T. Su T.P. Privat A. Neuroscience. 1998; 83: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, PREGS or its analogs could potentially be used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Although the mechanisms by which PREGS produces cognitive effects are not fully understood, numerous studies suggest that this agent modulates several neuronal ion channels (9Rupprecht R. Holsboer F. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). For instance, PREGS has been shown to inhibit γ-aminobutyric acid-type A (GABAA) receptors (10Lambert J.J. Belelli D. Hill-Venning C. Callachan H. Peters J.A. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 1996; 16: 155-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), to potentiateN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (11Irwin R.P. Maragakis N.J. Rogawski M.A. Purdy R.H. Farb D.H. Paul S.M.

Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 813-819PubMed Google Scholar), and to inhibit voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (15ffrench-Mullen J.M. Danks P. Spence K.T. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1963-1977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to ion channels, PREGS has also been shown to target metabotropic receptors, such as ς receptors. These receptors were initially thought to belong to the opioid family of receptors, but they are now categorized separately (16Maurice T. Phan V.L. Urani A. Kamei H. Noda Y. Nabeshima T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 81: 125-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Two classes of pharmacologically defined ς receptors are widely accepted and are denoted as the ς1 and ς2 subtypes (16Maurice T. Phan V.L. Urani A. Kamei H. Noda Y. Nabeshima T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 81: 125-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). ς1receptors bind (+)-benzomorphans and haloperidol with high affinity. In contrast, ς2 receptors bind haloperidol and (+)-benzomorphans with low affinity, and they also bind benzomorphans without enantioselectivity. ς ligand binding sites can be detected both intracellularly on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and extracellularly on the plasma membrane (17McCann D.J. Su T.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 188: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A ς ligand-binding protein has recently been cloned from a number of tissues, including brain (18Moebius F.F. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 67-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This binding protein exhibits the pharmacological profile of ς1 receptors and is expressed in the ER (19Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Fei Y.J. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although its sequence has no known homology to other mammalian proteins, it shows similarity to the yeast sterol C8-C7 isomerase involved in ergosterol biosynthesis (24Moebius F.F. Bermoser K. Reiter R.J. Hanner M. Glossmann H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16871-16878Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane ς receptors can be activated by PREGS and other neurosteroids but, in contrast to ς ligand binding proteins expressed in the ER, appear to be directly coupled to pertussis-sensitive G proteins (25Ueda H. Yoshida A. Tokuyama S. Mizuno K. Maruo J. Matsuno K. Mita S. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 41: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Tokuyama S. Hirata K. Ide A. Ueda H. Neurosci.

A. 1995; 92: 3774-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Both the cDNA sequence and physiological role of these G protein-coupled metabotropic ς receptors have yet to be fully characterized. In this paper, we report a novel effect of PREGS on glutamate release that depends on activation of plasma membrane ς receptors. Specifically, we measured the effects of this neurosteroid on miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) mediated by the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Miniature synaptic currents are the most elementary forms of synaptic transmission, representing the postsynaptic responses to action potential-independent spontaneous release of single presynaptic vesicles. It is well established that when a modulator affects presynaptic neurotransmitter release, it produces a change in the frequency but not in the amplitude of miniature synaptic events (for instance, see Ref. 29Li Y.X. Zhang Y. Lester H.A. Schuman E.M. Davidson N. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10231-10240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that PREGS selectively induces a robust increase in the frequency of mEPSCs, indicating that it enhances the probability of glutamate release from presynaptic terminals. Moreover, we show that this effect depends on an elevation in intracellular Ca2+ levels triggered by activation of presynaptic Gi/o protein-coupled ς1-like receptors. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center and conform to National Institutes of Health guidelines. Neuronal cultures were prepared in all cases from postnatal day 3–4 Sprague-Dawley rats. These experiments utilized either mixed hippocampal cell cultures (prepared as described previously (30Costa E.T. Olivera D.S. Meyer D.A. Ferreira V.M. Soto E.E. Frausto S. Savage D.D. Browning M.D. Valenzuela C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38268-38274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)) or autaptic neuronal cultures grown on glial cells attached to collagen-on-agarose microislands (prepared as described elsewhere (31Segal M.M. Furshpan E.J. J. Neurophysiol. 1990; 64: 1390-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)). Neurons grown on microislands were used for the studies of paired pulse facilitation (PPF). Neurons were used for electrophysiological experiments 8–14 days after culture. Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed using instrumentation and software previously described (30Costa E.T. Olivera D.S. Meyer D.A. Ferreira V.M. Soto E.E. Frausto S. Savage D.D. Browning M.D. Valenzuela C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38268-38274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), with the exception that mEPSCs were first recorded on digital audiotape and then digitized by using a Digidata 1200 interface and pClamp 7 software (Axon Laboratories, Foster City, CA). Miniature EPSCs were analyzed using the Mini Analysis Program from Synaptosoft (Decatur, GA). We recorded from pyramidal-like neurons that had large somas and well defined dendritic processes. Neurons were clamped at −70 mV for most experiments and, when indicated, at −90 mV. The external solution contained 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 11 mm glucose, and 0.02 mm bicuculine methiodide (pH 7.4, ∼320 mosmol). For mEPSC recordings, this solution also contained 600 nmtetrodotoxin. For some recordings of autaptic currents, the concentration of Mg2+ was increased to 2 mm to favor PPF (32Mennerick S. Zorumski C.F. J. Physiol. 1995; 488: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For recordings of mEPSCs, the internal solution contained 5 mm CsCl, 140 mmCsCH3SO3, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, ∼300 mosmol. To record autaptic currents, the composition of the internal solution was 4 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, 140 mm potassium gluconate, pH 7.25, ∼280 mosmol. Patch pipette electrodes had resistances ranging from 3 to 7 megaohms. Autaptic EPSCs were generated by a 1.5- or 2-ms depolarizing pulse (from −70 mV to +20 mV); for studies of PPF, two pulses separated by 50 or 60 ms were delivered at a frequency of 0.05 Hz. Compounds were dissolved in Me2SO before dilution into external solution, and equal volumes of Me2SO were added to control external solutions. Me2SO concentrations never exceeded 0.05%. Tetrodotoxin and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione were from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA); 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (acetoxymethyl) ester (BAPTA-AM) and pertussis toxin were fromCalbiochem; PREGS was from Steraloids (Newport, RI); BD-1063 anddl-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate were from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Synthesis of the (−)-enantiomer of PREGS (ent-PREGS) has been described elsewhere (33Nilsson K.R. Zorumski C.F. Covey D.F. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 2604-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). (+)-Pentazocine succinate was generously provided by Kevin Gormley (National Institute on Drug Abuse). All other chemicals were from Sigma or Fluka (St. Louis, MO). The effects of all compounds were quantified with respect to the average of control and washout responses. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used initially to test for significant differences between treatments in individual cells and to determine whether data followed a Gaussian distribution. Statistical comparisons of pooled data were performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test or by Student's t test. In all cases, a p< 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed with the Mini Analysis program or Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. in all cases. We first measured the effect of PREGS on mEPSCs to determine whether it modulated spontaneous glutamate release. To isolate AMPAR-mediated events, we recorded mEPSCs at −70 mV in 1 mm Mg2+-containing external solution. Under these conditions, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (20 μm) reduced the frequency of events by 96 ± 3% (n = 7) with respect to control (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 1, PREGS caused a robust, concentration-dependent, increase in mEPSC frequency. The effect of PREGS was significant at concentrations of ≥10 μm (Fig. 1 D). The onset of this effect occurred within ∼1 min after bath application of the neurosteroid and was fully reversible within ∼2–4 min after washout. The increase in mEPSC frequency was observed at both −70 and −90 mV. At these membrane potentials, PREGS (50 μm) increased mEPSC frequency by 494 ± 184% (n = 6) and 488 ± 192% (n = 7), respectively (data not shown). This finding indicates that the effect of PREGS is not due simply to an increase in the detection of subthreshold mEPSCs. The effect of PREGS was also not due to NMDAR activation, because recording in Mg2+-free external solution containing the NMDAR antagonistdl-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (50 μm) had no effect on the action of this neurosteroid. PREGS (50 μm) increased mEPSC frequency by 448 ± 151% (n = 4) or 485 ± 182% (n = 9) with respect to control in the presence of dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate or Mg2+-containing external solution, respectively (data not shown). We did not detect any effect of PREGS on mEPSC amplitude at any of the concentrations examined; mEPSC amplitudes were changed by 1.6 ± 2.8, 0.55 ± 3.6, −1.6 ± 4.4, and −1.1 ± 3.5% with respect to control in the presence of 1, 10, 20, and 50 μm PREGS, respectively (see Fig. 1 C for an illustration of a lack of an effect of 20 μm PREGS). To eliminate the possibility of a nonspecific action and to determine the enantioselectivity of the PREGS effect, we tested the effect of the inactive neurosteroid, isopregnanolone, and the (−)-enantiomer of PREGS, ent-PREGS, respectively. As shown (Fig.1 D), these steroids did not induce a change in the frequency of mEPSCs. Since ent-PREGS has been shown to exert more potent inverted U-shaped effects than PREGS under some experimental conditions (6Akwa Y. Ladurelle N. Covey D.F. Baulieu E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14033-14037Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we also tested its effect at a 1 μmconcentration and found that it does not affect mEPSC frequency (2.5 ± 0.9% change with respect to control; n = 3). To confirm that PREGS increases the probability of glutamate release, we measured its effect on PPF of autaptic AMPAR-mediated EPSCs evoked by depolarizing pulses (Fig. 2). It is well established that manipulations that enhance the basal probability of release increase the impact of the first action potential (i.e. deplete synaptic vesicles), resulting in a reduction in PPF (For an example, see Ref. 34Sullivan J.M. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 1286-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that treatment with PREGS (50 μm) increases the amplitude of the first EPSC by 43 ± 11% (n = 9;p < 0.01 by one-sample t testversus a theoretical mean of zero; Fig. 2 A) and also reduces PPF (Fig. 2 B), confirming that PREGS increases the probability of presynaptic glutamate release. PREGS has been shown to inhibit NMDA receptor-dependent [3H]norepinephrine release in hippocampal slices by a mechanism that involves ς1 receptors (28Monnet F.P. Mahe V. Robel P. Baulieu E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3774-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the role of these receptors in the effects of PREGS on glutamate release. As shown in Fig. 3, the ς1 receptor antagonists, haloperidol and BD-1063 (preincubation for 30–45 min at 37 °C), blocked the PREGS-induced increase in mEPSC frequency. Moreover, pretreatment with haloperidol or BD1063 did not affect the average basal frequency of mEPSCs (Fig. 3,B1 and C1). This finding indicates that the decrease in PREGS efficacy in the presence of these two compounds is not due to an overall decline in the spontaneous release probability. We next determined whether the effect of PREGS could be mimicked by other ς receptor agonists. We tested the effect of DHEAS, another neurosteroid that activates ς1-like receptors in the brain (25Ueda H. Yoshida A. Tokuyama S. Mizuno K. Maruo J. Matsuno K. Mita S. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 41: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and of (+)-pentazocine, the prototypical ς1receptor agonist. As shown in Fig. 4, these compounds produced a similar increase in mEPSC frequency to that produced by PREGS (Fig. 1 D). Conversely, (−)-pentazocine did not increase mEPSC frequency (Fig. 4 C). None of these compounds significantly affected mEPSC amplitude (data not shown).Figure 4ς1 receptor agonists DHEAS and (+)-pentazocine (PTZ) mimic the PREGS-dependent enhancement of mEPSC frequency.

A. 1995; 92: 3774-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the effect of pertussis toxin treatment on the PREGS-induced increase in mEPSC frequency. As illustrated in Fig. 5, incubation of neurons for 36–48 h at 37 °C with 50 ng/ml pertussis toxin significantly reduced the effect of PREGS on mEPSC frequency. This result indicates that the effect of PREGS requires activation of the Gi/o subtype of G proteins. As also shown, pretreatment with pertussis toxin did not affect basal frequency of mEPSCs (Fig.5 B). This suggests that the decrease in PREGS efficacy in the presence of pertussis toxin is not due to an overall decline in the spontaneous release probability and is most likely due to a direct effect of pertussis toxin on the PREGS-mediated second messenger cascades that results in increased spontaneous glutamate release. ς receptors have been shown to regulate intracellular calcium (16Maurice T. Phan V.L. Urani A. Kamei H. Noda Y. Nabeshima T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 81: 125-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar,35Hayashi T. Maurice T. Su T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 788-798PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, we examined its role in the mechanism of action of PREGS. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig.6. As a control, neurons were first exposed to 50 μm PREGS, which produced the expected increase in mEPSC frequency. After washout, the same neurons were incubated for 15–20 min with the membrane-permeable Ca2+chelator, BAPTA-AM (10 or 20 μm). A subsequent exposure to 50 μm PREGS failed to induce an elevation in mEPSC frequency (Fig. 6, A and B). This result indicates that an elevation in intracellular Ca2+ levels is required for the presynaptic actions of PREGS. To eliminate the possibility that the effect of BAPTA-AM was an artifact due to run down of the effect of PREGS, we applied PREGS twice under control conditions (Fig. 6 C). As shown, the effect of a second application of PREGS closely reproduced that of the first application (same result seen in three additional neurons). In this paper, we report that PREGS induces a robust increase in the frequency but not the amplitude of AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs in hippocampal neurons cultured from neonatal rats. Moreover, we found that PREGS reduces PPF of AMPAR-mediated synaptic responses, indicating that this neurosteroid increases the probability of glutamate release at the presynaptic level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a modulatory effect of PREGS on the basal probability of glutamate release in central nervous system neurons. It is noteworthy, however, that we previously found that PREGS exerts presynaptic modulatory actions on glutamatergic terminals in the rat hippocampus. Specifically, we demonstrated that PREGS enhances PPF of NMDAR- and AMPAR-mediated EPSPs in CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices from adult rats (36Partridge L.D. Valenzuela C.F. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 301: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Importantly, we did not find evidence indicating that PREGS affects the basal probability of glutamate release in these slices (36Partridge L.D. Valenzuela C.F. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 301: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, PREGS appears to exert distinct effects on glutamate release depending on either the neuronal developmental stage or the type of neuronal preparation being used (i.e. it increases the probability of spontaneous glutamate release in hippocampal neurons cultured from neonatal rats and increases facilitation of evoked glutamate release in CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices from adult rats). Our finding that PREGS affects glutamate release contributes to the growing evidence that this neurosteroid has important regulatory actions on the release of a number of neurotransmitters. In agreement with the results of our study, in vivo microdialysis experiments have demonstrated that PREGS increases basal acetylcholine release in the hippocampus and cortex of rats (37Rhodes M.E. Li P.K. Flood J.F. Johnson D.A. Brain Res. 1996; 733: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 38Darnaudery M. Koehl M. Pallares M. Le Moal M. Mayo W. J.

Brain Res. 2000; 852: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and that it also increases basal dopamine release in the rat nucleus accumbens (40Barrot M. Vallee M. Gingras M.A. Le Moal M. Mayo W. Piazza P.V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3757-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Not all studies, however, have shown a potentiating effect of PREGS on basal neurotransmitter release. Teschemacher et al. (41Teschemacher A. Kasparov S. Kravitz E.A. Rahamimoff R. Brain Res. 1997; 772: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) found that PREGS (1–50 μm) reduces the probability of GABA release in cultured hippocampal neurons. Taken together with our finding that PREGS increases glutamate release in the same type of neurons, the results of Teschemacher et al. (41Teschemacher A. Kasparov S. Kravitz E.A. Rahamimoff R. Brain Res. 1997; 772: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) indicate that this neurosteroid differentially regulates basal neurotransmitter release from GABAergic versus glutamatergic axonal terminals. It should also be emphasized that another study found that PREGS (10 nm to 3 μm) does not affect basal [3H]norepinephrine release in hippocampal slices from adult rats (28Monnet F.P. Mahe V. Robel P. Baulieu E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3774-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of PREGS appear to depend on the neurotransmitter specificity of a particular presynaptic terminal. Monnet et al. (28Monnet F.P. Mahe V. Robel P. Baulieu E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3774-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) determined that PREGS decreases NMDA-evoked overflow of [3H]norepinephrine in hippocampal slices of adult rats and that ς receptor antagonists block this effect. This finding prompted us to evaluate the role of ς receptors in the mechanism of the PREGS-induced increase in spontaneous quantal glutamate release. We found that the ς receptor antagonists, haloperidol and BD-1063, block the effect of PREGS on the probability of glutamate release. In addition, the effect of PREGS was mimicked by DHEAS, another neurosteroid that binds to ς receptors. Importantly, (+)-pentazocine, the prototypical ς1receptor agonist, also mimicked the effects of PREGS, albeit at higher concentrations (5–50 μm) than expected; lower concentrations of (+)-pentazocine (0.1–10 μm) have been shown to activate metabotropic ς1"

However, the ability of calcium to modulate the differentiation of striated muscle cells is poorly understood. To examine this issue we studied C2C12 cells, which is a myoblast cell line that differentiates in vitro. First, we observed that the L-type calcium channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil effectively inhibited electrically induced calcium transients. Next, C2C12 cells were exposed to these agents during conditions that induce myocyte differentiation. In the presence of nifedipine and verapamil, myoblasts failed to form myotubes. Dantrolene and thapsigargin, which decrease intracellular calcium by different mechanisms, also inhibited differentiation. In addition, nifedipine and verapamil inhibited the expression of myosin heavy chain and myogenin, two markers of skeletal myoblast differentiation. In contrast, levels of the transcriptional factor Myf5, which is expressed in undifferentiated myoblasts, did not decline. Calcium channel blockade also prevented the expression of a reporter driven by the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter.

These events lead to the activation of muscle-specific genes and the repression of genes required for cell proliferation, both of which are necessary for differentiation (1Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N.

This genetic program requires the action of a number of transcriptional factors and nuclear proteins (1Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Dev. 2001; 11: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the signaling molecules that link extracellular signals to changes in transcriptional factor activity and subsequent gene expression is beginning to evolve. Calcium is an intracellular messenger that is important in muscle cells for excitation-contraction coupling (reviewed in Refs. 3Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 5Balke C.W. Shorofsky S.R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 290-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, action potentials open voltage gated, L-type calcium channels to allow small quantities of calcium to enter the cell (so called “sparks”). This triggers calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (so called “calcium transients”). This larger wave of intracellular calcium leads to direct activation of the contractile apparatus, myosin cross-bridge cycling, and muscle contraction. Second, through the action of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II)1 and other kinases and phosphatases, calcium can indirectly alter the activity of proteins involved in contraction, calcium release, and calcium reuptake (3Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating cellular contraction, calcium acts as an intracellular messenger to modulate many aspects of cell physiology. Calcium-signaling pathways modulate the expression of muscle-specific genes during differentiation by altering the phosphorylation and activity of a number of transcriptional factors (reviewed in Ref. 3Frey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar,4McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). More specifically, calcium regulates the function of phosphatases and kinases (e.g. calcineurin, CaMK and protein kinase C) that can alter the localization and function of transcriptional activating factors such as cAMP response element-binding protein, MEF2, Myf5, MyoD, myogenin, nuclear factor of activated T-cells, and serum response factor (3Frey N.

Based on these observations, it is possible that intracellular calcium may play a role in the differentiation of striated myocytes by altering gene expression. To examine this issue, we studied the effects of decreased intracellular calcium levels in C2C12 cells, which are a favored model of skeletal muscle differentiation (12Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K.

Using three independent indices of myoblast differentiation, we now demonstrate that intracellular calcium levels play a crucial role in muscle cell maturation. Medium and bovine serum were obtained from American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA). All other culture supplements were from Invitrogen. Fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (Fluo-3 AM) and pluronic F-127 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Anti-myosin heavy chain antibody (MF-20) was developed by Donald Fischman and obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa (15Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). C2C12 cells (ATCC no. CRL-1772) were grown on plastic or glass culture substrates as described (14Wei L. Zhou W.

Briefly, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 μm pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate until 90–100% confluence. Cells were induced to differentiate using a low serum differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pyruvate, penicillin, streptomycin, and 2% horse serum). Upon induction of differentiation, medium containing vehicle or drugs was changed daily. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were harvested after 4 days in differentiation medium. Cells were labeled for 15 min with Fluo-3 AM diluted in differentiation medium to a final concentration of 5 μm from a stock solution of 885 μm Fluo-3 AM and 20 μm pluronic F-127 (per manufacturer's instructions). Cells grown on cover slips were incubated in 1 ml of a solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(2-ethanesulphonic acid), pH 7.3) (16Lorenzon P. Grohovaz F. Ruzzier F. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) for an additional 15 min at room temperature. To induce acute calcium release (calcium transients), samples were stimulated using a Grass SD5 stimulator (Quincy, MA). Platinum electrodes were placed 1.7 cm apart, and current flowed roughly parallel to the long axis of the myotube. Initial voltage response curves demonstrated that calcium transients occurred with a stimulation threshold of 15–30 V and a plateau of 50 V. Therefore, all further stimulations were performed at 30–40 V for 100 ms. Samples were stimulated, and images were recorded three times for each condition with 30 s between each stimulation. Specimens were first stimulated before the addition of any drug (0 μm). Specimens were next treated with increasing concentrations of drug by adding successive 1-μl aliquots of 1000× concentrated drug. After a 2-min incubation at each drug concentration, electrically stimulated calcium transients were recorded. Individual experiments lasted less than 1 h after the addition of Fluo-3 AM. Images of calcium signal were obtained using an Olympus Fluoview confocal laser scanning microscope (IX70, Melville, NY), an UPlanFl 20× objective (numerical aperture 0.5) and Fluoview image processing software (v2.1). The same area of the cell was analyzed during each stimulation. Images were scanned at a frame rate of 0.3 s per frame and 30 frames were obtained to record a total of 9 s per stimulation. Image intensity within an outlined area was scanned in Fluoview and saved to a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel 2000, Microsoft, Inc., Redmond, WA). The three curves for each condition were averaged and normalized to the three measurements prior to stimulation. Baseline and peak values for each treatment were combined and analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (v3.0, GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA). Concentration-response curves were performed at least five times for each condition. Images of Fluo-3 fluorescenceversus time were saved as single .tiff files. Movies were created by copying sequential images as layers into ImageReady (v3.0, Adobe, San Jose, CA). For easier viewing, movies were saved as QuickTime files at 0.1 s per frame. After 4 days in differentiation medium, nuclear and myosin heavy chain labeling were performed as described (17Porter G.A. Dmytrenko G.M. Winkelmann J.C. Bloch R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 18Porter G.A. Scher M.G. Resneck W.G. Porter N.C. Fowler V.M. Bloch R.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 37: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 30 min with 6 μg/ml Hoechst nuclear dye and fixed with 100% methanol for 15 min at −20 °C. After rehydration with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) plus 10 mm sodium azide and blocking with this buffer plus 2% bovine serum albumin, specimens were labeled with 1:20 anti-myosin heavy chain antibody (15Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Finally, samples were washed and labeled with Cy-3 rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Phase contrast and indirect immunofluorescence images were captured using an Olympus IX70 epifluorescence microscope equipped with 4× (UPlanFl, numerical aperture 0.13) and 10× (CPlan, numerical aperture 0.25) objectives. Images were captured with a DEI 750 T Color charge-coupled device camera (Optronics Engineering, Goleta, CA) and analyzed using ImagePro software (v4.1, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Phase images were obtained prior to Hoechst staining. Images were processed for presentation using Adobe PhotoShop (v4.0) and Adobe Illustrator (v9.0). For measurement of the differentiation index, Hoechst-stained nuclei were counted in each image. Images of Hoechst and myosin heavy chain staining were then merged, and nuclei associated with myosin-positive cells were counted. The differentiation index for each image pair is defined as the percent of all nuclei present in MF-20 stained cells. For each separate experiment, three image pairs were taken per condition. RNA was isolated from C2C12 cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) and quantified by spectrophotometry. 1–5 μg of total RNA was blotted to an Ambion BrightStar-Plus nylon membrane and cross-linked (UV Stratalinker 2400, Stratagene). Northern blotting was performed using Ambion NorthernMax reagents at 42 °C per the manufacturer's instructions. Images of labeled blots were obtained using a phosphorimaging system (GS-525 Molecular Imaging System, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Probes for myogenin, Myf5 and 18 S rRNA used in Northern blot experiments were produced by PCR amplification using HotStarTaq (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and cDNA from C2C12 cells. Myogenin primers were as described (19Ogilvie M. Yu X. Nicolas-Metral V. Pulido S.M. Liu C. Ruegg U.T. Noguchi C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39754-39761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Myf5 primers were designed from the published mouse sequence (GenBank accession number NM-008656): 5′-AGCCCACCAGCCCCACCTC-3′ (nucleotides 464–482), 5′-TTCTGCCCAGCTTTTCTTTCCTTC-3′ (nucleotides 835–858). Primers for 18 S rRNA were obtained from Ambion (Quantum 18S Classic Primers, Austin, TX). Probes were radiolabeled using the Prime-It RmT Random Primer Labeling Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and Redivue [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, AmershamBiosciences) per the manufacturer's instructions. Reporter assays using a luciferase expression vector driven by the skeletal α-actin promoter (SK-Luc, provided by Dr. Robert Schwartz) were performed as described (14Wei L. Zhou W. Croissant J.D. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Balasubramanyam A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30287-30294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, C2C12 cells were grown in 12-well plates to 50–75% confluence and were transfected with Sk-Luc (1 μg/well) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). To control for transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with pSV-β-galactosidase (35 ng/well, Promega, Madison, WI). When confluent, samples were then differentiated in the presence of vehicle or drug for 4 days as above. Specimens were processed for luciferase and β-galactosidase expression using the luciferase and β-galactosidase assay systems with reporter lysis buffer (Promega; per manufacturer's instructions). Luciferase measurements were made using a luminometer (Turner Designs, Model TD-20/20, Sunnyvale, CA), and β-galactosidase was measured using a Bio-Rad Model 550 microplate reader. Data are presented as means and standard errors of the mean (S.E.). Except as noted, at least three separate experiments were performed for each condition. All quantifiable data were saved to Microsoft Excel or GraphPad Prism. Statistically significant differences between groups were evaluated using one-way or repeated measures ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc testing using GraphPad Prism (p < 0.05). To begin to examine the role of calcium on myocyte differentiation we first examined the effects of L-type calcium channel blockade on intracellular calcium levels in C2C12 cells. Changes in intracellular calcium concentrations were assessed by confocal microscopy using the calcium-sensitive dye, Fluo-3 AM. Cultures were studied after 4 days in differentiation medium. To define patterns of Fluo-3 response under normal conditions, cells were stimulated at different voltages (5–50 V) to generate voltage-response curves. In all cases the threshold for a response in Fluo-3 signal was 15–30 V. At 50 V, we saw maximal responses in all cells. Thus, in all subsequent studies cells were stimulated at 30–40 V. Next, to determine the effects of drugs on calcium release, samples were examined in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of nifedipine and verapamil, two antagonists of L-type calcium channels. Both agents decreased the peak calcium response to electrical stimulation in a concentration-dependent manner, although nifedipine was more effective at the concentrations used (Figs.1 and 2). Control experiments using vehicle demonstrated that the effects were not due to nonspecific effects of the experimental protocol over time (not shown).Figure 2Nifedipine and verapamil eliminate electrically stimulated calcium transients. C2C12 myotubes labeled with Fluo-3 AM were electrically stimulated, and fluorescence intensity was measured over time. A, representative example of fluorescence intensity of a C2C12 cell stimulated in the presence of increasing concentrations of nifedipine. Prior to any treatment (0 μm), stimulation caused a transient rise in intracellular calcium (♦). Treatment with 0.1 (▪), 1 (▴), 10 (■), and 100 (X) μm nifedipine decreased then abolished these calcium transients. B, peak fluorescence (± S.E.) during electrical stimulation in the presence of different concentrations of nifedipine or verapamil. Treatment with vehicle had no significant effects (not shown), whereas both nifedipine and verapamil caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the amplitude of the calcium transient. Means were compared by repeated measures using ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc testing (*, p < 0.001; **,p < 0.05, significantly different from 0 μm of each agent).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Having demonstrated that nifedipine and verapamil decrease intracellular calcium levels, we next examined the effects of reduced intracellular calcium concentrations on myocyte differentiation. In the presence of differentiation medium, C2C12 cells mature into multinucleated myotubes with a functional contractile apparatus (12Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C. Science. 1985; 230: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 20Kubo Y. J. Physiol. 1991; 442: 743-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, confluent cultures of C2C12 cells were incubated in differentiation medium in the presence of vehicle, nifedipine, or verapamil for 4 days. The morphology of each specimen was first assessed using phase microscopy. Cultures were then stained for nuclei to assess for the presence of multinucleated myotubes and for myosin heavy chain to examine the maturation of the contractile apparatus. Vehicle-treated cultures contained few undifferentiated myoblasts and numerous multinucleated, myosin heavy chain-positive myotubes (Fig.3, A and F). In contrast, treatment with either nifedipine or verapamil inhibited the ability of these cultures to differentiate (Fig. 3, B–E,G–J). Calcium channel blockade decreased both the number and the size of differentiated myotubes. These effects were concentration-dependent, and the effective concentrations correlated with those required to attenuate electrically stimulated calcium transients (Figs. 1 and 2). When the effects of nifedipine and verapamil on differentiation were quantified using a differentiation index, these visual impressions were confirmed. Control experiments demonstrated the emergence of multinucleated myotubes during incubation in differentiation medium with 67% of the nuclei present in differentiated cells after 4 days (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, both nifedipine and verapamil significantly decreased the ability of C2C12 cells to differentiate (Fig. 4 B). This effect was concentration-dependent, with 100 μmnifedipine and 100 μm verapamil reducing the differentiation index to 25.1% and 7.6% of control values, respectively. To further demonstrate that these effects on differentiation are due to decreased calcium levels, we next treated C2C12 cells with agents known to decrease intracellular calcium by mechanisms other than calcium channel blockade. Differentiating C2C12 cells were treated with dantrolene, which inhibits calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, or thapsigargin, which inhibits calcium reuptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and eventually depletes total cellular calcium (21Vali S. Carlsen R. Pessah I. Gorin F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 184-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The doses used are known to effectively decrease intracellular calcium levels and to alter gene expression in skeletal myotubes (21Vali S. Carlsen R. Pessah I. Gorin F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 184-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Treatment with either agent led to a qualitative and quantitative inhibition of myocyte differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner (Figs. 3 and 4). After observing that nifedipine and verapamil inhibited cellular differentiation, we next examined the effects of these agents on the expression of two muscle-specific transcriptional activating factors, myogenin and Myf5. During myoblast differentiation the expression of myogenin is increased, while that of Myf5 is decreased (1Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 22Shimokawa T. Kato M. Ezaki O. Hashimoto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To address this issue, Northern blotting experiments were performed using RNA from C2C12 cells treated with nifedipine or verapamil during differentiation. Myogenin and Myf5 levels were quantified using a phosphorimaging device. As expected, we observed that myogenin gene expression increased during differentiation (not shown) (1Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 22Shimokawa T. Kato M. Ezaki O. Hashimoto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, nifedipine and verapamil inhibited the expression of myogenin in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.5, A and B). Myf5 expression decreased dramatically during differentiation (not shown) as expected (1Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 22Shimokawa T. Kato M. Ezaki O. Hashimoto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, cultures treated with nifedipine or verapamil maintained high levels of Myf5 expression, although the levels of Myf5 expression in cell treated with verapamil were not statistically significant from control (Fig. 5, Aand C). As with myogenin, the effects of these agents on Myf5 expression were concentration-dependent (Fig.5 C). The previous experiments showed that calcium channel blockade inhibits morphologic changes and alters transcriptional factor expression during myoblast differentiation. Next, to assess if decreased intracellular calcium levels alter the expression of structural genes that are normally up-regulated during myocyte differentiation, the effects of nifedipine and verapamil on α-actin gene expression were examined. Cultures of C2C12 cells were transfected with SK-Luc, a luciferase expression vector driven by the skeletal α-actin promoter that has been validated in previous studies of C2C12 cell and primary myocyte differentiation (14Wei L.

Non-confluent C2C12 cultures were transfected with SK-Luc and were allowed to differentiate in medium containing vehicle, nifedipine, or verapamil. After 4 days in differentiation medium, specimens were assayed for luciferase expression. As expected from previous experiments, specimens treated with vehicle expressed high amounts of luciferase (14Wei L. Zhou W. Croissant J.D. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Balasubramanyam A. Schwartz R.J. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in a concentration-dependent manner, both nifedipine and verapamil significantly inhibited luciferase expression (Fig.6). Normalized luciferase levels for cultures treated with nifedipine were 80.4, 81.8, 37.4, and 7.7% at 1, 10, 50, and 100 μm, respectively. Specimens treated with 1, 10, 50, and 100 μm verapamil expressed luciferase at 92.1, 94.5, 25.6, and 0.6% of control, respectively. Therefore, this third index demonstrates that lowering intracellular calcium levels inhibits C2C12 differentiation. It is becoming clear that many extracellular signals regulate the expression of genes essential for striated myocyte differentiation (7Delling U. Tureckova J. Lim H.W. De Windt L.J. Rotwein P. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6600-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar,10Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M.P. Olson E.N.

However, the intracellular pathways that transduce these signals to the nucleus are only beginning to be understood. Previous reports have suggested that calcium-activated signaling cascades may play an important role in intracellular signaling during myocyte differentiation (7Delling U. Tureckova J. Lim H.W. De Windt L.J. Rotwein P. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6600-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Semsarian C. Wu M.J. Ju Y.K. Marciniec T. Yeoh T. Allen D.G. Harvey R.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21227-21232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Using C2C12 cells as a model of myocyte differentiation, we demonstrate that the maintenance of normal intracellular calcium concentrations is vital to myocyte gene expression and differentiation. Using a calcium-sensitive dye and confocal microscopy, we first demonstrated that electrically stimulated calcium transients were inhibited by calcium channel blockade. These results are not unexpected because differentiating C2C12 cells are known to express L-type calcium channels (27Varadi G. Orlowski J. Schwartz A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These data also agree with previous reports that calcium channel blockade decreases the frequency and amplitude of calcium transients in C2C12 cultures and in primary cultures of skeletal myocytes (25Huang C.F. Flucher B.E. Schmidt M.M. Stroud S.K. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 167-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Challet C. Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Ruegg U.T. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 3281-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is interesting that verapamil was not as effective as nifedipine in these experiments. The binding of verapamil to L-type calcium channels is enhanced if the channel is actively opening and closing (31Hofmann F. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 139: 33-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, these findings were not unexpected due to the acute treatments used in these experiments. In addition, other experiments demonstrated that verapamil lowered calcium transient amplitude more effectively if specimens were stimulated at 0.5 Hz during each 2-min treatment period. 2G. A. Porter and S. A. Rivkees, unpublished observations. Having established the concentrations of nifedipine and verapamil required to effectively decrease intracellular calcium concentration, we found that calcium channel blockade profoundly inhibited myoblast differentiation. Visual observations of C2C12 cells induced to differentiate in the presence of nifedipine or verapamil demonstrated that decreasing intracellular calcium levels inhibited the formation of multinucleated myotubes. Three additional quantitative indices supported this finding. First, immunolabeling and calculation of a differentiation index quantified gross morphologic observations. Second, decreased expression of myogenin and increased expression of Myf5 in cells treated with both drugs demonstrated that the genetic program required for normal differentiation was disrupted. Third, the expression of actin and myosin, two structural genes present in the mature contractile apparatus, was inhibited by calcium channel blockade. We then treated C2C12 cells with dantrolene and thapsigargin to demonstrate that these effects were due to decreased intracellular calcium levels and not due to some other effect of calcium channel blockade. Dantrolene inhibits calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and thus decreases sarcoplasmic calcium (21Vali S. Carlsen R. Pessah I. Gorin F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 184-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In contrast, thapsigargin blocks reuptake of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and thus eventually depletes total cellular calcium (21Vali S. Carlsen R. Pessah I. Gorin F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 184-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As with nifedipine and verapamil, treatment of C2C12 cells with these agents also prevented morphologic differentiation. Therefore, these data support the hypothesis that decreased intracellular calcium levels inhibit differentiation of muscle cells. Potential mechanisms of this calcium-mediated modulation of differentiation and gene expression include alterations in protein degradation, in mRNA stabilization, or in gene transcription. The latter mechanism appears to be most important during differentiation, but evidence exists to support a role for the former two mechanisms. For example, calpain-mediated protein degradation appears to allow cell fusion and differentiation of C2C12 cells (13Temm-Grove C.J. Wert D. Thompson V.F. Allen R.E. Goll D.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, increased levels of intracellular calcium appear to stabilize mRNA encoding the inward-rectifying potassium channel 1 (26Shin K.S. Park J.Y. Kwon H. Chung C.H. Kang M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21227-21232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, regulation of gene transcription appears to play a major role in calcium-mediated modulation of differentiation. Recent reports suggest that this occurs via the activation of a number of phosphatases and kinases, including calcineurin, CaMK isoforms, and protein kinase C. These enzymes alter the activity of transcriptional activating factors, such as cAMP-response element-binding protein, MEF2, Myf5, myogenin, nuclear factor of activated T cells, and serum response factor (3Frey N.

In conclusion, our data suggest that mammalian skeletal myoblast differentiation is dependent upon normal intracellular calcium concentrations. Future experiments using other methods to alter intracellular calcium levels should further define the relationship between intracellular calcium concentrations and myoblast differentiation. In addition, these experiments may also help determine which calcium-dependent pathways contribute to the integration of signals that drive skeletal myofiber development. We thank Drs.

Particularly, all archaeal genomes sequenced to date contain genes encoding homologues of Lrp (leucine-responsiveregulatory protein). Whereas Lrp-like proteins in bacteria are involved in regulation of amino acid metabolism, their physiological role in archaea is unknown. Although several archaeal Lrp-like proteins have been characterized recently, no target genes apart from their own coding genes have been discovered yet, and no ligands for these regulators have been identified so far. In this study, we show that the Lrp-like protein LysM from Sulfolobus solfataricus is involved in the regulation of lysine and possibly also arginine biosynthesis, encoded by the lys gene cluster. Exogenous lysine is the regulatory signal for lysgene expression and specifically serves as a ligand for LysM by altering its DNA binding affinity. LysM binds directly upstream of the TFB-responsive element of the intrinsically weak lysWpromoter, and DNA binding is favored in the absence of lysine, whenlysWXJK transcription is maximal. The combined in vivo and in vitro data are most compatible with a model in which the bacterial-like LysM activates the eukarya-like transcriptional machinery. As with transcriptional activation by Escherichia coli Lrp, activation by LysM is apparently dependent on a co-activator, which remains to be identified.

RNA polymerase TATA-binding protein transcription factor TFB-responsive element avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase α-aminoadipic acid electrophoretic mobility shift assay preinitiation complex Since the discovery of archaea as a distinct domain of life, many studies have focused on archaeal transcription. It has become clear that although archaea resemble bacteria with respect to their cellular and genetic organization, their transcriptional apparatus is fundamentally different from that of bacteria. Their RNA polymerase (RNAP)1 is much more related to the eukaryal RNAPII system regarding subunit complexity and sequence homology (1Langer D. Hain J. Thuriaux P. Zillig W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5768-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, archaeal RNAP consists of at least 10 subunits in contrast to the five-subunit bacterial RNAP core enzyme. As in eukarya, archaeal transcription initiation is preceded by the binding of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to a TATA-like sequence called the TATA-box and subsequent binding of transcription factor B (TFB). Archaeal TBP and TFB are highly homologous to the eukaryal TBP and TFIIB, respectively. However, archaeal TBP is not complexed with TBP-associated factors as in eukarya (2Qureshi S.A. Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2927-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and there is no evidence that archaeal genomes encode TBP-associated factor homologues. The archaeal TATA-box is 8 bp in length and is located ∼25 bp upstream of the start of transcription. Directly upstream of the TATA-box, a purine-rich sequence is present, called the TFB-responsive element (BRE). The BRE was shown to be an important determinant in directionality of transcription and promoter strength through interaction with a C-terminal helix-turn-helix domain of TFB (3Bell S.D. Kosa P.L. Sigler P.B. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 13662-13667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Littlefield O. Korkhin Y. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 13668-13673Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The TF(II)B-BRE interaction is a conserved feature between archaea and eukarya. Once TBP and TFB are bound to the promoter, RNAP is recruited, involving an interaction between the RpoK subunit of RNAP and the N-terminal zinc ribbon domain of TFB (5Magill C.P. Jackson S.P. Bell S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46693-46696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Although no archaeal homologues of eukaryal TFIIA, TFIIF, and TFIIH have been identified, a protein homologous to the N-terminal region of the α-subunit of eukaryal TFIIE is present in archaea. This archaeal TFE stimulates transcription from promoters with suboptimal TATA-box sequences or in cases where TBP is limiting (6Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7Hanzelka B.L. Darcy T.J. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1813-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whereas eukaryal TFIIE is strictly necessary for transcription, archaeal TFE appears to be dispensable for basal transcription in vitro, although it may play a stimulatory role in transcription initiation at specific promoters.Although the basal components of the archaeal and eukaryal transcription machineries are very similar, regulatory proteins do not appear to be conserved between the two domains. Instead, archaeal genomes contain many regulators previously identified only in bacteria, so-called bacterial-archaeal regulators (8Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In particular, homologues of the Lrp/AsnC family of regulators appear to be widely distributed among both bacteria and archaea. Several bacterial as well as archaeal genomes contain up to 10 Lrp-like paralogues. Escherichia coli Lrp (leucine-responsive regulatoryprotein) is the paradigm that has been studied extensively (9Calvo J.M. Matthews R.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 466-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Newman E.B. Lin R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 747-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is a global regulator controlling the expression of up to 75 genes (11Lin R. D'Ari R. Newman E.B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1948-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ernsting B.R. Atkinson M.R. Ninfa A.J. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli Lrp either represses or activates transcription, the effect of which is sometimes modulated by leucine. The target genes of E. coli Lrp encode enzymes that are directly or indirectly related to amino acid metabolism. This also appears to be the case for several specific (nonglobal) bacterial Lrp-like regulators from different bacteria. In archaea, the exact role of the numerous Lrp-like proteins has not been established. Several archaeal Lrp-like proteins have been characterized recently (13Napoli A. van der Oost J. Sensen C.W.

For two of these proteins, Lrs14 from Sulfolobus solfataricus and LrpA from Pyrococcus furiosus, anin vitro regulatory function could be assigned; both showed negative autoregulation independent of any amino acid ligand (14Bell S.D.

Moreover, the three-dimensional structure of P. furiosusLrpA was determined, providing the structural basis for understanding LrpA-DNA as well as LrpA-ligand interactions (17Leonard P.M. Smits S.H.J. Sedelnikova S.E. Brinkman A.B. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. Rice D.W. Rafferty J.B. EMBO J. 2000; 20: 990-997Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, neither the identity of this ligand nor the role of archaeal Lrp-like proteins in the expression of other genes has been determined.To provide a suitable model system for analyzing the function of Lrp-like proteins in archaea, we have screened the genome of the hyperthermophilic archaeon S. solfataricus for the presence of Lrp-like proteins whose function, target, and ligand may be readily predicted. We have identified and characterized the Lrp-like protein LysM, the gene of which is clustered with genes encoding lysine biosynthetic enzymes. We show here that expression of thelysWXJK genes is regulated by the presence of lysine in the medium. In vitro LysM binds to the lysW promoter, and binding is favored in the absence of lysine, when lysgene expression is maximal. A model is proposed for lysine-modulated activation of transcription through LysM, for the first time indicating that a bacterial-like regulator may activate the eukarya-like archaeal transcriptional machinery. It appears that Lrp-like proteins are functionally equivalent in the bacterial and archaeal domains, despite the fundamental differences in transcriptional machineries.DISCUSSIONGenomic sequence data have revealed that Lrp-like proteins are ubiquitously present in bacteria and archaea. Although Lrp fromE. coli is the archetype Lrp-like protein, more than a dozen bacterial Lrp-like proteins have been studied either in vitro or using genetic approaches, and it is clear that these proteins are all involved in the regulation of amino acid metabolism and that amino acids serve as ligands for Lrp-like proteins.2 Efficient genetic tools to study gene regulation (like recombination or gene disruption) are not yet available for hyperthermophilic archaea, and we have used a bioinformatics approach in combination with in vivo and in vitro analyses to identify and study the archaeal Lrp-like protein LysM from S. solfataricus, the gene of which is present in the lysgene cluster. This allowed us for the first time to study the role and function of an archaeal Lrp-like protein in relation to its physiological target genes.Regulation of lys transcription in S. solfataricus is responsive to lysine only, which strongly suggests that the lys genes are involved in lysine biosynthesis, most likely via a pathway similar to that of T. thermophilus, where gene disruption of the homologous lys cluster resulted in lysine auxotrophy (24Nishida H. Nishiyama M. Kobashi N. Kosuge T. Hoshino T. Yamane H. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The pathway utilized here involves AAA rather than diaminopimelic acid, the typical bacterial precursor (25Kosuge T. Hoshino T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 169: 361-367PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kobashi N. Nishiyama M. Tanokura M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although arginine has no effect on lystranscription, we cannot rule out the possibility thatlys-encoded enzymes are also functional in arginine biosynthesis, as was proposed for the lys gene cluster ofPyrococcus horikoshii (24Nishida H. Nishiyama M. Kobashi N. Kosuge T. Hoshino T. Yamane H. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, dual activity has been measured for LysJ and LysK of T. thermophilus, homologues ofS. solfataricus LysJ and LysK, respectively, suggesting that the lys gene cluster could indeed be involved in arginine as well as lysine biosynthesis (23Miyazaki J. Kobashi N. Nishiyama M. Yamane H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5067-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Miyazaki J. Kobashi N. Fujii T. Nishiyama M. Yamane H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Why is the lys gene cluster of S. solfataricusorganized in a constitutive (lysYZM) and a regulated part (lysWXJK)? Possibly, down-regulation of thelysYZM is not permitted because this would abolish regulation of the lysWXJK genes through LysM, the gene of which is co-transcribed with lysZY. Our data do not exclude the possibility that LysM has additional targets in the genome ofS. solfataricus, but if this were the case, down-regulation of lysM could result in an even more serious loss of regulatory capacity in S. solfataricus. Alternatively, one of the enzyme activities encoded by lysYZM could be indispensable for growth under the conditions tested. The genomic organization of lysM in the lys cluster is identical in other Sulfolobus species and functionally comparable with that of A. pernix, where thelysYZM cluster is inverted (Fig. 1A), most likely allowing a similar mode of regulation.Although the role of lysW and lysX has not been demonstrated experimentally, we speculate that they are specific for the prokaryotic AAA lysine biosynthesis route proposed by Nishidaet al. (24Nishida H. Nishiyama M. Kobashi N. Kosuge T. Hoshino T. Yamane H. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), since they are clustered within thelys clusters of T. thermophilus, S. acidocaldarius, S. tokodai, A. pernix, Pyrococcus species, and Ferroplasma acidarmanus and because the classical arginine or lysine pathways do not involve such genes. LysX is 24% identical to RimK ofE. coli, which was shown to be a post-translational modification enzyme, catalyzing the coupling of four glutamate residues to the C terminus of the S6 ribosomal protein (34Kang W.K. Icho T. Isono S. Kitakawa M. Isono K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 217: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, we found that in several prokaryotic genomes rimK-like genes are clustered with amino acid biosynthesis genes (not shown), suggesting that the catalytic activity of the rimK-encoded protein here is not utilized for a post-translational modification but rather in amino acid biosynthesis. Interestingly, Galperin et al. (35Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2639-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) demonstrated that RimK belongs to a superfamily of enzymes with a so-called “ATP grasp” fold. This family includes enzymes like d-alanine-d-alanine ligase, glutathione synthetase, biotin carboxylase, and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. All of these enzymes possess ATP-dependent carboxylate-amine ligase activity (i.e. the capacity to form a peptide bond). In the proposed AAA-dependent lysine biosynthesis route described by Nishida et al. (24Nishida H. Nishiyama M. Kobashi N. Kosuge T. Hoshino T. Yamane H. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), LysX was predicted to catalyze a similar reaction, namely connecting the amino group of AAA to the carboxyl group of a yet unidentified molecule. By doing so, LysX catalyzes a reaction functionally analogous to that of ArgA (N-acteylglutamate synthase) in the classical arginine biosynthesis pathway, the gene of which is absent in all lys clusters shown in Fig. 1A.The small protein encoded by lysW has no homologues in the data base, apart from lysW genes found in thelys clusters depicted in Fig. 1A. A PSI-BLAST analysis (36Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59182) Google Scholar) of LysW showed that this small protein is homologous to the N-terminal domain of archaeal TFB transcription factors (not shown). After four iterations, an expect value of ≥10−11was obtained with TFB N-terminal domains from several archaea. This domain consists of a zinc ribbon (37Zhu W. Zeng Q. Colangelo C.M. Lewis M. Summers M.F. Scott R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and the two CPXCG “zinc knuckle” motifs that bind the zinc atom are well conserved in LysW. The zinc ribbon domain of Sulfolobus TFB has been shown to be involved in the recruitment of RNA polymerase (RNAP) (38Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), through interaction with the RpoK subunit of RNAP (5Magill C.P. Jackson S.P. Bell S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46693-46696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Generally, zinc ribbon domains mediate protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions and can be found for instance in several eukaryal transcription factors. LysW may therefore interact with one of the encoded enzymes of thelys gene cluster, perhaps acting as a regulatory subunit for the respective enzymatic activity, or it could play a regulatory role in lys transcription. However, LysW is also encoded by thelys gene cluster of T. thermophilus, which possesses a bacterial basal transcription machinery, and it is questionable whether involvement in transcription here is possible. It should be noted, however, that the RpoK subunit, with which the TFB zinc ribbon interacts, is a conserved subunit in RNAPs of eukarya (RPB6) and bacteria (ω). Unfortunately, our attempts to produce the LysW protein in E. coli were unsuccessful.The data presented in this study strongly suggest that LysM acts as a transcriptional activator for PlysW. We found that transcription from PlysW is maximal when lysine is absent, and under these conditions the affinity of LysM for binding this promoter is the highest. Conversely, in the presence of lysine, transcription is lowest, and the binding affinity of LysM is decreased. It is most likely that LysM occupies PlysW preferably when lysine is absent, thereby somehow activating this promoter. Although lysine reduces rather than eliminates LysM-DNA binding, this reduction is expected to be physiologically important. As shown in Fig. 4, D and E, the effect of lysine is maximal at a low LysM concentration, presumably a relevant cellular condition (using Western blotting analysis, we roughly estimated the abundance of LysM to be about 0.01% of total soluble protein, not shown). This reduction rather than elimination of binding has also been observed for other (bacterial) Lrp-like proteins (39Ernsting B.R. Denninger J.W. Blumenthal R.M. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Roesch P.L. Blomfield I.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 41Zhi J. Mathew E.

Biol. 1999; 288: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and may therefore be a general feature of Lrp-like proteins. Using in vivo formaldehyde cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation of cross-linked LysM-DNA complexes, we have attempted to relate results from in vitrobinding studies with in vivo LysM promoter occupation, but unfortunately the results of these experiments were irreproducible. Nevertheless, to a certain extent, our study is comparable with the regulation of E. coli ilvIH by Lrp. For example, Lrp activates ilvIH transcription, and this activation is decreased when leucine is present in the medium (44Platko J.V. Willins D.A. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4563-4570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance, the Lrp-ilvIH affinity in vitro is reduced but not eliminated by leucine (45Ricca E. Aker D.A. Calvo J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1658-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For ilvIH, this reduction of binding in vitro could be related to an in vivodecrease in promoter occupancy using in vivo footprinting experiments (46Marasco R. Varcamonti M., La Cara F. Ricca E., De Felice M. Sacco M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5197-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we anticipate that this in vitro-in vivo relationship can also be made for LysM.Our DNase I footprint data support the possibility that LysM is an activator, since it showed that LysM protects the bases −46 to −59 relative to the transcriptional start site, whereas the TBP-TFB-RNAP preinitiation complex has previously been shown to protect the bases −43 to +8 at Sulfolobus viral T6 promoter (38Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Hence, LysM binding is not expected to interfere with or occupy the target sites for TBP, TFB, or RNAP but rather binds upstream of these proteins, as is usually the case for activators. In many cases, these activators recruit components or stabilize binding of the preinitiation complex (PIC) through direct contacts. However, such direct contacts have not yet been shown for Lrp-like proteins. Alternatively, activation could involve promoter remodeling in which the secondary structure of the promoter DNA is changed, for instance by bending the DNA in a certain angle. This altered DNA structure could subsequently be recognized more efficiently by one of the components of the PIC. In this case, activation of transcription would be independent of direct contacts between the activator and the PIC components. As shown in Fig.5A, binding of LysM induces several DNase I-hypersensitive sites, indicative of DNA secondary structure changes. Interestingly, one of the hypersensitive sites is located between the BRE and TATA-box, representing a structural alteration that is potentially able to alter the interaction properties of TBP/TFB with the DNA. In addition, the intensity of some of the LysM-induced hypersensitive sites is somewhat changed in the presence of lysine. However, the magnitude of this effect is less obvious than the effect of lysine observed in EMSAs (Fig. 4). We have tested the ability of LysM to bend its target DNA by using the pBEND2 system described by Kim et al. (47Kim J. Zwieb C., Wu, C. Adhya S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we cloned the 24-bp fragment used for Fig. 5, B and C, into pBEND2 and used it as described (47Kim J. Zwieb C., Wu, C. Adhya S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), but no LysM-induced bending was observed, either in the presence or absence of lysine. The possibility cannot be ruled out, however, that low affinity binding to sequences outside the chosen sequence fragment contributes to the LysM-DNA interaction and bending.Our in vitro transcription experiments showed that compared with the T6 control promoter (2Qureshi S.A. Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2927-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), transcription from PlysY and PlysW is very weak. We showed previously that PlysYcould be stimulated by the addition of TFE (6Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (referred to as PargC), but this was not possible for PlysW. Apparently, both promoters are intrinsically weak promoters, which is in agreement with the low homology to the Sulfolobusconsensus promoter sequence. It is therefore possible that binding of TBP and/or TFB might be impaired at PlysW. In agreement with this, in an EMSA we could not observe any interaction between PlysW DNA and (combinations of) these transcription factors, and the addition of LysM or lysine had no effect (not shown). Altogether, our results thus suggest that the intrinsic activity of PlysW promoters is very low. In contrast, lysWXJKmRNA could easily be detected in Northern blotting and primer extension experiments, suggesting efficient transcription in vivo. Since we have proven that both PlysY and PlysW are true promoters in vivo, we suggest that at least for PlysW, additional factors like co-regulators may be required for efficient transcription. Thus, under our experimental conditions, LysM is not able to activate transcription, but in the presence of such an unidentified factor, transcription may take place. In comparison, some E. coli promoters that belong to the Lrp regulon require an additional DNA-binding protein (e.g.integration host factor (IHF) (48Paul L. Blumenthal R.M. Matthews R.G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3910-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), histone-like protein H-NS (49Levinthal M. Lejeune P. Danchin A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 736-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), or catabolite activator protein (CAP) (50Mathew E. Zhi J. Freundlich M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7234-7240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Weyand N.J. Braaten B.A. van der Woude M. Tucker J. Low D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1504-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). To identify such proteins in S. solfataricus, we have taken several approaches. First, in our in vitro transcription experiments, we have added cell extracts of S. solfataricus grown in the absence of lysine, but no stimulation of transcription in vitro was observed. Second, we have performed pull-down experiments in which glutathione S-transferase (GST) was fused to LysM and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. An S. solfataricuscell extract was subsequently screened for proteins interacting with GST-LysM. We found that a single protein interacted with LysM, but this protein was identified as the LysM protein itself, most likely being the result of multimerization of GST-LysM and wild-type LysM during the experiment (data not shown).The observation that LysM is conserved in the lysclusters of three Sulfolobus species and in A. pernix suggests that it plays a similar role in these organisms. We have therefore compared the sequence of their putativelysW promoters to identify a possible consensus LysM binding site. Indeed, a conserved GGTTC inverted repeat element is present, as shown in Fig. 8. For the putativelysW promoters of Sulfolobus species, the position of the presumptive LysM binding site is very similar (overlapping the lysM stop codon), whereas in A. pernix, where the lys gene cluster is organized in a somewhat different way (see Fig. 1A), the putative LysM site is centered between the lysY and lysW genes. It is remarkable that this LysM binding site is conserved and highly palindromic, since this is usually not the case for naturally occurring binding sites of Lrp-like proteins (9Calvo J.M. Matthews R.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 466-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Brinkman A.B. Dahlke I. Tuininga J.E. Lammers T. Dumay V. de Heus E. Lebbink J.H. Thomm M. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 636-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have derived a consensus LysM site from the alignment given in Fig. 8, and we used this sequence to screen the S. solfataricus and A. pernix genomes for LysM sites, but no additional LysM binding sites could be identified.Several archaeal Lrp-like proteins have been characterized recently (13Napoli A. van der Oost J. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol.

Unlike previously studied archaeal Lrp-like proteins, lysM is expressed constitutively and not negatively autoregulated. Moreover, LysM strongly resembles bacterial Lrp-like proteins and appears to be a specific rather than a global regulator, since it is clustered with its target genes. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that LysM has additional targets in theS. solfataricus genome, and experiments are necessary to confirm this. Furthermore, all bacterial Lrp-like proteins characterized to date act as transcriptional repressors or activators involved in the regulation of amino acid metabolism, and all ligands identified so far were found to be amino acids.

Madin-Darby canine kidney cells ricin 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2–2′-disulfonic acid UDP-galactose is a substrate used in the synthesis of non-cellulosic polysaccharides and glycoproteins. The incorporation of galactose into these macromolecules is catalyzed by galactosyltransferases, which are thought to be localized in the Golgi apparatus (1Reid J.S.G. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A galactosyltransferase from fenugreek involved in the synthesis of galactomannans has been recently cloned (2Edwards M.E. Dickson C.A. Chengappa S. Sidebottom C. Gidley M.J. Reid J.S.G. Plant J. 1999; 19: 691-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The information derived from the primary sequence of this protein suggests that this enzyme is a membrane-bound protein with its catalytic site facing the lumen of the Golgi cisternae. This orientation is similar to galactosyltransferases involved in protein glycosylation of animal cells. Because it is likely that transfer of galactose to non-cellulosic polysaccharides and glycoproteins takes place in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, transport of UDP-galactose should be required to fulfill this process. UDP-galactose transporters have been described in animal cells,Drosophila, and yeast (3Miura N. Ishida N. Hoshino M. Yamauchi M. Hara T. Ayusawa D. Kawakita M. J. Biochem.

Expression of these genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiaefollowed by in vitro transport assays into Golgi vesicles confirmed that the gene products actually transport UDP-galactose (12Sun-Wada G-H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These genes encode proteins with a molecular mass of around 35 kDa; their hydrophobicity plots predict that they have 8–10 transmembrane domains. Despite the potential importance of UDP-galactose transporter in the synthesis of cell wall components, a UDP-galactose transport activity has not been characterized in the plant Golgi apparatus, and a gene encoding for a UDP-galactose transporter has not yet been identified. Here we report that sealed Golgi vesicles isolated from pea stems transport UDP-galactose and transfer galactose to endogenous acceptors. In addition, we cloned a cDNA from A. thaliana, namedAtUTr1 for ArabidopsisthalianaUDP-galactoseTransporter 1 that was functionally characterized by complementing a Golgi UDP-galactose transporter mutant, expressing it in S. cerevisiae, and measuring transport in vitro of nucleotide sugars in Golgi-enriched vesicles. The results show that AtUTr1 encodes a nucleotide sugar transporter able to transport both UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose, although it does not use other nucleotide sugars tested. Transport of UDP-galactose into plant Golgi vesicles supports a model in which galactosylation of polysaccharides and other acceptors such as lipids occurs in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, and the AtUTr1 gene product fromArabidopsis could be involved in that process. UDP-[3H]galactose (12 Ci/mmol), UDP-[3H]glucose (21 Ci/mmol) GDP-[3H]fucose (17.3 Ci/mmol), UDP-[3H]xylose (10 Ci/mmol), CMP-[3H]N-acetylneuraminic acid (32.8 Ci/mmol), GDP-[3H]mannose (18.9 Ci/mmol), sodium [3H]acetate (4.1 Ci/mmol), and [3H]deoxyglucose (29.8 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]UDP-glucuronic acid was enzymatically prepared as described by Orellana and Mohnen (13Orellana A. Mohnen D. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A Golgi-enriched vesicle fraction was isolated from the third internode of 7-day-old etiolated pea seedlings as described previously by Muñoz et al. (14Muñoz P. Norambuena L. Orellana A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The orientation and integrity of these vesicles was confirmed measuring latency of the luminal enzymes UDPase and xyloglucan α-(1–2)-fucosyltransferase (15Wulff C. Norambuena L. Orellana A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Proteolysis was carried out as described by Wulff et al. (15Wulff C. Norambuena L. Orellana A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, vesicles were treated with proteinase K (40 ng per 1 μg of Golgi vesicles protein) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the samples were kept on ice until they were used in the UDP-galactose uptake assays. The luminal UDPase activity was determined as described by Orellana et al.(16Orellana A. Neckelmann G. Norambuena L. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, Golgi vesicles were solubilized using 1.5% Triton X-100. Samples were separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and the activity was measured in the presence of 3 mm UDP and 1.5 mm Pb(NO3)2. The inorganic phosphate released during the reaction formed an insoluble complex with lead, which is then visualized with 1% (NH4)2S. Golgi vesicles were incubated with 1 μmUDP-[3H]galactose in a medium containing 0.25m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm MgCl2 (STM buffer). To stop the reaction, the vesicles were diluted in cold STM buffer and filtered through 0.7-μm glass fiber filters. Subsequently the filters were washed with an additional 10 volumes of cold STM buffer and dried, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Transport of UDP-galactose was measured using a modification of the method described by Perez and Hirschberg (17Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Golgi vesicles (1 mg of protein) were incubated in STM buffer at 25 °C with 1 μm UDP-[3H]galactose (specific activity, 788 cpm/pmol). The final volume was 0.4 ml. After 5 min the reaction was stopped by dilution using 4 ml of cold STM buffer, and the vesicles were immediately separated from the incubation medium by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The vesicle pellet was surface-washed and resuspended in 500 μl of water. The sample was brought to 70% ethanol and kept on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the radioactivity associated with the 70% ethanol-insoluble material was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry (TPs). The 70% ethanol-soluble material was dried, resuspended in 100 μl of water, and extracted with 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (5:1). The water-soluble UDP-[3H]galactose (St) and the radioactivity present at the organic phase plus the insoluble fraction that remained at the interface were determined (TP+L). The amount of UDP-galactose within the vesicles (Si) was calculated by subtracting the estimated amount of radioactive UDP-[3H]galactose outside the vesicles (So) from St as described by Perez and Hirschberg (17Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To calculate the amount of substrate outside the vesicles (So), the concentration of substrate in the medium was multiplied by the volume outside the vesicles in the pellet (Vo), which was calculated using the non-penetrator [3H]acetate. The total volume in the pellet (Vt) was calculated using [3H]deoxyglucose, which penetrates the vesicles. Thus the internal volume (Vi), required to estimate the internal concentrations of substrates, was determined by subtracting Vo from Vt. AtUTr1 cDNA was amplified from the A. thaliana cDNA library pFL61 (American Type Culture Collection) using Platinum Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers flanking the coding region, designed from the genomic sequence. The upstream primer was TCTAGGATCCTAATGGAGGTCCATGGCTCC and contained aBamHI restriction site (underlined sequence). The downstream primer was ATGAGCGGCCGCCTTCCACTCTTTTGCTTC and contained aNotI site (underlined sequence). A single amplification product of the expected size (1 kb) was obtained. After verification by sequencing, the product was digested with BamHI andNotI and cloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1-MycHis version A (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA-AtUTr1-MycHis. For expression in S. cerevisiae, a vector derived from p426GPD (18Mumberg D. Mu¨ller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar) was engineered to contain a MycHis tag as follows. A 237-bp fragment containing the MycHis tag was amplified from pcDNA3.1-MycHis using the reverse and T7 primer, digested withBamHI and ligated toBamHI/SmaI-digested p426GPD to generate p426GPD-MycHis. The 1-kb PCR product containing AtUTr1cDNA was digested with BamHI and NotI and ligated to BamHI/NotI-digested p426GPD-MycHis vector to generate p426GPD-AtUTr1-MycHis. S. cerevisiae strain RSY255 (MATa, ura3–52, 112) transformed with the URA plasmids p426GPD-MycHis and p426GPD-AtUTr1-MycHis were grown at 30 °C in liquid medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, and SCM-URA. Transformation with the plasmids was performed using lithium acetate and followed standard procedures. S. cerevisiae transformed with the p426GPD-MycHis and p426GPD-AtUTr1-MycHis plasmids were grown, and spheroplasts were prepared using Zymolyase100T as described by Berninsone et al. (19Berninsone P. Hwang H.Y. Zemtseva I. Horvitz H.R. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3738-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cells were then disrupted by pipetting the cell suspension up and down and then centrifuged successively at 450 × g, 10,000 × g,and 100,000 × g to obtain pellet fractions P1, P2, and P3. The last fraction, P3, was enriched in Golgi apparatus-derived vesicles (20Goud B. Salminen A. Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 753-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The expression of AtUTr1 in microsomal membranes was monitored by Western blotting using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and a c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Transport assays were performed as described by Berninsone et al. (19Berninsone P. Hwang H.Y. Zemtseva I. Horvitz H.R. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3738-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Yeast Golgi-enriched vesicles (1 mg of protein from fraction P3) were incubated at 30 °C in the presence of the radioactive nucleotide sugar to be tested. After 3 min the vesicles were separated from the incubation medium by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 50 min. The pellet was washed and resuspended in 4% perchloric acid, and the total acid-soluble radioactive nucleotide sugar (St) was determined. The amount of radioactivity inside the vesicles (Si) was calculated by subtracting the estimated amount of radioactive nucleotide sugar outside the vesicles (So) from the standards. MDCK and MDCK-RCAr (21Meiss H.K. Green R.F. Rodriguez-Boulan E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) cells were grown in complete medium (minimal essential medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics) at 37 °C. MDCK-RCAr cells were transfected with pcDNA3-MycHis and pcDNA-AtUTr1-MycHis using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Transfectants were selected using complete medium containing 0.8 mg/ml geneticin (G418). Geneticin-resistant colonies were cloned, and resistance to ricin was determined by plating 2000 cells/well in 24-well plates using complete medium containing 0.1 μg/ml RCAII (EY Laboratories, San Mateo, CA). After 7 days of exposure to RCAII at 37 °C, surviving cells were determined by staining with 1% methylene blue in 50% methanol. Total RNA was extracted from 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings using Trizol (Invitrogen) and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using oligo(dT) cellulose (MessageMaker mRNA Isolation System; Invitrogen). Total RNA (40 μg) and poly(A)+ RNA (2.5 μg) were fractionated by electrophoresis in an agarose gel containing formaldehyde and capillary transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N+; AmershamBiosciences) using 10× SSC. A 32P-radiolabeled DNA probe was prepared from the AtUTr1 cDNA fragment using a random priming oligolabeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization and all the other procedures were done as described by Orellanaet al. (22Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the topology of galactosylation and transport of UDP-galactose into the plant Golgi apparatus we analyzed the uptake of UDP-[3H]galactose into sealed, right-side-out pea stem Golgi vesicles using a filtration assay. Uptake of UDP-[3H]galactose was higher at 25 than at 0 °C and decreased close to background levels when vesicles were heat-inactivated before the assay (Fig.1). These results suggest that a protein-mediated process was involved in the uptake of UDP-galactose. Permeabilization of the vesicles prior to the assay using low concentrations of Triton X-100 did not significantly change the uptake of UDP-[3H]galactose, suggesting that little UDP-[3H]galactose was free in the lumen, and likely [3H]galactose was transferred to endogenous acceptors that remained associated to the permeabilized vesicles. Treatment of the vesicles with proteinase K caused a decrease in the uptake of UDP-galactose (Fig. 2). This treatment did not affect the activity of a luminal Golgi UDPase (16Orellana A. Neckelmann G. Norambuena L. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) measured in native gels. As seen in Fig. 2B, the activity band detected in Golgi vesicles was still present in proteinase K-treated vesicles, whereas this activity band disappeared when Triton X-100-permeabilized Golgi vesicles were treated with the protease. These results suggest that proteinase K treatment did not alter the integrity of Golgi vesicles; therefore, a protein (or proteins) located in the cytosolic face of the Golgi membrane would be required for the uptake and/or the transfer to acceptors. Permeabilization of the proteinase-K treated vesicles led to an increase in the incorporation of radioactive substrate into the Golgi vesicles, indicating that galactosyltransferases were still active and suggesting that, like the UDPase, these galactosyltransferases were located in the lumen. Proteinase K treatment of vesicles already permeabilized decreased the uptake of UDP-[3H]galactose under all conditions, suggesting that proteolysis affected the luminal galactosyltransferases. These results suggested that galactosyltransferases are located in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, and UDP-galactose should be transported into Golgi vesicles. The addition of DIDS (4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2–2′-disulfonic acid), a known inhibitor of nucleotide sugar and anionic transporters (23Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4263-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), decreased the uptake of UDP-galactose supporting the idea that transport of UDP-galactose takes place in the plant Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1).Figure 2UDP-galactose uptake into Golgi vesicles is sensitive to protease treatment.A, Golgi vesicles were incubated with (+) and without (−) proteinase K in the presence (+) and absence (−) of 0.1% Triton X-100 as described under “Materials and Methods.” These vesicles were immediately used in UDP-[3H]galactose uptake experiments, performed in the absence (white bars, intact vesicles) or presence (black bars, permeabilized vesicles) of 0.1% Triton X-100.B, the activity of a luminal UDPase using native gels. Upon electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel the UDPase activity was detected using 3 mm UDP. The arrowheads indicate the position of the luminal Golgi UDPase. Proteinase K treatment in Triton X-100-permeabilized Golgi vesicles produced proteolytic fragments still active, which are shown with a bracket. Treatment with Triton X-100 alone had no effect on the mobility of the UDPase activity (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To provide additional evidence that pea stem Golgi vesicles are able to transport UDP-galactose we used the method described by Perez and Hirschberg (17Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that allows the estimation of the amount of UDP-galactose located inside the vesicles (Si) as well as its concentration ([Si]) within the vesicles upon incubation of Golgi vesicles with UDP-[3H]galactose. Table I shows that the content of UDP-[3H]galactose within the pea vesicles (Si) was higher at 25 than at 0 °C, suggesting that transport of UDP-[3H]galactose was temperature-dependent. Incubation of Golgi vesicles with UDP-[3H]galactose resulted in a significant transfer of radioactivity into 70% ethanol-insoluble material, suggesting that [3H]galactose was transferred to polysaccharides. The 70% ethanol-soluble material was subjected to chloroform/methanol partitioning, where part of the radioactive material became insoluble, and the other part became soluble in the organic phase, suggesting that [3H]galactose was transferred to glycolipids and glycoproteins. Transfer to acceptors was also temperature-dependent (Table I).Table ITransport of UDP-galactose into pea stem Golgi vesiclesT ° Solutes within vesicles Si Transfer to 70% ethanol-insoluble acceptors TPsTransfer to acceptors at the organic phase + the aqueous/organic interface TP+L Total transport (Si+TPs+TP+L) Concentration of solutes in the vesicles [Si] Concentration of solutes in incubation medium [Sm] Latency of vesicles°Cpmol/mgpmol/mgpmol/mgpmol/mgμmμm% 00.38 ± 0.111.12 ± 0.110.74 ± 0.152.25 ± 0.300.06 ± 0.020.97 ± 0.0289251.62 ± 0.319.54 ± 0.894.57 ± 0.1315.73 ± 1.070.25 ± 0.050.90 ± 0.04Golgi vesicles (1 mg) were incubated with 1 μmUDP-[3H]galactose for 5 min in a final volume of 0.4 ml.

The amount of UDP-[3H]galactose transported into the lumen of the vesicles (Si), the amount of [3H]galactose transferred into 70% ethanol-insoluble acceptors (TPs) and to acceptors at the organic phase plus the aqueous/organic interface (TP+L) are shown.

The results shown above, suggest that UDP-galactose transporters are present in the plant Golgi apparatus. Thus, to identify plant genes encoding for a putative UDP-galactose transporter we searched the A. thaliana data base for sequences similar to UDP-galactose transporter genes already described in animal cells and yeast (3Miura N.

When we began this work theArabidopsis genome was not completely sequenced and at that time, using the TBLASTN algorithm, we identified a gene (currently annotated as At2g02810) that showed high sequence similarity (54% similarity at the protein level) to the human UDP-galactose transporter-related l gene (hUGTrel1) (24Ishida N. Miura N. Yoshioka S. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subsequently, when theArabidopsis genome was completely sequenced, we found other sequences (shown below) that have similarity to UDP-galactose transporter genes; however, the first gene identified remained the most similar to hUGTrel1. We named this gene AtUTr1 forArabidopsisthalianaUDP-galactoseTransporter 1 (Fig.3A). The predicted protein has an estimated molecular mass of 36,942 daltons, and hydropathy analyses predict eight putative transmembrane domains. Interestingly, comparison of the hydrophobicity plots of the AtUTr1 and hUGTrel1 proteins showed that they are highly similar (Fig. 3B). To confirm that AtUTr1 is indeed expressed inArabidopsis we performed Northern analysis using total RNA and poly(A)+ RNA obtained from 2-week-old seedlings. A single band of 1.58 kb was detected in all cases (Fig.4). To test the ability of AtUTr1 to transport UDP-gal, we cloned AtUTr1 in the pcDNA3-Myc mammalian expression vector and then we stably transfected it in the mutant cell line MDCK-RCAr. The primary defect observed in this mutant is impaired transport of UDP-galactose into the Golgi apparatus, which results in reduced availability of UDP-galactose for the luminal galactosyltransferases. This mutant cell line tolerates a 10× higher concentration of the lectin ricin (RCA) than do wild type cells (8Brandli A. Hansson G. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Meiss H.K. Green R.F. Rodriguez-Boulan E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Ricin has a cytotoxic effect that depends on the binding to galactosyl residues and the ricin-resistant phenotype of the mutant correlates with a pleitropic deficiency in galactosylation of glycoproteins and sphingolipids. Transfection with AtUTr1 resulted in changes in the morphology and rate of growth of the transfectant, resembling the wild type cells instead of the mutant (not shown). Addition of ricin at 0.1 μg/ml for 7 days had toxic effects both on the mutants transfected with AtUTr1 and the wild type cells (Fig.5); however, this concentration of ricin showed no visible toxicity on the non-transfected mutant nor the mutant transfected with the vector alone. These results suggest that expression of AtUTr1 in MDCK-RCAr cells restores galactose addition into glycoconjugates by complementing the deficiency of transport of UDP-galactose into the Golgi. To confirm that AtUTr1 encodes for a nucleotide sugar transporter and also to study the specificity of the transporter, we expressed a MycHis epitope-tagged version of the protein in the yeast S. cerevisiae, an organism that has been used for the heterologous expression and functional analysis of other nucleotide sugar transporters genes such as the CMP-sialic acid and UDP-galactose transporters (12Sun-Wada G-H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12616-12619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using antibodies against the Myc epitope showed that the microsomal fraction obtained from yeast transformed with an expression vector containing AtUTr1-MycHis expressed a protein of 32 kDa (Fig.6). This molecular mass was lower than the expected molecular mass predicted from the primary sequence of the protein plus the MycHis epitope (41 kDa). However, a difference between the predicted molecular mass and the apparent one was also found in other cases of heterologous expression of nucleotide sugar transporters in yeast (25Berninsone P.

This change, which is unique among known HLA-B27 subtypes, was reported to restrict peptide binding specificity to ligands with C-terminal nonpolar residues (10Fiorillo M.T. Meadows L. D'Amato M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Apella E. Sorrentino R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This is in contrast with B*2705, which binds peptides with C-terminal basic, aliphatic, and aromatic residues (11Jardetzky T.S. Lane W.S. Robinson R.A. Madden D.R. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Previous studies did not address the effects of B*2709 polymorphism on other anchor positions of natural ligands or, more importantly, the overall effect of altered binding specificity on the constitutive peptide repertoire. In the present study we carried out a systematic comparison of the B*2705- and B*2709-bound peptide repertoires to determine the percentage of natural ligands shared by both allotypes. In addition, we sequenced a large number of peptides either common to both subtypes or selectively presented by one of them, to identify the structural features determining differential binding to both subtypes. Finally, we compared the expression of β2-microglobulin-free B*2705 and B*2709 heavy chains to test whether differential peptide binding might result in altered cell surface stability HLA B*2709 genomic DNA was obtained from a B*2705 genomic construct (12Calvo V. Rojo S. Lopez D. Galocha B. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4038-4045PubMed Google Scholar), substituting theXcmI-BssHII fragment (nucleotides 360–610) by the same fragment containing the 418G → C mutation (resulting in the D116H) obtained from a cDNA coding for B*2709 (a kind gift from R. Sorrentino). The resulting genomic construct was thoroughly sequenced to ensure that it contained only the desired mutation. HMy2.C1R (C1R) is a human lymphoid cell line with low expression of its endogenous class I antigens (13Storkus W.J. Howell D.N. Salter R.D. Dawson J.R. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1657-1659PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zemmour J. Little A.M. Schendel D.J. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1941-1948PubMed Google Scholar). B*2705-C1R transfectant cells were described elsewhere (12Calvo V. Rojo S. Lopez D. Galocha B. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4038-4045PubMed Google Scholar). The B*2709-C1R transfectant cell line was made as described (12Calvo V. Rojo S. Lopez D. Galocha B. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4038-4045PubMed Google Scholar) using the B*2709 gene. For some experiments a C1R cell line transfected with B*2709 cDNA was also used (15Garcia-Peydro M. Marti M. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2299-2305PubMed Google Scholar). C1R cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum or, for flow cytometry, in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (all from Invitrogen). RMA-S is a TAP-deficient murine cell line (16Ljunggren H.G. Karre K. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1745-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 17Townsend A. Ohlen C. Bastin J. Ljunggren H.G. Foster L. Karre K. Nature. 1989; 340: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). RMA-S transfectant cells expressing B*2705 and human β2-microglobulin have been previously described (18Villadangos J.A. Galocha B. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2317-2323PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The mAbs used in this study were W6/32 (IgG2a, specific for a monomorphic HLA-A, B, C determinant) (19Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. Brown G. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams A.F. Ziegler A. Cell. 1978; 14: 9-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar), ME1 (IgG1, specific for HLA-B27, B7, Bw22) (20Ellis S.A. Taylor C. McMichael A. Hum. Immunol. 1982; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), BBM.1 (IgG2b, specific for human β2-microglobulin) (21Brodsky F.M. Bodmer W.F. Parham P. Eur. J.

Chem. 1983; 258: 6179-6186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and HC10 (IgG2a, specific for denatured and other forms of HLA class I heavy chain not associated to β2-microglobulin) (23Stam N.J. Spits H. Ploegh H.L. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2299-2306PubMed Google Scholar). About 6 × 104untransfected, B*2705- or B*2709-C1R transfectant cells were washed twice in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 50 μl of undiluted mAb supernatant. After incubating for 30 min, cells were washed two times in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 50 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG rabbit antiserum (Calbiochem-Novabiochem GMBH, Schwalbach, Germany), incubated for 30 min, and washed two times in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. All operations were done at 4 °C. Flow cytometry was carried out in an Epics Profile XL instrument (Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialeah, FL). Isolation of HLA-B27-bound peptides from about 1010 HLA-B27 transfectant C1R cells was carried out as previously described (24Paradela A. Garcia-Peydro M. Vazquez J. Rognan D. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5481-5490PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, cell lysates were subjected to affinity chromatography using the W6/32 mAb. HLA-B27-bound peptides were eluted with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature, filtered trough Centricon 3 (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and concentrated for HPLC fractionation. This was conducted in a Waters Alliance system (Waters, Milford, MA) using a Vydac 218TP52 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) at a flow rate of 100 μl/min, exactly as described (25Paradela A. Alvarez I. Garcia-Peydro M. Sesma L. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fractions of 50 μl were collected. The peptide composition of HPLC fractions was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS using a calibrated Kompact Probe instrument (Kratos-Schimadzu) operating in the positive linear mode, as previously described (25Paradela A. Alvarez I. Garcia-Peydro M. Sesma L. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Dried fractions were resuspended in 5 μl of methanol/water (1:1) containing 0.1% formic acid, and 0.5-μl aliquots of the sample were deposited onto the stainless steel MALDI probe and allowed to dry at room temperature. Then 0.5 μl of matrix solution (saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 33% aqueous acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was added and again allowed to dry at room temperature. Peptide sequencing was carried out by quadrupole ion trap nanoelectrospray MS/MS in an LCQ instrument (Finnigan ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA), exactly as detailed elsewhere (26Yague J. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1998; 52: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Marina A. Garcia M.A. Albar J.P. Yague J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Vazquez J. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One peptide was sequenced by MALDI-TOF/TOF using the Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyser with TOF/TOFTM optics. The corresponding HPLC fraction was dried and redissolved in methanol/formic acid/water as above. A 1-μl aliquot was mixed with 1 μl of matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid: 2.5 mg/ml in acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water, 1:1). Full scan MS was carried out by MALDI-TOF, and the selected ion peak was subjected to MS/MS. Assignment of the isobaric Ile/Leu or Lys/Gln residues was done on the basis of unambiguous matching with known sequences in the data base. In one case (TRIPKIQKL), assignment of Lys8 was not possible by this procedure, and the residue was assigned on the basis of identity of retention time in HPLC of the corresponding synthetic peptide, but not of the peptide with Gln8, with the natural ligand. These were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, and purified by HPLC. The correct molecular mass of purified peptides was established by MALDI-TOF MS, and their correct composition and quantification was done by amino acid analysis after hydrolysis in 6m HCL using a 6300 Amino Acid Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA). The epitope stabilization assay used to measure peptide binding was performed as described (28Galocha B. Lamas J.R. Villadangos J.A. Albar J.P. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, B*2705 RMA-S transfectants were incubated at 26 °C for 22 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. These were then washed three times in AIM-V serum-free medium (Invitrogen), incubated for 1 h at 26 °C with various peptide concentrations in the same medium, transferred to 37 °C, and collected for flow cytometry after 4 h. HLA-B27 expression was measured using 50 μl of hybridoma culture supernatant containing the mAb ME1. Binding of the RRYQKSTEL peptide, used as positive control, was expressed as C50, which is the molar concentration of the peptide at 50% of the maximum fluorescence obtained at the concentration range 100–0.01 μm. Binding of other peptides was assessed as the concentration of peptide required to obtain the fluorescence value at the C50 of the control peptide. This was designated as EC50. The B*2705- and B*2709-bound peptide pools were isolated from the corresponding C1R transfectant cells after immunoprecipitation of HLA-B27 and acid extraction. The peptide pools were fractionated by HPLC under identical conditions, and the peptide composition of individual fractions was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The spectrum of each HPLC fraction from one subtype was compared with the correlative, previous and following fractions from the other subtype. In this comparison only ion peaks showing 5% or more of the maximum intensity in the corresponding HPLC fraction of at least one subtype were taken into account. Ion peaks with the same (± 1) mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and retention times were assigned as identical ligands in both subtypes. Although because of the complexity of the peptide mixture analyzed this is not always the case, it is reasonable to assume that the overwhelming majority of peptides with the same molecular mass and retention time from these peptide pools are identical. This was confirmed by sequencing such peptides from both subtypes in multiple instances. Ion peaks detected from only one subtype in two independent preparations were assigned as peptides differentially bound to that subtype. In a number of cases a prominent ion peak in one subtype had a much smaller counterpart in the other subtype. In all these cases the peptides were assigned as shared ligands. When the prominent ion peak showed >50% of the maximal intensity in the MALDI-TOF MS spectrum, and the intensity of its counterpart in the other subtype was at least 10-fold lower in two independent preparations, the corresponding peptide was assigned as a quantitative difference. This type of assignment must be considered with caution because the ion intensity of a given peptide in complex mixtures may have significant variations and is not an accurate indication of peptide amount. However, with the conservative criteria adopted concerning signal intensity differences and reproducibility we attempted to compensate in part for this limitation. A total of 1221 and 1094 molecular species were compared from the B*2705- and B*2709-bound peptide pools, respectively (TableI). Of these, 965 ion peaks were detected in both subtypes, 256 only in B*2705, and 129 only in B*2709. Thus, the B*2705-bound peptide pool includes 21% of peptides not found in B*2709. Conversely, the B*2709-bound peptide pool includes about 12% of peptides absent from B*2705. The mean molecular mass of B*2705 and B*2709 ligands was very similar, although peptides differentially bound to B*2705 had a mean molecular mass 24 Da higher (Fig.1). Within the shared ligands 143 and 165 ion peaks from B*2705 or B*2709, respectively, showed sufficient intensity to fulfill the criteria for assessing quantitative differences. Of these, 15 molecular species (10%) were assigned as quantitative differences predominant in B*2705, and 27 (16%) predominant in B*2709.Table IComparison of B*2705- and B*2709-bound peptide repertoiresB*2705 ligandsB*2709 ligandsTotalSharedSpecificTotalSharedSpecific1221965 (79%)256 (21%)1094965 (88%)129 (12%)Quantitative differences between B*2705 and B*2709In B*2705In B*2709Predominant/counted (%)15/143 (10)27/165 (16) Open table in a new tab These results indicate that the single amino acid change distinguishing B*2709 from B*2705 allows binding of 79% of the natural B*2705-bound ligands, abrogates binding of the remaining 21%, and substantially decreases the amount of bound peptide of at least 10% of shared ligands. Moreover, B*2709 polymorphism confers to this subtype distinct binding capacity, so that 12% of the peptide repertoire from this subtype is absent from B*2705, and at least 16% of shared ligands are significantly more abundant in B*2709. A total of 64 peptides were sequenced, mainly by nanoelectrospray MS/MS, from the B*2705- and/or B*2709-bound peptide pools. They included 32 shared ligands, of which 7 were quantitative differences predominant in B*2705 (2Lopez-Larrea C. Sujirachato K. Mehra N.K. Chiewsilp P. Isarangkura D. Kanga U. Dominguez O. Coto E. Peña M. Setien F. Gonzalez-Roces S. Tissue Antigens. 1995; 45: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) or B*2709 (5D'Amato M. Fiorillo M.T. Carcassi C. Mathieu A. Zuccarelli A. Bitti P.P. Tosi R. Sorrentino R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3199-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), 23 ligands found only in B*2705, and 9 ligands found only in B*2709 (Fig.2). All the peptides found only in B*2705 had C-terminal basic (Arg, Lys) or Tyr residues, whereas shared ligands, except quantitative differences, had C-terminal nonpolar residues, including aliphatic ones (Ala, Leu, Val, Met) or Phe. These results confirm previous studies (10Fiorillo M.T. Meadows L. D'Amato M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Apella E. Sorrentino R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) showing that B*2709 polymorphism restricts binding to peptides with C-terminal hydrophobic residues. In addition, two novel findings arise from our results. First, this restriction was not absolute because two peptides with C-terminal Tyr and Arg, respectively, were found as natural ligands of B*2709, albeit in much lower amount than in B*2705. The identity of the peptide with a C-terminal Tyr in B*2709 was formally confirmed by MS/MS sequencing (Fig. 2). Second, a number of peptides with C-terminal aliphatic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Cys) were found only or predominantly in B*2709, indicating that, although these residues are also favored in B*2705, some such peptides do not bind or bind inefficiently to this subtype in vivo. However, no obvious differential usage of particular residues was observed at positions other than the C-terminal one between peptides found only or predominantly in B*2705, and those differentially bound to B*2709. To confirm that B*2709 ligands not found in B*2705 were indeed poor binders to this allotype, three such peptides were tested for binding to B*2705 in an epitope stabilization assay using RMA-S transfectant cells (Fig. 3). All B*2709 ligands tested bound B*2705 with moderate efficiency (EC50 ≥ 17 μm) and significantly more weakly than a B*2705 ligand used as positive control (C50, 3 μm). These results explain that, despite having major anchor residues suitable for B*2705, some B*2709 ligands are not found in B*2705. We tested the possibility that alterations in the nature and affinity of the constitutive peptide repertoire induced by B*2709 polymorphism might change the expression level of free HLA-B27 heavy chain on the cell surface, as recently observed with the C67S mutation on B*2705 (29Alvarez I.

Thus, HLA-B27 expression was analyzed on B*2705- and B*2709-C1R transfectant cells by flow cytometry with mAbs ME1, W6/32, and BBM.1, all reacting with the native molecule and with HC10, which reacts with β2-microglobulin-free HLA class I heavy chains. With all mAbs the surface expression of either native or β2-microglobulin-free B*2705 and B*2709 molecules was very similar (Fig. 4). The ratio of ME1- to HC10-associated fluorescence was about 18: 1 and 21:1 for B*2705 and B*2709, respectively (Table II), suggesting that about 5% of the molecules of each subtype were expressed at the cell surface as β2-microglobulin-free heavy chains.Table IIExpression of B*2705 and B*2709 on the surface of C1R transfectant cellsmAbMean fluorescence ± S.D.C1RB*2705-C1RB*2709-C1RME10.6 ± 0.132.3 ± 8.540.3 ± 8.6W6/327.2 ± 2.648.7 ± 19.248.1 ± 21.6BBM.111.8 ± 7.555.2 ± 14.057.6 ± 16.0HC101.3 ± 0.43.1 ± 0.93.2 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab The HLA-B27 prototype, B*2705, binds with few exceptions (29Alvarez I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48740-48747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) peptides with an Arg2 and C-terminal basic, aliphatic, or aromatic residues (11Jardetzky T.S. Lane W.S. Robinson R.A. Madden D.R. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Whereas Arg2 is a major motif shared with other HLA-B27 subtypes, these differ among each other in the nature of accepted C-terminal residues. Because B*2702, which like B*2705 is associated to AS presents only peptides with C-terminal aliphatic or aromatic residues (30Rotzschke O. Falk K. Stevanovic S. Gnau V. Jung G. Rammensee H.G. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it was suggested that HLA-B27 ligands with C-terminal basic residues may not be relevant for susceptibility to AS. The initial reports that B*2706 and B*2709 did not bind peptides with C-terminal Tyr, a residue that is accepted by disease-associated subtypes B*2705, B*2702, and B*2704, suggested that putative arthritogenic peptides might carry this motif (10Fiorillo M.T. Meadows L. D'Amato M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Apella E. Sorrentino R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Garcia F. Marina A. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This view was challenged by the finding that the AS-associated subtype B*2707 failed to show a C-terminal Tyr motif upon pool sequencing (32Tieng V. Dulphy N. Boisgérault F. Tamouza R. Charron D. Toubert A. Immunogenetics. 1997; 47: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Failure to bind peptides with C-terminal Tyr was recently confirmed for B*2706 (33Sesma L. Montserrat V. Lamas J.R. Marina A. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16744-16749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and, in the present study, for B*2709, but several novel aspects were revealed by our results now. First, although B*2709 specificity is highly restricted to peptides with C-terminal aliphatic or Phe residues two peptides with C-terminal Arg and Tyr, respectively, were found in the B*2709-bound peptide pool. Although both peptides were much more abundant in B*2705 their amount in B*2709 could be immunologically significant because our MS techniques were less sensitive than CTL, which are known to recognize minimal amounts of peptides presented at the cell surface. Thus, exclusion of peptides with C-terminal basic or Tyr residues by B*2709 is not absolute. Second, some B*2709 ligands with C-terminal aliphatic residues were not found in B*2705 and bound this subtype in vitro with moderate efficiency although B*2705 accepts peptides with these motifs. Because there was no obvious differential features arising from the sequences of B*2709-specific ligands, selective binding of some peptides with C-terminal nonpolar residues to B*2709 may be because of a combination of suboptimal motifs at multiple secondary anchor positions. This would be compatible with binding only if compensated by stronger anchoring of the C-terminal nonpolar residue in the more hydrophobic F pocket of B*2709. Thus, B*2709 polymorphism might indirectly modulate residue usage at secondary anchor positions, although this effect would be less drastic than the effect on C-terminal residue usage, and its precise characterization might require very high numbers of individual peptide sequences. Third, the ratio between cell surface-expressed HLA-B27/peptide complexes and β2-microglobulin-free heavy chains was the same for both subtypes. We have previously shown (29Alvarez I. Martı́ M. Vazquez J. Camafeita E. Ogueta S. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48740-48747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that modification of this ratio toward increasing the latter species in an HLA-B27 mutant correlated with lower overall affinity for the mutant-bound peptide repertoire. Thus, our results suggest that B*2705 and B*2709 do not differ in the average stability of the B27/peptide complexes expressed at the cell surface. A main issue addressed in this study was to what extent the restrictions in C-terminal residue usage imposed by B*2709 polymorphism altered the peptide repertoire, relative to B*2705. All sequenced B*2705-ligands not found in B*2709 had C-terminal Arg, Lys, or Tyr, indicating that the subset of B*2705-bound peptides with these C-terminal residues is largely absent from B*2709. In our analysis B*2705 shared about 79% of its peptide repertoire with B*2709. This figure is fully consistent with the degree of cross-reaction of alloreactive B*2705-specific CTL with B*2709, reported previously (15Garcia-Peydro M. Marti M. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2299-2305PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that many shared ligands adopt similar conformation and antigenic features when bound to both subtypes. The relevance of our results for the pathogenetic role of HLA-B27 in Spa is obviously dependent on the extent to which B*2709 may determine susceptibility for this group of diseases. Because this subtype has been found with significant frequency only in Sardinia, the strongest evidence against involvement of this allotype in AS comes from the absence of B*2709 AS patients in this population (5D'Amato M. Fiorillo M.T. Carcassi C. Mathieu A. Zuccarelli A. Bitti P.P. Tosi R. Sorrentino R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3199-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). That none of the four reported B*2709 individuals with Spa in continental Italy showed typical AS or axial pathology, except for sacroiliitis in one case (7Olivieri I. Ciancio G. Padula A. Gaudiano C. Masciandaro S. Moro L. Durante E. Pozzi S. Ferrara G.B. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 553-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), strongly supports that B*2709 is weakly or not associated with AS but also suggests that this subtype may influence susceptibility to related forms of arthritis. Without excluding alternative mechanisms (34Allen R.L. Bowness P. McMichael A. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Edwards J.C. Bowness P. Archer J.R. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 256-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 36Colbert R.A. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), our results are compatible with involvement of some peptide(s) belonging to a limited set of the B*2705-bound repertoire in the pathogenesis of AS, as proposed by the arthritogenic peptide hypothesis (37Benjamin R. Parham P. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Because peptides with C-terminal basic residues are not bound to B*2702, our results suggest, in agreement with previous studies (10Fiorillo M.T. Meadows L. D'Amato M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Apella E. Sorrentino R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Garcia F. Marina A. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Sesma L. Montserrat V. Lamas J.R. Marina A. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16744-16749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), that putative AS-related peptide(s) might have C-terminal Tyr. The capacity of B*2709 to bind low amounts of some peptides with this motif might explain the apparent relationship of this subtype with undifferentiated Spa. The apparent contradiction that the AS-associated B*2707 subtype does not bind peptides with C-terminal Tyr, based on sequencing by Edman degradation (32Tieng V. Dulphy N. Boisgérault F. Tamouza R. Charron D. Toubert A. Immunogenetics. 1997; 47: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) might require reassessment using the much more sensitive MS sequencing, to determine whether such peptides might bind B*2707 in small amounts as found here for B*2709. There is an alternative interpretation to the relationship between the B*2705- and B*2709-bound peptide repertoires and the differential association of these subtypes to AS. It is conceivable that a putative arthritogenic peptide might actually bind better to a subtype not associated to AS than to a disease-associated subtype, because thymic deletion of autoreactive T-cells against such peptide would be favored for the subtype capable to present it more efficiently. For B*2705 and B*2709, this possibility was suggested by a previous study showing that a synthetic peptide derived from a self-protein that elicited CTL responses in B*2705-positive AS patients better than on healthy individuals actually bound better B*2709 than B*2705 (38Fiorillo M.T. Maragno M. Butler R. Dupuis M.L. Sorrentino R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). According to this view, putative arthritogenic peptides should be among those with C-terminal nonpolar residues that are selectively or predominantly presented by B*2709, such as those found in this study. Discerning between both alternatives requires further research, but our results may help to focus on the limited subsets of HLA-B27-bound peptides that are not overlapping among subtypes differentially associated to AS.

https://openalex.org/W2075355281,"In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel Krüppel-like protein named Gli-similar 1 (Glis1). The Glis1 gene encodes an 84.3-kDa proline-rich protein. Its five tandem zinc finger motifs exhibit highest homology with those of members of the Gli and Zic subfamilies of Krüppel-like proteins. Glis1 was mapped to mouse chromosome 4C6. Northern blot analysis showed that expression of the 3.3-kb Glis1 mRNA is most abundant in placenta and adult kidney and expressed at lower levels in testis. Whole mount in situhybridization on mouse embryos demonstrated that Glis1 is expressed in a temporal and spatial manner during development; expression was most prominent in several defined structures of mesodermal lineage, including craniofacial regions, branchial arches, somites, vibrissal and hair follicles, limb buds, and myotomes. Confocal microscopic analysis showed that Glis1 is localized to the nucleus. The zinc finger region plays an important role in the nuclear localization of Glis1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that Glis1 is able to bind oligonucleotides containing the Gli-binding site consensus sequence GACCACCCAC. Although monohybrid analysis showed that in several cell types Glis1 was unable to induce transcription of a reporter, deletion mutant analysis revealed the presence of a strong activation function at the carboxyl terminus of Glis1. The activation through this activation function was totally suppressed by a repressor domain at its amino terminus. Constitutively active Ca2+-dependent calmodulin kinase IV enhanced Glis1-mediated transcriptional activation about 4-fold and may be mediated by phosphorylation/activation of a co-activator. Our results suggest that Glis1 may play a critical role in the control of gene expression during specific stages of embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2027035820,"In eukaryotes, the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint provides a monitor for the fidelity of chromosomal segregation. In this context, the mitotic arrest deficiency protein 2 (MAD2) censors chromosomal mis-segregation by monitoring microtubule attachment/tension, a role that requires its attachment to kinetochores. Studies in yeast have shown that binding of MAD1 to MAD2 is important for the checkpoint function of the latter. The interactions between human MAD1 (hsMAD1) and human MAD2 (hsMAD2) have, however, remained poorly characterized. Here we report that two leucine zipper domains (amino acids 501–522 and 557–571) in hsMAD1 are required for its contact with hsMAD2. Interestingly, in several cancer cell lines, we noted the frequent presence of a coding single nucleotide Arg to His polymorphism at codon 558 located within the second leucine zipper of hsMAD1. We found that hsMAD1H558 is less proficient than hsMAD1R558 in binding hsMAD2 and in enforcing mitotic arrest. We also document a first example of loss-of-heterozygosity for a spindle checkpoint gene (at the hsMAD1 558 locus) in a human breast cancer.

If spindle damage or segregation mistakes happen, a mitotic metaphase-to-anaphase checkpoint that halts propagation of error is activated (1Amon A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 2Wassmann K. Benezra R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Accordingly, cells arrest in metaphase until corrections are achieved and impartial allocation of chromosomes can be ensured. Loss of spindle checkpoint is one of several processes that could result in aneuploidy. Because deviation from euploidy is seen in 70–80% of all types of human cancers (3Heim S. Mitelman F. Cancer Cytogenesis. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1995: 1-17Google Scholar), aneuploidy could be an important contributor to transformation. Genetics studies in yeast and mammals have implicated at least 7 genes (4Li R. Murray A.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 519-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 5Hoyt M.A. Totis L.

Although details of how this complex works remain to be fully understood, it is generally agreed that the distal effector protein of the metaphase-anaphase checkpoint is MAD2, which has been found to bind CDC20 and to inhibit the function of the anaphase-promoting complex (8Li Y. Gorbea C. Mahaffey D. Rechsteiner M. Benezra R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12431-12436Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 9Elledge S.J.

The high frequency of aneuploidy in cancers has prompted the thought that loss-of-function mutations in human BUB/MAD proteins might occur rather commonly. Intriguingly, empirical data have largely been incongruent with this hypothesis (11Tighe A. Johnson V.L. Albertella M. Taylor S.S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Indeed, in a survey of 21 lung cancer cell lines and 25 primary lung cancers, Takahashi et al. (12Takahashi T. Haruki N. Nomoto S. Masuda A. Saji S. Osada H. Takahashi T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4295-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) concluded there was a lack of any obviously inactivating mutation in hsMAD2. Similarly, Cahill et al. (13Cahill D.P. Lengauer C., Yu, J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K.V. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar) found only limited changes in BUB1 from a series of 19 colorectal cancers (i.e. two total changes, a single missense mutation, and a 197-bp internal deletion). Currently a definition of simple recessive mutation(s) that prevalently explains aneuploidy remains elusive. Mechanistically, binding of the spindle effector protein, hsMAD2, to kinetochores is a critical step in mitotic checkpoint function. During mitosis, unattached kinetochores attract MAD2 to produce a diffusible “wait anaphase” signal (14Shah J.V. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 997-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 15Howell B.J. Hoffman D.B. Fang G. Murray A.W. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1233-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) which is then silenced by spindle attachment. We previously identified and cloned an intracellular binding partner of hsMAD2, human MAD1 (16Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), whose intracellular biological activity remains largely uncharacterized. Earlier it was thought that oligomerized hsMAD2 was wholly sufficient to produce cell cycle arrest; however, recent data (17Sironi L. Melixetian M. Faretta M. Prosperini E. Helin K. Musacchio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6371-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) suggest that binding of hsMAD2 to hsMAD1 rather than oligomerization is the critical step required for spindle checkpoint function. Because Mad2 mutations in aneuploid tumors are exceedingly rare (12Takahashi T. Haruki N. Nomoto S. Masuda A. Saji S. Osada H. Takahashi T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4295-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Cahill D.P. da Costa L.T. Carson-Walter E.B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C.

Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000; 29: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and because binding of MAD2 to MAD1 is required for checkpoint function (17Sironi L. Melixetian M. Faretta M. Prosperini E. Helin K. Musacchio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6371-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we wondered whether frequent loss of MAD2-associated wait anaphase function might be because of changes in its binding protein, MAD1. Here we show that human MAD1 dominantly dictates MAD2 migration into kinetochore-proximal nuclear punctates through a process that requires MAD1-MAD2 binding. We also show that binding of full-length MAD2 by full MAD1 requires two leucine zipper domains (amino acids 501–522 and 557–571) in hsMAD1. One of these two leucine zipper domains is disrupted by an Arg-558 to His-coding single nucleotide polymorphism in mad1 allele frequently found in many human cancer cell lines. HeLa and Hct116 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high glucose supplemented with antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin-G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) and 10% fetal bovine serum. hsMAD1 expression vector was constructed by in-frame insertion of full-length MAD1 open reading frames with either 558R or 558H codon into pcDNA4HisMax vector (Invitrogen). Deletions in hsMAD1 and hsMAD2 were by PCR-based mutagenesis. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Fragments were inserted in-frame into pEGFP-C1 or pDs-Red-C1 vector (CLONTECH). Transient transfection of HeLa and Hct116 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequence information of hsMAD1 is based on NM003550 in which we corrected a 1-nucleotide-insertion sequencing error by us previously reported under GenBankTM accession number U33822. PCR amplification for hsMAD1 cDNA or genomic DNA was performed with GC-RICH PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The entire coding sequences of hsMAD1 were amplified from tumor cDNA libraries (matched cDNA pairs from tumor and normal tissues: CLONTECH) and cDNA generated by cells to cDNA (Ambion) from cancer cell lines, using the following primers 5′-ATATATGAATTCCATGGAAGACCTGGGGGAAAACACC-3′ and 5′-AAATTTGGATCCGATTTTATTTCACAAGGTGAGGAAC-3′, digested withEcoRI and BamHI, and cloned into pUC vector for sequencing. hsMAD1 exon17 was amplified from genomic DNA using the following primers: 5′-GTGTGAGAATTCCTGCAGGGTGACTATGACCAG-3′ and 5′-GAGTCTGGATCCCTGCCACCTCCTTGGACGATGGCAGAC-3′. Where indicated, genomic PCR products were also digested withAccII for analysis. Asynchronous HeLa cells were fixed with methanol, stained with anti-hsMAD1 monospecific antibody and anti-kinetochore human serum ANA-C (Sigma), washed, and visualized by incubation with anti-mouse IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) and anti-human IgG TRITC (Sigma). HeLa cells transfected with GFP-hsMAD1 were fixed with methanol, stained with ANA-C, washed, and visualized by staining with anti-human IgG TRITC. Live HeLa cells transfected with GFP-hsMAD1, GFP-hsMAD2, or RFP-hsMAD2 were visualized by confocal microscopy Axiovert 135M (Carl Zeiss). HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA4/HisMax-558R or -558H were harvested 48 h after transfection. Cells were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 15 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Xpress (Invitrogen). Precipitates and whole cell lysates resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). hsMAD1 and hsMAD2 proteins were detected with anti-HisG (Invitrogen) or anti-hsMAD2 antibody (Transduction Laboratories), respectively. Blots were visualized by chemiluminescence (Tropix). Whole cell lysates of KG1 or LS411N cells resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE were transferred to membrane and detected with anti-hsMAD1 antibody. Cells were cotransfected with EGFP-C1 plasmid and pcDNA4HisMax-558R or -558H or control plasmid. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 0.2 μg/ml nocodazole. Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde and stained with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). To measure mitotic indices, at least 300 cells with green signal were counted per assay at the indicated times after nocodazole treatment. In Fig. 9, mitotic indices were measure in Hoechst 33258-stained cells without transfection. The rarity of Mad2 mutations in aneuploid human tumors led us to ask whether loss of hsMad2-dependent spindle checkpoint function might instead emanate from changes inhsMad1. To investigate this possibility, we surveyed human cancer cells for alterations in Mad1. We directly sequencedMad1 open reading frames from 17 solid tumors and 6 HTLV-1-transformed cells. From these 23 samples, several sporadic and inconsistent point changes in Mad1 were noted (Fig. 1a). However, one frequent (>50% occurrence) and consistent finding was a change in exon 17 of hsMad1. Here, a coding single nucleotide g to a polymorphism at codon 558 (Fig. 1b) replacing an Arg (arginine) with an His (histidine) was found in 9 of 17 solid tumors and 3 of 6 HTLV-transformed cells. Previously, Cahill and colleagues (13Cahill D.P. Lengauer C., Yu, J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K.V. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar) had raised the example that a single amino acid substitution in BUB1 was sufficient to alter mitotic spindle checkpoint. Thus, we considered whether the Arg to His substitution at codon 558 in hsMAD1 might also influence function. MAD1 has a long coiled-coil structure that is highly conserved inDrosophila, Xenopus, rodents, and primates. Residue 558 lies within a leucine zipper region that was suggested to be important for the protein-protein binding of hsMAD1 (20Chun A.C. Zhou Y. Wong C.M. Kung H.F. Jeang K.T. Jin D.Y. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Computer modeling implicates the Arg to His change at position 558 to produce a small but distinct perturbation in the coiled-coil of hsMAD1 (Fig. 2a). We wondered whether this might commensurately affect protein-protein binding between hsMAD1 and hsMAD2 (16Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) thereby disturbing MAD2-dependent function. We constructed two otherwise isogenic hsMAD1 expression vectors that respectively encoded for either MAD1R558 or MAD1H558. Both vectors were tagged identically at their N termini with consecutive HisG and Xpress epitopes (Fig. 2b). The two vectors were separately introduced into cells. Transfected cells were found to express equally the two exogenously introduced MAD1 proteins (Fig. 2b, lanes 3 and 4, anti-HisG) as well as to have equal amounts of cell endogenous MAD2 protein (Fig. 2b, lanes 3 and 4, anti-MAD2). We then immunoprecipitated whole cell lysates with anti-Xpress (Fig. 2b, lanes 1and 2), and we measured the amount of immunoprecipitated Xpress-tagged MAD1 and co-precipitated MAD2 by Western blotting with anti-HisG (Fig. 2b, lanes 1 and 2, top) and anti-MAD2 (Fig. 2b, lanes 1 and 2, bottom), respectively. Normalizing for recoveries, we found that consistent with the predicted disturbance in coiled-coil sequence MAD1H558 was 4.5-fold worse than MAD1R558 in binding MAD2. We next asked whether the MAD1R558 to MAD1H558 change influences intracellular mitotic checkpoint. To address this, we transiently transfected spindle checkpoint intact Hct116 cells separately with vectors expressing either MAD1R558 or MAD1H558. The transfected cells were then challenged with microtubule-disrupting agent, nocodazole, to induce checkpoint activity. Competency of mitotic arrest was assessed. To minimize the potential for cellular adaptation and resulting mitotic slippage (21Meek D.W. Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 2000; 48: 246-254PubMed Google Scholar), mitotic indices were monitored within 6 h of exposure to nocodazole. In this rapid single round cell cycle measurement, we consistently found MAD1H558 to reduce the efficiency of nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest (Fig. 2c) by 8–10% when compared with MAD1R558. Because only a minority (∼25%; see pcDNA4 values, Fig. 2c) of these asynchronously cultured cells was poised to enter metaphase during the 6-h assay, if this effect were translated to a homogeneous population of metaphase-synchronized cells then single-round mitotic arrest differences between MAD1H558 versus MAD1R558 would range between 32 and 40%. Hct116 is a diploid human colon cancer that expresses large amounts of endogenous MAD1 protein (Fig.3a, lane 1). Because of its high level of MAD1, the true potency of exogenously introduced MAD1H558 could be partially masked in Hct116. We had previously mapped hsMad1 to human chromosome 7 (22Jin D.Y. Kozak C.A. Pangilinan F. Spencer F. Green E.D. Jeang K.T. Genomics. 1999; 55: 363-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because monosomy 7 (i.e. aMad1 haplotype) is rather common in several types of human cancers, we sought to verify whether in settings of reduced MAD1 expression (e.g. monosomy 7 cells) the mitotic arrest differences between MAD1H558 and MAD1R558 would be enhanced. In two cell lines KG-1 (Fig. 3a, lane 2), an acute myelogenous leukemia with monosomy 7, and LS411N (Fig.3a, lane 3), a human Dukes' type B cecum carcinoma with monosomy 7, were directly verified to have low amounts of endogenous MAD1. In these two cells, we repeated the comparison between MAD1R558 and MAD1H558. Consistent with expectation and with the above Hct116 results, we observed arrest efficiency differences of 30–40% between MAD1H558 and MAD1R558 (Fig. 3b). These results suggest that an hsMad1h558 genotype superimposed on an otherwise hsMad1 haplotype (i.e. monosomy 7) potentially conveys a worse cancer prognosis than an hsMad1haplotype alone. The above functional observations prompted us to consider how MAD1H558 might mechanistically influence intracellular spindle checkpoint function. Previously, in vitro results from Xenopus egg extracts have suggested that soluble Xmad1 might recruit Xmad2 to kinetochores (23Chen R.H. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, potential biological differences between meiotic Xenopus soluble egg extracts and mitotic human cells question whether convergent or divergent rules govern MAD1, MAD2, and kinetochore interaction in the latter setting (24Abrieu A. Kahana J.A. Wood K.W. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 2000; 102: 817-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). For example, whereas CENP-E is required in Xenopus egg extracts for Xmad2 attachment to and signaling from kinetochores (24Abrieu A. Kahana J.A. Wood K.W. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 2000; 102: 817-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), depletion of CENP-E in HeLa cells paradoxically conferred chronic hsMAD2 association to and signaling from human kinetochores (25Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Further confusing the understanding of MAD1/MAD2 activity in human cells, several different immunostained profiles of hsMAD1 during various stages of the cell cycle have been reported (16Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 26Campbell M.S. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 114: 953-963Google Scholar). To understand better the MAD1H558 phenotype, we created chimeric green fluorescent (GFP)-hsMAD1 to analyze protein localization as well as intracellular interactions between MAD1 and MAD2. Asynchronously cultured HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid vector expressing GFP-hsMAD1. Cells were then examined for green fluorescence and also immunostained with anti-kinetochore antibody, ANA-C (Fig. 4a). ANA-C stained the interphase nuclei to produce an array of small dots consistent with centromeres/pre-kinetochores (Fig. 4a, middle panel). The GFP-hsMAD1 protein also presented constitutively in the interphase nuclei as bright green, slightly larger, nuclear punctates (Fig. 4a, left), some of which overlaid proximally with a subset of ANA-C stained dots (Fig.4a, right). The fact that GFP-hsMAD1 appeared constitutively in the nucleus prompted us to query as to how in human cells MAD1 might interact with MAD2. An initial report (27O'Neill T.J. Zhu Y. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10035-10040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) on MAD2 had found it to be largely cytoplasmic in mammalian cells. In detergent fractionation of several types of human cells, we obtained results in agreement with this cytoplasmic predominance (data not shown). Because MSC checkpoint function obliges MAD2 to localize to kinetochores, one wonders whether this protein diffuses to kinetochores purely after mitotic dissolution of the nuclear envelope or whether some active fraction of human MAD2 might be in a centromere-proximal nuclear locale prior to mitosis. To address this question in the context of GFP-hsMAD1, we constructed a red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged hsMAD2 protein (Fig.4b). Asynchronous HeLa cells were then transfected with GFP-hsMAD1-alone (Fig. 4b, left column), RFP-hsMAD2-alone (Fig. 4b, middle column), or RFP-hsMAD2 + GFP-hsMAD1 together (Fig. 4b, right column). Green (488 nm) and red (568 nm) signals independently captured from the same cells permitted one to distinguish MAD1 from MAD2. GFP-MAD1-alone was found to be nuclear and in punctated configurations (Fig.4b, left column); by contrast, RFP-hsMAD2-alone was faintly whole cell to largely cytoplasmic (Fig.4b, middle column). This profile agrees with a previously mentioned whole cell pattern for GFP-yMAD2 in yeast (28Chen R.H. Brady D.M. Smith D. Murray A.W. Hardwick K.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2607-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and suggests that in the pre-mitotic phase of the cell cycle MAD2 autonomously is incapable of specific nuclear localization. Interestingly, when GFP-MAD1 and RFP-MAD2 were simultaneously expressed in the same cell, RFP-MAD2 was quantitatively driven into GFP-MAD1 nuclear dots (Fig. 4b, right column). In these interphase cells, the GFP-hsMAD1 + RFP-hsMAD2-dots were indistinguishable from those of GFP-MAD1-alone (Fig. 3b, left column). This finding suggests that in human cells some portion of MAD2 can be actively localized into the nucleus by hsMAD1 prior to the dissolution of the nuclear envelope. hsMAD1 is a 718-amino acid polypeptide with an extended coiled-coil (aa 48–631). It has a putative nuclear localization signal (aa 381–400) and two leucine zippers at aa 501–522 and aa 557–571 (Fig. 5a). We constructed eight deleted forms of GFP-hsMAD1 in order to further understand its determinants of subcellular localization (Fig. 5a). The eight GFP-hsMAD1 mutants included those progressively removed for C-terminal sequences (i.e. ΔC1–ΔC4), those progressively deleted for N-terminal sequences (i.e.ΔN1–ΔN3), and one containing the central 324–498 residues (m4). Each mutant was separately transfected into cells, and the cells were imaged by laser confocal microscopy. Among the eight forms of MAD1, only GFP-wild type MAD1 (Fig. 5b, panel 1) and GFP-MAD1ΔC1 (Fig. 5, panel 2) presented nuclear dots. GFP-MAD1ΔC2 and GFP-MAD1ΔC3, although not exhibiting a punctate pattern, appeared in the nucleus (Fig. 5b, panels 3 and 4). By contrast, GFP-MAD1ΔC4 and GFP-MAD1ΔN2 were nuclear-excluded (Fig. 5b, panels 5 and 7). Finally, GFP-MAD1ΔN1, GFP-MADΔN3, and GFP-MAD1m4 were found in both nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 5b, panels 6, 8, and 9). Collectively, these profiles suggest an intact leucine zipper at amino acids 557–571 (Fig.5a) as being required for presentation of nuclear punctates and the 381–400 nuclear localization signal as being a necessary element for nuclear localization. To further detail human MAD1-MAD2 interactions, we next expressed RFP-hsMAD2 with various GFP-tagged hsMAD1 mutants (Fig. 5a). En toto, seven hsMAD1 mutants were analyzed (Fig. 6, a–g). Among the mutants, only GFP-hsMAD1ΔC1 (Fig.6a) could relocalize RFP-hsMAD2 into nuclear dots. Interestingly, although neither GFP-hsMAD1ΔN1 (Fig. 6e) nor GFP-hsMAD1ΔN2 (Fig. 6f) produced nuclear punctates, both mutants did reorganize the stained morphology of RFP-hsMAD2. Thus these two MAD1 mutants, although aberrant unto themselves, appear to remain competent for intracellular contact with RFP-hsMAD2. Based on the confocal images, we concluded that all MAD1 forms that affected MAD2 patterning (e.g. wild type GFP-hsMAD1, GFP-hsMAD1ΔC1, GFP-hsMAD1ΔN1, and GFP-hsMAD1ΔN2) maintained intact aa 501–522 and 557–571 leucine zippers. On the other hand, MAD1 forms that did not influence intracellular MAD2 staining (e.g. GFP-MAD1ΔC2; GFP-MAD1ΔC3, GFP-MAD1ΔC4, and GFP-MAD1ΔN3) were changed in either one or both zippers. To the extent that morphological changes in RFP-hsMAD2 occur via contact with GFP-hsMAD1, the profiles seen from GFP-hsMAD1ΔN1 (Fig. 6e) and GFP-hsMAD1ΔN2 (Fig. 7f) imply that both leucine zippers are necessary for intracellular MAD1-MAD2 binding. The confocal results describing MAD1-MAD2 contact are summarized in Table I.Table ISummary of hsMAD1 and hsMAD2 interactions based on confocal fluorescent imagesMAD1LocalizationRFP-MAD2-relocalization1-aRFP-tagged wild-type MAD2 in the presence of the indicated wild-type or mutant MAD1.MAD1/MAD21-bMAD1/MAD2 interaction interpreted based on GFP or RFP relocalization results.Wild-type (1–718)Nuclear punctatesNuclear punctates+ΔC1 (1–584)Nuclear punctatesNuclear punctates+ΔC2 (1–531)Nucleus ≫ cytoplasmNucleus + cytoplasm−ΔC3 (1–495)Nucleus ≫ cytoplasmNucleus + cytoplasm−ΔC4 (1–369)CytoplasmNucleus + cytoplasm−ΔN1 (312–718)Nucleus + cytoplasmCytoplasm+ΔN2 (407–718)CytoplasmCytoplasm+ΔN3 (553–718)Nucleus + cytoplasmNucleus + cytoplasm−m4 (324–498)Nucleus + cytoplasmNucleus + cytoplasm−MAD2LocalizationGFP-MAD2-relocalization1-cWild-type or mutant GFP-tagged MAD2 visualized in the presence of overexpressed wild-type MAD1.MAD1/MAD21-bMAD1/MAD2 interaction interpreted based on GFP or RFP relocalization results.Wild-type (1–205)Nucleus + cytoplasmNucleus + punctates+ΔC1 (1–167)Nucleus + cytoplasmNucleus + cytoplasm−ΔC2 (1–106)Nucleus + cytoplasmNucleus + cytoplasm−ΔN1 (68–205)Nucleus + cytoplasmNucleus + cytoplasm−ΔN2 (97–205)Nucleus + cytoplasmNucleus + cytoplasm−1-a RFP-tagged wild-type MAD2 in the presence of the indicated wild-type or mutant MAD1.1-b MAD1/MAD2 interaction interpreted based on GFP or RFP relocalization results.1-c Wild-type or mutant GFP-tagged MAD2 visualized in the presence of overexpressed wild-type MAD1. Open table in a new tab We found previously that all hsMAD2 truncations abolished heterodimerization of MAD1-MAD2 in vitro (16Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). To comparein vitro results with intracellular MAD1-MAD2 interactions, we constructed wild type and four GFP-hsMAD2 truncation mutants (Fig.7a). Each was tested for subcellular localization in the absence (Fig. 7b, panels 1–5) or presence (Fig.7b, panels 6–10) of overexpressed untagged hsMAD1. GFP-hsMAD2 wild type (Fig. 7b, panel 1) produced green whole cell fluorescence that was dramatically converted to nuclear punctates by co-expressed hsMAD1 (Fig. 7b, panel 6). By contrast, all deletions in either N or C terminus destroyed the capacity of GFP-MAD2 to be efficiently reconfigured by hsMAD1 into nuclear dots (Fig. 7b, panels 2–5and 7–10). Thus, consistent with our earlier in vitro binding results, intracellularly, the entire hsMAD2 protein is also required for efficient interaction with hsMAD1. The above results provide cell culture evidence that both leucine zipper domains in MAD1 are important for MAD1-MAD2 binding and that prior to the onset of mitosis MAD1 can convey MAD2 into nuclear punctates through direct contact. In the context of these observations, we note with interest that the MAD1H558 polymorphism impinges directly on the 557–571 leucine zipper needed for MAD1-MAD2 binding. To probe further the physiological significance of the MAD1R558/MAD1H558 polymorphism, we next sought in vivo evidence supportive of this change being advantageous for cellular proliferation. A finding of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the Mad1 558 locus would represent such in vivo evidence. The AccII restriction enzyme cleaves the “cgcg” sequence. In our search for LOH, we noted that the Arg to His single nucleotide polymorphism at codon 558 of hsMAD1 changes a “cgcg” to “cacg,” abolishing anAccII site (Fig.8a). Accordingly, AccII restriction would be diagnostic for this 558 polymorphism. We analyzed the AccII restriction of exon 17 from hsMad1 in several human specimens; some illustrative results are shown in Fig. 8b. For instance, spindle checkpoint-defective SW480 colon cancer was homozygously h/h at position 558. On the other hand, the checkpoint intact Hct116 and HeLa cells (29Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar) were 558r/r and 558r/h, respectively. To ask whether an Arg to His change could occur through somatic LOH, we examined eight breast tumor biopsies paired with their corresponding normal B cells. In"

A tight and finely tuned regulation of MAPK activity is therefore critical for the definition of a specific cellular response. We investigated the role of tyrosine-specific phosphatases (PTPs) in the regulation of ERK5. Although unique in its structure, ERK5 is activated in analogy to other MAPKs by dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues in its activation motif. In this study we concentrated on whether and how PTP-SL, a kinase-interacting motif-containing PTP, might be involved in the down-regulation of the ERK5 signal. We found that both proteins interact directly with each other in vitro and in intact cells, resulting in mutual modulation of their enzymatic activities. PTP-SL is a substrate of ERK5 and independent of phosphorylation binding to the kinase enhances its catalytic phosphatase activity. On the other hand, interaction with PTP-SL not only down-regulates endogenous ERK5 activity but also effectively impedes the translocation of ERK5 to the nucleus.

A broad variety of stimuli elicit MAPK activation, and MAPKs regulate a large number of distinct cellular responses (1Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar, 2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar, 3Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J.

Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). In the very same cell, MAPKs can even be involved in the control of different functions. In these cases the duration and the magnitude of MAPK activation are critical parameters that specify signal identity (5Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). In rat pheochromocytoma cells, for example, epidermal growth factor (EGF) as well as nerve growth factor activate MAPKs, however, cells proliferate in response to the first stimulus and differentiate in the presence of the latter (6Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). These distinct responses are due to the ability of nerve growth factor but not EGF to cause a sustained activation of MAPK. A tight and finely tuned regulation of MAPK activity is therefore critical for definition of a specific cellular response. MAPKs can be grouped into three main subfamilies: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and the p38 stress-activated protein kinases. ERK5, which is also termed big MAPK 1, differs considerably from the other family members in that it contains an unique loop-12 domain within the kinase region that is followed by an unusually long C-terminal tail of hitherto unknown function (7Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 8Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). ERK5 is activated by diverse stimuli such as cellular stress and growth factors (9Abe J. Kusuhara M.

Immunol. Res. 2000; 21: 233-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MAPK kinase MEK5 has been shown to specifically phosphorylate and thereby activate ERK5 (7Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 11Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar); the other components involved in the signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the activation of ERK5 are mostly unknown. Many of the ERK5 activating stimuli also affect other MAPK family members. The synergistic actions of both the ERK1/2 and the ERK5 pathways have for example been reported in the induction of cell transformation (12Pearson G. English J.M. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). On the other hand, downstream effects exerted by activated ERK5 and ERK1/2 can in many cases be clearly distinguished from each other (13Watson F.L. Heerssen H.M. Bhattacharyya A. Klesse L. Lin M.Z. Segal R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 14Cavanaugh J.E. Ham J. Hetman M. Poser S. Yan C. Xia Z. J.

Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) have for example demonstrated that ERK5 but not ERK2 is essential for proliferation and cell cycle progression in HeLa cells. More recently Karihaloo et al. (16Karihaloo A. O'Rourke D.A. Nickel C.H. Spokes K. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 9166-9173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have shown that ERK5 mediates EGF-induced morphogenesis in renal epithelial cells, whereas ERK2 activity is critically involved in cell motility upon stimulation with hepatocyte growth factor. MAPKs including ERK5 are generally activated by phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues in their activation motif; however, dephosphorylation of either residue is sufficient for kinase inactivation (17Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The present study concentrates on the question of whether and how PTP-SL might be involved in the down-regulation of the big MAPK 1/ERK5 signal. PTP-SL (18Hendriks W. Schepens J. Brugman C.

Leukemia. 1994; 8: 236-244PubMed Google Scholar), belongs to the kinase interacting motif (KIM)-containing phosphatases that have previously been shown by us and others to bind, dephosphorylate, and thereby inactivate signaling by ERK1/2 (24Pulido R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15340-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). KIM-containing PTPs are characterized by a very restricted expression pattern. They are not found in the nucleus and are generally considered to play a role in the short term inactivation of MAPKs (27Saxena M. Mustelin T. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that ERK5 and PTP-SL bind directly to each other. This interaction not only potently reduces kinase activity but also interferes with translocation of ERK5 to the nucleus. Our data show that ERK5 phosphorylates PTP-SL and that independent of phosphorylation binding the kinase stimulates phosphatase activity. Rabbit polyclonal anti-PTP-SL was obtained by immunization of rabbits with the peptide CHSMVQPEQAPKVLN coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem). For the generation of ERK5 antibodies, rabbits were immunized with a fusion protein of GST and ERK5 aa 410–558. The anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for immunoprecipitation and the HA.11 (BAbCo) for Western blot analysis. Phosphorylation state-specific antibodies for ERK5 and ERK2 were from BioSource Europe and New England BioLabs, respectively. Anti-ERK2 K23 and anti-histone H1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-RanGAP antibody was kindly provided by Frauke Melchior (Martinsried, Germany). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was from Bio-Rad, goat anti-mouse antibody was from Sigma, and donkey anti-goat antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Chemiluminescence reagents and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein A, protein G, and GSH-Sepharose beads were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. EGF was supplied by Invitrogen. The nitrocellulose membrane was from Schleicher & Schüll. All of the other reagents were obtained from Merck. ERK5 and MEK5 were amplified from human placenta cDNA by PCR using primers flanking the coding regions. For the expression in eukaryotic cells, both fragments were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The protein sequence of the cloned human MEK5 differs from the published sequence (8Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) by an insertion of 10 amino acids between glutamate 348 and isoleucine 349, which is also present in rat and mouse MEK5 (28Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). N-terminally HA-tagged ERK5 was generated by PCR. ERK5 and the truncated form ERK5kin (aa 1–409) consisting only of the kinase domain, were subcloned into pcDNA3-Fc, a modified vector containing 3′ of the multiple cloning site the coding sequence of the human Fcγ chain. The Fc-tagged proteins were purified from crude cell lysates of transfected HEK 293 cells using protein A-Sepharose. MEK5(D), the dominant active mutant of MEK5 (11Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis replacing serine 311 and threonine 315 by aspartate. Kinase inactive ERK5 KM was generated by exchanging lysine 83 for methionine. The expression constructs for PTP-SL WT and the catalytically inactive CS mutant in pRK5, a vector containing the cytomegalovirus early promotor, were described before (24Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-GFP-PTP-SL WT and CS were generated by fusing cDNA coding for the GFP 5′ to the coding sequence of PTP-SL. GST-IA2-β (aa 641–1015) (29Kawasaki E. Hutton J.C. Eisenbarth G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), GST-NC-PTP (aa 245–670) (GenBankTM accession number Z79693), and GST-HePTP (aa 1–339) (30Zanke B. Suzuki H. Kishihara K. Mizzen L. Minden M. Pawson A. Mak T.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were obtained by PCR using human placenta and glioblastoma cDNA. PCR fragments were cloned into pGEX5X vectors (Amersham Biosciences) in frame with the GST gene. The GST-STEP and the GST-PTP-SL fusion proteins were described elsewhere (24Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The GST-ERK5 fusion protein was constructed by subcloning a cDNA fragment encoding ERK5 aa 410–558 into the pGEX5X vector. All of the GST fusion proteins were expressed in the BL21 DE3 codon + (Stratagene) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The sequences of the primers used for the construction of all plasmids and for mutagenesis are available upon request. COS-7, HEK 293, and A431 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultivated following the supplier's instructions. PC12 cells (kindly provided by Philip Cohen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4500 mg/liter glucose, supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum. PC12 cells were generally grown on plastic dishes coated with collagen (Sigma). The cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. HEK 293 cells were transfected with 2 μg DNA/ml by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (31Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). For ectopic protein expression in COS-7 and PC12 cells, the cells were plated on 6-well dishes and were transfected with 1 μg of DNA/well and LipofectAMINE or LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen), respectively, following the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, the cells were transferred to serum starvation medium and cultured for another 24 h before stimulation and lysis. Transfected PC12 cells were selected with 1 mg/ml neomycin. The cell cultures were washed with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerine, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (10 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 0.5% aprotinin). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatants were precleared with 20 μl of Sepharose slurry. The immunoprecipitations were carried out as described before with slight modifications (32Buschbeck M. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Watson S.P. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In brief, anti-HA, anti-PTP-SL, or anti-ERK5 antibodies were added together with 20 μl of mixed protein A- and G-Sepharose and one volume of HNTG (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0,1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerine, and 10 mmNa4P2O7). Fc-tagged proteins were directly precipitated with the mix of protein A- and G-Sepharose. Forin vitro binding studies, 1 μg of each Fc and GST fusion protein were incubated in 250 μl of PBS (8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7,3) for 20 min at room temperature under constant shaking. After the addition of 0.3 volumes of HNTG, the samples were precleared and finally precipitated with 20 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads. In general, the precipitation samples were incubated for 3 h on a rotation wheel at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed three times with 0.5 ml of HNTG buffer, suspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to gel electrophoresis. For Western blot analysis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted. If quantification was necessary, the filters were exposed to the LAS1000 chemiluminescence camera (Fujifilm) and analyzed with the program Image Gauge 3.3 (Fujifilm). For in vitro kinase assays, the precipitates were washed twice with HNTG and twice with kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm orthovanadate). The samples were suspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C under constant shaking. For the measurement of substrate phosphorylation, kinase reactions were also supplemented with 1 μg of GST fusion proteins or 10 μg of myelin basic protein. The reaction was extended to 30 min if 1 μg of purified ERK5 protein was used. The assay was stopped by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling. The samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphorylation was detected by phosphorus imaging using the BAS2500 Reader (Fujifilm) and quantified with Image Gauge 3.3 (Fujifilm). The amount of precipitated kinase was visualized by immunoblot analysis. For the measurement of PTP activity, 1 μg of GST-PTP-SL was diluted into 20 μl of PBS and incubated with 1 μg of different proteins for 10 min at room temperature under constant shaking. The aliquots of 10 μl were then added to 100 μl of p-nitrophenyl phosphate buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) containing 3.7 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate as unspecific PTP substrate. After 2 h at 37 °C, the absorption at 405 nm was determined. For performance of in vitro phosphatase assays (see Fig. 5, A and B), ERK5 precipitates were washed twice with HNTG and twice with PTP assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA). The samples were resuspended in 20 μl of assay buffer containing the indicated amount of GST-PTP-SL fusion protein and were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C while shaking. Because these reaction were followed by in vitro kinase assays, they were stopped by washing with kinase assay buffer containing the phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate. The kinase assay was carried out as described above. COS-7 cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/cm2 on glass cover slips. The transfections were performed as described above, and the cells were processed for immunofluorescence after 24 h of further culture. The cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 5 min, rinsed once with −20 °C cold acetone, and washed twice with PBS. All further steps were carried out at room temperature. The samples were incubated in PBG (PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.045% teleostean fish gelatin) supplemented with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h, washed twice with PBG, and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-ERK5 antibody for 1 h. After three more washes with PBG, the cells were incubated with the secondary Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h. After one more PBG wash and three more PBS washes, the samples were rinsed in destilled water and mounted. DNA was stained for 10 min with 1 μg/ml bisbenzimid, which was included in the penultimate washing step. 48 h after transfection 1 × 106 COS-7 cells were trypsinated and collected by centrifugation at 500 × g. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0,5% Nonidet P-40) on ice for 5 min. The nuclei were precipitated by centrifugation at 500 × g, washed once with hypotonic lysis buffer, and finally dissolved in Laemmli buffer. To address the relevance of PTP-SL function in the regulation of diverse MAPK cascades, we investigated the potential interaction between ERK5 and the cytosolic form of the STEP-like phosphatase. We performed co-precipitation experiments with polyclonal anti-PTP-SL antibody and lysates from transfected HEK 293 cells. Fig.1A (top panel) shows PTP-SL association with hemagglutinin-tagged ERK5 (HA-ERK5) in those cells co-overexpressing both proteins. As can be seen in the second panel of Fig. 1A, in addition to HA-ERK5 endogenous ERK1/2 was also detected in the immunoprecipitates in the presence but not the absence of overexpressed PTP-SL. It is conceivable that ERK1/2 might compete with ERK5 for PTP binding. As expected from earlier studies describing the expression of PTP-SL predominantly in cell lineages of neuroendocrine origin (19Ogata M. Sawada M. Fujino Y. Hamaoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2337-2343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Shiozuka K. Watanabe Y. Ikeda T. Hashimoto S. Kawashima H.

Rec. 2000; 258: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we did not detect endogenous PTP-SL in HEK 293 cell lysates (Fig.1A, bottom panel). The interaction of ERK5 and PTP-SL was further demonstrated by performing the converse experiment as shown in Fig. 1B. When a truncated version of HA-ERK5 (HA-ERK5kin) that contained only the kinase domain but lacked the unique C-terminal tail was co-expressed with HA-tagged PTP-SL (HA-PTP-SL), we were readily able to pull down PTP-SL by precipitating ERK5kin (Fig. 1B, fourth lane). Addition of the IgG-Fc portion to the C terminus of the ERK5kin construct was necessary to visualize the bound phosphatase, which would otherwise have been masked by the heavy chain of the precipitating antibody. The question of whether the proteins interact directly was addressed by performing in vitro binding experiments with bacterially expressed PTP-SL and purified Fc-tagged ERK5 from transfected HEK 293 cells. Correct folding of the proteins was verified by determining their phosphatase or kinase activities (data not shown). Fig.2A shows that full-length ERK5 as well as the truncated ERK5kin protein directly interact with both wild type and catalytically inactive PTP-SL. Tarrega et al.(34Tarrega C. Blanco-Aparicio C. Munoz J.J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2629-2636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Tanoue et al. (35Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 36Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) identified docking motifs in ERK2 that mediate interaction with substrates and regulators including phosphatases. These docking motifs are also present and conserved in the ERK5 kinase domain and thus are likely to mediate the binding to PTP-SL. We then asked which domain of PTP-SL would be responsible for binding to ERK5 by incubating ERK5kin with GST fusion proteins that contained different portions of PTP-SL (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig.2C, not only the full cytosolic form of PTP-SL but also the juxtamembrane and the phosphatase domain alone were both interacting with ERK5. Interestingly, even the PTP-SL juxtamembrane construct lacking the KIM, a motif that was shown to mediate the interaction with ERK2 (24Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 25Saxena M. Williams S. Brockdorff J. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15340-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), was still able to bind to ERK5 (Fig. 2D). When we further performed the binding experiment with ERK5kin and PTP-SL in the presence of crude lysates of HEK 293 and A431 cells as source for proteins that might possibly compete for PTP-binding sites, associated ERK5 decreased to a degree that correlated with the amount of endogenous ERK1/2 interacting with PTP-SL (Fig. 2E). Taken together, this set of data shows that the interaction between ERK5 and PTP-SL is direct and involves the kinase domain of ERK5 and, even though not exclusively, the KIM-containing juxtamembrane region of PTP-SL. To examine whether PTP-SL itself could serve as ERK5 substrate, we performed in vitrokinase assays using activated ERK5 that was immunoprecipitated from EGF-stimulated COS-7 cells and as substrates several GST fusion proteins containing different portions of PTP-SL. Fig.3A shows that wild type PTP-SL as well as those proteins containing the juxtamembrane domain were readily phosphorylated by ERK5. On the other hand, the phosphatase domain did not serve as a substrate. We then tested the ability of ERK5 to phosphorylate additional KIM-containing PTPs like NC-PTP, STEP (22Lombroso P.J. Murdoch G. Lerner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7242-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and HePTP (30Zanke B. Suzuki H. Kishihara K. Mizzen L. Minden M. Pawson A. Mak T.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All of these phosphatases were phosphorylated; however, the cytosolic domain of the unrelated PTP IA2-β (29Kawasaki E. Hutton J.C. Eisenbarth G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was, as expected, not modified by ERK5 (Fig. 3B). We further asked whether complex formation between ERK5 and PTP-SL would alter enzymatic activity of the phosphatase. Therefore, we measured the activity of the bacterially expressed PTP-SL fusion protein upon binding to ERK5. As shown in Fig.4A, ERK5 as well as ERK5kin enhanced PTP-SL activity ∼3.5-fold, whereas GST and IgG alone had no effect. Because PTP-SL was phosphorylated, although not quantitatively, by a preparation of ERK5 protein isolated from transfected HEK 293 cells (data not shown), we tested the influence of this phosphorylation on PTP-SL activity by performing in vitro kinase reactions in the presence and absence of ATP and subsequently quantified the resulting phosphatase activity. As shown in Fig. 4B, PTP-SL activity was again strongly enhanced in the presence of either wild type ERK5, ERK5kin, or the kinase-inactive mutant ERK5 KM but was only very slightly decreased by the addition of ATP in all cases. These results indicate that binding to but not phosphorylation by ERK5 makes a major impact on PTP-SL activity. To answer the question of whether PTP-SL might regulate ERK5 activity, we performed in vitro phosphatase reactions using various amounts of GST-PTP-SL fusion proteins together with a preparation of activated ERK5 and subsequently measured kinase activity. COS-7 cells co-expressing the dominant active form of MEK5 were used as source for activated ERK5. MEK5 was shown to be the MAPK kinase specifically activating ERK5 and to possess constitutive activity if serine 311 and threonine 315 were mutated to aspartate (8Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar,11Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Wild type PTP-SL almost completely abolished ERK5 kinase activity, whereas the catalytically inactive CS mutant affected neither autophosphorylation of ERK5 nor phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig.5B, the degree of ERK5 inactivation correlated with the amount of PTP-SL protein utilized. We then tested whether PTP-SL would be capable of inactivating ERK5 in transfected COS-7 cells by performing immunocomplex kinase assays after stimulation of cells with hydrogen peroxide or EGF. Whereas wild type PTP-SL reduced ERK5 kinase activity to basal levels, the PTP-SL mutant that lacked phosphatase activity seemed to further enhance ERK5 autophosphorylation (Fig. 5C, upper panel). ERK5 appeared as a doublet resulting from a mobility shift of a small fraction of the enzyme that was hardly detectable in Western blot but clearly visible in the autoradiograph. This shift is probably due to phosphorylation of ERK5 because the amount of the upper band was found to correlate with the degree of kinase activation (14Cavanaugh J.E. Ham J. Hetman M. Poser S. Yan C. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 434-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mody N. Leitch J. Armstrong C. Dixon J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar); when dominant active MEK5 was co-expressed this shift was virtually quantitative (Fig. 5, A and B). Because the relative activation of ERK5 after EGF and hydrogen peroxide treatment of cells was only moderate because of its high basal activity, we additionally expressed the constitutively active MEK5 construct to achieve a more pronounced ERK5 activation. Wild type PTP-SL partially counteracted the effect of MEK5 and reduced ERK5 activity to a level that may reflect the balan"

In the absence of structural data on monozinc aminopeptidases, site-directed mutagenesis studies based on alignment of the sequence of APA with those of other monozinc aminopeptidases were used to probe the organization of the APA active site.

Some of these conserved residues were also recently identified in other related aminopeptidases such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone-degrading enzyme (EC 3.4.19.6) (20Papadopoulos T. Kelly J.A.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). On the basis of our data, we proposed a model for the organization of the active site of APA and a putative catalytic mechanism for this enzyme (25Iturrioz X. Rozenfeld R. Michaud A. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortès C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14440-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) similar to that proposed for thermolysin on the basis of x-ray diffraction studies (26Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar). According to this model, in the absence of substrate, the zinc atom is tetracoordinated by three zinc ligands (His-385, His-389, and Glu-408) and a water molecule. When the substrate enters the active site, its recognition and orientation are ensured by interactions with several residues. First, in the S1 subsite, which recognizes only N-terminal acidic residues, Ca2+ interacts with the P1 carboxylate side chain of the substrate. In the anionic binding site, Glu-352 interacts with the free N-terminal part of the substrate. The zinc atom is simultaneously hexacoordinated by establishing two additional interactions with the carbonyl group of the scissile peptide bond and the unprotonated αamino group of the substrate. The negative charge of Glu-386 polarizes the zinc-coordinated water molecule and promotes its nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond to be cleaved. The resulting tetrahedral intermediate is stabilized by electrostatic interactions with the zinc ion and hydrogen bonds with Glu-386, Tyr-471, and Glu-352. Finally, the transfer of a proton from Glu-386 to the leaving nitrogen of the scissile peptide bond triggers the cleavage of the peptide bond and the release of the products. Determination of the x-ray crystal structure of LTA4H/aminopeptidase, a bifunctional enzyme, recently revealed the crucial role of certain residues in zinc coordination, exopeptidase specificity, and catalytic activity (27Thunnissen M.M. Nordlund P. Haeggstrom J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The roles of these residues are similar to those of their counterparts in APA, as previously determined by site-directed mutagenesis. We then carried out computer-assisted modeling of APA using the crystal structure of LTA4H as a template and the functional data collected from our previous site-directed mutagenesis studies. We constructed a three-dimensional model of the APA ectodomain from residues 79 to 559; this domain surrounds the zinc-binding domain. We subsequently docked the specific and selective APA inhibitor glutamate phosphonate (28Lejczak B. Choszczak M.P.D. Kafarski P. J. Enzyme Inhib. 1993; 7: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) into the active site. This made it possible to produce, for the first time, a three-dimensional representation of a strict (i.e.monofunctional) monozinc aminopeptidase and of the interactions between the active site and the inhibitor glutamate phosphonate, an analog of the transition state, thereby reproducing the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme that occur during catalysis. This new model will be useful for further investigation of the organization of the APA active site and for the definition of a pharmacophore of the APA inhibitor, a powerful tool for the design of specific and selective inhibitors for use as central antihypertensive agents. In this model, we identified a salt bridge interaction between two strictly conserved residues, Arg-220 and Asp-227. This interaction appears to be necessary for cohesion of the N-terminal β-sheet domain and therefore for correct folding of the N-terminal domain surrounding the active site. We used site-directed mutagenesis to validate our model by confirming the functional role of these residues. We replaced Arg-220 with alanine and aspartate and Asp-227 with alanine and arginine and inverted the two residues. We then characterized the maturation, trafficking, and enzymatic activity of the recombinant wild-type and mutant APAs. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Hitchin, England) and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Expand high-fidelityTaq polymerase PCR system was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). The liposomal transfection reagent LipofectAMINE, the pcDNA3.1-His vector, and the anti-Xpress antibody were purchased from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands). The anti-His5 antibody was purchased from QIAGEN Inc. Immobilized cobalt affinity columns (Talon) were obtained from CLONTECH (Heidelberg, Germany). The synthetic substrate α-l-glutamyl-β-naphthylamide (GluNA) was purchased from Bachem (Bunderdorf, Switzerland). As no experimentally determined three-dimensional structure is yet available for APA, we constructed a three-dimensional model by homology modeling. The recently published x-ray crystallographic structure of human LTA4H (27Thunnissen M.M. Nordlund P. Haeggstrom J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) was used as the template, and Accelrys homology software was used to construct the model for APA. The correct alignment of the human LTA4H and mouse APA sequences was determined from multiple sequence alignments between several proteins of this family and experimental information obtained in previous site-directed mutagenesis studies on APA carried out in our laboratory (17Vazeux G.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3061-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A preliminary model was obtained from the transfer of coordinates from LTA4H to APA in the aligned regions. The model was completed by adding the missing loops connecting the moieties already obtained. The APA model obtained therefore concerned only residues 79–539, corresponding to the region most highly conserved between APA and LTA4H (31% similarity). We were unable to identify suitable templates for modeling the remaining C-terminal APA sequence and therefore present here a model covering only residues 79–539. However, this part of the APA protein seems to be the most important, at least as far as enzymatic activity is concerned. The preliminary three-dimensional 3-D0 model obtained by the crude transfer of coordinates from LTA4H to APA on the basis of homology was then surrounded by a shell of 2700 water molecules to take into account the effect of the surrounding solvent during the refinement procedure. The refinement procedure consisted of several energy minimization steps carried out by the conjugate gradient method. We began by fixing the backbone of the protein such that only the protein side chains and water molecule movements were variable. Next, the whole system was relaxed. All Arg, Lys, Asp, and Glu side chains were considered ionic, and a 20-Å cutoff point was used to truncate non-bonded interactions. The dielectric constant was 1. We used the Accelrys CFF97 force field, as this class II force field provided all the necessary parameters for calculating all Zn2+ interactions with other groups in the system. The resulting 3-D1 model was then subjected to another refinement procedure including several rounds of energy minimization (until convergence) and short molecular dynamics (MD) runs (100 ps at 300 K). This process was carried out to check the stability of the model over time. We checked the consistency of the 3-D2 model obtained at the end of these calculations, especially in the active-site region (according to several geometric requirements concerning the zinc atom coordination shell) and the water shell region. It appeared that many water molecules escaped from the shell that initially surrounded the protein, creating several ionic groups that were exposed to others without their solvation shell. This resulted in modification of the exposed active-site configuration and therefore of zinc atom coordination. We therefore decided to restart from the 3-D1system, placed within a 85-Å3 water box, and to carry out the refinement procedure described above (minimization + MD). At this stage, the system consisted of the protein and 16,886 water molecules. Periodic boundary conditions were used with the same cutoff point as before. The resulting 3-D3 model was used in all subsequent calculations. We carried out docking calculations in the 3-D3 model using as ligands the selective APA inhibitor glutamate phosphonate, bestatin, and glutamate-thiol. The inhibitors were introduced according to the position of bestatin in LTA4H. Three models were built in this way. Each protein + ligand + solvent box was then relaxed step by step, until all the degrees of freedom were considered in the minimization and MD processes. After several steps of energy minimization + 100-ps MD + energy minimization, the three models were considered to be stable, as the residual mean square deviations between the Cα atoms of the starting structure and the final structure were <1 Å. We also checked the stability of the 3-D3 model by replacing Arg-220 and Asp-227 with alanines and performing supplementary MD runs. All the preliminary calculations were performed on SGI O2 workstations, and the heaviest calculations were performed at the Centre Informatique National de l'Enseignement Superieur (CINES) supercomputing center on an Origin 3800. The mouse cDNA encoding APA was inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3.1-His (29Iturrioz X. Vazeux G. Celerier J. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortès C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3061-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and mutants were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis as previously described (30Herlitze S. Koenen M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Two overlapping regions of the cDNA were amplified separately using two flanking oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide A (5′-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGA-3′, bp 862–883) as a forward primer and oligonucleotide B (5′-GAATCCTAAGATAGAGGCCCGGAG)-3′, bp 3215–3238) as a reverse primer, and two overlapping oligonucleotides containing the mutated residues (C1D1 for Ala-220, C2D2 for Asp-220, C3D3 for Ala-227, C4D4 for Arg-227, C5D5 for Asp-220/Arg-227, and C6D6 for Ala-221). The forward primers were as follows: C1, 5′-ACAGATGCCGCGAAGTCCTTC-3′; C2, 5′-ACAGATGCCGACAAGTCCTTC-3′; C3, 5′-CCTTGTTTCGCAGAACCCAAC-3′; C4, 5′-CCTTGTTTCCGAGAACCCAAC-3′; C5, 5′-ACAGATGCCGACAAGTCCTTCCCTTGTTTCAGGGAACCCAAC; and C6, 5′-GATGCCAGGGCGTCCTTCCCT-3′. The reverse primers were as follows: D1, 5′-GAAGGACTTCGCGGCATCTGT-3′; D2, 5′-GAAGGACTTGTCGGCATCTGT-3′; D3, 5′-GTTGGGTTCTGCGAAACAAGG-3′; D4, 5′-GTTGGGTTCTCGGAAACAAGG-3′; D5, 5′-GTTGGGTTCCCTGAAACAAGGGAAGGACTTGTCGGCATCTGT-3′; and D6, 5′-AGGGAAGGACGCCCTGGCATC-3′. The underlined bases encode the new amino acid residue replacing arginine at position 220 (C1, C2, D1, and D2), aspartate at position 227 (C3, C4, D3, and D4), Arg-220 and Asp-227 (C5 and D5), and lysine at position 221 (C6 and D6). Nucleotide numbering is as for the mouse APA sequence (9Wu Q. Lahti J.M. Air G.M. Burrows P.D. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) deposited in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank (accession number M29961). The products of the first two amplifications (A-D1–6 and B-C1–6) were used as the template for a second PCR with the two flanking oligonucleotides A and B. For all PCRs, high-fidelityTaq polymerase (1 unit) was used (25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min). The final 2376-bp PCR product was digested with HindIII andEcoRV, and the resulting 1505-bpHindIII-EcoRV fragment containing the mutation was used to replace the corresponding non-mutated region (HindIII-EcoRV) of the full-length APA cDNA. The presence of the mutation and the absence of nonspecific mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA Sequencer with dye deoxy terminator chemistry. CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum, 0.5 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A stable cell line producing polyhistidine-tagged wild-type APA was established as previously described (29Iturrioz X. Vazeux G. Celerier J. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortès C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3061-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Stably transfected CHO cells were harvested, and a crude membrane preparation was obtained as previously described (29Iturrioz X. Vazeux G. Celerier J. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortès C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3061-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Wild-type His-APA was purified from the solubilized crude membrane preparation by metal affinity chromatography with a metal chelate resin column (Talon-Co2+) as previously described (29Iturrioz X. Vazeux G. Celerier J. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortès C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3061-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purity of the final preparation was assessed by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205416) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211571) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected with 1 μg of the plasmid containing either wild-type or mutant His-APA cDNA using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A population of cells enriched in transiently transfected cells was selected for resistance to 750 μg/ml Geneticin (G418) over a 10-day period. These resistant cells (300,000 cells/well) were then incubated for 30 min in methionine/cysteine serum-free Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (pulse). The cells were then incubated for various lengths of time (0, 90, and 180 min) in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium (chase). The cell medium was discarded; the cells were harvested; and proteins were solubilized by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 600 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the insoluble material. The supernatant was incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-His5 antibody (5 μl, 1 μg) and protein A-Sepharose (50% (w/v) suspension in solubilization buffer; Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C for immunoprecipitation. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with solubilization buffer and once with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). Proteins were eluted by boiling in 25 μl of Laemmli buffer and resolved by 5% SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205416) Google Scholar). The gel was dried and placed against x-ray film for autoradiography. A population of CHO cells enriched in transiently transfected cells producing wild-type and mutant His-APAs was subjected to a 30-min pulse and a 90-min chase. The cells were lysed, and the proteins were solubilized and immunoprecipitated. The samples were washed and centrifuged as described above. The immune complexes were then eluted by boiling for 15 min in 100 μl of denaturing buffer (0.01% SDS). The samples were incubated with or without 5 milliunits of peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at pH 9 for 18 h at 37 °C or 1 unit of endoglycosidase H (Endo H; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at pH 6 for 18 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 5% acrylamide gels, which were then dried and placed next to x-ray film for autoradiography. CHO cells were seeded (25,000 cells) on 14-mm diameter coverslips and transiently transfected with constructs encoding wild-type and mutant His-APAs. The cells were cultured for 48 h in Ham's F-12 medium in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2and 95% air. They were then incubated with cycloheximide (70 μm) in Ham's F-12 medium for 90 min, fixed, and permeabilized by incubation for 5 min in 100% ice-cold methanol. The cells were rinsed three times in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and then saturated by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. They were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-rat APA serum (32Song L. Ye M. Troyanovskaya M. Wilk E. Wilk S. Healy D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F546-F557PubMed Google Scholar), a kind gift from Dr. S. Wilk, in PBS and 2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times with cold PBS and then incubated with a 1:500 dilution of cyanin-3-conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit antibody in PBS and 2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed four times with PBS and mounted in Mowiol (Sigma) for confocal microscopy. For double labeling, fluorescein-conjugated concanavalin A (50 μg, 1:100) was added together with the secondary antibody. Transiently transfected AtT20 cells were analyzed by evaluating immunofluorescence under the same conditions. Cells were examined with a Leica TCS SP II confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with an argon/krypton laser and configured with a Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope. Cyanin-3 fluorescence was detected after 100% excitation at 568 nm. For double detection of cyanin-3 and fluorescein, fluorescence was assessed after 100% excitation at 568 nm and 100% excitation at 488 nm, respectively. Fluorescence was detected in windows of 580–630 and 500–550 nm. Images (1024 × 1024 pixels) were obtained with a ×63 magnification oil-immersion objective. Each image corresponded to a cross-section of the cell. For both protein concentration determination and GluNA hydrolysis, purified recombinant wild-type His-APA and either solubilized untransfected or transiently transfected CHO cells producing wild-type or mutant APAs were used. Wild-type His-APA was purified as described above. Untransfected cells and cells transiently expressing mutant His-APAs (300,000 cells) were harvested and solubilized by incubation overnight in 400 μl of 0.5% CHAPS in Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The Bradford assay was used for purified wild-type His-APA and solubilized cells using bovine serum albumin as a standard to determine the total protein concentration of the samples. Dot blots were then used to determine the concentration of His-APA in the solubilized samples. A standard curve was generated by spotting various amounts of purified His-APA on a nitrocellulose membrane. We then spotted equivalent amounts of total protein for each of the solubilized samples. Untransfected CHO cells were used to identify nonspecific immunoreactivity in the solubilized cells. Dot blots of recombinant APAs were analyzed with a monoclonal anti-Xpress antibody (1:5000 dilution). Immunoreactive material was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:20,000 dilution) and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL,Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, England). Chemiluminescence was measured by microdensitometric scanning of the dot blots. The concentrations of mutant His-APAs were calculated from the purified His-APA standard curve. The activities of the wild-type and mutant His-APAs were determined by monitoring the rate of hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate (GluNA) as previously described (33Chauvel E.N. Coric P. Llorens-Cortès C. Wilk S. Roques B.P. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-APAs were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5 × 10−4m GluNA and 4 mmCaCl2 in a final volume of 100 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4). Bestatin, a nonspecific aminopeptidase inhibitor, was used at a concentration of 1 μm, which did not inhibit APA, but prevents degradation of the substrate by aminopeptidases such as B, N, and W and cytosolic aminopeptidases (34Schalk C. d'Orchymont H. Jauch M.F. Tarnus C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,35Tieku S. Hooper N.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1725-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The rate of substrate hydrolysis was calculated for an equivalent level of expression for each mutant. Statistical comparisons were performed with Student's unpaired t test. Differences were considered significant if p was <0.05. The alignment of the LTA4H and APA sequences used for homology modeling is presented in Fig.1 A. Fig. 1 Bpresents the structure of the entire protein, showing its organization into three domains: the N-terminal domain consisting mainly of β-sheets, the globular active-site domain, and the C-terminal helical domain. The N- and C-terminal domains have a large interface in common. The active site was found to be locate"

We searched for proteins that bind to the αIIb cytoplasmic tail using the yeast two-hybrid assay with a cDNA library of the megakaryocyte-derived cell line and identified a protein, ancient ubiquitous protein 1 (Aup1), that is ubiquitously expressed in human cells. Observation of UT7/TPO cells expressing a red fluorescent protein-tagged Aup1 indicated its localization in the cytoplasm. Immunoprecipitation of UT7/TPO cells by an antibody for Aup1 revealed that ∼40% of αIIb is complexed with Aup1. Binding study with an αIIb cytoplasmic tail peptide and glutathioneS-transferase-Aup1 fusion protein revealed a low affinity (K d = 90 μm). Subsequent yeast two-hybrid assay indicated binding of Aup1 to cytoplasmic tails of other integrin α subunits. Binding study with the purified Aup1 and various glutathione S-transferase-αIIbcytoplasmic tail peptides revealed specific binding of Aup1 to the membrane-proximal sequence (KVGFFKR) that is conserved among the integrin α subunits and plays a crucial role in the αIIbβ3 inside-out signaling. As Aup1 possesses domains related to signal transduction, these results suggest involvement of Aup1 in the integrin signaling.

It binds to various adhesive proteins including fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, vitronectin, and fibronectin that contain a core amino acid sequence of arginine-glycine-aspartic acids (RGD). Binding of fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 leads to platelet aggregation and finally to thrombus formation at the injured vascular sites. A pivotal role of αIIbβ3 in hemostasis is supported by the clinical observation that the congenital deficiency of αIIbβ3, Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, results in lifelong bleeding tendency (1Kato A. Crit. Rev. Oncol./Hematol. 1997; 26: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Whereas αIIbβ3 on resting platelets does not bind soluble fibrinogen, once platelets are activated, conformation of the extracellular domains of the αIIbβ3 is altered and its ligand-binding affinity is increased (affinity modulation) (2Smyth S.S. Joneckis C.C. Parise L.V. Blood. 1993; 81: 2827-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This process of the inside-out signaling is considered to be mediated by modification of the short cytoplasmic tails of αIIb and β3 subunits; however, the mechanism remains to be elucidated. The nuclear magnetic resonance structural analysis of the αIIb cytoplasmic tail revealed a closed conformation where the highly conserved N-terminal membrane-proximal region forms an α-helix followed by a turn, and the acidic C-terminal loop interacts with the N-terminal helix (3Vinogradova O. Haas T. Plow E.F. Qin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Deletion of almost the entire αIIb-cytoplasmic tail and mutations in its N-terminal sequence (GFFKR) conserved among the integrin α subunits enhance the affinity of αIIbβ3 for ligands (4O'Toole T.E.

Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of the β3 subunit also has an amino acid sequence that is conserved among integrin β subunits: a stretch of 8 amino acids (KLLITIHD) adjacent to the transmembrane domain. In a similar fashion to the αIIb subunit, deletion or mutation in this conserved region induces activation of αIIbβ3 (6Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 7Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

These observations suggest that membrane-proximal regions of the cytoplasmic domains of both subunits exert a negative regulatory function and lock αIIbβ3 in a low affinity state. Negative regulation may be mediated by the interaction between αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic tails, possibly through a salt bridge between Arg-995 in αIIb and Asp-723 in β3 (6Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), or binding of intracellular proteins to αIIb and/or β3 subunits. Two candidates for the modulator proteins have been reported: calcium- and integrin-binding protein (CIB)1 (8Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Paraise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and β3-endonexin (9Shattil S.J. O'Toole T. Eigenthaler M. Thon V. Williams M. Babior B.M. Ginsberg M.H.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which bind to αIIband β3 cytoplasmic tails, respectively. Although CIB is unlikely to have a regulatory effect on αIIbβ3 ligand binding function (11Vallar L. Melchior C. Plançon S. Drobecq H. Lippens G. Regnault V. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17257-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), β3-endonexin fused to GST protein induces the conformational change of αIIbβ3 and activates it when co-transfected with αIIb and β3 subunits in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Another mechanism of modification has been recently suggested: an interaction between cytoplasmic tails of αIIbβ3 and the actin cytoskeleton. αIIbβ3 and the actin cytoskeleton are physically linked by binding of talin to the β3 cytoplasmic tail (12Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28071-28077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), and αIIbβ3 in resting platelets may be constrained in a low affinity state by the actin cytoskeleton (13Bennett J.S. Zigmond S. Vilaire G. Cunningham M.E. Bednar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25301-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). An increase in the cytosolic calcium evoked by agonist stimulation initiates actin filament turnover and may lead to relief of the cytoskeletal constraints on αIIbβ3, resulting in a high affinity state of αIIbβ3. Among these possible modification mechanisms, which one works in platelets remains to be determined. In contrast, binding of fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 leads to platelet shape change, release of granules, and platelet aggregation. These sequential biological phenomena are mediated by the outside-in signaling of αIIbβ3, calcium mobilization, increase in the cytoplasmic pH, thromboxane A2 generation, and tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins including focal adhesion kinase and members of the Src family proteins (1Kato A. Crit. Rev. Oncol./Hematol. 1997; 26: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These signaling proteins are complexed with the actin cytoskeleton and are recruited to the focal contacts. In this process, the β3 cytoplasmic tail (residues 740–762) binds to the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2 when tyrosine residues (Tyr-747 and Tyr-759) are phosphorylated (14Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, the β3 cytoplasmic tail is involved in clot retraction by transmitting the contractile force evoked by the rearrangement of the cytoskeletal proteins to the extracellular matrix (15Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Leong L. Liu B.-Q. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, several proteins that bind to the β3cytoplasmic tail and are implicated in the αIIbβ3 signaling have been identified; however , little is known about proteins that bind to and modify the αIIb cytoplasmic tail. In this study, we searched for proteins that bind to the αIIb cytoplasmic tail in the thrombopoietin-dependent acute megakaryocytic leukemia-derived cell line, UT7/TPO (16Komatsu N. Kunitama M. Hagiwara T. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Eguchi M. Yamamoto M. Miura Y. Blood. 1996; 87: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by the yeast-two hybrid assay and identified a protein, Aup1, that binds to the conserved membrane-proximal sequence of the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin α subunits. UT7/TPO cell line (16Komatsu N. Kunitama M. Hagiwara T. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Eguchi M. Yamamoto M. Miura Y. Blood. 1996; 87: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was maintained with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 10 ng/ml recombinant human thrombopoietin (TPO) (Kirin Brewery, Tokyo, Japan). Cell lines including HL 60, K562, U937, Jurkat, Raji, and CMK (17Sato T. Fuse A. Eguchi M. Hayashi Y. Ryo R. Adachi M. Kishimoto Y. Teramura M. Mizoguchi H. Shima Y. Komori I. Sunami S. Okimoto Y. Nakajima H. Br. J. Haematol. 1989; 72: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), established from acute myelocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, diffuse histiocytic lymphoma, T cell leukemia, Burkitt (B cell) lymphoma, and acute megakaryocytic leukemia, respectively, were maintained with RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Other cell lines including 293, MCF7, A549, HeLa, and HepG2, established from embryonic kidney, breast carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, epitheloid cervical carcinoma, and hepatocarcinoma, respectively, were maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The cDNA sequences for the cytoplasmic domains of various integrin α and β subunits were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from RNA extracted from UT7/TPO for αIIb, α2, αV, and β3, HepG2 for α1, Raji for α5, K562 for αM, and HL60 for β1 and β2, respectively. The cDNA sequences for a mutant αIIb (F992A) and for membrane-proximal (αIIb MP; KVGFFKR) and membrane-distal (αIIb MD; NRPPLEEDDEEGE) segments of the αIIb cytoplasmic tail were amplified using the normal αIIb cytoplasmic tail cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of each cDNA fragment amplified by PCR was confirmed using the ABI Prism dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems Japan, Tokyo, Japan). A cDNA library was constructed by ligating cDNA synthesized from UT7/TPO RNA to a pAD-Gal4 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA sequence for the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin αIIb subunit was ligated in-frame to a pBD-Gal4 vector (Stratagene). Procedures for screening and the filter lift assay to confirm interactions between the bait and target proteins were according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, yeast YRG-2 cells were transformed with a pAD-Gal4 plasmid encoding the UT7/TPO cDNA and a pBD-Gal4 plasmid encoding the αIIbbait. Then, yeast cells were plated on selective SD agar plates without leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (Leu− Trp−His−). Colonies grown on the selective plates, indicating interactions between target and bait proteins, were subjected to the filter lift assay to examine the β-galactosidase activity to confirm the interaction. Positive yeast colonies were transferred to Whatman filter papers, frozen in the liquid nitrogen, thawed, and incubated with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (0.3 mg/ml) in Z buffer (per liter, 16.1 g of Na2HPO4/7H2O, 5.5 g of NaH2PO4/7H2O, 0.75 g of KCl, 0.246 g of MgSO4/7H2O, and 2.7 ml of 2-mercaptoethanol; pH 7.0). Colonies that produced blue color were picked up for the subsequent experiments. To examine interactions between the target protein and cytoplasmic tails of various integrin subunits including αIIb, α1, α2, α5, αM, αV, β1, β2, and β3, yeast two-hybrid assays were performed in a similar fashion. To compare interactions between the target protein and the cytoplasmic domains of various integrin subunits, the quantitative β-galactosidase assay (18Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) was performed. Briefly, yeast cells grown in 5 ml of medium at 30 °C until the near log phase (OD600 = ∼1.0) were resuspended in Z buffer (200 μl) with glycerol (50 μl). After one cycle of freeze-thawing, 1 mm PMSF and acid-washed glass beads were added to the samples, followed by vigorous vortexing. Then, 50 μl of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (4 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was added to the supernatants and the samples were incubated at 30 °C until a yellow color developed. After addition of 120 μl of Na2CO3(1 m), the OD420 of each sample was measured. Assays were normalized to the yeast concentration (OD600) of each sample, and the β-galactosidase activity was calculated as follows; β-galactosidase units = 1,000 × OD420/t × V × OD600, where t = time of incubation in minutes, V = volume of culture added to Z buffer in ml (5 ml). Approximately 30 μg of the total RNA extracted from UT7/TPO cells was electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose/formaldehyde gels, transferred to the nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom), and hybridized with a full-length Aup1 cDNA fragment labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To compare the expression of Aup1 transcripts among different human tissues, the Human 12-lane MTN Blot (CLONTECH Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was hybridized with the same probe. Peptides for Aup1 (RLTPADKAEHMKRQRHPRLR) (Fig.1,A and B), αIIb and β3cytoplasmic tails, to which a cysteine residue was added at the N terminus for the antibody production, were synthesized using PSSM-8 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Each peptide was coupled to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma-Aldrich) and injected subcutaneously to rabbits for immunization. Platelets were isolated from the platelet-rich plasma of the normal peripheral blood, and leukocytes were isolated from the buffy coat after removal of erythrocytes by hypotonic lysis in 0.14 m NH4Cl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.2) at 37 °C. Microscopic observation revealed that more than 90% of the prepared leukocytes were neutrophils. To extract proteins, platelets, leukocytes, UT7/TPO, and other cell lines including CMK, HL60, K562, U937, Jurkat, Raji, 293, HepG2, HeLa, MCF7, and A547 were resuspended in the cell lysis buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm PMSF, 1.8 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100). Samples were incubated for 30 min on ice with occasional vortexing, and the cell lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to the nitrocellulose membranes (Trans-blot transfer medium, Nippon Bio-Rad Laboratories, Yokohama, Japan). After blocking with 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h, membranes were incubated with a preimmune rabbit serum or the rabbit antiserum for the Aup1 peptide (Aup1–2) for 1 h, and then with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (DAKO Japan, Kyoto, Japan). Signals on membranes were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). To study the subcellular localization of Aup1, a full-length Aup1 cDNA was ligated into the pDsRed1-N1 vector that encodes a red fluorescent protein (RFP) (CLONTECH). Then, UT7/TPO cells were transfected with a control vector and a plasmid encoding the Aup1-RFP fusion protein by electroporation using the Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). After selection with neomycin, stable cell lines that express RFP (UT7/TPO.VR4-4) and Aup1-RFP fusion proteins (UT7/TPO.Aup1 R23-1) were established. To examine the subcellular localization of Aup1, UT7/TPO.VR4-4 and UT7/TPO.Aup1R23-1 cells were applied to glass coverslips and observed using the LSM 510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany) with appropriate filters. For the nuclear staining, cells were treated with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted with a medium containing 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). UT7/TPO cell extracts (600 μg of protein) with the cell lysis buffer containing 1% digitonin and 1 mm Ca2+ were incubated with a preimmune rabbit serum or the Aup1–2 antiserum (40 μl) for 1 h, and then with protein-G-Sepharose beads (30 μl) (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. After washing with the cell lysis buffer, the beads were resuspended in the SDS sample buffer and boiled, and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis using mouse monoclonal antibodies for the αIIb(SZ22, Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan) and β3 subunits (SZ21, Cosmo Bio). Signals were detected with the ECL system after incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (DAKO). To measure how much part of the cellular αIIb is complexed with Aup1, the immunodepletion assay was performed. After preincubation with protein-G beads, UT7-TPO cell lysates (500 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated twice with the control rabbit or the Aup1–2 serum (40 μl) and protein-G beads (50 μl). Then, aliquots of the supernatants (1–10 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis using the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) and the SZ22 antibody. Concentration of the residual (free) αIIb subunit was quantified by densitometry of the respective αIIb bands to calculate the percentage of αIIb bound to Aup1. The cDNA sequences for Aup1, the normal and a mutant (F992A) αIIb cytoplasmic tails, and the membrane-proximal (αIIb MP) and membrane-distal segments (αIIb MD) were ligated in-frame to the pGEX-4T vector that encodes GST (Amersham Biosciences). For production of GST fusion proteins, DH5α cells transfected with the respective plasmids were incubated at 25 °C until the culture reached the mid-log phase (OD600 = ∼0.8), at which time 25 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added. After incubation for an additional 2 h, the bacteria were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm PMSF and 1 mg/ml lysozyme, followed by sonication. Triton X-100 was then added (1%), and the supernatant was incubated with the GSH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. To examine association between Aup1 and cytoplasmic tails of αIIb and β3, beads that bound the GST-Aup1 fusion protein (125 μg) and the control GST protein (62.5 μg) were incubated with the UT7/TPO cell extract (1 mg of protein) in the GST reaction buffer (200 μl, the cell lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100) for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Thereafter, beads were washed with the GST reaction buffer, resuspended in the SDS sample buffer, and boiled, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis using the PVDF membrane, the rabbit antiserum for the cytoplasmic tails of αIIb and β3, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins. To identify the αIIb sequence to which Aup1 binds, Aup1 cleaved from the immobilized GST-Aup1 fusion protein by thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions was preincubated with GSH- and GST-Sepharose beads in the GST reaction buffer. Then, the supernatants (50 μl containing 0.7 μg of Aup1; 0.4 μm) was incubated with the immobilized GST-αIIb cytoplasmic tail fusion proteins (20 μm), including the normal and a mutant (F992A) αIIb, αIIb MP, and αIIb MD segments, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using the PVDF membrane and the Aup1–2 antiserum. The synthetic αIIb cytoplasmic peptide was preincubated with the GST-Sepharose beads for 30 min at room temperature, and the supernatants (20–720 μm) were incubated with the immobilized GST-Aup1 fusion protein (1 μg, 1.5 μm) for 1 h at room temperature in the GST reaction buffer (10 μl). Then, various amounts of the supernatants, the original αIIb peptide, and the peptide preabsorbed by GST beads were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis using the PVDF membrane and the rabbit antiserum for the αIIbcytoplasmic tail. The resulting immunoblots of the αIIbcytoplasmic tail were quantified by densitometry, and the affinity of Aup1 for binding to the αIIb cytoplasmic tail was calculated by Scatchard analysis (19Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17749) Google Scholar). To search for proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin αIIbsubunit, we constructed a cDNA library from a megakaryocyte-derived cell line, UT7/TPO. UT7/TPO cells constitutively express αIIbβ3 on the cellular surface, as confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (data not shown). Screening of the cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid assay with a bait of the αIIb cytoplasmic tail identified a 900-bp cDNA fragment that encodes a partial C-terminal peptide composed of 173 amino acids (48L21) (Fig.1 A). To obtain a cDNA sequence for the N-terminal portion, we performed PCR using UT7/TPO cDNA and primers from the 5′-terminal sequence of the cloning site of pAD-Gal4 (5′-AGGGATGTTTAATACCACTAC-3′) and the 5′-terminal sequence of the 48L21 (5′-GCTGTTGTACACGGAGTGCA-3′). A 400-bp cDNA fragment (5′-48L21) was amplified, and the nucleotide sequencing revealed the sequence was continuous to the 5′-terminus of 48L21. For the final cloning of a full-length cDNA, PCR with UT7/TPO cDNA and primers from the 5′-terminal sequence of 5′-48L21 (5′-TGCGCCTGGGCGCGAAAATG-3′) and 3′-terminal sequence of 48L21 (5′-GGCTCTGGGTGCCATCCTGT-3′) was performed. Nucleotide sequencing of the amplified PCR product (1.3-kb cDNA fragment) revealed that the protein was composed of 410 amino acids. Subsequent data base searches indicated that the sequence was identical with the short isoform of Aup1 (Refs. 20Jang W. Weber J.S. Bashir R. Bushby K. Meisler M.H.

Northern blot analysis with the total RNA extracted from UT7/TPO cells using a full-length Aup1 cDNA probe revealed a transcript of ∼1.7 kb (Fig.2 A). Because it was reported that Aup1 is expressed in all mouse tissues (20Jang W. Weber J.S. Bashir R. Bushby K. Meisler M.H. Genomics. 1996; 36: 366-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we examined the expression of Aup1 transcripts in various human tissues. In concordance with the mouse tissues, Aup1 was expressed in all human tissues examined (Fig. 2 B). To examine the expression of the Aup1 protein in UT7-TPO cells, platelets, leukocytes, and other cell lines, a rabbit antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide for Aup1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Immunoblot analysis using this antiserum (Aup1–2) revealed duplicate bands of ∼40 kDa at the reducing as well as non-reducing conditions in UT7/TPO cells (Fig.3 A). These bands were observed in other cell lines including CMK, HL60, K562, U937, Jurkat, Raji, HepG2, 293, HeLa, MCF7, and A547 (Fig. 3 B). Treatment with the protein phosphatases did not change intensity of these two bands (data not shown). In contrast, only a smaller band was detected in platelets and leukocytes (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3Expression of Aup1 protein in human cells. A, protein (150 μg) extracted from UT7/TPO cells were probed with a preimmune rabbit serum (lane 1), a rabbit antiserum for Aup1 (Aup1–2) (lane 2), and Aup1–2 with a synthetic Aup1 peptide (80 nm) (lane 3). Duplicate bands disappeared when an Aup1 peptide was added to the Aup1–2 antiserum, indicating that Aup1–2 recognizes the peptide sequence (lane 3). Protein size markers (kDa) are presented. B, protein extracts (150 μg) from human cell lines including 293 (lane 1), MCF7 (lane 2), A549 (lane 3), HeLa (lane 4), HepG2 (lane 5), Jurkat (lane 6), Raji (lane 7), U937 (lane 8), K562 (lane 9), HL 60 (lane 10), CMK (lane 11), and UT7/TPO (lane 12) were probed with Aup1–2. β-actin; filters were reprobed with an anti-β actin antibody (Sigma).C, protein extracts from UT7/TPO cells (150 μg,lanes 1 and 2), platelets (100 μg,lanes 3 and 4), and leukocytes (125 μg, lanes 5 and 6) were probed with a preimmune rabbit serum (lanes 1, 3, and 5) and Aup1–2 (lanes 2,4, and 6). Arrowheads indicate Aup1. Although duplicate bands of ∼40 kDa were observed in cell lines, only a smaller band was detected in platelets and leukocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the subcellular localization of Aup1, stable UT7/TPO cell lines that express the Aup1-RFP fusion protein (UT7/TPO.Aup1R23-1) and the control RFP (UT7/TPO.VR4-4) were established. Overexpression of Aup1 did not affect the expression of αIIbβ3 on the cellular surface, as confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of UT7/TPO, UT7/TPO.VR4-4, and UT7/TPO.Aup1R23-1 cells (data not shown). Observation of UT7/TPO.VR4-4 and UT7/TPO.Aup1 R23-1 cells by confocal microscopy revealed that RFP was distributed evenly throughout the cell; however, the Aup1-RFP fusion protein was observed in the cytoplasm, but not in the nucleus (Fig. 4). Because it was reported that the N terminus of mouse Aup1 resembles the signal peptide of secreted protein, followed by a putative signal cleavage site, we examined whether Aup1 is secreted from cells. Immunoblot analysis with the culture supernatant of UT7/TPO cells using the Aup1–2 antiserum revealed that Aup1 could not be detected in the concentrated (10-fold) culture supernatant (data not shown). These results indicate that Aup1 is a cytoplasmic protein. To examine whether Aup1 is associated with the αIIb cytoplasmic tail in the eukaryotic cells, UT7-TPO cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with the Aup1–2 antiserum. Immunoblot analysis with the precipitates using anti-αIIband -β3 antibodies indicated that Aup1 bound to the αIIb, but not to the β3 subunit (Fig.5 A). We then measured how much of the cellular αIIb subunit is complexed with Aup1 by the immunodepletion assay. Densitometric analysis of the resulting αIIb bands with the supernatants of the UT7-TPO cell lysate after immunoprecipitation with the Aup1–2 and the control rabbit serum revealed that 41.7 ± 3.2% (mean ± S.D., results from three independent experiments) of the αIIbsubunit was complexed with Aup1 (data not shown). Binding of Aup1 to the αIIb cytoplasmic tail was confirmed by the GST pull-down assay, revealing that GST-tagged Aup1 binds to the αIIb, but not to the β3 subunit (Fig.5 B). We next studied interaction between the synthetic peptide for the αIIb cytoplasmic tail and immobilized GST-Aup1 fusion protein to measure the affinity of interaction. TheK d value calculated from the Scatchard plot analysis was 90 μm, suggesting a relatively weak affinity of interaction between Aup1 and the αIIb cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 6). As Aup1 is expressed ubiquitously in human cells and tissues, we examined whether Aup1 binds to cytoplasmic tails of other integrin α as wel"
https://openalex.org/W1992475933,"Ntg2p is a DNAN-glycosylase/apurinic or apyrimidinic lyase involved in base excision repair of oxidatively damaged DNA inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen and a GST in vitro transcription and translation assay, the mismatch repair (MMR) protein Mlh1p was demonstrated to interact physically with Ntg2p. The Mlh1p binding site maps to amino acids residues 15–40 of Ntg2p. The Ntg2p binding site is localized in the C-terminal end (483–769) of Mlh1p. Overproduction of Ntg2p results in a mutator phenotype with enhanced frameshift reversion frequency, suggesting partial inhibition of the MMR pathway. In contrast, inactivation of NTG2 does not enhance mutagenesis, indicating that Ntg2p is not required for MMR. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Mlh1p binding domain of Ntg2p revealed three amino acids (Ser24, Tyr26, Phe27) that are absolutely required for Ntg2p-Mlh1p interaction. These residues are part of a motif found in Ntg2p (Arg23-Ser24-Lys25-Tyr26-Phe27), Exo1p (Arg444-Ser445-Lys446-Phe447-Phe448), and Sgs1p (Lys1383-Ser1384-Lys1385-Phe1386-Phe1387). In these three proteins, the motif is part of the domain that interacts with the C-terminal end of Mlh1p. Furthermore, S445A, F447A, and F448A mutants of Exo1p do not bind Mlh1p, but the wild type Exo1p does. Therefore, we propose that the R/K-S-R/K-Y/F-Y/F sequence could define a Mhl1 binding motif. The results also suggest that base excision repair and MMR can cooperate to prevent deleterious effects of oxidative DNA damage.

It results from the attack of base and sugar moieties by reactive oxygen species generated by cellular metabolism or exogenous agents. Reactive oxygen species can induce several types of lesions in DNA, such as oxidized bases, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)1 sites and strand breakage (4Dizdaroglu M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 10: 225-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 5Cadet J. Berger M. Douki T. Ravanat J.L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 131: 1-87PubMed Google Scholar). To prevent the deleterious action of oxidative DNA damage, organisms have developed robust DNA repair mechanisms. Reactive oxygen species-induced lesions in DNA bases are primarily repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. BER is a ubiquitous DNA repair process that is initiated by a DNA N-glycosylase removing the altered or unusual bases. Two classes of DNAN-glycosylases are present in the cell: the monofunctional enzymes catalyzing the removal of the lesion, leaving an AP site in DNA; and the DNA N-glycosylases/AP lyases catalyzing both cleavage of the N-glycosylic bond and of the phosphodiester bond 3′ to the newly formed AP site (6Sun B.

Res. 1997; 383: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The next step in the course of BER is catalyzed by an AP endonuclease generating a single strand break with a 3′-OH end that can be used as a substrate by a DNA polymerase. Finally, BER is completed by successive action of a DNA polymerase and a DNA ligase (8Friedberg E. Walker G. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.

Recently, it has been reported that anntg1 ntg2 double mutant strain is not unusually sensitive to H2O2, nor does it exhibit a mutator phenotype (15Swanson R.L. Morey N.J. Doetsch P.W. Jinks-Robertson S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2929-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 21Gellon L. Barbey R. Auffret van der Kemp P. Thomas D. Boiteux S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 265: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, a ntg1 ntg2 rad14triple mutant exhibits a mutator phenotype and enhanced sensitivity to the lethal effect of chemical oxidants compared with that of a wild type strain (21Gellon L. Barbey R. Auffret van der Kemp P. Thomas D. Boiteux S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 265: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results show that oxidatively damaged pyrimidines are not only removed by BER enzymes such as Ntg1p and Ntg2p but also by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. It was demonstrated recently that the Apn1p can also incise DNA on the 5′-side of various oxidatively damaged bases (22Ischenko A.A. Saparbaev M.K. Nature. 2002; 415: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). On the other hand, inactivation of the Ogg1p results in a spontaneous GC to TA mutator phenotype, which is probably caused by the accumulation of 8-oxoG in DNA (23Thomas D. Scot A.D. Barbey R. Padula M. Boiteux S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 24Bruner S.D. Nash H.M. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, recent studies strongly suggest that the mutagenic action of endogenous oxidative DNA damage is also counteracted by the mismatch repair pathway (MMR) (25Earley M.C. Crouse G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15487-15491Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Ni T.T. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R.D. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 12468-12473Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). A genetic analysis showed that reversion rates for three classes of base substitutions are greatly enhanced in yeast strains deficient in Msh2p or Msh6p; however, when cells are grown anaerobically, the reversion rates for these base substitutions, in those strains, are strongly reduced (25Earley M.C. Crouse G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15487-15491Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, ogg1 msh2 and ogg1 msh6double mutants exhibit a synergistic increase in GC to TA spontaneous transversions compared with the ogg1, msh2, and msh6 single mutants (26Ni T.T. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 439-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These last results suggest that MMR eliminates adenine residues incorporated opposite 8-oxoG (26Ni T.T. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 439-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). MMR could also remove 8-oxoG incorporated by a DNA polymerase using 8-oxo-dGTP as a precursor in the course of DNA replication. Therefore, MMR could be the functional homolog in S. cerevisiae of the bacterial MutY and MutT (26Ni T.T. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 439-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 29Mazurek A. Berardini M. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8260-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results show that in S. cerevisiae, BER, NER, and MMR pathways are involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage and therefore cooperate to prevent its deleterious action. The cooperation of these different pathways could be mediated by protein-protein interactions. To explore this avenue, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the full-length Ntg2p as bait and a library of genomic DNA fragments of S. cerevisiae as a source of potential protein partners. In this report, we demonstrate that Ntg2p specifically interacts with the MMR protein Mlh1p. In addition, overexpression of Ntg2p leads to a MMR mutator phenotype, whereas deletion of NTG2 has no effect on MMR. Finally, we could determine the presence of an Mlh1p interaction motif in partners of Mlh1p such as Ntg2p, Sgs1p, and Exo1p. Microbiological techniques and media used in this study have been described by Miller (30Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) and Sherman (31Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) for E. coli and S. cerevisiae, respectively. Bacterial strains DH5α and JM105 were used for plasmid construction and preparation (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid tests were performed in strain Y190 (MATa gal4 gal80 his3 trp1–901 ade2–101 ura3–52 leu2–3, 112 URA3::GAL1::lacZ LYS2::GAL4(UAS)::HIS3 cyhR) (33Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N.

Deletion mutants ofMLH1, PMS1, MSH2, NTG2, and EXO1 were constructed by the PCR-mediated one-step replacement technique using the kanMX module (34Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A.

Yeast two-hybrid plasmid vectors are pGBT9 (37Bartel P. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar) and pAS2ΔΔ (38Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) yielding bait constructs and pACT2 for prey constructs. Bait constructs express Gal4pDBD(DNA Binding Domain) C-terminal fusion proteins. Prey constructs express Gal4pAD(Activation Domain) C-terminal fusion proteins. Plasmids pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) were used for GST-in vitrotranscription-translation (IVTT) assays. Plasmid PTRC99a (AmershamBiosciences) was used to express and purify full-length Ntg2p and truncated Ntg2p(31–380). Finally, pYX212 (R&D) was used to express native Ntg2p. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Sequences of plasmids, construction schemes, and oligonucleotide primers are available upon request. Point mutations were performed by PCR-mediated mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene). Alanine substitutions at the N-terminal end of Ntg2p are generated using pAS2ΔΔ-NTG2 as target and specific primers. The plasmid expressing Gal4pDBD-Ntg2p(1–20) was constructed by changing Gln21/Val22/Arg23 of Ntg2p into three stop codons. The plasmid expressing Gal4pAD-Mlh1p(1–731) was constructed by changing Glu732/His733/Val734 into stop codons. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Sequences of plasmids, construction schemes, and oligonucleotides primers are available upon request. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed with the FRYL genomic library (38Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) containing randomly sheared genomic DNA fragments of 700 bp mean size in a modified pACT2 vector. The library DNA was purified by ultracentrifugation in a CsCl gradient to transform strain Y190 containing the Gal4pDBD-Ntg2p bait fusion. Transformed cells were plated directly onto 100 μg/ml SD adenine minimal medium plates containing 25 or 50 mm 3-aminotriazole to select His+ colonies. Colonies growing after 4–7 days were streaked on SD + adenine + histidine and assayed for β-galactosidase production in an overlay plate assay. Blue colonies were restreaked on the same medium and tested again for β-galactosidase production. Among more than 1.1 × 107 transformants tested for histidine prototrophy and positive β-galactosidase assays, positive clones were selected. Prey plasmid DNA was recovered and transformed in E. coli strain 1066 (trpC-9830 leuB-6 pyrF-74::Tn5Δ(lac I POZYA)-74 galU galK hsdR rpsL) selecting the yeast LEU2 marker. Alternatively, we prepared total yeast DNA by using a QIAamp kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), amplified the prey DNA by PCR, and purified the product on a QIAquick column. After sequencing, the identity of the insert was determined by using the S. cerevisiae Genome Data base Blast service (genome-www2.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/SGD/nph-blast2sgd). β-Galactosidase liquid assays were performed by resuspending cells in 1 ml of Z buffer with 0.8 mg of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside substrate plus chloroform and SDS. Reaction were stopped with Na2CO3 when an appropriate level of color had developed, and β-galactosidase activity was measured (30Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The average and S.D. of at least three independent experiments are presented. GST and GST-Ntg2p were expressed in E. coli JM105 harboring a pGEX4T-1 or pGEX-NTG2, respectively. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB broth medium (1 liter) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, until theA600 = 0.7 and induced for 16 h at 20 °C in the presence of 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were collected and stored at –80 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended into 10 ml/g lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.8 μg/ml antipain, 0.8 μg/ml leupeptine, 0.8 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell suspensions were sonicated and centrifuged at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline buffer and applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline buffer for 1 h at room temperature under gentle continuous agitation. [35S]Methionine-labeled Mlh1p was prepared by IVTT of pBluescript II KS-MLH1 using a TNT-coupled lysate system (Promega) and [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). 35 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled Mlh1p was added to equivalent amounts of GST or GST-Ntg2p bound to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in 200 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa2EDTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C on a rotator. Beads were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa2EDTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Beads were pelleted and resuspended in denaturing loading buffer, boiled, and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, and imaged using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Wild type cells containing the Gal4pDBD-tagged baits were grown in selective medium to exponential phase before extraction. Yeast extracts were prepared as described by Vialard et al. (39Vialard J.E. Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5679-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) by glass bead beating in 20% trichloroacetic acid, washing the glass beads in 5% trichloroacetic acid, and combining the wash with the lysate. The protein suspension was then pelleted, resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer (pH 8.8), boiled for 5 min, pelleted, and the supernatant was retained as a whole cell extract. For Western blotting, proteins were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by electroblotting (Bio-Rad). Monoclonal antibody raised against Gal4pDBD(CLONTECH) was incubated with the nitrocellulose membranes as recommended in the manufacturer's protocol. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (AmershamBiosciences) was incubated for 1 h at a 1:10,000 dilution, and the blot was revealed by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The 34-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide used in this study was 5′-GGCTTCATCGTTATC(DHT)CTGACCTGGTGGATACCG-3′. DHT represents a site-specifically incorporated 5,6-dihydrothymidine residue. The DHT-containing strand was 32P-labeled at the 5′-end and annealed with a complementary strand containing an adenine opposite DHT as described (40D'Ham C. Romieu A. Jaquinod M. Gasparutto D. Cadet J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3335-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Crude extract was obtained from yeast Y190-harboring plasmids expressing wild type or mutant Gal4pDBD-Ntg2p as described by Thomas et al. (23Thomas D. Scot A.D. Barbey R. Padula M. Boiteux S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In a standard reaction (20-μl final volume), 50 fmol of32P-labeled DHT·A duplex was incubated in reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mmNa2EDTA) with cell-free protein extracts (3.5 μg of protein). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by adding 5 μl of formamide dye and subjected to 7 m urea and 20% PAGE as described by Girard et al. (41Girard P.M. D'Ham C. Cadet J. Boiteux S. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Gels were scanned and band intensities quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methylformamidopyrimide (Me-FapyG)-containing DNA was also used as substrate. For the Me-FapyG DNA N-glycosylase activity assay, [3H]Me-FapyG-poly(dG-dC) was prepared as described (42Boiteux S. Belleney J. Roques B.P. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Full-length Ntg2p was purified to homogeneity as described previously (13Senturker S. Auffret van der Kemp P. You H.J. Doetsch P.W. Dizdaroglu M. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5270-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The same strategy was used to purify truncated Ntg2p(31–380). The assay mixture (100 μl) was composed of 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, [3H]Me-FapyG-poly(dG-dC), and purified protein. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min, and the ethanol-soluble radioactive material was quantitated. Spontaneous reversion of the hom3–10 or lys2-Bgl locus and forward mutation to canavanine resistance (CanR), were measured. At least 10 independent yeast cultures were started from about 103 viable cells and grown to stationary phase in liquid YPAD medium or YNBD medium supplemented with required base or amino acids. Cells were plated after appropriate dilution or concentration onto selective medium plates lacking threonine or lysine for Hom+ and Lys+ revertants or containing 60 μg/ml l-canavanine for CanR mutants. Plates were incubated for 3–5 days at 30 °C before counting. Spontaneous mutant frequencies were calculated by dividing the revertant or mutant count by the viable cell count. Values were determined by the method of the median (43Lea D.E. Coulson C.A. J. Genet. 1949; 49: 264-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). S.D. values were calculated, and the 95% confidence interval was applied by using PRISM 2.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego). Using full-length Ntg2p (Fig.1A) as bait in a two-hybrid screen of 1.1 × 107 transformants, 15 positive colonies were selected and analyzed by sequencing. The three strongest interactions, based on the early appearance of colonies on (His− + 3-aminotriazole) plates and on the intensity of color in the X-gal overlay plate assay, were found to match two fragments of the C-terminal end (402–769) and (483–769), from the MMR protein, Mlh1p (Fig. 1, B and C). Interestingly, the C-terminal end of Mlh1p also interacts with Pms1p, Mlh2p, Mlh3p, Exo1p, or Sgs1p in two-hybrid assays (44Pang Q. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4465-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 45Wang T.F. Kleckner N. Hunter N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 9760-9765Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because the Mlh1p preys were truncated, it was important to test the ability of full-length Mlh1p to interact with Ntg2p. Fig. 1, B and C, shows that the full-length Mlh1p interacts with Ntg2p in a two-hybrid assay as well as the truncated Mlh1p(483–769) does. Because Ntg2p and Ntg1p present a high degree of similarity, we also performed a two-hybrid assay with full-length Ntg1p as bait and full-length Mlh1p as prey. Fig. 1B shows that Ntg1p does not interact with Mlh1p by two-hybrid assay. We also constructed a Mlh1p(1–731) mutant with its 38 last amino acids deleted and tested it for interaction with the full-length Ntg2p by the two-hybrid system. Fig. 1Cshows that the Mlh1p(1–731) does not interact with Ntg2p. Control experiments show that neither Ntg2p bait nor full-length or truncated Mlh1p preys alone stimulate reporter gene expression"
https://openalex.org/W1488926056,"We have recently reported the molecular cloning of a gene, gspK, in Vibrio cholerae that encodes a specific glucosamine kinase. We describe here the identification of bglA, a gene contiguous togspK in a presumptive large chitin catabolic operon.BglA was molecularly cloned into Escherichia coli, and the protein BglA was overexpressed and purified to apparent homogeneity. BglA is 65 kDa (574 amino acids) with an N-terminal amino acid sequence predicted by the gene sequence, suggesting that the enzyme is cytoplasmic. The purified enzyme exhibited optimal activity with p-nitrophenyl β-glucoside, cellobiose, and higher oligosaccharides of cellulose. No other glucosides or glycosides tested were hydrolyzed, including Glc-Glc disaccharides where the linkage is β1→2, β1→3, and β1→6, respectively. The predicted BglA sequence bears little similarity to other proteins in the data banks. The Henrissat algorithm places BglA sequence in Family 9 of the glycosidases, suggesting it is an endoglucanase. However, the results summarized above suggested that BglA is an exoenzyme yielding Glc at each cleavage step. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, detailed kinetic studies were conducted with cellotetraose. Only exoglucanase activity was detected. The function of this enzyme in V. cholerae remains to be determined, especially because our strain of this organism does not utilize cellobiose.

Chitin is composed of β1,4-N-acetylglucosamine residues in place of the Glc residues in cellulose. Chitinases and cellulases are widespread in nature, and many have been isolated from a variety of organisms. We have previously reported that the chitin catabolic cascade in the marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii comprises several signal transduction pathways and many proteins (summarized in Ref. 1Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 108-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The complete genomic sequence of Vibrio cholerae has been published recently (2Heidelberg J.F. Eisen J.A. Nelson W.C. Clayton R.A. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Umayam L. Gill S.R. Nelson K.E. Read T.D. Tettelin H. Richardson D. Ermolaeva M.D. Vamathevan J. Bass S.

Nature. 2000; 406: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar), and virtually all of the genes that we have cloned and sequenced from V. furnissii encode proteins that show great identity/similarity to the comparable proteins from V. cholerae. Therefore, V. cholerae will be the organism of choice for our future studies on chitin catabolism. Among the familyVibrionaceae, V. cholerae is probably the most significant with respect to human health and disease. It is a Gram-negative bacterium that resides in brackish waters and seawater where it is closely associated with copepods, ubiquitous marine microcrustacea that provide a major source of chitin for these bacteria. Among the unique genes and proteins that we have characterized fromV. furnissii, we identified three enzymes, (GlcNAc)2 phosphorylase (3Park J.K. Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33077-33083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Exo I, and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (4Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33425-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and a specific glucosamine kinase (5Park J.K. Wang L.-X. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15573-15578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The three genes are part of what we believe is a (GlcNAc)2 catabolic operon comprising 10 genes in V. cholerae, and our goal is to fully characterize the other seven genes and proteins. We report here the molecular cloning of a gene, bglA (1.7 kilobases) from the putative operon. In the data banks, it is annotated as an endoglucanase-like glycohydrolase. As shown below, the protein BglA (65 kDa) is a β-1,4-d-glucosidase, more specifically, a cellobiase. The following chemicals, reagents, and materials were purchased from the indicated sources. Cellulose, chitin, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and p-nitrophenyl (pNP)1 glycosides were from Sigma. Chitin oligosaccharides and (GlcNAc)n(n = 2–5) were from Seikagaku America, Inc. Reagents for bacterial media were from Difco and J. T. Baker.pNP-β-glucoside-6-phosphate was kindly provided by Dr. John Thompson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Reagents for molecular biology were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Stratagene, and U. S. Biochemical Corporation. A glucose assay kit was purchased from Sigma. Other buffers and reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. V. cholerae E1 Tor N16961 is the strain used for obtaining the DNA sequences of the two chromosomes (2Heidelberg J.F.

These and Escherichia coli strains BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) and XL1-Blue (Stratagene) harboring designated plasmid constructs were stored as frozen cultures in Luria Broth (LB) medium with 5% glycerol. Typically, E. coli strains were grown overnight in LB medium plus appropriate antibiotics with vigorous shaking. Fresh medium was inoculated with cells from the overnight culture at a 1:20 dilution, and this culture was grown to the desired density at either a midexponential or stationary phase as specified. DNA preparations, restriction enzyme digests, ligation, and transformations were performed using standard techniques (6Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Curr. Prot. Mol. Biol. 1996; : 1-3Google Scholar). The β-1,4-d-glucosidase gene, bglA, was amplified by PCR using synthetic primers based on the complete sequence of gene VC0615 in the chromosomal DNA of V. cholerae. The 5′-PCR primer was designed containing aNdeI restriction site to facilitate cloning into the start site following a T7 promoter in the overexpression vector pET21a (Novagen, Madison, WI). The primers used to construct the overexpression plasmid were (1Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 108-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) 5′-AGAAAACATATGCTGTTACTGACCAA-3′ and (2Heidelberg J.F. Eisen J.A. Nelson W.C. Clayton R.A. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H.

Nierman W.C. White O. Nature. 2000; 406: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar) 5′-GCAAAGCTTATTCGATAACTCAT-3′. The amplified PCR fragment (1.7 kilobases) corresponding to bglA was transferred into pET21a predigested with both NdeI (5′ end) and Hind III (3′ end). The constructed vector, pET:bglA, was transformed into the T7 polymerase-inducible host strain BL21 (DE3) for the overexpression of the protein product. Protein concentration was measured by using a Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Enzyme assays were conducted at 37 °C, and in all assays, product formation was proportional to the time of incubation and the quantity of the enzyme. Control incubation mixtures lacked enzyme, contained heat-denatured enzyme, or lacked substrate. No activity was observed with these negative controls. In kinetic studies with the purified enzyme, the mixtures contained 0.1–0.5 μg of BglA unless specified otherwise. Cell extracts or protein fractions to be assayed were adjusted to 100-μl volumes with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and mixed with 100 μl of the same buffer containing 5 mmpNP-β-glucoside. Routine assays were conducted at 37 °C taking 3–4 time points from 0–0.5 h. The reaction was quenched with 900 μl of 1 m Tris base, pH 11, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. The quantity ofp-nitrophenol produced per minute was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 18,300 m·cm−1. A discontinuous assay was also used for determining the kinetics of hydrolysis of the cellooligosaccharides Glcn (n= 2–5) and to test other α- or β-glucosides. The product Glc was quantitated with a glucose oxidase kit (Sigma). The reaction mixture (200 μl) contained 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and 5 mm sugar substrates, or other concentrations as specified. The reactions were initiated by adding BglA (0.5–4.0 μg), incubated at 37 °C over a time course (typically 0–1 h), and heated at 100 °C for 3 min. The glucose assay reagent (400 μl) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 37 °C for exactly 30 min, and 400 μl of 12 n H2SO4 were added. The absorbance of the mixture versus the reagent blank was measured at 540 nm. A standard curve was obtained with each set of the analyses containing Glc in an incubation mixture lacking BglA. In the mixtures containing glycosides or oligosaccharides of GlcNAc, product formation was determined by the Morgan-Elson method (7Morgan W. Elson L. Biochem. J. 1934; 28: 988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for free GlcNAc. To 0.15 ml of 3 mmcellotetraose in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, were added 15 μl of homogeneous enzyme (45 μg), and the mixture incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 60 min, and after 12 h. The aliquots were heated at 100 °C to stop the reaction and diluted to 150 μl with water. Generally, 20 of 150 μl of aliquots were injected into the ion-exchange column. The mixture was analyzed by HPAEC (8Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) using a Dionex DX600 chromatography system (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, California) equipped with an electrochemical detector (ED50). The column was CarboPac-PA (4 × 250 mm), and the eluants were (a) 0.1m NaOH and (b) 1 m sodium acetate in 0.1 m NaOH. The flow rate of the column was set at 1 ml/min, and the gradients were as follows: 5% B for 0–4 min; 5–20% B from 4–8 min; and 20% B from 8–15 min or longer. The standards, Glc, and cellooligosaccharides eluted as sharp well resolved peaks at the following times (in min): Glc, 3.15; (Glc)2, 5.7; (Glc)3, 9.1; (Glc)4, 10.1; and (Glc)5, 10.6. The quantity of each sugar was determined from the area under the corresponding peak where the PED response, i.e. the area, was calibrated by injecting standard samples of the corresponding sugar. The cellotetraose substrate was ∼5% contaminated with cellotriose, and a suitable correction was made for this contaminant in the value for G3 detected in the hydrolysate. The kinetic data points for Fig. 4 were fitted by a program available on the Internet, KYPlot. The modeling of the reaction sequence and simulations of the progress curves for Fig. 5 were conducted likewise with a computer program, KinTekSim.FIG. 5Simulation of the progress curve from 0–20 min incubation. The results shown in Fig. 4 were modeled according to the simple stepwise hydrolysis scheme (see “Discussion”). The 0–20-min incubation (Fig. 4B) is shown as an example. Thelines give the results of the modeling program. The fit to the data points suggests that the model is correct, and that the enzyme is a simple exoglucosidase that hydrolyzes each of the substrates (G4, G3, G2) at about the same rate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In some cases, the course of the hydrolysis was also followed by subjecting aliquots of the incubation mixture to thin layer chromatography on HPTLC Silica Gel 60 plates (EM Scientific) using the following solvent mixture: n-butanol, methanol, ammonium hydroxide, and water, 5:4:2:1 (v/v). This procedure separated cellulose oligosaccharides Glc through Glc5. The oligosaccharides Glc5 were detected by spraying the plate with 3% cupric acetate, 8% phosphoric acid followed by heating on a hot plate at 100 °C for 20 min followed by 200 °C until the compounds charred and the spots were visible. A single colony of E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) harboring pET:bglA was inoculated in 200 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C with aeration. Two liters each of LB medium supplemented with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) in two 6-liters flasks were inoculated with 50 ml of the overnight culture and allowed to grow at 37 °C with aeration until the absorbance at 600 nm = 3.0. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. The cell pellet (8.5 g) was washed twice with 800 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and finally resuspended in 32 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. The cells were disrupted by two passages through a Wabash French pressure. Non-lysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h. Nucleic acids were precipitated using streptomycin sulfate (160 μl of 10% stock solution/ml crude extract) added dropwise with stirring. The mixture was stirred for an additional 45 min and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant of Step 2 was treated with saturated ammonium sulfate solution added dropwise with stirring to a final concentration of 55%. After stirring overnight, the suspension was centrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 1 h. The ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.0, and dialyzed against the same buffer. The 55% ammonium sulfate fraction was transferred to a 200-ml DEAE-Sepharose fast-flow column equilibrated with the phosphate, NaCl buffer of Step 3. After transferring the sample to the column, it was washed with 500 ml of the same buffer, and a gradient (700 ml) from 0.15 m NaCl to 1.2 m NaCl in the phosphate buffer was applied to elute the column. The activity eluted between 0.4 and 0.5 m NaCl. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.2 mNaCl. The pooled sample from Step 4 was transferred to an immobilized Zn2+ affinity column (20-ml bed volume, Amersham Biosciences) that had first been equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.2 m NaCl. The column was then eluted with a gradient of 0–0.5 m imidazole in the same buffer. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 10 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA followed by the same buffer without EDTA. Purity was monitored throughout the fractionation by SDS-PAGE and enzyme activity (Table 1). The purified enzyme was stored in small aliquots with dithiothreitol (0.5 mm, final concentration) at −20 or −80 °C. The activity was stable under these conditions.Table IPurification of recombinant BglA from E. coli BL21(DE3)StepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationmgunits1-aActivity measured with PNP β-glucoside in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at 37 °C.

Open table in a new tab The N-terminal amino acid residues of purified recombinant BglA were determined by Dr. Robert Cole using an Applied Biosystems 475A protein sequencer (Amino Acid Sequencing Facility, Dept. of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). The effects of these parameters on enzyme activity were studied with the purified enzyme at 37 °C to determine the optimal conditions for kinetic characterization. The substrate concentrations of 2.5 mmpNP-Glc or cellobiose were used. The following buffer systems were employed: citrate (pH 3.0∼6.5), imidazole (pH 6.5–7.7), TAPS (pH 7.7–9.0), and glycine-NaOH (pH 8.5–10.0). Where possible, overlapping pH ranges were used with different buffers. The effect of ionic strength on enzyme activity was determined using 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, supplemented with 0–2.0 m NaCl or KCl. Activity was determined as described above. The optimum temperature and thermal stability of the enzyme were investigated usingpNP-glucoside or cellobiose as the substrate. The optimum temperature was determined by incubating reaction mixtures as described above over a temperature range of 0–70 °C. Thermal stability of the enzyme (0.5–3.0 μg) was measured in 100 μl of buffer by incubating at the desired temperature for 30 min, cooling to room temperature, and then initiating the reactions by the addition of the substrate. The formation of p-nitrophenol or free glucose was determined as described above. The genomic sequence of V. cholerae was employed to design primers for subcloning the bglA gene into the pET21a overexpression vector, yielding pET:bglA. The vector was used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3). Fig.1 shows that the protein BglA was expressed at a high level in these cells. The enzyme was purified ∼10-fold from the crude extract in approximately a 25% yield, giving an apparently homogeneous protein (Fig. 1). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified recombinant protein was MLLLTNHIGTET. This sequence is identical to the N terminus predicted by the nucleotide sequence of the gene. The gene sequence also predicts that BglA contains 574 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 65 kDa (Fig. 1). A search of various data banks with the BglA sequence has not shown significant similarities with other proteins but indicates that BglA is a member of glycosyl hydrolase Family 9, which consists of a variety of endoglucanases and explains why it has been annotated a “cellodextrinase” in theV. cholerae genome (2Heidelberg J.F. Eisen J.A. Nelson W.C. Clayton R.A. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Umayam L. Gill S.R. Nelson K.E. Read T.D. Tettelin H. Richardson D. Ermolaeva M.D. Vamathevan J. Bass S.

Two types of substrates were used to define the optimal conditions for measuring the activity of the enzyme, pNP-β-Glc and cellobiose. p-Nitrophenol was measured spectrophotometrically, and Glc liberated from cellobiose was assayed with glucose oxidase. Fig. 2A shows that the rate of hydrolysis of pNP-Glc was constant with a time of incubation for at least 30 min, indicating that neither product, p-nitrophenol nor more importantly Glc, inhibited the enzyme at the low concentrations formed under these conditions. The kinetic modeling results described below suggest that high concentrations of Glc do inhibit the enzyme. End product inhibition has been observed with some glycohydrolases. Activity was determined as a function of pH, ionic strength, and temperature as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The pH optimum of the purified recombinant enzyme was between 6.0–6.5. At the pH optimum, NaCl and KCl gave similar results with an optimum at 10 mm, and the enzyme retained 75% of its activity in 0.5m salt. The purified enzyme retained greater than 90% of its activity in 20 mm EDTA or EGTA. Purified BglA displayed a temperature optimum from 37 to 42 °C. The enzyme was stable for at least 1 h from 4–37 °C. The incubation at 40 and 70 °C for 3 h in dilute solution and in the absence of potential protective agents such as albumin or dithiothreitol resulted in 40 and 100% loss of enzyme activity, respectively. Fig. 2B shows the rate versussubstrate concentration for pNP-glucoside. Kinetic parameters for pNP-glucoside were calculated from Woolf-Augustinsson-Hofstee (v versus v/[S]) plots (9Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1976Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, the kinetic constants were found to beKm = 0.45 mm and Vmax = 0.34 nmol/min/μg. Similar studies with cellobiose showed again that the rate of hydrolysis was constant with time of incubation and proportional to protein concentration. Fig. 3Ashows the effect of cellobiose concentration on the rate of glucose formation, and Fig. 3B shows the Woolf-Augustinsson-Hofstee plot. The calculated kinetic parameters for cellobiose wereKm = 6.96 mm and Vmax = 1.60 nmol/min/μg. Normally, the aryl glycosides are hydrolyzed more rapidly by glycosidases than the corresponding alkyl glycosides or oligosaccharides, but in this case, the Vmax(and the kcat) for cellobiose was 4.7-fold greater than that for pNP-glucoside. However, there is a compensating effect because of the differences in Km for the two substrates. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the enzyme for the two substrates were approximately 45 and 13.7 forpNP-Glc and cellobiose, respectively. The enzyme was also active with the higher β1→4 Glc-linked oligosaccharides, cellotriose, cellotetraose, and cellopentaose. At 1 mm concentrations, pH 6.5, at 37 °C, the rate of Glc formation from these oligomers was around the same as that observed with cellobiose. Attempts to obtain interpretable kinetic data were hampered by the fact that in addition to Glc, the product of each reaction was also a substrate for the enzyme. pNP was released from pNP-cellobioside, but this came only after a lag period completely unlike the kinetics of hydrolysis of pNP-Glc, which proceeds rapidly with no lag. An analysis of the pNP-cellobioside/BglA incubation mixtures by TLC indicated that Glc and pNP-Glc were the first products of the reaction. The pNP was apparently released from the first hydrolysis product, PNP-Glc. This result is discussed below. The enzyme displayed no activity toward any other α or β sugar substrate tested including di(N-acetylglucosamine) (GlcNAc)2, chitobiose (GlcN)2, chitin oligosaccharides (GlcNAc)n (n = 3∼5), trehalose, lactose, maltose, and sucrose. More importantly, it exhibited no activity with positional isomers of cellobiose: sophorose (β1→2), laminaribiose (β1→3), and gentiobiose (β1→6). No activity was detected withpNP-β-GalNAc, pNP-β-glucose-6-phosphate, or with pNP-(GlcNAc)n (n = 1–3). The data bank lists gene VC0615 as encoding an endoglucanase-related protein, and the CAZy (carbohydrate-active enzymes) (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼cazy/cazy/index.html) algorithm of Henrissat and co-workers (10Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar, 11Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar, 12Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar) places this enzyme in Family 9 of the glycohydrolases. This large family comprises endoglucanases primarily of the cellulase type. The characterized enzymes do not hydrolyze cellobiose nor yield Glc as an end product. In fact, many of them produce cellobiose as an end product. The kinetic studies summarized above suggest that VC0165 encodes an exoglucosidase, i.e. specifically a β1,4-glucosidase. One possible explanation for the incongruity between our results and the assignment based on sequence is the statement made in the latest update of CAZy that “some glycoside hydrolases are multifunctional enzymes that contain catalytic domains that belong to different GH families.” In other words, perhaps BglA is both an exoglucanase and endoglucanase. To resolve this question, more extensive kinetic studies were conducted with cellotetraose. The expected products are the monosaccharides, disaccharides, and trisaccharides, but the relative rates at which they appear kinetically could answer the question raised above. An ion-exchange method was developed using HPAEC as described under “Experimental Procedures” to determine these potential intermediates quantitatively. The standards were well resolved, and the areas under the peaks were used for quantitation following calibration with known concentrations of the respective standards. It should be noted that the columns were eluted for ∼20 min in the event (although unlikely) that higher oligosaccharides were formed by transglycosylation, a reaction that is catalyzed under appropriate conditions by some glycosidases. BglA and the cellotetraose were incubated for 12 h at which point only Glc was detected in the incubation mixture. Aliquots were taken periodically starting at 0.5 min. Some of the results are shown in Fig.4 and are discussed below. As indicated in the Introduction, we have identified 10 contiguous genes in the V. cholerae genome that may constitute a chitin disaccharide transport and catabolic operon. In this report, one of these genes, VC0615 designated here as bglA, was molecularly cloned from V. cholerae DNA into a high expression strain ofE. coli. The protein was purified to apparent homogeneity and was characterized as a β-glucosidase. The enzyme hydrolyzed cellobiose and aryl β-glucosides such as p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside. It was also active with higher cellulose oligosaccharides, e.g. the trisaccharides, tetrasaccharides, and pentasaccharides, and in each case Glc was formed. However, BglA did not hydrolyze any other glucoside tested including the positional isomers of cellobiose, nor did it act on (GlcNAc)2. The question raised under “Results” is whether BglA is an exoglucosidase as suggested by the biochemical data or an endoglucosidase as suggested by the sequence or both. In an attempt to answer this question, BglA was incubated with cellotetraose (G4) and the products were analyzed as a function of time of incubation. In the following, it is assumed that the rate constants for hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds far exceed the rate constants in the opposite direction. For purposes of this discussion the reactions can be treated as “irreversible.” If the enzyme is a pure endoglucanase, the reaction would be as follows.Glc4→2Glc2REACTION 1 If the enzyme is a pure exoglucanase, the products would be as follows.Glc4→Glc+Glc3→2Glc+Glc2→4GlcREACTION 2 The enzyme could function processively as follows.Glc4+BglA→BglA:Glc4→BglA:Glc3→BglA:Glc2→BglA:Glc→BglA+4GlcREACTION 3 That is, once the enzyme binds the tetrasaccharide, the hydrolytic cleavages proceed sequentially until the final products (4Glc) are formed. Because BglA also hydrolyzes the trisaccharides and disaccharides, the on and off rates of dissociation of the intermediates BglA:Glc3 and BglA:Glc2 would have to be included in the model. If these rates favor dissociation, the enzyme would be partially processive. Some of the kinetic results are shown in Fig. 4 (A (0–5 min), B (0–20 min), and C (0–60 min)). The curves are fitted to the experimental data points by a computer program KYPlot. It should be noted that the conditions were deliberately chosen so that if cellotriose and especially cellobiose were produced, they would accumulate and could be detected before there was significant hydrolysis. That is, the initial concentration of substrate is 3 mm, but the Km for hydrolysis of cellobiose is ∼7 mm, and the values for cellotriose and cellotetraose appear to be around the same. At the early time points, the products are Glc and Glc3. As the concentration of substrate falls, so do the rates of formation of the two major products Glc and Glc3. The concentration of Glc3 reaches a steady state as it is formed from Glc4 and hydrolyzed to Glc2. According to the equations written above, the key to the question of exoglucanase versus endoglucanase is the rate of appearance of cellobiose. No Glc2 was detected until 5 min, and it gradually accumulated until at 1 h it was 1 mm (well below its Km); the same as cellotriose, which had reached a steady state at ∼10 min. The next question was whether we could explain these kinetics by some reasonable mechanism or pathway. Fig.5 shows that we could adequately model and simulate the kinetics by formulating the following simple sequence of reactions, i.e. for an exoglucanase.G4+E⇄k−1k1E+G3+GG3+E⇄k−2k2E+G2+GG2+E⇄k−3k3E+2GG+E⇄k−4k4EGREACTION 4–7 Thus, the simulation fits the simplest model, a pure exoglucosidase. It should be stressed that over the course of the first 5–10 min, the simulation fits the data points without introducing end product inhibition (Reaction 7). At longer times, the concentrations of the substrates, Glc4, G3, and G2, fall to ∼1 mm, whereas the concentration of Glc rises to 2–3 mm. Under these conditions, it was necessary to introduce Reaction 4 to obtain good fits to the data points. There is one additional point that bears on the mechanism of the reaction. Virtually, all of the exoglycosidases hydrolyze their oligosaccharide substrates at the non-reducing termini, but it is conceivable that hydrolysis can start at the reducing end of the molecule. In this case, either mechanism would yield Glc and Glc3 from Glc4. The results withpNP-Glc2 indicate that hydrolysis starts at the non-reducing terminus, because no pNP is detected until sufficient pNP-Glc and Glc are formed in the mixture so that the pNP is hydrolyzed. Thus, all of our results are consistent with the conclusion that BglA is an exoglucosidase, and that its assignment as an endoglucanase (based on sequence) must be re-evaluated. There is a hint that the enzyme may be partially processive. At the earliest time points, the only detectable products are Glc and cellotriose, and Glc exceeds Glc3 by ∼60%. But these should be equimolar if the enzyme is not processive. If it is partially processive and the excess Glc is corrected for the fact that 1m Glc4 yields 4Glc, the results suggest that the enzyme may be ∼15% processive under these conditions. The specificity of BglA raises an important question. What is the physiological function of this enzyme, and why is it in the cluster of genes we presume to be a (GlcNAc)2 transport/catabolic operon? We can only speculate. To begin with, the same gene is present in the genome of V. furnissii. However, neither V. furnissii nor V. cholerae catabolizes cellobiose or cellulose in contrast to their rapid utilization of chitin oligosaccharides and, more slowly, of chitin. There is at least one possibility that we can suggest. In plants, lignin is a polymerization product of the phenols formed from phenolic β-glucosides such as coniferin and syringin. The glucosides are cleaved by essential plant aryl-β-glucosidases (13Dharmawardhana D.P. Ellis B.E. Carlson J.E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 107: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, the phenols can also serve other functions. The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciensprovokes tumor growth in infected plants, and the major pre-inducer of the bacterial virulence genes is the plant β-glucoside, coniferin. But the glucoside is first processed by the bacterial β-glucosidase to yield the phenol, coniferyl alcohol, the true inducer of the virulence genes (14Castle L.A. Smith K.D. Morris R.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1478-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In other words, the β-glucosidase serves as part of an important signaling sequence. Because V. cholerae spends part of its life cycle associated with marine plants, it is conceivable that BglA has a similar although unknown function, namely to hydrolyze certain aryl-β-glucosides. Studies are in progress to define the functions of BglA by constructing an in-frame deletion of the gene in the V. cholerae genome, which may result in a significant change in the phenotype of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2064325951,"The NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent enzyme that transfers electrons from NADPH to O2 to generate superoxide (O2*-), the precursor of microbicidal oxygen species that play an important role in host defense. Flavocytochrome b558, a heterodimeric oxidoreductase comprised of gp91(phox) and p22(phox) subunits, contains two nonidentical, bis-histidine-ligated heme groups imbedded within the membrane. Four histidine residues that appear to serve as noncovalent axial heme ligands reside within the hydrophobic N terminus of gp91(phox), but the role of p22(phox) in heme binding is unclear. We compared biochemical and functional features of wild type flavocytochrome b558 with those in cells co-expressing gp91(phox) with p22(phox) harboring amino acid substitutions at histidine 94, the only invariant histidine residue within the p22(phox) subunit. Substitution with leucine, tyrosine, or methionine did not affect heterodimer formation or flavocytochrome b558 function. The heme spectrum in purified preparations of flavocytochrome b558 containing the p22(phox) derivative was unaffected. In contrast, substitution of histidine 94 with arginine appeared to disrupt the intrinsic stability of p22(phox) and, secondarily, the stability of mature gp91(phox) and abrogated O2*- production. These findings demonstrate that His94 p22(phox) is not required for heme binding or function of flavocytochrome b558 in the NADPH oxidase."

This is a first indication that endothelial chemokines can attenuate in situ L-selectin adhesion to endothelial ligands at subsecond contacts. This negative feedback mechanism may underlie the jerky nature of rolling mediated by L-selectin in vivo. Selectins mediate the reversible capture (tethering) of circulating leukocytes to vascular endothelium at numerous types of inflamed or lymphoid target tissues (1Kansas G.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 3259-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Leukocyte tethers are short-lived and must be rapidly propagated into rolling adhesions, to allow the recruited leukocyte to survey the endothelial lining for additional stimulatory molecules, predominantly chemokines (2Mackay C.R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Chemokines elicit rapid signals through binding to specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG-protein-coupled receptorFCSfetal calf serumGlyCAM-1glycoprotein cell adhesion molecule 1HEVhigh endothelial venuleHSAhuman serum albuminILinterleukinmAbmonoclonal antibodyJAKJanus kinasePNAdperipheral node addressinPBLperipheral blood lymphocytesPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePSGL-1P-selectin glycoprotein ligandPTXpertussis toxinSDF-1αstromal cell-derived factor-1αSLCsecondary lymphoid tissue chemokineSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionVLA-4very late antigen 41The abbreviations used are: GPCRG-protein-coupled receptorFCSfetal calf serumGlyCAM-1glycoprotein cell adhesion molecule 1HEVhigh endothelial venuleHSAhuman serum albuminILinterleukinmAbmonoclonal antibodyJAKJanus kinasePNAdperipheral node addressinPBLperipheral blood lymphocytesPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePSGL-1P-selectin glycoprotein ligandPTXpertussis toxinSDF-1αstromal cell-derived factor-1αSLCsecondary lymphoid tissue chemokineSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionVLA-4very late antigen 4 on tethered leukocytes, which trigger the avidity of leukocyte integrins to endothelial ligands, and thereby stabilize secondary leukocyte adhesion, arrest, and subsequent extravasation (3Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Whether chemokine signals transduced to a rolling leukocyte can also modulate the adhesive properties of its selectin or selectin ligands has not been demonstrated. Soluble chemoattractants have been shown, on the other hand, to trigger L-selectin shedding by cell surface endoproteolysis, implicating blood-borne chemokines as potential down-regulators of selectin-mediated rolling (4Smith C.W. Kishimoto T.K. Abbassi O. Hughes B. Rothlein R. McIntire L.V. Butcher E. Anderson D.C. Abbass O. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 5Alexander S.R. Kishimoto T.K. Walcheck B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Selectin rolling is a highly dynamic process that depends on subsecond coupling of tethers successively formed and broken at the cell front and trailing edge under disruptive shear forces (6Kaplanski G.

Springer T.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). L-selectin rolling adhesions can be mediated by single tethers preferentially formed at microvillar surface projections where L-selectin is preferentially localized (8Picker L.J. Warnock R.A.

Butcher E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 989-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Notably, L-selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling in vivo is extremely fast and jerky in nature (10Warnock R.A. Askari S. Butcher E.C. von Andrian U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), even at endothelial sites expressing high levels of L-selectin ligands such as the peripheral lymph node high endothelial venules (HEV) (10Warnock R.A. Askari S. Butcher E.C. von Andrian U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 11Stein J.V. Rot A. Luo Y. Narasimhaswamy M. Nakano H. Gunn M.D. Matsuzawa A. Quackenbush E.J. Dorf M.E. von Andrian U.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Stabilization of L-selectin-mediated rolling, characterized by smooth rather than jerky motion, is critically dependent on the number of bonds simultaneously formed at each microvillar contact site (12Chen S. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that the jerky nature of L-selectin-mediated rolling in various in vivo settings might be caused by reduced L-selectin adhesiveness on leukocytes interacting with endothelium-displayed L-selectin ligands. In the present in vitro study, we found that several key chemokines, shown to be displayed on endothelial surfaces in vivo, are capable of strongly destabilizing the rolling activity of L-selectin in different types of leukocytes. Notably, this suppression of rolling was mediated by immobilized rather than soluble chemokines. Leukocyte capture to ligand, although normal, allowed the rapid encounter of immobilized chemokines co-displayed with L-selectin ligands, thereby eliciting the in situ reduction of L-selectin tether avidity to ligand. Surprisingly, destabilization of rolling was not the result of proteolytic L-selectin shedding. Furthermore, chemokine-mediated suppression of selectin rolling, although dependent on metabolic energy, did not involve intracellular signaling through the chemokine receptor. This is a first demonstration that endothelial chemokines may regulate selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling through a nonproteolytic Gi-protein-independent process, prior to and independent of their triggering of integrin adhesiveness.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and ReagentsThe anti-L-selectin mAb, DREG-200 (13Kishimoto T.K.

The mononuclear cells thus obtained were washed and further purified on nylon wool and plastic adherence as described (22Carr M.W. Alon R. Springer T.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The resulting purified PBL consisted of more than 90% CD3+ T lymphocytes and were cultured in lipopolysaccharide-free RPMI, 10% FCS for 15–18 h before use.

Clones were maintained in RPMI 1640, supplemented with antibiotics, 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.1 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. The human umbilical vein endothelial cell-derived line, ECV-304 (LS12), stably transfected with α-1,3-fucosyltransferase and N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase and expressing functional sulfated L-selectin ligands (26Kimura N. Mitsuoka C. Kanarmori A. Hiraiwa N. Uchimura K. Muramatsu T. Tamatani T. Kansas G.S. R. K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4530-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. R. Kannagi (Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics.Immunofluorescence Flow CytometryIndirect immunofluorescence was performed on washed cells that were suspended in PBS supplemented with 5% FCS and 5 mmEDTA. Cells were incubated at 4 °C either with 10 μg/ml L-selectin mAb DREG-200 or with pre-immune mouse IgG. Cells were washed, stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig, resuspended in PBS supplemented with 0.05% sodium azide, and immediately analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer (BD PharMingen, Erembodegem, Belgium). To assess protein kinase C-induced L-selectin shedding, PBL or neutrophils were suspended in cell binding medium (see below) in the presence of protease inhibitors or with control carrier solution for 15 min at 25 °C as described previously (20Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Walcheck B. Kahn J. Fisher J.M. Wang B.B. Fisk R.S. Payan D.G. Feehan C. Betageri R. Darlak K. Spatola A.F. Kishimoto T.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Leukocytes were then treated with PMA (100 ng/ml, 2–10 min, 25 °C) and immediately incubated at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml DREG-200, followed by staining with secondary mAb, as described above.Preparation of Ligand-coated SubstratesAliquots of GlyCAM-1, PNAd, or PSGL-1 were diluted in coating medium (PBS, supplemented with 20 mm bicarbonate, pH 8.5) and adsorbed onto polystyrene plates as described previously (27Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Washed substrates were adsorbed with 0.1–4 μg/ml amount of either intact or heat-inactivated chemokines for 3 h at 4 °C. The anti-L-selectin mAb DREG-200 was mixed with either intact or heat-inactivated chemokines in the presence of 2 μg/ml HSA and coated onto polystyrene plates overnight at 4 °C. Neutralite avidin was diluted in PBS, 40 mm bicarbonate, pH 9.0, and adsorbed onto a polystyrene plate overnight at 4 °C, followed by HSA blocking at 4 °C. An equimolar mixture of biotin-labeled PSGL-1-derived selectin-binding peptide (2 × 10−2 nm) and either biotin-labeled SDF-1α or an inactive biotin-labeled control PSGL-1 peptide was diluted in cell binding medium (see below) and adsorbed for 4 h at 4 °C on the avidin-coated plate. Substrates coated with avidin complexed with inactive biotin-labeled glycopeptides lacked any adhesive activity to all L-selectin-expressing leukocytes tested.Laminar Flow AssaysCell Tethering and Rolling MeasurementsThe polystyrene plate, on which purified ligand was adsorbed, was assembled in a parallel plate laminar flow chamber as described previously (28Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar). Various leukocyte populations were washed in H/H medium (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 5 mm EDTA, resuspended in cell binding medium (H/H medium supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2) at 2 × 106cells/ml, and perfused at room temperature through the flow chamber at a rate generating wall shear stress of 0.1 dyn/cm2, as described (27Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Once reaching the upstream side of the test adhesive substrate, the flow rate was elevated to generate a shear stress of 0.75, 1, or 1.75 dyn/cm2, and all cellular interactions were visualized at two different fields of view (each one 0.17 mm2 in area) using a 10× objective of an inverted phase contrast microscope (Diaphot 300, Nikon Inc., Tokyo, Japan). An imaging system was used for analysis of instantaneous velocities of leukocytes, WSCAN-Array-3 (Galai, Migdal-Ha'emek, Israel) as described previously (27Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Accumulation of rolling leukocytes on the test fields was determined by computerized cell motion tracking. Adhesive interactions of transiently tethered cells were also manually analyzed as described (27Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The frequency of rolling cells was defined as the number of cells out of the cell flux that initiated persistent rolling on the adhesive substrate lasting at least 3 s after initial tethering. Transient tethers were cells that attached only briefly to the substrate (< 0.2 s). Frequency of each category of tethers was expressed in % units; 1% unit measured at 1.75 dyn/cm2 corresponded to tethering rate of 5.25 × 10−3 event × cell−1 mm−1s−1.To block GPCRs on target leukocytes, cells suspended in binding medium were preincubated for 45 min at 37 °C with 0.5 μg/ml soluble chemokines and perfused into the chamber. For blocking Gi-protein signaling, PBL were cultured for 15 h at 37 °C in culture medium alone or in the presence of 100 ng/ml PTX. For blocking JAK/STAT pathway stimulation by chemokines, lymphocytes were preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 150 μmJAK inhibitor, tyrphostin AG490, or with control Me2SO solution (0.1%, v/v). To inhibit metabolic energy without interfering with intact L-selectin rolling activity (29Dwir O. Shimron F. Chen C. Singer M. Rosen S.D. Alon R. Cell. Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 349-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), lymphocytes were pretreated with 0.05% sodium azide for 2 min at room temperature, and perfused unwashed into the chamber. To adsorb SDF-1α on an endothelial monolayer, SDF-1α (100 ng/ml) was overlaid for 5 min on an L-selectin ligand-expressing ECV-304 cell monolayer assembled on the lower plate of the flow chamber. Unbound chemokine was removed by extensive washing. Overlaid chemokine remained bound to the monolayer throughout the assay, as confirmed in repetitive experiments after extensive washings.Dissociation Kinetics of Individual Transient Tethers and Successive Rolling TethersMicrokinetics of individual cells exhibiting jerky rolling on medium density GlyCAM-1 was analyzed on digitized video segments using the WSCAN-Array-3 software as described previously (27Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Individual cell displacement analysis at 0.02-s intervals monitored changes in instantaneous cell velocities in the flow direction, depicted as successive transient pauses (27Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The natural log of the number of all pauses or tethers formed by a given number of perfused leukocytes that remained bound after a given duration was plotted as a function of time, yielding tether dissociation curves with slopes representing −koff.DISCUSSIONSelectin-mediated tethering and rolling are prerequisite for leukocytes to survey the endothelial lining for proadhesive and promigratory signals, primarily apical chemokines (3Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 10Warnock R.A. Askari S. Butcher E.C. von Andrian U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Rolling leukocytes must integrate chemokine signals within subsecond contacts along the direction of flow (17Grabovsky V. Feigelson S. Chen C. Bleijs R. Peled A. Cinamon G. Baleux F. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Lapidot T. van Kooyk Y. Lobb R. Alon R. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 40Campbell J.J. Hedrick J. Zlotnik A. Siani M.A. Thompson D.A. Science. 1998; 279: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 41Constantin G. Majeed M. Giagulli C. Piccio L. Kim J.Y. Butcher E.C. Laudanna C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Here we suggest that apically displayed endothelial chemokines may not merely transmit integrin-activating signals to rolling leukocytes, but in fact directly modulate the rolling process itself, through an in situ reduction of selectin tether stability. Thus, rolling adhesions that allow a captured leukocyte to sample the endothelium for specific chemokines are subjected to a negative feedback mechanism by these very chemokines. Rather than being discrete and sequential events (42Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar), reversible selectin interactions and chemokine receptor occupancy events appear to simultaneously operate at particular adhesive zones bearing immobilized chemokines juxtaposed to L-selectin ligands. As a result, selectin-mediated rolling, which has been predicted to increase encounter of endothelium-displayed chemokines (43Hafezi-Moghadam A. Thomas K.L. Prorock A.J. Huo Y. Ley K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), is in fact attenuated by this encounter. Attenuation of rolling is predicted to be more robust at sites of leukocyte interaction with high densities of L-selectin ligand, probably at endothelial regions within lymph node HEV enriched with L-selectin ligands (11Stein J.V. Rot A. Luo Y. Narasimhaswamy M. Nakano H. Gunn M.D. Matsuzawa A. Quackenbush E.J. Dorf M.E. von Andrian U.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In addition, because the local density of chemokine on endothelial surfaces is heterogeneous (35Middleton J. Neil S. Wintle J. Clark-Lewis I. Moore H. Lam C. Auer M. Rot A. Cell. 1997; 91: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), this attenuation mechanism may result in multiple dynamic outcomes. In regions of low chemokine density, L-selectin-mediated rolling is expected to be accelerated (Fig. 2), whereas L-selectin-mediated rolling on specific regions expressing high density chemokine is expected to be strongly suppressed (Fig. 2). This would cause a rolling leukocyte to detach from such sites, while allowing it to jerk and rebind ligand at an adjacent downstream sites. Furthermore, chemokine distribution on individual endothelial cells is nonuniform, as chemokines can be found in clusters on endothelial microvilli (35Middleton J. Neil S. Wintle J. Clark-Lewis I. Moore H. Lam C. Auer M. Rot A. Cell. 1997; 91: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). These domains could be preferential sites of chemokine destabilization of L-selectin rolling. The jerky nature of L-selectin rolling is not controlled solely by chemokines. Anti-adhesive glycoproteins like CD43 (44Stockton B.M. Cheng G. Manjunath N. Ardman B. von Andrian U.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 373-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), topological heterogeneity of both leukocyte and endothelial surfaces (45Finger E.B. Bruehl R.E. Bainton D.F. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5085-5096PubMed Google Scholar), as well as intrinsic properties of L-selectin bonds (46Alon R. Chen S. Puri K.D. Finger E.B. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1169-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar,47Puri K.D. Finger E.B. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 405-413PubMed Google Scholar) can each contribute to the jerky nature of L-selectin-mediated rolling of leukocytes along various blood vessels. The existence of such multiple mechanisms for attenuating L-selectin rolling suggests that the jerky nature of L-selectin-mediated rolling is of major physiological significance. One possible outcome of such suppression of rolling could be to attenuate direct integrin activation by L-selectin, a process that depends on L-selectin ligation by ligand and bypasses chemokine regulation of leukocyte arrest on integrin ligands (48Hwang S.T. Singer M.S. Giblin P.A. Yednock T.A. Bacon K.B. Simon S.I. Rosen S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1343-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 49Steeber D.A. Engel P. Miller A.S. Sheetz M.P.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 2891-2901PubMed Google Scholar).Spontaneous and chemoattractant-induced proteolytic shedding of L-selectin was traditionally proposed as a major negative feedback mechanism of L-selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling (21Walcheck B. Kahn J. Fisher J.M. Wang B.B. Fisk R.S. Payan D.G. Feehan C. Betageri R. Darlak K. Spatola A.F. Kishimoto T.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 51Kishimoto T.K. Jutila M.A. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1238-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). However, the Gi-protein-independent chemokine destabilization of L-selectin rolling studied here did not involve L-selectin shedding, previously shown to involve activation of GPCR signaling (4Smith C.W. Kishimoto T.K. Abbassi O. Hughes B. Rothlein R. McIntire L.V. Butcher E. Anderson D.C. Abbass O. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 51Kishimoto T.K. Jutila M.A. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1238-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The insensitivity of chemokine suppression of rolling to PTX blockage of Gi signaling, demonstrated here, also rules out the possibility that chemokines suppress L-selectin rolling through Gi-protein-dependent phosphorylation of the L-selectin cytoplasmic tail (52Haribabu B.

Indeed, even lymphocytes expressing tail-truncated L-selectin were sensitive to chemokine suppression of rolling. Similar to our finding of an accelerated L-selectin rolling induced by low level chemokine (Fig. 2), Campbell and co-authors (40Campbell J.J. Hedrick J. Zlotnik A. Siani M.A. Thompson D.A. Science. 1998; 279: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) reported 2-fold faster L-selectin-dependent rolling of murine lymphocytes on PNAd co-immobilized with chemokines. The study attributed the accelerated rolling to chemokine blockage of L-selectin binding carbohydrates on the substrate. Our evidence that chemokines suppress L-selectin binding to mAb, an L-selectin-binding protein that lacks any selectin-binding carbohydrates, rules out the possibility of L-selectin ligand masking by chemokine. Furthermore, our finding that chemokines fail to suppress L-selectin adhesion to low density ligand (Fig. 7B) also rules out a direct blockage of ligand activity by chemokine. Instead, our data strongly suggest that chemokines induce rapid redistribution of both chemokine receptors and L-selectin at adhesive contact sites, possibly through extracellular or membranal associations of their receptors with juxtaposed L-selectin molecules. Recent electron microscopic analysis of the chemokine receptors for SDF-1α and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), CXCR4 and CCR5, respectively, in PBL has demonstrated that these GPCRs localize to lymphocyte microvilli (53Singer I.I.

The signaling pathway(s) that control pectinase gene expression are currently unknown in filamentous fungi.

Whereas the regulatory pathways that control pectinase gene expression are well documented in phytopathogenic bacteria (9Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Condemine G. Nasser W. Reverchon S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 213-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), little is known about the regulation of fungal pectinases. Recently, ccSNF1, a gene encoding a protein homologous to the yeast protein kinase SNF1 required for expression of glucose-repressed genes, was isolated from the maize pathogen Cochliobolus carbonum (10Tonukari N.J. Scott-Craig J.S. Walton J.D. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 237-248PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants disrupted in this gene showed a reduced pathogenicity, and genes coding for hydrolytic enzymes were down-regulated. Colletotrichum lindemuthianum is a pathogenic fungus that is the causal agent of bean anthracnose. Conidia germinate on the surface of the aerial part of the plant and differentiate a specialized cell called appressorium, which allows the parasite to penetrate plant tissues (11Perfect S.E. Hughes H.B. O'Connell R.J. Green J. Fungal. Genet. Biol. 1999; 27: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). During the first stages of infection, C. lindemuthianum establishes a biotrophic interaction with the host plant. 3–4 days post-inoculation, the parasite develops secondary hyphae and becomes necrotrophic, causing tissue necrosis. In a previous work, we characterized two endoPG genes, CLPG1 andCLPG2, from C. lindemuthianum (12Centis S. Dumas B. Fournier J. Marolda M. Esquerré-Tugayé M.-T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 170: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Centis S. Guillas I. Séjalon N. Esquerré-Tugayé M.-T. Dumas B. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1997; 10: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).CLPG1 encodes the major endoPG isoform that is produced during axenic culture of the fungus on pectin and during the necrotrophic stage of infection. CLPG2 is early and only transiently expressed at the onset of plant infection and on pectin. Recently we developed the use of GFP1 as a reporter gene to study the transcriptional regulation of CLPG2 (14Dumas B. Centis S. Sarrazin N. Esquerré-Tugayé M.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter of CLPG2 allowed expression of the reporter gene during the germination of conidia on pectin medium and during appressorium formation both on a glass slide and during pathogenesis, which indicates that diverse signals can induce endoPG gene transcription. The main goal of the present study was to look forcis-acting elements in the promoter of CLPG2involved in the induction of this gene under various situations. Deletions of the promoter delineated a 27-bp fragment required forCLPG2 induction on pectin and during appressorium formation. It is shown that this DNA fragment binds protein factors and contains two essential elements that are highly homologous to the yeast filamentation and invasion response element (FRE). C. lindemuthianum race β was maintained on synthetic agar medium as described (15Bannerot H. Ann. Amélior. Plantes. 1965; 15: 201-222Google Scholar) or grown on 9-cm cellophane disks laid down onto the surface of 20 ml of solid ANM medium (2% malt extract, 0.1% bactopeptone, 2% d(+)-glucose, 2% agar) in Petri dishes. After inoculation with 105 conidia/dish, the mycelium was allowed to develop for 48 h at 24 °C before being transferred for 10 h on solid medium supplemented with apple pectin (16Barthe J.P. Cantenys D. Touzé A. Phytopathology. 1981; 100: 162-171Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or for 24 h on bean cotyledonary leaves in a highly humid atmosphere. Transformation of C. lindemuthianum was done according to Ref. 17Hargreaves J. Turner G. Gurr S.J. MacPherson M.J. Bowles D.J. Molecular Plant Pathology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 79-97Google Scholar except that the protoplasts were purified by the flotation method (18Yelton M.M. Hamer J.E. Timberlake W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1470-1474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were regenerated on a medium containing hygromycin at a final concentration of 50 μg·ml−1. The 5′ end of theCLPG2 mRNA was determined by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Total RNA from pectin-induced C. lindemuthianum mycelium was prepared and submitted to first strand cDNA synthesis using a gene-specific reverse primer pg2+1207 (TableI) and SuperScriptTM II (Invitrogen). The original mRNA template was removed by treatment with RNase H. cDNA was purified with GlassMAX® Spin Cartridge, and a homopolymeric tail was added to the 3′ end using terminal transferase and dCTP. PCR amplification was accomplished usingTaq DNA polymerase, the nested gene-specific reverse primer pg2+178 (Table I), and a C-tailing annealing primer. 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends products were cloned in pGEM®-T vector (Promega) and sequenced.Table ISequence and position of primers used for PCR, 5′ end mapping, and GMSA Open table in a new tab To fuse the CLPG2 promoter to the coding sequence of the GFP,NcoI and BamHI restriction sites were introduced, respectively, in the 5′ and 3′ ends of the promoter fragment by PCR. The construct PG2-490 (see Fig. 1 A) was obtained by PCR amplification using the CLPG2 genomic clone (13Centis S. Guillas I. Séjalon N. Esquerré-Tugayé M.-T. Dumas B. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1997; 10: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as a template and pg2-490 and pg2+178 (Table I) as 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. The PCR product was digested by BamHI andNcoI and cloned in the blue SGFP-TYG-nos SK plasmid (19Sheen J. Hwang S. Niwa Y. Kobayashi H. Galbraith D.W. Plant J. 1995; 8: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) restricted with BamHI and NcoI, resulting in a translational fusion of the CLPG2 promoter with the GFP gene, which included six codons of the CLPG2 coding sequence. Constructs PG2-90, PG2-63, andPG2-90:TLE were obtained through the same strategy using, respectively, pg2-90, pg2-63, and pg2-90:TLE as 5′ end primers (TableI). Deletion PG2-490Δ27 was generated by the GenEditorTM in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) using the 5′-phosphorylated primer pg2-490Δ27 according to the recommendations of the supplier. To constitutively express GFP, the GFP coding sequence was fused to a 405-bp fragment of the GPDA promoter from Aspergillus nidulans, which was obtained by amplification with primers gpd-S and gpd-R (Table I) and pAN7–1 vector (20Punt P. Oliver R.P. Dingemanse M.A. Pouwels P.H. Van Den Hondel C.A.M.J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) as template. The construct containing 3×TLE-90 was prepared by annealing primers 3×TLE-90-S and 3×TLE-90-R. The resulting DNA fragment, which contained the 5′-SstII and 3′-BamHI restriction sites, was cloned in front of the 405-bp GPDA promoter of the constitutive GFP-expressing vector restricted with SstII andBamHI. Wells of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay microplates were filled with 100 μl of liquid medium supplemented with d(+)-glucose or apple pectin as above, inoculated with 103 conidia, and incubated for 24 h at 24 °C in the dark. For appressorium differentiation, 100 μl of droplets containing 103 conidia were laid down onto glass slides and incubated for 48 h at 24 °C in a highly humid atmosphere in plastic boxes. For infection experiments, hypocotyls of 7-day-old bean seedlings were excised and inoculated with 5 μl of a suspension containing 5 × 102 conidia. After 48 h at 24 °C, strips of epidermal tissue were harvested and mounted in distilled water for microscopy. All of the samples were observed under fluorescence microscopy with an inverted microscope Leitz DM IRBE and a computer monitored digital color camera (Photonic Science). The figures were prepared from digitized images, and fluorescence was quantified using ImageProPlus (Media Cybernetic). The mycelium that was grown on glucose or pectin or recovered from inoculated cotyledonary leaves was washed with water and ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen. A crude protein extract was prepared by stirring the powder in extraction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 12% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm ZnCl2) containing a fungal protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After incubation on ice for 1 h, the extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The recovered supernatant was retained at the source of soluble protein (1–2 mg protein/ml). All of the DNA fragments used for GMSA were generated by annealing two complementary primers. The probe used for DNA binding reactions consisted of two annealed complementary primers, gmsa-S and gmsa-R (Table I), labeled by end filling with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase using [α-32P]dCTP. DNA-protein binding reactions were performed by incubating 15 μg of total protein and 10 fmol of the labeled probe at 22 °C for 20 min in 30 μl of 25 mmHepes, pH 7.8, 12% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ZnCl2, acetylated bovine serum albumin (0.25 mg/ml), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). In competition experiments, unlabeled DNA was added to the reaction medium in a 50–1000-fold excess over the labeled probe. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. Previous experiments using transgenic strains containing a CLPG2-GFP construct showed that a promoter fragment of 668 bp was sufficient to induce expression of the reporter gene in the mycelium grown on pectin and during appressorium formation both in vitro on glass slides and in planta at early stages of pathogenesis (14Dumas B. Centis S. Sarrazin N. Esquerré-Tugayé M.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The general organization of the CLPG2 promoter (PG2-490) is depicted on Fig.1 A. Two transcription start sites were identified 178 and 166 bp upstream from the initiation codon by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR, corresponding to positions +1 and +12, respectively. A putative TATA (TATAA) box was located at position −40. To identify cis-acting elements involved in transcriptional control in vitro and in planta,CLPG2-GFP constructs harboring sequential 5′ deletions of the promoter region of CLPG2 were introduced in the genome of C. lindemuthianum (Fig. 1 A). For each construct, at least four independent transformants were isolated. The presence of GFP was verified by PCR, and the number of GFP copies integrated into the fungal genome was evaluated by Southern blotting. Accumulation of GFP in conidia was detected by fluorescence microscopy. Fig. 1 B shows that induction of GFP expression by pectin and appressorium formation was of the same magnitude in transformants containing the full-length promoter (PG2-490) or the promoter deleted to −90 (PG2-90). However, deletion of a further 27 bp (construct PG2-63) abolished induction of the reporter gene during the three growth conditions. Removal of this 27-bp sequence only from the full-length promoter (constructPG2-490Δ27) did not modify the promoter activity, showing that additional regulatory elements were present upstream on the promoter (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that the construct PG2-90 induced accumulation of GFP transcript on pectin medium, a Northern blot experiment was performed on RNA extracted from the mycelium grown on glucose and transferred on glucose or pectin. Hybridization with probes corresponding to CLPG2 DNA or to the GFP coding sequence showed the simultaneous accumulation of CLPG2 and GFP RNAs on pectin medium (data not shown). Taken together these results indicated that the 27-bp DNA fragment contained regulatory elements allowing GFP transcription in the fungus grown on pectin medium and during appressorium formation in vitro and in planta at the very first stages of pathogenesis. The 27-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides −90 to −63 was chosen as a probe for GMSA (Fig.2). Protein extracts were prepared from the mycelium, which was grown on glucose and subsequently transferred either on glucose or pectin or on bean leaves. In the latter case, the fungus was allowed to grow on a cellophane sheet laid down onto the surface of cotyledonary leaves of the susceptible bean cultivar P12S. Microscopy analysis showed that in these conditions, 24–48 h after inoculation, appressoria were fully differentiated and started to develop primary hyphae through the cellophane sheet, thereby mimicking the first stages of pathogenesis. Removal of the cellophane sheet allowed recovery of the mycelium. In preliminary experiments, we compared the formation of protein-DNA complexes obtained with protein prepared from isolated nuclei or from mycelium. In each case, the same major protein-DNA complex was observed on the gel as shown in Fig. 2 (A andB) with proteins extracted from the mycelium. Accordingly, total protein extracts were used for further experiments. The signal was more intense when the probe was incubated with protein extracts prepared from the mycelium grown on pectin or during pathogenesis, but a signal was also observable with proteins extracted from the mycelium grown on glucose. Competition experiments carried out with an excess of the unlabeled DNA probe efficiently eliminated appearance of the signal, whereas nonspecific competitor DNA did not affect the binding (Fig. 2, A and B). The addition of deoxycholic acid, a chaotropic agent that dissociates protein complexes, led to disappearance of the signal (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that protein-protein interactions are required for the formation of the protein-DNA complex. Analysis of the 27-bp sequence revealed the presence of two different putative regulatory elements (Fig. 3 A). The first element showed a strong homology with the eukaryotic TCS motif containing the TEA/ATTS consensus sequence CATTCY, which binds transcriptional factors belonging to the TEA/ATTS family. Therefore, this element was designated TLE because it contains the sequence GATTCY. A second class of element containing the consensus sequence WN(1, 2)AAN(1, 2)A was called the PRE-like element (PLE) according to its homology with the yeast DNA regulatory sequence WGAAACA called the pheromone response element (PRE), which interacts with the STE12 trans-acting factor. Four TLEs and PLEs were detected along the CLPG2 promoter (Fig.3 A). In yeast, a combination of TCS and PRE has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of genes during the filamentation and invasive response through the binding of TEC1 and STE12 transcription factors (21Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 348-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Remarkably, TLEs and PLEs are also arranged in tandem in the promoter of CLPG2. To determine whether the binding of protein factors on the 27-bp fragment was due to the presence of TLEs and PLEs, GMSA was performed with the 27-bp fragment as the probe and double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to three repetitions of either TLE-90 (3×TLE-90), PLE-79 (3×PLE-79), or PLE-71 (3×PLE-71) as cold competitors (Fig. 3 B). A 50 molar excess of 3×PLE-79 and 3×PLE-71 was sufficient to compete very efficiently with the formation of the complex (Fig. 3 B), whereas a 1000-fold excess of 3×TLE-90 was necessary to disrupt the binding (data not shown). Thus, the proteins binding to the 27-bp DNA fragment appeared to have more affinity for a combination of TLE and PLE than for three TLEs. To further identify mutations in PLEs that alter the binding of nuclear proteins, a competition experiment was performed in the presence of different double-stranded mutated PLE-79 oligonucleotides containing one or two base substitutions compared with the wild type sequence (Fig. 3 C). Oligonucleotides M1, M2, and M4, which contained PLE mutated in the first nucleotide, the central adenine doublet, and the terminal adenine residue, respectively, failed to inhibit the formation of the complex. Thus, the nucleotides residues that are totally conserved between the yeast STE12 binding site and the C. lindemuthianum PLEs are essential for the binding of protein factors. In yeast, TEC1 and STE12 bind as heterodimers on FRE. To determine whether a combination of PLE and TLE can also bind protein factors, GMSA was performed with double-strand DNA fragments corresponding to the 27-bp fragment mutagenized in each of the elements (Fig.4 A). It was found that mutagenesis of TLE-90 alone did not significantly modify the binding of proteins, whereas mutation of PLE-79 and to a lesser extent of PLE-71 strongly increased the formation of the protein-DNA complex. Mutation of TLE-90 and PLE-71 eliminated the binding of protein factors (Fig.4 A). The same oligonucleotides were used as competitors with the wild type sequence as probe (Fig. 4 B). Mutations in TLE-90 or PLE-71 strongly reduced the competition, showing that these mutations decreased the affinity for nuclear factors. Altogether, these experiments showed that a combination of TLE-90 and PLE-71 binds nuclear factors with higher efficiency than two PLEs. In a further experiment, it was determined that transformants harboring GFP under the control of a CLPG2 promoter mutated in the TLE-90 and PLE-71 expressed only a basal level of fluorescence (Fig.4 C). Thus, the ability of DNA fragments to form a complex with proteins in vitro is correlated with the promoter activity in vivo. In yeast, KSS1 is a negative regulator of invasive growth and binds in its unphosphorylated form to STE12, thereby repressing the transcription of target genes containing FRE (22Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Voora D. Baggott D.M. Martinez A.R. Thorner J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2887-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Because mutation of one PLE increased the formation of the protein-DNA complex observed in inducing conditions, we tested the hypothesis that PLEs could be involved in the repression of CLPG2 in the fungus grown on glucose. A synthetic promoter was constructed by fusing three copies of PLE-71 to a constitutive promoter from the A. nidulans GPDA gene (23Punt P.J. Kuyvenhoven A. van den Hondel C.A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This DNA fragment was fused to GFP, and C. lindemuthianumstrains harboring this construct were analyzed by quantitative fluorescence microscopy. The level of fluorescence exhibited by the strains expressing the GFP gene under the control of theGPDA promoter was of the same magnitude when grown on glucose or pectin. However, the addition of 3×PLE-71 strongly reduced the expression on glucose, whereas accumulation of GFP was unchanged on pectin medium (Fig. 5). Thus, a combination of PLEs is sufficient to confer glucose repression on a constitutive promoter. Despite the long lasting interest of plant pathology and biotechnology in fungal pectinases, the molecular mechanisms governing their expression are still unknown. In the present study, we report on the identification of regulatory elements involved in the transcriptional control of CLPG2, a pectinase gene ofC. lindemuthianum. These elements bind protein factors and are essential for expression of a reporter gene during saprophytic growth of the fungus on pectin and during interaction with the host plant. A search for homology with previously described nuclear factor-binding sites revealed the presence of putative TCS. TCS have been reported to bind transcription factors of the TEA/ATTS family mainly involved in developmental processes in fungi and higher eukaryotes (24Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1314-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). A second sequence was identified by homology with the yeast PRE found in promoters of genes involved in the mating response (25Hagen D.C. McCaffrey G. Sprague Jr., G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2952-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A combination of the CLPG2 elements, called TLE and PLE, was sufficient to bind protein factors and ensure promoter activity. These effects were totally lost upon mutagenesis of these elements. Moreover, a construct comprising three PLEs fused to a constitutive promoter was able to repress the constitutive expression of a reporter gene in the fungus grown on glucose medium. Taken together, these results show that the regulation of CLPG2 requires the binding of transcription factors to a DNA sequence comprising TLE and PLE. Up to now, such combinations of elements were not reported in true filamentous fungi. In yeast, a combination of TCS and PRE, also called the FRE, mediates the binding of an heterodimer formed by the association of the transcriptional activators TEC1 and STE12 (21Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 348-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 26Gancedo J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 107-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MAPK KSS1 plays a key role in the transcriptional control of genes regulated by FRE both by derepression and activation. Indeed, the unphosphorylated form of KSS1 is part of a protein complex that also contains STE12, TEC1, and the inhibitory proteins DIG1 or DIG2. Upon phosphorylation through a MAPK cascade, KSS1 dissociates from the complex, thereby destabilizing the STE12-DIG association leading to derepression of the target genes. Simultaneously, phosphorylation of STE12 by KSS1 activates the STE12-driven transcription. The transcriptional repression activity mediated by C. lindemuthianum PLEs strongly suggests that similar mechanisms operate in this fungus. The hypothesis that CLPG2 is regulated by transcription factors related to the yeast STE12 and TEC1 proteins is strengthened by the recent finding that expression of a polygalacturonase gene,PGU1, is induced in yeast during the haploid-invasive growth and diploid pseudohyphal development (27Madhani H.D. Galitski T. Lander E.S. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12530-12535Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This induction requires a functional filamentation MAPK pathway, including the presence of TEC1 and STE12. Thus, during the yeast invasive response, the same molecular mechanisms activate genes involved in cell elongation and differentiation and genes that encode extracellular proteins, allowing the successful colonization of their natural substrates. Related results have been obtained for two animal pathogens, Candida albicans and Cryptoccocus neoformans. In C. albicans, the TEA/ATTS transcription factor CaTEC1 controls hyphal development and expression of genes encoding extracellular proteinases (28Schweizer A. Rupp S. Taylor B.N. Rollinghoff M. Schroppel K. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Similarly, a STE12 homologue from C. neoformansregulates expression of virulence genes, notably encoding an extracellular phospholipase (29Chang Y.C. Penoyer L.A. Kwon-Chung K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3258-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, a STE12-like gene that plays an essential role in sexual reproduction,STEA, was isolated from a true filamentous fungi, A. nidulans (30Vallim M.A. Miller K.Y. Miller B.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the role of this factor in the expression of pectinase genes was not investigated. The likely involvement of transcriptional activators homologous to STE12 in the regulation of the C. lindemuthianum pectinase gene CLPG2 could be related to the presence of MAPKs belonging to the FUS3/KSS1 family. Interestingly, MAPKs homologous to the yeast FUS3/KSS1 have been identified in a number of phytopathogenic fungi (31Tucker S. Talbot N. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2001; 39: 385-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) where they play essential roles in pathogenicity. Thus, disruption of the MAPK FMK1 in the tomato root pathogenFusarium oxysporum greatly reduced the expression of the endopectate lyase gene pl1 (32Di Pietro A. Garcia-MacEira F.I. Meglecz E. Roncero M.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1140-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the results presented in this paper, homologues of the yeast STE12 and TEC1 factors are likely to play a key role in pectinase gene expression, suggesting that mechanisms regulating invasive growth share striking similarities between saprophytic and pathogenic microorganisms. Such similarities were already pointed out for dimorphic fungi able to switch between a yeast and a multicellular invasive filamentous form (21Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 348-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). From our data and the above report, it emerges that the regulation ofCLPG2 might comply with the model proposed in Fig.6. Thus, in repressive medium (glucose medium), the MAPK pathway would not be activated, and binding of protein factors related to the yeast STE12 would repress expression of the gene. In inductive medium (pectin medium) or at early stages of pathogenesis (appressorium development), activation of the MAPK pathway would induce a rearrangement of the protein-DNA complex comprising a STE12-like factor and a protein belonging to TEA/ATTS family of transcription factors. Isolation and functional analysis of these transcription factors are currently underway. 2C. Herbert and B. Dumas, unpublished observations.

We undertook a genetic approach in yeast to establish the influence of base excision repair (BER) defects on the processing of Me-lex lesions on plasmid DNA that harbors the p53 cDNA as target. We constructed a panel of isogenic strains containing a reporter gene to test p53 function and the following gene deletions: Δmag1, Δapn1apn2, and Δapn1apn2mag1. When compared with the wild-type strain, a decrease in survival was observed in Δmag1, Δapn1apn2, and Δapn1apn2mag1. The Me-lex-induced mutation frequency increased in the following order: wild type < Δmag1< Δapn1apn2 = Δapn1apn2mag1. A total of 77 mutants (23 in wild type, 31 in Δmag1, and 23 in Δapn1apn2) were sequenced. Eighty-one independent mutations (24 in wild type, 34 in Δmag1, and 23 in Δapn1apn2) were detected. The majority of base pair substitutions were AT-targeted in all strains (14/23, 61% in wild type; 20/34, 59%, in Δmag1; and 14/23, 61%, in Δapn1apn2). The Mag1 deletion was associated with a significant decrease of GC > AT transitions when compared with both the wild-type and the AP endonuclease mutants. This is the first time that the impact of Mag1 and/or AP endonuclease defects on the mutational spectra caused by 3-MeA has been determined. The results suggest that 3-MeA is critical for Me-lex cytotoxicity and that its mutagenicity is slightly elevated in the absence of Mag1 glycosylase activity but significantly higher in the absence of AP endonuclease activity.

Weis C.C. Swenson D.H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Thus, quantitative and qualitative analyses of the biological role(s) of individual DNA lesions and their relative contribution to the mutagenicity and/or toxicity are difficult tasks. Many clinically used anticancer drugs are DNA alkylating agents. Hence, an understanding of which biological effect is caused by a specific DNA lesion may lead to a more rational design of antineoplastic agents. To exercise a significant regulation over the alkylation pattern on DNA, several alkylating agents were recently synthesized, including Me-lex,1 a methyl sulfonate ester appended to a neutral N-methylpyrrolecarboxamide-based dipeptide (lex) (2Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Mehta P. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7954-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The lex dipeptide binds at A/T-rich sequences in the minor groove of DNA (3Church K.M. Wurdeman R.L. Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6827-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and as a result, Me-lex efficiently methylates the N3 position of adenine (3-A), generating almost exclusively N3-methyladenine (3-MeA) (2Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Mehta P. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7954-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Encell L. Shuker D.E.G. Foiles P.G. Gold B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the alkylation patterns induced by simple methylating agents such as methyl methanesulfonate ester (MMS), which predominantly yields the major groove N7-methylguanine adduct (1Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson D.H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The significant increase in 3-MeA formation closely parallels the higher cytotoxicity of Me-lexversus MMS (4Encell L. Shuker D.E.G. Foiles P.G. Gold B. Chem. Res.

The role of 3-MeA in toxicity is consistent with the observation that Me-lex cytotoxicity is magnified in alkyladenine-DNA glycosylase (Aag) null embryonic stem cells (5Engelward B.P. Dreslin A. Christensen J. Huszar D. Kurahara C. Samson L.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Engelward B.P. Allan J.M. Dreslin A.J. Kelly J.D. Gold B. Samson L.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1980; 140: 101-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). If 3-MeA is mainly a lethal lesion, the 3-MeA specific inducer Me-lex might be expected to combine high cytotoxicity with low mutagenicity, diminishing the undesired carcinogenic property of the different DNA alkylating agents used in cancer therapy (9Henry-Amar M. Dietrich P.Y. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 1993; 7: 369-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Marselos M. Vainio H. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 1751-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In a previous work, we compared the sequence specificity of lesion formation in vitro with the mutation spectrum induced by Me-lex at the human p53 cDNA using a yeast-based functional assay (11Kelly J.D. Inga A. Chen F-X. Dande P. Shah D. Monti P. Aprile A. Burns P.A. Scott G. Abbondandolo A. Gold B. Fronza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18327-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We observed a general lack of correspondence between adduct formation and mutation hot spots that is consistent with the idea that 3-MeA is a cytotoxic rather than a mutagenic lesion. 3-MeA, or the abasic site generated by its spontaneous breakdown (t 12 of ∼24 h at 37 °C), is repaired via the BER pathway(s). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 3-MeA repair is initiated by a 3-methyladenine-DNA-glycosylase (Mag1) followed by the action of AP endonuclease (Apn1, Apn2), DNA polymerase (δ, ε), and DNA ligase (III). APN1 encodes the major AP endonuclease and shares extensive homology with endonuclease IV in Escherichia coli (12Popoff S.C. Spira A.I. Johnson A.W. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4193-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A second AP endonuclease, the product of the APN2 gene, the S. cerevisiaehomologue of the major human AP endonuclease HAP1, accounts for less than 10% of the total AP endonuclease activity in budding yeast (13Johnson R.E. Torres Ramos C.A. Izumi T. Mitra S. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To establish the influence of different BER repair defects on the mutagenic and lethal properties of the specific lesions produced by Me-lex, we constructed, starting from the parental yeast strain yIG397, the following panel of isogenic strains: yPM2 (Δmag1), yPC2 (Δapn1apn2), and yPC3 (Δapn1apn2mag1). All strains contain the ADE2 gene regulated by a p53-responsive promoter to assess p53 transactivation function. On plates containing limiting adenine, clones expressing wild-type p53 give rise to normal size white colonies, whereas those expressing a non-functional mutant originate small red colonies (14Flaman J.M. Frebourg T. Moreau V. Charbonnier F. Martin C. Chappuis P. Sappino A.-P. Limacher J.-M. Bron L. Benhattar J. Tada M. van Meir E.G. Estreicher A. Iggo R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). A yeast expression vector harboring the human wild-type p53 cDNA was treated in vitro with Me-lex and transformed into each strain. Survival levels andp53 mutant frequencies obtained with wild-type and the BER-defective strains transformed with the exact same Me-lex-damaged DNA were compared. Furthermore, three groups of p53 mutants induced by Me-lex and isolated in yIG397, yPM2 (Δmag1), and yPC2 (Δapn1apn2) were sequenced and compared in order to verify the influence of both enzymatic activities on the type and distribution of Me-lex-induced mutations along the p53 cDNA. Reagents of the highest purity were purchased from Sigma or Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Me-lex was prepared as described previously (2Zhang Y. Chen F.-X. Mehta P. Gold B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7954-7965Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The yeast expression vector pTS76 harbors a human wild-type p53 cDNA under the control of an ADH1 constitutive promoter and contains theTRP1 selectable marker. The haploid S. cerevisiaestrain yIG397 (MATa ade2-1 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 his3-11,15 can1-100 ura3-1 URA3 3xRGC::pCYC1::ADE2) and its isogenic BER-deficient derivatives were used as recipients of pTS76. yIG397 was also used for gap repair with plasmid pRDI-22 as described previously (15Inga A. Iannone R. Monti P. Molina F. Bolognesi M. Abbondandolo A. Iggo R. Fronza G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The p53-dependent reporter ADE2 gene allowed the phenotypic selection of p53 mutants as its recombinantcyc1 promoter contains three copies of the responsive element RGC (14Flaman J.M. Frebourg T. Moreau V. Charbonnier F. Martin C. Chappuis P. Sappino A.-P. Limacher J.-M. Bron L. Benhattar J. Tada M. van Meir E.G. Estreicher A. Iggo R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Standard yeast manipulations were performed as described (16). Me-lex was dissolved in Me2SO immediately before the treatment. 3.0 μg of plasmid pTS76 DNA was treated with different Me-lex concentrations (up to 24 mm) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 50% EtOH for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA was purified by EtOH precipitation, washed with 70% EtOH, and resuspended in sterile water. Damaged or undamaged vectors were then transformed by the LiAc method into the same number of yeast cells (as measured at A 600), in the same growth conditions, and transformants were plated on selective synthetic medium plates specific for each strain (see below). After 3 days of incubation at 30 °C, colonies were evaluated. The selection for the plasmid marker (TRP1) allowed an indirect determination of the lethal effect of the damaging treatment as the number of transformants scored in transfections with damaged plasmids with respect to that obtained with undamaged vector. As transformation plates contained a minimal amount of adenine, adenine auxotrophs produced small red colonies. The spontaneous and induced mutant frequencies (MF) were defined as the number of small red colonies with respect to the total number of transformants. The fold of mutant induction was defined as the ratio between the MF observed with damaged vector with respect to the spontaneous MF. Phenotypic mutant clones were purified and characterized at the molecular level as described previously (15Inga A. Iannone R. Monti P. Molina F. Bolognesi M. Abbondandolo A. Iggo R. Fronza G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The plasmid pTS76 DNA (3 μg) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA was either directly used for determination of abasic sites or treated with 24 mm Me-lex for 1 h at 37 °C. The DNA was purified by EtOH precipitation, washed with 70% EtOH, and resuspended in sterile water, and abasic sites were quantitated using a DNA Damage Quantification Kit (Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle, WA). To inactivate the MAG1 gene, a mag1 disruption cassette (pUC-mag1-del::LEU2a, a 7159-bp plasmid, generous gift of Leona Samson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) was used. To inactivate the APN1 gene, a disruption cassette (YEpApn1, a 6.5-kbp plasmid generous gift of Dr. R.O. Bennett, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA) was used. To inactivate theAPN2 gene, a 2-μm DNA-based marker recycling system for multiple gene disruption was used (pGFKG plasmid, a 11.25-kbp plasmid containing two recombinogenic FRT sequences flanking theFLP recombinase gene and the selectable markerKANR , a generous gift of Dr. Francesca Storici, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC) (17Storici F. Coglievina M. Bruschi C. Yeast. 1999; 15: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The yPC2 (Δapn1apn2) and the yPC3 (Δapn1apn2mag1) strains were obtained by disrupting the APN2 gene as described above in the yPM1 (Δapn1) and yPM3 (Δapn1mag1) strains, respectively. Each gene disruption was checked by PCR using positive and negative controls (details for primers and PCR conditions used are available upon request). The Adams and Skopek (18Adams W.T. Skopek T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) algorithm uses a Monte Carlo method to simulate a p value of the standard hypergeometric test for a contingency table. Unlike the χ2 test, which can also be applied to contingency tables and requires that all cells contain five or more events, the hypergeometric test is appropriate when applied to sparse data sets, as are often found in mutational spectra analyses. The Cariello program (19Cariello N.F. Piegorsch W.W. Adams W.T. Skopek T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2281-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) uses a random number generator to produce a large number of simulated spectra based on the hypergeometric probability of the experimentally observed input spectra. The degree to which the simulated spectra differ from the input spectra is used to estimate the probability that the two input spectra were derived from the same population. A p value equal to 0.05 leads to rejecting the null hypothesis and concluding that the input spectra are different. To determine the relative role of Mag1 and AP endonucleases (Apn1 and Apn2) on the toxicity and mutagenicity induced by Me-lex, we constructed the set of isogenic BER-deficient mutant yeast strains described in ”Materials and Methods“ and summarized in TableI. MAG1, APN1, and APN2 were inactivated using disruption cassettes or a PCR-based method (17Storici F. Coglievina M. Bruschi C. Yeast. 1999; 15: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The correctness of the gene disruption was verified by a PCR approach. The ability of different mutant strains to grow in the presence of MMS was evaluated using plates containing a gradient of MMS (from 0% up to 0.03%) (data not shown). This type of qualitative/semiquantitative analysis confirmed that disruption of MAG1 (yPM2) was associated with the highest sensitivity to MMS, and the further disruption ofAPN1 and APN2 genes (yPC3) was not accompanied by an appreciable increase in MMS sensitivity. These observations are consistent with previous reports (13Johnson R.E. Torres Ramos C.A. Izumi T. Mitra S. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 20Xiao W. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2117-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We conclude that the new isogenic strains deficient in different and/or multiple steps of the BER pathway had the correct gene disruption and the expected phenotype.Table IS. cerevisiae strains constructed for this studyStrainGenotypeReferenceyIG397MATa ade2–1 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 his3–11,15 can1–100 ura3–1 URA3 3xRGC∷pCYC1∷ADE2(14Flaman J.M.

Survival showed an Me-lex concentration-dependent decrease in every strain and was influenced by the BER capacity of the recipient yeast strain. All three BER-deficient strains appear to be ∼10-fold more sensitive to the lethal effects of Me-lex with respect to wild-type. Confirming the results obtained with MMS gradient plates, the single yPM1 mutant (Δapn1) (Fig. 1, upper panel) or yPC1 (Δapn2) (data not shown) showed minimal or no difference in sensitivity to Me-lex, respectively, when compared with yIG397. To determine spontaneous MF, undamaged pTS76 plasmid was transformed into BER-proficient and -deficient strains. Transformants were selected on plates lacking tryptophan but containing sufficient adenine for adenine auxotrophs to grow and turn red. Although yPM2 (Δmag1) showed an MF indistinguishable from the wild-type (yIG397) (5.77 × 10−4 versus 4.35 × 10−4), yPC2 (Δapn1apn2) revealed a significantly higher MF (13.8 × 10−4 versus 4.35 × 10−4,p < 0.02, Chi square test). However, the spontaneous MF reverted back to wild-type level in yPC3 (Δmag1apn1apn2) (2.6 × 10−4) where the MAG1 gene was also disrupted. These results are consistent with, and complement, those obtained by Xiao and Samson (20Xiao W. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2117-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) that support the notion that abasic sites are potent mutagenic lesions. They also suggest that wild-type Mag1 activity partially contributes to the higher MF observed in the yPC2 (Δapn1apn2) strain through the generation of abasic sites by acting on normal undamaged bases. MFs increased not only in a concentration-dependent way in each strain (Fig. 1, lower panel) but were also strongly influenced by the nature of the BER defects. At every Me-lex concentration, MFs increased in the following order: yIG397 < yPM2 < yPC2 = yPC3. Considering the fold of induction above the spontaneous MF in each strain and at every Me-lex concentration, yPM2 (Δmag1) appears to be roughly 2–3-fold more prone to the induction of Me-lex-induced p53 mutants than the wild-type strain, whereas yPC2 (Δapn1apn2) and yPC3 (Δmag1apn1apn2) are at least 10-fold more prone to the induction of p53 mutants. To verify at the molecular level the influence of Mag1 or AP endonuclease activities on the type and distribution of Me-lex-induced mutations along the p53 cDNA, three groups of mutants isolated in yIG397, yPM2 (Δmag1), and yPC2 (Δapn1apn2) strains were characterized. For this purpose, mutants isolated at similar levels of induction (24 mm in yIG397, 12 mm in yPM2, and 6 mm in yPC2) were characterized as described previously (11Kelly J.D. Inga A. Chen F-X. Dande P. Shah D. Monti P. Aprile A. Burns P.A. Scott G. Abbondandolo A. Gold B. Fronza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18327-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At all levels of induction, at least 97% of the mutants were drug-induced. A total of 77 p53 mutants (23 isolated in yIG397, 31 isolated in yPM2, and 23 isolated in yPC2) were sequenced. At least one molecular alteration was found in each mutant. Seventy-seven mutants evidenced 81 independent mutations (24 in yIG397, 34 in yPM2, and 23 in yPC2). With the exception of one 2-bp deletion (in yIG397), all mutations were base pair substitutions. The molecular features of the base pair substitutions are summarized in Table II. The majority of base pair substitutions were AT-targeted in all three strains (14/23, 61%, in yIG397; 20/34, 59%, in yPM2; 14/23, 61% in yPC2). Among AT-targeted mutations, Mag1 deficiency (yPM2) as well as Apn1Apn2 deficiency (yPC2) were associated with a decrease in AT > CG transversions and an increase in AT > GC transitions (both not quite statistically significant) versus yIG397. Among GC-targeted mutations, GC > AT transitions were significantly more frequent in yIG397 and yPC2 (Δapn1apn2) than in yPM2 (Δmag1)(4/9 versus 0/14, p < 0.03, Fisher's exact test in both cases), whereas GC > CG transversions were instead more abundant (∼2-fold but not quite statistically significant) in yPM2 versus yIG397 and yPC2. GC > AT transitions were significantly more frequent in yIG397 (and yPC2) than in yPM2 (Δmag1), even considering all base pair substitutions (4/23 versus 0/34, p < 0.03, Fisher's exact test). At position 602 (codon 201, 5′-602AAATTT597-3′) an Me-lex-induced mutation hot spot (n = 2,p < 0.001, Poisson's normal distribution), common to all three strains (two, three, and four mutations in yPC2 (Δapn1apn2), yPM2 (Δmag1), and yIG397, respectively) was observed. This sequence corresponds to a known lex binding site that was reported previously as the only site in the p53 cDNA hot for both Me-lex lesion formation and Me-lex-induced mutation (11Kelly J.D.

Open table in a new tab The results presented in this work demonstrate that lethality of Me-lex-induced lesions is counteracted mainly by Mag1 (Fig. 1,upper panel), indicating that 3-MeA is cytotoxic. Minimal survival was also observed in the yPC2 (Δapn1apn2) strain because once 3-MeA is removed by Mag1 in an apn1apn2 background, the newly formed abasic site is also lethal. It is interesting to note that the apn1 mutant showed a similar survival response to Me-lex as wild type. This indicates that Apn2 can compensate for the Apn1 deficiency (Apn1 constitutes ∼90% of cellular AP endonuclease activity) and that AP endonuclease activity is not a rate-limiting step in the repair of 3-MeA. For the same reason, the triple mutant yPC3 (Δmag1apn1apn2) is approximately as sensitive as yPM2 (Δmag1) and yPC2 (Δapn1apn2). These results are consistent with the three genes belonging to the same BER pathway and suggest that 3-MeA and the abasic site are equally toxic. There is ample evidence that 3-MeA is a lethal lesion in E. coli (7Shah D. Kelly J. Zhang Y. Dande P. Martinez J. Ortiz G. Fronza G. Tran H. Soto A.M. Marky L. Gold B.

Rasmussen L.J. Najarian M.T. Posnick L.M. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9997-10002Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A remaining question we tried to address is whether 3-MeA, which so effectively prevents DNA synthesis, can also be a promutagenic lesion. Our data shows that Mag1 marginally protects cells against Me-lex mutagenicity. The difference in mutability between wild-type and the mag1 mutant (yPM2) is rather small (2–3-fold), although not negligible. A relatively weak contribution of 3-MeA to Me-lex mutagenicity emerges also from the comparison of the classes of mutations induced in yIG397 and in yPM2 (Δmag1). This comparison reveals that Mag1 deficiency is significantly associated only with a decrease of GC > AT transitions (p < 0.03 Fisher's exact test) (TableII). A decrease in a specific mutation class at GC base pairs in the absence of a DNA repair function is surprising, especially with Me-lex that targets A/T sequences. Moreover, the GC mutation sites are for the most part not adjacent to Me-lex methylation sites. It is known that Mag1, when overexpressed, introduces a strong mutator phenotype in yeast (23Larson K. Sahm J. Shenkar R. Strauss B. Mutat. Res. 1985; 150: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), whereas when underexpressed, it decreases spontaneous mutations (20Xiao W. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2117-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Berdal et al. (24Berdal K.G. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) demonstrated that purified Mag1 protein is able to remove undamaged bases from DNA with G being the best substrate for this undesired activity. Both results (23Larson K. Sahm J. Shenkar R. Strauss B. Mutat. Res. 1985; 150: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 24Berdal K.G. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) predict that Mag1 deficiency will tend not only to exacerbate the mutagenicity of all lesions normally repaired by Mag1 but will also alleviate yeast cells from the “mutagenic stress” derived from “physiological” Mag1 activity. However, the quantitative and qualitative nature of the changes in the Me-lex-induced mutations in the yPM2 mutant strain relative to wild type remain unresolved. The third evidence supporting a weak contribution of 3-MeA to Me-lex mutagenicity is obtained through the comparison of mutational spectra induced by Me-lex in the presence (yIG397) or in the absence (yPM2) of Mag1 activity using the Cariello test, which considers both mutation type and position (19Cariello N.F. Piegorsch W.W. Adams W.T. Skopek T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2281-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The application of this rigorous statistical test, which provides a precise measure of the relatedness of two spectra obtained at the same locus, reveals that the yIG397 and yPM2 spectra are indistinguishable (p = 0.10). This is partially due to the fact that the Me-lex-specific mutation hot spot at position 602 is common to both strains, and it does not appear to be “hotter” in the mag1 background. If 3-MeA was directly responsible for the generation of this hot spot, it is reasonable to expect that this hot spot could be hotter in yPM2 than in yIG397. Clearly, this was not the case. This finding strongly suggests that lesions localized at position 602 are not repaired by Mag1 either because this sequence context is a cold spot for BER repair or because the lesion responsible for such mutations is not a substrate of Mag1. Since we showed previously that 3-MeA was formed in abundant amounts at position 602 (11Kelly J.D. Inga A. Chen F-X. Dande P. Shah D. Monti P. Aprile A. Burns P.A. Scott G. Abbondandolo A. Gold B. Fronza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18327-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we favor the former hypothesis. The existence of cold spots for repair is supported by the work of Ye et al. (25Ye N. Holmquist G.P. O'Connor T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which showed that the sequence-dependent rate of 3-MeA repair at the nucleotide level along the PGK1 gene in normal human fibroblast varied by 6-fold from site to site. An alternative explanation involves an accelerated rate of 3-MeA depurination at that particular position. Based on all the evidence, we conclude that 3-MeA is poorly mutagenic. Analysis of the mutation spectra in more detail shows that there are three additional hot spots (n = 2, p < 0.001, Poisson's normal distribution) in yPM2 (Δmag1) where AT targeted mutations are observed (Fig. 2). At positions 402 and 403, which are both heavily methylated by Me-lex (11Kelly J.D. Inga A. Chen F-X. Dande P. Shah D. Monti P. Aprile A. Burns P.A. Scott G. Abbondandolo A. Gold B. Fronza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18327-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), there are two AT > TA transversions, and two AT > GC transitions, respectively. Clearly, the same lesion induces very different mutations at neighboring bases, and this raises the possibility that phenotypic selection, rather than rates of insertion opposite or near 3-MeA, dominates the observed mutation pattern. For example, the absence of AT > GC transitions at position 402 can be explained since no amino acid substitution would be introduced by this mutation (TTT(F) → TTC(F)). However, the undetected AT > CG transversion would cause the same amino acid substitution as the observed AT > TA transversion (TTT(F) → TTG(L)). In addition to the mutations at positions 402 and 403, there is another strong mutation site at position 773 (where no 3-MeA is observed (11Kelly J.D. Inga A. Chen F-X. Dande P. Shah D. Monti P. Aprile A. Burns P.A. Scott G. Abbondandolo A. Gold B. Fronza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18327-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)) that shows two AT > GC transitions. Interestingly, in yIG397, no mutation was observed at those positions in the present study, whereas a single AT > GC was observed in the previous study (11Kelly J.D. Inga A. Chen F-X. Dande P. Shah D. Monti P. Aprile A. Burns P.A. Scott G. Abbondandolo A. Gold B. Fronza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18327-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All together, these results suggest that the mutation spectra in the presence and absence of Mag1 activity might be distinguished by increasing the number of characterized mutations. Because the two spectra of base pair substitutions obtained in yIG397 (11Kelly J.D. Inga A. Chen F-X. Dande P. Shah D. Monti P. Aprile A. Burns P.A. Scott G. Abbondandolo A. Gold B. Fronza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18327-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) appear to be indistinguishable (p = 0.12, Cariello test), they can be pooled. The mutation spectrum obtained in yPM2 is distinguishable (Fig. 3, upper panel;p < 0.015, Cariello test) from the cumulative one in yIG397, whereas it is indistinguishable from the one obtained in yPC2 (Fig. 3, lower panel; p = 0.84, Cariello test). In contrast to what is observed in yPM2, Me-lex mutagenicity is strongly exacerbated in the absence of both Apn1 and Apn2, independent of the presence (yPC2) or absence (yPC3) of Mag1 and especially at higher Me-lex concentrations. This result suggests that abasic sites or lesions repaired by the activities associated with Apn1 (i.e. 3′-phosphodiesterase (26Ramotar D. Popoff S.C. Gralla E.B. Demple B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar)) and Apn2 (i.e. 3′-phosphodiesterase and 3′-5′-exonuclease (27Unk I. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1656-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)) are mainly responsible for Me-lex mutagenicity. As mentioned before (Fig. 3, lower panel), the mutation spectra obtained in yPM2 and in yPC2 are indistinguishable (p = 0.84, Cariello test), especially with respect to the AT > GC mutations. We propose that the formation of the same secondary lesion is at least partially responsible for this similarity. It is possible that a fraction of 3-MeA is converted into the abasic site due to experimental conditions. We measured the level of abasic sites in the plasmid before and after Me-lex treatment using conditions that mimic those used in the transformation of the plasmid into yeast (chemical exposure, plasmid purification, and transformation conditions) and observed that the level of abasic sites increased by ∼5-fold at 24 mm Me-lex (1.5-fold at 12 mmMe-lex). It is also possible that 3-MeA conversion into abasic site occurs in vivo. 3-MeA is relatively stable in double-stranded DNA at physiological conditions (t 12 = 24 h (28Margison G.P. O'Connor P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 331: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)). However, at the deoxynucleotide level, as would be the case in single-stranded DNA, the stability is dramatically reduced by 40-fold (t 12 of ∼35 min (29Fujii T. Saito T. Nakasaka T. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1989; 8: S17-S19Google Scholar)). Because of this intrinsic instability, we suggest that at a stalled replication fork, a fraction of 3-MeA lesions will undergo hydrolytic conversion to abasic sites. If such abasic sites, when present in replication intermediates, are not good substrates for AP endonucleases (k Apn(ss) ≪k Apn(ds)), and translesion synthesis is preferred at specific A-tract sequences (k Pol≫ k Apn(ss)), then the mutation spectra in mag1 and apn1apn2 cells will be similar (Fig.4). Alternatively, although unlikely, the similarity in the yPM2 and yPC2 spectra might result from the fact that 3-MeA can be bypassed with low efficiency by a specialized polymerase and that bypass of 3-MeA and abasic site will lead to the same mutations. Since Mag1 and Apn1Apn2 proteins are involved in the same BER pathway and since the two spectra appear to be indistinguishable, it is possible to pool the spectra obtained in yPC2 and yPM2 into a cumulative BER-deficient spectrum and compare it with the cumulative spectrum in yIG397 (“BER-proficient”). Interestingly, the “BER-deficient” and the “BER-proficient” mutation spectra are clearly different (Fig. 5,p < 0.006, Cariello test). This analysis shows that a BER defect, irrespective of the specific step, will significantly modify the mutation spectrum. In conclusion, by combining a chemical and a genetic approach, we characterized the molecular consequences of 3-MeA in wild-type and two strains deficient for different steps in BER repair. The picture that is emerging is consistent with 3-MeA being the critical intermediate for Me-lex cytotoxicity. The mutagenicity of 3-MeA is markedly elevated by the removal of the lesion by Mag1 in strains that cannot repair the resulting abasic sites because of the absence of AP endonuclease activity. The data also suggest that Me-lex may represent a useful model for the design of highly cytotoxic but weakly mutagenic antineoplastic agents.

Collectively, these data suggest that an initial modification of the gluconeogenic rate is followed by compensatory changes in the glycogenolytic rate, thus maintaining a constant EGP.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in contrast to DAB, which had no effect on glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes (12Andersen B. Rassov A. Westergaard N. Lundgren K. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 543-548Crossref Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the effects of DAB on the gluconeogenic pathway using lactate and glycerol as substrates as well as the effects of DAB on glycogen synthesis and gluconeogenic substrate cycling through glycogen as assessed by NMR methodology in the systems of primary hepatocytes, perfused rat liver, and lactate-clamped ratsin vivo. We conclude that inhibition of glycogenolysis with DAB has no effect on gluconeogenesis from lactate or glycerol or on glycogen synthesis, thus suggesting that inhibition of glycogenolysis may prove beneficial for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Møllegård Breeding Centre (Denmark). Prior to the experiments, animals were housed at ∼25 °C and constant humidity and subjected to a standard light (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.)/dark (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.) cycle and free access to normal rat chow and water. Rat hepatocytes were prepared essentially as described by Grunnet et al. (30Grunnet N. Jensen S. Dich J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The isolated cells, of which more than 85% excluded trypan blue, were suspended in basal medium (Medium 199; Invitrogen) containing glucose (5.5 mm) supplemented with fetal calf serum (4%; Invitrogen), insulin (1 nm; Novo Nordisk A/S), and dexamethasone (100 nm; Merck). The cell suspension (1 ml of 0.33 million/ml suspension) was plated onto collagen-coated (Sigma) 12-well Petri dishes (NUNC A/S) or 60-mm Petri dishes (4 ml of 0.55 million/ml suspension) for NMR studies. After 3 h, the medium was changed to a medium with a composition as described above except that the serum was omitted. To study the effect of DAB on glycogenolysis, medium was changed after 24 h to basal medium containing 15 mm glucose or [1-13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) for NMR experiments and 10 nm insulin in order to build up glycogen stores. After an additional 20-h incubation under these conditions, the hepatocytes were washed twice with prewarmed buffer A (pH 7.4 at 37 °C) containing NaCl (117.6 mm), KCl (5.4 mm), Mg2SO4 (0.82 mm), KH2PO4 (1.5 mm), HEPES (20 mm), NaHCO3 (9 mm), human serum albumin (0.1% w/v), and CaCl2 (2.25 mm) and subsequently incubated in 1 or 3 ml (60-mm dishes) of buffer A in the presence or absence of 3 mm glycerol or [2-13C]glycerol (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) for the NMR experiments, with or without 0–25 μm DAB (Novo Nordisk A/S) and with or without 1–2.0 nm glucagon (Novo Nordisk A/S) for 3 h. Basal and glucagon-stimulated glycogenolysis was measured as glucose (see assay below) released into buffer A. Glycogen levels were determined after washing the cells twice with ice-cold saline and by using amyloglucosidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) digestion and subsequent glucose measurement as above (31Kunst A. Draeger B. Ziegenhorn J. Bergmayer H.U. Bergmayer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. II. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 154Google Scholar). Lactate in the medium was determined by using the Sigma lactate reagent. For the NMR experiments, 250 μl of the hepatocyte incubation medium was first taken to determine glucose and lactate as above. The remaining 2750 μl was lyophilized and redissolved in 500 μl of phosphate buffer (6.7 mm, pH 7.4) containing sodium (trimethylsilyl)-d-4-propionate (TSP) (20 mm; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as an internal standard and D2O (10%; 99 atom % deuterium; Aldrich) for NMR analysis. For cellular glycogen content, the cells were first hydrolyzed in 750 μl of amyloglucosidase buffer, of which 500 μl was then lyophilized and redissolved for NMR spectroscopy as described above for the medium samples. Samples were transferred to 96-well plates for automated flow injection NMR analysis. Gradient selected one-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra were acquired at 600.13 MHz 1H frequency on a Bruker DRX600 instrument (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) equipped with a 160-μl single cell-selective inverse flow injection (1H,13C) z-gradient probe head (Bruker). The sample was placed in the flow cell by means of a Gilson 215 liquid handler robot (Gilson Inc., Middleton, WI). The13C content in positions 1 and 2 of glucose and positions 2 and 3 of lactate was measured by recording the integral values of the corresponding 1H signals relative to the integral of the TSP peak in the one-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra (39Hansen S.H. McCormack J.G. NMR Biomed. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Absolute quantification was performed by acquiring one-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra of glucose and lactate reference samples of known concentrations, and enrichment was calculated from the total pool sizes determined by biochemical assays or by 1H NMR spectroscopy. We observed a good correlation between the NMR method and the biochemical method (data not shown). The rats were kept as described above. Fed female Sprague-Dawley rats (8–10 weeks, 218 ± 13 g) were divided into six groups (n = 5/group), and the livers were perfused as described below. Rats were anesthetized with 3.5 ml/kg of a freshly prepared mixture containing 100 μl of Hypnorm (Jansson Cilag) and 100 μl of Dormicum (local pharmacy), and 200 μl of H2O and livers were perfused in situ through the portal vein at a constant flow rate of 18 ml/min with a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer equilibrated with O2/CO2 (19:1) to a pH of the perfusate at 7.4 at 37 °C (32Exton J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 39: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After 10 min of preperfusion, the experiment was initiated at t = 0 by a change to an equilibrated Krebs-Ringer buffer containing lactate (1.67 mm), pyruvate (0.33 mm), insulin (10 microunits/ml), glucagon (88 pg/ml), and [6-3H]glucose (0.03 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences), with or without DAB (2.5 μm) and at three glucose concentrations (0, 5, or 20 mm) (i.e. in six groups). The low insulin/glucagon ratio used has previously been reported to stimulate net glucose output in perfused rat liver (33Shiota M. Green R. Colburn C.A. Mitchell G. Cherrington A.D. Metabolism. 1996; 45: 481-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Livers were perfused in a nonrecirculating set-up, and samples of 2 ml were drawn simultaneously from the inflow and outflow of the liver att = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 min. Att = 40 min, 0.1 μCi/ml [U-14C]lactate (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the Krebs-Ringer buffer, and the perfusion was changed to a recirculating set-up (200 ml). Samples of 2 ml were drawn from the inflow and outflow of the liver att = 43, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, and 70 min. A steady-state period was defined as the average of values fromt = 61–70 min, where conditions were assumed to be constant. Perfusate samples were collected on ice and stored at −80 °C for later analysis. Finally, at t = 70 min, the liver was rapidly excised, freeze-clamped in N2 and stored at −80 °C for later analysis. The rats were kept as described above. Four groups of male weight-matched Sprague-Dawley rats aged 10–12 weeks were studied: group 1, fasted, DAB-treated (n = 9, weight 352 ± 11 g expressed as mean ± S.D.); group 2, fasted, vehicle (n = 9, 354 ± 11 g); group 3, fed, DAB-treated (n = 8, 361 ± 14 g); and group 4, fed, vehicle (n = 9, 367 ± 11 g). At the day of the experiment, the rats were anesthetized with isofluran, and two catheters were implanted. One catheter was set in the right vena jugularis for infusion (sp210 syringe pump; World Precision Instruments, Aston, UK) of somatostatin (SRIF), insulin, and lactate/pyruvate. A second catheter was set in the right vena femoralis for infusion of donor erythrocytes (hematocrit 62 ± 5% in PBS buffer; 7.1 ± 0.2 ml) and DAB or vehicle. After surgery, the animals were rested for 30 min before the start of infusions. At t = −45 min, a continuous infusion of somatostatin (4 μg/kg * min) was given for suppression of endogenous insulin production, and a basal replacement infusion of insulin (0.4 milliunits/kg * min) was given. Also, a variable infusion of lactate/pyruvate (5:1, 1.25 m, 30%13C-enriched in C-3 in lactate) was started to clamp plasma lactate levels at 5 mm. At t = 0, following this equilibration period of 45 min, the test period was started with a primed infusion of DAB (1.38 mg/kg + 13.1 μg/kg * min) or saline (vehicle). The selected dose of DAB (1.97 mg/kg) was based on preliminary experiments in rats to obtain a constant plasma concentration of 5 μmDAB. 2P. McKay and L. Yndal, unpublished observation. Blood was drawn every third minute for analysis of glucose and lactate and further att = 0, 7.5, 15, 30, and 45 min for the measurement of NMR parameters. Blood was also drawn every 6 min untilt = 0 and further at t = 7.5, 12, 15, 21, 27, 30, 33, 39, and 45 min for determination of insulin. Blood was collected in EDTA-coated tubes and centrifuged immediately (Eppendorf centrifuge 5417 R; Radiometer). Plasma was either kept on ice and processed the same day or kept at −80 °C until assayed. Finally, att = 45, the liver was rinsed with saline injected through the portal vein, excised, freeze-clamped in N2, and stored at t = −80 °C for later analysis. The outline of the infusion protocol is shown in Fig. 3. In order to evaluate the DAB infusion protocol, the following control experiment was performed. Fed rats were infused with or without DAB as outlined above, and then at t = 45, the animals received an intraperitoneal injection of glucagon (10 μg/kg), and blood samples were taken every 5 min until t = 90. The result is shown later in Fig. 3 B. Blood glucose and lactate were measured on-line with a dual glucose/lactate analyzer (YSI 2300 STAT; Yellow Springs Instrument Co.). Insulin was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method based on two murine monoclonal antibodies that bind to different epitopes on the insulin molecule (34Andersen L. Dinesen B. Jørgensen P.N. Poulsen F. Røder M.E. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Inflow and outflow perfusate samples were placed on a tandem column of 1 ml of cation exchanger (Dowex 50; Sigma) over 2 ml of anion binder (Dowex 1-X8 100–200 mesh (acetate); Sigma) for separation of [14C]glucose from [14C]lactate and counted in a scintillation counter (Tri-carb 4530; Packard Instrument Co.). The anion exchanger in the chloride form was exchanged to the acetate form by subsequent treatment with 0.5 m NaOH and 0.2 m HAc prior to the assay. The glycogen contents of the freeze-clamped liver samples were determined enzymatically as μmol of glycosyl units per gram of wet weight after boiling the tissue in 0.4n KOH and subsequent degradation of glycogen with amyloglucosidase (35Katz J. Golden S. Wals P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Glycogen concentrations are expressed as molar glycosyl units based on absolute hydrolysis of the used glycogen batch. 3H and 14C in glycogen was determined by boiling tissue samples in 0.4n KOH. Glycogen was precipitated by the addition of ethanol to 70% (v/v). After 2 h on ice, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed twice by 70% ethanol, and hydrolyzed by boiling for 2 h with 0.2 m sulfuric acid. Radioactivity in the hydrolysate was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Plasma samples were centrifuged, and 200 μl was transferred to 96-well plates. Phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH = 7.4, 200 μl) containing TSP (50 mm) as internal reference was added. Gradient-selected one-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence experiments were acquired as described for the hepatocyte medium samples (39Hansen S.H. McCormack J.G. NMR Biomed. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and the 13C content in position 1 in glucose and position 3 in lactate was measured. A steady state period was defined att = 61–70 min by averaging values obtained att = 61, 64, 67, and 70 min, and a two-way analysis of variance (Prism 3.0) was used to test for the effects of DAB and glucose on all rat liver outcome variables. An unpaired Student'st test was used to compare steady-state periods when significance was reached by analysis of variance assuming two-sample unequal variance. The study groups were compared by a two-way analysis of variance (Prism 3.0) and subjected to an unpaired Student's t test when significance was reached by analysis of variance assuming two-sample unequal variance. Fig. 1shows the effects of DAB on glucose release and lactate release and glycogen content in cultured rat hepatocytes incubated under the basal or glucagon-stimulated condition and in the absence or presence of 3 mm glycerol. Data are expressed relative to basal conditions in the absence of DAB, which equals 100%. Glucose release (Fig. 1 A) was inhibited dose-dependently by DAB under basal conditions to about 30% of the initial value. Glucagon increased the glucose release 2.7-fold, and this could be inhibited by DAB to 57%, which was significantly above the basal condition (p < 0.05). The addition of glycerol increased the glucose release 2.5-fold alone and 5.2-fold in the presence of glucagon compared with the basal conditions. DAB did not inhibit glucose release in the presence of glycerol, with or without glucagon, to the level seen in the absence of glycerol (p < 0.05). Glucagon decreased lactate release (Fig. 1 B) to 50–70% of the initial value without DAB. However, independently of glucagon, DAB was not able to inhibit lactate release to the same extent with glycerol as without glycerol. In the absence of DAB, the glycogen content (Fig.1 C) fell from the initial value of 312% to 100% under basal conditions and 50% in the presence of glucagon independent of glycerol. The addition of DAB under all incubation conditions dose-dependently prevented glycogen degradation up to 225–275%, corresponding to 70–85% of the initial value (312%). Cells were preincubated with [1-13C]glucose to build up the 13C-labeled glycogen content and subsequently incubated under basal or glucagon-stimulated conditions and with 3 mm[2-13C]glycerol. C-1-labeled glucose and C-3-labeled lactate in the medium are derived from C-1-labeled glucose residues in glycogen, whereas glucose and lactate labeled in the C-2 position are derived from C-2-labeled glycerol (39Hansen S.H. McCormack J.G. NMR Biomed. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). This therefore allowed us to study the effect of DAB on glucose production from gluconeogenesis (from glycerol) and from glycogenolysis in a more detailed manner and simultaneously. The effect of 20 μm DAB on total glucose, lactate, and glycogen content (Table I) corresponded well with the data presented in Fig. 1 with a few exceptions. DAB clearly inhibited the release of [1-13C]glucose but noticeably not [2-13C]glucose into the medium to the same extent under basal or glucagon-stimulated conditions with glycerol. Also, the amount of [3-13C]lactate released into the incubation medium was inhibited by DAB, with a more pronounced effect under stimulated conditions. DAB did not inhibit the release of [2-13C]lactate (p = not significant); however, the presence of glucagon reduced the amount of [2-13C]lactate released (p < 0.05). Stimulation of hepatocytes with glucagon caused less [1-13C]glucose to be retained in glycogen, corresponding with increased amounts of labeled glucose in the medium. However, DAB retained 1-13C-labeled glucose in glycogen to the same extent under basal and stimulated conditions, and enrichment of the C-1 position in glycogen was independent of the presence of glucagon and DAB. No enrichment at the C-2 position was found in glycogen (data not shown).Table IEffect of DAB on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in primary rat hepatocytesTotal GluTotal Lac[1-13C]Glu[2-13C]Glu[2-13C]Lac[3-13C]Lacnmol/mg proteinMediumBasal2059.3 ± 172.11295.2 ± 343.8913.0 ± 128.4410.0 ± 22.9438.0 ± 111.0185.4 ± 56.5(44.3 ± 6.2)(19.9 ± 1.1)(33.5 ± 2.7)(14.3 ± 1.8)Basal + DAB885.3 ± 106.2**570.8 ± 98.1142.4 ± 13.9***461.3 ± 37.2247.0 ± 67.345.0 ± 8.3*(16.1 ± 1.6)(52.1 ± 4.2)(43.2 ± 5.1)(7.4 ± 1.0)Stim3124.7 ± 335.8567.9 ± 110.01362.6 ± 173.7699.3 ± 46.6140.1 ± 37.479.9 ± 22.7(43.6 ± 5.6)(22.4 ± 1.5)(24.6 ± 3.3)(14.1 ± 1.7)Stim + DAB1184.6 ± 156.0***292.4 ± 11.7*182.5 ± 19.7***630.8 ± 47.564.7 ± 12.827.3 ± 3.1*(15.4 ± 1.7)(53.3 ± 4.0)(22.1 ± 3.3)(9.3 ± 1.0)CellBasal1804.4 ± 323.4922.6 ± 186(51.1 ± 10.3)Basal + DAB3434.2 ± 547.6*1854.5 ± 319.2*(54.0 ± 9.3)Stim1135.6 ± 261.6567.6 ± 100.1(50.0 ± 8.9)Stim + DAB3381.4 ± 452.6**1866.0 ± 276.9**(55.2 ± 8.2)Cells were incubated 24 h with [1-13C]glucose to build up a 13C-labeled glycogen pool.

Novel drug targets are urgently being sought as multidrug resistance limits the range of treatment options for this protozoan pathogen. PfHT1, the major hexose transporter of P. falciparum is a promising new target. We report detailed structure-function studies on PfHT1 using site-directed mutagenesis approaches on residues located in helix V (Q169N) and helix VII (302SGL → AGT). Studies with hexose analogues in these mutants have established that hexose recognition and permeation are intimately linked to these helices. A “fructose filter” effect results from the Q169N mutation (abolishing fructose uptake but preserving affinity and transport of glucose, as reported in Woodrow, C. J., Burchmore, R. J.

Associated changes in competition for glucose uptake by C-2, C-3, and C-6 glucose analogues compared with native PfHT1 indicate subtle alterations in substrate interaction in this mutant. The Km values for glucose uptake in helix VII mutants are also similar to native PfHT1.

Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 208-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Multidrug resistant parasites are now established in many parts of the world, limiting significantly the range of chemotherapeutic options. Antimalarial vaccines are still some years away from being useful (2Nosten F. van Vugt M. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 1996; 9: 429-434Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of the P. falciparum hexose transporter, PfHT11 (3Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), has provided a new avenue for drug target development based on the following facts. First, intra-erythrocytic P. falciparum depends totally on glucose from its host for energy (4Kirk K. Horner H.A. Kirk J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Parasites increase glucose consumption of erythrocytes by up to 100-fold and cannot tolerate decreased extracellular glucose concentrations without suffering immediate falls in intraparasitic pH (4Kirk K. Horner H.A. Kirk J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The uptake of glucose by parasites is likely to be solely via PfHT1, because it is encoded by a single copy gene with no close paralogues (5Woodrow C.J. Burchmore R.J.S. Krishna S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9931-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mRNA for PfHT1 is expressed during the ring stage of parasite development in anticipation of large increases in demands for glucose by trophozoites. PfHT1 has a relatively high affinity for hexoses with a 10-fold higher affinity for d-glucose compared with the major mammalian erythrocyte and cerebral blood vessel glucose transporter, GLUT1 (3Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Krishna S. Woodrow C.J. Cardew G. Transport and Trafficking in the Malaria-infected Erythrocyte. 226. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, London1999: 126-144Google Scholar). PfHT1 also transports fructose in contrast to mammalian facilitative hexose transporters (GLUTs), which generally transport either glucose or fructose. No structural information is available for PfHT1; therefore, indirect approaches are needed to identify key amino acid residues responsible for PfHT1-hexose interactions. Mutagenesis approaches have been extensively applied to GLUT1 and include glycosylation-scanning (7Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol.

Results have provided insight into secondary and tertiary structures of GLUT1 and their role in determining substrate selectivity (12Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A key insight into the hexose permeation pathway of mammalian GLUTs has developed from the observation that GLUTs 1, 3, and 4 transport glucose only and all contain a conserved QLS motif in helix VII, whereas GLUTs 2 and 5 are capable of fructose transport and do not have this conserved motif (11Seatter M.J., De La Rue S. Porter L.M. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Chimeric GLUT2/GLUT3 constructs confirm that fructose selectivity depends in part on the QLS motif in helix VII (13Arbuckle M.I. Kane S. Porter L.M. Seatter M.J. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16519-16527Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In GLUT1, helix VII is also important in exofacial binding because mutations reduce affinity for exofacial site-specific ligands 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) benzoyl-1,3-bis(d-mannos-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine (ATB-BMPA) and 4,6-O-ethylidene-α-d-glucose (13Arbuckle M.I.

Tobe K. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Holman G. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these observations, in PfHT1 helix V is clearly critical for fructose transport, since this is selectively ablated by a single amino acid (Q169N) mutation in this helix (5Woodrow C.J. Burchmore R.J.S. Krishna S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9931-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Affinity for glucose as well as uptake is preserved in this mutant, indicating that different mechanisms might determine hexose selectivity in the mammalian and parasite transporters. In another pathogenic protozoan, Trypanosoma brucei, the hexose transporter THT1 can also transport both glucose and fructose with an affinity for 2-deoxy-d-glucose that is comparable to that of PfHT1 (Km ∼0.5 mm) whereas its affinity for fructose is higher (Ki ∼2.6 mm) than that of PfHT1 (Ki ∼11 mm) (15Tetaud E. Bringaud F. Chabas S. Barrett M.P. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8278-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies substituting the PfHT1 helix VII 302SGL by the GLUT1 equivalent (QLS) did not result in measurable glucose uptake (data not shown). We have therefore changed this PfHT1 helix VII302SGL motif to that found in the corresponding region of helix VII in THT1 (302SGL → AGT, see Fig. 1) Additional single mutations (S302A and L304T) within the helix VII SGL motif in PfHT1 are included to establish more precisely the contribution of individual amino acids to substrate-protein interaction. A detailed kinetic analysis of the previously described helix V mutant Q169N is also presented to differentiate the roles of these two helices with respect to fructose transport and substrate-transporter interactions. Recently, a three-dimensional model of GLUT1 has been published describing a helical arrangement that is consistent with experimental observations as well as theoretical structural considerations (16Zuniga F.A. Shi G. Haller J.F. Rubashkin A. Flynn D.R. Iserovich P. Fischbarg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44970-44975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This model predicts two transport channels, both of them partially limited by the QLS motif in helix VII. We have now combined our site-directed mutagenesis studies with similar molecular modeling of PfHT1 to increase our understanding of the hexose permeation pathway of this important parasite transporter. PfHT1 helix VII mutants were created using a nested PCR strategy. Complementary PCR primers (Table I) were designed to introduce a double point-mutated construct of amino acids Ser302 and Leu304 to produce 302SGL → AGT and single point-mutated S302A and L304T constructs with wild type PfHT1 DNA as template using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA; Table I for primer sequences). Restriction sites for confirmation of mutations were included directly over the mutated site. HTKB primers (hexose transporter primers containingKozak and BglII site) used for the amplification of the full-length product includeBglII restriction sites at their 5′-ends, and the forward primer (HTKB1) includes a strong eukaryotic Kozak consensus in front of the start codon (CACCATG). The resulting PCR products were ligated into the pSP vector containing 5′- and 3′-untranslatedXenopus β-globin sequences as previously described (17Gould G. Lienhard G.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9447-9452Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All products were verified by sequence analysis.Table ISequences of primers used in nested PCR as described in methodsPrimer namePrimer sequence (5′ → 3′)Restriction sitesfAGTGGATGTTTGCTAGCTGGTACACAACAATTTACAGGNheIrAGTCCTGTAAATTGTTGTGTACCAGCTAGCAAACATCCfAGLGGATGTTTGCTAGCTGGTCTGCAGCAATTTACAGNheI, PstIrAGLCTGTAAATTGCTGCAGACCAGCTAGCAAACATCCfSGTGGATGTTTGCTATCTGGTACCCAACAATTTACAGKpnIrSGTCTGTAAATTGTTGGGTACCAGATAGCAAACATCCfHTKBACGTACAGATCTCACCATGACGAAAAGTTCGAAAGBglIIrHTKBACGTACAGATCTTCATACAACCGACTTGGTC Open table in a new tab Xenopus oocytes were assayed as previously described (3Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol.

Uptake assays were performed at room temperature for 20 min, 24–96 h after injection on groups of 6–8 oocytes in Barth's medium containing permeant d-[U-14C]glucose (310 mCi·mmol−1), 2-deoxy-d-[U-14C]glucose (2-DOG; 58 mCi·mmol−1), 3-O-[14C]methyl-d-glucose (3-OMG) (50 mCi·mmol−1), ord-[U-14C]fructose (289 mCi·mmol−1) from Amersham Biosciences). All uptakes were linear for the times used in these assays. Uptakes of substrate after correction for uptakes in water-injected controls were assayed in experiments with incubation times and experimental conditions as previously described (3Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A Michaelis-Menten model (PRISM Ver. 2, Graphpad, San Diego) was used for all estimations of kinetic parameters by non-linear regression analysis. All studies with competitors were carried out 24–48 h after injection for 20 min in Barth's medium containing radiolabeled d-glucose (2.69 μm, 323 mCi·mmol−1d-[U-14C]glucose and 35 μmunlabeled d-glucose) and varying amounts of competitor (all from Sigma). Results were analyzed with PRISM using a one-site competition model. To determine the degree of correspondence between the helical assignments for the GLUT1 structure and PfHT1, we analyzed amino acid sequence similarities between the GLUT family (isoforms 1–5), three trypanosomatid transporters and PfHT1. We first performed an alignment between all sequences (ClustalW) (18Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar) and then used the program TMpred (19Pasquier C. Promponas V.J. Palaios G.A. Hamodrakas J.S. Hamodrakas S.J. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) to predict in each sequence the location of the transmembrane regions. The putative PfHT1 structure was modeled by homology, using the three-dimensional model for GLUT1 (16Zuniga F.A. Shi G. Haller J.F. Rubashkin A. Flynn D.R. Iserovich P. Fischbarg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44970-44975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1JA5) as a template. The GLUT1 model and its validation have been described in detail. We used the SwissModel module from the program Swiss-PDB Viewer (vs. 3.5) to align the GLUT1 and the PfHT1 (Swiss Protein Data Base O97467) sequences. We then obtained an improved alignment by including gaps and matching in both sequences the corresponding conserved and semi-conserved amino acids using the program ClustalW (18Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar). Subsequently, these gaps were manually introduced into the alignment in the Swiss-PDB environment. This resulted in a tentative structure for PfHT1, which presented five gap regions (between PfHT1 residues 19–32, 190–201, 207–208, 278–279 and 326) all located in loops. We utilized a Silicon Graphics Octane work station with InsightII software (Accelrys Inc.). Using the Biopolymer module, we loaded the tentative structure for PfHT1, added the missing amino acids in the gaps, and performed energy minimization using the Discovery module (CVFF force field; 200 iterations with the steepest descent algorithm, and 500 more with the conjugate gradient algorithm). Subsequently, we verified that the residues in the helical segments still fell in allowed Ramachandran regions, and we turned to refining the loop regions using the Swiss-PDB Viewer. We searched for homologous loops with best Ramachandran conformations, avoiding bad contacts and undesirable torsion angles. For each new loop we performed a few steps of energy minimization (GROMOS 43b1 force field; 20 iterations with the steepest descent algorithm). Finally, we performed an energy minimization of the whole protein (in vacuum) using the Discovery module as above, so as to optimize close contacts, bond distances, and angles. Fig. 1 confirms that there are no major differences between helical assignments for different mammalian and parasite transporters, suggesting a good deal of structural conservation between them. For helices V, VII, and VIII, known to be important for the transport of substrates in human GLUTs, the assigned locations are mostly the same, and all conserved amino acids fall inside transmembrane regions as well. This is true also for helices II, III, IV, IX, X, XI, and XII. Only for helices I and VI are there differences in the relative positions of transmembrane regions between GLUTs and the trypanosomatid transporters of T. brucei, T. vivax, and T. cruzi. In contrast to the trypanosomatid sequences, helices for PfHT1 are located in well conserved regions that also align well with those of GLUTs. This reinforced our impression that helical structures of PfHT1 were in positions that corresponded to those in GLUT1 well enough to pursue further development of a putative PfHT1 structure. The PfHT1 structure obtained is depicted in Fig.2 (PDB 1LVI). The quality of this structure was determined using PROCHECK (version 3.3.2) (20Laskowki R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The distribution thus found for the φ/ψ angles was as follows: core regions, 76.4% (349 aa); allowed regions, 22.5% (103 aa); generously allowed regions, 1.1% (5 amino acids); and disallowed regions, 0%. In contrast to GLUT1, the N-terminal region of PfHT1 is longer, placing it relatively much closer to the C terminus. Interestingly, whereas most loop lengths are similar between GLUT1 and PfHT1, the extracellular loop between helices V and VI is 14 residues longer than in GLUT1 and has a preponderance of polar residues. Fig. 3 places residues that have been mutated in this and previous studies within the hypothetical structure of PfHT1. As in GLUT1, both a main and auxiliary channel are predicted and shown in the plane of the SGL motif that has been mutated in helix VII in PfHT1. The main channel is predicted to act as a conduit for sugars, with the auxiliary channel perhaps permitting also passage of non-sugar substrates. Likewise, QLS in helix VII of GLUT1 is also predicted to contact both channels (Ref. 16Zuniga F.A. Shi G. Haller J.F. Rubashkin A. Flynn D.R. Iserovich P. Fischbarg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44970-44975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and see below). Gln169 is predicted to lie in the same horizontal plane and in the vicinity of the SGL motif, but as shown here, points away from the main channel. After dynamic analysis (Fig.4), the Asn mutant side chain (one methylene shorter than the original Gln) appears displaced inwards, as if packed more compactly. However, this new arrangement appears to result in a displacement of helix IV away from the recognition site and the main channel. By contrast, the positions of helices VII and VIII do not change much. The Q169N mutant can therefore be envisaged to lead to alterations in a critical hydrogen bond that perturbs the binding of fructose and not of glucose, as we have previously observed experimentally (5Woodrow C.J. Burchmore R.J.S. Krishna S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9931-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Reconfiguration of the triplet motif (SGL) in helix VII of PfHT1 to an equivalent motif (AGL) found in THT1, a T. bruceihexose transporter (21Barrett M.P. Tetaud E. Seyfang A. Bringaud F. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Protozool. 1998; 91: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), resulted in approximately half the overall uptake rates for d-glucose when compared with native PfHT1, 48 h after microinjection of equivalent concentrations of cRNA (mean ± S.E. values for uptake were 77.4 ± 5.9 pmol/oocyte/h for PfHT1 and 42.3 ± 2.4 pmol/oocyte/h for the302SGL → AGT construct). The double point mutation in the above construct was segregated to produce two new mutants S302A and L304T in order to examine if a single amino acid within the triple motif construct was responsible for functional changes. Uptake measurements with the same batch of oocytes as before confirmed that both single amino acid mutations were functional at levels comparable to the 302SGL → AGT mutant (at 48 hd-glucose uptake values were 48.3 ± 6.2 and 35.9 ± 3.9 pmol/oocyte/h, respectively) when injected with equivalent amounts of cRNA. These uptake rates were ample enough to allow the more detailed kinetic analyses that follow. Table II summarizesKm values of mutants of PfHT1 for different substrates and compares these to values previously obtained for native PfHT1. The mutation 302SGL → AGT in helix VII does not alter the affinity for d-glucose (mean ± S.E.Km = 1.3 ± 0.3 mm for the mutant compared with a wild type Km = 1.0 ± 0.2 mm). The segregated helix VII mutants S302A and L304T also show similar affinities for d-glucose (Km = 0.47 ± 0.1 mm and 0.68 ± 0.04 mm, respectively).Table IIKinetic analysis with operative analogues on helix V and VII mutantsSubstratePfHT12-aPreviously reported data.Q169N302SGL → AGTS302AL304TAldose analoguesd-glucoseKm = 1.0 ± 0.2Km = 1.2 ± 0.22-aPreviously reported data.Km = 1.3 ± 0.3Km = 0.47 ± 0.1Km = 0.68 ± 0.04(n = 4)C-1 position1-deoxy-d-glucoseKi = 15.312-bMean of two independent experiments.Ki = 13.6 ± 2Ki = 32 ± 6.4Ki = 32.7, 20.5Ki = 19 ± 2.1C-2 position2-deoxy-d-glucoseKm = 1.3Km = 3.4 ± 0.3Km = 5, 2.2Ki = 0.7 ± 0.15Ki = 1.2 ± 0.3C-3 position3-O-methyl-d-glucoseKm = 1.3 ± 0.3Km = 7.3, 5.5Km = 4.5 ± 0.8Ki = 2, 12-bMean of two independent experiments.Ki = 1.2 ± 0.2Ki = 1.0 ± 0.1C-5 position5-thio-d-glucoseKi = 3.22-bMean of two independent experiments.Ki = 0.7, 0.8Ki = 14 ± 2.7Ki = 11.2 ± 1.6Ki = 4, 5.9C-6 position6-deoxy-d-glucoseKi = 2.2 ± 0.9Ki = 9.3, 6.4Ki = 6.8 ± 1Ki = 3.9 ± 1.6Ki = 3.8 ± 0.7Ketose analoguesd-FructoseKm = 11.5 ± 1.6No transportKm = 12.5 ± 2.0Ki = 11.22-bMean of two independent experiments.Ki = 19.7 ± 4.3Ki = 19.9 ± 1.7Ki = 17.1 ± 3C-2 position2,5-anhydro-d-mannitolKi = 1.4 ± 0.3Ki = 282-aPreviously reported data.Ki = 1.7 ± 0.15Ki = 2.2, 1.2Ki = 2.7, 1.02-a Previously reported data.2-b Mean of two independent experiments. Open table in a new tab The affinity of d-fructose for the 302SGL → AGT mutant (Km = 12.5 ± 2, Table II) is similar to its affinity for native PfHT1 (Km = 11.5 ± 1.6). The Ki for fructose for the mutant is higher but this difference is not significant (Ki = 19.7 ± 4.3; p = 0.19). The segregated helix VII mutants S302A and L304T haveKi values for d-fructose comparable to the AGT mutant (Ki = 19.9 ± 1.7 mmand 17.1 ± 3.0 mm). Results for substrate transport for the Q169N helix V mutant have been published previously (fructose uptake is abolished whereas glucose uptake is preserved with an affinity similar to that of native PfHT1, Ref. 5Woodrow C.J. Burchmore R.J.S. Krishna S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9931-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Deoxy-d-glucose (DOG) analogues provide insight into the interactions of six possible hydrogen bonding sites on glucose with PfHT1 (or GLUT1). These potential hydrogen-bonding sites are interrupted by removal of the hydroxyl group (on carbons 1–4 and 6) and by replacing the oxygen on C-5 with a sulfur atom. Previous studies with PfHT1 showed hydrogen bonding to be important at positions C-1 and C-3 with ≥10-fold increase in Ki observed with 1-DOG (Ki ∼15 mm) and 3-DOG (Ki ∼15 mm) when compared withd-glucose (Km ∼1 mm) (5Woodrow C.J. Burchmore R.J.S. Krishna S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9931-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For the helix V Q169N mutation, no change in Ki was observed for 1-DOG (mean Ki = 13.6 mm) compared with the Ki for 1-DOG measured in native PfHT1 (see above). An almost 4-fold decrease inKi for 5-thio-d-glucose was observed for the Q169N mutant (mean Ki = 0.75 mm) compared with wild type (Ki = 3.2 mm). A 4-fold increase was observed in the Ki for 6-DOG when compared with the corresponding Km orKi values for PfHT1 (Table II). DOG studies on the helix VII 302SGL → AGT mutation showed slightly higher Ki values than observed for native PfHT1 for d-glucose positions C-1 (2-fold increase inKi) and C-6 (3-fold increase inKi; p = 0.026). TheKm for 2-DOG was increased ∼3-fold (meanKm = 3.6 mmversus 1.3 mm). Assay of the S302A mutation suggests that the 2-fold increase inKi with 1-DOG seen in the 302SGL → AGT mutant can mostly be attributed to this single point mutation (meanKi = 27 mm, Table II)) and not to the second change (L304T, mean Ki = 19 mm). The Ki values for 2-DOG obtained for S302A and L304T mutants are similar to the Kmvalue for 2-DOG obtained for native PfHT1. The Kis observed for C-5 and C-6 analogues (5-thio-d-glucose and 6-DOG) for the S302A and L304T mutants were higher than for native PfHT1 and additionally synergized to decrease affinity for both analogues in the 302SGL → AGT mutant. The helix VII Q169N mutation reduces the affinity for 3-OMG (mean Km = 6.4 mm) compared with the wild type (mean Km = 1.3 mm), suggesting increased hydrophobic interactions of this mutant with the C3 methyl group. The 302SGL → AGT mutant has a significantly higher Km value (meanKm = 4.5 mm) for 3-OMG compared with wild type PfHT1 (mean Km = 1.3 mm;p = 0.024). The Ki values for S302A and L304T are not significantly different (mean Kivalues = 1.2 and 1, respectively) compared with native PfHT1, suggesting both mutations act together to increase theKi for 3-OMG in the 302SGL → AGT mutant. As PfHT1 transports d-fructose in its furanose form, 2,5-AHM (2,5-anhydro-d-mannitol), a fixed fructofuranose analogue, was used to assess interactions with mutants (5Woodrow C.J. Burchmore R.J.S. Krishna S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9931-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Previous work established that helix V Q169N mutation abolished fructose transport. All three helix VII mutants showed similarKi values to native PfHT1 for 2,5-AHM (Table II). These findings are consistent with kinetic data for fructose itself and suggest that fructose is also transported by helix VII mutants of PfHT1 in the furanose configuration. Without crystallographic data, information relating structure and function in facilitative hexose transporters relies upon indirect approaches such as mutagenesis, the use of analogues, and molecular modeling. In this work we have used all three approaches to examine the importance of a triple amino acid motif located in helix VII and a single amino acid mutation in helix V, in permeation of hexoses. Both helices V and VII have previously been implicated in substrate binding or selectivity of glucose versus fructose in different facilitative hexose transporters (5Woodrow C.J. Burchmore R.J.S. Krishna S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9931-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Seatter M.J., De La Rue S. Porter L.M. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Arbuckle M.I. Kane S. Porter L.M. Seatter M.J. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16519-16527Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have also developed the first model for PfHT1 and examined its consistency with our experimental findings. In this model for PfHT1, two regions studied by mutagenesis (Q169N in helix V and 302SGL → AGT in helix VII) are both located in the same plane and are in proximity to the main predicted permeation channel in PfHT1 (Figs. 2 and 3). As the Q169N mutation abolishes fructose transport leaving glucose transport unaffected, perhaps the angular rotation of helix V in this model should be modified so that Gln169 faces the main channel. However, this modification is energetically unfavored (data not shown). Furthermore, our modeling of the Q169N mutant (Fig. 4) reinforces our interpretation that this mutation results in local structural changes (perhaps also involving helix IV), which may lead to the observed relative loss of fructose transport. Alteration of specific hydrogen-bond interactions with fructofuranoses in the mutant may be sufficient to explain the loss of fructose binding while glucopyranose transport is retained, in conjunction with relatively minor changes in helix VII in this mutant. Exofacial binding of GLUT1 was examined with 4,6-O-ethylidene-α-d-glucose (22Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but this compound does not compete for glucose transport by PfHT1 and cannot be used to probe exofacial binding in PfHT1 (5Woodrow C.J. Burchmore R.J.S. Krishna S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9931-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consequently, analogues of glucose were used to explore hexose permeation further. The helix V mutant showed increases in Km orKi values for 2-DOG, 3-OMG, and 6-DOG and a decreased Ki for 5-thio-d-glucose compared with native sequence PfHT1. A more recent analysis of GLUT1 structure 2Iserovich, P., Wang, L., Ma, L., Yang, H., Zuniga, F. A., Pascual, J. M., Kuang, K., De Vivo, D. C., and Fischbarg, J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277,30991–30997. places the main channel in GLUT1 between helices VII, V, VIII, and X extending to the endofacial loop region. This channel is connected to the auxiliary channel by a prolongation that crosses the endofacial loop and forms an H-like structure connected together around helix VII where the QLS motif plays a critical role by being in contact with both channels. The QLS motif is important in determining fructose versusglucose selectivity in mammalian GLUTs. To confirm that substrate selectivity for glucose versus fructose in PfHT1 is dependent primarily upon helix V, we examined three helix VII mutants (302SGL → AGT, S302A, and L304T) using 2,5-AHM, a fixed furanose analogue of d-fructose, as a sensitive measure of interaction between helix VII and fructofuranoses. There was no significant difference compared with the affinity of 2,5-AHM for native PfHT1. The Km values of all three helix VII mutants ford-glucose are similar to the wild type. Previous studies with PfHT1 showed important hydrogen bonding to glucose at positions C-1 and C-3 (5Woodrow C.J. Burchmore R.J.S. Krishna S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9931-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Studies with the helix VII AGT mutant now show that hydrogen bonding with positions C-5 and C-6 are also important because of higher Ki values for C5 and C6 analogues compared with the Km for d-glucose. Analogue studies for S302A and L304T single mutants establish that the two mutations act synergistically to alter interactions with C-5 and C-6. These mutations therefore appear to result in a different positioning (“footprint”) of glucose in the substrate occupancy site that could be due to protein conformational changes induced by the different physical properties of substituent compared with native amino acids. For example, alanine and threonine are shorter by one carbon atom than serine (Ser302) and leucine (Leu304) that they replace respectively. For S302A there is a loss of a hydroxyl group whereas for the L304T mutant there is a gain of a hydroxyl group. These substitutions may affect hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic interactions in this region. There are clearly fundamental differences in the hexose permeation pathways of P. falciparum PfHT1 and the mammalian GLUTs. From our analysis, it is likely that the capability of PfHT1 to transport fructose has evolved via a different mechanism to that employed by GLUTs 2 and 5. Thus interaction with extracellular hexoses may take place first with helix V (the “fructose” filter) and subsequently with helix VII and the main permeation channel, because the Q169N mutant selectively abolishes fructose transport but preserves glucose transport. Interactions with other C-positions in glucopyranoses are altered less importantly in this mutant. In contrast, in the helix VII mutants, interactions with fructofuranoses are preserved, whereas it is possible to map differences in interactions with certain positions of glucopyranoses compared with native PfHT1. There are also significant structural differences between GLUT1 and PfHT1 exposed by modeling studies, for example the longer and more polar extracellular loop between helices V and VI in PfHT1 compared with GLUT1, the relative proximity of the N- and C-terminal regions and the relative positioning of helix V and helix VII. These modeling studies also point to residues that may line the main permeation channel in several helices (including helices VIII and IX). Mutational studies can test these hypotheses.

https://openalex.org/W2016719710,"Activated Raf is a potent inhibitor of skeletal muscle gene transcription and myocyte formation through stimulation of downstream MAPK. However, the molecular targets of elevated MAPK with regard to myogenic repression remain elusive. We examined the effects of activated Raf on myogenin gene expression in avian myoblasts. Overexpression of activated Raf in embryonic chick myoblasts prevented myogenin gene transcription and myocyte differentiation. Treatment with PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK), restored myogenin expression but did not reinstate the myogenic program. Using a panel of myogeninpromoter deletion mutants, we were unable to identify a region within the proximal 829-bp promoter that confers responsiveness to MEK. Interestingly, our experiments identified MEF2A as a target of Raf-mediated inhibition in mouse myoblasts but not in avian myogenic cells. Embryonic myoblasts overexpressing activated Raf were unable to drive transcription from a minimal myogenin promoter reporter, containing a single E-box and MEF2 site, to levels comparable with controls. Unlike mouse myoblasts, forced expression of MEF2A did not synergistically enhance transcription from the myogeninpromoter in chick myoblasts, indicating that additional molecular determinants of the block to myogenesis exist.

The majority of these signaling cascades are associated with the activation of the membrane-localized GTPase, Ras (1Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Ras enzymatic activity is a critical component of many ligand-induced responses including those initiated by the myogenesis inhibitory growth factor FGF2 (2Fedorov Y.V. Rosenthal R.S. Olwin B.B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1301-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 3Weyman C.M. Wolfman A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1794-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, sustained Ras activity represents one of the most potent myogenic repressive agents known (4Kong Y. Johnson S.E. Taparowsky E.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5205-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 5Olson E.N. Spizz G. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2104-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The means by which activated Ras inhibits skeletal myocyte formation and muscle gene expression remains elusive. However, it is unlikely that repression is mediated by the simple activation of one of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK),1 such as Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, or ERK1/2 (6Ramocki M.B.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2521-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). One of the downstream kinase cascades responsible for transmission of Ras function includes the archetypical signaling axis Raf/MEK/MAPK (9Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1441-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Initiation of this pathway through “mis-expression” of activated Raf leads to repression of the myogenic gene program and inhibition of myocyte formation (10Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The biochemical rationale for suppression of avian skeletal myogenesis by activated alleles of Raf appears to be independent of perturbations in the inherent transcriptional activities of the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). However, Raf-initiated morphological transformation of the myoblasts is a direct consequence of increased AP-1 function (11Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27481-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MRFs have long been recognized as master control switches for induction of the skeletal muscle phenotype (12Lassar A. Munsterberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Each of the MRFs is required at distinct stages during myogenesis with myogeninassuming a critical role during terminal differentiation and myoblast fusion (13Arnold H.-H. Braun T. J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 40: 345-363PubMed Google Scholar). Mice devoid of myogenin direct a full complement of cells that are located in the appropriate muscle-forming regions (14Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H.

However, the majority of the cells fail to fuse into the multinucleate myocytes capable of contractile protein synthesis. Control of myogenin gene expression requires both E-box-binding factors such as MyoD and myocyte enhancer-binding factor 2C (MEF2C) (17Edmondson D. Cheng T.-C. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). cis elements for these two transcription factors reside within the minimal promoter region of themyogenin gene, and deletion of either site in the mouse gene results in a severe reduction in myogenin expression (17Edmondson D. Cheng T.-C. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar,19Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because myogenin is critical for full differentiation of the myocyte and overexpression of activated kinases often leads to loss of MRF gene expression (20Konieczny S.F. Drobes B.L. Menke S.L. Taparowsky E.J. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lassar A.B. Thayer M.J. Overell R.W. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we reasoned that Raf signaling pathways may inhibit skeletal myogenesis by disruption of myogeninexpression and function. In this report, we find that activated Raf suppresses myogenin expression in avian myoblasts and that this repression is achieved by MEK activation. One of the downstream inhibitory targets of Raf signaling is the transcription factor MEF2. Overexpression of MEF2A reverses the negative effects of activated Raf on myogenin reporter gene expression in mouse myoblasts. However, additional transcriptional intermediates are involved in full repression of myogenin gene expression by Raf kinase as MEF2C overexpression is unable to fully overcome the detrimental effects of the Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling module. Expression plasmids coding for Myc-tagged activated human Raf (pCS2+MT shuttle Raf BXB (CMV-Raf BXB), pCS2+MT shuttle Raf CAAX (CMV-Raf CAAX)) have been described (10Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). RCAS(A)-Raf BXB and RCAS(A)-Raf CAAXare replication-competent retroviruses containing the coding sequence for activated alleles of human Raf (10Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression plasmids encoding activated MEK1 (pBABE MEK E217/E221) or dominant inhibitory MEK1 (pBABE MEK-A221) were a generous gift from Dr. M. H. Cobb (University of Texas-Southwestern, Dallas, TX). myogeninpromoter deletions were constructed by PCR of genomic chick DNA. In brief, genomic DNA isolated from embryonic day-10 myocytes was amplified with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Loyola, CA), and the primers 5′-CGAGGTCGACGGTATCGATAAG (5′-primer) and 5′-GGGAGGACGTGTGCGCGGCTC (3′-primer), which span the region from 829 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site (+1) of themyogenin gene to the translational start site, respectively (22Malik S. Huang C.-F. Schmidt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The fidelity of the amplified DNA fragment (−829/+40) was confirmed by automated sequencing (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA). Themyogenin promoter fragment was inserted into the vector pGL2-basic (Promega, Madison, WI) to create −829mgn-Luc. 5′-deletion mutants of −829mgn-Luc were created by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase, the 3′-primer (see above), and the following 5′-primers: −829, 5′-CCCTCGAGGTCGACGGTATC; −668, 5′-CTCCGCTGGAATCTGGCCCAG; −545, 5′-GAAGGGTGAAAACCCATCCC; −470, 5′-GAACTGTTCCTCTCAGGGCTG; and −228, 5′-AGGGCAGCTCCCACCATGCC. An Xba restriction site was included at the beginning of the 5′-primer, and a BglII restriction site was included on the 3′-primer to allow for directional cloning into pGL2. The fidelity of the reporters was verified by automated DNA sequencing. Myoblasts were isolated from the hind limbs of embryonic day-10 (ED10) chicks (SPAFAS, Preston, CT) as described previously (10Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded onto gelatin-coated tissueware and cultured in growth media composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% chicken serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 20 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). 18 h post-plating, the myoblasts (2 × 105) were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitate formation with 0.5 μg of CMV-Raf BXB or CMV-Raf CAAX; 0.5 μg of CMV-LacZ or 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV; and 1.0 μg of −829mgn-Luc or an equimolar amount of the respectivemyogenin promoter deletion reporter plasmids. The cells were incubated with the DNA precipitates for 4 h followed by a brief osmotic shock (20% glycerol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). The cultures were maintained in growth media for an additional 48 h prior to lysis and measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase orRenilla luciferase activities. The luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase or Renilla to correct for transfection efficiencies. Statistical significance between the treatments was determined by analysis of variance. Chick ED10 myoblasts (1 × 106) were transduced with RCAS, RCAS-Raf CAAX, and RCAS-Raf BXB and treated for 48 h with 20 μm PD98059 (New England Biolabs, Beverly MA) or an equivalent amount of Me2SO. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 5 ml of RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). The lysates were processed according to the manufacturer's directions, and the total RNA pellet was dissolved in sterile water, quantified, and stored frozen at −80° C until needed. One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) in a reaction volume of 20 μl. Two microliters of the first strand reaction was amplified with Taq (Promega, Madison, WI) and the following primer sets: myogenin (F-GCAGCCTCAACCAGGAGGA, R-CTCCTCTGGGAACGTCACG) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (F-AGTCATCCCTGAGCTGAATG, R-AGGATCAAGTCCACAACACG). The amplification products were separated through ethidium bromide-containing agarose gels, visualized, and photographed. ED10 myoblasts were transduced with RCAS, RCAS-Raf CAAX, or RCAS-Raf BXB retroviruses as described previously (10Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For the inhibition of MEK activity, the cultures were incubated with growth media supplemented with 20 μmPD98059 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Extracts of nuclear proteins were prepared, and total protein content was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Ten micrograms of nuclear proteins were electrophoretically separated through 12% denaturing gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated for 60 min in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Subsequently, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-myogenin (1:3,000, a kind gift from Dr. Bruce Paterson, National Institutes of Health). The blots were washed extensively with TBST prior to incubation for 1 h with anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The blots were further washed with TBST, and the myogenin immunoreactive complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, AmershamBiosciences). Myoblasts (2 × 105) transiently transfected with 5 μg of pBABE MEK-E217/E221, pBABE MEK-A221, CMV-Raf BXB, or CMV-Raf CAAX were analyzed in a similar fashion. Briefly, the cells were lysed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer 3 days after transfection. Total cellular proteins were separated through 12% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed using anti-Myc (1:5,000; 9E10 ascites, Developmental Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) for the detection of Raf proteins and anti-MEK1 (1:500; C-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for the detection of MEK-A221 proteins. Visualization of immunocomplexes was achieved using the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence. Early work demonstrated that constitutive Ras activity leads to a loss of MRF expression in myocytes, which may contribute to the inhibitory effects of the kinase (21Lassar A.B. Thayer M.J. Overell R.W. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Because Raf signaling is a product of Ras action and Raf is an inhibitor of myogenesis, we examined the relative amounts of myogenin protein in Raf-transformed chick myoblasts (10Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, equal amounts of nuclear proteins were analyzed by Western blot using a polyclonal myogenin antibody. Chemiluminescent detection revealed equivalent amounts of myogenin in RCAS- and RCAS-Raf BXB-transduced myoblasts (Fig. 1 A). By contrast, the level of myogenin protein synthesized by RCAS-Raf CAAX-transformed myogenic cells was significantly reduced. To determine the effects of MEK inactivation on myogenin production, RCAS-, RCAS-Raf BXB-, and RCAS-Raf CAAX-transduced cells were treated with 20 μm PD98059 and analyzed by Western blot. PD98059 is a chemical agent with preferential specificity for MEK that acts to suppress activation of this kinase, leading to an inhibition of MAPK activity (23Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar, 24Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3924) Google Scholar, 25Wang X. Studzinski G.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 268: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Results demonstrate that the relative levels of myogenin protein synthesized by RCAS- and RCAS-Raf BXB-transduced myoblasts are unaffected by the MEK inhibitor. However, treatment of RCAS-Raf CAAX cells with the chemical agent restored myogenin protein expression. The re-establishment of myogenin expression is not a reflection of altered protein translation. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR for myogenin mRNA expression in the Raf-transformed cells is analogous to the Western blot findings. RCAS- and RCAS-Raf BXB-transduced cells transcribe abundant amounts ofmyogenin message, whereas RCAS-Raf CAAX-transduced myoblasts direct a fraction of the amount (Fig. 1 B). myogenin expression is affected by MEK activity, and re-establishment of gene expression to levels comparable with controls is achieved by inhibition of MEK. However, the restoration of myogenin does not remove the Raf-imposed block to myoblast differentiation (10Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To better understand the means by which MEK contributes to Raf-induced repression ofmyogenin, a panel of myogenin promoter deletions was constructed. The largest myogenin promoter fragment was amplified from chicken genomic DNA with primers designed from the published myogenin promoter sequence (22Malik S. Huang C.-F. Schmidt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The 829-bpmyogenin promoter region was analyzed by TFSEARCH, a web-based search engine for the identification of putativecis elements, and the results were used to develop the deletion mutants. As shown in Fig. 2, several DNA binding sites exist within the proximal promoter that are known to be affected by MAPK activity including Ras-response element-binding proteins, cAMP response element-binding proteins, E-boxes, and MEF2 binding sites (26Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar, 27Thiagalingam A. de Bustros A. Borges M. Jasti R. Diamond L. Mabry M. Ball D.W. Baylin S.B. Nelkin B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5335-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). ED10 chick myoblasts were transiently transfected with −829mgn-Luc, −668mgn-Luc, −545mgn-Luc, −470mgn-Luc, −228mgn-Luc, or pGL2-basic, CMV-β-galactosidase, and CMV or CMV-Raf CAAX. After 48 h the cells were lysed and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig.3, all of the myogeninpromoters are capable of supporting strong luciferase expression. The smallest promoter fragment, −228mgn-Luc, drives reporter gene expression to levels comparable with the largest myogeninpromoter reporter (−829mgn-Luc), indicating that all of the elements necessary for transcription are present in the proximal 228 base pairs. Additionally, constitutive expression of activated Raf dramatically inhibits each of the myogenin promoters to levels approximating 70% of control cells lacking Raf CAAXexpression. No differences were found between the various reporters with regard to the extent of inhibition. Therefore, the ciselements affected by Raf signaling likely are contained within the minimal promoter reporter, −228mgn-Luc.Figure 3Activated Raf inhibits myogeninpromoter reporter activity. Chick myoblasts (2 × 105) were transfected with 1 μg of −829mgn-Luc or an equimolar amount of 5′-deletion reporter, 0.5 μg of CMV-LacZ, 0.5 μg of CMV, or CMV-Raf CAAX. After 48 h cells were lysed, and luciferase and β-gal activities were measured. Normalized luciferase activity produced by pGL2 was set equal to one. Means and S.E. are from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the region of the myogenin promoter that responds to MEK signaling, the panel of myogenin promoter reporters was tested in Raf-expressing myoblasts treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Embryonic day-10 chick myoblasts were transiently transfected with equimolar amounts of −829mgn-Luc or −228mgn-Luc, pRL-renilla, and CMV or CMV-Raf CAAX. After 48 h, the cells were lysed, and luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were measured. As shown in Fig. 4 A, both the full-length (−829mgn-Luc) and minimal (−228mgn-Luc) promoter reporters efficiently activate luciferase expression in the absence of Raf signaling, and the levels of luciferase are reduced significantly in the presence of activated Raf. Moreover, treatment of Raf CAAX myoblasts with 20 μm PD98059 did not restore −829mgn-Luc or −228mgn-Luc transcriptional activities to levels comparable with those found in control myoblasts. Similar findings were found for the remaining deletion mutants (data not shown). Because the chemical inhibitor increases basalmyogenin promoter activity, ED10 myoblasts were transiently transfected with either the full-length reporter or the minimal promoter and expression plasmids encoding Raf CAAX and MEK-A221, a kinase-defective MEK. After 48 h the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured. The amount of luciferase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency by normalizing for β-galactosidase activity. Myoblasts expressing activated Raf directed low levels of −829mgn-Luc and −228mgn-Luc reporter activity as expected (Fig. 4 B). Cells cotransfected with CMV-Raf CAAX and pBABE-MEK-A221 failed to direct transcription from −829mgn-Luc to levels comparable with myoblasts transfected with reporter only. In an analogous fashion, the dominant inhibitory MEK-A221 protein was unable to restore full activity to the −228mgn-Luc reporter in the presence of activated Raf. The inability of the MEK inhibitors to restore myogeninpromoter function in the presence of Raf CAAX is not a product of insufficient MEK-A221 protein expression as determined by Western blot (Fig. 4 C). In brief, myoblasts were transfected with the expression plasmids coding for MEK-A221 and Raf CAAX. After 48 h, the cells were lysed with SDS-PAGE buffer, and equal amounts of protein were electrophoretically separated and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with anti-MEK1. Chemiluminescent detection revealed that abundant amounts of MEK-A221 were produced in the presence of Raf CAAX. Thus, reestablishment of myogenin gene expression by inhibition of MEK activity occurs independently of the cis-DNA elements located in the 829-bp promoter region. Recently it was reported that an inducible Raf BXB inhibits L6 myoblasts from terminal differentiation, and the block to myogenesis is a consequence of MEF2 localization to the cytoplasm (28Winter B. Arnold H.-H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Raf CAAX inhibits the minimalmyogenin promoter (−228mgn-Luc), and the region contains a single MEF2 DNA binding site (Fig. 2). To examine the effects of activated Raf on MEF2 and E-box function, each of the sites was mutated in the minimal promoter reporter to create −228mMEF2mgn-Luc and −228mEmgn-Luc, respectively. The promoter reporters were transfected into ED10 myoblasts with pRL-CMV, CMV, or CMV-Raf CAAX. After 48 h the cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were measured. As shown in Fig. 5, both the wild-type −228mgn-Luc and −228mEmgn-Luc direct abundant levels of luciferase activity in the absence of Raf signals. Mutation of the single MEF2 site within the context of the minimal promoter completely abolishes transcriptional activity as reported previously (22Malik S. Huang C.-F. Schmidt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of CMV-Raf CAAX significantly repressed activation of both wild-type and the E-box-deficient promoter reporters. Moreover, cotransfection of pMT2-MEF2A with −228mgn-Luc or −228mEmgn-Luc significantly enhanced the level of reporter activity compared with controls. Unexpectedly, cotransfection of the ED10 myoblasts with expression plasmids coding for Raf CAAX and MEF2A did not restore the levels of luciferase activity to levels comparable with control muscle cells transfected with −228mgn-Luc or −228mEmgn-Luc plus MEF2A. In addition, coexpression of activated Raf with MEF2 did not result in sequestration of the transcription factor in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6). These results are attributable to differences between primary avian muscle cells and C3H10T1/2 myoblasts as we were able to duplicate the results of Winter and Arnold (28Winter B. Arnold H.-H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were transfected with expression plasmids encoding avian MyoD (CMD), activated Raf, or MEF2A and −228mgn-Luc, −228mEmgn-Luc, or −228mMEF2mgn-Luc. After 48 h in differentiation-permissive media the cells were harvested, and reporter activities were measured. Activated Raf suppressed transcription from the wild-type reporter (Fig. 7). The transcriptional block was effectively removed by coexpression of MEF2 with Raf CAAX as reported previously (28Winter B. Arnold H.-H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, CMD was unable to activate transcription from −228mMEF2mgn-Luc, which contains a viable E-box. MEF2A readily activated −228mEmgn-Luc, and the levels of activity were enhanced significantly by coexpression with activated Raf. Thus, activated Raf inhibits avian myogenesis through a mechanism that is not entirely reflected in disrupted MEF2 function.Figure 6MEF2A localizes to the nucleus in the presence of Raf CAAX. Chick myoblasts were transiently transfected with pMT2-MEF2A (A) or pMT2-MEF2A and CMV-Raf CAAX (B). Cells were fixed and immunostained for MEF2A protein expression.

However, the mechanism by which chronic activity of the archetypical signaling module inhibits muscle gene expression is less well understood. Members of the myogenic regulatory factors retain inherent DNA binding and transcriptional activation capacities, thus suggesting that the molecular means for the repression of gene function is levied at alternate transcriptional mediators (4Kong Y.

Our study demonstrates that loss ofmyogenin gene expression accompanies elevated Raf kinase signaling in a MEK-dependent manner. Constitutive expression of Raf CAAX, a full-length membrane-localized Raf protein, dramatically reduces the number of myogenin mRNA transcripts and subsequent protein synthesis. Surprisingly, RCAS-Raf BXB-transduced myoblasts transcribe abundant amounts of myogenin mRNA, yet the cells remain differentiation-defective. Moreover, restoration of myogenin gene transcription by treatment of the RCAS-Raf CAAX myocytes with PD98059 does not reverse the negative effects of the kinase on morphological or biochemical differentiation. From these results, we conclude that loss of myogenin expression is not the molecular target of activated Raf that leads to repression of the muscle differentiation program. The predominant signaling cascade induced by Raf is the sequential activation of MEK and MAPK (1Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, Raf kinase interacts with additional kinase intermediates that may serve to amplify or instigate alternate, MEK-independent signaling (30Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40120-40127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 9: 174-179Google Scholar, 32Pearson G. Bumeister R. Henry D.O. Cobb M.H. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37303-37306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A direct physical association occurs between Raf and MEKK1, a dual-specific kinase that signals primarily through downstream Jun N-terminal kinase with minimal activation of MAPK (30Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40120-40127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Protein complexes comprised of MEKK1, MEK, and MAPK also can be found, suggesting that the kinase may serve as a scaffold protein for the Raf/MEK/MAPK module. Moreover, a mutated Raf protein that fails to interact with MEK and induce MAPK activity retains its ability to transactivate NFκB reporter genes, further supporting the growing body of evidence that Raf represents a signaling bifurcation point (32Pearson G. Bumeister R. Henry D.O. Cobb M.H. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37303-37306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our previous work indicates that the membrane-localized form of constitutively active Raf signals through downstream kinases that are MEK-independent (11Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27481-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report that MEK is present in embryonic chick myoblasts transduced with RCAS-Raf CAAX and that the chemical inhibitor PD98059 suppresses the functional activity of MEK in these cells. Thus, Raf CAAXdisrupts transcription from the myogenin gene in a MEK-dependent manner. We chose to look for MEK-responsivecis elements within the promoter of myogenin in an effort to identify targets of Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling that contribute to repression of myogenesis. Serial deletions of the largest promoter fragment did not reveal the presence of elements that are solely regulated by Raf/MEK actions. Interestingly, overexpression of a kinase-defective MEK (MEK-A221), disruption of the Raf/MEK interface (RKIP-N60), or treatment with PD98059 did not restore full transcriptional activity to −228mgn-Luc in the presence of Raf CAAX. These findings illustrate that the MEK-responsivecis element lies outside of the boundaries of themyogenin promoter regions examined. Recently, MEF2 was identified as a critical myogenic regulator whose function was disrupted as a consequence of activated Raf signaling (28Winter B. Arnold H.-H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L6 myoblasts overexpressing activated Raf fail to differentiate into mature myocytes partially because of the cytoplasmic localization of MEF2. Forced expression of MEF2 resulted in restoration of myoblast fusion and muscle gene transcription. In a similar manner, we found that activated Raf suppresses transcription from the minimalmyogenin promoter in C3H10T1/2 myoblasts, and the block to reporter gene activation is overcome by compulsory MEF2A expression. Thus, MEF2 likely is a target of Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling that lends to the inhibitory effects of the kinase in mouse myogenic cells. However, additional transcription factors also are altered in response to activated Raf signaling that contribute to the block to avian myogenesis. Embryonic chick myoblasts transfected with the minimal promoter (−228mgn-Luc) and expression plasmids coding for activated Raf and MEF2A did not direct reporter gene activity levels comparable with those found in avian myoblasts expressing MEF2 alone. Although MEF2 does partially restore transcription from the myogeninpromoter in the presence of Raf kinase, the levels fail to reach those directed by the synergistic actions of endogenous MRF and MEF2. Moreover, immunostaining for MEF2 failed to demonstrate a localization of the factor to the cytoplasm in the presence of constitutive Raf activity. These results argue that additional inhibitory mechanisms are initiated by activated Raf in avian myoblasts that contribute to the block to myocyte formation. The role of the MEK/MAPK signaling with regard to myogenic repression remains controversial. Recently, it was reported that a nuclear-localized, activated MEK can inhibit skeletal muscle gene transcription (33Perry R.L.S. Parker M.H. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 291-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, the repressive actions of MEK involved a physical association of the kinase with the transcriptional activation domain of MyoD and were independent of the basic helix-loop-helix and chromatin-remodeling domains of the MRF. A direct interaction of the MRFs and MEK may partially explain the repressive effects of Raf that are not attributable to disrupted MEF2 function. Under moderate levels of Raf activity (Raf BXB), myogenesis is inhibited by sequestration of MEF2 in the cytoplasm in a MAPK-dependent manner. Extreme levels of Raf activity (Raf CAAX) prevent muscle gene transcription by mechanisms that involve MAPK-mediated MEF2 translocation to the cytoplasm and MEK-MRF complex formation and repression. The validity of these inferences remains to be experimentally tested. We thank Dr. Bruce Paterson for provision of the anti-myogenin antibody."
