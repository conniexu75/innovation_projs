When [l-14C]ar- achidonate (20 PM, 0.4 PCi) was incubated with cultured human endothelial cells for 20 min, prostacyclin ap- peared in the supernatant along with small amounts of prostaglandins Fza and Ez. Pretreatment of the culture system with acetylsalicylic acid (100 PM) or 15-hydro- peroxyarachidonic acid abolished prostacyclin synthe- sis. Unlike the supernatants, the cells themselves did not contain measurable prostaglandins after arachi- donic acid incubation. Cell-associated radioactivity was only present in the phospholipid fraction and in a peak representing unconverted arachidonate. Omis- sion of cells from the culture system resulted in no conversion of arachidonic acid. Endothelial cell monolayers were pretreated with acetylsalicylic acid in order to block endogenous pros- taglandin synthesis and then incubated for 5 min with [1-‘4C]PGHz (2"

https://openalex.org/W1560365186,"Bacteriophage lambda int gene is required for the integration of viral DNA into the chromosome of Escherichia coli. We have extensively purified the product of the int gene (Int) from a lysogen of E. coli that constitutively expresses this gene. Int was assayed by its ability to promote integrative recombination of supertwisted substrate DNA in vitro using a new method based on filter trapping of a recombinant product DNA. In order to catalyze integrative recombination, Int must be supplemented by other factors that can be extracted from bacterial host cells. By itself, purified Int does not demonstrate detectable endonuclease, exonuclease, or nicking-closing activities. However, Int does make stable complexes with double-stranded lambda-DNA containing an attachment site, the region at which recombination takes place. No stable complexes are observed between Int and lambda-DNA without an attachment site or between Int and DNA containing the bacterial site of integration. Int, therefore, appears to be a specificity element that relies on additional factor(s) to provide or activate the catalytic functions required for recombination."

The sickling rates of cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum and of non-infected cells were studied both in the total absence of oxygen (by dithionite addition) and at several different concentrations of oxyhemoglobin which might obtain in vivo. In all cases, red cells containing small plasmodium parasite forms (ring forms) sickled approximately eight times as readily as uninfected cells. Cells containing large parasitic forms (trophozoites and schizonts) appeared to sickle less readily than uninfected cells, by light microscopy criteria, but electron micrographs demonstrated the presence of polymerized deoxyhemoglobin S with a high frequency. It is concluded that enhanced sickling of plasmodium-infected AS cells may be one mechanism whereby the hemoglobin S polymorphism is balanced in favor of the heterozygote."

https://openalex.org/W2137425708,"Evidence for phosphorylation of proteins by protein kinases has been found in Salmonella typhimurium despite previous indications that protein kinase action is absent in prokaryotes. At least four proteins have been found to be phosphorylated. Serine and threonine phosphates have been isolated from acid hydrolysates of these proteins after in vivo and in vitro labeling. The kinases do not phosphorylate histones, casein, or phosvitin. It would appear that phosphorylation as a regulatory control exists in prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1588154824,"Recent experiments have demonstrated that stimulation of rat hepatocyte alpha-adrenergic receptors alters the activity of enzymes known to be regulated by cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. These events apparently occur without an increase in the activity of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase. The present study compared the effects of glucagon and catecholamines on the incorporation of radioactive phosphate into cytosolic proteins obtained from intact rat hepatocytes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis resolved 27 phosphorylated bands in the molecular weight range 220,000 to 29,000. Treatment of the intact hepatocytes with glucagon or cyclic nucleotides increased the phosphorylation of 12 of these bands. Incubation of unlabeled cytoplasmic proteins with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP leads to the phosphorylation of 11 proteins. The molecular weights of these proteins were very similar to those altered by glucagon treatment of intact cells. Stimulation of the alpha-receptor with norepinephrine, epinephrine, or phenylephrine in the presence of 20 micrometer propranolol caused an increase in the phosphorylation of at least 10 of the same 12 phosphorylated bands stimulated by glucagon. The increase in phosphorylation mediated by alpha-receptors was only 50 to 60% of that observed with glucagon and occurred in the absence of any change in the level of adenosone 3':5'-monophosphate. The effects of alpha-receptor stimulation could be completely antagonized by 20 micrometer ergotamine or 20 micrometer phentolamine. Treatment of the cells with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 in an attempt to mimic alpha-receptor function increased the phosphorylation of 4 of the phosphoproteins altered by glucagon or catecholamines. The effects of the ionophore depended on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ ion and were similar in magnitude to those of catecholamines. It is concluded that alpha-receptor occupation alters the activity of an adenosin 3':5'-monophosphate-independent protein kinase or phosphatase with a specificity similar to those affected by cyclic nucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1566600363,"Temperature-sensitive conditional lethal mutants in phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (psd) accumulate large amounts of phosphatidylserine under nonpermissive conditions (42 degrees C) prior to cell death. In addition, the ratio of cardiolipin to phosphatidylglycerol is increased. At an intermediate temperature (37 degrees C), high levels of phosphatidylserine can be maintained with little effect on cell growth or viability. Under these conditions, both the rate of induction and the function of the lactose transport system are normal. At 42 degrees C addition of Mg2+ or Ca2+ to mutant cultures produces a partial phenotypic suppression. Growth is prolonged and the filaments normally present at 42 degrees C do not form. Upon transfer to the nonpermissive temperature, there is a considerable lag before accumulation of phosphatidylserine begins and the growth rate is affected. Based on the kinetics of heat inactivation of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity in extracts, in intact nongrowing cells, and in growing cells, it appears that the enzyme newly synthesized at 42 degrees C is more thermolabile in vivo than enzyme molecules previously inserted into the membrane at the lower temperature. Thus, the older, stable enzymatic activity must be diluted during growth before physiological effects are observed."

Two distinct lysine residues can be modified by the allosteric activator pyridoxal-P. Incorporation of [3H]pyridoxal-P in the presence of substrate ADP-glucose + MgCl2 prevents pyridoxylation of an ADP-glucose-protected site and allows modification of the allosteric activator site. Incorporation of [3H]pyridoxal-P in the presence of the allosteric effector, 1,6-hexanediol-P2, protects against pyridoxylation of the allosteric activator site and allows modification of the ADP-glucose-protected site. The activator site CNBr [3H]pyridoxyl-P peptide was purified to homogeneity in the presence of urea by Sephadex G-50 and CM-cellulose chromatography. The peptide consists of 59 residues, with a molecular weight of 6750. The NH2-terminal of the peptide has a 16-residue sequence overlap with the previously determined NH2-terminal sequence of the native enzyme. The activator site pyridoxyl-P lysine is identified as residue 38 of the native enzyme's NH2 terminus. The ADP-glucose-protected site CNBr [3H]pyridoxyl peptide was purified to homogeneity by Sephadex G-50 and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The peptide consists of 21 residues, with a molecular weight of 2460. The sequence of this peptide has been elucidated."

https://openalex.org/W2015938276,"Microtubule organization of mouse splenic lymphocytes was investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy using specific tubulin antibody. Each resting lymphocyte was shown to contain well organized microtubules which are associated with a microtubule organization center at one end. Microtubule organization of lymphocytes was readily modulated during patch and cap formation of surface immunoglobulins. These modulations induced by antibodies directed against immunoglobulins were prevented when the cells were incubated with 100 μg ml−1 of concanavalin A before the addition of antibodies. A modulation of microtubule organization was also detected when incubated in hypertonic medium where cap formation of various receptors was nonspecifically induced in the absence of ligand. The degree to which microtubule organization was modulated, however, was larger in cap formation induced with antibodies than in ligand-independent cap formation, probably because the latter does not require specific patch formation. On the cells forming cap in hypertonic medium, strong staining with tubulin antibody was observed beneath the cap, but the region of cap itself was not stained with tubulin antibody. A mitogenic dose of ConA did not readily induce any significant alteration of staining patterns with tubulin antibody but caused extreme changes in microtubule organization of lymphocytes after incubation for 48 hr. Growing lymphoma cells were shown to have poorly ordered microtubules and related structures. These results seem to suggest that the modulations of microtubule organization in lymphocytes are associated with cell surface events and cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W1498031307,"Incubation of 50 S subunits with 4.2 M LiCl leads to 4.2c cores and the complementary split protein fraction SP4.2, the latter containing quantitatively L24. L24 was removed from the split fraction by means of CM-cellulose chromatography. Partial and total reconstitution experiments performed with this protein preparation in the absence and presence of L24 demonstrate the crucial role of L24 in the early stage of assembly. However, this protein is dispensable for the subsequent steps of the in vitro assembly. 50 S subunits lacking L24 are fully active in the translation of artificial (poly(U)) and natural (R17 RNA) mRNA, indicating that L24 is not involved in any function of protein synthesis of the mature ribosome. It is therefore a mere assembly protein."

https://openalex.org/W1601466431,"Abstract The sugar phosphate:sugar transphosphorylation reaction catalyzed by the glucose Enzyme II complex of the phosphotransferase system has been analyzed kinetically. Initial rates of phosphoryl transfer from glucose-6-P to methyl alpha-glucopyranoside were determined with butanol/urea-extracted membranes from Salmonella typhimurium strains. The kinetic mechanism was shown to be Bi-Bi Sequential, indicating that the Enzyme II possesses nonoverlapping binding sites for sugar and sugar phosphate. Binding of the two substrates appears to occur in a positively cooperative fashion. A mutant with a defective glucose Enzyme II was isolated which transported methyl alpha-glucoside and glucose with reduced maximal velocities and higher Km values. In vitro kinetic studies of the transphosphorylation reaction catalyzed by the mutant enzyme showed a decrease in maximal velocity and increases in the Km values for both the sugar and sugar phosphate substrates. These results are consistent with the conclusion that a single Enzyme II complex catalyzes both transport and transphosphorylation of its sugar substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1516639593,"Conditions are reported under which membrane vesicles prepared from Escherichia coli K12 are depolarized by colicin Ia. Although incubation of membrane vesicles with active colicin Ia affects neither transport activity nor the ability of such vesicles to generate a deltapH or deltapsi, a single freeze-thaw cycle of such vesicles in the presence of colicin Ia leads to 1) retention of the colicin by the vesicles, 2) inactivation of transport activity, and 3) membrane depolarization, with a concomitant increase in the transmembrane deltapH. These effects are dependent upon the presence of active colicin Ia during the freeze-thaw cycle. These findings are consistent with our previous results showing that Ia-treated whole cells or membrane vesicles prepared from such cells are defective in their ability to generate a deltapsi, yet generate an increased deltapH (Tokuda, H., and Konisky, J. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 75, 2579--2583). In addition to its effect on vesicles prepared from sensitive cells, we show that vesicles prepared from both colicin Ia-resistant and -tolerant cells are depolarized by colicin treatment with a concomitant increase in deltapH. It is concluded that the final target of colicin Ia is the cytoplasmic membrane. A model for the mechanism of colicin Ia action is presented in which colicin Ia binds to the specific colicin Ia outer membrane receptor and is subsequently translocated to the cytoplasmic membrane where its integration leads to the formation of ion channels."

https://openalex.org/W2068325009,"PEPTIDYL-tRNA HYDROLASE (called hydrolase below) catalyses the hydrolysis of peptides from peptidyl-tRNAs that are not bound to ribosomes1,2 but will not hydrolyse amino acyl-tRNA or fMet-tRNAfMet. It is interesting that hydrolase seems to be ubiquitous in nature, it has been found in all cells where it has been sought, including yeast3, bacteria, rat liver and jackbeans4 However, the metabolic role of this enzyme has not been established It is required for normal function, as a mutant strain of Escherichia coli with a temperature-sensitive hydrolase cannot continue protein synthesis at the nonpermissive temperature5 Hydrolase itself is not required for initiation, elongation or termination phases of protein synthesis6 Menninger7 has shown that peptidyl-tRNA, formed on ribosomes, accumulates at nonpermissive temperatures in cells with the temperature-sensitive hydrolase. Hydrolase thus seems to be a scavenger enzyme of peptidyl-tRNAs normally aborted from ribosomes during protein synthesis Of interest now is why peptidyl-tRNA is frequently prematurely released from ribosomes and why protein synthesis is inhibited in the mutant strain with a defective hydrolase5 I report here work on the latter problem and present evidence which indicates that peptidyl-tRNAs accumulate and compete with N-formal-Met tRNAfMet during initiation of protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2084108341,"The lambda fus3 transducing phage carries several operons for ribosomal proteins of E. coli, including the str operon. A mutant transducing phage with a promoter mutation in this operon has been isolated. This mutant shows reduced stimulation of synthesis of proteins encoded by the operon, S12, S7, and elongation factors G and Tu, in ultraviolet-irradiated cells. This mutation also abolishes in vitro transcription from the str promoter. The DNA sequence of the mutant promoter shows that it is a point mutation 6 bases upstream from the in vitro transcription start site, changing the ""Pribnow box"" sequence from TAAAATT to TAAAACT. These results indicate that the site altered by the mutation, which is in the region just preceding the transcription start site, is important for the expression of the str operon."

https://openalex.org/W1483367004,"Previous communications from this laboratory have indicated that dicarboxylic acid transport in Escherichia coli is an active process, and that at least three genes are responsible for this transport system. In attempts to identify the transport components, one periplasmic binding protein and two membrane integral proteins (SBP 1 and SBP 2) were implicated to participate in the transport system in vivo. In the present communication, we demonstrate, through biochemical analysis of the transport mutants, that the two membrane transport genes, dctA and dctB, are responsible for the two membrane-bound dicarboxylate binding proteins, SBP 2 and SBP 1, respectively. We also find that the substrate recognition sites of SBP 1 and SBP 2 are exposed to the inner and outer surfaces of the membrane, respectively. This may have important implications for the role of SBP 1 and SBP 2 in the translocation process."
https://openalex.org/W1646649882,"In the course of our further investigation of the active site titration of carboxypeptidase Y, using 4-nitrophenyl trimethylacetate, we have found that carboxypeptidase Y can be isolated in different molecular forms. Carboxypeptidase Y obtained from Fleischmann baker's yeast has a molecular weight of 53,000, as compared to 64,000 for an enzyme species isolated from Anheuser-Busch baker's yeast. The amino acid analyses of both enzymes were essentially identical and very similar to those reported by others. However, we have found that the molecular weight difference is due to a variation in carbohydrate content as determined by gas chromatography. When carboxypeptidase Y was isolated from a single source, Anheuser-Busch baker's yeast, we observed a smaller variation in carbohydrate content. In all cases, sugar analyses revealed only mannose and N-acetylglucosamine to be present. The effect of the enzyme's carbohydrate content on the burst kinetics of the 4-nitrophenyl trimethylacetate reaction has been examined. In general, the Anheuser-Busch enzyme, containing more carbohydrate than the Fleischmann enzyme, reacts with a larger apparent bimolecular rate constant, kcat/Km. On the other hand, the deacylation rate constant, k3, is affected only slightly."

https://openalex.org/W1545159943,"Abstract A solid phase procedure has been developed for the rapid isolation of all 20 species of tRNA from Escherichia coli. The overall yields for a single preparation cycle ranged from 62 to 96%, the average being 80%. The values for the amino acid acceptor activities of the tRNA species equaled those reported in the literature for highly purified tRNAs. Starting from crude tRNA, a given tRNA species can easily be isolated in less than 2 h. One milliliter of the resin, which is reusable, is sufficient for the isolation of 200 mg of a specific tRNA. The procedure requires a bifunctional reagent, one moiety of which (--SO2Cl) reacts with the amino acid on the aminoacylated tRNA, the other, with the --SH group on the resin. Thus, only the desired tRNA species is bound to the resin; any of the other tRNAs in the filtrate can be isolated in another cycle. Raising the pH results in deacylation and release from the resin of the desired tRNA species. For tRNA Cys, it is necessary to block the --SH of cysteine prior to reaction with the bifunctional reagent. Side reactions involving the bifunctional reagent. Side reactions involving the bifunctional reagent and tRNA are either easily reversible or negligible (less than 0.01%)."
https://openalex.org/W1570782675,"2'-Deoxy-2'-azidocytidine-5'-triphosphate was investigated as an inhibitor in two reconstructed enzyme systems which catalyze the replication of two viral DNAs. During replication of the duplex replicative form of phiX174 DNA, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme was weakly inhibited and inhibition was reversed by dCTP. A more pronounced inhibition, not reversed by either dCTP or CTP, was observed during replication of the single-stranded DNA of the bacteriophage G4, a close relative of phiX174. This effect depended on the incorporation of 2'-deoxy-2'-azidocytidine-5'-triphosphate by primase (dnaG protein) which synthesizes a 29-residue RNA primer at the unique origin of bacteriophage G4 DNA replication. Extension of the primer strand, terminated by 2'-deoxy-2'-azidocytidine-5'-triphosphate is then severely inhibited. Primase was also inhibited by the 2'-deoxy-2'-azido derivatives of ATP, GTP, and UTP."

Although the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of certain diols as well as 1-amino-2-propanol, it is completely specific for the D-isomer of the amino alcohol and for NAD+. Two molecular forms (designated Form L and Form S) of the oxidoreductase, both of which are catalytically active, have been separated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200; apparently, Form L is converted to Form S by dissociation (Form L leads to Form S). Molecular weight determinations indicate that the two forms of the enzyme are different not only in size but also in shape; Form L apparently is an asymmetric tetramer of Form S. The two molecular species have similar catalytic properties. Both exhibit the same pH optimum of 8.6, have nearly identical apparent Km values for substrate and cosubstrate, are equally sensitive to inhibition by p-mercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide, and show the same specificity for cosubstrate. Neither form of the enzyme has an absolute requirement for added thiol compounds or divalent metal ions."
https://openalex.org/W1489368545,"Bacteriophage T4 carrying an amber mutation in gene 22 plus an amber mutation in gene 21 form aberrant, tubular structures termed rough polyheads, instead of complete phage when they infect Escherichia coli B. These rough polyheads consist almost entirely of the major capsid protein in its uncleaved form (gp23). When rough polyheads are treated under mild conditions with any of the five proteases, trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, pronase, or the protease from Staphylococcus aureus V8, the gp23 is rapidly hydrolyzed at a limited number of peptide bonds. In contrast, cleaved capsid protein (gp23) in mature phage capsids is completely resistant to proteolysis under the same conditions. A major project in this laboratory requires determining the primary structure of gp23, a large protein (Mr = 58,000) quite rich in those amino acids at which cleavages are achieved by conventional means. Recovery of peptides from the complex mixtures resulting from such cleavages proved to be extremely difficult. The limited proteolysis of gp23 in rough polyheads had yielded a set of large, easily purified fragments which are greatly simplifying the task of determining the primary structure of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W105530787,"Recent work from several laboratories has established the following points about the synthesis of the polypeptide chain elongation factors Tu and G in Escherichia coli. (i) Elongation factor Tu is the product of duplicate, highly conserved genes, tufA and tufB, which are widely separate parts of the chromosome. (ii) The molar concentration of this factor is considerably higher than that of elongation factor G which is encoded by the fus gene. (iii) Although the tufA and fus genes are close together and can be co-transcribed in the direction from fus to tufA, the tufA gene product is synthesized at several times the rate of the fus gene product. In an attempt to understand what mechanism(s) could account for the differential expression of the tufA and fus genes, we sought to obtain more precise information on the physical relationship of these genes. By examining heteroduplexes between restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of DNA containing the tufA, fus, and tufB genes, we have demonstrated that the fus and tufA genes are intimately related physically in one of two possible arrangements. Either the NH2-terminal region of the tufA gene is contiguous with the COOH-terminal region of the fus gene or the beginning of the tufA gene overlaps part of the fus gene. These results mean that if the tufA gene is always co-transcribed with the fus gene, then some mechanism must allow the tufA portion of the transcript to be translated more often than the fus gene portion of the transcript."
