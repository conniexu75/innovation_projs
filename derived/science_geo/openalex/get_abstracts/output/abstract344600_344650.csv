https://openalex.org/W2017847424,"It has been brought to our attention that wedid not designate the correct collectors of severalof the samples reported in Lamont radiocarbonmeasurements III [ Science 124, 154 (27 July1956)]. The following list gives the proper collectors for several samples in Table 4 under V. Arcticstudies : L192B, R. D. Cotell (1952); L261A,B,C,G. Hattersley-Smith (1953); L254A, L248A, R. L.Christie (1954); L254B,C,D, E. W. Marshall(1954); and L248B, G. Hattersley-Smith and A.P. Crary (1954)."
https://openalex.org/W1973491279,"The evidence presented here indicates that man lived in the eastern part of the Beringian refugium before the peak of the late Wisconsin glaciation (27). He had sharp, stone tools intended for working bone and means of breaking large mammoth bones. Probably he hunted mammoth and caribou, and prepared the skins of the caribou for use as clothing and perhaps shelter. It is possible that he migrated to southern North America, although evidence for the presence of man there prior to the peak of the Wisconsin glaciation is at present in dispute (28). We do not know whether his culture should be classified as Mousteroid or Aurignacoid in MÃ¼ller-Beck's scheme (23), whose criteria are taken from stone implements of which we have none, although we infer their presence. Our data suggest that in Beringia, and therefore probably in Siberia and the Far East, the transition from Middle Paleolithic to Upper Paleolithic levels of technology occurred at a relatively early date. This raises the larger question: Did the transition from Middle to Upper Paleolithic occur simultaneously in many parts of the world, or did it begin in and spread from one area (23)?"

https://openalex.org/W2055517081,"In connection with the current national campaign against narcotics, there has been some propaganda to declare illegal the peyote used by many Indian tribes. We are professional anthropologists who have made extensive studies of Peyotism in various tribes. We have participated in the rites and partaken of the sacramental peyote. We therefore feel it our duty to protest against a campaign which only reveals the ignorance of the propagandists concerned."

https://openalex.org/W2083571701,"Samuel A. Bowring and Todd Housh (1) report Sm/Nd isotopic data giving a wide range of initial ENd values, from +3.5 to -4 at 4.0 billion years ago (Ga) and from +4 to -7 at 3.6 Ga. Their samples were from the Acasta gneisses of northern Canada, which represent the oldest known outcrops of continental crust (2). Their modeling of the Sm-Nd isotopic data is taken to suggest that the Acasta granitoid rocks were formed from mixtures between mantle-derived melts and crustal melts derived from extremely ancient (about 4.3 Ga), heterogeneous, depleted (high Sm/Nd) and enriched (low Sm/Nd) reservoirs. We consider it likely that the wide range of initial ENd values has a much simpler explanation. We plot the Acasta gneiss Sm-Nd data of Bowring and Housh (1) and Bowring et al. (3) on a Sm-Nd isochron diagram (Fig."
