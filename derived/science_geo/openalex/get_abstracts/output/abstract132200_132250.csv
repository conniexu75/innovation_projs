https://openalex.org/W2129114331,"Although cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are thought to be involved in the control of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) infection, it has not been possible to demonstrate a direct relation between CTL activity and plasma RNA viral load. Human leukocyte antigen-peptide tetrameric complexes offer a specific means to directly quantitate circulating CTLs ex vivo. With the use of the tetrameric complexes, a significant inverse correlation was observed between HIV-specific CTL frequency and plasma RNA viral load. In contrast, no significant association was detected between the clearance rate of productively infected cells and frequency of HIV-specific CTLs. These data are consistent with a significant role for HIV-specific CTLs in the control of HIV infection and suggest a considerable cytopathic effect of the virus in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2103549209,"The vagaries of history lead to the prediction that repeated instances of evolutionary diversification will lead to disparate outcomes even if starting conditions are similar. We tested this proposition by examining the evolutionary radiation of Anolis lizards on the four islands of the Greater Antilles. Morphometric analyses indicate that the same set of habitat specialists, termed ecomorphs, occurs on all four islands. Although these similar assemblages could result from a single evolutionary origin of each ecomorph, followed by dispersal or vicariance, phylogenetic analysis indicates that the ecomorphs originated independently on each island. Thus, adaptive radiation in similar environments can overcome historical contingencies to produce strikingly similar evolutionary outcomes."

Recently, however, ecologists and economists have begun to develop more systematic approaches. Here, the problem of efficiently allocating scarce conservation resources in the selection of sites for biological reserves is addressed. With the use of county-level data on land prices and the incidence of endangered species, it is shown that accounting for heterogeneity in land prices results in a substantial increase in efficiency in terms of either the cost of achieving a fixed coverage of species or the coverage attained from a fixed budget."

https://openalex.org/W2045639174,"Crystal structures of the murine cytokine-inducible nitric oxide synthase oxygenase dimer with active-center water molecules, the substrate L-arginine (L-Arg), or product analog thiocitrulline reveal how dimerization, cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, and L-Arg binding complete the catalytic center for synthesis of the essential biological signal and cytotoxin nitric oxide. Pterin binding refolds the central interface region, recruits new structural elements, creates a 30 angstrom deep active-center channel, and causes a 35 degrees helical tilt to expose a heme edge and the adjacent residue tryptophan-366 for likely reductase domain interactions and caveolin inhibition. Heme propionate interactions with pterin and L-Arg suggest that pterin has electronic influences on heme-bound oxygen. L-Arginine binds to glutamic acid-371 and stacks with heme in an otherwise hydrophobic pocket to aid activation of heme-bound oxygen by direct proton donation and thereby differentiate the two chemical steps of nitric oxide synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2001159755,"The infrared spectrum of single oxygen carbon sulfide (OCS) molecules was measured inside large superfluid pure helium-4 droplets and nonsuperfluid pure helium-3 droplets, both consisting of about 10 4 atoms. In the helium-4 droplets, sharp rotational lines were observed, whereas in helium-3 only a broad peak was found. This difference is interpreted as evidence that the narrow rotational lines, which imply free rotations, are a microscopic manifestation of superfluidity. Upon addition of 60 helium-4 atoms to the pure helium-3 droplets, the same sharp rotational lines were found; it appears that 60 is the minimum number needed for superfluidity."

https://openalex.org/W1975196303,"When contacts are first forming in the developing nervous system, many neurons generate spontaneous activity that has been hypothesized to shape appropriately patterned connections. In Mustela putorius furo, monocular intraocular blockade of spontaneous retinal waves of action potentials by cholinergic agents altered the subsequent eye-specific lamination pattern of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The projection from the active retina was greatly expanded into territory normally belonging to the other eye, and the projection from the inactive retina was substantially reduced. Thus, interocular competition driven by endogenous retinal activity determines the pattern of eye-specific connections from retina to LGN, demonstrating that spontaneous activity can produce highly stereotyped patterns of connections before the onset of visual experience."

https://openalex.org/W1971689738,"Liquid crystals (LCs) were used to amplify and transduce receptor-mediated binding of proteins at surfaces into optical outputs. Spontaneously organized surfaces were designed so that protein molecules, upon binding to ligands hosted on these surfaces, triggered changes in the orientations of 1- to 20-micrometer-thick films of supported LCs, thus corresponding to a reorientation of ∼10 5 to 10 6 mesogens per protein. Binding-induced changes in the intensity of light transmitted through the LC were easily seen with the naked eye and could be further amplified by using surfaces designed so that protein-ligand recognition causes twisted nematic LCs to untwist. This approach to the detection of ligand-receptor binding does not require labeling of the analyte, does not require the use of electroanalytical apparatus, provides a spatial resolution of micrometers, and is sufficiently simple that it may find use in biochemical assays and imaging of spatially resolved chemical libraries."
https://openalex.org/W2138711194,"The efficient representation of all species in conservation planning is problematic. Often, species distribution is assessed by dividing the land into a grid; complementary sets of grids, in which each taxon is represented at least once, are then sought. To determine if this approach provides useful surrogate information, species and higher taxon data for South African plants and animals were analyzed. Complementary species sets did not coincide and overlapped little with higher taxon sets. Survey extent and taxonomic knowledge did not affect this overlap. Thus, the assumptions of surrogacy, on which so much conservation planning is based, are not supported."
https://openalex.org/W2030315855,"The physical and chemical mechanism of ore precipitation in the Yankee Lode tin deposit (Mole Granite, Australia) was quantified by direct trace-element microanalysis of fluid inclusions. Laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was used to measure element concentrations in a series of fluid inclusions representing the fluid before, during, and after the deposition of cassiterite (SnO 2 ). Tin precipitation was driven by mixing of hot magmatic brine with cooler meteoric water. At the same time, a separate magmatic vapor phase selectively transported copper and boron into the liquid mixture."

In the perfused heart, ischemia/reperfusion activates SR-MAPKs. Although the agent(s) directly responsible is unclear, reactive oxygen species are generated during ischemia/reperfusion. We have assessed the ability of oxidative stress (as exemplified by H2O2) to activate SR-MAPKs in the perfused heart and compared it with the effect of ischemia/reperfusion. H2O2 activated both SAPKs/JNKs and p38-MAPK. Maximal activation by H2O2 in both cases was observed at 0.5 mm. Whereas activation of p38-MAPK by H2O2 was comparable to that of ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion, activation of the SAPKs/JNKs was less than that of ischemia/reperfusion. As with ischemia/reperfusion, there was minimal activation of the ERK MAPK subfamily by H2O2. MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2), a downstream substrate of p38-MAPKs, was activated by H2O2 to a similar extent as with ischemia or ischemia/reperfusion. In all instances, activation of MAPKAPK2 in perfused hearts was inhibited by SB203580, an inhibitor of p38-MAPKs. Perfusion of hearts at high aortic pressure (20 kilopascals) also activated the SR-MAPKs and MAPKAPK2. Free radical trapping agents (dimethyl sulfoxide and N-t-butyl-α-phenyl nitrone) inhibited the activation of SR-MAPKs and MAPKAPK2 by ischemia/reperfusion.

We are interested in signals that may potentially activate the SR-MAPKs in ischemic/reperfusion stress. During ischemia and on reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium, there is release of ROS as well as other factors (reviewed in Refs. 1Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A. Annu. Rev.

Here, we have examined the potential of oxidative stress (as exemplified by perfusion with H2O2) to activate SR-MAPKs and MAPKAPK2 in the isolated rat heart and have compared the effects of H2O2 with those of ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion. Using antioxidants, we investigated the role of ROS in the activation of SR-MAPKs in ischemia/reperfusion. In addition, we have examined the effects of another pathophysiologically important stress (hypertensive stress) on activation of the SR-MAPKs.

Antibodies to JNK1, JNK2, and p38-MAPK were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The JNK1 antibody (sc-474) was a rabbit antibody raised to a C-terminal region of human JNK1 (amino acids 368–384). Antibodies to JNK2 (sc-572 and sc-827) were raised to the full-length 424-residue protein and amino acids 5–22 from human JNK2, respectively. The p38-MAPK antibody (sc-535) was a rabbit antibody raised to amino acids 341–360 at the C terminus of the mouse sequence. The N-terminaltrans-activation domain of human c-Jun (amino acid residues 1–135) and the catalytic domain of murine MAPKAPK2 (amino acid residues 46–400) were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and were purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) chromatography (38Smith S.B.

Adult male (250–300 g) Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were perfused retrogradely at a pressure of 10 kilopascals (70 mm Hg) with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate-buffered saline (25 mm NaHCO3, 119 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.6)) at 37 °C supplemented with 10 mm glucose and equilibrated with 95% O2/5% CO2. The temperature of the perfusates and hearts was maintained at 37 °C by the use of a water-jacketed apparatus. Coronary flows were determined at 10 min after cannulation and were also measured during and at the end of the experiments. All other times given refer to times following the appropriate equilibration period. For experiments in which H2O2 was the only agent added, hearts were perfused for a 15-min equilibration period. H2O2 was added to the requisite concentration, and hearts were perfused for a further 5–30 min. For hearts subjected solely to simple global ischemia or to ischemia/reperfusion, the equilibration period was 15 min. The perfusion was then interrupted for 20 min by clamping the aortic perfusion line. Hearts ceased beating within 1 min of ischemia. Where indicated, ischemic hearts were reperfused for 10 min by reopening the aortic perfusion line. Hearts resumed beating within 1 min of reperfusion, and coronary flow returned to within 80% of control values (control, 13 ml/min/heart; reperfused, 11 ml/min/heart). Control hearts were perfused for up to 30 min after the pre-equilibration period without interruption to the perfusate flow. For hearts subjected to increased aortic pressure, the perfusion pressure was raised to 20 kilopascals (140 mm Hg) after the 15-min equilibration period, and the perfusions were continued for 20 min. When Me2SO, SB203580 (10 mm stock in Me2SO), or BPN (2.5 m stock in Me2SO) was used, the hearts were perfused for 15 min. Me2SO, SB203580/Me2SO, or BPN/Me2SO was then added, and the perfusions were continued for another 15 min before the addition of H2O2 or the imposition of ischemia. At the end of all perfusions, hearts were “freeze-clamped” between aluminum tongs cooled in liquid N2 and pulverized under liquid N2, and the powders were stored at −80 °C. Heart powders were homogenized with 3 volumes of immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 50 mmNaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 20 mm n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The samples were extracted on ice (10 min) and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The supernatants (150 μl) were incubated with 4 μl (0.4 μg) JNK1 antibody or 8 μl (0.8 μg) p38-MAPK antibody on a rotating wheel (2 h, 4 °C). Protein A-Sepharose was added (20 μl of a 50% slurry in immunoprecipitation buffer), and the samples were rotated for a further 1 h. The samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 1 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were removed and boiled with 0.33 volume of SDS sample buffer (0.33 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% (w/v) SDS, 13% (v/v) glycerol, 133 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bromphenol blue). The pellet was washed in immunoprecipitation buffer (3 × 150 μl, 4 °C), resuspended in 150 μl, and boiled with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples (30 μl) were assayed for JNK1 or p38-MAPK activity by the in gel kinase method. MAPKs in immunoprecipitates prepared from heart extracts (see previous section) or in whole heart extracts were assayed by the in gel kinase method (41Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). For analysis of whole heart extracts, heart powders were homogenized with 3 volumes of buffer A (20 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.5), 50 mmNaF, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm benzamidine, 200 μm leupeptin, 10 μm trans-epoxy succinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 300 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) and extracted on ice (5 min). The samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were boiled with 0.33 volume of SDS sample buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217317) Google Scholar). Proteins (for whole heart extract, 100 μg loaded/lane) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels that had been formed in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP) for the assay of ERKs, 0.5 mg/ml GST-c-Jun(1–135) for the assay of SAPKs/JNKs, or 0.5 mg/ml GST-MAPKAPK2(46–400) for the assay of p38-MAPKs, with a 6% (w/v) stacking gel. Following electrophoresis, SDS was removed from the gels by washing in 20% (v/v) propan-2-ol in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) (3 × 20 min). The propan-2-ol was removed by washing in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (3 × 20 min). Proteins were denatured in 6 mguanidine-HCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol (2 × 30 min) and then renatured in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.04% (v/v) Tween 40 (1 × 30 min, 2 × 1 h, 1 × 18 h, 1 × 30 min, 4 °C). The gels were equilibrated to room temperature with 40 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2(2 × 30 min) and incubated for 3 h with 12.5 μCi/gel [γ-32P]ATP in 5 ml of 40 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 0.1 μm PKI. The reaction was stopped, and gels were washed with 1% (w/v) disodium pyrophosphate, 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The gels were dried onto 3MM Whatman chromatography paper and autoradiographed. In gel kinase activities were quantified by laser scanning densitometry. Proteins (30 μl) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose (42Bogoyevitch M.A. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder in 20 mm NaH2PO4, 80 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mmNaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (pH 7.5) (PBST) for 30 min, and the blots were incubated with JNK1 or p38-MAPK antibodies (1:100 dilution in blocking solution, overnight, 4 °C). After washing in PBST (3 × 5 min), the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:5000 dilution in PBST containing 1% (w/v) nonfat milk powder, 1 h, room temperature). The blots were washed again in PBST (3 × 5 min), and the bands were detected using ECL with exposure to Hyperfilm MP. Blots were quantified by laser scanning densitometry. Supernatants of heart powders homogenized with 3 volumes of buffer A were diluted 4-fold with buffer A and recentrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Proteins in samples (0.5 ml) were separated by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). ERKs were separated on a Mono Q HR5/5 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.3), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (v/v) Brij-35, 0.3 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm benzamidine, and 4 μg/ml leupeptin. Following a 5-ml isocratic wash, ERKs were separated using a linear NaCl gradient (20 ml, 0–0.33 m NaCl) at flow rate of 1 ml/min with collection of 0.5-ml fractions. They were assayed by the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into MBP by the direct method as described previously (43Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Samples of fractions were also taken for in gel kinase assays and were boiled with 0.33 volume of SDS sample buffer. For MAPKAPK2, heart extracts were applied to a Mono S HR5/5 column equilibrated with 25 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 2 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. Following a 5-ml isocratic wash, MAPKAPK2 was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (15 ml, 0–0.3 m NaCl) at flow rate of 1 ml/min with collection of 1-ml fractions. MAPKAPK2 was assayed by the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into KKLNRTLSVA peptide substrate (37Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) as described previously (32Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J. Ketterman A.J. Fuller S.J. Ben-Levy R. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 161-172Crossref Scopus (491) Google Scholar), except that the incubation time was decreased to 10 min. For the determination of total MAPKAPK2 activity, the areas under the FPLC peaks were integrated. In gel kinase assays of hearts perfused for 30 min showed maximal activation of both p46 and p54 SAPKs/JNKs with 0.5 mm H2O2 (Fig. 1 A). Activation was reduced at higher concentrations. This activation was never as great as that observed after ischemia (20 min) followed by reperfusion (10 min) (Fig. 1 A). We also confirmed that ischemia alone (20 min) did not activate the SAPKs/JNKs (Fig. 1 A). JNK1 antibodies immunoprecipitated all of the p46 SAPK/JNK activity (Fig. 1 B, top panel) and protein (Fig. 1 B,bottom panel), and approximately 25% of the p54 SAPK/JNK activity (Fig. 1 B, top panel). It is not possible to determine the proportion of p54 SAPK/JNK protein immunoprecipitated by the JNK1 antibody (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel) because of the interference by immunoglobulins in this region of the gel. These data confirm that the activities principally responsible for phosphorylation of c-Jun(1–135) in the in gel kinase assays (Fig. 1 A) were SAPKs/JNKs. Analogous experiments showed that p38-MAPK was also maximally activated by perfusion with 0.5 mm H2O2 for 30 min (Fig. 2 A). In this case, activation was comparable with that induced by ischemia (20 min) alone or ischemia (20 min) followed by reperfusion (10 min) (Fig. 2 A). In gel phosphorylation of GST-MAPKAPK2(46–400) was essentially completely inhibited by 10 μm SB203580 confirming that the activity responsible was p38-MAPK (Fig. 2 B). p38-MAPK antibodies immunoprecipitated only approximately 50% of the p38-MAPK activity (Fig. 2 C,top panel) and p38-MAPK protein detected on immunoblots (Fig. 2 C, bottom panel). This proportion was not altered by increasing the p38-MAPK antibody concentration (results not shown), demonstrating that the incomplete immunoprecipitation did not result from insufficient antibody. Furthermore, the apparent molecular mass of the immunoprecipitated p38-MAPK activity (Fig. 2 C,top panel) and protein (Fig. 2 C, bottom panel) was slightly greater than that remaining in the supernatant, indicating that more than one isoform of p38-MAPK may be activated in perfused rat heart. It is apparent that although this antibody will detect more than one denatured form of p38-MAPK (Fig. 2 C, bottom panel), not all native forms are recognized (Fig. 2 C, top panel). Activation of MAPKs by 0.5 mmH2O2 was mainly confined to the stress-regulated forms. In gel kinase assays showed minimal phosphorylation of the ERK substrate, MBP, by extracts of hearts perfused with H2O2 for 30 min (results not shown). However, because ERKs are generally activated at earlier times than the SR-MAPKs in heart (29Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Andersson M.B. Clerk A. Lazou A. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. J.

As a positive control, the effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, which powerfully activates ERKs in hearts (29Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Andersson M.B. Clerk A. Lazou A. Marshall C.J.

Res. 1994; 75: 932-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and were activated in hearts perfused with PMA (1 μm, 5 min) (Fig. 3, A and B). Relatively little activation of p42 and p44 ERKs (ERK2 and ERK1 respectively) was observed after perfusion with H2O2 (Fig. 3, A and B). The identities of the kinases detected after FPLC were confirmed as p42 and p44 ERKs by in gel kinase assays with MBP as substrate (Fig. 3 B). MAPKAPK2 is an established substrate of p38-MAPK (18Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). The activation of MAPKAPK2 was studied following FPLC on Mono S columns. Ischemia (Fig. 4 A), ischemia/reperfusion (Fig. 4 B), and H2O2 (Fig. 4 C) all induced activation of MAPKAPK2. The effects of ischemia and H2O2 were comparable, but the effects of ischemia/reperfusion were consistently greater. SB203580 is a selective inhibitor for p38-MAPK and inclusion of 10 μmSB203580 (in Me2SO, 0.1% (v/v), 14 mm final concentration) in the perfusion media abolished the activation of MAPKAPK2 by all of these interventions (Fig. 4, A–C). To ensure that these effects were independent of Me2SO, 14 mm Me2SO was included in all perfusions. Independently, we showed that inclusion of this concentration of M"

Important pathologic properties of this protein, such as neurotoxicity and resistance to proteolytic degradation, depend on the ability of Aβ to form β-sheet structures or amyloid fibrils. We report that melatonin, a hormone recently found to protect neurons against Aβ toxicity, interacts with Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 and inhibits the progressive formation of β-sheets and amyloid fibrils. These interactions between melatonin and the amyloid peptides were demonstrated by circular dichroism and electron microscopy for Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 and by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for Aβ1–40. Inhibition of β-sheets and fibrils could not be accomplished in control experiments when a free radical scavenger or a melatonin analog were substituted for melatonin under otherwise identical conditions. In sharp contrast with conventional anti-oxidants and available anti-amyloidogenic compounds, melatonin crosses the blood-brain barrier, is relatively devoid of toxicity, and constitutes a potential new therapeutic agent in Alzheimer's disease.

Synthetic peptides homologous to Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, however, undergo spontaneous rearrangements of their initial secondary structure, generating oligomeric and polymeric species with higher content of β-sheets (9Barrow C.J.

First, it has been demonstrated that the amyloid peptide is neurotoxic (23Yankner D.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar, 24Behl C.

A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Second, the ability of Aβ to form fibrils is directly correlated with the content of β-sheet structures adopted by the peptide (32Soto C. Castaño E.M. Kumar R.A. Beavis R.C. Frangione B. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this regard, it has been proposed that peptides with high contents of β-sheets can act as seeds for nucleation and fibril formation (33Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 34Snyder S.W. Ladror U.S. Wade W.S. Wang G.T. Barrett G.T. Biophys J. 1994; 67: 1216-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Finally, Aβ peptides with high contents of β-sheets become partially resistant to proteolytic degradation, and this may be a crucial mechanism in amyloid deposition (35Soto C. Castaño E.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Such protease resistance and insolubility features, shared by all known forms of amyloidoses, prevent amyloid removal from tissue deposits. Thus, by preventing the formation of β-sheets one could not only reduce neurotoxicity but also facilitate clearance of Aβ via increased proteolytic degradation. It has recently been found that melatonin has cytoprotective properties against Aβ toxicity (36Pappolla M.A. Sos M. Omar A.R. Bick R.J. Hickson-Bick D.L.M. et al.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the process of investigating the mechanisms of action of melatonin, new properties of this hormone were uncovered. As determined by CD, electron microscopy, and 1H NMR, melatonin interacted with Aβ and had a profound inhibitory effect on the formation of β-sheets and fibrils. Most interestingly, the observed changes in Aβ conformation appear to depend on specific structural characteristics of the hormone rather than on its recently established antioxidant properties (37Reiter R.J. Poeggeler B. Tan D.-X. Chen L.-D. Manchester L.C. Neuroendocr. Lett. 1993; 15: 103-116Google Scholar). Peptides Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were synthesized in the W. M. Keck Foundation (Yale University, CT), and their purity was evaluated by amino acid sequence and laser desorption mass spectrometry as described (32Soto C. Castaño E.M. Kumar R.A. Beavis R.C. Frangione B. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Aliquots of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 at a concentration of 250 μm in 5 mm Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, were incubated at room temperature alone or with 100 μm of either melatonin or the melatonin analog 5-hydroxy-N-acetyl-tryptamine (NAT) (Sigma) or N-t-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) (Sigma), a powerful free radical scavenger structurally unrelated to melatonin. Because of the antioxidant properties of melatonin (37Reiter R.J. Poeggeler B. Tan D.-X. Chen L.-D. Manchester L.C. Neuroendocr. Lett. 1993; 15: 103-116Google Scholar) and because oxidative conditions may promote fibril formation (34Snyder S.W. Ladror U.S. Wade W.S. Wang G.T. Barrett G.T.

Spectra in the far ultraviolet light (190–250 nm) were recorded at various time intervals with a Jasco-720 spectropolarimeter as described (32Soto C. Castaño E.M. Kumar R.A. Beavis R.C. Frangione B. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) using a cell path of 0.01 cm. Experiments with Aβ1–42 necessitated shorter incubation times due to the more fibrillogenic properties and faster aggregation exhibited by the longer peptide. 40 scans/experimental condition were obtained at 0.2 nm intervals over the wavelength range 190–250 nm. The data were analyzed by the Lincomb algorythm (39Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) to obtain the percentages of the different secondary structures motifs. To determine whether melatonin displayed inhibitory effects on amyloid fibril formation, transmission electron microscopy was performed following a standard method previously described (40Pappolla M.A. Alzofon J. McMahon J. Theodoropoulos T.J. Eur. Arch. Psych. Neurol. Sci. 1990; 239: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) using a Phillips CM100 microscope and Formvar-coated nickel grids. Aβ1–40 was incubated at the same concentrations as noted for the CD and NMR experiments in the presence or absence of melatonin, and fibril formation was monitored at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h in three independent experiments. Additional controls containing Aβ plus NAT and Aβ plus PBN were incubated in parallel for 48 h. To determine the minimal inhibitory concentration of melatonin on fibril formation, we performed experiments in which several melatonin concentrations (1 nm, 10 nm, 1 μm, 10 μm, 100 μm, and 200 μm) were added to tubes containing 250 μm Aβ1–40, incubated for 48 h, and then examined. For the more amyloidogenic Aβ1–42, experiments were preformed at the same peptide concentration (250 μm) in the presence or absence of melatonin at various concentrations (100 nm, 1 μm, 10 μm, 100 μm, and 200 μm). The formation of amyloid fibrils was monitored at 0, 2, and 6 h. To further explore structural changes of Aβ by melatonin we performed one-dimensional1H NMR spectroscopic studies on Aβ1–40. The NMR approach has the distinct advantage of being able to specifically locate the amino acid side chains that bind to a particular ligand (41Wemmer D.E. Williams P.G. James T.L. Oppenheimer N.J. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. 239. Academic Press, New York1994: 739-767Google Scholar). The solution conditions for the NMR and CD studies were similar, except that deuterated water (D20) in phosphate buffer was used in the NMR study. All 1H NMR spectra were obtained at 600 MHz using a Varian UnityPlus-600 spectrometer, and the data were processed using the FELIX program (version 95.0, Biosym, Inc.). The NMR solutions were prepared in D20 (0.6 ml) with sodium phosphate buffer (5 mm, pH 7.5), perdeuterated Na2EDTA (0.5 mm), NaN3 (0.05 mm), and 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 (0.05 mm), the last of which serves as an internal chemical shift reference at 0 ppm. The NMR measurements were performed at 10 °C and the residual protium absorption of D20 was suppressed by low power irradiation during the recycle delay. For all spectra, 128 scans were required with a total recycle delay of 4.2 s, which included an acquisition time and recycle delay of 2.2 and 2.0 s, respectively. The digital resolution of the acquired data was 0.24 Hz/pt, which was reduced to 0.12 Hz/pt by zero-filling the data once before processing. To further improve the resolution, before Fourier transformation spectra were multiplied by a Lorentzian-to-Gaussian weighting factor. This experiment was duplicated on two different days. As expected, the content in β-sheet conformation of Aβ1–40 incubated alone increased over time from 52% at time 0 to 66% after 24 h at 37 °C (Fig. 1 A). These results are in qualitative agreement with previous work (42Terzi E. Holzemann G. Seelig J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The relative proportion of the structures was dramatically changed by addition of melatonin to sister tubes. At time 0, there was an immediate increase of the random conformation, whereas the original β-sheet content markedly diminished (Fig. 1 A, left panel). This effect was not observed with NAT or PBN. The amount of β-sheet structures for Aβ1–40 plus melatonin decreased over time, reaching 24% after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 1 A, right panel). At 24 h, no structural changes were again detected in control experiments with the melatonin analog NAT, and only small effects were observed with PBN. Experiments with the more amyloidogenic Aβ1–42 showed qualitatively similar results (Fig. 1 B). Melatonin caused an immediate reduction in the amount of β-sheet structures at time 0 from 89 to 65% (Fig. 1 B, left panel). This percentage continued to decrease to 59% after 4 h of incubation (Fig. 1 B, right panel). As observed with Aβ1–40, such striking structural changes were not elicited in parallel control preparations containing Aβ1–42 plus NAT or PBN. Results of the ultrastructural studies reflected the conformational changes and supported the hypothesis that formation of β-sheet structures precede fibrillogenesis (32Soto C. Castaño E.M. Kumar R.A. Beavis R.C. Frangione B. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 33Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). In three independent experiments, fibrils were abundant in the tubes containing Aβ1–40 alone incubated for 36 h. In contrast, no fibrils were detected for solutions of Aβ1–40 plus melatonin up to 48 h (Fig. 2). Notably, fibrils were abundant and easily identifiable in the tubes incubated for 48 h containing Aβ alone, Aβ plus NAT, or Aβ plus PBN but not in the tubes containing Aβ plus melatonin. Such a contrasting finding suggests that the methoxy group at position 5 of the indolamine nucleus of melatonin confers relative structural specificity to the observed phenomena. Fibril formation was inhibited in all tubes containing Aβ1–40 plus melatonin at concentrations above 10 μm. To substantiate the negative results obtained with PBN, three different concentrations of this scavenger (10, 100, and 200 μm) were added to tubes containing Aβ1–40, incubated for 48 h, and then examined. Fibrils were abundant in all these tubes. In contrast, only amorphous material was again identified in control sister tubes containing 250 μm Aβ1–40 plus 100 μm melatonin. In the experiments with Aβ1–42, fibrils were identified in the tubes containing the peptide alone incubated after 2 and 6 h (no fibrils were seen at time 0). In contrast, only amorphous material was identified in the tubes containing Aβ1–42 plus melatonin at these time points (Fig. 3). All the concentrations of melatonin used in the experiments with AB1–42 (see “Materials and Methods”) were effective to inhibit fibril formation. Shown in Fig. 4 are the downfield spectral regions for the Aβ1–40 peptide, melatonin (Fig. 4 E) and the Aβ1–40 with 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 molar equivalents of melatonin (Fig. 4,B–D). The three well resolved His-2H and His-4H signals are consistent with the Aβ1–40 peptide being partly folded into an ordered structure, which according to the CD studies should be β-sheet and random coil. If only random coil structure were present, then degenerate signals should be present for His6, His13, and His14 (43Zagorski M.G. Barrow C.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5621-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The NMR spectra of the mixtures of melatonin and Aβ1–40 show changes in chemical shifts indicative of binding and local conformational changes. The His-2H and His-4H signals shift downfield 0.05 and 0.02 ppm, respectively, whereas the aromatic peaks of melatonin also shift downfield (Fig. 4). In addition, careful analysis of the upfield spectral region (spectra not shown) revealed downfield shifts for the Asp βCH2 groups (Table I). Control NMR experiments with NAT showed only minor chemical shift perturbations (± 0.01 ppm), suggesting a specificity for the interaction of melatonin with Aβ. The lack of any line broadening or separate peaks for the bound and free states indicates that the binding is in the fast exchange limit (41Wemmer D.E. Williams P.G. James T.L. Oppenheimer N.J. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. 239. Academic Press, New York1994: 739-767Google Scholar). The downfield shifts can be interpreted in terms of ring-current shift contributions, with the shifted hydrogens becoming located in the planes of the melatonin and His aromatic ring (44Perkins S.J. Berlier L.J. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Plenum Press, New York1982Google Scholar). A remarkable feature is the identical shift seen for each of the three His residues. This result together with the observed non-linearity of the shifts with varied melatonin concentrations suggests that the binding is not localized to a particular His site on Aβ. Instead, the chemical shift changes are consistent with a residue-specific interaction between melatonin and any of the three His and Asp residues of Aβ.Table ITitration studies of Aβ(1–40) peptide with melatoninChemical shiftBound chemical shift1-2001Obtained by subtracting the chemical shift of melatonin and the Aβ(1–40) peptide with the present data, we are unable to assign the 2H and 4H signals specifically to His6, His13, and His14.cpmMelatonin1-bAssignments for 5 mm melatonin. 2H7.150.09 4H7.150.09 6H6.890.03 7H7.380.05 1′-CH22.920.04 2′-CH23.480.01 CH3-N-acetyl1.91−0.01 CH3-methoxyl3.870.03Aβ (1–40)1-2003Because the βCH2s for Asp1, Asp7, and Asp23 are not resolvable by 1H NMR, chemical shift ranges are presented.

Open table in a new tab Melatonin has a proposed role in the aging process (45Pierpaoli W. Dall'Ara A. Pedrinis E. Regelson W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 621: 291-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 46Pierpaoli W. Aging (Milano). 1991; 3: 99-101PubMed Google Scholar). Decreased secretion of this hormone during aging is well documented (47Iguchi H. Kato K. Ibayashi H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metabol. 1982; 55: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 48Dori D. Casale G. Solerte S.B. Fioravanti M. et al.Chronobiology. 1994; 21: 121-126PubMed Google Scholar), and more profound reductions are reported in populations with dementia (49Souetre E. Salvati E. Krebs B. Belugou J.L. Darcourt G. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1989; 146: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 50Mishima K. Okawa M. Hishikawa Y. Hozumi S. et al.Acta Psychiatr. Scand. 1994; 89: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The reported lack of toxicity of melatonin and the ease and rapidity with which this molecule crosses the blood-brain barrier following oral administration (51Tan D.X. Chen L.-D. Poeggeler B. Manchester L.C. Reiter R.J. Endocrinol. J. 1993; 1: 57-60Google Scholar) makes it a prime candidate for experimental testing in humans. This hormone has been administered to human subjects at very high doses (i.e. 1 g/day) without any clinically significant toxicity (52Nordlund J.J. Lerner A.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1977; 45: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our data clearly indicate that under the conditions tested, melatonin modifies the secondary structure of the Aβ peptide and inhibits the formation of amyloid fibrils. These newly found anti-amyloidogenic properties of melatonin are very rare for endogenous substances. Because of the relationship between oxidative stress and AD and the recently established antioxidant properties of this hormone, it was initially thought that the neuroprotective actions of melatonin were mostly due to its intracellular antioxidant effects (36Pappolla M.A. Sos M. Omar A.R. Bick R.J. Hickson-Bick D.L.M. et al.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the results presented here suggest that the anti-amyloidogenic properties are dependant on structural interactions of the hormone with Aβ rather than on antioxidant properties exclusively. The His and Asp residues play important roles in β-amyloid fibril production and stability. Many physiological constituents such as transthyretin and zinc can prevent or promote aggregation by their affinities for the His residues of Aβ (53Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Paradis M.D. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12152-12158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Schwarzman A.L. Gregori L. Vitek M.P. Lyubski S. Strittmatter W.J. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8368-8372Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Additionally, imidazole-carboxylate salt bridges between the side chains of the His+ and the Asp− residues are critical to the formation of the amyloid β-sheet structures (12Kirchner D.A. Inouye H. Duffy L.K. Sinclair A. Lind M. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6953-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar,55Fraser P.E. McLachlan D.R. Surewicz W.K. Mizzen C.A.

Biol. 1997; 269: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). More significantly, disruption of these salt bridges promotes fibril dissolution (58Lee J.P. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.R. Mantyh P.W. Lu Y.-A. et al.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). One possibility is that melatonin promotes the β-sheet → random coil conversion by disruption of the His+-Asp− salt bridges. Alternatively, the described effects may result from a unique combination of structural and antioxidant features of this molecule. More experiments are necessary to clarify this interpretation and dissect the relationship between cytoprotection, changes in peptide structure, and antioxidant characteristics. The antioxidant properties of melatonin may provide additional cytoprotection at the intracellular level (36Pappolla M.A. Sos M. Omar A.R. Bick R.J. Hickson-Bick D.L.M. et al.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio melatonin:Aβ used in these studies is within physiologic range, because the concentration of both substances in the brain are normally around 1:1 during youth (both substances are at comparable picomolar concentrations in brain tissue during the dark phase of the cycle (59Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Motter R. Hu K. Gordon G. Barbour R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 60Pang S.F. Ralph C.L. Reilley P. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1974; 22: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). However, limitations of the methods employed required concentrations of melatonin and Aβ that deviate from actual physiological conditions. At this time, no information is available about the possible therapeutic or preventive values of melatonin or of its potential efficacy at physiologic or pharmacologic dosages. It would be premature to conclude that a subgroup of AD is caused by an age-related deficiency of this hormone, although such a possibility is nonetheless intriguing. The results reported here suggest that melatonin can provide a combination of antioxidant and anti-amyloidogenic features that can be explored either as a preventive or therapeutic treatment for AD or as a model for development of anti-amyloidogenic indole analogs.

Natural forms of the C-X-C chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (GCP-2) and the C-C chemokine regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), which miss two NH2-terminal residues, including a Pro in the penultimate position, have been isolated from leukocytes or tumor cells. In chemotaxis and intracellular calcium mobilization assays, the truncation caused a reduction in the specific activity of RANTES but not of GCP-2. The serine protease CD26/dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (CD26/DPP IV) could induce this observed NH2-terminal truncation of GCP-2 and RANTES but not that of the monocyte chemotactic proteins MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3. No significant difference in neutrophil activation was detected between intact and CD26/DPP IV-truncated GCP-2. In contrast to intact natural RANTES(1–68), which still chemoattracts monocytes at 10 ng/ml, CD26/DPP IV-truncated RANTES(3–68) was inactive at 300 ng/ml and behaved as a natural chemotaxis inhibitor. Compared with intact RANTES, only a 10-fold higher concentration of RANTES(3–68) induced a significant Ca2+ response. Furthermore, RANTES(3–68) inhibited infection of mononuclear cells by an M-tropic HIV-1 strain 5-fold more efficiently than intact RANTES. Thus, proteolytic processing of RANTES by CD26/DPP IV may constitute an important regulatory mechanism during anti-inflammatory and antiviral responses.

Thus, proteolytic processing of RANTES by CD26/DPP IV may constitute an important regulatory mechanism during anti-inflammatory and antiviral responses. Chemokines constitute a family of small proinflammatory cytokines with leukocyte chemotactic and activating properties. Depending on the position of the first two Cys, the chemokine family can be divided in C-C, C-X-C, C, and C-X3-C chemokines (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev.

NH2-terminal processing can either activate chemokines or render chemokines completely inactive. The C-X-C chemokine platelet basic protein becomes a natural neutrophil chemotactic peptide (neutrophil activating peptide-2) only after the enzymatic removal of 24 NH2-terminal residues (4Walz A. Baggiolini M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Van Damme J. Rampart M. Conings R. Decock B. Van Osselaer N. Willems J. Billiau A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2113-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of up to eight NH2-terminal residues from IL-8 results in an enhanced chemotactic activity, but further deletion of the Glu-Leu-Arg motif, which is located in front of the first Cys in all neutrophil chemotactic C-X-C chemokines, causes complete inactivation (6Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar NH2-terminal proteolysis (up to eight amino acids) of another C-X-C chemokine, granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (GCP-2), has no effect on its neutrophil chemotactic activity (7Proost P. Wuyts A. Conings R. Lenaerts J.-P. Billiau A. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10170-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the NH2 terminus has been reported to be essential for MCPs to retain their biological activity. The synthetical C-C chemokines MCP-1, MCP-3, and RANTES missing the eight or nine NH2-terminal amino acids are inactive on monocytes and are useful as receptor inhibitors (8Gong J.-H. Uguccioni M.

Extension of RANTES with one methionine results in complete inactivation of the molecule, and Met-RANTES behaves as an inhibitor for authentic RANTES (10Proudfoot A.E. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J.

The exopeptidase DPP IV is present as a membrane-associated ectoenzyme on lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells and occurs in soluble form in body fluids, such as plasma, urine, and seminal fluid (11Fleischer B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the hematopoietic system, DPP IV was identified as the activation antigen CD26. A subpopulation of memory (CD45RO+) T cells with a high surface density of CD26 is responsible for the proliferation in response to recall antigenin vitro (12Vanham G. Kestens L. De Meester I. Vingerhoets J. Penne G. Vanhoof G. Scharpé S. Heyligen H. Bosmans E. Ceuppens J.L. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1993; 6: 749-757PubMed Google Scholar). CD26/DPP IV is a highly specific aminopeptidase, cleaving off dipeptides from the NH2terminus of peptides with a Pro, Hyp, or Ala at the penultimate position (11Fleischer B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A number of cytokines, and among these, several chemokines, share an Xaa-Pro sequence at their NH2 terminus (13Vanhoof G. Goossens F. De Meester I. Hendriks D. Scharpé S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal Xaa-Pro may not only contribute to the receptor binding and/or signaling function, but may also serve as a structural protection against nonspecific proteolytic degradation. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of CD26/DPP IV has been reported to suppress T cell proliferation in vitro (14Schön E. Jahn S. Kiessig S.T. Demuth H.U. Neubert K. Barth A. Von Baehr R.

However, the natural substrates targeted by CD26/DPP IV in the immune system are unknown.Recently, a role for both CD26/DPP IV and C-C chemokines,i.e. RANTES and the macrophage inflammatory proteins MIP-1α and MIP-1β, has been postulated during HIV-1 infection with macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strains (17Oravecz T.

During the purification of GCP-2 and RANTES from natural sources, we detected significant quantities (more than 50% of the chemokine content) of NH2-terminally truncated variants missing the first two amino acids (Gly-Pro and Ser-Pro for GCP-2 and RANTES, respectively). We tested whether the exopeptidase CD26/DPP IV was able to process these and other chemokines with a penultimate Pro at their NH2 terminus and whether this cleavage resulted in an altered biological activity. Although the occurrence of the NH2-terminal Xaa-Pro motif as a target for CD26/DPP IV was observed several years ago, the failure of processing mature IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, and other cytokines by CD26/DPP IV indicated that peptides become less susceptible to cleavage by CD26/DPP IV with increasing length (11Fleischer B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29Hoffmann T. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Indeed, the largest peptide (44 amino acids) reported to be sensitive to NH2-terminal truncation by CD26/DPP IV is growth hormone-releasing hormone (30Frohman L.A. Downs T. Heimer E. Felix A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1533-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).In this study, two chemokines of about 70 residues with Pro at the penultimate NH2-terminal position, i.e. the C-X-C chemokine GCP-2 and the C-C chemokine RANTES, were processed by CD26/DPP IV, but the C-C chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3 were resistant to degradation by the enzyme. Earlier observations that naturally truncated froms of MCP-1, MCP-2, or MCP-3, missing two NH2-terminal amino acids, were not isolated from various cellular sources (22Proost P. Wuyts A. Conings R. Lenaerts J.-P. Put W. Van Damme J. Methods: Companion Methods in Enzymol. 1996; 10: 82-92Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) confirm the specificity of CD26/DPP IV. Resistance of MCP-2 to CD26/DPP IV is a consequence of the presence of the NH2-terminal pyroglutamic acid, because recombinant MCP-2 with an NH2-terminal Gln was cleaved by CD26/DPP IV (data not shown). The importance of the NH2-terminal residues has been illustrated by chemical synthesis of truncated MCP-1 and MCP-3, which are devoid of monocyte chemotactic activity (8Gong J.-H. Uguccioni M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10521-10527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Gong J.H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Truncation of GCP-2 with CD26/DPP IV had no significant effect on the chemotactic and Ca2+-releasing capacity of the chemokine. In contrast, a 10–100-fold decreased monocyte chemotactic and intracellular Ca2+-releasing activity was detected with RANTES(3–68) processed by CD26/DPP IV. However, RANTES and RANTES(3–68) were reported to be equipotent eosinophil chemotactic proteins (31Noso N. Sticherling M. Bartels J. Mallet A.I. Christophers E. Schröder J.-M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1946-1953PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of different RANTES receptors,i.e. CCR3 on eosinophils compared with CCR1 and CCR5 on mononuclear cells (3Taub D.D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 335-376Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Murphy P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), may explain the different interaction of RANTES(3–68) with both cell types. In addition to monocytes, also memory type CD45RO+ T cells, which express CCR1, CCR5, and CD26, are important target cells for RANTES (32Wu B.L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. Ruffing N. Rottman J.B.

Nature. 1990; 347: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). In view of these observations, a physical proximity between RANTES and CD26/DPP IV seems feasible, and therefore, the processing of RANTES by CD26/DPP IV is likely to be of biological significance.When tested as a RANTES inhibitor, 1 μg/ml of inactive RANTES(3–68) was able to inhibit monocyte chemotaxis toward 100 ng/ml and 300 ng/ml of intact RANTES. In Ca2+ mobilization experiments, 300 ng/ml of RANTES(3–68) only partially desensitized for a response toward intact RANTES. These results suggest that RANTES(3–68) binds to at least one receptor and that the interaction of RANTES(3–68) with the receptor(s) is sufficient for partial signal transduction (increase of the [Ca2+]i) but not for chemotaxis.Recently, chemokines, their receptors, and CD26/DPP IV have been linked to HIV-1-infection. Concerning the role of CD26/DPP IV in HIV-infection, contrasting reports have been published. A positive correlation between the level of CD26/DPP IV-expression and the susceptibility to infection with M-tropic HIV-1 viruses was found (17Oravecz T. Roderiquez G. Koffi J. Wang J. Ditto M. Bou-Habib D.C. Lusso P. Norcross M.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), whereas this correlation could not be detected for T-tropic viruses (34Morimoto C. Lord C.I. Zhang C. Duke-Cohan J.S. Letvin N.L. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9960-9964Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, CD26/DPP IV was described as a cofactor for HIV entry in CD4+ cells (35Callebaut C. Krust B. Jacotot E. Hovanessian A.G. Science. 1993; 262: 2045-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In contrast, CD26/DPP IV+cells were found to be less susceptible to HIV infection than CD26/DPP IV− cells (34Morimoto C. Lord C.I. Zhang C. Duke-Cohan J.S. Letvin N.L. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9960-9964Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A specific decrease in CD26/DPP IV-expression was reported upon HIV-1 infection of cells with M-tropic, but not T-tropic viruses (17Oravecz T. Roderiquez G. Koffi J. Wang J. Ditto M. Bou-Habib D.C. Lusso P. Norcross M.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and both the absolute number and the proportion of CD26+ T cells were decreased in HIV-infected persons (12Vanham G. Kestens L. De Meester I. Vingerhoets J. Penne G. Vanhoof G. Scharpé S. Heyligen H. Bosmans E. Ceuppens J.L. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1993; 6: 749-757PubMed Google Scholar).Several chemokines, including RANTES, were identified as inhibitors of HIV-1 infection (18Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Arya S.K. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Science. 1995; 270: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). The use of CCR5 as a coreceptor by M-tropic viruses explains the inhibitory effect of the C-C chemokines RANTES, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β on HIV-1 infection (19Murphy P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 20Premack B.A. Schall T.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 21D'Souza M.P. Harden V.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1293-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Co-expression of CD26/DPP IV and CCR5 (32Wu B.L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. Ruffing N. Rottman J.B. Sullivan N. Choe H. Sodroski J. Newman W. Koup R.A. MacKay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) could therefore explain the specific decrease of CD26+CD4+ cells during HIV infection. Recent reports on chemically synthesized RANTES(9–68), missing six extra NH2-terminal residues compared with RANTES(3–68), have shown a reduction of the anti-HIV activity of RANTES (36Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Rousset D. Clark-Lewis I. Loetscher P. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Nature. 1996; 383: 400Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). RANTES(9–68) also functioned as a chemokine inhibitor, but about 10-fold higher amounts, compared with intact RANTES, were necessary to obtain a comparable anti-HIV-1 activity. NH2-terminally altered amino-oxypentane-RANTES also acts as a chemotaxis inhibitor and, in contrast to RANTES(9–68), was more efficient as an inhibitor of HIV-1 infection than intact RANTES (37Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Picard L. Offord R.E. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Buser R. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Science. 1997; 276: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Thus, minor modifications of RANTES at the NH2 terminus are detrimental to its chemotactic activity and alter its anti-HIV activity. Compared with intact RANTES, RANTES(3–68), generated by CD26/DPP IV cleavage, is a more efficient inhibitor of HIV-1 infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with M-tropic strains. At the same time, RANTES(3–68), which is a much weaker chemotaxis agonist compared with intact RANTES, can provide negative feedback to weaken the inflammatory response. Although it is at present impossible to discriminate between RANTES(1–68) and RANTES(3–68) in clinical samples, studies on the in vivo balance between both RANTES forms may provide interesting information on the (patho-)physiological role of RANTES(3–68).In conclusion, we have isolated naturally occurring forms of the chemokines GCP-2 and RANTES, missing their NH2-terminal Xaa-Pro motif. We demonstrated that CD26/DPP IV is able to cleave chemokines in vitro into these NH2-terminally truncated forms. Although truncated and intact GCP-2 are equally active, RANTES(3–68) becomes a natural chemotaxis inhibitor and is a more potent inhibitor of HIV-1-infection than intact RANTES. RANTES is the first cytokine reported, of which the biological activity can be modified by CD26/DPP IV. This finding may lead to novel insights on the role of this specific peptidase not only in HIV-infection but also in inflammatory processes and immune responses. Chemokines constitute a family of small proinflammatory cytokines with leukocyte chemotactic and activating properties. Depending on the position of the first two Cys, the chemokine family can be divided in C-C, C-X-C, C, and C-X3-C chemokines (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Google Scholar, 2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar, 3Taub D.D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 335-376Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Many C-X-C chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+ concentration; CCR, C-C chemokine receptor; CD26/DPP IV, dipeptidyl-peptidase IV; GCP-2, granulocyte chemotactic protein-2; MCP, monocyte chemotactic protein; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted. 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+ concentration; CCR, C-C chemokine receptor; CD26/DPP IV, dipeptidyl-peptidase IV; GCP-2, granulocyte chemotactic protein-2; MCP, monocyte chemotactic protein; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted. are chemotactic for neutrophils, whereas C-C chemokines, such as monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3), are active on a variety of leukocytes, including monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. The NH2-terminal domain of chemokines is involved in receptor binding. NH2-terminal processing can either activate chemokines or render chemokines completely inactive. The C-X-C chemokine platelet basic protein becomes a natural neutrophil chemotactic peptide (neutrophil activating peptide-2) only after the enzymatic removal of 24 NH2-terminal residues (4Walz A. Baggiolini M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 5Van Damme J. Rampart M. Conings R. Decock B. Van Osselaer N. Willems J. Billiau A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2113-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of up to eight NH2-terminal residues from IL-8 results in an enhanced chemotactic activity, but further deletion of the Glu-Leu-Arg motif, which is located in front of the first Cys in all neutrophil chemotactic C-X-C chemokines, causes complete inactivation (6Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar NH2-terminal proteolysis (up to eight amino acids) of another C-X-C chemokine, granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (GCP-2), has no effect on its neutrophil chemotactic activity (7Proost P. Wuyts A. Conings R. Lenaerts J.-P. Billiau A. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10170-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the NH2 terminus has been reported to be essential for MCPs to retain their biological activity. The synthetical C-C chemokines MCP-1, MCP-3, and RANTES missing the eight or nine NH2-terminal amino acids are inactive on monocytes and are useful as receptor inhibitors (8Gong J.-H. Uguccioni M.

Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Extension of RANTES with one methionine results in complete inactivation of the molecule, and Met-RANTES behaves as an inhibitor for authentic RANTES (10Proudfoot A.E. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J.

In this report, we describe the physiological occurrence of natural forms of human GCP-2 and RANTES missing the first two amino acids, and we give direct evidence that dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP IV; EC3.4.14.5) is capable of cleaving these chemokines at their NH2 terminus. The exopeptidase DPP IV is present as a membrane-associated ectoenzyme on lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells and occurs in soluble form in body fluids, such as plasma, urine, and seminal fluid (11Fleischer B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the hematopoietic system, DPP IV was identified as the activation antigen CD26. A subpopulation of memory (CD45RO+) T cells with a high surface density of CD26 is responsible for the proliferation in response to recall antigenin vitro (12Vanham G. Kestens L. De Meester I. Vingerhoets J. Penne G. Vanhoof G. Scharpé S. Heyligen H. Bosmans E. Ceuppens J.L. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1993; 6: 749-757PubMed Google Scholar). CD26/DPP IV is a highly specific aminopeptidase, cleaving off dipeptides from the NH2terminus of peptides with a Pro, Hyp, or Ala at the penultimate position (11Fleischer B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A number of cytokines, and among these, several chemokines, share an Xaa-Pro sequence at their NH2 terminus (13Vanhoof G. Goossens F. De Meester I. Hendriks D. Scharpé S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal Xaa-Pro may not only contribute to the receptor binding and/or signaling function, but may also serve as a structural protection against nonspecific proteolytic degradation. Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of CD26/DPP IV has been reported to suppress T cell proliferation in vitro (14Schön E. Jahn S. Kiessig S.T. Demuth H.U. Neubert K. Barth A. Von Baehr R. Ansorge S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), to decrease antibody production in mice (15Kubota T. Flentke G.R. Bachovchin W.W. Stollar B.D. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 89: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and to prolong cardiac allograft survival in rat recipients (16Korom S. De Meester I. Stadlbauer T.H.W. Chandraker A. Schaub M. Sayegh M.H. Belyaev A. Haemers A. Scharpé S. KupiecWeglinski J.W. Transplantation. 1997; 63: 1495-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the natural substrates targeted by CD26/DPP IV in the immune system are unknown. Recently, a role for both CD26/DPP IV and C-C chemokines,i.e. RANTES and the macrophage inflammatory proteins MIP-1α and MIP-1β, has been postulated during HIV-1 infection with macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strains (17Oravecz T.

Nature. 1990; 347: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). In view of these observations, a physical proximity between RANTES and CD26/DPP IV seems feasible, and therefore, the processing of RANTES by CD26/DPP IV is likely to be of biological significance.When tested as a RANTES inhibitor, 1 μg/ml of inactive RANTES(3–68) was able to inhibit monocyte chemotaxis toward 100 ng/ml and 300 ng/ml of intact RANTES. In Ca2+ mobilization experiments, 300 ng/ml of RANTES(3–68) only partially desensitized for a response toward intact RANTES. These results suggest that RANTES(3–68) binds to at least one receptor and that the interaction of RANTES(3–68) with the receptor(s) is sufficient for partial signal transduction (increase of the [Ca2+]i) but not for chemotaxis.Recently, chemokines, their receptors, and CD26/DPP IV have been linked to HIV-1-infection. Concerning the role of CD26/DPP IV in HIV-infection, contrasting reports have been published. A positive correlation between the level of CD26/DPP IV-expression and the susceptibility to infection with M-tropic HIV-1 viruses was found (17Oravecz T. Roderiquez G. Koffi J. Wang J. Ditto M. Bou-Habib D.C. Lusso P. Norcross M.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), whereas this correlation could not be detected for T-tropic viruses (34Morimoto C. Lord C.I. Zhang C. Duke-Cohan J.S. Letvin N.L. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9960-9964Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, CD26/DPP IV was described as a cofactor for HIV entry in CD4+ cells (35Callebaut C. Krust B. Jacotot E. Hovanessian A.G. Science. 1993; 262: 2045-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In contrast, CD26/DPP IV+cells were found to be less susceptible to HIV infection than CD26/DPP IV− cells (34Morimoto C. Lord C.I. Zhang C. Duke-Cohan J.S. Letvin N.L. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9960-9964Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A specific decrease in CD26/DPP IV-expression was reported upon HIV-1 infection of cells with M-tropic, but not T-tropic viruses (17Oravecz T. Roderiquez G. Koffi J. Wang J. Ditto M. Bou-Habib D.C. Lusso P. Norcross M.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and both the absolute number and the proportion of CD26+ T cells were decreased in HIV-infected persons (12Vanham G. Kestens L. De Meester I. Vingerhoets J. Penne G. Vanhoof G. Scharpé S. Heyligen H. Bosmans E. Ceuppens J.L. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1993; 6: 749-757PubMed Google Scholar).Several chemokines, including RANTES, were identified as inhibitors of HIV-1 infection (18Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Arya S.K. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Science. 1995; 270: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). The use of CCR5 as a coreceptor by M-tropic viruses explains the inhibitory effect of the C-C chemokines RANTES, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β on HIV-1 infection (19Murphy P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 20Premack B.A. Schall T.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 21D'Souza M.P. Harden V.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1293-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Co-expression of CD26/DPP IV and CCR5 (32Wu B.L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. Ruffing N. Rottman J.B. Sullivan N. Choe H. Sodroski J. Newman W. Koup R.A. MacKay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) could therefore explain the specific decrease of CD26+CD4+ cells during HIV infection. Recent reports on chemically synthesized RANTES(9–68), missing six extra NH2-terminal residues compared with RANTES(3–68), have shown a reduction of the anti-HIV activity of RANTES (36Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Rousset D. Clark-Lewis I. Loetscher P. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Nature. 1996; 383: 400Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). RANTES(9–68) also functioned as a chemokine inhibitor, but about 10-fold higher amounts, compared with intact RANTES, were necessary to obtain a comparable anti-HIV-1 activity. NH2-terminally altered amino-oxypentane-RANTES also acts as a chemotaxis inhibitor and, in contrast to RANTES(9–68), was more efficient as an inhibitor of HIV-1 infection than intact RANTES (37Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Picard L. Offord R.E. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Buser R. Wells T.N.C. Proudfoot A.E.I. Science. 1997; 276: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Thus, minor modifications of RANTES at the NH2 terminus are detrimental to its chemotactic activity and alter its anti-HIV activity. Compared with intact RANTES, RANTES(3–68), generated by CD26/DPP IV cleavage, is a more efficient inhibitor of HIV-1 infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with M-tropic strains. At the same time, RANTES(3–68), which is a much weaker chemotaxis agonist compared with intact RANTES, can provide negative feedback to weaken the inflammatory response. Although it is at present impossible to discriminate between RANTES(1–68) and RANTES(3–68) in clinical samples, studies on the in vivo balance between both RANTES forms may provide interesting information on the (patho-)physiological role of RANTES(3–68).In conclusion, we have isolated naturally occurring forms of the chemokines GCP-2 and RANTES, missing their NH2-terminal Xaa-Pro motif. We demonstrated that CD26/DPP IV is able to cleave chemokines in vitro into these NH2-terminally truncated forms. Although truncated and intact GCP-2 are equally active, RANTES(3–68) becomes a natural chemotaxis inhibitor and is a more potent inhibitor of HIV-1-infection than intact RANTES. RANTES is the first cytokine reported, of which the biological activity can be modified by CD26/DPP IV. This finding may lead to novel insights on the role of this specific peptidase not only in HIV-infection but also in inflammatory processes and immune responses. Limited NH2-terminal truncation of chemokines has different consequences for their biological potency resulting in either increased (C-X-C chemokines) or decreased (C-C chemokines) specific activity (4Walz A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2599-2603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). During the purification of GCP-2 and RANTES from natural sources, we detected significant quantities (more than 50% of the chemokine content) of NH2-terminally truncated variants missing the first two amino acids (Gly-Pro and Ser-Pro for GCP-2 and RANTES, respectively). We tested whether the exopeptidase CD26/DPP IV was able to process these and other chemokines with a penultimate Pro at their NH2 terminus and whether this cleavage resulted in an altered biological activity. Although the occurrence of the NH2-terminal Xaa-Pro motif as a target for CD26/DPP IV was observed several years ago, the failure of processing mature IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, and other cytokines by CD26/DPP IV indicated that peptides become less susceptible to cleavage by CD26/DPP IV with increasing length (11Fleischer B. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 29Hoffmann T. Faust J. Neubert K. Ansorge S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Indeed, the largest peptide (44 amino acids) reported to be sensitive to NH2-terminal truncation by CD26/DPP IV is growth hormone-releasing hormone (30Frohman L.A. Downs T. Heimer E. Felix A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1533-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this study, two chemokines of about 70 residues with Pro at the penultimate NH2-terminal position, i.e. the C-X-C chemokine GCP-2 and the C-C chemokine RANTES, were processed by CD26/DPP IV, but the C-C chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3 were resistant to degradation by the enzyme. Earlier observations that naturally truncated froms of MCP-1, MCP-2, or MCP-3, missing two NH2-terminal amino acids, were not isolated from various cellular sources (22Proost P. Wuyts A. Conings R. Lenaerts J.-P. Put W. Van Damme J. Methods: Companion Methods in Enzymol. 1996; 10: 82-92Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) confirm the specificity of CD26/DPP IV. Resistance of MCP-2 to CD26/DPP IV is a consequence of the presence of the NH2-terminal pyroglutamic acid, because recombinant MCP-2 with an NH2-terminal Gln was cleaved by CD26/DPP IV (data not shown). The importance of the NH2-terminal residues has been illustrated by chemical synthesis of truncated MCP-1 and MCP-3, which are devoid of monocyte chemotactic activity (8Gong J.-H. Uguccioni M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10521-10527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Gong J.H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Truncation of GCP-2 with CD26/DPP IV had no significant effect on the chemotactic and Ca2+-releasing capacity of the chemokine. In contrast, a 10–100-fold decreased monocyte chemotactic and intracellular Ca2+-releasing activity was detected with RANTES(3–68) processed by CD26/DPP IV. However, RANTES and RANTES(3–68) were reported to be equipotent eosinophil chemotactic proteins (31Noso N. Sticherling M. Bartels J. Mallet A.I. Christophers E. Schröder J.-M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1946-1953PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of different RANTES receptors,i.e. CCR3 on eosinophils compared with CCR1 and CCR5 on mononuclear cells (3Taub D.D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 335-376Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Murphy P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), may explain the different interaction of RANTES(3–68) with both cell types. In addition to monocytes, also memory type CD45RO+ T cells, which express CCR1, CCR5, and CD26, are important target cells for RANTES (32Wu B.L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. Ruffing N. Rottman J.B.

https://openalex.org/W1983566655,"Expression of a constitutively active, membrane-associated Akt-1 (PKB α) construct in 3T3L1 adipocytes was shown to induce glucose uptake in the absence of insulin by stimulating Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane (Kohn, A. D., Summers, S. A., Birnbaum, M. J., and Roth, R. A. (1996)<i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 271, 31372–31378). However, in rat fat cell the vast majority of Akt-1 is cytosolic and shows no re-distribution to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. On the other hand, little work has been done with other Akt family members such as Akt-2 (PKB β) or Akt-3 (PKB γ). In this report, an analysis of the subcellular distribution of Akt-2 in rat adipocytes shows that Akt-2 is present in significant amounts in various membrane compartments, as well as in the cytosol, and the former include the light microsomes where Glut4 is present in the basal state. The distribution of Akt-2 in resting adipocytes was found to substantially overlap with that of Glut4 when light microsomes were subfractionated by a sucrose velocity gradient indicating possible co-localization. We confirmed co-localization of Akt-2 and Glut4 in the basal state by immunopurification of Glut4 vesicles, which exhibited a 5.5-fold increase in Akt-2 in response to insulin relative to the amount of Glut4. These results are consistent with the possibility that Akt-2 may be involved in Glut4 vesicle translocation."

Uncontrolled secretion of IL-2 results in adverse reactions ranging from anergy, to aberrant T cell activation, to autoimmunity. With the use of fluorescent in situ hybridization and single-cell polymerase chain reaction in cells with different IL-2 alleles, IL-2 expression in mature thymocytes and T cells was found to be tightly controlled by monoallelic expression. Because IL-2 is encoded at a nonimprinted autosomal locus, this result represents an unusual regulatory mode for controlling the precise expression of a single gene."

Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar), and is continued to adjacent nucleosome cores through a variable length of linker DNA. In a nucleosome the histone H1 is associated with the outside of the core and protects 168 bp or two full superhelical turns of DNA from MNase cleavage (5Noll M. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 109: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 6Simpson R.T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5521-5524Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Histone H1 was first identified in 1951 as a lysine rich “subsidiary” histone in calf thymus (7Stedman E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1951; 235: 565-595Crossref Google Scholar) and was subsequently shown to be an extended family of histone isotypes or variants present in a wide variety of eukaryotes (8Cole R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although the structural role of the nucleosome core and the spatial placement of the core histones within the octamer are well established (1Richmond T.J. Finch J.T. Rushton B. Rhodes D. Klug A.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 75-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic and hydrodynamic studies have shown that histone H1 is required for the full salt-dependent condensation of chromatin in vitro (11Thoma F. Koller T. Klug A. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 12Butler P.J.G. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 140: 505-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 13Allan J. Cowling G.J. Harborne N. Cattini P. Craigie R. Gould H. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the proposal that the function of the linker histone is the partial neutralization of the negatively charged DNA backbone, allowing the close approach of the internucleosomal linker DNA that would normally coloumbically repel in the fully compacted 30 nm fiber (for a review, see Ref. 14Van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10548-10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar and references cited therein). This role of H1 is supported by the observed reduction in the size of mitotic chromatids and nuclear volume concurrent with the appearance of histone H1 during the mid-blastula transition of the developing Drosophila embryo (15Ner S.S. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is also consistent with the approximately 2-fold expansion of the Tetrahymena micro- or macronucleus in the absence of the four micronuclear-specific micLH polypeptides or macronuclear-specific H1 protein, respectively (16Shen X. Yu L. Weir J.W. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This implied role of H1 in chromatin condensation is dynamic and is modulated by the cell cycle-dependent reversible phosphorylation of H1 by p34cdc2 (reviewed in Refs. 17Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 93-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar and 18Bradbury E.M. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). This modification presumably allows the interaction of additional factors such as the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) class of proteins with chromatin, affecting full condensation into the mitotic chromosome (see Ref. 19Peterson C.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 389-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar for a review). There has been no definitive identification of a linker histone in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although some studies have reported indirect evidence for the existence of an H1-like protein in yeast (20Rattner J.B. Saunders C. Davies J.R. Hamkalo B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Lowary P.T. Widom J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the absence of a direct biochemical identification of the histone led some investigators to suggest that it is absent in yeast (16Shen X. Yu L. Weir J.W. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This proposed lack is unusual, since eukaryotes that phylogenetically diverge both before (such asTetrahymena) and after (such as Psammechinus) yeast have been shown to contain linker histones. The sequencing of chromosome XVI in yeast (24Bussey H. Storms R.K. Ahmed A. Albermann K. Allen E. Ansorge W. Araujo R. Aparicio A. Barrell B. Badcock K. Benes V. Botstein D. Bowman S. Bruckner M.

Williams B.A. Storms R.K. Yeast. 1997; 13: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have shown that the predicted open reading frame is functional and that a fusion of the gene product with fluorescent green protein is located in the nucleus. These results contributed to the assignment of YPL127C as the HHO1 gene which was proposed to encode the yeast linker histone H1 (Hho1p) (25Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 287-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ushinsky S.C. Bussey H. Ahmed A.A. Wang Y. Friesen J. Williams B.A. Storms R.K. Yeast. 1997; 13: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). There are no other genes in the yeast genome that code for proteins with significant sequence similarities to H1 (25Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 287-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we biochemically address the assignment of Hho1p as the yeast H1 linker histone. In particular, we investigated the ability of this protein to stably associate with a reconstituted core di-nucleosome and to confer an MNase kinetic pause at approximately 168 bp in H1-stripped chromatin in vitro. The phenotype of a yeast strain in which the HHO1 gene has been deleted was also studied. We specifically investigated the effect of the absence of Hho1p on cell viability, growth rate, mating efficiency, basal transcription levels, telomeric repression, sporulation efficiency, chromatin structure, and Sin and Spt phenotypes. Genomic DNA was isolated from yeast strain FY24 as described by Zhu et al.(29Zhu J. Newlon C.S. Huberman J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4733-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A 1500-bp region between positions 308,523 and 310,024 on yeast chromosome XVI (24Bussey H. Storms R.K. Ahmed A. Albermann K. Allen E. Ansorge W. Araujo R. Aparicio A. Barrell B. Badcock K. Benes V.

Hani J. et al.Nature. 1997; 387: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), incorporating the entire HHO1 open reading frame and 303 bp upstream and 420 bp downstream, was amplified with Taq DNA polymerase and template mismatched primers to introduce EcoRI and XbaI sites at the fragment ends, as described (30Patterton H.-G. von Holt C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 637-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The recovered fragment was digested withEcoRI and XbaI and ligated into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the plasmid pRS413 (31Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst .). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar) lacking the 2688-bp PmlI-EcoRV fragment. The resulting plasmid was denoted pHHO1, and the sequence of the insert confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. This plasmid was further modified by introducing a 1185-bp fragment containing the HIS3 gene into the BamHI and SphI sites of the HHO1 sequence, and the proper insertion of the HIS3 gene in the plasmid, denoted pHHO1-HIS3, was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. This manipulation removes the sequence coding for amino acids 63–187 of Hho1p, including the entire primary globular domain C-terminal to helix I, the lysine-rich interglobular region, and the assigned secondary globular domain N-terminal of helix II (25Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 287-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An Escherichia coli expression vector, pET20-HHO1, was constructed by ligating an NdeI/XhoI restricted 789-bp fragment containing the HHO1 coding sequence into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pET20b(+) (Novagen). This construct codes for the entire Hho1p protein and introduces six histidine residues at the Hho1p C terminus. The HHO1 deletion strain was constructed by electroporating strain YPH500ΔL (32Kladde M.P. Xu M. Simpson R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6290-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with the 1.5-kilobase pairEcoRI/XbaI fragment from pHHO1-HIS3. The recombination of the partially replaced HHO1 open reading frame to the proper locus in the recovered histidine prototrophs was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and Southern hybridization. This strain was denoted YHGP101. Genetic crosses and tetrad dissections were performed as described in Ref. 33Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual.

The cells were lysed by sonication (20% duty cycle at setting 6 on a Branson model 450 sonicator), and the cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation (18,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a Sorval SS34 rotor). The recovered supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-agarose column (1-ml bed volume), equilibrated in binding buffer. The column was washed with 25 ml of binding buffer, followed by 15 ml of 40 mm imidazole, 200 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.9). The recombinant protein was eluted from the column with 300 mm imidazole, 200 mmNaCl, and 20 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.9), and 500-μl fractions were collected. Fractions enriched in recombinant Hho1p were identified by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, pooled, and loaded onto a CM-Sephadex column (1-ml bed volume) equilibrated in phosphate buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.25 mm EDTA, and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 200 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 10 ml of the same buffer and developed with 10 ml of a 200–1000 mm NaCl linear gradient in phosphate buffer. Fractions (500 μl) containing pure recombinant Hho1p were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated, and the buffer was replaced with 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.25 mm EDTA, and 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with a P10 centricon device (Amicon). The samples were stored frozen at −70 °C. The rHho1p concentration was determined by the absorbance at 230 nm using anE1% of 18.5 (34Camerini-Otero R.D. Sollner-Webb B. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1976; 8: 333-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) sensitivity of a strain was determined by diluting 1 ml of an overnight culture to an A600 of 1.0, and 10 μl of this culture, serially diluted 10-fold, was applied to a complete synthetic medium (CSM, 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 20 g/liter glucose, 0.7 g/liter amino acid supplement (Bio 101), and 20 g/liter bacto agar) plate lacking the appropriate amino acid in the absence or presence of 0.1% (w/v) 5-fluoroorotic acid (Jersey Laboratories). The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days. The sporulation efficiency of a strain was determined by inoculating a single diploid colony into 10 ml of pre-sporulation medium (0.25% (w/v) glucose, 1% (w/v) potassium acetate, 0.6% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, and 0.5% (w/v) bacto peptone) and incubating the culture with vigorous shaking at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.5–0.6. The cells were pelleted, washed in sporulation medium (1% (w/v) potassium acetate, all auxotrophic supplements at 0.25 × shown in Ref. 33Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1990Google Scholar), resuspended in 5-ml volumes of sporulation medium to anA600 of 0.2, and incubated at 22 °C for 5 days. The sporulation efficiency of a culture was quantified by counting the number of tetrads relative to the total number of cells and tetrads in a hemocytometer. The β-galactosidase assays were performed as described in Ref.35Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1992; 68: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar. The 390-bp32P-labeled fragment (10 ng) containing a tandem dimer of the sea urchin 5 S rRNA gene was incubated with 40 μg of H1-stripped HeLa chromatin (a gift from M. Vignali and T. Owen-Hughes) in a 100-μl volume of reconstitution buffer (10 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8.0), 0.25 mm EDTA and 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1000 mm NaCl at 37 °C for 30 min. The ionic strength was reduced to 800 and 600 mm NaCl by the sequential addition of reconstitution buffer at 30-min intervals at 37 °C. Where rHho1p was added, the sample was split into aliquots following the dilution to 600 mm NaCl, and rHho1p was added in the amounts indicated in the text. The dilution of fractions in the presence or absence of rHho1p was continued to 400 mm NaCl after 30 min, followed by a stepwise 2-fold dilution with reconstitution buffer at 37 °C at 30-min intervals to a final concentration of 12.5 mm NaCl. Aliquots (20 μl) were run on a 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel in 0.5× TBE at 100 V, and the gel was dried and autoradiographed. The reconstitution of H1-stripped HeLa chromatin with Hho1p was performed exactly as described, except that the 5 S rRNA gene dimer fragment was omitted, and rHho1p was added at a molar ratio of 1:1 (Hho1p:core). This and a similarly treated sample lacking Hho1p were digested with concentrations of MNase indicated in the text. The digestion products were purified and electrophoresed on an 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE at 150 V. The preparation of nuclei, digestion of chromatin and free DNA, and the primer extension of the recovered DNA template were performed as described previously (30Patterton H.-G. von Holt C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 637-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We investigated the assigned identity of Hho1p as a linker histone in yeast by studying the properties of a recombinant Hho1p (rHho1p). Histidine-tagged rHho1p was overexpressed in E. coli cells and isolated from the sonicated cell lysate by passage over a nickel-agarose column (Fig. 1 A). The identity of the band indicated as rHho1p (Fig. 1 A) was confirmed by its absence in identically performed mock isolations from E. colicontaining only the vector without the HHO1 coding sequence. Although the amino acid sequence of Hho1p predicts a molecular mass of approximately 28 kDa, the protein migrates at a size equivalent to approximately 33 kDa during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, A and B). This anomalously slow electrophoretic behavior closely resembles that of linker histones from other species (36Cole R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and is likely due to the basicity of the protein, which has a predicted isoelectric point of 10.2. The recovered rHho1p was next purified from contaminating nickel-agarose binding E. coli proteins by passage over a cation exchange resin, eluted by a linear salt gradient. Recombinant Hho1p eluted off the cation exchange column at approximately 700 mm NaCl (Fig. 1 B). This chromatographic trait of rHho1p is also very similar to that of linker histones from higher eukaryotes (37Clark D.J. Thomas J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These properties, however, reflect only the amino acid composition of the protein and not its proposed function as a linker histone. We therefore tested the ability of the purified recombinant protein to conform to two common characteristics of a linker histone: (i) to form a stable ternary complex with a reconstituted nucleosome core in vitro, and (ii) to produce a kinetic pause at approximately 168 bp in the MNase digestion pattern of H1-stripped native chromatin. Several investigators have shown that both the full-length and globular domain of recombinant and native linker histones can be reconstituted with nucleosome cores in vitro(13Allan J. Cowling G.J. Harborne N. Cattini P. Craigie R. Gould H. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Since the proposed role of histone H1 is the neutralization of the charge of the internucleosomal linker DNA, we chose to investigate the association of rHho1p with a reconstituted core di-nucleosome, which contains a short length of linker DNA and is expected to resemble a natural H1 substrate more closely. A 390-bp radiolabeled fragment containing a tandem repeat of sea urchin 5 S DNA (39Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) was reconstituted into a di-nucleosome in the presence of a range of rHho1p concentrations, and the reconstitution products were electrophoretically resolved on an agarose gel (Fig. 2). Addition of rHho1p to the core di-nucleosome resulted in the formation of two slower migrating species. The faster migrating of these two species (N1) appears at lower molar Hho1p input ratios and decreases toward higher input ratios, concurrent with an increase in the slower migrating complex (N2). At a molar input ratio of one molecule of rHho1p per core, essentially all of the core di-nucleosome exists as the N2 species. At higher molar input ratios or at ionic strengths in excess of approximately 100 mm NaCl, the reconstitute aggregates and does not enter the gel matrix. This result clearly demonstrates that rHho1p forms a stable ternary complex with a reconstituted core di-nucleosome. The apparent conversion of the N1 to the N2 species as a function of rHho1p input suggests that at lower rHho1p ratios a single molecule of rHho1p binds to the core di-nucleosome forming the N1 complex. At higher rHho1p:core ratios a second molecule of rHho1p binds to the N1 complex, resulting in the appearance of the N2 complex. The presence of histone H1 in chromatin protects an additional 10 bp of DNA on either side of the nucleosome core from exonucleolytic MNase digestion, resulting in the appearance of a digestion intermediate of approximately 168 bp prior to trimming to 146 bp and subsequent sub-nucleosomal length fragments (5Noll M. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 109: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar,6Simpson R.T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5521-5524Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The appearance of the kinetic pause at ∼168 bp was shown to require the basic amino acid residues Lys-40 and Arg-42 between helix I and helix II and Lys-52 on helix II (40Goytisolo F.A. Gerchman S.E.

https://openalex.org/W2142318878,"Ubiquitination is a covalent protein modification that can target proteins in eukaryotic cells for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Substrates for this degradation pathway include abnormal proteins that arise from misfolding and/or mutation. How and when the ubiquitination machinery recognizes misfolded proteins and targets them for degradation remains largely unknown. We have previously shown that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), is rapidly degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent fashion, without any detectable lag following its synthesis (Ward, C. L., and Kopito, R. R. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 25710-25718), suggesting that ubiquitination and protein synthesis may be temporally linked. In the present study, we have investigated the timing of CFTR ubiquitination relative to its translation in reticulocyte lysates containing 125I-ubiquitin. In synchronized, proteasome-inhibited lysates, translation of full-length CFTR chains was completed in approximately 30 min, whereas modification of CFTR with [125I]ubiquitin was evident by 20 min, indicating that ubiquitination precedes the completion of full-length polypeptide chains. Moreover, ubiquitin was also found to be transferred to nascent CFTR chains while attached to ribosomes. Together, these data establish that ubiquitination, which is widely assumed to be a post-translational event, can occur cotranslationally and suggest a role for ubiquitination early in protein biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2024830340,"Sphingolipid-related metabolites have been implicated as potential signaling molecules in many studies with mammalian cells as well as in some studies with yeast. Our previous work showed that sphingolipid-deficient strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are unable to resist a heat shock, indicating that sphingolipids are necessary for surviving heat stress. Recent evidence suggests that one role for the sphingolipid intermediate ceramide may be to act as a second messenger to signal accumulation of the thermoprotectant trehalose. We examine here the mechanism for generating the severalfold increase in ceramide observed during heat shock. As judged by compositional analysis and mass spectrometry, the major ceramides produced during heat shock are similar to those found in complex sphingolipids, a mixture of N-hydroxyhexacosanoyl C18 and C20phytosphingosines. Since the most studied mechanism for ceramide generation in animal cells is via a phospholipase C-type sphingomyelin hydrolysis, we examined S. cerevisiae for an analogous enzyme. Using [3H]phytosphingosine and [3H]inositol-labeled yeast sphingolipids, a novel membrane-associated phospholipase C-type activity that generated ceramide from inositol-P-ceramide, mannosylinositol-P-ceramide, and mannose(inositol-P)2-ceramide was demonstrated. The sphingolipid head groups were concomitantly liberated with the expected stoichiometry. However, other data demonstrate that the ceramide generated during heat shock is not likely to be derived by breakdown of complex sphingolipids. For example, the water-soluble fraction of heat-shocked cells showed no increase in any of the sphingolipid head groups, which is inconsistent with complex sphingolipid hydrolysis. Rather, we find that de novo ceramide synthesis involving ceramide synthase appears to be responsible for heat-induced ceramide elevation. In support of this hypothesis, we find that the potent ceramide synthase inhibitor, australifungin, completely inhibits both the heat-induced increase in incorporation of [3H]sphinganine into ceramide as well as the heat-induced increase in ceramide as measured by mass. Thus, heat-induced ceramide most likely arises by temperature activation of the enzymes that generate ceramide precursors, activation of ceramide synthase itself, or both.

Widespread research, primarily in mammalian cells, has focused on sphingolipids as possible mediators of stress responses. Sphingolipid metabolites such as sphingosine, sphingosine-phosphate, and ceramide have been proposed as signaling molecules in a host of cellular processes (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Hannun Y.A.

Ligand-activated sphingomyelinase activity acting on plasma membrane sphingomyelin is the most studied mechanism for generating the second messenger ceramide (5Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 27-41PubMed Google Scholar). Some reports suggest an alternative mechanism; altered ceramide synthase activity produces the ceramide increase seen in apoptosis (6Bose R.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an exemplary organism in which to sort out the sphingolipid-related genes and proteins necessary for mounting a response to stress. Not only has the genome sequence been determined, but the sphingolipid composition is relatively simple as compared with mammals. The principal ceramide of S. cerevisiae, phytosphingosine (4-OH sphinganine)N-acylated with an α-OH C26 fatty acid, is phosphodiester-linked to inositol (IPC), 1The abbreviations used are: IPC, inositolphosphorylceramide; MIPC, mannosylinositolphosphorylceramide; M(IP)2C, mannosyldiinositolphosphorylceramide; sphingolipid species III, ceramide composed of phytosphingosine and α-OH hexacosanoic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: IPC, inositolphosphorylceramide; MIPC, mannosylinositolphosphorylceramide; M(IP)2C, mannosyldiinositolphosphorylceramide; sphingolipid species III, ceramide composed of phytosphingosine and α-OH hexacosanoic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. mannosylinositol (MIPC), or inositolphosphorylmannosylinositol (M(IP)2C) (8Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 26: 253-272PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of the Saccharomycesinositolphosphoceramides is schematized in Fig. 1, indicating inhibition of ceramide synthase by the potent antifungal agent australifungin (9Mandala S.M.

Antibiotics. 1995; 48: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids were first implicated in stress responses in S. cerevisiae when it was observed that strains unable to make sphingolipids failed to grow under conditions such as high temperature, high osmotic pressure, and low pH, whereas such strains could withstand these stresses when cultured so as to contain sphingolipids (10Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Subsequent reports implicated sphingolipids in signaling roles in S. cerevisiae. N-Acetyl sphingosine (C2-ceramide) was shown by some (11Fishbein J.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9255-9261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nickels J.T. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) but not all (13Ella K.M.

Shifting the temperature from 24 to 39 °C is known to induce a variety of responses such as heat shock protein synthesis (14Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 457-494Google Scholar) and trehalose accumulation (see Ref. 15Parrou J.L. Teste M.A. Francois J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1891-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar and references cited therein). We recently demonstrated that such a temperature shift caused a severalfold elevation of ceramide (16Wells, G. B., Dickson, R. C., and Lester, R. L. (1996)Annual Meeting of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, New Orleans, LA, June 1996, Abstr.

Tillman P. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30196-30200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Recent work also indicates that sphingolipids could be involved in the trehalose accumulation response, including the failure to accumulate trehalose in sphingolipid-deficient cells, exogenous sphinganine induction of trehalose accumulation in wild type cells, and exogenous sphinganine induction of the transcription of the TPS2 gene required for trehalose synthesis (17Dickson R.C.

In this paper, we examine the biochemical basis for the heat-induced ceramide elevation. A recent study has raised questions concerning the validity of many reports of ceramide elevation based on using diacylglycerol kinase to measure ceramide (18Watts J.D. Gu M. Polverino A.J. Patterson S.D. Aebersold R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7292-7296Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We have used direct chemical methods to establish the nature of the heat-induced ceramides in S. cerevisiae. We show that, although there exists a membrane-associated phosphodiesterase C-type enzyme activity that generates ceramide from yeast sphingolipids, it appears that the heat-induced ceramide increase results from de novosynthesis rather than from phosphodiesterase-mediated sphingolipid catabolism. This finding is different from the most studied explanation of ceramide elevation in mammalian cells, namely stimulated sphingomyelinase activity as part of a “sphingomyelin cycle” (5Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 27-41PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramides were prepared from autolysed commercial bakers' yeast (Fleischmann) by modifications of the procedure of Oda and Kamiya (19Oda T. Kamiya H. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1958; 6: 682-687Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). C18-Celite was prepared as follows. Acid-washed Celite 545 (Fisher) freed of phosphate impurities was treated with 10% octadecyltrichlorosilane (PCR Research Chemicals, Inc.) in toluene overnight at room temperature, washed with toluene and methanol, and dried under vacuum. Silica gel-impregnated paper (Whatman SG-81) was treated with EDTA as described (20Steiner S. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 81-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complex media consisted of 4% glucose, 1% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 1% KH2PO4, 0.05 m sodium succinate, pH 5.5, 0.05% Tergitol, 10 mg of myo-inositol/liter. S. cerevisiae strain YPH252 (MATα ura3–52 lys2–801 amber ade2–201 ochre trp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200 leu2Δ1) (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used throughout unless otherwise noted. Where indicated, strains RCD113 (MATa ura3–52 lys2–801 amber ade2–101 ochre trp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 ipt1-Δ1) (22Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Wells G.B. Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. J. Biol.

Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were employed. Australifungin was a generous gift of Dr. S. Mandala (Merck). N-[4,5-3H]Acetylsphinganine (1.5 × 107 dpm/nmol), prepared as described (23Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), was hydrolyzed with 1.0 n HCl in methanol-H2O (82:18) for 18 h at 80 °C. After removing unhydrolyzed acetylsphinganine by twice extracting with 2 volumes of hexane, the hydrolysate was dried and stored in 95% ethanol. Aliquots were dried and dispersed in 0.5% Tergitol in a sonic bath prior to the addition to culture medium. Free ceramides were extracted from cells, perbenzoylated, and quantitated after HPLC as described previously (23Nagiec M.M. Nagiec E.E. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9809-9817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Underivatized ceramide was sometimes directly analyzed. The initial chloroform/methanol (1:1) extract was filtered (Gelman 0.45 μ ACRO LC3S filters), dried, and dissolved in 200 μl of chloroform. A 50-μl aliquot was subjected to HPLC on a 0.45 × 30-cm 5 μ Lichrosorb Si 60 column equilibrated with chloroform and eluted (1 ml/min) with 1 ml of chloroform followed by a 19-min linear gradient between chloroform and chloroform/methanol (3:1). Ceramide-III eluted at about 15 min and was detected with a Varex evaporative light scattering detector (drift tube temperature, 70 °C; nitrogen flow rate, 1.1 liters/min). An overnight culture grown at 24 °C (2 liters;A650 = 1.0) was warmed to 39 °C and incubated with shaking for 40 min, followed by termination with trichloroacetic acid to 5%. The water-washed cell pellet was extracted with 60 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) at 50 °C for 30 min and centrifuged while warm, and the supernatant was dried and suspended in 2 ml of chloroform. The extract was applied to a 6-ml silica gel column (Adsorbosil, 100–200 mesh, Applied Science Labs) equilibrated with chloroform, and eluted with 9 ml of chloroform, 9 ml of chloroform/methanol (9:1), and 9 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1). Ceramide-III assay by HPLC of the three fractions showed 0, 471, and 34 nmol, respectively. Fraction 2 was further purified by HPLC on a 0.45 × 30-cm column of 5-μm Lichrosorb Si60 (Merck) equilibrated with chloroform. The elution schedule (flow rate of 1 ml/min) was 1 min chloroform, 19 min linear gradient between chloroform and chloroform/methanol (75:25). The eluate was monitored with a Varex evaporative light scattering detector, and the fractions expected for ceramide-III were pooled, dried, and dissolved in chloroform. Final purification was on the same Lichrosorb column with isocratic elution with chloroform/methanol (9:1). The final ceramide fraction was analyzed for long chain base and fatty acid (24Dickson R.C. Wells G.B. Schmidt A. Lester R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2176-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as well as assayed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. Part of the sample was benzoylated and separated by HPLC by a scaled up version of the protocol described above for quantitative ceramide analysis. Samples from each of the twin peaks were subjected to electron impact mass spectrometry. Positive ion fast atom bombardment spectra of underivatized ceramides were measured with a Concept IH (Kratos) two-sector mass spectrometer equipped with an Ion Tech Ltd. saddle field gun operating with a xenon gas and set at a resolution of about 1500 at the acceleration voltage of 5.3 kV. Samples (∼2 nmol/2 μl) in methylene chloride were added to 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol matrix (2–3 μl) on a 7-mm diameter stainless steel probe tip. Spectra were acquired in a raw data mode, in a 100–2100 atomic mass unit range, 3 s per decade, using external CsI mass calibration. Spectra representing the best response were averaged and digitally smoothed. Electron impact mass spectra of perbenzoylceramides were measured at 70 eV using a CONCEPT IH (Kratos) two-sector instrument. Samples on the platinum wire were directly introduced to the ion source at 250 °C. Spectra were acquired from 40 to 1400 atomic mass units, 3 s per decade, and the instrument was set to about 2000 atomic mass units resolving power. Sphingolipids labeled with either [3H]inositol or [3H]phytosphingosine were prepared by metabolic labeling. Ethanol solutions of myo-[2-3H]inositol (1 mCi, NEN Life Science Products) or [4,5-3H]sphinganine (775 × 106 dpm; prepared as described above) were dried in a sterile culture flask, sonic treated with 10 ml of culture medium, inoculated with a starter culture of strain YPH252 to a starting A650 of 0.2, and shaken for 22 h at 30 °C, the A650 reaching 11. The cells were treated with trichloroacetic acid (5% final concentration), centrifuged, and washed twice with water. Lipids were extracted by treating each pellet with 2 ml of solvent B (diethylether, 95% ethanol, water, pyridine; 5:15:15:1 (v/v/v/v) containing 0.5 ml/liter concentrated ammonia) for 30 min at 60 °C. Further purification proceeded by slightly different routes. The solvent B extract from the [4,5-3H]sphinganine-labeled cells was added to a 1-ml column of BioRex 70 resin (H+ form, 200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad) in a Pasteur pipette (packed in water and equilibrated with methanol) and washed with 3 ml of solvent B followed by 2 ml of methanol. The eluates, now free of long chain bases, were combined, dried, and dissolved in 1 ml of solvent B. Acyl ester lipids were deacylated by adding 1 ml of 0.2 n KOH in methanol and incubating for 30 min at room temperature. Further work up by adsorbtion to and elution from a Chelex resin C18 Celite mixture was as described previously (25Wells G.B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6223-6226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sphingolipid fraction was dried and suspended in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and applied to a 3-ml column of silica gel (Adsorbosil, 100/200 mesh, Applied Sciences, Inc.) equilibrated with chloroform/methanol (1:1), and neutral catabolites of [4,5-3H]sphinganine (∼11% of the radioactivity) were eluted with 6 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1). The [3H]sphingolipids were eluted with 15 ml of solvent A containing three drops of concentrated ammonia/5 ml. Only radioactive sphingolipids were evident by thin layer chromatography (yield, 170 × 106 dpm). The solvent B extract from the [3H]inositol-labeled cells was deacylated directly and purified over a C18-Celite column as above; this procedure was repeated once. Thin layer chromatography of the final base-stable Celite eluates showed all the radioactivity to be in various species of sphingolipids (yield, 99 × 106 dpm). Separation into molecular species was carried out by thin layer chromatography (Whatman HP-K 200 μm; 10 × 20 cm, solvent C). Each radioactive zone was eluted with solvent A, dried, dissolved in 1 ml of solvent A, and filtered (Acrodisc 4 CR 4 mm; 0.45-μm filters, Gelman Sciences, Inc.). Purity and identity was verified by subjecting each molecular species to high performance thin layer chromatography as above. Unlabeled standards were incorporated in each lane and were detected by charring (25Wells G.B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6223-6226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after the radioactivity was located (BioScan apparatus). The reaction mixtures (0.3 ml) consisted of 22 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.6%n-octyl-β-glucopyranoside, 0.22 μg of membrane (27Pinto W.J. Wells G.W. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2575-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) protein. Also added were 10 nmol of unlabeled sphingolipid (IPC-III, MIPC-III, or M(IP)2C-III) and equal amounts of radioactivity of the corresponding [3H]inositol- and [3H]sphinganine-labeled sphingolipids: IPC-III, 101,000 cpm; MIPC-III, 39,000 cpm; M(IP)2C-III, 200,000 cpm. The sphingolipids were dried and suspended by sonic treatment in the assay mixture before the addition of enzyme. After 60 min at 24 °C, the reaction was terminated by 2-min heating (100 °C) followed by adding 30 μl of 0.5 m Na-EDTA, pH 7.1. Aliquots were chromatographed on silica gel paper (solvent C). One-cm zones were subjected to scintillation counting. Water-soluble products were at the origin, ceramides migrated near the solvent front, and sphingolipids migrated at these RFs: IPC-III, 0.65; MIPC-III, 0.54; M(IP)2C-III, 0.30. Separate 20-μl aliquots of the reaction mixtures were chromatographed on silica gel paper with the solvent chloroform/methanol (19:1.5, v/v) along with ceramide-III standard. Radioactivity was determined for each lane as above. Water-soluble products as well as the phosphosphingolipids remain at the origin with this solvent, while ceramide-III migrates to anRF factor of 0.66. To identify the water-soluble fragments of sphingolipids resulting from a putative phospholipase C reaction, 106 cpm each of [3H]inositol-labeled IPC-III and M(IP)2C-III were incubated as above except that no unlabeled sphingolipid was added, and the reaction was carried out for 4 h, adding an equal amount of membranes after 2 h. The reaction was terminated as above. To each sample was added 30 μl of 0.5 m Na-EDTA, pH 7.1. Aliquots were chromatographed on silica gel paper (solvent C). Radioactivity in each lane was quantitated as described above. The polar product(s) at the origin derived from IPC-III and M(IP)2C-III were 44 and 16% of the total counts, respectively. Water-soluble products were separated by ion exchange chromatography by diluting the reaction mixtures with 5 ml of water followed by centrifugation and application of the supernatant to a 0.6 × 81-cm column of AG1-X2 (200–400 mesh bicarbonate form, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 50 ml of 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. Elution was with 0.3 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9 (flow rate 1.22 ml/min), collecting 8.8-ml fractions. Radioactive peaks were located and quantitated, pooled, and driedin vacuo at 70 °C to remove ammonium bicarbonate. Some of each pooled peak was dissolved in 0.1 ml of 0.2 m ammonium acetate, pH 8.6, treated with 30 μl of Escherichia colialkaline phosphatase (type III, Sigma, 0.33 units/μl) for 3 h at room temperature, diluted with 2 ml of water, and chromatographed/quantitated on an AG1-X2 column exactly as described above. Another portion of the pooled peaks was dried and treated with 1 ml of 10 n NH4OH for 18 h at 150 °C. The labeled ammonolysis products, mannosylinositol and inositol, were resolved by thin layer chromatography (Whatman HP-K) and developed with acetonitrile/water (3:1), followed by detection/quantitation with a BioScan apparatus. The reaction mixture was 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.6% n-octyl-β-glucopyranoside, 33.3 μm [3H]sphingolipid (∼105cpm), 100–400 μg of membrane protein in a 0.3-ml volume. The [3H]sphingolipids were added to the reaction tube, dried, and suspended by sonic treatment with the assay mixture before the addition of enzyme. After incubation for 60 min at 24 °C, the reaction was terminated and processed by two different methods. Sodium dodecylsulfate (0.9 ml, 2.27%) was added to the reaction mixture. Ceramide was extracted from the mixture with two 2-ml portions of methyl tert-butylether. The pooled extracts were washed with 1 ml of water and dried, and radioactivity was measured. A small no enzyme blank reaction, equivalent to <1% apparent substrate breakdown, was subtracted from the membrane-containing samples to calculate the specific activity. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and centrifuged. The supernatant was added to a 1-ml column of AG4-X4 (acetate form, 100–200 mesh, Bio-Rad; packed in water and equilibrated with methanol) and eluted with 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1). The substrates bound to the resin. The eluted ceramide was dried and assayed for radioactivity. A no enzyme blank value was subtracted. An overnight log phase culture was transferred to 15 ml of fresh medium containing 1.5 mCi of myo-[2-3H]inositol (American Radiochemicals, Inc.) to give a starting A650 = 0.2 and cultured for 6 h at 24 °C. The cells were rapidly resuspended in 15 ml of fresh nonradioactive medium and divided in three parts. One part (zero time) was centrifuged, and the pellet was quenched with 1 ml of 1m HClO4. The other two parts were incubated at 24 and 39 °C for 20 min followed by rapid centrifugation and quenching of the cell pellets with HClO4 as above, yielding HClO4 extracts and culture medium fractions, which were filtered (0.2-μ Teflon Acrodiscs CR, Gelman Sciences). After standing for 15 min at 0 °C, the HClO4-treated cell pellets were frozen and thawed twice in dry ice/ethanol and centrifuged at 0 °C. The supernatants were slowly neutralized (chlorophenol red pH indicator) at 0 °C with 2.6 m KOH and centrifuged, and the final supernatants were reserved for ion exchange chromatographic analysis. The cell pellets were washed twice with water and extracted for sphingolipids with 1 ml of solvent B for 30 min at 60 °C, followed by centrifugation while warm. The extract was dried and deacylated by treatment with 0.5 ml of monomethylamine reagent (28Clarke N.G. Dawson R.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 50 °C. After evaporation of the reagent, the sample was dissolved in 1 ml of solvent A, and aliquots were chromatographed on silica gel paper (solvent C). One-cm zones from each lane were analyzed by scintillation counting to give three groups: the counts near the origin, representing deacylated phosphatidylinositol, the M(IP)2C zone, and the zones representing incompletely resolved MIPC plus IPC. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of the three neutralized HClO4 extracts as well as the filtered culture media were diluted 10- and 20-fold, respectively, with water and applied to 0.6 × 81-cm columns of AG-1-X2 200–400 mesh resin equilibrated with 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. Elution was carried out at 1.2 ml/min with 0.3 m ammonium bicarbonate, collecting 20 8.6-ml fractions, which were analyzed for radioactivity. Peak fraction numbers for labeled products were as follows: inositol, 2; glycerophosphorylinositol, 4; inositol-P and mannosylinositol-P, 6; mannose-(inositol-P)2, 11. About 7.5 A650 units of mid-log phase cells were suspended in 5 ml of fresh medium containing 47 × 106 cpm [3H]sphinganine and incubated at 24 or 39 °C. Aliquots (1.4 ml) were removed and terminated with 0.07 ml of 100% trichloroacetic acid and incubated at least 15 min on ice. The cells were centrifuged and washed twice with 1 ml of cold water, and the final pellet was extracted with 0.4 ml of solvent B for 30 min at 60 °C. After centrifuging while still warm, the soluble extract was processed for further analysis. For labeled ceramide analysis, [3H]sphinganine was first removed by applying the solvent B extract to a 0.5-ml column of BioRex 70 (H+) resin (200–400 mesh) packed in water and equilibrated with methanol. Elution was carried out with 1.5 ml of solvent A and then with 1 ml of methanol. The combined eluates were dried and dissolved in 0.2 ml of solvent A and subjected to thin layer chromatography (Whatman K5 plates, solvent CHCl3/methanol, 19:1.5). To each lane, 3.5 nmol of ceramide-III was added. Following radioactivity determination (BioScan apparatus), the plates were sprayed with 10% (w/v) CuSO4·5H2O in 8% H3PO4 and charred at 160 °C (26Fewster M.E. Burns B.J. Mead J.F. J. Chromatogr. 1969; 43: 120-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to locate the added ceramide standard. The total radioactivity in the ceramide zone was calculated from the BioRex 70 eluates and from the percentage distribution of radioactivity from the BioScan analysis of the thin layer plates. For phosphosphingolipid analysis, the solvent B extract was dried and deacylated with 0.5 ml of monomethylamine reagent as above followed by thin layer chromatography (200-μ Whatman HP-K plates, solvent C). Each lane contained a mixture of sphingolipid standards, 1–2 μg each of IPC-III, IPC-III, MIPC-III, and M(IP)2C-III. Following radioactivity determination (BioScan apparatus), the added sphingolipid standards were located by charring (26Fewster M.E. Burns B.J. Mead J.F. J.

The precise functional roles of the intracellular domains of the family of receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins remain unclear. The seven-membrane span core motif for such receptors is fairly compact presenting a relatively small surface area at the cytoplasmic membrane face. Thus, the intracellular domains assume a significant structural presence within the receptor's microenvironment and likely play a role in receptor trafficking, signaling efficiency, receptor phosphorylation, and signal termination.

As part of a continuing effort to define such a signal transduction complex we used modular receptor domains to identify interacting proteins and the subdomains participating in such interactions. We initially focused on the i3 loop of muscarinic receptor (MR) subtypes. The M2- and M4-MR primarily couple to the pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins Gi/Go (4Felder C.C.

As is the case with most members of this receptor superfamily, there is considerable flexibility in the type of G-protein activated by a given receptor. Both the M2-MR and the M3-MR are phosphorylated by the receptor kinase GRK2 in an agonist-dependent manner (7Haga K. Haga T. J. Biol.

Receptor phosphorylation is a key regulatory event in the processing of external stimuli by the cell. There are three components required for effective receptor phosphorylation: 1) lipid, 2) Gβγ, and 3) an activated conformation of the receptor (10DebBurman S.K. Ptasienski J. Boetticher E.

In the present manuscript, we report the direct interaction of Gβγ with the i3 loop of the M2-MR and M3-MR. The interaction of Gβγ with the i3 loop was dependent upon G-protein activation and resulted in the formation of a ternary complex consisting of the i3 peptide, Gβγ, and GRK2 essentially positioning the enzyme on its substrate. In addition to its role in receptor regulation, the interaction of Gβγ with the i3 loop may also facilitate the interface of G-protein-coupled receptors to diverse signaling pathways via complex formation with additional Gβγ-binding proteins. Heterotrimer G-protein and Gβγ dimer were purified from bovine brain as described previously (17Dingus J. Wilcox M.D. Kohnken R. Hildebrandt J.D.

The M3-MR i3 peptide (Arg252-Gln490; MW = 26,471 plus GST) and the M3-MR carboxyl terminus (Asn547-Leu589; MW = 5,351 plus GST) constructs were generated by DNA amplification using the polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the pGEX-4T-1 vector. To generate the M3-MR i1 peptide (Lys93-Tyr104; MW = 1,449 plus GST) and the M3-MR i2 peptide (Asp164-Lys182; MW = 2,374 plus GST) constructs, complementary oligonucleotides from these regions were synthesized and annealed prior to ligation into the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the pGEX-4T-1 vector. The structure of each construct used in the present study was verified by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis. GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose matrix as described previously (1Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

GST and GST fusion proteins were eluted from the resin with 10 mmglutathione and subsequently concentrated/desalted by ultrafiltration (Centricon 3). Purified receptor subdomains (∼5 μg) immobilized on a glutathione resin (2–10 μl of packed resin) or eluted from the resin were incubated with G-protein or GRK2 in a total volume of 250 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 70 mm NaCl, 0.01% Thesit) at 4 °C for 90 min with gentle rotation. In experiments using receptor subdomains not tethered to resin, samples were subsequently incubated with 10 μl of packed resin at 4 °C for 20 min with gentle rotation. The resin was washed three times with 0.5 ml of buffer A at 4 °C, and the retained proteins were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and applied to a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel.

The incubation conditions for phosphorylation reactions were essentially as described previously for the intact M2-MR, M3-MR, and β-adrenergic receptor (AR) (10DebBurman S.K. Ptasienski J.

Briefly, the reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 7 mm MgCl2) containing 2–4 pmol of the GST-M3-MR i3 peptide fusion protein and 50 nmGRK2 with or without various additions as described in the figure legends. Unless indicated otherwise, all phosphorylation reactions contained 300 μm PI. The reactions were initiated by addition of 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (500–1000 cpm/pmol) and incubated at 30 °C for 40 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 50 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and subsequently exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for 1 to 12 h. The amount of peptide phosphorylation was determined by cutting the phosphorylated bands from the gel and quantitation by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The interaction of G-protein subunits with the i3 peptides (M2-MR i3 = His208-Arg387, M3-MR i3 = Arg252-Gln490) was first addressed using heterotrimeric G-protein or dissociated G-protein subunits. The i3 peptides were bound to a glutathione-Sepharose matrix and incubated with bovine brain G-protein in the presence of GDP/EDTA or GTPγS/Mg2+, which would either stabilize the heterotrimer or promote subunit dissociation, respectively. The resin was washed, and retained proteins were determined by SDS/PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting with either a Goα or Gβ common antisera. In its heterotrimeric form, immunoblotting with either antisera indicated that G-protein did not effectively interact with the i3 peptide resin (Fig. 1 A). However, following activation and subunit dissociation, Gβγ, but not Goα, bound to the i3 peptides (Fig. 1 A). Similar experiments with transducin resulted in undetectable Gβγ binding to the M2- or M3-MR i3 peptide (Fig. 1 A) consistent with the distinct functional properties of transducin and brain G-protein (∼80% of which is Go) (23Hildebrandt J.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the i3 loop presents a motif for brain Gβγ binding and that the Gβγ domain recognized by this motif is masked by the Gα subunit. The interaction of the i3 peptides with Gβγ was also observed using purified bovine brain Gβγ that was physically separated from brain Gα (Fig. 1, B and C). Purified Gβγ did not bind to GST control, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1C (PTP1C), Na+/H+ exchanger or c-Jun fusion proteins (Fig. 1 B) and also did not interact with the M3-MR i1, M3-MR i2, or M3-MR carboxyl terminus peptides (Fig. 1 C). Although the M3-MR i3 peptide interacted with brain Gβγ, it did not recognize transducin βγ (Fig. 1 C). As brain Gβγ and transducin βγ differ in their γ subunits (23Hildebrandt J.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), these data indicate that the γ subunit plays an important role in the recognition of Gβγ by the receptor subdomain. To provide additional insight as to the relative properties of Gβγ binding to the i3 peptides, the M3-MR i3 was compared with Gβγ binding domains of the proteins, GRK2 and Btk. GRK2 phosphorylates selected G-protein-coupled receptors following their activation by agonist, whereas Btk is a tyrosine kinase involved in human X chromosome-linked immunodeficiency. The binding of Gβγ to the M3-MR i3, GRK2-ct, and Btk-PH was dependent upon Gβγ concentration and exhibited similar affinities although maximum binding varied (Fig. 2). The direct association of Gβγ with the receptor subdomain may relate to earlier reports indicating that Gβγ plays diverse roles in signaling by G-protein-coupled receptors (23Hildebrandt J.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 452-460PubMed Google Scholar, 25Phillips W.J. Wong S.C.

Gβγ is postulated to mediate translocation of GRK2 from the cytosol to the membrane leading to phosphorylation of activated adrenergic, muscarinic, neurokinin, and other receptors of this structural class. Mechanistic aspects of this translocation are unclear. Gβγ may increase the amount of membrane-associated GRK2 by using the acylated γ subunit of Gβγ to anchor to hydrophobic sites in the membrane bilayer. A second possibility is that the binding of Gβγ to GRK2 initiates a conformational change in the enzyme that reveals a “membrane binding domain” of GRK2. Another possibility is that Gβγ may provide an anchor to the membrane by interacting with the i3 loop of the activated receptor. In such a situation, the kinase would be positioned adjacent to its substrate suggesting that one role of Gβγ is to “position” enzyme and substrate facilitating the phosphorylation reaction. If such a hypothesis is true, then Gβγ should promote the formation of a ternary complex consisting of the activated receptor, Gβγ, and GRK2. We addressed these issues experimentally using the M3-MR i3 peptide. We first determined if the M3-MR i3 peptide was a suitable substrate for phosphorylation by GRK2 and if so, how this phosphorylation compared with that observed with the intact agonist-activated receptor itself. As is the case for the intact M2-MR, M3-MR, and β2-AR, phosphorylation of the M3-MR i3 peptide required both Gβγ and the acidic lipid PI when assayed under ionic conditions similar to cytosol (Fig. 3 A). Gβγ and PI stimulated phosphorylation of the i3 peptide in a synergistic manner (Fig. 3 A). The M3-MR i3 peptide was phosphorylated by GRK2 to a stoichiometry of ∼1–3 mol of phosphate/mol of peptide, which is comparable to the results obtained with the intact, agonist-activated M2-MR, M3-MR, and β2-AR. The ability of Gβγ to stimulate GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the M3-MR i3 peptide was concentration-dependent, and it was blocked by the AC2Q peptide, a 27-residue peptide derived from adenylyl cyclase type II that blocks Gβγ regulation of various effector proteins (Fig. 3, B and C) (29Chen J.

Science. 1995; 268: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The interaction of Gβγ with the M3-MR i3 peptide described earlier was also blocked by the AC2Q peptide (data not shown). As observed for the intact agonist-activated β2-AR, M2-MR, and M3-MR (9DebBurman S.K. Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 224-233PubMed Google Scholar, 21Benovic J.L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15412-15418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of the M3-MR i3 peptide was sensitive to increased ionic strength of the incubation buffer (Fig. 4 A), and this apparently reflects the loss of a direct interaction between GRK2 and the i3 peptide (Fig. 4 B, upper panel). Addition of Gβγ to the incubation buffer reversed the inhibition of M3-MR i3 peptide phosphorylation by increased salt concentrations, suggesting that Gβγ facilitated the interaction of GRK2 with its substrate. The interaction of Gβγ with the M3-MR i3 peptide was actually augmented by increasing the concentration of KCl or NaCl (Fig. 4 B, lower panel), an effect that was directly opposite to the influence of increased ionic strength on i3 peptide/receptor phosphorylation and the association of GRK2 with the M3-MR i3 peptide (Fig. 4,A and B, upper panel). Thus, under ionic conditions similar to those found in cytosol, GRK2 did not effectively phosphorylate the intact agonist-activated receptor or the i3 peptide unless Gβγ was present. Indeed, addition of Gβγ resulted in the association of GRK2 with the M3-MR i3 peptide affinity matrix in the presence of cytosolic concentrations of potassium (Fig. 4 C). This association is likely mediated by a ternary complex consisting of the receptor subdomain, Gβγ, and GRK2. These data indicate that Gβγ served as a docking protein to allow formation of this ternary complex, which is apparently required for effective phosphorylation by GRK2. There are three important points concerning the interaction of Gβγ with the M3-MR i3 peptide. First, the interaction of the M3-MR i3 peptide with Gβγ requires dissociation of heterotrimeric G-protein. Second, the inability of the M3-MR i3 peptide to recognize transducin βγ indicates that the interaction with Gβγ is isoform-selective. Third, it is hypothesized that when the M3-MR i3 peptide is expressed free of the conformational constraints imposed by the receptor's membrane spans, it assumes an activated conformation (see “Discussion” in Ref. 1Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by structural analysis of the cytoplasmic domains of rhodopsin where key atomic distances were identical with those observed by chemical cross-linking of the intact activated receptor (30Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9649-9654Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12470-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Such an interpretation is also supported by the interaction of arrestin with the i3 loop of the M2-MR, M3-MR, and α2-AR (1Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and the ability of GRK2 to phosphorylate the M3-MR i3 peptide in a manner similar to that observed with intact, agonist-activated G-protein-coupled receptors. The dependence of Gβγ binding to the i3 peptide upon G-protein dissociation is of particular note relative to both potential downstream signaling events and various aspects of receptor regulation. Upon receptor activation, Gβγ may be “trapped” by the M3-MR i3 loop and present a motif that is recognized by GRK2 positioning the kinase in close proximity to its substrate, the activated receptor. Although such a scenario may not be operative for all GRKs or G-protein-coupled receptors, it is of particular interest for several reasons. Gβγ is suggested to interact with several molecules involved in signal propagation. The regulation of structurally diverse molecules by Gβγ suggests that its structure has unique properties that perhaps facilitate simultaneous interaction with more than one protein. These structural properties might reside in the repetitive elements of the WD-40 motifs and would be conducive to the function of Gβγ as an adaptor protein. The apparent ability of Gβγ to act as a docking protein suggests that Gβγ may anchor the formation of a signal transduction complex. Such an anchor may also allow the interface of selected G-protein-coupled receptors to signaling pathways involving soluble tyrosine kinases and/or low molecular weight G-proteins leading to activation of mitogenic signaling pathways and/or changes in cellular architecture.

https://openalex.org/W2121596604,"Several ω and in-chain fatty acid hydroxylases have been characterized in higher plants. In microsomes fromHelianthus tuberosus tuber the ω-2, ω-3, and ω-4 hydroxylation of lauric acid is catalyzed by one or a few closely related aminopyrine- and MnCl2-inducible cytochrome P450(s). To isolate the cDNA and determine the sequences of the(se) enzyme(s), we used antibodies directed against a P450-enriched fraction purified from Mn2+-induced tissues. Screening of a cDNA expression library from aminopyrine-treated tubers led to the identification of a cDNA (CYP81B1) corresponding to a transcript induced by aminopyrine. CYP81B1 was expressed in yeast. A systematic exploration of its function revealed that it specifically catalyzes the hydroxylation of medium chain saturated fatty acids, capric (C10:0), lauric (C12:0), and myristic (C14:0) acids. The same metabolites were obtained with transgenic yeast and plant microsomes, a mixture of ω-1 to ω-5 monohydroxylated products. The three fatty acids were metabolized with high and similar efficiencies, the major position of attack depending on chain length. When lauric acid was the substrate, turnover was 30.7 ± 1.4 min−1 and Km(app) 788 ± 400 nm. No metabolism of long chain fatty acids, aromatic molecules, or herbicides was detected. This new fatty acid hydroxylase is typical from higher plants and differs from those already isolated from other living organisms.

This new fatty acid hydroxylase is typical from higher plants and differs from those already isolated from other living organisms. Engineering of lipid metabolism in oilseed crops has become one of the major objectives of plant biotechnology (1Ohlrogge J.B.

Manipulation of fatty acid biosynthesis in transgenic plants offers a possibility for the improvement of the nutritional quality of vegetable oils, but also for redirecting plant metabolism toward production of renewable chemical feedstocks for industrial applications and replacement of petroleum-derived products. Alterations in fatty acid chain length, number, and position of double bonds have already been achieved. Next, valuable modifications will be achieved via introduction of functional groups to confer additional industrial commodities, such as increased or decreased solubility or fluidity, improved solvation of drugs or pesticides, presence of targets for chemical modifications, or synthesis of polymers. Among potential high value metabolites are the oxygenated (hydroxylated and epoxidized) products (5Perdue R.E. Agric. Eng. 1989; 70: 11-13Google Scholar, 6Van der Leij F.R. Witholt B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1995; 41: 222-238Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Plants are able to synthetize a whole range of oxygenated fatty acids (7van de Loo F.J. Fox B.G. Sommerville C. Moore T.S. Lipid Metabolism in Plants. CRC, Boca Raton, FL1993: 91-126Google Scholar). Some of them are major seed storage lipids in particular species. For example, castor bean endosperm produces a seed oil containing up to 90% ricinoleic acid (12R-hydroxyoctadec-cis-9-enoic acid). Other hydroxylated and epoxidized fatty acids constitute the building units of cutin and suberin, biopolymers that form the outer protective layers of all plant species (8Kolattukudy P.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1981; 32: 127-138Crossref Google Scholar). Different types of oxygenated derivatives are also released after mechanical stress or pathogen attack. Some of them play an important role in the signaling pathways and act as triggers of plant defense and plant development (9Farmer E.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1423-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Schweizer P. Felix G. Buchala A. Müller C. Métraux J.P. Plant J. 1996; 10: 331-341Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Others have been reported to have direct antimicrobial properties and to act as phytoalexins (11Kato T. Yamaguchi Y. Uyehara Y. Yokohama T. Namai T. Yamanaka S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1983; 24: 4715-4718Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Masui H. Kondo T. Kojima M. Phytochemistry. 1989; 28: 2613-2615Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Ohta H. Shida K.

Biochem. 1993; 57: 611-613Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Several classes of enzymes are involved in the formation of oxygenated fatty acid metabolites, lipoxygenases, epoxygenases, and desaturases, but the most versatile is the P450 superfamily of monooxygenases. Data obtained with plant microsomes indicate that several P450s catalyze fatty acid hydroxylation or epoxydation with high regio- and stereospecificities (15Salaün J.P. Helvig C. Drug Metab. Drug Interact. 1995; 12: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Attack of medium chain fatty acids, capric (C10:0), lauric (C12:0), and myristic acids (C14:0), by P450 enzymes occurs at different positions, depending on plant species. Pea and other Leguminosae produce almost exclusively ω-hydroxylated compounds (16Benveniste I. Salaün J.P. Simon A. Reichhart D. Durst F. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 122-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Salaün J.P. Benveniste I. Fonne R. Gabriac B. Reichhart D. Simon A. Durst F. Physiol. Veg. 1982; 20: 613-621Google Scholar). Such ω-hydroxylases are strongly and specifically induced by clofibrate and other peroxisome proliferation-inducing agents (18Salaün J.P. Simon A. Durst F. Lipids. 1986; 21: 776-779Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In other plant species, attack of medium fatty acids occurs in the chain. Microsomes from grass crops such as wheat and rice generate principally ω-1 and ω-2 hydroxylated metabolites (19Zimmerlin A. Salaün J.P. Durst F. Mioskowski C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Lauric acid hydroxylation in wheat is induced in an additive manner by phenobarbital and the herbicide safener naphthalic anhydride, an inducer of detoxifying enzymes used for selective protection of crops against herbicide damage (20Zimmerlin A. Durst F. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A second type of in-chain metabolism was first described in Helianthus tuberosus tuber (21Salaün J.P. Benveniste I. Reichhart D. Durst F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Salaün J.P. Benveniste I. Reichhart D. Durst F. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but is also observed in several monocots like maize, tulip, or lily (17Salaün J.P. Benveniste I. Fonne R. Gabriac B. Reichhart D. Simon A. Durst F. Physiol. Veg. 1982; 20: 613-621Google Scholar). It results in the formation of ω-2, ω-3, and ω-4 monohydroxylated products. This type of fatty acid metabolism is strongly induced in response to MnCl2, aminopyrine, and phenobarbital treatments of plant tissues (17Salaün J.P. Benveniste I. Fonne R. Gabriac B. Reichhart D. Simon A. Durst F. Physiol. Veg. 1982; 20: 613-621Google Scholar, 22Salaün J.P. Benveniste I. Reichhart D. Durst F. Eur. J.

Parallel induction and inhibition suggest that a single P450 catalyzes the ω-2, ω-3, and ω-4 hydroxylations. High regioselectivity of attack of unsaturated analogues, on the other hand, would rather be indicative of the involvement of several and probably closely related enzymes (23Salaün J.P. Weissbart D. Helvig C. Durst F. Pflieger P. Bosch H. Mioskowski C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar,25Salaün J.P. Weissbart D. Durst F. Pflieger P. Mioskowski C.

A new strategy, based on the inducibility of such fatty acid in-chain fatty acid hydroxylases by multiple xenobiotics, has been devised to isolate their coding sequence(s) and to answer the question of their substrate and regiospecificities. We partially purified P450 proteins from MnCl2-induced H. tuberosus tuber tissues (27Batard Y. Zimmerlin A. Le Ret M. Durst F. Werck-Reichhart D. Plant Cell Environ. 1995; 18: 523-533Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised against the partially purified protein fraction and used to screen a cDNA library from aminopyrine-treated tuber. This study reports the isolation of a cDNA corresponding to aminopyrine-induced transcript coding for a new P450 and the functional characterization of this P450 after expression in yeast. The protein is shown to catalyze the in-chain monohydroxylations of medium C10:0, C12:0, and C14:0 saturated fatty acids. A single P450 accounts for the formation of the different products found in plant microsomes. This new type of fatty acid hydroxylase has never been isolated from other living organisms. Aminopyrine was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Benzoic acid, salicylic acid, coumarin, and 7-ethoxycoumarin were from Sigma (St. Quentin-Fallavier, France).

[phenyl-U-14C]Chlortoluron, [phenyl-U-14C]isoproturon, and [triazine-U-14C]simazine were generous gifts from Novartis (Basel, Swizerland). [phenyl-U-14C]-2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid was purchased from Sigma. Jerusalem artichoke (H. tuberosusL. var. Blanc commun) tubers were grown in open field, harvested in November, and stored in plastic bags at 4 °C in the dark. For aging experiments, tubers were sliced (1.5 mm thick), washed, and aged for 48 h in aerated (4 liters·min−1) distilled water containing 20 mm of aminopyrine, 8 mm sodium phenobarbital, or 25 mm MnCl2. The MnCl2 solution was adjusted to pH 7. Total RNA were isolated as described by Lesot et al. (28Lesot A. Benveniste I. Hasenfratz M.P. Durst F. Plant Cell Physiol. 1990; 31: 1177-1182Google Scholar). Denatured RNA was separated in the presence of formaldehyde through a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. RNA blots prehybridization and hybridization with a probe, radiolabeled with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP by random priming, were carried out at 65 °C according to established procedures (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Membranes were washed twice for 10 min with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and once for 10 min with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, then twice for 30 min with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. The hybridization signal was recorded by autoradiography. RNA amounts were standardized by hybridization at 55 °C to a 300-bp Capsicum annuum 25 S rRNA probe. Poly(A)+ RNAs were prepared from H. tuberosus tuber tissues sliced and aged 24 h in the presence of 20 mm aminopyrine (28Lesot A. Benveniste I. Hasenfratz M.P. Durst F. Plant Cell Physiol. 1990; 31: 1177-1182Google Scholar). A cDNA library was constructed in the vector λ-ZAPII (Stratagene), starting from 5 μg of polyadenylated RNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 2 × 105plaque-forming units were screened with antibodies raised against a P450-enriched fraction purified from MnCl2-induced tuber tissues (27Batard Y. Zimmerlin A. Le Ret M. Durst F. Werck-Reichhart D. Plant Cell Environ. 1995; 18: 523-533Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), using alcaline phosphatase detection. Fifty-six positive clones were isolated. They were tested for the presence of a P450 consensus sequence using the PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). approach previously described by Meijer et al. (30Meijer A.H. Souer E. Verpoorte R. Hoge J.H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PCR-amplified DNA fragments were obtained from 15 clones. They were reamplified, radiolabeled, and hybridized with total RNA from dormant, wounded, and aminopyrine-treated tissues. Four of them (1D, 12B, 13B, and 13C) hybridized to transcripts of the expected size (1.6–2.3 kb). The corresponding clones were purified by low density screening, before rescuing pBluescript phagemids. Sequencing of the inserts showed that only 1D coded for a P450 missing about 510–540 nucleotides at the 5′-end. Rescreening of the library (6.105 plaque-forming units) with the radiolabeled 1D probe was performed at high stringency (65 °C) according to established procedures (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Membranes were washed twice for 10 min with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and once for 10 min with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, then once for 30 min with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Hybridization signal was recorded by autoradiography. The inserts of 216 positive plaques were PCR-analyzed for size and hybridization. Ten clones were selected and rescreened under the same conditions before rescuing pBluescript phagemids and sequencing the inserts. Comparison of the longest insert (1DN) with P450 sequences available in data banks indicated that it was still missing 10–20 coding nucleotides. The missing nucleotides were obtained using the 5′-RACE system from Life Technologies, Inc., according to manufacturer's instructions, and using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from H. tuberosus tubers treated with 20 mm aminopyrine. Amplified cDNA was cloned in a pGEM-T vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and eight bacterial colonies were analyzed for the presence of the missing fragment. Two putative 5′-end sequences were thus identified. Both DNA fragments were ligated to the partial 1DN using a unique Tth111 site present in the overlapping sequence to reconstitute full-length cDNAs. BamHI and EcoRI sites were introduced by PCR just upstream of the ATG and downstream of the stop codon of the full-length coding sequences, respectively, using the primers 5′-ATATATGGATCCATGGAGATCCCATATCTACTCACC (sense) and 5′-TATATAGAATTCGACTCACAGTTCGGACAGTAGATTCGTCATC (reverse). The PCR mixture was preheated for 2 min at 92 °C before addition of 1 unit of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). After 3 min of additional heating at 92 °C, 30 cycles of amplification were carried out as follows: 1-min denaturation at 92 °C, 1-min annealing at 52 °C, and 2-min extension at 72 °C. The reaction was completed by 10-min extension at 72 °C. AfterBamHI/EcoRI digestion, the 1515- and 1560-bp coding sequences were inserted into the vector pYeDP60 (31Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A.

A colony from a SGI plate was transferred into 50 ml of SGI medium and grown at 30 °C for 46 h. Cells were recovered by 10-min centrifugation at 8000 × g, washed with 25 ml of YPI medium, and resuspended in 225 ml of YPI. Galactose induction was carried out for 14–16 h with shaking at 160 rpm, until cell density reached 2.5 × 107 cells·ml−1. When indicated, 0.5 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid methyl ester (Sigma) was added to the induction medium. Cells were either used directly or stored at 4 °C for 24 h before preparation of the microsomes as described by Pierrel et al.(32Pierrel M.A. Batard Y. Kazmaier M. Mignotte-Vieux C. Durst F.

Fatty acid metabolism was assayed as in Pinot et al. (33Pinot F. Alayrac C. Mioskowski C. Durst F. Salaün J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Metabolites were resolved by thin layer chromatography (Silica Gel G60 F252, 0.25 mm, Merck) with a mixture of diethylether/light petroleum (boiling point, 40–60 °C)/formic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v) for C10 to C14 fatty acids, or a mixture of the same solvents (50:50:1) for long chain fatty acids. The areas corresponding to polar metabolites generated from each substrate were scrapped directly into counting vials or eluted with diethylether and subjected to reverse phase-HPLC analysis using a mixture of water/acetonitrile/acetic acid (25:75:0.2) and (45:55:0.2) as described previously (23Salaün J.P.

Radioactivity of reverse phase-HPLC effluents was monitored with a computerized on-line solid scintillation counter (Ramona-D RAYTEST, Germany). The fluorimetric assays for 7-alkoxycoumarins and 7- alkoxyresorufinsO-dealkylation were described in Werck-Reichhart et al. (34Werck-Reichhart D. Gabriac B. Teutsch H. Durst F. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Tests of diclofop, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, chlorsulfuron, and chlorotoluron metabolism were carried out as described by Zimmerlin et al. (19Zimmerlin A. Salaün J.P. Durst F. Mioskowski C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Tests of isoproturon and simazine metabolism were as for chlortoluron, except TLC solvents were hexane/chloroform/acetone/ethanol 8:8:4:1 (v/v/v/v) and dichlorometane/methanol/formic acid 90:10:3 (v/v/v), respectively. Assay of bentazon ring-hydroxylation was described in McFadden et al. (35McFadden J.J. Gronwald J.W. Eberlein C.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Teutsch H. Durst F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Protein was quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The data are means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Double-stranded pBluescript subclones were sequenced using the prism Ready Reaction dye deoxy terminator cycle method of Applied Biosystems Inc. The sequence data were analyzed using the GCG sequence analysis software package, version 8.1 (40Devereux J. Heaberlin P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). Sequences were aligned using ClustalW (41Thompson J.D. Higgins D.J. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 2: 4673-4680Crossref Scopus (55635) Google Scholar) to avoid insertion of gaps in hydrophobic helices. The alignment refined by hand and displayed using SeqVu 1.0.1. (Garvan Institute, Sydney). The tree was drawn using Treeview (42Page R.D.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). The oxygenated metabolites of fatty acids were purified by TLC, methylated with diazomethane, and silylated with a mixture of bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide + 1% trimethylchlorosilane and pyridine (1:1; v/v), before gas chromatography and electron impact (70 eV) ionization mass spectrometry. The analysis was monitored on a 1% SE30 capillary column (30 m × 0.025 mm) programmed to rise from 100 to 280 °C at 6 °C·min−1, coupled to a LKB 900S mass spectrometer with an LKB 2130 computer on line. We previously raised antibodies against a P450-enriched fraction partially purified from MnCl2-induced H. tuberosus tuber tissues (27Batard Y. Zimmerlin A. Le Ret M. Durst F. Werck-Reichhart D. Plant Cell Environ. 1995; 18: 523-533Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These antibodies inhibited lauric acid in-chain hydroxylation by about 30%. They were used to screen a cDNA library prepared from tuber tissues treated for 24 h with aminopyrine to induce fatty acid hydroxylase activity. Fifty-six positive clones were isolated and tested for the presence of a P450 consensus sequence using the PCR technique previously described by Meijer et al. (30Meijer A.H. Souer E. Verpoorte R. Hoge J.H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PCR fragments of expected size were obtained from 15 clones, labeled, and hybridized with total RNA prepared from dormant, wounded, or aminopyrine-treated tuber tissues. One of the 15 clones corresponded to a transcript of approximately 1.7 kb, which was undetectable in dormant tuber, became detectable in wounded tissues, and clearly accumulated following treatment with aminopyrine, MnCl2, or phenobarbital (Fig. 1). Sequencing of its insert showed that it coded for a typical P450 missing about 500 nucleotides encoding the N terminus. Rescreening of the library with this insert as a probe led to obtaining the 1DN cDNA still lacking a start codon (Fig. 2), but missing less than 50 nucleotides according to alignment with sequences available in data bases. When submitted to the P450 nomenclature committee (c/o Dr. D. R. Nelson, University of Tennessee, Memphis), the polypeptide encoded by 1DN was assigned to a new P450 subfamily and named CYP81B1.Figure 2The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the H. tuberosus CYP81B1 cDNAs. The upstream vertical arrow shows the 5′-end of the 1DN clone. The horizontal arrow delineates the primer used for the 5′-RACE experiment. The two 5′-segments amplified are shown paired and aligned. Differences in amino acids are shaded. The Tth111 site used for the construction of the full-length s and l cDNAs is indicated by a double arrow. The amino acid sequences corresponding to the conserved I helix and heme-binding regions areunderlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Unexpectedly, the 5′-RACE experiment performed to obtain the missing nucleotides led to the isolation of two cDNA fragments: “s” (376 bp) and “l” (421 bp), both with an ATG start codon preceded by the same 5′-noncoding sequence. s differed from l by two insertions of 14 and 1 amino acids only present in l, two nonconservative amino acid changes, and two silent nucleotide modifications (Fig. 2). It seems unlikely that such a difference could result from a PCR artifact. The N terminus forms the major membrane anchoring segment of P450 proteins. Different membrane anchors may thus reflect different subcellular localizations of two closely related proteins. Comparison of s and 1DN showed that they were identical in their overlaping sequence, and that 1DN was missing only 5 bp from the full-length coding sequence. Two full-length coding sequences were reconstituted from 1DN and s or l, to obtainCYP81B1s (1518 bp; EMBL accession no. AJ000477) and CYP81B1l (1563 bp; EMBL accession no. AJ000478) coding for 505 and 520 amino acids, respectively. the CYP81B1s cDNA encodes a protein of predictedMr 57,060 with a pI of 7.86. In the case of the CYP81B1l construction, the Mr is shifted to 58,877 and the pI to 8.06. In addition to typicalMr and pI, CYP81B1 displays all the signatures of P450 proteins. The PFG(ASV)GRRXC(PAV)G sequence, characteristic of plant P450s from the group A (as defined by Durst and Nelson (43Durst F. Nelson D.R. Drug Metab. Drug Interact. 1995; 12: 189-206PubMed Google Scholar)) and involved in heme binding, is found as expected near the C terminus (Fig. 2). The consensus (AG)GX(DE)T(TS), typical of the I helix that participates in oxygen binding and charge transfer in the active site, is also present at the expected location. The N-terminal segment of CYP81B1 is somewhat unusual due to a high content in hydroxylated residues (S and T) and to repetitive alternation of such residues with stretches of hydrophobic amino acids, in particular in CYP81B1l. It can be speculated that the unusual structure of this membrane anchoring segment is related to some particular location of the protein in a specialized cellular compartment or membrane domain. The cluster of basic residues acting as halt-transfer signal and the proline-rich hinge region expected in endoplasmic reticulum bound P450s are present in CYP81B1. That CYP81B1 belongs to the A group of typical plant P450s is confirmed by the comparison of its overall amino acid sequence with proteins of other organisms. CYP81B1 belongs to the same family as CYP81A2 (44% amino acid identity) and show high local identities to the C-terminal region of the partial CYP81A1, A3, and A4 (46–56% overall identity) isolated from maize (44Potter S. Moreland D.E. Kreuz K. Ward E. Drug Metab. Drug Interact. 1995; 12: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The other most closely related proteins all belong to the group A of plant P450s, CYP82A1 from pea (40% identity), CYP92A2 from Nicotiana tabacum (38% identity), CYP71A1 from avocado (37% identity), and CYP93A1 from soybean (36% identity). The function of all these related enzymes is still unknown. CYP81B1 has only a 34% amino acid identity with the xenobiotic metabolizing CYP76B1 and 29% identity with the cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (CYP73A1) previously isolated from H. tuberosus (45Batard Y.

https://openalex.org/W2060484473,"PAX6 is a transcription activator that regulates eye development in animals ranging from Drosophila to human. The C-terminal region of PAX6 isproline/serine/threonine-rich (PST) and functions as a potent transactivation domain when attached to a heterologous DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor, GAL4. The PST region comprises 152 amino acids encoded by four exons. The transactivation function of the PST region has not been defined and characterized in detail by in vitro mutagenesis. We dissected the PST domain in two independent systems, a heterologous system using a GAL4 DNA-binding site and the native system of PAX6. Our data consistently showed that in both systems all four constituent exons of the PST domain are responsible for the transactivation function. The four exon fragments act synergistically to stimulate transcription, although none of them can function individually as an independent transactivation domain. Combinations of two or more exon fragments can reconstitute substantial transactivation activity when fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, but they surprisingly do not produce much activity in the context of native PAX6, although the mutant PAX6 proteins are stable and their DNA-binding function remains unaffected. Our data suggest that these mutants may antagonize the wild-type PAX6 activity by competing for target DNA-binding sites. We conclude that the PAX6 protein contains an unusually large transactivation domain that is evolutionarily conserved to a high degree and that its full transactivation activity relies on the synergistic action of the four exon fragments.

Twelve mutations have been detected in the PST region of PAX6. 2Summarized on the World Wide Web at http://craigellachie. hgu.mrc.ac.uk/Softdata/PAX6/. Two of them are simple nonsense mutations that result in mutant PAX6 with residual PST domains, and the other 10 are splicing mutations that result in truncation of the PST domain and fusion to a nonsense peptide. Residual PST domains can constitute substantial transactivation function when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (29Glaser T. Jepeal L. Edwards J.G. Young S.R. Favor J. Maas R.L. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), which has led to the prediction that PAX6 mutants with truncated PST domains may retain partial transactivation function. However, the functions of these residual PST domains are unclear in the context of native PAX6. In this paper, we report a detailed dissection of the PST region of PAX6 in two independent systems, a heterologous system (GAL4) and a native system (PAX6). We found that the transactivation function of the PST domain is dispersed into the four constituent exons (exons 10–13). The four exon fragments act synergistically to stimulate transcription, but none of them can function individually as an independent transactivation domain. Although residual PST domains can reconstitute substantial transactivation activity when fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, they surprisingly do not produce as much activity in the context of native PAX6, although the mutant PAX6 proteins are stable and retain their DNA binding function intact. Our data suggest that these mutants may antagonize the wild-type PAX6 activity by competing for target DNA-binding sites.

Endonuclease digestion with SpeI and XbaI generated compatible cohesive ends. the HindIII–SpeI-digested PCR products were ligated into the HindIII–XbaI restriction sites in the polylinker region of the expression vector pRc-CMV (Invitrogen).Table IIOligonucleotides used for PCR cloning of Rc-CMV-PAX6 constructs Open table in a new tab The PAX6-SacII construct used to make internal deletions by site-directed mutagenesis was created by recombinant PCR (40Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13540) Google Scholar). The 5′-primer contained a HindIII restriction site and a Kozak consensus sequence. The 3′-primer contained a stop codon followed by an XbaI restriction site. The two internal mutant primers contained a SacII restriction site designed to fit in-frame between aa 277 and 278 of PAX6. All of the internal deletion constructs were constructed using a common 3′-primer that contained an XbaI restriction site and a stop codon but different 5′-primers that all contained a SacII restriction site. The various SacII–XbaI endonuclease-digested PCR products were then inserted between the SacII and XbaI restriction sites of the PAX6-SacII construct to create various internal deletion mutants. The PAX6-(4V/G) construct was similarly created by recombinant PCR using primers designed to mutate Val401, Val403, Val405, and Val407 into glycines simultaneously. HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells were plated at a density of 4–6 × 105 cells/60-mm tissue culture dish 24–36 h prior to transfection. Transfections for all cells were carried out with plasmid DNA coated with the polycationic lipid lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HeLa cells were transfected at 50–70% confluence using 6 μl (12 μg) of lipofectamine/60-mm dish. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected at 60–80% confluence using 15 μl (30 μg) of lipofectamine/60-mm dish. HEB3 cells were transfected at 70–80% confluence using 6 μl (12 μg) of lipofectamine/60-mm dish. For the GAL4 fusion experiments, each dish was transfected with 0.8 μg of the reporter plasmid 4 × GAL4-fos-CAT, 0.025–0.4 μg of GAL4 effector plasmid, 0.8 μg of the internal control plasmid pSV2 β-galactosidase (Promega), and pBluescript carrier plasmid (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) to bring the total amount of plasmids to 3.2 μg. For transfections with the pRc-CMV-PAX6 expression vectors, each dish was transfected with 2 μg of reporter plasmid P6CON-CAT (41Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T. Jepeal L. Maas R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8355-8361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or CD19–2-(A-ins)-luciferase (21Czerny T. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2858-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), 1 μg of pRc-CMV effector plasmid, and 0.4 μg of pSV2 β-galactosidase (Promega) as internal control. Cell extracts were prepared after 24–72 h of transfection. The cells on each 60-mm culture dish were rinsed twice with ice cold 1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, detached using a rubber policeman into 160 μl of ice-cold 0.25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and then transferred into a microcentrifuge tube. The cells were then lysed by three cycles of freezing in dry ice and ethanol and thawing at 37 °C. The microcentrifuge tube was then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at full speed for 5 min at 4 °C, after which the supernatant was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and used immediately or stored at −70 °C for future use. The cell extracts were first assayed for β-galactosidase activity and then normalized by dilution with 0.25 mm Tris, pH 7.8. CAT assays were performed according to standard procedures (55Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and extracts were diluted as necessary to keep the assay in the linear range. The percentage of acetylation of [14C]chloramphenicol was quantitated directly from thin layer chromatography plates using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cell extracts were prepared after 24–48 h of transfection. The cells on each 60-mm tissue culture dish were rinsed twice with 3 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at room temperature in 250 μl of lysis solution (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol added fresh prior to use). The cell lysates were detached from the culture plate using a rubber policeman or cell scraper, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuged for 2 min to pellet any debris. Supernatant was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube. Cell extracts were then used immediately for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays or frozen at −70 °C for future use. Luciferase activity was measured at room temperature using a luciferase assay kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA; catalog number BC100L). All reagents and cell extracts were warmed to room temperature before use. Briefly, 50 μl of substrate A was aliquoted into 75 × 12-mm luminometer sample tubes (Sarstedt; catalog number 55.476). Then 10 μl of individual cell extracts and 50 μl of substrate B were added sequentially into the tube, which was then placed immediately into a luminometer for measurement. The luminometer was set to measure the luciferase signal for 10 s with a 2-s delay. β-Galactosidase activity was detected using a Galacto-Light Plus chemiluminescent assay kit (Tropix; catalog number BL100G). All reagents and cell extracts were warmed to room temperature before use. Briefly, 200 μl of reaction buffer containing Galacton-Plus substrate was dispensed into 75 × 12-mm luminometer sample tubes. Then, 5 μl of individual cell extracts was added to the tube, which was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Then, 300 μl of Accelerator reagent was added to each tube, which was immediately placed in a luminometer for measurement. The measurement protocol was the same as for the luciferase assay. Luciferase activities were normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity. Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected HeLa or NIH 3T3 cells according to the method of Schreiber et al. (42Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3921) Google Scholar), as modified by Singh and Aggarwal (43Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested from each 60-mm culture dish and lysed in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.0 mg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 mg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine). The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.0 mg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 mg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine). The protein concentration of each nuclear extract was measured by Bradford assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed in a 20-μl binding reaction incubated at room temperature for 30 min in a binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl) (43Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Each binding reaction contained 0.5 μg of nuclear extracts, 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 16 fmol of probes labeled with 32P. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4.5% native polyacrylamide gel using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, pH 8.5, and 1 mm EDTA (43Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). The gel was analyzed by a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). For supershift assays, the binding reaction mixture was incubated with the polyclonal antibody against PAX6-(16–422) for 30 min at room temperature before loading onto the gel. The nuclear extracts prepared from transfected HeLa, NIH 3T3, or HEB3 cells were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then analyzed for PAX6 expression by hybridization with polyclonal antibodies raised against the paired domain (PD) of PAX6 (aa 1–127) (44Carriere C. Plaza S. Martin P. Quatannens B. Bailly M. Stehelin D. Saule S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7257-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The protein band was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (ECL kit, Pharmacia Amersham Biotech). The bands on the Western blots were quantitated using Personal Densitometer Scan version 1.30 and ImageQuant Version 3.3 software (Molecular Dynamics). The identification and characterization of functional protein domains are critical to understanding the molecular role of PAX6. We (28Tang K. Saunders G.F. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1994; 8A: 203Google Scholar) and others (21Czerny T. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2858-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 29Glaser T. Jepeal L. Edwards J.G. Young S.R. Favor J. Maas R.L. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) have demonstrated previously that the PST region of PAX6 can confer a potent transactivation function when fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription activator GAL4-(1–97). To examine the functional relationship of the PST region with other domains, we fused full-length PAX6 to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 and tested its ability to activate transcription from a promoter bearing GAL4 binding sites. The reporter plasmid, 4 × GAL4-fos-CAT, contains four GAL4 binding sites inserted upstream of the c-fos TATA box linked to the CAT gene. Cotransfection of the effector plasmid and the reporter plasmid into HeLa cells revealed that the full-length PAX6 fused with GAL4 did not show transcriptional activation (Fig. 1 A), whereas deletion of the PD resulted in an efficient transcriptional activation of the CAT gene. This suggests that the presence of the PD could either interfere with the DNA binding of GAL4 or conformationally interfere with the interaction between the PST domain and the general transcriptional machinery. Further deletion of the linker region (G) caused a reduction in transactivation. This reduction was likely due to the negative effects of the homeodomain (HD), which became stronger after removal of the G region or when the HD was placed in proximity to GAL4. Although the function of the G region is unknown, it is not directly involved in transactivation, since this region had no activity when tested either alone or in association with the PD or HD. Finally, deletion of the entire PD-G-HD region showed that the C-terminal 152-aa PST region produced the highest activation (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, removal of the PST region resulted in the complete loss of transactivation in all C-terminal deletion mutants. These results demonstrate that the transactivation function of PAX6 resides in the C-terminal PST region, which can function independently of the other regions of PAX6 when fused with an appropriate DNA-binding domain. They also show that PD and the HD have negative effects on the transactivation function of the GAL4-PAX6 fusion protein. Similar negative effects of PD and HD have been observed with the GAL4-Pax3 fusion protein (31Chalepakis G. Jones F.S. Edelman G.M. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12745-12749Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To dissect the transactivation domain, we divided the PST region at the exon boundaries into four fragments: E10 (composed of 35 aa), E11 (39 aa), E12 (50 aa), and E13 (28 aa). These four exons were fused individually to GAL4-(1–97) and tested for their ability to transactivate the reporter gene 4 × GAL4-fos-CAT in HeLa cells (Fig. 2 B). None of the four exon fragments caused significant activation, indicating disruption of the transactivation domain. To verify the protein expression of the transfected GAL4 fusion constructs, we performed Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells transfected under the same experimental conditions as used for CAT assays. The GAL4 fusion proteins of the expected sizes were detected in the nuclear extracts by an immune serum raised against the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4-DBD) (data not shown). We next tested combinations of adjacent exons: E10 and E11 of 74 amino acids, E11 and E12 of 89 amino acids, and E12 and E13 of 78 amino acids. All three combinations resulted in synergistic activation at similar levels, albeit with more activity shifted to the C-terminal exons. Further combination of three exons, E10, E11, and E12, produced higher activity than combination of two exons. Protein expression of transfected constructs was verified by Western blot using the polyclonal antibody against the GAL4-DBD (data not shown). Some of the GAL4 fusion constructs, e.g. G4-E12+13 and G4-E12, gave variable expression in different experiments. These experiments were repeated several times, and the transactivation data shown represent the activity of similar levels of protein. If we assume that combination of E10 and E11 reconstituted a relatively weak transactivation domain and that combination of E12 and E13 reconstituted a relatively strong transactivation domain, then combination of the two disrupted activation domains, E11 and E12, would not have reconstituted a third domain. Thus, the full activity of transactivation was dispersed among the four exon fragments. These data demonstrate that the integrity of the PST region is crucial for a high level of activation. A minimal deletion in the C-terminal exon (E13) can result in a 50% reduction in transactivation, which may be sufficient to cause aniridia. The residual PST domains retain substantial transactivation function and thereby may cause a relatively mild phenotype (29Glaser T. Jepeal L. Edwards J.G. Young S.R. Favor J. Maas R.L. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), although there was no prior evidence that the truncated PAX6 proteins would be stable in the context of the native PAX6 protein. To test the hypothesis that the PST domain activated transcription by protein-protein interactions with coactivators, we tested whether a PST pep"

Calcium-linked cellular functions in excitable tissues are mediated by voltage-dependent calcium channels, which participate in the regulation of action potential generation, muscle contraction, and secretion of hormones or neurotransmitters (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Although in neurons multiple types of calcium channels, which can be distinguished by their pharmacological properties, are expressed, in skeletal and cardiac muscles the principal calcium channels arel-type (1Catterall W.A.

Cytosolic calcium rise is an important signal also in nonexcitable cells, including immune cells, regulating fundamental processes such as activation, growth, and differentiation (5Gardner P.

Increase in free intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) may result from calcium mobilization from either intracellular stores or extracellular medium or both (5Gardner P. Cell. 1989; 59: 15-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Unlike the mechanisms mediating mobilization from intracellular stores, the molecular structures mediating extracellular calcium influxes are still poorly characterized. Recently, the presence of functional calcium channels displaying DHP sensitivity has been observed in B lymphocytes (8Sadighi Akcha A.A. Willmott N.J. Brickley K. Dolphin A.C. Galione A. Hunt S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7297-7300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that similar structures are present also in nonexcitable cells. We have previously shown that some functions of dendritic cells (DC) are mediated by [Ca2+]iincrease. DC are professional antigen presenting cells able to endocytose and process soluble or particulated antigens (9Cella M. Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 10Rubartelli A. Poggi A. Zocchi M.R. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1997; 9: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Activated DC produce IL-12, a cytokine that amplifies the immune response promoting the differentiation of the T helper 1 lymphocyte subset, which in turn substains the natural killer (NK) cell activity (11Scott P. Science. 1993; 260: 496-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 12Lamont A.G. Adorini L. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 214-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We reported that activation of DC by cross-linking of the surface lectin NKRP1A with consequent IL-12 production is accompanied by extracellular calcium influx (13Poggi A. Rubartelli A. Moretta L. Zocchi M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2965-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); similarly, apoptotic body engulfment induces and is dependent on calcium entry in phagocytosing DC (10Rubartelli A. Poggi A. Zocchi M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the HIV-1 transactivating factor Tat, which can be released by infected cells and play a number of extracellular roles (14Ensoli B. Barillari G. Salahuddin S.Z. Gallo R.C.

AIDS. 1997; 11: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We thus investigated the presence of calcium channels on DC and the possible interference by exogenous Tat. Our data indicate that functional DHP-sensitivel-type calcium channels are expressed by DC and regulate both apoptotic body engulfment and NKRP1A-mediated IL-12 production. Interestingly, l-type calcium channels appear to be the molecular target of HIV-1 Tat on DC; indeed, binding of DHP derivatives to these channels is cross-inhibited by Tat. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of HIV-1 Tat on DC function is antagonized by the DHP agonist Bay K 8644 (2Glossmann H. Ferry D.R.

Media were shown to be endotoxin-free using the Limulus lysate colorimetric assay (Procedures and Biological Information International, Milan, Italy). The human Jurkat T cell line (clone JA3) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Apoptosis was induced by sublethal irradiation of JA3 cells (4000 radiation absorbed doses) and culture at 37 °C for 20 h. Engulfment assay was performed as described previously (10Rubartelli A.

Immunol. 1997; 27: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19Zocchi M.R. Poggi A. Rubartelli A. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Luciani M.F. Chimini G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In some experiments DC were pretreated for 20 min with different concentrations of Tat (from 100 to 1 nm) or with Tat 100 nm plus Bay K 8644 10 μm; in other experiments, Bay K 8644 10 μmwas added immediately prior apoptotic body challenge to untreated or Tat-pretreated cells. Drug concentrations were chosen on the basis of titration experiments (not shown). Single cell analysis of calcium fluxes was performed as described (10Rubartelli A. Poggi A. Zocchi M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19Zocchi M.R. Poggi A. Rubartelli A. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, DC cultured on round coverslips were loaded with 1 μm FURA 2-AM (1 h at 37 °C), placed in a micro-incubator (Medical System Corp., Greenvale, NY) on an inverted epi-fluorescence Axiovert 10 microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and maintained at 37 °C by a temperature controller (TC-202, Medical System). FURA 2 was excited with a high pressure 75 W xenon arc lamp fitted with appropriate filters on a shutter controlled by a Pentium 90 MHz computer. Excitation light was at 334 and 380 nm; emitted light was filtered at 510 nm. Two 334/380 ratio were taken each second, and video images were collected with an intensified charged coupled device (CCD) camera (ATTO Instruments, INC., Rockville, MD) and recorded every 15 s using the image processor program Attofluor RatioVision 6.08 (ATTO Instruments). Results were stored as a ratio of FURA 2 fluorescence at 334 nm divided by the fluorescence at 380 nm excitation. [Ca2+]i was calculated according to Grynkiewiczet al. (24Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i increases were measured upon apoptotic body interaction with DC or after DC treatment with either Bay K 8644 (10 μm) or ionomycin (1 μm). Alternatively, [Ca2+]i was measured after cross-linking of the NKRP1A molecule, obtained by incubation of DC with 5 μg/ml of the specific F(ab′)2 mAb (20 min at 4 °C) followed by 10 μg/ml of F(ab′)2 GAM added during the test at 37 °C as described (13Poggi A. Rubartelli A. Moretta L. Zocchi M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2965-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of CD31 or exposure of DC to GAM F(ab′)2 alone did not elicit [Ca2+]i increases (13Poggi A. Rubartelli A. Moretta L. Zocchi M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2965-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In some experiments, DC were pretreated with NFP (1 or 10 μm) or HIV-1 Tat (from 100 to 10 nm) for 20 min, before challenge with apoptotic bodies, Bay K 8644, ionomycin, or NKRP1A cross-linking. DC (106/sample), untreated or preincubated 20 min with HIV-1 Tat or with Bay K 8644 or with Fn-III as a control (from 0.1 to 1 μm), were stained with 3 nmDM-BODIPYR DHP (4Berger W. Prinz H. Striessnig J. Kang H.-C. Haugland R. Glossmann H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11875-11883Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and run on a FACSort (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). The concentrations of calcium channel antagonists reported to cross-inhibit the binding of 3 nmDM-BODIPYR DHP or other DHP derivatives range 10–500-fold (4Berger W. Prinz H. Striessnig J. Kang H.-C. Haugland R. Glossmann H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11875-11883Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Alternatively, DC untreated or pretreated for 20 min with HIV-1 Tat or with BayK 8644 or with Fn-III (from 1 to 10 μm) were stained with biotinylated HIV-1 Tat (20Morgavi P. Bonifaci N. Pagani M. Costigliolo S. Sitia R. Rubartelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11256-11260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) followed by phycoerythrin-streptavidin and analyzed by FACSort. Results are expressed as mean of fluorescence intensity (MFI). DC (2 × 106/sample), cultured in 1% Nutridoma (Boehringer Mannheim Italia, Monza, MI, Italy) untreated or treated for 20 min with NFP 10 μm or with different concentrations of Tat (from 100 to 1 nm) or with Tat 100 nm plus Bay K 8644 10 μm or with Bay K 8644 10 μm alone were challenged by cross-linking of the NKRP1A molecule with the F(ab′)2 of a specific monoclonal antibody followed by GAM F(ab′)2, as described (13Poggi A. Rubartelli A. Moretta L. Zocchi M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2965-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of CD31 or exposure of DC to GAM F(ab′)2 alone did not stimulate IL-12 production (13Poggi A. Rubartelli A. Moretta L. Zocchi M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2965-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Supernatants were collected after 3 h, and secreted IL-12 was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit for human IL-12 (p40 and p70) purchased from Endogen (Woburn, MA). After separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%) under reducing conditions, lysates from DC (50 μg of protein/sample; protein dosage performed with the Detergent-Compatible Bio-Rad kit based on the colorimetric Lowry method, Bio-Rad) or A431 cells (positive control, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Hybond ECL, Amersham Italia S.r.l., Milan, Italy) as described (13Poggi A. Rubartelli A. Moretta L. Zocchi M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2965-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Filters were blocked overnight with 10% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated 1 h with the anti-calcium channel β1 subunit mAb (clone 44, Transduction Laboratories), at 1:250 dilution, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated GAM Ig (DAKO S.p.A., Milan, Italy, 1:10,000 dilution). The immunoreactive bands were revealed by luminol reaction (ECL, Amersham). We have previously shown that apoptotic body engulfment by DC elicits [Ca2+]irises, mainly due to the entry of extracellular calcium, that are essential for phagocytosis (10Rubartelli A. Poggi A. Zocchi M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1893-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 19Zocchi M.R. Poggi A. Rubartelli A. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The possibility of an involvement of calcium channels in this process has been investigated by using the inhibitory DHP derivative NFP, which specifically binds to the α1C subunit of l-type calcium channels (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 2Glossmann H. Ferry D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 109: 513-550Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 3Catterall W.A. Striessnig J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 256-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 4Berger W. Prinz H. Striessnig J. Kang H.-C. Haugland R. Glossmann H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11875-11883Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, NFP inhibits in a dose-dependent manner the calcium mobilization that follows the interaction between apoptotic bodies and DC. Likewise, engulfment is prevented by DC exposure to this drug (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that DC express functional l-type calcium channels. This was confirmed by the finding of a specific 58-kDa band detectable by Western blot analysis of DC lysates with a monoclonal antibody recognizing the β1 calcium channel subunit (Fig. 1 C). Unlike in excitable tissues, these channels are voltage-independent, because exposure of DC to 50 mm KCl failed to induce a calcium influx (not shown). Exogenous HIV-1 Tat is able to inhibit both apoptotic body engulfment by DC and the [Ca2+]i rise induced by apoptotic body-DC interaction (19Zocchi M.R. Poggi A. Rubartelli A. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We thus investigated whether the inhibitory effect of Tat is due to the block of l-type calcium channels on DC. DC were loaded with apoptotic bodies, and the engulfment was measured under different conditions. Fig. 2 A shows that the inhibition of engulfment observed in the presence of HIV-1 Tat is prevented by DC pretreatment with Bay K 8644, a calcium channel agonist that induces Ca2+ entry by opening l-type channels (2Glossmann H. Ferry D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 109: 513-550Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Sadighi Akcha A.A. Willmott N.J. Brickley K. Dolphin A.C. Galione A. Hunt S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7297-7300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In turn, once DC have been pretreated with Tat, Bay K 8644 is unable to revert the inhibition (Fig. 2 A). The calcium influx elicited in DC by exposure to Bay K 8644 is blocked by pretreatment of DC with HIV-1 Tat in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B); in contrast, Tat does not affect the calcium channel-independent calcium rise that follows DC exposure to the ionophore ionomycin (Fig. 2 C). These data suggest that HIV-1 Tat competes with Bay K 8644 for binding to DHP-sensitive calcium channels. To further confirm this hypothesis, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of DC stained with DM-BODIPYR DHP, a fluorescent DHP derivative that binds to the α1C chain of l-type calcium channels (4Berger W. Prinz H. Striessnig J. Kang H.-C. Haugland R. Glossmann H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11875-11883Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of Tat or Bay K 8644. As shown in Fig. 3 A, DM-BODIPYR DHP stains DC, indicating the presence ofl-type channel α1C subunit on these cells. Tat antagonizes the DM-BODIPYR DHP binding with the same dose response as the α1C ligand Bay K 8644. In turn, the binding of biotinylated Tat to DC is cross-inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with Bay K 8644 (Fig. 3 B). In both cases, the unrelated peptide Fn-III, displaying the same length as HIV-1 Tat, has no effects (Fig. 3, A and B).Figure 3Bay K 8644 and HIV-1 Tat compete for binding to DC. A, DC untreated or pretreated for 20 min with Tat or Bay K 8644 or Fn-III peptide at different concentrations, as indicated, were stained with 3 nm DM-BODIPYR DHP and analyzed by FACSort (Becton Dickinson). Results are expressed as MFI (arbitrary units). B, DC untreated or pretreated for 20 min with Tat or Bay K 8644 or Fn-III peptide at different concentrations, as indicated, were stained with biotinylated Tat (Tat-biot) followed by phycoerythrin-streptavidin (PE-Av) and analyzed by FACSort. Results are expressed as MFI (arbitrary units).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) An important function of DC is to support T helper cell differentiation by IL-12 production (11Scott P. Science. 1993; 260: 496-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 12Lamont A.G. Adorini L. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 214-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Secretion of IL-12 is induced by various stimuli (11Scott P. Science. 1993; 260: 496-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 12Lamont A.G. Adorini L. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 214-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar); one of them is cross-linking of the surface lectin NKRP1A (13Poggi A. Rubartelli A. Moretta L. Zocchi M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2965-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because this triggering also results in Ca2+ entry (13Poggi A. Rubartelli A. Moretta L. Zocchi M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2965-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we investigated whether l-type calcium channels play a role in IL-12 release. NKRP1A molecules were cross-linked by the specific monoclonal antibody, and the secretion of IL-12 by DC in the presence or absence of NFP or HIV-1 Tat was measured. Fig. 4 A shows that the engagement of NKRP1A results in release of IL-12, which is prevented by exposure of DC to NFP. HIV-1 Tat proves to exert the same inhibition of NFP on NKRP1A-induced IL-12 production (Fig. 4 A). This inhibition was dose-dependent, being detectable up to 10 nm Tat (Fig. 4 A). Again, the calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644 is able to revert the inhibitory effect of HIV-1 Tat (Fig. 4 A). In keeping with these results, the calcium rise elicited by NKRP1A cross-linking in DC is inhibited by either the DHP drug NFP (Fig. 4 B) or HIV-1 Tat (Fig. 4 C), further supporting the hypothesis that both compounds exert their effects by acting on l-type calcium channels. In the present paper we show that molecular structures displaying pharmacological properties of l-type calcium channels (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar,2Glossmann H. Ferry D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 109: 513-550Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) mediate extracellular calcium influx in human DC. The presence of functional l-type Ca2+ channels in DC is supported by three lines of evidence: (i) Ca2+-dependent DC functions, such as apoptotic body engulfment and IL-12 production, are inhibited byl-type Ca2+ channel blockers; (ii) fluorescent DHP drugs, specific for the α1C chain of l-type channels (3Catterall W.A. Striessnig J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 256-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 4Berger W. Prinz H. Striessnig J. Kang H.-C. Haugland R. Glossmann H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11875-11883Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), bind to DC surface; and (iii) the calcium channel β1 chain is detectable in DC lysates. In contrast, N-type calcium channels (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 25Hille B. Trends Neurol. Sci. 1994; 17: 531-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) are not expressed, because fluorescent ω-conotoxin failed to stain DC (not shown). Although l-type calcium channels in excitable tissues are voltage-gated (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), DHP-sensitive Ca2+ channels in DC are voltage-independent, suggesting that they lack a membrane voltage sensor. This finding supports the recently reported data on the existence of voltage-independent DHP-sensitive channels on B lymphocytes (8Sadighi Akcha A.A. Willmott N.J. Brickley K. Dolphin A.C. Galione A. Hunt S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7297-7300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), raising the possibility of a common mechanism responsible for Ca2+ entry in immune cells. An important novel finding of this paper is that HIV-1 Tat blocks two calcium-mediated DC functions by acting on DHP-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Indeed, Tat-mediated inhibition of both apoptotic body engulfment and NKRP1A-induced IL-12 production is reverted by the l-type Ca2+-channel agonist Bay K 8644. In turn, Tat blocks the Ca2+ influx that follows triggering of DC with Bay K 8644. The finding that DHP derivatives and Tat compete for binding to DC strongly supports the hypothesis thatl-type calcium channels are the molecular targets of the inhibitory effects of Tat on DC. Several Tat binding molecules have been described on different cell types; Tat binds with high affinity vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (21Albini A. Soldi R. Giunciuglio D. Giraudo E. Benelli R. Primo L. Noonan D. Salio M. Camussi G. Rockl W. Bussolino F. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1371-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and CD26 (26Gutheil W.G. Subramanyam M. Flentke G.R.

Benelli R Presta M. Rusnati M. Ziche M. Rubartelli A. Paglialunga G. Bussolino F. Noonan D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 289-297PubMed Google Scholar), and with integrins like αvβ3 (28Brake D.A. Debouck C. Biesecker G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) or α5β1 (29Barillari G Gendelman R. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7941-7945Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). DHP drugs are able to strongly decrease the binding of biotinylated Tat to DC; thus, one major binding site for Tat on these cells seems to be represented by DHP-sensitive channels, although we cannot rule out binding to other receptors, which in turn can be associated to Ca2+ channels. The role of HIV-1 Tat in AIDS pathogenesis extends beyond its transcriptional activity; indeed, it is secreted by infected cells (14Ensoli B. Barillari G. Salahuddin S.Z. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1990; 345: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) and affects gene expression and function in many types of infected or noninfected cells (17Li C.J. Friedman D.J. Wang C.

Exogenous Tat proved to down-regulate immune cell functions; it inhibits antigen-induced T cell proliferation (15Viscidi R.P. Mayur H.K. Lederman M. Frankel A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1606-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), blocks the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (19Zocchi M.R. Poggi A. Rubartelli A. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and modulates cytokine production (16Westerndorp M.O. Li-Weber M. Frank R.W. Krammer P.H. J.

Nath A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22385-22388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Here we show that exogenous Tat inhibits IL-12 production elicited by NKRP1A engagement in DC. IL-12, originally described as NK cell stimulatory factor, is also involved in the differentiation of T helper cell subset 1 cells (11Scott P. Science. 1993; 260: 496-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 12Lamont A.G. Adorini L. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 214-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A deficient IL-12 production in AIDS patients may thus play a role in the progression of the disease (33Chehimi J. Starr S.E. Frank I. D'Andrea A. Ma X. MacGregor R.R. Sennelier J. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 34Clerici M. Lucey D.R. Berzofsky J.A. Pinto L.A. Wynn T.A. Blatt S.P. Dolan M.J. Hendrix C.W. Wolf S.F. Shearer G.M. Science. 1993; 262: 1721-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), which is associated with decreased NK cell function, loss of T helper cell subset 1 cells, and a corresponding increase in T helper cell subset 2 cells (33Chehimi J.

Today. 1993; 14: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). In light of these considerations, our data provide evidence for a molecular mechanism possibly underlying T helper cell subsets 1 and 2 embalance during HIV-1 infection, based on the Tat-mediated impairment of IL-12 production. The physiological relevance of our findings relies on the observation that nanomolar concentrations of HIV-1 Tat are detectable in the sera of AIDS patients (36Westerndorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the local amount of Tat in the mucosal and lymphoid tissues site of infection is higher due to the concentrating effect of extracellular matrix components, such as heparan sulfates, which bind to Tat (27Albini A. Benelli R Presta M. Rusnati M. Ziche M. Rubartelli A. Paglialunga G. Bussolino F. Noonan D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 289-297PubMed Google Scholar). This may explain the finding that in vitro, in the absence of matrix components, Tat is usually active at concentrations higher than those found in AIDS patient sera (15Viscidi R.P. Mayur H.K. Lederman M. Frankel A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1606-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 17Li C.J. Friedman D.J. Wang C. Metelev V. Pardee A.

Finally, the finding that Tat can act through blocking calcium channels may provide a universal key for understanding the molecular basis of exogenous Tat-mediated immunosuppressive effects during HIV-1 infection.

Additionally, HIV-1 matrix protein trimer unit structures align to the His-HIVCA trimer units such that residues previously shown to interact with the HIV-1 gp120/gp41 envelope protein complex are oriented toward the hexamer cage holes. Our results form a bridge between results from conventional methods for the analysis of HIV particle structure.

AIDS. 1991; 5: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The principal internal protein component of HIV-1 virions is encoded by the viral gag gene. Immature HIV-1 particles are composed of unprocessed 55-kDa Gag proteins (Pr55Gag) and appear to have an electron dense layer of material juxtaposed to the inner faces of their lipid envelopes (1Gelderblom H.R. AIDS. 1991; 5: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 2Nermut M. Hockley D. Jowett J. Jones I. Garreau M. Thomas D. Virology. 1994; 198: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, during or just after virus particle release from cells, Pr55Gag proteins are processed by the HIV-1 protease into the major mature Gag proteins matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), and p6. Proteolytically processed HIV-1 particles adopt a mature morphology, in which electron-dense material reorganizes into a central cone- or rod-shaped structure (1Gelderblom H.R. AIDS. 1991; 5: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Complete or partial structures for the MA, NC, and CA Gag proteins have been determined in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and x-ray crystallographic studies (3Matthews S. Barlow P.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3059-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The matrix protein, which interacts with the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein complex (SU/TM or gp120/gp41) and serves a membrane binding function, forms characteristic trimers in three different crystal forms (5Hill C. Worthylake D. Bancroft D. Christensen A. Sundquist W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3099-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The NC domain possesses two Cys-His finger motifs, which coordinate zinc ions and are important in RNA binding (10Morrelet N. Jullian N. De Rocquigny H. Maigret B. Darlix J.-L. Roques B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3059-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The capsid domain, which is crucial to virus particle assembly (11McDermott J. Farrell L. Ross R. Barklis E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has proven more difficult. However, partial structures of HIV-1 CA have shown that it is composed primarily of α helices (6Gitti R. Lee B. Walker J. Summers M. Yoo S. Sundquist W. Science. 1996; 273: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 7Momany C. Kovari L. Prongay A. Keller W. Gitti R. Lee B. Gorbalenya A. Tong L.

Science. 1997; 278: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), an unexpected contrast with the B-barrel or jellyroll structures, which constitute the capsid proteins of a number of other animal viruses. While NMR and x-ray structures of individual HIV-1 Gag proteins provide clues as to potential interprotein contacts within HIV-1 particles, much remains obscure. Several reports have suggested that mature and immature HIV-1 virions show icosahedral symmetry (1Gelderblom H.R. AIDS. 1991; 5: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 2Nermut M. Hockley D. Jowett J. Jones I. Garreau M. Thomas D. Virology. 1994; 198: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but high resolution support for this suggestion is needed. Analysis of mature virus cores has been hampered by difficulties in their isolation, although the recent demonstration that RNA-Gag (CA plus NC) complexes can be assembled in vitro (11McDermott J. Farrell L. Ross R. Barklis E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may lead to an accurate model for mature HIV-1 cores. However, the most developed model for the structure of HIV-1 is based on the immature virus form. In particular, examination of negatively stained membranes and immature HIV particles produced from a baculovirus vector led Nermut et al. (2Nermut M. Hockley D. Jowett J. Jones I. Garreau M. Thomas D. Virology. 1994; 198: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) to propose a “fullerene-like” particle structure. By this model, Pr55Gag proteins at viral or cell membranes appear to form hexamer rings surrounding protein-free “holes.” Although first order diffraction reflections at 65 Å−1 were barely discernible, results of averaging five subimages, assuming 6-fold rotational symmetry, suggested an arrangement in which only one Pr55Gag monomer would be shared by two adjacent hexamer units (2Nermut M. Hockley D. Jowett J. Jones I. Garreau M. Thomas D. Virology. 1994; 198: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). More recent cryo-EM analysis of disrupted HIV-1 virus-like particles also showed that Pr55Gag proteins appear to form a cage-like structure, although in this case, cage hole-to-hole distances appeared to be on the order of 48 Å (13Fuller S. Wilk T. Gowen B. Krausslich H.-G. Vogt V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 729-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In our current study, we describe a method for the analysis of HIV-1 capsid proteins, assembled in vitro on a lipid monolayer. Our results show that membrane-bound HIV-1 CA proteins organize into a hexamer-trimer cage-like network that explains previous structural results in a consistent model. The His-HIVCA protein has been described previously (11McDermott J. Farrell L. Ross R. Barklis E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and consists of the HIV-1 coding region with an amino-terminal histidine tag and a 3.3-kDa COOH-terminal extension. The His-HIVCA protein was purified and analyzed as described previously (11McDermott J. Farrell L. Ross R. Barklis E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hochuli E. Dobeli H. Schacher A. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 411: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). For monolayer incubations, we followed our standard protocol (14Barklis E. McDermott J. Wilkens S. Schabtach E. Schmid M. Fuller S. Karanjia S. Love Z. Jones R. Rui Y. Zhao X. Thompson D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with the subphase containing 0.5–2.0 mg/ml His-HIVCA in subphase buffer at pH 7.8 or 8.3. Subphase solutions were overlayered as described (14Barklis E. McDermott J. Wilkens S. Schabtach E. Schmid M. Fuller S. Karanjia S. Love Z. Jones R. Rui Y. Zhao X. Thompson D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with 1:1 hexane:chloroform containing 200 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) plus 50 μg/ml nickel-charged DHGN (1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-(1′-2′′-R-hydroxy-3′-N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid)propyl ether). After overnight incubation at 25–30 °C, arrays were lifted onto lacey grids, washed 30 s in distilled water, and either negative-stained in 1.33% uranyl acetate or plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. Monolayer arrays were viewed and photographed at the Portland Veterans Affairs Hospital JEOL JEM12OOEX, the University of Oregon Philips CM12, or the EMBL-Heidelberg Philips CM200-FEG as described previously (14Barklis E. McDermott J. Wilkens S. Schabtach E. Schmid M. Fuller S. Karanjia S. Love Z. Jones R. Rui Y. Zhao X. Thompson D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Crystalline areas on micrographs were identified by optical diffraction, and images were scanned and digitized using either the EMBL-Heidelberg Perkin-Elmer 1010GM flat-bed scanner at 2.63 Å/pixel or an Optronics CCD mounted on a dissecting microscope at 5.25 Å/pixel. Since CM200-FEG images used in averages were taken at 900 nm defocus, corresponding to a first contrast transfer function zero of approximately 15.1 Å, contrast transfer function correction was not applied in our analyses. Image analysis steps employed both the MRC (16Crowther R. Henderson R. Smith J. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 17Hardt S. Wang B. Schmid M.F. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and SPIDER (18Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar) image analysis packages. Initially, ordered areas, identified by optical diffraction, were scanned, converted to MRC image files, boxed using BOXMRC, Fourier-transformed, and viewed as diffraction patterns on SPECTRA (19Faecke M. Janetzko A. Shoeman R. Krausslich H.-G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4972-4980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Diffraction patterns were indexed by hand, masked, and back-transformed to yield crude filtered images (14Barklis E. McDermott J. Wilkens S. Schabtach E. Schmid M. Fuller S. Karanjia S. Love Z. Jones R. Rui Y. Zhao X. Thompson D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Hardt S. Wang B. Schmid M.F. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For more thorough analysis, SPIDER (18Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar) real space operations were used. Twenty 168.3 Å × 168.3 Å windows, corresponding to approximately two p1 unit cells from the initial filtered images, were picked using the SPIDER operation WI from scanned negative 8347 that had been Gaussian low pass filtered to 32.9-Å resolution. The filtered windows were aligned using the AP RA and AP SA operations and averaged using the AD command. The averaged image then was used as a reference with the programs CC and PK D to pick three sets of cross-correlation peaks: 100 image windows from negative 8347; the best 280 cross-correlation peaks from five digitized negatives; and 1000 windows from the five negatives. Windows from each data set were aligned to a black and white contrast version of the averaged reference window. Aligned windows in each set were averaged using the SPIDER AD operation. For statistical analysis, data sets were halved, averaged, and compared with obtain Fourier ring correlation (FRC) indices at different rings of resolution using RF M. Image averages subsequently were filtered using FQ to 24.0 Å resolution in accordance with FRC results. For rotational averaging, a rotational series of the averaged, negative 8347 data set was generated using RT, and rotated images were compared with the unrotated original using RF M, identifying rotational correlation peaks. The original plus its 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300° rotations were averaged to give a rotationally averaged image: the FRC of the 0, 120, and 240° average versus the 60, 180, and 300° average was 0.90 at 36.0 Å resolution and 0.62 at 22.4 Å resolution. To simulate the lower resolution obtained in previous studies, the 6-fold rotationally averaged image was Gaussian low pass filtered to 52.6 Å resolution using the FQ operation. For alignment of HIV-1 matrix protein trimers onto His-HIVCA arrays, the MA trimer unit from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (accession number 1H1W) was imaged on MIDAS, rotated so that the 3-fold axis was normal to the projection and the predicted internal face of the virus (4Rao Z. Belyaev A. Fry E. Roy P. Jones I. Stuart D. Nature. 1995; 378: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Hill C. Worthylake D. Bancroft D. Christensen A. Sundquist W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3099-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), and scaled. The scaled MA trimer image was converted to SPIDER image format, used to generate a 120° rotational series of windows at 1° intervals, and each rotated trimer was cross-correlated to the six-fold rotationally averaged His-HIVCA image. The best alignment had the highest value cross-correlation peak. For display purposes, all images were converted from either MRC or SPIDER image formats to TIFF files and displayed using Adobe Photoshop software. To circumvent difficulties that have limited the structural analysis of HIV-1 particles, we have adapted the lipid monolayer method of two-dimensional protein crystallization (22Uzgiris E. Kornberg R. Nature. 1983; 301: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) for analysis of HIV-1 Gag protein interactions. To do so, lipid monolayers were made from phosphatidylcholine (PC) plus a dialkylglycerol derivative, DHGN, which carries a nickel-chelating head group that binds histidine-tagged (His-tagged) proteins (14Barklis E. McDermott J. Wilkens S. Schabtach E. Schmid M. Fuller S. Karanjia S. Love Z. Jones R. Rui Y. Zhao X. Thompson D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 Gag protein chosen for analysis, His-HIVCA, was an HIV-1 (HXB2) capsid protein derivative with an amino-terminal His tag (11McDermott J. Farrell L. Ross R. Barklis E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our rationale for using the matrix-deleted His-HIVCA protein was that the His tag-DHGN interaction should substitute for the membrane binding function of MA. Furthermore, studies have shown that large HIV-1 matrix deletions are compatible with virus particle assembly (19Faecke M. Janetzko A. Shoeman R. Krausslich H.-G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4972-4980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wang C. Zhang Y. McDermott J. Barklis E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although His-HIVCA also lacks the NC and p6 COOH-terminal domains of Pr55Gag, this did not prevent his-HIVCA from mimicking interactions observed for the full-length protein (see below). The recombinant His-HIVCA protein was produced in Escherichia coli and purified to greater than 95% homogeneity by two rounds of nondenaturing nickel-chelate chromatography (15Hochuli E. Dobeli H. Schacher A. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 411: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). As a conformation check, His-HIVCA and HIV-1 CA isolated from virus particles were subjected in parallel to a partial proteolytic treatments, and each protein yielded a characteristic COOH-terminal 14-kDa partial trypsin fragment. When His-HIVCA proteins were used in monolayer incubations with PC plus DHGN, protein arrays with small patches of crystallinity were observed with either stained samples (Fig. 1 A) or samples frozen in vitreous water. While such regions could be difficult to detect in cryo-EM micrographs (see Fig. 1 B), they were evident in low pass filtered cryo-EM images (Fig. 1 C). In small regions, His-HIVCA proteins were ordered well enough to obtain distinct diffraction patterns, as shown in Fig. 1 D. Despite sample drift for this negative, the reflections at 26.1 Å−1 are clearly evident, and the primitive (p1) unit cell of a= 74.8 Å, b = 126.2 Å, γ = 89.3° is reminiscent of the a = 79.2 Å, b = 137.5 Å, γ = 89.7° unit cell observed for capsid proteins of another retrovirus, the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) (1Gelderblom H.R. AIDS. 1991; 5: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 14Barklis E. McDermott J. Wilkens S. Schabtach E. Schmid M. Fuller S. Karanjia S. Love Z. Jones R. Rui Y. Zhao X. Thompson D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, back-transformation of masked diffraction patterns from small ordered regions yielded images (Fig. 1 E) showing a cage-like structure of proteins (light) surrounding protein-free cage holes (dark), similar to those seen for M-MuLV CA (14Barklis E. McDermott J. Wilkens S. Schabtach E. Schmid M. Fuller S. Karanjia S. Love Z. Jones R. Rui Y. Zhao X. Thompson D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and HIV-1 Pr55Gag (2Nermut M. Hockley D. Jowett J. Jones I. Garreau M. Thomas D. Virology. 1994; 198: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because the sizes of ordered His-HIVCA patches were not large enough to permit a thorough analysis by standard diffraction analysis methods (16Crowther R. Henderson R. Smith J. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 17Hardt S. Wang B. Schmid M.F. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we opted to analyze His-HIVCA monolayer structures by a modification of single particle analysis methods (18Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). To do so, an image-averaged reference corresponding to approximately two p1 unit cells (168.3 Å × 168.3 Å) was used to locate cross-correlation peaks from five separate digitized micrographs. As expected from the low pass filtered image (Fig. 1 C), peaks tended to be located in small ordered patches throughout the micrographs (Fig. 1 F). From cross-correlation maps, three data sets were derived. These consisted of 100 image windows from our highest quality micrograph, 280 windows corresponding to the best cross-correlation peaks, and 1000 windows (total) from the five micrographs. All windows were aligned to a black and white averaged reference window, after which data sets were merged to obtain 100-image, 280-image, and 1000-image averages (Fig. 2, A–C). To evaluate results, each data set was halved, and averages from each half set were compared with their counterparts at different rings of resolution. As shown in Table I, for each data set, Fourier ring correlation values fall off at resolutions better than 24.0 Å. These results are consistent with the observation of reflections at 26.1 Å−1 (Fig. 1 D), and Figs. 2, D–F, have been filtered to this resolution limit.Table IPhase residual and Fourier ring correlation (FRC) values of averaged data sets at different resolution rangesResolution rangeFRC100-Image280-Image1000-ImageÅ≥168.30.880.950.99168.3–56.10.950.990.9956.1–33.70.920.960.9733.7–24.00.610.690.7324.0–18.70.160.060.29 Open table in a new tab The most obvious features of the His-HIVCA structures shown in Fig. 2are the large circular holes of 26.3 Å in the protein cage, which are bordered by six rectangularly shaped protein units. However, each circular hole also is surrounded by six smaller protein-free zones, which in turn are bordered by three rectangular units. Thus, membrane-bound HIV-1 capsid appears to form a cage consisting of hexamer and trimer units. Since previous lower resolution studies onin vivo derived immature HIV-1 particles employed a 6-fold rotational averaging scheme in image reconstructions (2Nermut M. Hockley D. Jowett J. Jones I. Garreau M. Thomas D. Virology. 1994; 198: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we wished to assess the results of rotational averaging for comparative purposes. As shown in Fig. 3 A (top panel), the large cage holes in the HIV-1 capsid arrays appeared as 6-fold rotational axes, and the averaged image correlated with its 60° rotation to about 21.3 Å (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel). Six-fold averaging increased the distinction of putative monomer units (Fig. 3 B), and when this image was filtered to 52.6 Å resolution, the four rectangular units separating each trimer hole appeared as single electron-dense units (Fig. 3 C). The resultant image compares well with HIV-1 Pr55Gag arrays at membranes and in disrupted immature virus particles (2Nermut M. Hockley D. Jowett J. Jones I. Garreau M. Thomas D. Virology. 1994; 198: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Fuller S. Wilk T. Gowen B. Krausslich H.-G. Vogt V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 729-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In particular, the 74.2-Å hexamer to hexamer cage hole spacing that we observe (Figs. 2and 3) is consistent with the spacing observed for Pr55Gag proteins arranged on the plasma membranes of baculovirus vector-infected cells (2Nermut M. Hockley D. Jowett J. Jones I. Garreau M. Thomas D. Virology. 1994; 198: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Since that study used negatively stained samples and was at low resolution, we believe that trimer cage holes were not resolved, much as they are not resolved in our low pass filtered image (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, cryo-EM analysis of disrupted immature HIV-1 particles has shown a cage hole center-to-center spacing of approximately 48 Å (13Fuller S. Wilk T. Gowen B. Krausslich H.-G. Vogt V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 729-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), which is in good agreement with our observation of trimer to hexamer cage hole spacing of 44.9 Å. Given the above observations, it appears that membrane-bound HIV-1 CA proteins assemble in a fashion similar to the full-length Pr55Gag proteins. This may seem surprising, since Gag protein nucleocapsid (NC) domains, possibly through associations with RNA, exert a strong influence on retrovirus particle assembly (12Campbell S. Vogt V. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6487-6497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Barklis E. McDermott J. Wilkens S. Schabtach E. Schmid M. Fuller S. Karanjia S. Love Z. Jones R. Rui Y. Zhao X. Thompson D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the similarity of our HIV-1 CA projection structure (Figs. 2 and 3), and that of Pr55Gag proteins in virus-like particles (2Nermut M. Hockley D. Jowett J. Jones I. Garreau M. Thomas D. Virology. 1994; 198: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), is consistent with indications that MA, CA, and NC domains in Pr55Gag molecules stack roughly as long rods (13Fuller S. Wilk T. Gowen B. Krausslich H.-G. Vogt V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 729-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesize that NC and RNA interactions do not alter the basic arrangements of membrane-tethered capsid proteins, at least at our level of detection. Although the HIV-1 CA hexamer-trimer arrangement agrees with available data on immature HIV-1 patches, it differs slightly from the hexamer-hexamer arrangement, which M-MuLV capsid proteins form on membrane monolayers (14Barklis E. McDermott J. Wilkens S. Schabtach E. Schmid M. Fuller S. Karanjia S. Love Z. Jones R. Rui Y. Zhao X. Thompson D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In particular, M-MuLV capsid proteins form arrays in which roughly symmetrical hexamer cage holes are surrounded by six skewed hexamer cage holes. Also, in contrast with HIV-1 CA arrays, in which each monomer unit contributes to one hexamer and one trimer, M-MuLV monomer units each contribute to one symmetrical and two skewed cage holes (14Barklis E. McDermott J. Wilkens S. Schabtach E. Schmid M. Fuller S. Karanjia S. Love Z. Jones R. Rui Y. Zhao X. Thompson D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at hexamer vertices, it appears that putative HIV-1 CA monomers coordinate with three other monomer units, while M-MuLV monomers coordinate only with two additional monomers. However, both M-MuLV and HIV-1 arrangements suggest that cytoplasmic portions of the retroviral Env proteins may be accommodated in the hexamer cage hole regions. For HIV, if this is the case, then one might expect that the Pr55Gag matrix domains ordinarily should be positioned between the viral membranes and the CA domains. In keeping with this hypothesis, when HIV-1 matrix trimers as observed in three-dimensional crystals were oriented toward viral membranes as predicted previously (3Matthews S. Barlow P. Boyd J.

https://openalex.org/W2079653456,"We tested the involvement of N-terminal six disulfide bonds (Cys-1 through Cys-12) of human apolipoprotein (apo) B in the assembly and secretion of lipoproteins using two C-terminal-truncated apoB variants, namely B50 and B18. In transfected rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells, B50 could assemble very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and B18 was secreted as high density lipoproteins. When all 12 cysteine residues were substituted with alanines in B50, the mutant protein (B50C1–12) lost its ability to assemble lipid and was degraded intracellularly. However, mutation had no effect on B50C1–12 translation or translocation across the microsomal membrane. Post-translational degradation of B50C1–12 was partially inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. To determine which cysteines were critical in VLDL assembly and secretion, we prepared three additional mutant B50s, each containing four selected Cys-to-Ala substitutions in tandem (i.e. Cys-1 to Cys-4, Cys-5 to Cys-8, and Cys-9 to Cys-12). Expression of these mutants showed that disruption of disulfide bond formation within Cys-5 to Cys-8 diminished apoB secretion, whereas within Cys-1 to Cys-4 or Cys-9 to Cys-12 had lesser or no effect. In another two mutants in which only one disulfide bond (i.e. between Cys-5 and Cys-6 or between Cys-7 and Cys-8) was eliminated, only secretion of B50 with mutations at Cys-7 and Cys-8 was decreased. Thus, the disulfide bond involving Cys-7 and Cys-8 is most important for VLDL assembly and secretion. In addition, assembly and secretion of VLDL containing endogenous B100 or B48 were impaired in cells transfected with B50s containing Cys-7 and Cys-8 mutation. The Cys-to-Ala substitution abolished recognition of B50 by MB19, a conformational antibody with an epitope at the N terminus of human apoB. The Cys-to-Ala substitution also attenuated secretion of B18, but the effect of the mutation on B18 secretion was less evident than on B50.

Yang M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is not clear why the region of apoB with low lipid binding ability is essential for efficient assembly of lipid into a lipoprotein.Of eight disulfide linkages within human plasma apoB, six are located within the N-terminal 500 amino acids (17Yang C.-Y. Kim T.W. Weng S.-A. Lee B. Yang M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, involvement of the concentrated disulfide bonds within the N terminus of apoB in lipoprotein assembly and secretion has been examined. Using dithiothreitol to disrupt disulfide bonding, Shelness and Thornburg (18Shelness G.S. Thornburg J.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 408-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have observed that formation of the N-terminal disulfide bonds, which occurs within 1 min of translation, is required for the initiation of MTP-dependent lipid recruitment and the secretion of lipoproteins. It has been postulated that folding of the N-terminal region, presumably mediated through disulfide bonding, is essential for lipoprotein assembly (19Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Considering the intrinsic nature of protein folding and the role of disulfide bonds in stabilizing native protein conformation, we hypothesized that the N-terminal six disulfide bonds play a crucial role in VLDL assembly and secretion.In the current studies, we have directly examined the function of six disulfide bonds using two truncated forms of apoB, apoB50 that has the ability to form VLDL and apoB18 that does not associate with neutral lipids. In these proteins, the cysteine residues were selectively substituted with alanine. Our results demonstrate that the fourth disulfide bond (between Cys-7 and Cys-8) is most important for apoB50 to assemble VLDL. However, the requirement for disulfide bonds is less manifest in apoB18. The present results suggest that an interaction between the disulfide-bonded domain and the downstream lipid binding sequences may play an important role in the post-translational stability of apoB and in VLDL assembly and secretion.DISCUSSIONProtein folding and conformational stabilization by disulfide bonds during translation and translocation into the ER is re-garded as a crucial step for the sorting of many secretory proteins. Using site-directed mutagenesis to selectively eliminate disulfide bond formation within B50, we have observed that not all, but only the fourth pair of cysteines (Cys-7 and Cys-8) is essential for the formation and secretion of B50-VLDL (Fig. 4 B) and for efficient B50 secretion (Fig. 5 B). Mutation at other disulfide bonds has less or no effect, whereas elimination of all six disulfide bonds (B50C1–12) almost abolishes B50 secretion as lipoproteins. The decreased secretion of mutant B50 is not caused by reduced protein expression nor is it attributable to impaired translocation across the ER membrane. Rather, the failure to secrete mutant B50 results from a defect at the post-translational level, leading to degradation of the secretion-incompetent proteins. It is most likely that the inefficiency of lipid recruitment impairs secretion of the mutant proteins. The specific requirement for the fourth disulfide bond in B50 is striking, which suggests that the failed assembly and secretion of mutant B50-VLDL may not be simply the consequence of misfolding of the N terminus of apoB. In fact, mutation at cysteine residues other than Cys-7 and Cys-8 equally impairs proper folding of apoB (as determined by the reduced affinity to MB19 shown in Fig. 8 D) but has less effect on B50 secretion. Therefore, it is possible that the fourth disulfide bond plays an important functional role in lipid assembly other than a structural role in folding. However, the possibility that mutation at Cys-7 and Cys-8 may affect the correct formation of other disulfide bonds within apoB has not been ruled out.Unexpectedly, mutation at Cys-7 and Cys-8 also impairs assembly and secretion of endogenous VLDL (Figs. 2 A, 3 C, and4 C). Intracellular degradation of endogenous B100 and B48 are markedly increased in cells transfected with mutant B50. Expression of misfolded proteins inside the ER has been shown to induce expression of some molecular chaperones that assist both the folding and degradation processes (33Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 34Knittler M.R. Dirks S. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Considering that lipid assembly is a general process for both endogenous and exogenous apoBs, expression of mutant B50 lacking the functional disulfide bond at Cys-7 and Cys-8 may trigger a stress response that typically affects lipid assembly. This would then generate unstable apoB molecules that are more susceptible to degradation. The nature of this stress response is not known. Identification of molecular chaperones or protease systems that are induced in cells transfected with mutant B50 may provide an explanation for the enhanced degradation of endogenous apoBs.Another important observation made in the current study is the oleate-induced covalent complex formation of apoB in the microsomal membrane (Fig. 8). Direct interaction of apoB with MTP and other ER resident proteins, including BiP/grp78 and calnexin, has been recently demonstrated (35Patel S.B. Grundy S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18686-18694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L.-S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10277-10281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our results are the first demonstration that complex formation is sensitive to mutations at the N-terminal cysteines of apoB. The concept of a high-order association of ER resident proteins forming a matrix or a gel inside the ER lumen led to a new paradigm that newly synthesized proteins form complexes of heterogeneous sizes with each other or with ER molecular chaperones to acquire more intrachain disulfide bonds until they are fully oxidized and released from the aggregates (37Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 38Kellokumpu S. Suokas M. Risteli L. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2770-2777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Vesicular stomatitis virus G proteins and procollagen chains are a few of the examples demonstrating complex formation with protein folding catalysts such as BiP/grp78 and protein disulfide isomerase before their maturation (38Kellokumpu S. Suokas M. Risteli L. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2770-2777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39de Silva A. Braakman I. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similar biochemical events may also occur during apoB-lipoprotein assembly, involving transient protein-protein interactions until the apoB polypeptide achieves a certain degree of lipidation to become secretion-competent.The current studies have emphasized that interfering with folding of the N terminus of apoB in general has less effect on the secretion of B18 than on B50. Although secretion of apoB18 is abolished when the six pairs of cysteines are mutated, its secretion is relatively resistant to one- or two-pair cysteine mutations. Thus, the stringent requirement for the disulfide bonding appears to be by and large dependent on MTP-mediated lipid assembly. On the other hand, gross disruption of disulfide bonding affects both lipid recruitment and protein secretion. On the basis of these observations, we postulate that correct folding and lipid association may represent two interdependent biochemical events that, in concert with the ER quality control system, regulate the assembly and secretion of VLDL. (a) Proper folding of a critical region involving the fourth disulfide bond might signal a lipid recruitment sensor to initiate VLDL assembly. This forward-signaling event (that is, appropriate folding of the N terminus precedes lipid assembly by acting as an acceptor for MTP) has been suggested by studies with dithiothreitol-treated HepG2 cells (19Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). (b) The downstream lipid binding sequences, after acquiring adequate lipid load might in turn signal the ER quality control to release the secretion-competent particle. This reverse-signaling event has been suggested by studies with oleate-treated Sf-21 cells transfected with apoB, MTP, and protein disulfide isomerase (40Wang L. Fast D.G. Attie A.D. J. Biol.

It is not clear why the region of apoB with low lipid binding ability is essential for efficient assembly of lipid into a lipoprotein. Of eight disulfide linkages within human plasma apoB, six are located within the N-terminal 500 amino acids (17Yang C.-Y. Kim T.W. Weng S.-A. Lee B. Yang M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, involvement of the concentrated disulfide bonds within the N terminus of apoB in lipoprotein assembly and secretion has been examined. Using dithiothreitol to disrupt disulfide bonding, Shelness and Thornburg (18Shelness G.S. Thornburg J.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 408-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have observed that formation of the N-terminal disulfide bonds, which occurs within 1 min of translation, is required for the initiation of MTP-dependent lipid recruitment and the secretion of lipoproteins. It has been postulated that folding of the N-terminal region, presumably mediated through disulfide bonding, is essential for lipoprotein assembly (19Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Considering the intrinsic nature of protein folding and the role of disulfide bonds in stabilizing native protein conformation, we hypothesized that the N-terminal six disulfide bonds play a crucial role in VLDL assembly and secretion. In the current studies, we have directly examined the function of six disulfide bonds using two truncated forms of apoB, apoB50 that has the ability to form VLDL and apoB18 that does not associate with neutral lipids. In these proteins, the cysteine residues were selectively substituted with alanine. Our results demonstrate that the fourth disulfide bond (between Cys-7 and Cys-8) is most important for apoB50 to assemble VLDL. However, the requirement for disulfide bonds is less manifest in apoB18. The present results suggest that an interaction between the disulfide-bonded domain and the downstream lipid binding sequences may play an important role in the post-translational stability of apoB and in VLDL assembly and secretion. DISCUSSIONProtein folding and conformational stabilization by disulfide bonds during translation and translocation into the ER is re-garded as a crucial step for the sorting of many secretory proteins. Using site-directed mutagenesis to selectively eliminate disulfide bond formation within B50, we have observed that not all, but only the fourth pair of cysteines (Cys-7 and Cys-8) is essential for the formation and secretion of B50-VLDL (Fig. 4 B) and for efficient B50 secretion (Fig. 5 B). Mutation at other disulfide bonds has less or no effect, whereas elimination of all six disulfide bonds (B50C1–12) almost abolishes B50 secretion as lipoproteins. The decreased secretion of mutant B50 is not caused by reduced protein expression nor is it attributable to impaired translocation across the ER membrane. Rather, the failure to secrete mutant B50 results from a defect at the post-translational level, leading to degradation of the secretion-incompetent proteins. It is most likely that the inefficiency of lipid recruitment impairs secretion of the mutant proteins. The specific requirement for the fourth disulfide bond in B50 is striking, which suggests that the failed assembly and secretion of mutant B50-VLDL may not be simply the consequence of misfolding of the N terminus of apoB. In fact, mutation at cysteine residues other than Cys-7 and Cys-8 equally impairs proper folding of apoB (as determined by the reduced affinity to MB19 shown in Fig. 8 D) but has less effect on B50 secretion. Therefore, it is possible that the fourth disulfide bond plays an important functional role in lipid assembly other than a structural role in folding. However, the possibility that mutation at Cys-7 and Cys-8 may affect the correct formation of other disulfide bonds within apoB has not been ruled out.Unexpectedly, mutation at Cys-7 and Cys-8 also impairs assembly and secretion of endogenous VLDL (Figs. 2 A, 3 C, and4 C). Intracellular degradation of endogenous B100 and B48 are markedly increased in cells transfected with mutant B50. Expression of misfolded proteins inside the ER has been shown to induce expression of some molecular chaperones that assist both the folding and degradation processes (33Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 34Knittler M.R. Dirks S. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Considering that lipid assembly is a general process for both endogenous and exogenous apoBs, expression of mutant B50 lacking the functional disulfide bond at Cys-7 and Cys-8 may trigger a stress response that typically affects lipid assembly. This would then generate unstable apoB molecules that are more susceptible to degradation. The nature of this stress response is not known. Identification of molecular chaperones or protease systems that are induced in cells transfected with mutant B50 may provide an explanation for the enhanced degradation of endogenous apoBs.Another important observation made in the current study is the oleate-induced covalent complex formation of apoB in the microsomal membrane (Fig. 8). Direct interaction of apoB with MTP and other ER resident proteins, including BiP/grp78 and calnexin, has been recently demonstrated (35Patel S.B. Grundy S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18686-18694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L.-S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Our results are the first demonstration that complex formation is sensitive to mutations at the N-terminal cysteines of apoB. The concept of a high-order association of ER resident proteins forming a matrix or a gel inside the ER lumen led to a new paradigm that newly synthesized proteins form complexes of heterogeneous sizes with each other or with ER molecular chaperones to acquire more intrachain disulfide bonds until they are fully oxidized and released from the aggregates (37Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 38Kellokumpu S. Suokas M. Risteli L. Myllylä R. J. Biol.

Similar biochemical events may also occur during apoB-lipoprotein assembly, involving transient protein-protein interactions until the apoB polypeptide achieves a certain degree of lipidation to become secretion-competent.The current studies have emphasized that interfering with folding of the N terminus of apoB in general has less effect on the secretion of B18 than on B50. Although secretion of apoB18 is abolished when the six pairs of cysteines are mutated, its secretion is relatively resistant to one- or two-pair cysteine mutations. Thus, the stringent requirement for the disulfide bonding appears to be by and large dependent on MTP-mediated lipid assembly. On the other hand, gross disruption of disulfide bonding affects both lipid recruitment and protein secretion. On the basis of these observations, we postulate that correct folding and lipid association may represent two interdependent biochemical events that, in concert with the ER quality control system, regulate the assembly and secretion of VLDL. (a) Proper folding of a critical region involving the fourth disulfide bond might signal a lipid recruitment sensor to initiate VLDL assembly. This forward-signaling event (that is, appropriate folding of the N terminus precedes lipid assembly by acting as an acceptor for MTP) has been suggested by studies with dithiothreitol-treated HepG2 cells (19Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). (b) The downstream lipid binding sequences, after acquiring adequate lipid load might in turn signal the ER quality control to release the secretion-competent particle. This reverse-signaling event has been suggested by studies with oleate-treated Sf-21 cells transfected with apoB, MTP, and protein disulfide isomerase (40Wang L. Fast D.G. Attie A.D. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2082052813,The marine bivalved Brachiopoda are abundant throughout the geological record and have apatitic (CaPO 4 -rich) or calcitic (CaCO 3 -rich) shells. Vesicles covering the larval valves of living apatitic-shelled discinids contain tablets of silica. The tablets are cemented into close-packed mosaics by spherular apatite in glycosaminoglycans. They are usually lost as vesicles degrade but leave imprints on the underlying apatitic shell. Similar imprints ornament larval surfaces of some of the earliest Paleozoic apatitic-shelled brachiopods and may also be indicators of siliceous biomineralization.

Sendai virus-mediated hemagglutinin assay in the presence of SV-201 demonstrated that the peptide does not disturb the binding of virions to the target red blood cells. A mutated peptide with 2 amino acids substitution, rendering the peptide neutral, was biologically inactive. A second mutant with 7 amino acids randomized at the N terminus keeping the hydrophobicity of the peptide unaltered was only slightly active. A hydrophobic peptide corresponding to the fusion peptide domain was also inactive. SV-201, the two mutants, and the fusion peptide bind similarly with high affinity to both negatively charged phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine and zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine lipid vesicles, suggesting that the inhibitory effect is not due merely to membrane modulation. Fluorescence studies with rhodamine-labeled peptides and SV-201-induced inhibition assays, demonstrated that the SV-201 binding site is most probably located in the region corresponding to amino acids 201–229 of the Sendai virus fusion protein. The data presented here suggest that SV-201 disturbs a functional domain in the Sendai virus fusion protein, which is most probably associated with the assembly of the fusion protein and/or membrane apposition.

Penetration of enveloped viruses into host cells involves the fusion of viral and cellular membranes and the subsequent transfer of genetic material into the target cell (1Stegmann T. Doms R.W.

Some of the enveloped viruses, including single-stranded RNA viruses such as influenza viruses, and alphaviruses, are internalized into the target cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis at acidic pH (4Wiley D.C.

However, the viral envelopes of e.g. paramyxoviruses and retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus, fuse directly with the cellular plasma membrane at neutral pH (2Hoekstra D. Kok J.W.

The role of the F2 subunit in the paramyxovirus-mediated membrane fusion process is not yet clearly understood. Reduction of disulfide bonds on the F1-F2 fusion protein results in loss of fusion activity, which may mean that F2 is required for the function of the fusion protein (27Nussbaum O. Zakai N. Loyter A. Virology. 1984; 138: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the role of the fusion peptide of the viral envelope glycoprotein has been substantiated, it is difficult to envision that the entire fusion process is determined solely through the small N-terminal region of the fusion protein. Indeed, recent reports point to the possible involvement of heptad repeats located adjacent to the fusion peptide region and the transmembrane anchor domain in the mediation of membrane fusion. Heptad repeats have been assumed to play a role in the assembly of the fusion protein of the influenza virus (28Carr C.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), HIV (29Shugars D.C. Wild C.T. Greenwell T.K. Matthews T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2982-2991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Sendai virus (30Rapaport D. Ovadia M. Shai Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the heptad repeats of the fusion proteins of the measles virus (31Buckland R. Malvoisin E. Beauverger P. Wild F. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1703-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the transmembrane gp41 of HIV (32Dubay J.W. Roberts S.J. Brody B. Hunter E. J.

Virol. 1994; 68: 7654-7658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) severely affect viral activity. Furthermore, synthetic peptides corresponding to heptad repeats of HIV (35Wild C. Oas T. McDanal C.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and several paramyxoviruses (38Lambert D.M. Barney S. Lambert A.L. Guthrie R. Medinas R. Davis D.E. Bucy T. Erickson J. Merutka G. Petteway Jr., S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2186-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) can inhibit viral-induced cell fusion by their corresponding viruses. Hydropathy plot of Sendai virus fusion protein shows that in addition to the N-terminal fusion peptide and the transmembrane anchor domain, there are other significantly hydrophobic regions within the ectodomain of the fusion protein (39Blumberg B.M. Giorgi C. Rose K. Kolakofsky D. J. Gen. Virol. 1985; 66: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This may indicate that additional regions may be involved with the membrane fusion process. To study this possibility, we selected SV-201 (amino acids 201–229), a domain with intermediate hydrophobicity, preceding the N-terminal heptad repeat and which potentially can form an amphipathic α-helix structure. This region is not only extremely conserved in the Sendai virus family but also has appreciable amino acid homology with the corresponding regions of other paramyxoviruses (Fig. 1). We have synthesized SV-201 and two mutant peptides, Mu1SV-201 and Mu2SV-201. In Mu1SV-201, 2 conserved amino acids were substituted by 2 negatively charged amino acids to retain the peptide with a zero net charge, and in Mu2SV-201, 7 amino acids at the N terminus were randomized keeping the hydrophobicity of the peptide unaltered. We found that SV-201 but not the two mutants and the hydrophobic 33-amino acid fusion peptide of the Sendai virus was a potent inhibitor of virus-induced hemolysis. SV-201 inhibited lysis only when it was incubated with the virions prior to, but not after, their attachment to red blood cells. However, both the wild type and mutant peptides could not inhibit virus-mediated agglutination of human red blood cells. These results, together with data obtained using fluorescently labeled wild type and mutant peptides, are discussed in terms of the possible role of the SV-201 domain of the Sendai virus fusion protein in the assembly of the fusion protein during the initial step of the fusion process and in membrane apposition. Butyloxycarbonyl-amino acid phenylacetamidomethyl resin and dimethylformamide (peptide synthesis grade) were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), and butyloxycarbonyl-amino acids were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Other reagents for peptide synthesis included trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma),N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Aldrich, distilled over ninhydrin), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (Fluka), and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (Pierce). Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS) from bovine spinal cord (sodium salt, grade I) were purchased from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, United Kingdom). NBD-F (4-fluoro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Buffers were prepared in doubly glass-distilled water. The peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method on the corresponding resin (0.15 meq) as described previously (40Shai Y. Bach D. Yanovsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20202-20209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Double coupling was carried out with freshly prepared hydroxybenzotriazole-active esters of butyloxycarbonyl-amino acids. Labeling of the N terminus of a peptide was achieved as reported previously (42Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6502-6509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 mg of a resin-bound peptide in its fully protected form was treated with trifluoroacetic acid (50% v/v in methylene chloride) to remove the butyloxycarbonyl-protecting group from the N-terminal amino groups of the linked peptides. The resin-bound peptides were then treated with either (i) tetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester (3–4 eq) in dry dimethylformamide containing 5% v/v diisopropylethylamine or (ii) NBD-fluoride (2–3 eq) in dry dimethylformamide, which led to the formation of resin-bound N 1-Rho or N 1-NBD peptides, respectively. After 48 h, the resins were washed thoroughly withN,N-dimethylformamide and then with methylene chloride. The peptides were then cleaved from the resins by hydrogen fluoride and finally precipitated with ether. All the peptides were purified using reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography on a C4 reversed phase Vydac column (300 Å pore size). The column was eluted in 40 min using a linear gradient of 25–80% acetonitrile in water (containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)), at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The purified peptides were shown to be homogeneous (∼99%) by analytical high performance liquid chromatography. The peptides were subjected to amino acid analysis. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by sonication of PC or PS/PC (1:1 w/w) as described previously (43Shai Y. Hadari Y.R. Finkels A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22346-22354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dry lipids were dissolved in CHCl3:MeOH (2:1 v/v). The solvents were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the lipids were resuspended in PBS buffer (at a concentration of 7.2 mg/ml) by vortex mixing. The resulting lipid dispersions were sonicated (10–30 min) in a bath-type sonicator (G1125SP1 Sonicator, Laboratory Supplies Company Inc., NY) until the turbidity had cleared. The lipid concentrations of the resulting preparations were determined by phosphorus analysis (44Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles were visualized using a JEOL JEM 100B electron microscope (Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co., Tokyo, Japan) by depositing a drop of vesicles on a carbon-coated grid and negatively staining with uranyl acetate. Examination of the grids demonstrated that the vesicles were unilamellar with an average diameter of 20–50 nm. Sendai virus (Z strain) was a generous gift of Prof. Michael Ovadia from Tel Aviv University, Israel. The virus was resuspended in buffer composed of 160 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.4, and stored at −70 °C. Human blood was obtained from a blood bank and used fresh. Prior to use, erythrocytes were washed twice with PBS, pH 7.3, and diluted to the desired concentration with the same buffer. Virions, erythrocytes, and peptides were mixed in different orders of addition and in various amounts. Briefly, peptides were added at different concentrations to virions (35 hemagglutination units) and erythrocytes (2.2%) by three different methods: (i) Peptides were added to virions suspension followed by incubation (20 or 80 min, room temperature) to enable the binding of peptides to virions. Erythrocytes were then added and the suspension further incubated for 10 min. (ii) Virions were incubated with erythrocytes in an ice bath for 30 min followed by the addition of peptides, and further incubated for 20 min. (iii) Peptides were incubated with erythrocytes for 10 min at room temperature followed by the addition of virions, and further incubated for 20 min. At the end of each one of the three experiments, final incubation was always at 37 °C for 40 min, followed by centrifugation at 5700 × g for 8 min to remove intact cells. In all assays, duplicate samples were used, and two aliquots taken from the supernatant of each sample were placed in two wells of a 96-well plate. Each experiment was repeated 2–4 times. The amount of hemoglobin released was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the wells by using a plate reader at 540 nm. Hemagglutinating activity of Sendai virus in the presence and absence of peptides was determined using fresh human RBCs in a 96-well microtiter plate by standard methods (27Nussbaum O. Zakai N. Loyter A. Virology. 1984; 138: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,45Yamada K.M. Yamada S.S. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3158-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 46Kennedy D.W. Rohrbach D.H. Martin G.R. Momoi T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 114: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In a control experiment, 100 μl of 4% RBC were added to 100 μl of Sendai virus suspension. In another control experiment the same amount of RBCs was added to solutions of SV-201, Mu1SV-201, and Mu2SV-201 in PBS (concentrations ranging from 0 to 15 μm). In the actual experiment, Sendai virions were incubated with SV-201, Mu1SV-201, Mu2SV-201, and the fusion peptide (0–15 μm each) for 80 min to allow the binding of peptides to virions, followed by the addition of 4% RBCs (100 μl) to each suspension. One hour after the addition of RBCs, the degree of agglutination was observed as described by others (45Yamada K.M. Yamada S.S. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3158-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 46Kennedy D.W. Rohrbach D.H. Martin G.R. Momoi T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 114: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The agglutinated RBCs settled in the bottom of the wells in aggregates to form a uniform carpet of cells, whereas unagglutinated RBCs formed a compact button of cells. All the experiments were done in duplicate using 2% RBCs and 35 hemagglutination units Sendai virions in a volume of 200 μl. Fluorescence emission spectra of NBD- and Rho-labeled peptides either in PBS or in the presence of lipid vesicles were recorded at room temperature on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B spectrofluorometer with the excitation monochromator set at 467 and 530 nm, respectively, with a 5–8-nm slit width. Measurements were performed in a 0.5-cm path length glass cuvette in a final reaction volume of 0.4 ml. We report the identification, synthesis, biological function, and possible site of action of a 29-residue peptide, designated SV-201, derived from a conserved region in the ectodomain of Sendai virus fusion protein (amino acids 201–229). Fig. 1 depicts the sequence, designation, and location of SV-201 in the F1 domain of the fusion protein. A possible structure of this sequence could be an amphipathic α-helix, which could be involved in the assembly of proteins in solution as well as within membranes (47Shai Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 460-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A Shiffer and Edmundson wheel projection of the 18 most conserved amino acids of SV-201 reveals that the peptide has the potential to form an amphipathic α-helical structure (Fig. 2, inner circle), in which most of the hydrophobic amino acids are segregated on one surface with the hydrophilic amino acids on the opposite surface. Indeed, CD studies showed that SV-201 has ∼70% α-helical structure in trifluoroethanol (48Ghosh, J. K., Ben-Efraim, I., Hermesh, C., Shai, Y., Abstracts of the Xth International Congress of Virology, Jerusalem, Israel, August 11–16, 1996, 1996, 166, Jerusalem, Israel.Google Scholar), a solvent which stabilizes the helical structure. Fig. 2 also shows the wheel structure of the three homologous regions of three other viruses. Interestingly, the most conserved regions face the hydrophobic surface. In addition, a net positive charge is conserved in the hydrophilic surface. The two mutant peptides, Mu1SV-201 and Mu2SV-201, served as controls (Fig. 1). In Mu1SV-201 a conserved glycine at the hydrophobic face (position 207) and a positively charged arginine in the hydrophilic face (position 205) were substituted with 2 negatively charged amino acids, rendering the peptide neutral. In Mu2SV-201, 7 amino acids at the N terminus were randomized, thus maintaining the same amino acid composition as in SV-201. The hydrophobic fusion peptide (25Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15124-15131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) served as a third control. CD experiments showed that Mu1SV-201 and Mu2SV-201 adopt 61 and 60% α-helical structure, respectively, in trifluoroethanol indicating that the mutations did not alter significantly the secondary structure. 2J. K. Ghosh and Y. Shai, unpublished results. The fusion peptide has been shown previously to adopt a predominantly α-helical structure (25Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15124-15131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides were then labeled with the fluorescent probes rhodamine and NBD to study their ability to assemble in solution and to bind phospholipid membranes. The hemolytic activity of Sendai virus is associated with fusion of the virus with target RBCs (49Loyter A. Volsky D.J. Cell Surf. Rev. 1982; 8: 215-266Google Scholar). The assay was performed as follows. Virions were initially incubated with RBCs at room temperature to allow their attachment to the cells. Subsequent incubation at 37 °C resulted in RBCs lysis. The extent of lysis was measured by absorbance at 540 nm (characteristic of hemoglobin). Fig. 3 depicts the inhibitory effect of SV-201, Mu1SV-201, Mu2SV-201, and the fusion peptide on Sendai virus-mediated hemolysis. Column A shows the absorbance measured for a control experiment in the absence of a peptide. The hemolytic activity of the Sendai virus was drastically reduced when the same amount of virions was pretreated with SV-201 (4 μm) prior to the addition of RBCs (column B). The absorbance measured was only 23% of controls, indicating 77% inhibition of Sendai virus-induced hemolytic activity. In contrast, Mu1SV-201 (4 μm, column C) and the fusion peptide (4 μm, column D) did not exhibit any inhibition activity, and Mu2SV-201 (4 μm, column E) exhibited very little inhibition. Interestingly, by changing the order of addition of peptide and virions, SV-201 lost its inhibitory effect. If RBCs were first added to virions and incubated for 30 min to permit viral attachment to the RBCs, and then SV-201 was added, no inhibition was observed (column F). Thus, SV-201 could inhibit Sendai virus-induced hemolytic activity only if interacted first with virions.Column G shows that SV-201 (4 μm) also has no inhibitory effect when incubated with RBCs before virions were added. Since ∼70% of the peptide remains free in the solution in the presence of RBCs (data not shown), the attachment of virions to RBCs is probably kinetically faster than binding of SV-201 to virions. It should be noted that the wild type, mutant, and fusion peptides had no hemolytic activity up to the maximum concentration tested (100 μm) (data not shown), thus eliminating the possibility that they contribute to the hemolytic activity during the fusion process. Overall, these results suggest that SV-201 inhibits Sendai virus-mediated hemolytic activity by interfering with some of the steps that take place during the attachment of virions to the target cells. The results of Fig. 3suggest that SV-201 can interfere with a functional domain of the Sendai virus fusion protein only when it is allowed to interact with the virions before the addition of RBCs. To search for a possible mechanism for the inhibitory effect of SV-201, hemagglutinin activity of Sendai virions was examined in the presence of the peptides. Moreover, the wild type SV-201 and the two mutants were tested for their ability to self associate, to coassemble in solution, and to bind phospholipid membranes. Sendai virus-induced hemagglutinin assay was performed in the presence and absence of the peptides to examine whether they disturb the binding of virions to target RBCs. Binding of Sendai virions to human red blood cells causes their agglutination (27Nussbaum O. Zakai N. Loyter A. Virology. 1984; 138: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,50Shimizu Y.K. Shimizu K. Ishida N. Homma M. Virology. 1976; 27: 48-60Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 51Rott R. Klenk H.O. Poste G. Nicholson G.L. Virus Infection and the Cell Surface: Cell Surface Reviews. 2. North-Holland, Amsterdam1977: 47-87Google Scholar). In a control experiment agglutination of human red blood cells was readily observed upon their incubation with virions. In another control experiment the same amount of RBCs was added to solutions of SV-201, Mu1SV-201, Mu2SV-201, and the fusion peptide in PBS (in the concentration range used for the inhibition assay) to examine whether the peptides themselves agglutinate RBCs. No hemagglutination was observed, which ruled out hemagglutinin activity of the peptides (Table I). The peptides (0–15 μm, in duplicates) were then incubated with virions for 80 min to allow their binding to the virions, followed by the addition of RBCs and incubation for 1 h. We observed that Sendai virions could agglutinate the RBCs in the presence of SV-201, Mu1SV-201, Mu2Sv-201, and the fusion peptide to the same extent observed in the absence of the peptides (Table I). These results reveal that SV-201, Mu1SV-201, Mu2SV-201, and the fusion peptide do not disturb the binding of virions to target RBCs.Table ISummary of the functional activities of SV-201 and the control peptidesSystemAgglutinationHemolysis (time dependence)Sendai virus + RBCs++SV-201 + RBCs−−Mu1SV-201 + RBCs−−Mu2SV-201 + RBCs−−Fusion peptide + RBCs−−Sendai virus + SV-201 + RBCs+− (time dependent)SV-201 + RBC + Sendai virus++Sendai virus + Mu1SV-201 + RBCs++Mu1SV-201 + RBCs + Sendai virus++Sendai virus + Mu2SV-201 + RBCs+± (not time dependent)Mu2SV-201"
https://openalex.org/W2099918326,"Abstract In eukaryotes, ribonuclease P (RNase P) requires both RNA and protein components for catalytic activity. The eukaryotic RNase P RNA, unlike its bacterial counterparts, does not possess intrinsic catalytic activity in the absence of holoenzyme protein components. We have used a sensitive photoreactive cross-linking assay to explore the substrate-binding environment for different eukaryotic RNase P holoenzymes. Protein components from the Tetrahymena thermophila and human RNase P holoenzymes form specific products in photoreactions containing [4-thio]-uridine-labeled pre-tRNAGln. The HeLa RNase P RNA in neither the presence nor the absence of holoenzyme protein components formed cross-link products to the pre-tRNAGln probe. Parallel photo-cross-linking experiments with the Escherichia coliRNase P holoenzyme revealed that only the bacterial RNase P RNA forms specific substrate photoadducts. A protein-rich active site for the eukaryotic RNase P represents one unique feature that distinguishes holoenzyme organization between bacteria and eukaryotes."

Here, the possibility that the state of GPCR phosphorylation could be affected by paracrine input was explored. We show that dopamine increased the rate of dephosphorylation of rhodopsin, the light receptor, in intact frog retinas. Further, we found that rod outer segments from dopamine-treated retinas contained increased rhodopsin phosphatase activity, indicating that this effect of dopamine on rhodopsin was mediated by stimulation of rhodopsin phosphatase. Dopamine is a ubiquitous neuromodulator and, in the retina, is released from the inner cell layers. Thus, our results identify a pathway for feedback regulation of rhodopsin from the inner retina and illustrate the involvement of dopamine in paracrine regulation of the sensitivity of a GPCR.

They have common structural elements, including seven transmembrane domains, and are regulated by many homologous mechanisms. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is therefore a central question in signal transduction. Deactivation of a GPCR involves phosphorylation of the receptor, and its subsequent resensitization requires dephosphorylation. Accordingly, the light receptor, rhodopsin, undergoes light-dependent phosphorylation and must be subsequently dephosphorylated (1Kühn H. Nature. 1974; 250: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of GPCRs is regulated typically by GPCR kinases (GRKs) and second messenger-regulated kinases, and, on the other hand, by phosphatases. GRKs preferentially phosphorylate agonist-occupied or activated GPCRs, whereas the second messenger-dependent kinases (cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C) may phosphorylate nonactivated receptors (2Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 3Hosey M.M. DebBurman S.K. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Richardson R.M. Benovic J.L. Prog. Brain Res. 1996; 109: 169-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatases that regulate GPCRs belong to the phosphatase 2A family or are dependent on Ca2+ (4Pitcher J.A. Payne E.S. Csortos C.

The kinases and phosphatases that affect the phosphorylation of GPCRs may in turn be regulated. Most obviously, second messenger-regulated kinases may mediate input from different signal transduction pathways (9Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 10Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 11Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). GRKs can also be regulated by other pathways (12Stoffel III, R.H. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) activity, for example, is inhibited by the Ca2+-binding protein, recoverin, when Ca2+levels are high (13Kawamura S. Nature. 1993; 362: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). β-Adrenergic receptor kinase (GRK2) and GRK5 are both phosphorylated by the second messenger kinase, protein kinase C, resulting in their activation (14Chuang T.T.

Less is known about the dephosphorylation of GPCRs and the regulation of their phosphatases, although rhodopsin dephosphorylation appears to be affected by Ca2+ levels. Bovine rhodopsin can be dephosphorylated by a phosphatase 2A (5Palczewski K. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. Ingebritsen T.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Fowles C. Akhtar M. Cohen P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9385-9391Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and by a Ca2+-sensitive phosphatase (7Kutuzov M.A. Bennett N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), both of which are present in photoreceptor outer segments. In Drosophila, rhodopsin is dephosphorylated by the rdgC protein, which possesses a putative Ca2+-binding domain in addition to a phosphatase catalytic domain (8Vinos J. Jalink K. Hardy R.W. Britt S.G. Zuker C.S. Science. 1997; 277: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Steele F.R. Washburn T. Rieger R. O'Tousa J.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 669-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Regulation of kinases and phosphatases thus provides upstream mechanisms for modulating GPCRs. The focus of the present study was on whether input from the inner retina could affect the phosphorylation state of rhodopsin. Such input could potentially originate from general light- or dark-adaptive signals or from a circadian oscillator. The most likely candidate for an intercellular messenger is the major catecholamine in retina, dopamine. Amacrine and interplexiform cells in the inner retina release dopamine in response to light and under the control of a circadian clock (18Iuvone P.M. Galli C.L. Garrison-Gund C.K. Neff N.H.

We demonstrate here that dopamine feedback to the photoreceptor cells affects the kinetics of rhodopsin dephosphorylation in intact frog retinas, indicating that the light receptor can be regulated by paracrine input. Dopamine hydrochloride, R(+)-SCH-23390 hydrochloride, and spiperone hydrochloride were purchased from Research Biochemicals International, Inc. [32P]Orthophosphoric acid (∼9,000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Northern grass frogs (Rana pipiens) weighing 20–30 g were purchased from Carolina Biological Supply Co. and treated according to NIH and University of California at San Diego animal care guidelines. The procedure for incubation of retinas and analysis of rhodopsin phosphorylation followed that described previously (27Udovichenko I.P. Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7952-7959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Retinas were removed from dark-adapted animals. Each intact retina was incubated under dim red light in 1 ml of amphibian culture medium (35 mm NaHCO3, 75 mmNaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.3, 10 μg/ml phenol red, 1 mg/ml casamino acids, 10 mmβ-d(+)-glucose, 0.1 mg/ml Na-l-ascorbate, and 20 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate) for 2 h and then for 10 min with or without receptor ligands. One retina from each frog served as the experimental, and the other served as the control. Retinas were illuminated by a calibrated flash of light that photoexcited 6 ± 3 or 80 ± 6% of the rhodopsin (27Udovichenko I.P. Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7952-7959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and then incubated up to 1 h under dim red light. All incubations were carried out at 22–23 °C. The specific32P incorporation into rhodopsin was determined after SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained and radioactive (PhosphorImager) bands and expressed in relative units per constant amount of rhodopsin. Three methods were used for preparation of rhodopsin samples: Method 1, at the end of the incubation period, 250 μl of buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.3) was added to each retina. Rod outer segments (ROSs) were detached from the rest of the retina by vortexing for 10 s. After allowing the retina remnants to settle for 2 min on ice, the ROS-enriched fraction was removed and centrifuged for 30 s at 16,000 × g. The pellet (crude ROSs) was suspended in 100 μl of 1% SDS at room temperature and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 20 min, room temperature) to remove debris, before adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer; Method 2, the crude ROSs from Method 1 were purified further by sucrose gradient centrifugation (28Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar); and Method 3, reactions of rhodopsin phosphorylation in intact retinas were stopped by adding 250 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid, and the total retinal proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. In all three methods, each rhodopsin fraction from an individual retina in SDS-PAGE sample buffer was divided into two portions. One was heated at 100 °C for 15 min, and the other was kept at room temperature. Heating in SDS promotes the oligomerization of rhodopsin, so that rhodopsin no longer migrates with an apparent molecular mass of ∼36 kDa in the gel. The heated sample was therefore used to measure protein and radioactivity that was not from rhodopsin in this area (∼36 kDa) of the gel. This background was subtracted from the data obtained from lanes with samples that were not heated. Peripherin/rds, for example, is a photoreceptor outer segment phosphoprotein (29Boesze-Battaglia K. Kong F. Lamba O.P. Stefano F.P. Williams D.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6835-6846Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that has a similar apparent molecular mass. We confirmed by Western blot analysis that bovine peripherin/rds does not oligomerize under the conditions used in the present experiments. Purified ROSs (Method 2, above) from dopamine-treated and control retinas were collected from a sucrose gradient (50 μl), and 10-μl aliquots were suspended in 90 μl of buffer B (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.3, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.05% digitonin). The samples were precipitated with MeOH (90%, 30 min, ice) and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Each supernatant was lyophilized and then resuspended in 10 μl of water. A 1-μl aliquot was loaded on to a Cellulose polyethyleneimine TLC plate (8 × 8 cm). Stepwise chromatography was run in the first direction with 0.2 (1 min), 1 (3 min), and 1.6 m LiCl (10 min). The LiCl was removed by washing the plates in MeOH (15 min). Dry plates were used for stepwise chromatography in the second direction with 0.5 (0.5 min), 2 (1 min), and 4 m sodium formate (8 min) (pH 3.4) (30Mangold H. Stahl E. Thin-Layer Chromatography: A Laboratory Handbook. Topan Co., Tokyo1969: 792-802Google Scholar). Radioactivity was quantified using a PhosphorImager. 32P phosphorylation of rhodopsin was performed in intact retinas as above. Rod outer segments from dopamine-treated and control retinas were purified as described (Method 2, above), and their cytosolic fractions (0.6 mg/ml) were used to assay phosphatase activity (1 nmrhodopsin; 22 °C for 30 min, during which time32P release was linear) (7Kutuzov M.A. Bennett N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Azarian S.M. King A.J. Hallett M.A. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24375-24384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Radioactive products were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by a PhosphorImager. Paired Student's t tests were performed to determine the probability (p) of no significant difference. After retinas were exposed to a flash of light, rhodopsin was phosphorylated, reaching maximal phosphorylation level after 10 min (27Udovichenko I.P. Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7952-7959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The rate of phosphorylation in control retinas and in retinas exposed to 100 μm exogenous dopamine was similar (Fig. 1). After 30 min, the level of rhodopsin phosphorylation decreased, with rhodopsin in the dopamine-treated retinas dephosphorylated at a faster rate. By 45 min after the light flash, the level of phosphorylation of rhodopsin in dopamine-treated retinas was only 50% that in control retinas (Fig. 1). A similar result was obtained by three different procedures of sample preparation, as described under “Experimental Procedures”; results from Method 1 are illustrated in Fig. 1. Moreover, this result was found irrespective of whether 80 or 6% of the rhodopsin was photoexcited by the flash (Fig. 2).Figure 2Dopamine has the same effect on the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of rhodopsin at two levels of flash intensity. Retinas were exposed to a flash of light that excited either 6 or 80% of rhodopsin. The state of rhodopsin phosphorylation was determined from crude ROSs (Method 1). There was no significant difference (NS) between 1 μmdopamine-treated and control samples 15 min after a flash of either intensity. However, 45 min after either flash, rhodopsin in dopamine-treated retinas contained ∼50% less phosphate. Data represent the means ± S.E. and were pooled from six retinas from four different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether or not the effect of dopamine resulted in a general effect on ROS protein phosphorylation, we carried out two tests. First, the amount of [32P]ATP was measured in ROSs following incubation of retinas for 45 min in the presence or the absence of dopamine. PhosphorImager analysis of two-dimensional TLC plates showed that in dopamine-treated retinas the amount of ROS [32P]ATP was similar to that in control retinas (102 ± 7%; n = 12; p = 0.94). Second, we observed that the radioactivity of minor phosphoproteins was unaffected by dopamine (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with dopamine having a specific effect on the phosphorylation state of rhodopsin. Further analysis of the reduction in the level of rhodopsin phosphorylation 45 min after the flash showed that it was effected by nanomolar concentrations of exogenous dopamine (Fig. 4). These concentrations are in the range of reported dissociation constants (Kd) for dopamine receptors in the high affinity state (32Seeman P. Van Tol H.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 264-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Dopamine receptors fall into two general classes, D1-like and D2-like. D1 receptors act by activating adenylate cyclase. D2 receptors typically act by inhibiting adenylate cyclase (32Seeman P. Van Tol H.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 264-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 33Sibley D.R. Monsma Jr., F.J. Shen Y. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1993; 35: 391-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 34Ogawa N. Acta Med. Okayama. 1995; 49: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). To test which class of receptor might be involved in mediating the dopamine effect on rhodopsin phosphorylation, we tested whether antagonists selective for D1-like or D2-like receptors would counter the lowered phosphorylation level found 45 min after the light flash. As illustrated in Fig. 5, SCH-23390, a selective D1 antagonist, did not interfere with the dopamine effect. However, spiperone, a selective D2 antagonist, did; it resulted in a higher level of phosphorylation. This finding is consistent with previous reports identifying D2-like receptors on rod photoreceptors (20Brann M.R. Young III., W.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1986; 69: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Dearry A. Falardeau P. Shores C. Caron M.G. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 11: 437-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Tran V.T. Dickman M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1992; 33: 1620-1626PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wagner H.J. Luo B.G. Ariano M.A. Sibley D.R. Stell W.K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 331: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results indicate that exposure to dopamine and activation of D2 receptors on photoreceptor cells alters the kinetics of rhodopsin dephosphorylation. One explanation is that dopamine leads to activation of rhodopsin phosphatases. Alternatively, dopamine could lead to preferential phosphorylation at a site that is dephosphorylated more rapidly. Protein kinase C phosphorylates a domain that is not a primary phosphorylation site for rhodopsin kinase (38Greene N.M. Williams D.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6710-6717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 39Greene N.M. Williams D.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10341-10344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and stimulation of protein kinase C phosphorylation of rhodopsin results in faster dephosphorylation (27Udovichenko I.P. Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7952-7959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, altering the relative activities of protein kinase C and rhodopsin kinase results in a different rate of phosphorylation (27Udovichenko I.P. Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7952-7959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which was not evident in dopamine-treated samples (Fig. 1). In experiments to test whether ROSs from dopamine-treated retinas contained greater phosphatase activity, purified ROS membranes containing32P-phosphorylated rhodopsin were incubated with ROS cytosol from control or dopamine-treated retinas (7Kutuzov M.A. Bennett N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Azarian S.M. King A.J. Hallett M.A. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24375-24384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 illustrates that dopamine-treated ROS cytosol contained significantly more rhodopsin phosphatase activity. Previous work has shown that dopamine may regulate phosphatase-1 via D1 receptors and cyclic AMP-dependent kinase phosphorylation of DARPP-32 (dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein), a phosphatase-1 inhibitor (40Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Tung H.Y. Cohen P. Nature. 1984; 310: 503-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). However, this is the first report suggesting an effect of dopamine on other phosphatases and on phosphatase activity via D2 receptors. Dephosphorylation of GPCRs has received less attention than their phosphorylation. In comparison to our knowledge of kinases that phosphorylate GPCRs, less is known about the phosphatases that dephosphorylate them, and, in particular, how these phosphatases are regulated. However, dephosphorylation of rhodopsin is necessary to complete the rhodopsin cycle following light activation and then deactivation by phosphorylation and arrestin binding (41Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1986; 9: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 42Yarfitz S. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14329-14332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The importance of rhodopsin dephosphorylation is emphasized byDrosophila rdgC mutants. In the absence of rhodopsin phosphatase (the product of the rdgC gene), the phosphorylation state of rhodopsin is abnormally high, termination of the light response is defective, and the photoreceptor cells degenerate (8Vinos J. Jalink K. Hardy R.W. Britt S.G. Zuker C.S. Science. 1997; 277: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate a role for dopamine in the regulation of rhodopsin dephosphorylation and indeed suggest that it effects stimulation of rhodopsin phosphatase. Because dopamine is normally released by cells in the inner retina, these results identify the potential for a novel means of regulation of rhodopsin: from the inner retina back to the light receptor."
