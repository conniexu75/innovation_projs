https://openalex.org/W2931349,"Prior studies to this article by Anfinsen, Epstein, and Goldberger established that the time required for synthesizing a chain
 of protein such as ribonuclease in the tissues of higher organisms would be approximately two minutes. Here, the three researchers
 noted that an enzyme system in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells that catalyzed the disulfide interchange reaction and which,
 when added to solutions of reduced ribonuclease, catalyzed the rapid formation of the native disulfide pairing in a period
 less than two minutes. Subsequent studies would find that such motile proteins as staphylococcal nuclease or myoglobin could
 undergo virtually complete renaturation in only a few seconds or less."

https://openalex.org/W2070011714,Focal electroencephalographic discharges in lesions of cortex induced by freezing are associated with prolonged membrane depolarizations and hyperpolarizations in neurons located at various depths in the lesion sites. Transmembrane potential changes have properties similar to those of postsynaptic potentials. The temporal relationship between intracellular potentials and paroxysmal discharges indicates that the latter are extracellularly recorded summations of synchronously developing depolarizations and hyperpolarizations in complex synaptic organizations of neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2074759449,"The deposition of liver glycogen in starved rats given a single dose of cortisone is inhibited by puromycin and actinomycin. The former agent interferes with induced enzyme formation in general, and the latter with the cortisone-induced rise in liver enzyme levels. The results suggest that the regulatory eJffect of cortisone on carbohydrate metabolism may be brought about -by its action on the cellular concentration of certain enzyme proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1975002417,"FROM previous work1,2 it is known that egg albumen, in common with other protein solutions, exhibits dielectric dispersion at megacycle frequencies and microwave frequencies due to the relaxation of the protein and water molecules, respectively. The measurements recorded here, however, indicate that there is another small dispersion region occurring at tens and hundreds of megacycles between the two main regions which is similar to the effect reported by Schwan3 for the case of hæmoglobin."

Naturalistic observations of ground- and hole-nesting duck species, augmented by sound amplification equipment, indicate that hatchlings are exposed to the call of their mother for a relatively long period before they are exposed to the sight of her."

https://openalex.org/W2017408735,"Peptic digestion of fraction III from papain-digested rabbit serum gamma-globulin produces a variety of smaller fragments. Some are too large to pass through a dialysis bag, and these retain the capacity to precipitate with antiserum to rabbit gamma-globulin. Others pass through the bag and fail to precipitate with antibody, but they can inhibit the precipitation of antibody with fraction III. This indicates that antigenic determinants of the gamma-globulin molecule are carried in these fragments."
https://openalex.org/W2053313495,"A variant of reovirus 3, Dearing strain, isolated after repeated pdssage of the original Dearing virus in L cells, is similar to the parent virus in many ways. It is, however, less sensitive to specific antibodies and metabolic inhibitors, and is released from L cells to a lesser extent than the original virus. Calculated as moles per 100 moles of total base in RNA, the percentage of guanine is 20.2, adenine, 29.8, cytosine, 21.0, and uracil 29.1. These values closely approximate those reported previously for the parent virus."

https://openalex.org/W1994425457,"CLINICAL and pathological observations on Chinese hamsters (Cricetulus griseus) with spontaneous hereditary diabetes mellitus have been reported previously in several papers1–7. Generally speaking, the disease in Chinese hamsters is primarily pancreatogenic, with degranulation, hydropic degeneration and deficiency of β-cells. Other forms of pathological expression noted in symptomatic animals are glomerulosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, increased periodontal breakdown, and proneness toward the formation of adenocarcinomas of the pancreas."

https://openalex.org/W2018988680,Proteolytic activity accompanies myosin through three reprecipitations. The fact that this activity can be potentiated by very small doses of 1-adrenaline supports the view that adrenaline receptors are protein in nature and that adrenaline-like compounds exert their action through modification of the activity of enzymes.
https://openalex.org/W2056200934,"Stevens' terminal brightness function, an adaptation curve derived from power law data, closely agrees with Troland's just-noticeable-difference (jnd) summation for brightness. The power law itself describes sensation magnitude before adaptation to a test stimulus, whereas the Fechnerian discriminability law describes sensation magnitude after adaptation. This suggests their synthesis in a more general psychophysical equation."
https://openalex.org/W2060294461,"Over the past centuries physiology has weathered a series of revolutions generated by the introduction of powerful tools and concepts from other disciplines, notably physics and chemistry. On each occasion such infusion of new ideas has enormously strengthened and enriched physiology. Today, the introduction of tools and concepts from engineering promises another revolution with another strengthening and enrichment. Among the things engineering has to offer are some that are close to the heart of physiology. These must be adapted and thoroughly integrated into the body of physiological concepts, attitudes, and operations. This goal presents a challenge which physiologists cannot afford to ignore. It calls for an ""operation bootstrap"" on the part of those of us long past our student days. It will entail a changing pattern of undergraduate preparation and graduate education for those who will become the physiologists of the coming generation. But a welcoming of the challenge and an encouragement of efforts to meet it will transform this opportunity, as others have been transformed, into another revolutionary advance in physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2082753138,"IN 1954 it was suggested by Green1 that normal cells contain an antigen which is absent from tumour cells, and that, in the presence of an ‘auto-immune’ reaction in which carcinogenic substances behave as haptenes, the tumour cells have a selective survival advantage. Loss of tissue-specific antigen has been demonstrated in the cells of experimental tumours of hamster kidney2,3 and rat liver2,3, and spontaneous tumours of humanskin3 and gastro-intestinal tract4 by the use of heterologous antibodies. Recently it has been shown that some cells of most tumours of the human thyroid appear to be deficient in a thyroid-specific auto-antigen which is present in the epithelial cells of normal and hyperplastic thyroids; primary explants of thyroid cells in tissue culture were used and the antigenicity of the cells was demonstrated by their susceptibility to the cytotoxic effects of a naturally occurring thyroid-specific auto-antibody6 frequently found in the serum of patients with chronic thyroiditis."

In keeping with theoretical expectations theresults showed that when the different inverted and reversed feedback conditions could be performed, the response to the inverted feedback condition wasthe poorest, while that to the reversed condition was the most effective."

Specifically, for each of the 20 amino-acids, published data list at least one trinucleotide believed to incorporate it in the protein synthesis machinery of E. coli. Surprisingly, in each of these published code-words, the symbol U (uracil) occurs in at least one of the three positions."

https://openalex.org/W1979828343,THE concept of tendermindedness has been at the centre of a controversy ever since Eysenck1 attempted to relate it to political attitudes. First Christie2 then Hanley and Rokeach3 sought to discredit the ideas put forward by Eysenck. To some extent the issue has been difficult to settle because there has been no external criterion against which T could be validated. Until now it has been open to whatever interpretation the various parties have cared to place on it. Nor has the scale at present used by Eysenck to measure T ever been factor analysed.
