https://openalex.org/W2040587515,"The history and methods of membrane protein crystallization are described. The solution of the structure of the photosynthetic reaction center from the bacterium Rhodopseudomonas viridis is described, and the structure of this membrane protein complex is correlated with its function as a light-driven electron pump across the photosynthetic membrane. Conclusions about the structure of the photosystem II reaction center from plants are drawn, and aspects of membrane protein structure are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2035185762,"During the 1960s there was extensive formation of anchor ice to depths of 30 meters at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. During this period the sponge Homaxinella balfourensis was rare, as were its predators in that depth zone. Most of the existing sponges were killed by anchor ice. During the 1970s, anchor ice formation was reduced, and there was a massive recruitment of Homaxinella, which covered as much as 80 percent of the substrata in that zone. Many predators appeared but did not control the sponge population, and it continued to grow through that decade. The early 1980s were characterized by ice formation and almost all of the Homaxinella were eliminated, leaving an order of magnitude more predators in that zone. The interdecadal increases in anchor ice probably result from local upwelling of extremely cold deep water, possibly in response to shifts in the strengths of regional currents."
https://openalex.org/W2068191988,"An empirical model describing the diffusion kinetics of oxygen in silicate minerals under hydrothermal conditions has been established for temperatures between 773 and 1073 Kelvin at 100 megapascals of water pressure. The equation, log D = alpha + (beta/T) + [(gamma + (delta/T))Z], where D is the diffusion coefficient, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta are constants, T is the Kelvin temperature, and Z is the total ionic porosity, may be used to predict diffusion coefficients, in most cases to within the reported experimental reproducibility of a factor of 2. For oxygen diffusion, alpha = -2, beta = -3.4 x 10(4)K, gamma = -0.13, and delta = 6.4 x 10(2)K, for D in square centimeters per second. Limited data for the diffusion of argon in silicates suggest that the model describes this system as well."
https://openalex.org/W2000414042,"The Great Basin of the western United States has proven important for studies of Proterozoic and Paleozoic geology [2500 to 245 million years ago (Ma)] and has been central to the development of ideas about the mechanics of crustal shortening and extension. An understanding of the deformational history of this region during Mesozoic and Cenozoic time (245 Ma to the present) is required for palinspastic reconstruction of now isolated exposures of older geology in order to place these in an appropriate regional geographic context. Considerable advances in unraveling both the crustal shortening that took place during Mesozoic to early Cenozoic time (especially from about 150 to 50 Ma) and the extension of the past 37 million years have shown that earlier reconstructions need to be revised significantly. A new reconstruction is developed for rocks of middle Proterozoic to Early Cambrian age based on evidence that total shortening by generally east-vergent thrusts and folds was at least 104 to 135 kilometers and that the Great Basin as a whole accommodated ∼250 kilometers of extension in the direction 287° ± 12° between the Colorado Plateau and the Sierra Nevada. Extension is assumed to be equivalent at all latitudes because available paleomagnetic evidence suggests that the Sierra Nevada experienced little or no rotation with respect to the extension direction since the late Mesozoic. An estimate of the uncertainty in the amount of extension obtained from geological and paleomagnetic uncertainties increases northward from ±56 kilometers at 36°30′N to -87+108 kilometers at 40°N. On the basis of the reconstruction, the original width of the preserved part of the late Proterozoic and Early Cambrian basin was about 150 to 300 kilometers, about 60 percent of the present width, and the basin was oriented slightly more north-south with respect to present-day coordinates."

https://openalex.org/W1988770956,"Any time the view of a planet leaps from a fuzzy dot accompanied by two pinpoints of light to the riveting details of swirling clouds, rings, cratered moonlets, and even individual dust particles, planetary science is going to be in for some upheaval. Voyager 2's encounter with Neptune was no exception. Something as seemingly innocuous as an hour or two shift in the new length of a Neptunian day is giving meteorologists and physicists fits. And Neptune's canted, complex magnetic field found by Voyager knocks into a cocked hat most ideas about why a similar field at Uranus was unique. But there were more reassuring discoveries as well. Here are samplings of both sorts of findings."
