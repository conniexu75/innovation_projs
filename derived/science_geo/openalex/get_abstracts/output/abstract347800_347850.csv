https://openalex.org/W2140008727,"Constitutive egress of bone marrow (BM)-resident hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) into the blood is a well-established phenomenon, but the ultimate fate and functional relevance of circulating HSPCs is largely unknown. We show that mouse thoracic duct (TD) lymph contains HSPCs that possess short- and long-term multilineage reconstitution capacity. TD-derived HSPCs originate in the BM, enter the blood, and traffic to multiple peripheral organs, where they reside for at least 36 hr before entering draining lymphatics to return to the blood and, eventually, the BM. HSPC egress from extramedullary tissues into lymph depends on sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. Migratory HSPCs proliferate within extramedullary tissues and give rise to tissue-resident myeloid cells, preferentially dendritic cells. HSPC differentiation is amplified upon exposure to Toll-like receptor agonists. Thus, HSPCs can survey peripheral organs and can foster the local production of tissue-resident innate immune cells under both steady-state conditions and in response to inflammatory signals."

Here we describe a nonapoptotic cell death program in matrix-detached cells that is initiated by a previously unrecognized and unusual process involving the invasion of one cell into another, leading to a transient state in which a live cell is contained within a neighboring host cell. Live internalized cells are either degraded by lysosomal enzymes or released. We term this cell internalization process entosis and present evidence for entosis as a mechanism underlying the commonly observed “cell-in-cell” cytological feature in human cancers. Further we propose that entosis is driven by compaction force associated with adherens junction formation in the absence of integrin engagement and may represent an intrinsic tumor suppression mechanism for cells that are detached from ECM.

In multicellular organisms, cell proliferation and cell death are carefully coordinated to control the number and organization of cells in tissues and organs. In humans, an imbalance in these processes can result in diseases such as cancer that arises from the accumulation of cells due to hyperproliferation and reduced cell death. Much attention has been focused on apoptosis as a critical cell death mechanism due to its central role in cell clearance during development and also in tumor suppression (Jacobson et al., 1997Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Programmed cell death in animal development.Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar). However, increasing evidence indicates that nonapoptotic cell death processes are also important physiological modes of cell death (Lockshin and Zakeri, 2004Lockshin R.A. Zakeri Z. Caspase-independent cell death?.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2766-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Nonapoptotic death mechanisms can occur concomitantly with apoptosis or can function as alternative processes when apoptosis is impaired to mediate such important developmental processes as interdigital cell death and hollowing of the mammary ducts during puberty (Chautan et al., 1999Chautan M.

Cell. 2007; 12: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Within the mammary gland, an important regulator of epithelial cell survival is attachment to a protein-rich basement membrane or extracellular matrix (ECM). Cell death induced by detachment from ECM functions as a luminal clearing mechanism during development (Mailleux et al., 2007Mailleux A.A. Overholtzer M. Schmelzle T. Bouillet P. Strasser A. Brugge J.S. BIM regulates apoptosis during mammary ductal morphogenesis, and its absence reveals alternative cell death mechanisms.Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and also may function as a barrier to the development of carcinomas, which display luminal filling as a hallmark. One form of detachment-induced death is an apoptotic program termed anoikis that has been characterized in suspension cell cultures (Frisch and Francis, 1994Frisch S.M. Francis H. Disruption of epithelial cell-matrix interactions induces apoptosis.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2664) Google Scholar, Meredith et al., 1993Meredith Jr., J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. The extracellular matrix as a cell survival factor.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Although anoikis likely acts as a barrier to tumor formation or metastasis, its inhibition is unlikely to be sufficient for long-term survival of tumor cells away from ECM, as we have found that nonapoptotic cell clearance mechanisms can compensate for apoptotic defects in detached cell populations (Debnath et al., 2002Debnath J. Mills K.R. Collins N.L. Reginato M.J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S.

Cell. 2007; 12: 221-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, tumors arising in glandular epithelia, such as breast tumors, that display filling of luminal spaces as a hallmark must likely overcome both apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell death programs for long-term survival in the absence of attachment to the basement membrane. Here we describe a nonapoptotic cell death process that occurs in human tumors and that is provoked by loss of attachment to matrix. This cell death mechanism is initiated by an unusual process involving the invasion of one live cell into another, followed by the degradation of internalized cells by lysosomal enzymes. We term this cell internalization process entosis and provide evidence for entosis in human tumors as a mechanism underlying the “cell-in-cell” or “cannibalism” cytological feature. In tracking the fate of human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells in suspension cultures, we noted that some cells in small aggregates appeared to be inside of large vacuoles, suggesting that they were internalized within a neighboring cell (Figure S1). To further investigate these structures, cells were labeled with green or red fluorescent CellTracker dyes and mixed together in suspension. Internalized cells highlighted by these dyes were observed as early as 6 hr in suspension (Figure 1Aa). Analysis by confocal microscopy demonstrated the complete internalization of one cell within another (Figure 1Ab and Movie S1A) or, in some cases, one cell within a cell that was within a third cell (Figures 1Ac and 1Ad). Cell internalization was also analyzed by immunostaining cytospin preparations of suspended cultures for β-catenin to highlight the plasma membrane. Internalizing cells were observed by 6 hr and comprised approximately 25% of the culture by 12 hr (Figure 1C). To further examine whether cells could be completely internalized into their neighbors, suspended cells were assayed for protection from surface biotinylation. After 12 hr, 18.5% ± 2% of internalizing cells (determined by β-catenin staining) were protected from surface labeling with biotin, indicating their complete internalization (Figure S2). To examine this process in real time, MCF10A cells in suspension were analyzed by time-lapse microscopy. Cell internalization was initiated approximately 3–6 hr after detachment and took several hours to complete (Figure 1B and Movies S1B and S1C). In some cases, complex structures resulting from several reiterative internalization events were formed (Figure 1Bb), and some cells appeared to reside in a large vacuole following internalization (Figures 1B and S1). Internalizing cells appeared to be viable and to bore into outer cells, suggesting that this process might involve the active invasion of one cell into another (see Movies S1B and S1C). Ultrastructural analysis of engulfed cells from 6 hr suspension cultures did not reveal evidence of apoptotic or necrotic features (Figure 1Ae), and internalizing cells appeared to retain mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure S3). Recently it was reported that mouse mammary epithelial cells have phagocytic activity toward apoptotic cells (Monks et al., 2005Monks J. Rosner D. Geske F.J. Lehman L. Hanson L. Neville M.C. Fadok V.A. Epithelial cells as phagocytes: apoptotic epithelial cells are engulfed by mammary alveolar epithelial cells and repress inflammatory mediator release.Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To examine whether internalization of MCF10A cells following matrix detachment could be a phagocytic response to an apoptotic program, we first tested whether this process was associated with caspase activation. Apoptosis and cell engulfment were quantified by staining suspended cells for activated caspase-3 and β-catenin. Whereas internalizing cells comprised ∼25% of the culture by 12 hr, the percentage of cells with activated caspase-3 did not increase until after 24 hr in suspension (Figure 1C). The overexpression of Bcl2 or treatment of cells with the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK also had no effect on cell internalization even though either could inhibit the activation of caspase-3 in suspension or apoptosis following exposure of monolayer cells to UV irradiation (Figures 1C and 1D). Suspension cultures were further examined for phosphatydilserine (PS) exposure, an eat-me signal that activates phagocytosis of dying cells (Fadok et al., 1992Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. Exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic lymphocytes triggers specific recognition and removal by macrophages.J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar, Fadok et al., 2000Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A. Henson P.M. A receptor for phosphatidylserine-specific clearance of apoptotic cells.Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), by labeling with a fluorescently tagged Annexin V protein that binds to PS. A population of Annexin V-positive cells was detected at early time points in suspension, i.e., 6 and 12 hr; however, the percentages of Annexin positivity (5%–10%) remained much lower than those of cell internalization at these times (15%–25%) (Figure 1E), and there were no partially internalized cells that were positive for Annexin staining (Figure 1E). The addition of PS-liposomes, which can inhibit phagocytosis by overwhelming the PSR (Fadok et al., 1992Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. Exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic lymphocytes triggers specific recognition and removal by macrophages.J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar), also had no effect on cell internalization although they inhibited the uptake of apoptotic Jurkat cells by J774 mouse macrophages (Figure 1F). We also did not observe any engulfment when MCF10A monolayers were incubated with apoptotic Jurkat cells, suggesting that MCF10A cells cannot readily phagocytize apoptotic cells (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that cell engulfment of MCF10A cells in suspension cultures is not regulated by apoptotic processes and therefore is distinct from phagocytic clearance mechanisms of dying cells. To examine whether actin polymerization or myosin II contraction are required for cell engulfment, cells were treated with latrunculin B (LatB), an inhibitor of actin polymerization, or blebbistatin, a myosin II inhibitor. LatB- and blebbistatin-treated cells aggregated into clumps in suspension but rarely internalized, demonstrating a role for actin polymerization and myosin II in cell engulfment (Figure 2A). We next examined whether Rho signaling, which is a critical regulator of actin and myosin II, also plays a role in this process. Rho GTPases, and their downstream effectors ROCK1 and ROCK2, were inhibited by treatment with Tat-C3, a cell-permeable Rho GTPase inhibitor (Sauzeau et al., 2001Sauzeau V. Le Mellionnec E. Bertoglio J. Scalbert E. Pacaud P. Loirand G. Human urotensin II-induced contraction and arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation are mediated by RhoA and Rho-kinase.Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1102-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, Sekine et al., 1989Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. Asparagine residue in the rho gene product is the modification site for botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Y-27632 and H-1152, two structurally distinct inhibitors of ROCK proteins (Uehata et al., 1997Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Calcium sensitization of smooth muscle mediated by a Rho-associated protein kinase in hypertension.Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar). Inhibition of either Rho or ROCK suppressed cell engulfment in suspended cultures (Figure 2A). Similar to LatB-treated cells, Rho- and ROCK-inhibited cells were able to aggregate but rarely internalized (Figures 2A and 2B and Movies S2A and S2B). These data implicate the Rho-ROCK-actin/myosin pathway as an important regulator of engulfment in suspension. To determine whether cell internalization requires specific ROCK isoforms, ROCK1 and 2 expression were downregulated with short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Figure 2Ca). Downregulation of either ROCK1 or ROCK2 alone had only a minimal effect on the morphology of cells in monolayer culture; however, downregulation of both isoforms together reduced cell spreading and significantly altered cell morphology similarly to Y-27632 treatment (Figure 2Ca and data not shown). Similarly, ROCK1 and ROCK2 downregulation had an additive effect on cell internalization, as the knockdown of both isoforms together inhibited internalization by approximately 3-fold compared to the less-than 2-fold effect of either isoform alone (Figure 2Cb). To further probe the role of the Rho pathway we examined whether Rho or ROCK were required in internalizing cells or outer cells. CellTracker Red-labeled cells were pretreated with either Tat-C3 or ROCK1 and 2 siRNAs, mixed with untreated green-labeled control cells, and analyzed by confocal microscopy after 6 hr in suspension. Whereas engulfment was equally distributed between red- and green-labeled cells in control cultures, Rho- or ROCK-inhibited, red-labeled cells were rarely internalized into control green cells yet were able to function as outer cells to the same extent as controls (Figure 2Cc). Thus, the Rho pathway is specifically required in internalizing cells and not in outer cells. These data demonstrate that internalizing cells actively participate in this process in a Rho- and ROCK-dependent manner. Given these unique features that distinguish this cell internalization process from phagocytic cell engulfment, we refer to this cell internalization process as entosis, after the Greek word entos, which means inside, into, or within. To determine if cells other than MCF10A undergo entosis, a panel of human cell lines was tested in suspension culture (Table S1). Cell engulfment was observed in a variety of nontumorigenic cell lines of various types and in four of nine tumor cell lines examined (Table S1). Among the tumor cell lines, MCF7 displayed the highest percentage (30%), and like MCF10A, internalization of these cells was dependent on ROCK and myosin II, and Rho was specifically required in internalizing cells and not in outer cells (Figure S4). Because epithelial cells form adherens junctions when cultured in suspension (Adams et al., 1998Adams C.L. Chen Y.T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. Mechanisms of epithelial cell-cell adhesion and cell compaction revealed by high-resolution tracking of E-cadherin-green fluorescent protein.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1105-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, Wrobel et al., 2004Wrobel C.N. Debnath J. Lin E. Beausoleil S. Roussel M.F. Brugge J.S. Autocrine CSF-1R activation promotes Src-dependent disruption of mammary epithelial architecture.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and cells in our time-lapse analysis appeared to establish cell-cell junctions prior to internalizing (Figure 1B and Movies S1B and S1C), we examined whether cadherin-mediated adhesion is required for entosis. Cadherin proteins require calcium for binding activity and thus junctions can be blocked by chelating calcium from culture medium. The addition of either EGTA (chelates Ca2+) or EDTA (chelates Ca2+ and Mg2+) to suspension cultures strongly inhibited both aggregate formation and cell internalization of MCF7 and MCF10A cells (Figures 3Aa–3Ac), demonstrating a requirement for calcium-dependent processes. To examine a requirement for cadherins more directly, cadherin-blocking antibodies were added to suspension cultures. Entosis of MCF7 cells was inhibited by the addition of an E-cadherin blocking antibody to almost the same extent as chelating calcium (Figure 3Aa), and like calcium chelation, blocking E-cadherin decreased cell aggregation (Figure S5). For MCF10A cells, which unlike MCF7 express high levels of both E- and P-cadherin (Figure S6), blocking E-cadherin alone had no effect, but a combination of E- and P-cadherin blocking antibodies inhibited cell internalization by approximately 2-fold (Figure 3Ab). These data demonstrate a requirement for adherens junctions to initiate entosis in suspension cultures. Suspension cultures were immunostained for E-cadherin and β-catenin to visualize cell junctions during entosis. By 6 hr after matrix detachment, many interacting cells displayed characteristic adherens junctions, with increased staining of E-cadherin and β-catenin at cell interfaces and dense plaques of these proteins at the points of maximum width between cells (Figure 3Ba), similar to what is described for epithelial cells undergoing compaction in a monolayer (Adams et al., 1998Adams C.L. Chen Y.T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. Mechanisms of epithelial cell-cell adhesion and cell compaction revealed by high-resolution tracking of E-cadherin-green fluorescent protein.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1105-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). For cells that were undergoing entosis, the extent of internalization was also tracked by increased intensity of E-cadherin and β-catenin staining and plaques at the terminal-most points of interaction between the inner and outer cells (Figures 3Bb–3Bd). These staining patterns suggest that the mechanism of entosis is directly linked to cell-cell compaction. TEM analysis showed that the closest contact between paired cells of engulfment intermediates was at the extreme end of finger-like projections of the receiving cell (Figure 3Ca), and many such sites contained characteristic adherens junctions (Figures 3Ca and 3Cb). Additionally, some projections of a receiving cell were interlocked with the inner cell (Figures 3Cb and 3Cc). To explore the fate of entotic cells we examined whether internalized cells would target to lysosomal compartments. Cells from suspension cultures were stained for three lysosome markers: LAMP1, an integral protein of the lysosome membrane; LysoTracker Red, which marks acidified compartments; and a fluorescent substrate of cathepsin B, a lysosomal protease. After 24 hr, approximately 10% of MCF7 cells were marked by prominent cathepsin B substrate or LysoTracker staining (Figure 4A). Immunostaining for LAMP1 together with β-catenin clearly demonstrated that lysosome-enveloped cells were internalized within another cell (Figure 4A). Similar staining patterns were also found for LAMP2 and LAMP3 (data not shown). The inhibition of ROCK by treatment with Y-27632 reduced the percentages of MCF7 nuclei that were marked with cathepsin B or LysoTracker Red staining or encircled by LAMP1 by ∼10-fold, which correlates their occurrence with entosis (Figure 4A). To address whether internalized cells undergo cell death, suspended MCF7 cells were analyzed for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL, which labels DNA fragments generated during apoptosis or necrosis (Grasl-Kraupp et al., 1995Grasl-Kraupp B. Ruttkay-Nedecky B. Koudelka H. Bukowska K. Bursch W. Schulte-Hermann R. In situ detection of fragmented DNA (TUNEL assay) fails to discriminate among apoptosis, necrosis, and autolytic cell death: a cautionary note.Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1465-1468PubMed Google Scholar) or during lysosomal digestion (McIlroy et al., 2000McIlroy D. Tanaka M. Sakahira H. Fukuyama H. Suzuki M. Yamamura K. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. An auxiliary mode of apoptotic DNA fragmentation provided by phagocytes.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 549-558PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 7% of cells were internalized and TUNEL positive, and this subset was inhibited by Y-27632 or the calcium chelator EGTA, correlating DNA fragmentation with entosis (Figure 4B). Finally, by TEM, 12% of suspended MCF7 cells displayed massive cellular and nuclear degradation that was devoid of apoptotic features, and all of these cells were internalized (Figure 4B). MCF10A cells in suspension were also stained for cathepsin B activity and LAMP1 immunofluorescence. After 24 hr, 1%–2% of cells were marked by prominent cathepsin B substrate staining or encircled by LAMP1 in a ROCK-dependent manner (Figure 4C). This percentage of lysosome-targeted cells persisted but did not increase at 48 and 72 hr (data not shown). A similar percentage of internalized MCF10A cells were TUNEL positive and showed features of degradation by ultrastructure (Figure 4C and data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that entosis in both MCF7 and MCF10A cells leads to lysosomal cell death. To examine the fate of entotic cells in more detail, we followed internalized H2B-GFP-labeled MCF10A and MCF7 cells by time-lapse microscopy of cultures plated on untreated glass coverslips, which exhibit some entosis due to poor adherence. For both MCF10A and MCF7, the most common fate for internalized cells was death (70% for MCF7 and 49% for MCF10A), as evidenced by nuclear degradation and the eventual disappearance of some cells within the enveloping cell (Figure 5A and see Movie S4A). Surprisingly, 18% of internalized MCF10A cells and 12% of MCF7 were released from the outer cell back into the culture (Figure 5A and Movie S4B). These cells had a normal nuclear morphology and some underwent cell division subsequent to their release. The release of internalized cells was not unique to coverslip cultures as this was also observed with suspended cells (data not shown). Even more surprising is that a small percentage of cells (9% for MCF7 and 0.8% for MCF10A) underwent cell division while still internalized (Figure 5A and Movie S4C). These data support the conclusion that entotic cells are viable when they internalize. The remaining 32% of internalized MCF10A and 9% of MCF7 cells did not undergo any observable change over the 20 hr time course (Figure 5A). To examine the role of lysosome function in cell death, internalized cells were followed by time-lapse in the presence of concanamycin A (ConA) (Figure S7), an inhibitor of the vacuolar H+/ATPase. ConA treatment did not dramatically alter the percentage of internalized cells that underwent cell death (37% versus 46% of control cells) but rather changed the nuclear morphology of dying cells from nonapoptotic to apoptotic (Figure 5Ba). Treatment of cells with the ionophore monensin (50 μM) yielded similar results; however, this reagent was also generally more toxic to MCF10A cells (data not shown). The majority (85%) of control cells that underwent cell death displayed nuclear disintegration without fragmentation (Figure 5Ba). Similarly 89% ± 2.5% of TUNEL-positive, internalized cells were negative for cleaved caspase-3 staining (Figure 5Bb), and 86% ± 2.4 of TUNEL-positive, cleaved caspase-3-negative nuclei showed evidence of disintegration without fragmentation (Figure 5Bb). These data suggest that internalized cells predominantly die by a nonapoptotic mechanism that is linked to lysosome function. Analysis of LysoTracker-stained cells by time-lapse also demonstrated that acidification is coincident with nuclear degradation (Figure S8 and Movie S5). In contrast, 100% of ConA-treated cells that died underwent DNA fragmentation (Figures 5Ba and 5Bb and Movie S4D), and fragmented nuclei in these cultures were positive for cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 5Bb). Moreover, these apoptotic cells were not absorbed into the outer cell but rather were retained in a large vacuole, presumably due to lysosome dysfunction (Movie S4D). To follow the fate of cells in which apoptosis was inhibited, we performed time-lapse analysis of MCF10A cells overexpressing Bcl2 in the absence or presence of ConA. Death of internalized MCF10A-Bcl2 cells was inhibited nearly 2-fold (26% compared to 46% for control MCF10A), and of the detectable cell death events, 98% occurred by disintegration in the absence of DNA fragmentation, suggesting that Bcl2 is a strong inhibitor of apoptotic cell death of internalized cells and a partial inhibitor of nonapoptotic cell death (Figures 5Ba and 5Bb). Strikingly, treatment of Bcl2-overexpressing cells with ConA reduced the level of cell death to less than 1%. This nearly complete inhibition of cell death was associated with an increase in the release of internalized cells from 14%–15% (for Bcl2 and MCF10A controls) to 38% (Figure 5Ba). Together, these data demonstrate that lysosomal degradation is the predominant mechanism for elimination of internalized cells; however, an alternate apoptotic program can compensate to execute cell death when lysosomal function is disrupted. The internalized cells detected in suspended MCF10A and MCF7 cultures closely resemble commonly observed cytological features referred to as cell-in-cell or cell cannibalism in clinical cancer specimens. Interestingly, these features are most frequently detected in metastatic tumor cells that grow in a partial state of suspension in fluid exudates, for example in the pleural space surrounding the lungs (Gupta and Dey, 2003Gupta K. Dey P. Cell cannibalism: diagnostic marker of malignancy.Diagn. Cytopathol. 2003; 28: 86-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To investigate the nature of cell-in-cell structures in human metastatic tumors, we immunostained breast tumor cells harvested from the pleural fluid of patients. Cells were stained with antibodies directed against β-catenin and MUC-1 to label the tumor cell population. Seven of eight exudate samples that were analyzed displayed some tumor cell internalization with most showing 1% to 2%, and one (#2) displayed a high level (20%) of cell-in-cell tumor structures (Figure 6A). The majority of internalized cells in this sample were negative for cleaved caspase-3 (96% negative), and nearly 40% were encircled by LAMP1 staining (Figure 6C). Cell-in-cell intermediates displayed increased intensity of β-catenin at cell-cell interfaces, and some also displayed plaques at the most distant points of contact between the inner and outer cells (Figure 6C, arrows). Effusion sample #4 had a sufficient quantity of tumor cells to analyze cell-in-cell by ultrastructure. By TEM, we could find fully internalized cells that appeared to be viable (i.e., no evidence of apoptosis or necrosis), as well as intermediates that resembled the in vitro structures, with close contact between two cells at the end of finger-like projections where we observed adherens junctions (Figures 6D and S9). Thus, the cell-in-cell structures associated with human tumor cells display similar morphological features as the suspended MCF10A and MCF7 cells. Therefore, entosis in suspension cultures in vitro mimics distinguishing features of the cell-in-cell phenomenon in human tumor cells in fluid exudates. Recently the cell-in-cell cytological feature was described in primary breast tumors in addition to metastatic tumor exudates (Abodief et al., 2006Abodief W.T. Dey P. Al-Hattab O. Cell cannibalism in ductal carcinoma of breast.Cytopathology. 2006; 17: 304-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We investigated a panel of 20 primary human breast carcinomas by H&E or immunohistochemical staining and found that 11 of these displayed features consistent with cell-in-cell (data not shown). Sections from four tumors with the highest number of these structures were immunostained for β-catenin and cleaved caspase-3 or fragmented DNA (TUNEL). All four tumors exhibited evidence of live-cell internalization consistent with entosis, at a frequency of ∼0.5%–2.5% of the total tumor cell population (Figure 6E). Many internalized cells had a normal nuclear morphology and a"

Similarly, Trex1(-/-) mice have an autoinflammatory phenotype; however, the mechanism of Trex1-deficient disease is unknown. We report that Trex1, ordinarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), relocalizes to the S phase nucleus after gamma irradiation or hydroxyurea treatment. Notably, Trex1-deficient cells show defective G1/S transition and chronic ATM-dependent checkpoint activation, even in the absence of exogenous stress, correlating with persistent single-stranded DNA molecules produced in S phase, which accumulate in the ER. Our data indicate that Trex1 acts on a single-stranded DNA polynucleotide species generated from processing of aberrant replication intermediates to attenuate DNA damage checkpoint signaling and prevent pathological immune activation."
https://openalex.org/W2129584348,"BMP receptors determine the intensity of BMP signals via Smad1 C-terminal phosphorylations. Here we show that a finely controlled cell biological pathway terminates this activity. The duration of the activated pSmad1(Cter) signal was regulated by sequential Smad1 linker region phosphorylations at conserved MAPK and GSK3 sites required for its polyubiquitinylation and transport to the centrosome. Proteasomal degradation of activated Smad1 and total polyubiquitinated proteins took place in the centrosome. Inhibitors of the Erk, p38, and JNK MAPKs, as well as GSK3 inhibitors, prolonged the duration of a pulse of BMP7. Wnt signaling decreased pSmad1(GSK3) antigen levels and redistributed it from the centrosome to cytoplasmic LRP6 signalosomes. In Xenopus embryos, it was found that Wnts induce epidermis and that this required an active BMP-Smad pathway. Epistatic experiments suggested that the dorsoventral (BMP) and anteroposterior (Wnt/GSK3) patterning gradients are integrated at the level of Smad1 phosphorylations during embryonic pattern formation."
https://openalex.org/W2031194197,"Cytoplasmic dynein is a minus-end-directed microtubule motor whose mechanism of movement remains poorly understood. Here, we use optical tweezers to examine the force-dependent stepping behavior of yeast cytoplasmic dynein. We find that dynein primarily advances in 8 nm increments but takes other sized steps (4-24 nm) as well. An opposing force induces more frequent backward stepping by dynein, and the motor walks backward toward the microtubule plus end at loads above its stall force of 7 pN. Remarkably, in the absence of ATP, dynein steps processively along microtubules under an external load, with less force required for minus-end- than for plus-end-directed movement. This nucleotide-independent walking reveals that force alone can drive repetitive microtubule detachment-attachment cycles of dynein's motor domains. These results suggest a model for how dynein's two motor domains coordinate their activities during normal processive motility and provide new clues for understanding dynein-based motility in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2036462969,"NF-κB is a DNA-binding protein complex that transduces a variety of activating signals from the cytoplasm to specific sets of target genes. To understand the preferential recruitment of NF-κB to specific gene regulatory sites, we used NF-κB p65 in a tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry proteomic screen. We identified ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a KH domain protein, as a non-Rel subunit of p65 homodimer and p65-p50 heterodimer DNA-binding complexes that synergistically enhances DNA binding. RPS3 knockdown impaired NF-κB-mediated transcription of selected p65 target genes but not nuclear shuttling or global protein translation. Rather, lymphocyte-activating stimuli caused nuclear translocation of RPS3, parallel to p65, to form part of NF-κB bound to specific regulatory sites in chromatin. Thus, RPS3 is an essential but previously unknown subunit of NF-κB involved in the regulation of key genes in rapid cellular activation responses. Our observations provide insight into how NF-κB selectively controls gene expression.

Thus, RPS3 is an essential but previously unknown subunit of NF-κB involved in the regulation of key genes in rapid cellular activation responses. Our observations provide insight into how NF-κB selectively controls gene expression. NF-κB was originally detected as a site-specific DNA-binding protein complex (Sen and Baltimore, 1986bSen R. Baltimore D. Multiple nuclear factors interact with the immunoglobulin enhancer sequences.Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar) required for the activity of the immunoglobulin (Ig) light-chain gene intronic enhancer (Lenardo et al., 1987Lenardo M. Pierce J.W. Baltimore D. Protein-binding sites in Ig gene enhancers determine transcriptional activity and inducibility.Science. 1987; 236: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The mammalian NF-κB family includes five proteins: p65 (RelA), c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52, which function as homo- or heterodimers to control gene transcription (Ghosh and Karin, 2002Ghosh S. Karin M. Missing pieces in the NF-κB puzzle.Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3206) Google Scholar). Individual dimers exhibit varying binding affinities for specific recognition sites and differ in their regulatory function (Kang et al., 1992Kang S.M. Tran A.C. Grilli M. Lenardo M.J.

The most abundant form of NF-κB contains a p65-p50 heterodimer that regulates many important immunity, inflammation, and antiapoptosis genes (Lenardo and Baltimore, 1989Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D.

Control of B lymphocyte apoptosis by the transcription factor NF-κB.Immunity. 2006; 25: 871-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although NF-κB activation has been studied extensively, how NF-κB recognizes specific DNA-binding sites and governs selected gene expression in response to distinct inducers in different cell types remains an important unresolved question. NF-κB exerts its fundamental role as a transcription factor by binding to variations of κB sites (Chen et al., 1998Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Crystal structure of p50/p65 heterodimer of transcription factor NF-κB bound to DNA.Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The binding of Rel protein dimers to these sites in target genes is minimally required, but questions remain about whether this is sufficient for NF-κB regulation. Crosslinking and structural studies of NF-κB binding reveal that p50 binds to the relatively invariant 5′ half of κB sites and p65 binds to the more variable 3′ half (Chen et al., 1998Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Crystal structure of p50/p65 heterodimer of transcription factor NF-κB bound to DNA.Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, Urban et al., 1991Urban M.B. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. NF-κ B contacts DNA by a heterodimer of the p50 and p65 subunit.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The complexity of p65 binding was highlighted by a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-microarray assay revealing 209 regions on chromosome 22, of which only 60% contain canonical or related κB sites (Martone et al., 2003Martone R. Euskirchen G. Bertone P. Hartman S. Royce T.E. Luscombe N.M. Rinn J.L. Nelson F.K. Miller P. Gerstein M. et al.Distribution of NF-κB-binding sites across human chromosome 22.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 12247-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). High-affinity NF-κB binding cannot be explained solely by the number or character of heterodimer:DNA contacts (Chen et al., 1998Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Crystal structure of p50/p65 heterodimer of transcription factor NF-κB bound to DNA.Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the original size estimate of natural NF-κB found in nuclear extracts was >200 kDa, but purified p50 and p65 proteins form a 115 kDa complex, the size of a simple heterodimer (Urban et al., 1991Urban M.B. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. NF-κ B contacts DNA by a heterodimer of the p50 and p65 subunit.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reconstituted heterodimers from purified proteins have an > 100-fold lower affinity than native NF-κB, at least for binding to the Ig κB motif (Phelps et al., 2000Phelps C.B. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Malek S. Ghosh G. Mechanism of κ B DNA binding by Rel/NF-κ B dimers.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24392-24399Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These findings hint that natural NF-κB may contain more than just Rel protein dimers. We hypothesized that other proteins are integral parts of NF-κB and used NF-κB p65 as a bait protein in a proteomic screen. We identified the KH domain protein ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) as a p65-binding component of NF-κB complexes that was essential for NF-κB binding to specific regulatory sites and for inducible expression of a variety of genes. This surprising extraribosomal function for RPS3 provides insight into how NF-κB selectively controls gene expression. To search for novel NF-κB proteins, we fused p65 with tandem affinity peptides (TAP), overexpressed this “bait” protein in 293T cells, and copurified p65-binding proteins through two consecutive affinity steps. Mass spectrometry identified ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) as a major coprecipitant (Figures 1A and S1, see Supplemental Data available with this article online). No other ribosomal proteins were detected, ruling out contamination with whole ribosomes. RPS3 consists of 243 amino acids with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) domain and a KH domain (Figure 1A). RPS3 is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, but it also has extraribosomal functions in DNA repair (Hegde et al., 2004Hegde V. Wang M. Deutsch W.A. Characterization of human ribosomal protein S3 binding to 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine and abasic sites by surface plasmon resonance.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In a GST pull-down assay, we demonstrated that RPS3 binds to p65 (Figure 1B). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous RPS3 revealed a strong association with endogenous p65 in Jurkat cells (Figure 1C). We also detected p50 and IκBα in this immunoprecipitate (Figure 1C). Additional experiments showed no direct interaction of RPS3 with p50, RelB, c-Rel, or IκBα (data not shown), suggesting that the association of p50 and IκBα with RPS3 was indirect and occurred through an inhibitory p50:p65:IκBα complex. Conversely, endogenous RPS3 was precipitated with antibodies against endogenous p65 and p50 (Figure 1D). Hence, there is a strong physical interaction between RPS3 and p65. We next measured the effect of RNAi-mediated knockdown of RPS3 on the expression of an NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter construct. Four different siRNA duplexes decreased the total amount of RPS3 protein by ∼50% compared to a nonspecific (NS) control siRNA (Figure 2A). As expected, T cell receptor (TCR) and TNFα stimulation induced NF-κB-driven luciferase activity in NS siRNA-treated cells, but this was strongly and equivalently suppressed by RPS3 knockdown or p65 knockdown (Figures 2A and S2). NF-κB activity was restored by an RPS3 expression construct containing a mutated nucleotide sequence that could not be targeted by the RPS3 siRNA (mut1), confirming that the loss of NF-κB transcription was not due to off-target effects (Figure 2B). Knockdown of RPS16, a different 40S ribosomal protein, had no effect on NF-κB reporter activity (Figure 2C). Taken together, these data specifically implicate RPS3 in NF-κB-induced reporter gene expression during T cell stimulation. Conversely, reduction of RPS3 did not impair phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced AP-1 signaling (Figure 2D). Therefore, silencing RPS3 affected NF-κB signaling, but not all TCR-induced signal transduction. As a component of the ribosomal 40S subunit, RPS3 plays a key role in protein translation. However, protein synthesis in cells transfected with NS versus RPS3 siRNA was equivalent, showing that the abrogation of NF-κB signaling by silencing RPS3 is not due to a general protein translation defect (Figure S3). These data also suggest that the RPS3 siRNA had a disproportionate effect on p65-associated RPS3. Given the known stability of ribosomes, we hypothesized that there was a distinct pool of RPS3 sequestered from ribosome-associated RPS3 that was more labile and therefore more susceptible to RNAi. We subjected cell lysates to ultracentrifugation to separate the soluble, ribosome-free cytosol (S100) from a particulate pellet containing ribosomes (P100). We detected RPS3 in both the S100 and P100 fractions, in proportions of ∼40% and 60% of total cellular RPS3 (Figure 2E). We also found that the cytosolic RPS3 was clearly reduced after RNAi knockdown, whereas the ribosomal RPS3 was largely unaffected (Figure 2E). Hence, it is likely that the cytosolic pool of RPS3 plays the major role in NF-κB signaling, marked by a striking inhibition of NF-κB-driven transcription when it is eliminated by RPS3 siRNA. We next investigated whether RPS3 affected p65 liberation from IκBα or nuclear translocation. We found no such effect; rather, RPS3 itself translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus when assessed by immunofluorescence staining after stimulation with αCD3/CD28 or TNFα, but not geldanamycin (GA), an NF-κB-independent stimulus (Figure 3A). Immunoblots revealed that, after stimulation, the cytoplasmic levels of p65 and RPS3 decreased and nuclear levels increased with similar kinetics, whereas RPS16 remained unchanged (Figure 3B). We also found that nuclear translocation of p65 was identical after TCR stimulation in NS- and RPS3-silenced cells, as judged by western blot and immunofluorescence (Figures 3B and 3C). Furthermore, IκBα degradation occurred normally in response to activating stimuli despite RPS3 knockdown (data not shown). Thus, RPS3 does not govern p65 nuclear accumulation. Conversely, p65 knockdown has no influence on TCR-induced RPS3 nuclear accumulation (Figures 3B and 3D). Each protein contains an NLS that may facilitate independent nuclear translocation. The surprising observation that RPS3 translocates into the nucleus after cellular activating stimuli underscores its novel extraribosomal function in NF-κB signaling since the primary translation function of RPS3 operates in the cytoplasm. A variety of coregulators are known to influence NF-κB signaling, and most of these can physically associate with NF-κB-family proteins (Gao et al., 2005Gao Z. Chiao P. Zhang X. Zhang X. Lazar M.A. Seto E. Young H.A. Ye J. Coactivators and corepressors of NF-κB in IκB α gene promoter.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21091-21098Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether RPS3 serves as a coactivator for p65, but we found that RPS3 overexpression failed to boost NF-κB signaling either before or after TCR stimulation (Figure S4A). Using a standard coactivation assay, we found that RPS3 possesses little, if any, intrinsic transcriptional activating ability and therefore does not resemble a conventional coactivator (Figures S4B and S4C, detailed results in Supplemental Data). We also tested whether p65 overexpression could bypass the requirement for RPS3 in NF-κB signaling. In cells that received NS siRNA, p65 overexpression significantly increased NF-κB signaling (Figure 4A). By contrast, RPS3 knockdown prevented p65 overexpression from increasing NF-κB activity, indicating that excess p65 cannot override the requirement for RPS3 (Figure 4A). A similar result was obtained by overexpressing the inhibitor of κB kinase β (IKKβ), an upstream activator for p65 (Figure 4B). Thus, RPS3 affects a later step in NF-κB signaling, either downstream or in conjunction with p65. Interestingly, coexpression of the two proteins successfully augmented NF-κB signaling, in a RPS3 dose-dependent manner, compared to the signal induced by p65 overexpression alone (Figure 4C). This suggests that RPS3 plays a critical role in p65-mediated NF-κB signaling (Figures 4A and 4B), most likely in stoichiometric relation to the cellular concentration of p65. A mutual transcriptional function involving binding of RPS3 and p65 was also supported by enhanced transcription of pG5-Luc involving coexpression of GAL4-RPS3 and p65 compared with p65 alone (Figure S4D). To understand the association of RPS3 with p65, we carried out a structure-function study with deletions of both proteins (Figures 4D–4G). We found that the N-terminal portion (NTD, aa 21–186) of the Rel homology domain (RHD) of p65 was necessary for binding to RPS3, whereas the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain (TAD) was not involved (Figure 4E). A similar analysis of RPS3 revealed that the N-terminal region (aa 1–111), particularly the KH domain (aa 41–111), was needed for p65 binding (Figure 4G). The p65 NTD and the RPS3 KH domain both have nucleic acid-binding capacities, suggesting that RPS3 might regulate the DNA binding of NF-κB. We first tested whether RPS3 could be recruited to promoters in NF-κB target genes in vivo by using a ChIP assay. We found that precipitation of either p65 or RPS3 gave the same signal for the 200–300 bp region containing κB sites of two well-studied NF-κB target genes, IκBα and IL-8 (Figures 5A and S5). Therefore, RPS3 is a component of the NF-κB transcriptional complex formed at relevant promoter sites. To determine whether RPS3 is incorporated into the NF-κB DNA-binding complex, we employed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with nuclear extracts prepared from 293T cells transfected with or without FLAG-tagged RPS3. TNFα stimulation strongly increased two NF-κB bands (Figure 5B, compare lanes 2 and 11 to lanes 1 and 10). The specificity of these bands was confirmed by cold oligonucleotide competition: wild-type κB oligonucleotides competed away both induced bands as well as nonspecific bands (Figure 5B, lane 7), whereas mutant κB and unrelated OCT1 oligonucleotides only diminished the nonspecific bands (Figure 5B, lanes 8 and 9). The addition of p65 (Figure 5B, lane 5) and p50 (Figure 5B, lane 6) antibodies indicated that the upper and lower bands contained p65 homodimers and p65-p50 heterodimers, respectively, consistent with previous reports (Sathe et al., 2004Sathe S.S. Sizemore N. Li X. Vithalani K. Commane M. Swiatkowski S.M. Stark G.R. Mutant human cells with constitutive activation of NF-κB.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Most importantly, FLAG antibody supershifted both NF-κB bands (Figure 5B, lane 14), similar to p65 antibody (Figure 5B, lane 13), in cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged RPS3. Thus, NF-κB gel-shift complexes, widely believed to contain only Rel proteins such as p65 and p50, also contain the non-Rel protein RPS3. To validate this result, we preincubated the nuclear extracts with an antibody that specifically recognizes native RPS3 and found that it too blocks the formation of both p65-containing complexes, verifying that endogenous RPS3 is an essential component for both NF-κB complexes that form with the Ig κB oligonucleotide (Figure 5C, lanes 19–21). These complexes were unaltered by isotype control antibody (Figure 5B, lanes 3 and 12; Figure 5C, lane 18), whereas the RPS3 antibody did not modify OCT1 or AP-1 EMSA complexes (Figure 5D), indicating that the effect on NF-κB binding was specific. A similar result was also obtained in nuclear extracts from TCR-stimulated Jurkat cells (Figure S6) and LPS-stimulated 70Z/3 cells (data not shown). These results, combined with ChIP data, strongly suggest that RPS3 and p65 are bound to each other and are jointly recruited, in some cases along with p50, as an NF-κB complex to certain cognate DNA-binding sites in target genes. Having established that RPS3 can be part of NF-κB complexes, we next investigated whether endogenous RPS3 is necessary for NF-κB binding to target genes. We performed a ChIP analysis of endogenous p65 recruitment to κB sites in chromatin by using cells either with or without RPS3 knockdown. As expected, p65 was recruited to IκBα and IL-8 promoters after stimulation of cells transfected with NS siRNA (Figure 6A). By contrast, p65 recruitment was severely diminished when RPS3 was depleted (Figure 6A). We also observed that RPS3 recruitment to those promoter sites was severely diminished in cells transfected with p65, but not NS siRNA (Figure 6A). Hence, RPS3 and p65 bind in a mutually dependent fashion to κB sites in gene control sequences. Lack of binding to these promoter sites correlated with the endogenous function of IL-8 and IκBα genes since TCR-induced mRNA expression from both genes was decreased by RPS3 knockdown (Figure 6B). Given the in vivo effects of RPS3 on NF-κB binding and function, we next explored how RPS3 influences NF-κB complexes in vitro by using purified recombinant p65, p50, and RPS3 (as a GST-RPS3 fusion) proteins in EMSAs. Recombinant p65 alone bound weakly to an Ig κB DNA site with only one detectable band (Figure 6C, lane 1), which likely represents a homodimer (Urban et al., 1991Urban M.B. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. NF-κ B contacts DNA by a heterodimer of the p50 and p65 subunit.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, preincubation of RPS3 with recombinant p65 increased the magnitude of p65 gel-shift complex nearly 100-fold in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 6C, lanes 2–5). RPS3 presumably incorporated into the p65 complex because the complex migrated more slowly in proportion to the amount of RPS3 added (Figure 6C, lanes 2′–5′). We then formed complexes with recombinant p50 and p65 proteins and observed two weak bands that ostensibly represent homodimers and heterodimers (Figure 6E, lane 9). Again, the addition of RPS3 dramatically increased binding and slowed migration in the gel as a single complex (Figure 6E). The NF-κB complex was confirmed by cold oligonucleotide competition and supershift analysis (Figure 6E and data not shown). Addition of RPS3 had no effect on DNA binding or the migration of gel-shift complexes formed by the p50 protein alone, which RPS3 does not bind (Figure S7B). Under the same conditions, no band was apparent with GST or GST-RPS3 alone (Figure S7C), suggesting that RPS3 does not bind the Ig κB DNA site itself, but rather enhances p65 NF-κB DNA-binding activity by direct association with p65. Binding site occupancy measurements showed a 70-fold and a greater than 30-fold effect on p65 homodimer and p65-p50 heterodimer complexes, respectively (Figures 6D and 6F). Since the number of binding sites was limiting in these analyses, the increase in site occupancy is likely an underestimate of the true effect on DNA-binding affinity. Thus, RPS3 exerts a dramatic synergistic effect on the binding of p65-containing NF-κB complexes to DNA. The synergy in binding of RPS3 and p65 to DNA was independently verified by an ELISA assay (TransAM assay) (Figure S7, detailed results in Supplemental Data). These data suggest that, in vitro, RPS3 formed a selective complex with p65 that dramatically increases binding to Ig κB site-containing DNA. We next examined whether RPS3 was required for the formation of native NF-κB complexes with nuclear extracts from the cells transfected with NS or RPS3 siRNAs. In nuclear extracts from nonsilenced Jurkat cells, TCR stimulation induced a strong NF-κB gel-shift complex (Figure 5E). By contrast, essentially no endogenous NF-κB complex could be detected in nuclear extracts from similarly treated RPS3 knockdown Jurkat cells (Figure 5E, compare lane 31 to lane 33). Cold oligonucleotide competition and supershift assays confirmed the specificity of this complex (data not shown). We also found that RPS3 knockdown significantly decreased p65 DNA-binding activity in a TransAm assay even though it did not impair p65 nuclear translocation (Figure S7E). Thus, knockdown of endogenous RPS3 abrogated native NF-κB DNA-binding complexes, indicating that RPS3 is necessary and sufficient for the ability of p65 and p50 to form strong NF-κB-binding complexes with the Ig κB site. To assess the NF-κB transcriptome after the activation of T cells with RPS3 knockdown, we compared p65- and RPS3-silenced versus nonspecific siRNA (NS)-treated samples on the Lymphochip microarray (Shaffer et al., 2000Shaffer A.L. Yu X. He Y. Boldrick J. Chan E.P. Staudt L.M. BCL-6 represses genes that function in lymphocyte differentiation, inflammation, and cell cycle control.Immunity. 2000; 13: 199-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). We found that TCR stimulation induced 57 p65-dependent and 88 RPS3-dependent genes, as judged by their impaired expression after p65 and RPS3 knockdown, respectively (Figure 7A). Of these, 21 genes (37% and 24% in the p65 and RPS3 knockdown groups, respectively) were reduced by both knockdowns, and most were found to be NF-κB target genes (Figures 7A and S8A). A selection of these genes was confirmed by real-time PCR (Figure 6B and data not shown). The overlap between the p65- and RPS3-dependent genes was highly significant (χ2 test, p < 0.001), suggesting parallel in vivo function of RPS3 and p65 at the transcriptional level for this subset of NF-κB-dependent genes. Conversely, a panel of TCR-induced genes known to be NF-κB independent were unaffected by either p65 or RPS3 knockdown (Figure S8B). Thus, RPS3 is required for the expression of a subset of NF-κB target genes driven by p65. To assess whether the requirement for RPS3 is due to the assembly of binding complexes on κB sites, we carried out ChIP assays. We tested the promoter sites for IκBα and IL-2, both of which are RPS3-dependent genes, and we found that immunoprecipitation with antibodies against both p65 and RPS3 gave equivalent signals. However, when testing the κB sites for CD25 and CD69, whose expression is RPS3 independent, we obtained a strong signal with p65 immunoprecipitation, but essentially no signal for RPS3 immunoprecipitation (Figure 7B). This indicates that the endogenous κB sites in the promoters of the IκBα and IL-2 genes are occupied by both proteins, but those in the CD25 and CD69 genes are occupied by p65, but not RPS3. We then tested the association of endogenous p65 with promoter κB sites in cells with intact or knocked down RPS3. We found that the p65 occupancy of κB sites in the promoters of IκBα, IL-8, and IL-2 was markedly reduced in RPS3-knockdown cells (Figure 6A, left panel, and Figure 7C). By contrast, p65 occupancy of κB sites in the RPS3-independent genes, CD25 and CD69, was unaffected in RPS3-knockdown cells (Figure 7C). Moreover, EMSA analysis showed that RPS3 knockdown failed to inhibit the TCR-induced NF-κB complex that formed with the κB DNA site from CD25, which contrasts with the dramatic abolition of the NF-κB complex formed with an Ig κB DNA site (Figures 5E and S9). Therefore, the selective gene expression revealed by the microarray analysis can be explained by differing requirements of specific promoter sites for the RPS3 subunit in NF-κB (Figure 7A). Furthermore, these differences were manifested in the physiological function of these genes in T cells: IL-2 synthesis was impaired by RPS3 knockdown (Figure 7D), whereas upregulation of cell-surface CD25 (necessary for the high-affinity IL-2 receptor) occurred normally (Figure 7E). However, the net result was that TCR-induced proliferation of human T lymphocytes (that depends on IL-2) was blocked by RPS3 knockdown (Figure S10). Thus, the synergistic effect of RPS3 in forming NF-κB complexes on the endogenous chromatin sites paralleled the selective expression of RPS3-dependent genes. To further examine the dependence of NF-κB on RPS3 in a key physiological context, we revisited one of the original cell systems in which the NF-κB transcription factor was first identified by measuring LPS-induced Ig κ light-chain expression in murine pre-B 70Z/3 cells, in which the p65-p50 heterodimer plays a central role (Miyamoto et al., 1994Miyamoto S.

Inducibility of κ immunoglobulin enhancer-binding protein Nf-κ B by a posttranslational mechanism.Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). We stably silenced RPS3 by inserting an RPS3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) into a GFP-expressing lentiviral vector that was transduced into 70Z/3 cells (Furumoto et al., 2006Furumoto Y. Brooks S. Olivera A. Takagi Y. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Casellas R. Beaven M.A. Gilfillan A.M. Rivera J. Cutting edge: lentiviral short hairpin RNA silencing of PTEN in human mast cells reveals constitutive signals that promote cytokine secretion and cell survival.J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 5167-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The transduction efficiency ranged from 90% to 94% in both RPS3-downregulated and control (empty vector) 70Z/3 cells (Figure S11). We found that silencing RPS3 with shRNA slightly diminished basal expression, but substantially inhibited LPS-induced κ light-chain expression on the cell surface (Figures 7F and S12). By contrast, κ light-chain expression induced by IFNγ, which modestly upregulates the κ light chain in 70Z/3 cells via an NF-κB-independent mechanism (Briskin et al., 1988Briskin M.

Induction of κ transcription by interferon-γ without activation of NF-κ B.Science. 1988; 242: 1036-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), was essentially the same whether RPS3 was silenced or not (Figures 7F and S12). To confirm that the inhibition of Ig κ expression was due to effects on NF-κB, we examined nuclear extracts from the 70Z/3 cells by EMSA. We found that LPS induced a strong NF-κB complex in the vector control cells, which was almost completely eliminated in the RPS3-knockdown cells (Figure 7G, upper). Cold competition and supershift analyses revealed it to be a p65-p50-containing NF-κB complex (data not shown). Despite the failure of this NF-κB complex to form with the Ig κ-binding motif, p65 had translocated normally into the nucleus (Figure 7G, bottom). Furthermore, real-time PCR measurements showed that decreasing RPS3 impaired the induction of κ light-chain mRNA (Figure 7H). Finally, we used a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX) (Figure S13), which blocks new synthesis of IκB and allows this labile inhibitor to turn over and release NF-κB to the nucleus, to test the effect of RPS3 knockdown on the induction of NF-κB and Ig κ light-chain mRNA expression in 70Z/3 cells (Sen and Baltimore, 1986aSen R.

We found that κ light-chain mRNA induction by CHX was eliminated by RPS3 knockdown in 70Z/3 cells (Figure 7H), definitively excluding the possibility that this effect was associated with defective translation.

https://openalex.org/W2059996756,"Genome-wide DNA rearrangements occur in many eukaryotes but are most exaggerated in ciliates, making them ideal model systems for epigenetic phenomena. During development of the somatic macronucleus, Oxytricha trifallax destroys 95% of its germ line, severely fragmenting its chromosomes, and then unscrambles hundreds of thousands of remaining fragments by permutation or inversion. Here we demonstrate that DNA or RNA templates can orchestrate these genome rearrangements in Oxytricha, supporting an epigenetic model for sequence-dependent comparison between germline and somatic genomes. A complete RNA cache of the maternal somatic genome may be available at a specific stage during development to provide a template for correct and precise DNA rearrangement. We show the existence of maternal RNA templates that could guide DNA assembly, and that disruption of specific RNA molecules disables rearrangement of the corresponding gene. Injection of artificial templates reprogrammes the DNA rearrangement pathway, suggesting that RNA molecules guide genome rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W2033722815,"An essential feature of the innate immune system is maintaining cellular homeostasis by identifying and removing senescent and apoptotic cells and modified lipoproteins. Identification is achieved through the recognition of molecular patterns, including structurally distinct oxidized phospholipids, on target cells by macrophage receptors. Both the structural nature of the molecular patterns recognized and their orientation within membranes has remained elusive. We recently described the membrane conformation of an endogenous oxidized phospholipid ligand for macrophage scavenger receptor CD36, where the truncated oxidized sn-2 fatty acid moiety protrudes into the aqueous phase, rendering it accessible for recognition. Herein we examine the generality of this conformational motif for peroxidized glycerophospholipids within membranes. Our data reveal that the addition of a polar oxygen atom on numerous peroxidized fatty acids reorients the acyl chain, whereby it no longer remains buried within the membrane interior but rather protrudes into the aqueous compartment. Moreover, we show that neither a conformational change in the head group relative to the membrane surface nor the presence of a polar head group is essential for CD36 recognition of free oxidized phospholipid ligands within membranes. Rather, our results suggest the following global phenomenon. As cellular membranes undergo lipid peroxidation, such as during senescence or apoptosis, previously hydrophobic portions of fatty acids will move from the interior of the lipid bilayer to the aqueous exterior. This enables physical contact between pattern recognition receptor and molecular pattern ligand. Cell membranes thus ""grow whiskers"" as phospholipids undergo peroxidation, and many of their oxidized fatty acids protrude at the surface."
https://openalex.org/W1983724086,"Infection with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum leads to widely different clinical conditions in children, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to coma and death. Despite the immense medical implications, the genetic and molecular basis of this diversity remains largely unknown. Studies of in vitro gene expression have found few transcriptional differences between different parasite strains. Here we present a large study of in vivo expression profiles of parasites derived directly from blood samples from infected patients. The in vivo expression profiles define three distinct transcriptional states. The biological basis of these states can be interpreted by comparison with an extensive compendium of expression data in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The three states in vivo closely resemble, first, active growth based on glycolytic metabolism, second, a starvation response accompanied by metabolism of alternative carbon sources, and third, an environmental stress response. The glycolytic state is highly similar to the known profile of the ring stage in vitro, but the other states have not been observed in vitro. The results reveal a previously unknown physiological diversity in the in vivo biology of the malaria parasite, in particular evidence for a functional mitochondrion in the asexual-stage parasite, and indicate in vivo and in vitro studies to determine how this variation may affect disease manifestations and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2049514067,"G protein-coupled receptor signaling is dynamically regulated by multiple feedback mechanisms, which rapidly attenuate signals elicited by ligand stimulation, causing desensitization. The individual contributions of these mechanisms, however, are poorly understood. Here, we use an improved fluorescent biosensor for cAMP to measure second messenger dynamics stimulated by endogenous β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) in living cells. β2AR stimulation with isoproterenol results in a transient pulse of cAMP, reaching a maximal concentration of ∼10 μm and persisting for less than 5 min. We investigated the contributions of cAMP-dependent kinase, G protein-coupled receptor kinases, and β-arrestin to the regulation of β2AR signal kinetics by using small molecule inhibitors, small interfering RNAs, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We found that the cAMP response is restricted in duration by two distinct mechanisms in HEK-293 cells: G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK6)-mediated receptor phosphorylation leading to β-arrestin mediated receptor inactivation and cAMP-dependent kinase-mediated induction of cAMP metabolism by phosphodiesterases. A mathematical model of β2AR signal kinetics, fit to these data, revealed that direct receptor inactivation by cAMP-dependent kinase is insignificant but that GRK6/β-arrestin-mediated inactivation is rapid and profound, occurring with a half-time of 70 s. This quantitative system analysis represents an important advance toward quantifying mechanisms contributing to the physiological regulation of receptor signaling.

This quantitative system analysis represents an important advance toward quantifying mechanisms contributing to the physiological regulation of receptor signaling. Tachyphylaxis, or desensitization, denoting the attenuation of a biological response to sustained or repeated intervention, is a pervasive phenomenon in physiological systems. For G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 7The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorβ2ARβ2-adrenergic receptorCFPcyan fluorescent proteinEpacexchange protein directly activated by cAMPFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferGRKG protein-coupled receptor kinaseIBMXisobutylmethylxanthineMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastPDEphosphodiesterasePKAprotein kinase ARGSregulator of G protein signalingsiRNAsmall interfering RNAYFPyellow fluorescent protein. (or, more broadly, seven-transmembrane receptors), desensitization occurs through molecular mechanisms that can profoundly limit further stimulation of downstream signals, either through direct receptor inactivation or inhibition of downstream signaling. At the physiological level, we refer to this general loss of responsiveness as desensitization; we refer to the more specific case of direct inhibition of receptor molecules as “receptor inactivation.” At the level of the receptor, GPCR signals represent a dynamic balance between ligand-stimulated activities, such as G protein coupling, and negative feedback mechanisms, such as receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment (1Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). An agonist's efficacy is determined by the balance between these activities and is limited by the kinetics of receptor inactivation. Despite intensive research into the molecular mechanisms of desensitization by GPCR inactivation, the relative contributions of these mechanisms are largely unknown. One reason for this is that, until recently, there have been few techniques that directly measure receptor signaling in real time. Rather, data showing desensitization and receptor inactivation are usually based on either physiological assessments, such as hemodynamic parameters, which are too complex to derive mechanistic descriptions of receptor signal kinetics, or on molecular techniques with low temporal resolution. In particular, most mechanistic studies of the molecular regulation of receptor inactivation are performed with restimulation protocols, which compare signaling in naive cells to signaling in cells pretreated with a stimulatory pulse. In addition, in recent years, most such studies use overexpressed receptor (or broken cell preparations), which may alter physiological regulation by saturating signaling and feedback mechanisms.

The challenge of understanding signaling kinetics in living cells has begun to yield to newly developed techniques utilizing the growing families of fluorescent and luminescent biosensors, which can elucidate the spatial and temporal details of signal transduction (2Zhang J. Campbell R.E. Ting A.Y. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). These sensors have been used to quantify ion concentration, protein translocation, protein turnover, protein-protein interactions, kinase activity, and protein conformational changes over time in living cells (2Zhang J. Campbell R.E. Ting A.Y. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Such data have substantially refined our understanding of molecular and cellular signaling and provide the opportunity to quantify the kinetic mechanisms underpinning receptor function. The activation and desensitization of the archetypal β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) has been extensively studied, yet uncertainty remains regarding the relative contributions of the best characterized mechanisms of β2AR inactivation: 1) cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation and 2) G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation followed by binding of the scaffold protein β-arrestin (1Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that quantitative molecular imaging with a live cell cAMP biosensor would allow us to test the effect of these mechanisms on β2AR signaling kinetics. Furthermore, quantification of real time second messenger concentrations would allow us to develop, test, and refine a mathematical model of GPCR signaling and inactivation. Such a model would allow quantitative approximations and predictions of kinetic mechanisms of receptor regulation. Thus, we set out to 1) develop an improved version of the cAMP reporter ICUE (indicator of cAMP using Epac) (3DiPilato L.M. Cheng X. Zhang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16513-16518Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) with improved sensitivity and decreased ability to disrupt normal cell functions; 2) test the contribution of feedback mechanisms, including receptor inactivation on the kinetics of cAMP signals; and 3) develop a mathematical model for GPCR regulation with both descriptive and predictive capability. ICUE2 Construction and in Vitro Characterization—ICUE2 was created by PCR using Epac1 as the template and amplifying from residue 149 to 881 incorporating KpnI and SacI restriction sites. The amplified Epac1 fragment was then fused to enhanced cyan fluorescent protein and citrine and cloned into pcDNA3 mammalian vector (Invitrogen) as previously described (3DiPilato L.M. Cheng X. Zhang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16513-16518Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In vitro dose-response experiments were performed using cell lysate from HEK-293 cells stably expressing ICUE2. Cells were lysed with nondenaturing mammalian lysis buffer, and fluorescence spectra were measured with a Fluoro-Max-3 fluorimeter (Jobin Yvon, Inc.) upon excitation at 434 nm before and after the addition of cAMP (Sigma). The EC50 values were calculated using a sigmoidal dose-response equation (with variable slope), Ratio=Ratiomin+Ratiomax-Ratiomin1+10log(EC50-X)×Hillslope(Eq. 1) where X represents the logarithmic concentration, Ratio is the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) ratio response, and Ratiomin and Ratiomax are the minimum and maximum FRET ratios, respectively. FRET efficiency was determined by dissociation of citrine, the FRET acceptor, upon the addition of trypsin, as previously described (4Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). ICUE2 in Cells—To measure intracellular cAMP concentrations, we determined the relationship of cAMP concentration to ICUE2 FRET loss by expressing ICUE2 in HEK-293 cells, collecting cellular lysate, blocking cAMP metabolism by the addition of 200 μm IBMX, and measuring the FRET ratio (cyan emission/yellow emission) in the presence of increasing concentrations of cAMP. This analysis revealed a simple sigmoidal dose-response relationship, analogous to ligand-receptor interaction, with an EC50 = 12.5 ± 2.8 μm. This relationship allows us to calculate intracellular free cAMP from measured FRET ratios using the following equation, [cAMP](μM)=12μM·RatioRatiomax-Ratio(Eq. 2) where Ratio represents the instantaneous FRET ratio, and Ratiomax is the maximum change in FRET ratio determined by saturating ICUE2 with cAMP elicited from 50 μm forskolin in the presence of 200 μm IBMX. For analysis of whole cell cAMP responses, we averaged responses from a field of cells (10-30 cells) and averaged these responses across experimental replicates. Thus, all analysis herein ignores subcellular gradients of cAMP and instead reports the average concentration of cAMP experienced by diffusible proteins, such as ICUE2. Cell Culture—HEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained similarly to HEK-293 except in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. To establish ICUE2-stable HEK-293 cells, G418 at 500 μg/ml was used for selection and maintained at 250 μg/ml. siRNA and Plasmid Transfection—HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) or calcium phosphate and allowed to incubate for 12-24 h before imaging. MEF cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent for 4-6 h and allowed to grow for 12-24 h in fresh medium before imaging. siRNA was transfected with GeneSilencer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Gene Therapy Systems). Imaging—Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer 24-72 h after transfection and imaged in the dark on a 37 °C temperature-controlled stage. Cells were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with MicroMAX BFT512 cooled charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific) controlled by METAFLUOR 6.2 (Universal Imaging) or SlideBook 4.0 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Dual emission ratio imaging used a 420DF20 excitation filter, a 450DRLP dichroic mirror, and 475DF40 and 535DF25 emission filters for CFP and YFP, respectively. The filters were alternated by a Lambda 10-2 filter changer (Sutter Instruments). Exposure time was 100-500 ms, and images were taken every 2-20 s. Background corrections of fluorescent images were carried out by subtracting the intensity of the background (autofluorescent cells and/or no cells) from the emission intensities of fluorescent cells expressing the reporters. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer and adjusted to equal protein concentration by protein assay of a parallel set of cells. Equal amounts of protein were separated on 10% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride membranes for immunoblotting. GRKs were detected with isoform-specific antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) for GRK2 (sc-562), GRK3 (sc-563), GRK5 (sc-565), and GRK6 (sc-566), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, total extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and β-arrestin 2 were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (1:3,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), an anti-MAPK1/2 (1:10,000 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and a rabbit polyclonal anti-β-arrestin 2 antibody (A2CT) (1:5,000 dilution), respectively. Chemiluminescent detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce). Chemiluminescence was quantified by a charge-coupled device camera (Syngene ChemiGenius2); representative images are shown as inverted grayscale. Supplemental Material—Fig. S1 shows the lack of effect of ICUE2 expression on β2AR-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signals. Fig. S2 shows that PKA inhibition has no effect on β-arrestin recruitment to the β2AR. Fig. S3 shows that inhibition of Gαi signaling with pertussis toxin has no effect on cAMP dynamics. Fig. S4 shows the analysis of the mathematical model's parameter fitting. Fig. S5 shows the effect of simulating GRK overexpression on the mathematical model's simulation. Development and Use of ICUE2 to Measure cAMP Dynamics—Recently, several laboratories have developed FRET-based indicators for cAMP. These biosensors are based on the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac (5de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar), which is regulated by binding cAMP, resulting in conformational changes. Fusing Epac to the cyan and yellow variants of green fluorescent protein (CFP and YFP, respectively) allows detection of cAMP by measuring changes in intramolecular FRET attendant to cAMP-induced conformational changes (3DiPilato L.M. Cheng X. Zhang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16513-16518Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 6Nikolaev V.O. Bunemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol.

Jalink K. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). To probe receptor regulation most effectively, we engineered an improved version of ICUE1, our previously developed cAMP biosensor (3DiPilato L.M. Cheng X. Zhang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16513-16518Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), to maximize signal detection and minimize perturbation of cellular functions. To accomplish this, we deleted the first amino-terminal 148 amino acids of Epac1, consisting of the DEP domain and an N′-terminal region responsible for membrane and mitochondrial targeting, respectively (8Qiao J. Mei F.C. Popov V.L. Vergara L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26581-26586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We named this biosensor ICUE2. Spectrophotometric measurement of the emission spectrum of ICUE2 in cell lysate demonstrated cAMP-dependent FRET changes; the addition of 1 mm cAMP decreases yellow emission (525 nm emission peak) and increases cyan emission (485 nm emission peak), consistent with reduced FRET for cAMP-bound ICUE2 (Fig. 1B). We found a maximum change in FRET ratio (yellow emission intensity/cyan emission intensity) of 61%. The FRET signal was shown to be intramolecular by limited proteolysis, which cleaves CFP from YFP, and completely abrogates the yellow emission peak. By this technique, FRET efficiency values were calculated to be 30 and 11% before and after cAMP addition, respectively. We calibrated these FRET changes to cAMP concentrations (Fig. 1C), allowing us to measure cAMP responses quantitatively. We then tested ICUE2 in living cells by transient transfection of HEK-293 cells, which express endogenous β2AR at ∼100 fmol/mg, or 90,000 receptors/cell (data not shown). We tested the ability of ICUE2 to respond to 1 μm isoproterenol and found a rapid and transient increase in FRET ratio (Fig. 2A). We then added 50 μm forskolin to maximally stimulate cAMP production, which increased the FRET ratio above that reached with isoproterenol stimulation. This demonstrates that isoproterenol-induced cAMP is within the dynamic range of ICUE2. cAMP specificity was demonstrated with a variant of ICUE2 carrying the mutation R373E in the ICUE2 sequence, which destroys the cAMP binding pocket; this mutant did not respond to either isoproterenol or forskolin stimuli. When expressed in cells, ICUE2 showed an even distribution of fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm, without the subcellular localization patterns observed with ICUE1 (3DiPilato L.M. Cheng X. Zhang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16513-16518Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the absence of membrane and mitochondrial targeting moieties caused by Epac1 truncation, as also seen with a different cAMP indicator (7Ponsioen B. Zhao J. Riedl J. Zwartkruis F. van der Krogt G. Zaccolo M. Moolenaar W.H. Bos J.L. Jalink K. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). We visualized intracellular cAMP by pseudocolor representation of FRET ratio changes (Fig. 2B); this analysis revealed that ICUE2-detected changes in cAMP were uniform across the cell, as expected for an untargeted, diffusible reporter measuring a similarly diffusible analyte. Isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP reaches concentrations on the order of 10 μm (Fig. 2C). This response is sensitive to both the β2AR antagonist ICI-118,551 and the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor MDL-12,330A. The transient cAMP response to isoproterenol is not unique to HEK-293 cells; we found a similar transient cAMP response to isoproterenol in rat vascular smooth muscle cells, indicating that cAMP dynamics are also rapid in more physiological cells (data not shown). In addition, ICUE2 does not alter downstream signaling, since ICUE2 expression does not significantly affect isoproterenol-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation, as might be expected from an Epac-based reporter (Fig. S1). Thus, we conclude that ICUE2 is a sensitive, relatively inert biosensor for intracellular cAMP. Kinetics of β2-Adrenergic Receptor-stimulated cAMP—Isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP responses display dose-dependent amplitude but surprisingly display largely dose-independent kinetics with similar times for peak cAMP concentration and duration for all concentrations of isoproterenol (Fig. 3A). Significant cAMP response was detectable at isoproterenol concentrations as low as 3 nm. These responses, converted to a single measurement by integrating cAMP concentration over time, display an EC50 of ∼20 nm (Fig. 3B), consistent with traditional measurements of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in HEK-293 cells. However, in contrast to traditional cAMP measurements, which usually rely on inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) to allow accumulation of significant cAMP concentration, ICUE2 measures cAMP in the native environment and thus reflects biological kinetics of cAMP responses. Indeed, the effect of PDE inhibition on cAMP responses is profound, demonstrating that PDE activity plays a critical role in limiting the magnitude and duration of cAMP signals (Fig. 3C). The residual cAMP clearance is probably caused by incomplete PDE inhibition and cAMP efflux from the cells. We then set out to investigate the mechanisms that determine the duration of β2AR stimulation of cAMP. Two classes of negative feedback regulation have been described for the β2AR: “heterologous” mechanisms regulated by PKA and “homologous” mechanisms regulated by GRKs and β-arrestins (1Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of PKA with 20 μm H-89 resulted in profound enhancement of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP (Fig. 4A). However, at least some of this effect is caused by regulation downstream of the receptor; H-89 also had a significant effect on forskolin-stimulated cAMP (Fig. 4B). This postreceptor regulation was caused by H-89-sensitive regulation of PDEs, since PDE inhibition eliminated the effect of H-89 on forskolin-stimulated cAMP (Fig. 4C). We also measured the effect of PKA on PDE activity for β2AR signaling by blocking the receptor with 10 μm propranolol 30 s after isoproterenol stimulation, when cAMP concentrations are maximal; this allows measurement of the rate of cAMP clearance. H-89 resulted in a marked slowing of cAMP clearance, consistent with a PKA-stimulated enhancement of PDE activity (Fig. 4D). Fidelity of this assay to cAMP clearance was verified by showing that the identical propranolol treatment of isoproterenol-stimulated cells results in rapid dissociation of β-arrestin from receptor (t½ ∼ 3 s) (Fig. S2A); H-89 had no effect on this rate. The receptor is inactivated by propranolol treatment at least as rapidly as β-arrestin dissociation, indicating that the rate-limiting step in cAMP reduction after propranolol treatment is cAMP clearance. Since PKA has been shown to phosphorylate and activate PDE4 (9Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), the dominant PDE in our cells (data not shown), we conclude that PKA inhibits β2AR-stimulated cAMP, at least in part, by PDE activation. We then tested and ruled out other mechanisms of PKA regulation of β2AR-mediated cAMP, including 1) phosphorylation and activation of GRK2 (10Cong M. Perry S.J. Lin F.T. Fraser I.D. Hu L.A. Chen W. Pitcher J.A. Scott J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15192-15199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), 2) phosphorylation and switching of β2AR from coupling to Gαs to Gαi (11Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), and 3) inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (12Houslay M.D. Milligan G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). We found that PKA does not significantly regulate GRK/β-arrestin function in our cells, since H-89 affected neither the amount nor the rate of isoproterenol-stimulated β-arrestin recruitment, a measure of GRK activity (13Violin J.D. Ren X.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20577-20588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2B). This result also demonstrates that despite the weak affinity of H-89 for the β2AR (14Penn R.B. Parent J.L. Pronin A.N. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Benovic J.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 288: 428-437PubMed Google Scholar), at the concentrations of H-89 and isoproterenol used here, H-89 does not directly interfere with β2AR activation. In addition, under our experimental conditions, PKA did not promote coupling of the β2AR to Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (supplemental Fig. S3). We also found no evidence of PKA activation of adenylyl cyclase, since H-89 had no effect on forskolin-stimulated cAMP when PDEs were inhibited (Fig. 4C). Thus, the major postreceptor feedback mechanism in our cells is PKA activation of cAMP clearance by PDEs. However, the effects of this feedback and of direct receptor inactivation by heterologous (PKA-mediated) and homologous (β-arrestin/GRK-mediated) mechanisms are still unclear. We thus set out to quantify the contribution of each mechanism. Homologous and Heterologous Mechanisms of β2-Adrenergic Receptor Inactivation—To investigate β-arrestin function in β2AR inactivation, we ablated β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 expression with siRNA-mediated silencing (15Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1740-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In comparison with a nonsilencing control siRNA, an siRNA that targets both β-arrestins simultaneously increased and prolonged isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP concentrations (Fig. 5A). To rule out differences in β2AR cell surface expression as a reason for altered cAMP responses, we measured cell surface receptor density by radioligand binding and found no significant changes after β-arrestin silencing (data not shown). The effect of β-arrestin siRNA on cAMP dynamics was dramatically amplified when cells were pretreated with H-89 to inhibit PKA-mediated desensitization mechanisms (Fig. 5B). However, some desensitization remained, despite blockade of all known mechanisms of negative feedback. This was explained by incomplete silencing of β-arrestin, which was at best 80% and averaged 75% (Fig. 5C), consistent with earlier findings (15Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E.

Chem. 2006; 281: 36411-36419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, the remaining desensitization was probably mediated by the unsilenced fraction of β-arrestins. To verify this, we tested isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP dynamics in MEFs from wild-type and β-arrestin 1/2 knock-out mice (17Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). We found that in MEFs transiently transfected with ICUE2 and stimulated with 1 μm isoproterenol, the absence of β-arrestins led to a pronounced loss of desensitization. This effect was amplified by H-89 inhibition of PKA, resulting in complete abrogation of desensitization (Fig. 5, D and E). This suggests that perfect β-arrestin silencing in HEK-293 cells would similarly result in complete disruption of β2AR receptor inactivation when combined with PKA inhibition. We also used siRNA to determine the role of GRKs in regulating cAMP dynamics. Since PKA stimulation of PDE may obscure the contributions of GRKs to β2AR inactivation, we inhibited PKA activity with H-89 to isolate GRK- andβ-arrestin-dependent desensitization. siRNA silencing of GRK2, GRK3, GRK5, or GRK6 revealed that only GRK6 has an effect on cAMP regulation in our HEK-293 cells; in the absence of GRK6, cAMP is amplified and prolonged (Fig. 6A). GRK silencing was confirmed by immunoblot (Fig. 6B), and radioligand binding studies showed no significant effect of GRK silencing on receptor expression (data not shown). We confirmed this result with a different siRNA sequence targeting GRK6, which similarly prolonged isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP, but also reduced β2AR expression (data not shown). Thus, GRK6 is the most potent regulator of β2AR inactivation among the GRKs expressed in HEK-293 cells. Overexpression of GRK6 had the opposite effect, dramatically speeding receptor inactivation (Fig. 6C); this indicates that GRK activity is the rate-limiting step in β2AR inactivation and determines cAMP signal duration. Interestingly, overexpression of any other GRK also sped β2AR inactivation, suggesting that GRK overexpression overcomes any GRK specificity arising from substrate sequence preference (data not shown). These results are consistent with results showing GRK6 phosphorylation of the β2AR to be the limiting step in receptor recruitment of β-arrestin and β-arrestin-mediated receptor inactivation in HEK-293 cells (13Violin J.D. Ren X.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20577-20588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the relative physiological contributions of the GRK and PKA desensitization mechanisms are still unclear, particularly since PKA can inhibit cAMP accumulation through both direct β2AR inactivation and through stimulation of cAMP clearance by PDEs. Discrimination of these mechanisms is possible with the use of mutant receptors and PDEs, which are not regulated by PKA and/or GRK (9Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 18Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1974710999,"Events can sometimes appear longer or shorter in duration than other events of equal length. For example, in a repeated presentation of auditory or visual stimuli, an unexpected object of equivalent duration appears to last longer. Illusions of duration distortion beg an important question of time representation: when durations dilate or contract, does time in general slow down or speed up during that moment? In other words, what entailments do duration distortions have with respect to other timing judgments? We here show that when a sound or visual flicker is presented in conjunction with an unexpected visual stimulus, neither the pitch of the sound nor the frequency of the flicker is affected by the apparent duration dilation. This demonstrates that subjective time in general is not slowed; instead, duration judgments can be manipulated with no concurrent impact on other temporal judgments. Like spatial vision, time perception appears to be underpinned by a collaboration of separate neural mechanisms that usually work in concert but are separable. We further show that the duration dilation of an unexpected stimulus is not enhanced by increasing its saliency, suggesting that the effect is more closely related to prediction violation than enhanced attention. Finally, duration distortions induced by violations of progressive number sequences implicate the involvement of high-level predictability, suggesting the involvement of areas higher than primary visual cortex. We suggest that duration distortions can be understood in terms of repetition suppression, in which neural responses to repeated stimuli are diminished."
https://openalex.org/W2133652633,"Background Relatively long duration retinal light exposure elicits nonvisual responses in humans, including modulation of alertness and cognition. These responses are thought to be mediated in part by melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells which are more sensitive to blue light than violet or green light. The contribution of the melanopsin system and the brain mechanisms involved in the establishment of such responses to light remain to be established. Methodology/Principal Findings We exposed 15 participants to short duration (50 s) monochromatic violet (430 nm), blue (473 nm), and green (527 nm) light exposures of equal photon flux (1013ph/cm2/s) while they were performing a working memory task in fMRI. At light onset, blue light, as compared to green light, increased activity in the left hippocampus, left thalamus, and right amygdala. During the task, blue light, as compared to violet light, increased activity in the left middle frontal gyrus, left thalamus and a bilateral area of the brainstem consistent with activation of the locus coeruleus. Conclusion/Significance These results support a prominent contribution of melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells to brain responses to light within the very first seconds of an exposure. The results also demonstrate the implication of the brainstem in mediating these responses in humans and speak for a broad involvement of light in the regulation of brain function."
https://openalex.org/W2093935222,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel localized at apical cell membranes and exists in macromolecular complexes with a variety of signaling and transporter molecules. Here, we report that the multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4), a cAMP transporter, functionally and physically associates with CFTR. Adenosine-stimulated CFTR-mediated chloride currents are potentiated by MRP4 inhibition, and this potentiation is directly coupled to attenuated cAMP efflux through the apical cAMP transporter. CFTR single-channel recordings and FRET-based intracellular cAMP dynamics suggest that a compartmentalized coupling of cAMP transporter and CFTR occurs via the PDZ scaffolding protein, PDZK1, forming a macromolecular complex at apical surfaces of gut epithelia. Disrupting this complex abrogates the functional coupling of cAMP transporter activity to CFTR function. Mrp4 knockout mice are more prone to CFTR-mediated secretory diarrhea. Our findings have important implications for disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and secretory diarrhea."

Eight research papers in this issue present new results from the mission, covering the atmosphere, polar features, interactions with the solar wind and the controversial matter of venusian lightning. Håkan Svedham et al. open the section with a review of the similarities and (mostly) differences between Venus and its 'twin', the Earth. Andrew Ingersoll considers the latest results, and also how the project teams plan to make the most of the probe's remaining six years of life. Venus' mesosphere is a transition region between the retrograde super rotation at the top of the thick clouds and the solar-antisolar circulation in the thermosphere. The mesospheric distributions of HF, HCl, H2O and HDO are reported, and an unexpected extensive layer of warm air at altitudes 90–120 km on the nightside is found. Venus has thick clouds of H2SO4 aerosol particles extending from altitudes of 40 to 60 km. The 60–100 km region (the mesosphere) is a transition region between the 4 day retrograde superrotation at the top of the thick clouds and the solar–antisolar circulation in the thermosphere (above 100 km), which has upwelling over the subsolar point and transport to the nightside1,2. The mesosphere has a light haze of variable optical thickness, with CO, SO2, HCl, HF, H2O and HDO as the most important minor gaseous constituents, but the vertical distribution of the haze and molecules is poorly known because previous descent probes began their measurements at or below 60 km. Here we report the detection of an extensive layer of warm air at altitudes 90–120 km on the night side that we interpret as the result of adiabatic heating during air subsidence. Such a strong temperature inversion was not expected, because the night side of Venus was otherwise so cold that it was named the ‘cryosphere’ above 100 km. We also measured the mesospheric distributions of HF, HCl, H2O and HDO. HCl is less abundant than reported 40 years ago3. HDO/H2O is enhanced by a factor of ∼2.5 with respect to the lower atmosphere, and there is a general depletion of H2O around 80–90 km for which we have no explanation."

https://openalex.org/W2013128795,"We report a comprehensive analysis of sequence features that allow for the production of autonomous human heavy chain variable (VH) domains that are stable and soluble in the absence of a light chain partner. Using combinatorial phage-displayed libraries and conventional biophysical methods, we analyzed the entire former light chain interface and the third complementarity determining region (CDR3). Unlike the monomeric variable domains of camelid heavy chain antibodies (VHH domains), in which autonomous behavior depends on interactions between the hydrophobic former light chain interface and CDR3, we find that the stability of many in vitro evolved VH domains is essentially independent of the CDR3 sequence and instead derives from mutations that increase the hydrophilicity of the former light chain interface by replacing exposed hydrophobic residues with structurally compatible hydrophilic substitutions. The engineered domains can be expressed recombinantly at high yield, are predominantly monomeric at high concentrations, unfold reversibly, and are even more thermostable than typical camelid VHH domains. Many of the stabilizing mutations are rare in natural VH and VHH domains and thus could not be predicted by studying natural sequences and structures. The results demonstrate that autonomous VH domains with structural properties beyond the scope of natural frameworks can be derived by using non-natural mutations, which differ from those found in camelid VHH domains.

It was long believed that all antibodies are composed of heavy and light chains and consequently that the simplest antigen-binding unit is the variable fragment (Fv), 2The abbreviations used are: Fvvariable fragmentCDRcomplementarity determining regionFabantigen binding fragmentVHheavy chain variable domainVHHheavy chain variable domain of a heavy chain antibodyVLlight chain variable domainWTwild typePDBProtein Data Bank. 2The abbreviations used are: Fvvariable fragmentCDRcomplementarity determining regionFabantigen binding fragmentVHheavy chain variable domainVHHheavy chain variable domain of a heavy chain antibodyVLlight chain variable domainWTwild typePDBProtein Data Bank. a heterodimer of heavy and light chain variable domains (VH and VL, respectively) (1Padlan E.A.

The simplicity of the VHH domain architecture has attracted interest from protein engineers concerned with developing novel antibodies for biotechnological and therapeutic applications. VHH domains are well suited for use as modular building blocks that can be linked together to assemble multivalent or bispecific antibodies (5Els Conrath K. Lauwereys M. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7346-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The third complementarity determining loop (CDR3) of camelid VHH domains is often unusually long, and it has been suggested that these protruding loops may be especially effective for targeting active site clefts (6Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct.

Furthermore, because of their small size, VHH domains are rapidly cleared in vivo and exhibit enhanced tumor penetration, and these properties may be useful for the delivery of toxins for therapy or radioisotopes for imaging (8Cortez-Retamozo V.

Also, unlike most antibody fragments, thermodenaturation of most VHH domains is a fully reversible process, making them well suited for applications where transient heating may occur (12Ewert S. Cambillau C. Conrath K. Pluckthun A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3628-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, considerable effort has been expended on elucidating the structural basis for the autonomous stability and solubility of VHH domains, with the ultimate goal of using these insights to engineer autonomous versions of conventional VH domains. For a conventional VH domain, the major consequence of an absent light chain is the exposure of hydrophobic side chains that are normally buried within the interface. In addition, thermodynamic stability is usually compromised because the stability of most VH domains is augmented by contacts at the light chain interface (13Worn A. Pluckthun A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8739-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The elucidation of a number of camelid VHH domain structures has provided insights into how these challenges to structural integrity are accommodated (6Desmyter A. Transue T.R.

There are a number of hallmark sequence changes in VHH domains relative to conventional VH domains, which function to reduce the hydrophobicity of the former light chain interface. The most common and important changes, dubbed the “VHH tetrad,” occur at four positions in the second framework region (2Holt L.J. Herring C. Jespers L.S. Woolven B.P. Tomlinson I.M. Trends Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 484-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3Muyldermans S. Cambillau C. Wyns L. Trends Biochem.

In most cases, Glu-44 and Arg-45 are found in place of the less hydrophilic Gly-44 and Leu-45 of VH domains, and hydrophilicity at position 47 is also increased by substitution of Trp with smaller residues. The effect of the fourth change is less obvious from the primary sequence alone, as it involves replacement of Val-37 by a more hydrophobic Phe (or sometimes Tyr). However, structural analysis reveals that the Phe/Tyr residue at position 37 of VHH domains nucleates a small hydrophobic core, which also typically involves Tyr-91, Trp-103, the aliphatic portion of Arg-45, and hydrophobic residues in the CDR3 loop. The overall effect of these changes is to increase the hydrophilicity of the former light chain interface, either by direct substitution with more hydrophilic side chains or by sequestration of hydrophobic side chains from solvent by interactions between CDR3 and framework residues (6Desmyter A.

Insights gained from the analysis of camelid VHH domains have been applied to efforts aimed at developing autonomous versions of human VH domains. Even prior to the elucidation of VHH domain three-dimensional structures, attempts were made to produce soluble VH domains by a “camelization” process, which involves transferring elements of the VHH tetrad to a human framework (22Davies J. Riechmann L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It was found that the incorporation of three hydrophilic substitutions (G44E/L45R/W47G) improved solubility, but protein yields and thermodynamic stability were severely compromised. Substitution by Ile rather than Gly at position 47 improved yields and stability but reduced solubility somewhat. Nevertheless, the second variant was soluble enough to enable elucidation of the solution structure by NMR, albeit only in the presence of detergent (23Riechmann L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Riechmann L. Davies J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Frameworks of this type were used to construct phage-displayed libraries of random CDR3 sequences that yielded soluble VH domains with novel antigen specificities (25Davies J. Riechmann L. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The structure of the camelized VH domain revealed deformations in the framework β-sheet, which are likely responsible for reduced stability and protein yields (23Riechmann L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Subsequent attempts at camelization have also been only partially successful because it has been found that the substitutions of the VHH tetrad do not completely alleviate aggregation (26Kortt A.A. Guthrie R.E. Hinds M.G. Power B.E. Ivancic N. Caldwell J.B. Gruen L.C. Norton R.S. Hudson P.J. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Martin F. Volpari C.

Hilvert D. van Gunsteren W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, it was concluded that, although the camelization strategy yielded moderately stable autonomous VH domains, additional factors must be responsible for the stability and solubility of camelid VHH domains (23Riechmann L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In retrospect, it appears that at least one of these additional factors is the requirement for a CDR3 loop that can supply stabilizing hydrophobic interactions with the framework. The importance of this additional requirement has been underscored by a study that showed that random CDR3 loops selected for stabilization of a llama VHH domain contained hydrophobic residues at key positions, and structural analysis showed that a selected CDR3 loop engaged in hydrophobic packing interactions that were similar to those of natural camelid CDR3 loops (29Bond C.J. Marsters J.C. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate a structural role for CDR3 in the stability and solubility of VHH domains, which places additional constraints on the CDR3 sequence. In practical terms, these constraints must be taken into account in the design of camelization strategies, and this limits the diversity of CDR3 sequences that are compatible with the camelid VHH framework. Despite the importance of the VHH tetrad for stabilization of camelid VHH domains, several studies have discovered autonomous VH domains, from camelids and other species, which do not contain these hallmark sequences. Indeed, even prior to the discovery of camelid heavy chain antibodies, it was found that certain mouse VH domains can function autonomously (30Ward E.S. Gussow D. Griffiths A.D. Jones P.T. Winter G. Nature. 1989; 341: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). More recently, an unusual mouse VH domain containing a hydrophilic substitution at the former light chain interface (G44K) has been shown to exist as a stable monomer in solution (31Reiter Y. Schuck P. Boyd L.F. Plaksin D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a phage-displayed library derived from llama yielded seemingly conventional VH domains, which lacked elements of the VHH tetrad but nonetheless could be purified as stable and highly soluble monomers (32Tanha J. Dubuc G. Hirama T. Narang S.A. MacKenzie C.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 263: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phage-displayed selections have shown that human VH domain libraries contain a substantial number of autonomous VH domains with framework sequences typical of conventional antibodies (33Jespers L. Schon O. Famm K. Winter G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 34To R. Hirama T. Arbabi-Ghahroudi M. MacKenzie R. Wang P. Xu P. Ni F. Tanha J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41395-41403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that most vertebrate species likely contain some VH domains that can function autonomously. Although the high sequence diversity among these unusual subpopulations has made it difficult to discern general rules for autonomous VH domain stabilization (32Tanha J. Dubuc G. Hirama T. Narang S.A. MacKenzie C.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 263: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 33Jespers L. Schon O. Famm K. Winter G. Nat.

Schon O. James L.C. Veprintsev D. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Vranken W. Tolkatchev D. Xu P. Tanha J. Chen Z. Narang S. Ni F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8570-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The solution structure of a llama VH domain (BrucD4-4) is similar to those of VHH domains, as the CDR3 loop folds over Val-37 and thus reduces the hydrophobicity of the former light chain interface (36Vranken W. Tolkatchev D. Xu P. Tanha J. Chen Z. Narang S. Ni F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8570-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, this interface may be transient because of the conformational flexibility of CDR3, and overall, the hydrophobicity of the BrucD4-4 surface lies between that of conventional VH domains and autonomous VHH domains. The crystal structure of an anti-lysozyme human VH domain (HEL4) reveals that, although the domain is monomeric in solution, the protein crystallizes as a dimer (35Jespers L. Schon O. James L.C. Veprintsev D. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). HEL4 was derived from a germ line framework by mutations restricted to the three CDR loops, and the structure revealed that a key change in CDR1 is partially responsible for the favorable solution properties of HEL4. It appears that the substitution of His-35 by Gly produces a cavity that serves to bury the side chain of Trp-47, which is flipped relative to its orientation in structures of VH/VL pairs, and this reorganization decreases the hydrophobicity of the former light chain interface. However, because the former light chain interface and CDR3 are involved in crystal packing interactions, it is unclear from the structure whether Trp-47 assumes the same conformation in solution and also whether or not the CDR3 loop plays a stabilizing role similar to that observed in VHH domains. All of the studies reported to date have relied on insights gained from natural antibodies to elucidate features contributing to the autonomous nature of camelid VHH domains and some VH domains. Camelid VHH domains have been studied (4Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S. Robinson G. Hamers C. Songa E.B. Bendahman N. Hamers R.

These studies have revealed that, in general, the stability and solubility of these domains are dependent on CDR3, and this places significant constraints on the types of CDR3 loops that are compatible with autonomous structural integrity. This limitation poses considerable problems for the engineering of autonomous VH domains with novel functions, as CDR3 is the major contributor to most antigen-binding sites, and it has been well established that the success of in vitro antibody libraries depends on the use of highly diverse CDR3 loops (38Barbas C.F.

Thus, for the purposes of antibody engineering, it would be most advantageous to use VH domain scaffolds that exhibit the autonomous behavior of camelid VHH domains, but they do so without reliance on the CDR3 loop. Here we have gone beyond the limits of natural antibody diversity to explore the issue of autonomous VH domains from a strictly biophysical perspective. Using combinatorial selections followed up by conventional biophysical methods, we scanned the entire former light chain interface and CDR3 to assess the compatibility of different framework and CDR3 combinations with autonomous stability. With this comprehensive approach, we confirm that the evolution of autonomous VH domains from VH/VL pairs depends on mutations that are well tolerated structurally and increase the hydrophilicity of the former light chain interface. However, we find that many sequences that improve the stability and solubility of autonomous VH domains are rare in natural VHH and VH domains. Furthermore, we isolated numerous autonomous VH domains whose structural stability does not depend on the CDR3 loop. Thus, our findings demonstrate that autonomous VH domains with structural properties beyond the scope of natural frameworks can be derived by the incorporation of substitutions that are rare in nature but, nonetheless, are structurally compatible with the VH domain fold. These results open the door to the development of libraries of synthetic VH domains with CDR3 diversities unconstrained by structural demands. Library Construction and AnalysisFor the phage display of VH-4D5, a phagemid (pPAB43778) was constructed from a previously described phagemid (pS1602) (43Sidhu S.S. Weiss G.A. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) by inserting a DNA fragment encoding VH-4D5 in place of the region encoding human growth hormone. Phage-displayed libraries were constructed using methods described previously (29Bond C.J. Marsters J.C. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol.

For library A, NNS degenerate codons were used (N = A/G/C/T and S = G/C). For library B, degenerate mutagenic oligonucleotides contained ∼70% of the wild-type nucleotide and 10% each of the three other nucleotides at each randomized position. For shotgun alanine scanning, codons were designed as described (46Weiss G.A. Watanabe C.K. Zhong A. Goddard A. Sidhu S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For quantitative saturation scanning, NNK codons were used (K = G/T), and two separate libraries were constructed; one library randomized positions 35, 39, 45, and 50, and the other randomized positions 37, 44, 47, 91, and 105. Library phage pools were cycled through rounds of binding selection against protein A (Sigma) immobilized on NUNC 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates, as described (29Bond C.J. Marsters J.C. Sidhu S.S. J.

Eluted phage were amplified in Escherichia coli XL1-blue (Stratagene) with the addition of M13-KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs) and used for further rounds of selection.

Here we demonstrate that Wnt signaling by osteoblasts is essential for mesenchymal progenitor cells to differentiate away from a default adipogenic into an osteoblastic lineage. Dominant adipogenesis and reduced osteoblastogenesis were observed in calvarial cell cultures from transgenic mice characterized by osteoblast-targeted disruption of glucocorticoid signaling. This phenotypic shift in mesenchymal progenitor cell commitment was associated with reciprocal regulation of early adipogenic and osteoblastogenic transcription factors and with a reduction in Wnt7b and Wnt10b mRNA and β-catenin protein levels in transgenic versus non-transgenic cultures. Transwell co-culture of transgenic mesenchymal progenitor cells with wild type osteoblasts restored commitment to the osteoblast lineage. This effect was blocked by adding sFRP1, a Wnt inhibitor, to the co-culture. Treatment of transgenic cultures with Wnt3a resulted in stimulation of osteoblastogenesis and suppression of adipogenesis. Our findings suggest a novel cellular mechanism in bone cell biology in which osteoblasts exert direct control over the lineage commitment of their mesenchymal progenitor through Wnt signaling. This glucocorticoid-dependent forward control function indicates a central role for osteoblasts in the regulation of early osteoblastogenesis.

This glucocorticoid-dependent forward control function indicates a central role for osteoblasts in the regulation of early osteoblastogenesis. Mesenchymal stem cells are able to differentiate to multiple connective tissue and musculoskeletal cell types under the control of specific transcription factors directing their lineage commitment. For example, osteoblasts and adipocytes share a common mesenchymal cell progenitor that can be isolated from neonatal mouse or fetal rat calvaria (1Bellows C.G. Heersche J.N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Primary cell cultures derived from these tissues can differentiate into osteoblasts or adipocytes. The differentiation of these mesenchymal progenitors into osteoblasts or adipocytes is governed by the expression of the master transcription factors runt-related gene 2 (Runx2) (2Ducy P. Zhang R.

Glucocorticoid (GC) signaling through its cognate receptor is known to influence osteoblast and adipocyte lineage commitment both in vitro and in vivo and is, thus, likely to have a role in regulating cellular interactions driving cell commitment. In addition, specific enzymes modulate GC metabolism within the cell at the pre-receptor level (4Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 249-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 5Draper N. Stewart P.M. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 186: 251-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Within certain tissues, two isoforms of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11βHSD) vary intracellular GC concentrations independent of circulating GC levels. 11βHSD type 1 (11βHSD1) predominantly converts inactive cortisone to active cortisol to increase intracellular GC concentrations; in contrast, 11βHSD type 2 (11βHSD2) unidirectionally catalyzes the conversion of active GC to their inactive metabolites (4Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 249-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Kream and co-workers (6Kalajzic Z. Liu P. Kalajzic I. Du Z. Braut A. Mina M. Canalis E. Rowe D.W. Bone (NY). 2002; 31: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) generated a Col2.3–11βHSD2 transgenic (tg) mouse in which the rat gene for 11βHSD2 was linked to the 2.3-kilobase collagen type I (Col2.3) promoter to target transgene expression to mature osteoblasts (6Kalajzic Z.

The Col2.3 promoter has been well characterized and specifically targets gene expression to mature osteoblasts (7Kalajzic I. Kalajzic Z. Kaliterna M. Gronowicz G. Clark S.H. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D. J.

Green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice using the same fragment of the type I collagen promoter to drive GFP expression (2.3Col-GFP) demonstrated that only cells with features of mature osteoblasts show fluorescence in vivo and in vitro (7Kalajzic I.

Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 5-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microarray analysis data on this population of GFP-positive cells show it to be highly enriched for expression of mature osteoblast-specific genes such as osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein (BSP), and dentin matrix protein-1 (8Kalajzic I.

Similarly, immunohistochemistry studies localized transgenic 11βHSD2 protein expression to mature osteoblasts and osteocytes in the bones of transgenic mice with no expression in bones derived from wild type littermates. Transgenic 11βHSD2 enzyme activity was confirmed in vitro by measuring the conversion of [3H]corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone (11Sher L.B. Woitge H.W. Adams D.J. Gronowicz G.A. Krozowski Z. Harrison J.R. Kream B.E. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because overexpression of HSD2 results in the inactivation of cytoplasmic GCs, GC signaling is, thus, effectively disrupted in mature osteoblasts (11Sher L.B. Woitge H.W. Adams D.J. Gronowicz G.A.

Col2.3–11βHSD2 transgenic mice have been shown to exhibit vertebral osteopenia in females (11Sher L.B. Woitge H.W. Adams D.J. Gronowicz G.A. Krozowski Z. Harrison J.R. Kream B.E. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), reduced femoral cortical bone area and thickness, and impaired mineralized nodule formation in primary calvarial cultures. However, the mechanism underlying these phenotypic changes remained unclear (12Sher L.B. Harrison J.R. Adams D.J. Kream B.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2006; 79: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Others have targeted 11βHSD2 overexpression to osteoblasts/osteocytes with the osteocalcin gene 2 promoter. These transgenic mice had no discernible bone phenotype, but osteocyte viability was protected during GC treatment (13O'Brien C.A. Jia D. Plotkin L.I. Bellido T. Powers C.C. Stewart S.A.

In the present study using primary calvarial cell cultures derived from the Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg mice, we discovered a novel mechanism in which fully differentiated osteoblasts control lineage commitment and differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells. We find that GC-regulated Wnt signaling is a strong candidate for mediating this function. Transgenic Mice—Col2.3–11βHSD2 transgenic mice were generated as described previously (11Sher L.B. Woitge H.W. Adams D.J. Gronowicz G.A. Krozowski Z. Harrison J.R. Kream B.E. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and were provided as a gift by Dr. Barbara Kream (Dept. of Medicine, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT). Col2.3-GFP mice (7Kalajzic I. Kalajzic Z. Kaliterna M. Gronowicz G. Clark S.H. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) were provided as a gift by Dr. David Rowe (Dept. of Genetics and Developmental Biology, University of Connecticut Health Center). Mice were maintained at the animal facilities of the ANZAC Research Institute (Sydney, Australia) in accordance with Institutional Animal Welfare Guidelines and according to an approved protocol. Primary Calvaria Cell Culture—Primary calvaria cells were generated from 1-day-old wild type (WT) or Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg littermates. Cells were released by 4 sequential 10-min digestions with 0.1% collagenase (Worthington Biomedical Co., Lakewood, NJ) and 0.2% dispase (Invitrogen). Cell populations from digestions 2 to 4 were collected and pooled (P2–4). For mineralized nodule formation assays, cells were cultured in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105/well in α-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and cortisol at a concentration of 8 × 10–9 m (derived from the FBS). Cells were allowed to attach for 24 h, and then osteogenic conditions were provided to induce osteoblast differentiation (designated day0) by adding ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml; Sigma) and β-glycerophosphate (10 mm; Sigma). Cells were incubated for 14 days with fresh medium provided three times weekly. Transwell Co-culture—Calvaria cells were isolated by sequential enzyme digestion yielding four populations (1Bellows C.G. Heersche J.N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells collected from the first digestion, designated population 1 (P1), were cultured in 24-well plates. Cells collected from third and fourth digestions were pooled and designated as populations 3 and 4 (P3–4). This population or cells was cultured in transwell inserts (pore size 3 μm, BD Biosciences) overnight and then were transferred in the inserts to the 24-well plates containing P1 cells. Osteogenic conditions were then provided in the cultures by adding ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate as above, and cultures were maintained for 21 days. To evaluate the potential role for secreted Wnt proteins in the transwell system, secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) (R&D Systems) was added at a concentration of 200 ng/ml to the media, which was changed every second day. Cell inserts were then removed from plates, and P1 cells were fixed and stained for mineralized nodules and adipocyte lipids. Staining—Mineralized nodules were assessed by staining with 1% alizarin red (Sigma) after fixation in 70% ethanol (14Stanford C.M. Jacobson P.A. Eanes E.D. Lembke L.A. Midura R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9420-9428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The nodules were then imaged by scanner and were analyzed using image analysis software (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health) to determine the number and area of mineralized nodules. Adipocyte lipid was assessed by staining cells with Oil Red O (Sigma) after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. The Oil Red O-stained adipocytes were counted in each well in a standard area of 157 mm2. Staining by Oil Red O was further quantified by spectrophotometry. Briefly, the stained dishes were rinsed free of residue stain and eluted with 1 ml of 100% isopropanol for 20 min at room temperature. Three aliquots (100 μl) of the eluate were transferred to a 96-well plate and quantified by absorbance measurement at 490 nm (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The linear range of detection was determined by standard solutions of Oil Red O. Wnt3a-conditioned Medium—Cell lines of murine subcutaneous connective tissue-derived L-fibroblasts permanently transfected with Wnt3a (L-Wnt3a) or an empty vector (L) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). Control and Wnt3a-conditioned media were prepared from Land L-Wnt3a cells, respectively, as described by the ATCC. Briefly, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 3 days, after which conditioned medium was collected, filter-sterilized, and stored at –70 °C until further use. RT-PCR and Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from primary mouse calvaria cell cultures of populations P1 and P2–4 using NucleoSpin (Machery-Nagel, Easton, PA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA by incubating for 1 h at 50°C with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) after oligo(dT) priming. The sequences of primers were used are listed in Table 1. PCR was conducted for 20–30 cycles, each of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s.

Kitamura M. Hardy S. Kitajewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2474-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, primary calvaria cells derived from 1-day-old WT and tg mice were cultured in osteogenic media for 7 days. Total cellular protein was isolated from cell lysates in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 40 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, protease inhibitor, Roche Applied Science). To isolate nuclear extract (16van den Brink G.R. Bleuming S.A. Hardwick J.C. Schepman B.L. Offerhaus G.J. Keller J.J. Nielsen C. Gaffield W. van Deventer S.J. Roberts D.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer, cell lysates were passed through a 27-gauge needle and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was recovered as the cytoplasmic fraction. The remaining pellet containing the nuclear fraction was spun for an additional 15 min at 15,000 × g, washed with lysis buffer, and resuspended in sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitor). Both cellular and nuclear proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide) and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were immunoblotted with anti-β-catenin antibody (BD Biosciences) at a 1:500 dilution or anti-β-actin antibody (BD Biosciences) at a 1:2000 dilution as an internal control. Protein expression was visualized with a peroxidase-labeled sheep antimouse secondary antibody by enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and by exposure to x-ray film. Statistical Analysis—Data are represented as the means ± S.E. of the mean, and statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test. For multiple comparisons the p value was adjusted using the Bonferroni method. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Osteoblast Differentiation Is Inhibited, and Adipocyte Differentiation Is Increased in Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg Culture—Primary osteoblast cultures were generated from the calvaria of 1-day-old Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg mice and WT littermates and grown under osteogenic conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cultures derived from Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg mice exhibited a 60% reduction in mineralized nodule formation when compared with WT cultures (Fig. 1, A and B). In the same cultures, a significant increase in adipocyte numbers was observed when compared with WT cultures, in which only a few adipocytes formed (Fig. 1C). The Oil Red O content of cultures was found to be at least 2 times higher in tg cultures compared with WT cultures (Oil Red O elution A490: WT 0.21 ± 0.01, tg 0.47 ± 0.03, p < 0.001). In light of the fact that the transgene is exclusively expressed in mature osteoblasts (7Kalajzic I. Kalajzic Z. Kaliterna M. Gronowicz G. Clark S.H. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 11Sher L.B. Woitge H.W. Adams D.J. Gronowicz G.A. Krozowski Z. Harrison J.R. Kream B.E. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 922-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), these results indicate that early precursor cells derived from transgenic, 11βHSD2-overexpressing animals experience a major shift in lineage commitment from osteoblast to adipocyte. The Shift in Lineage Commitment Is Due to Disrupted GC Signaling in Mature Osteoblasts—11βHSD2 mRNA expression was only detected in Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg cultures. WT cultures expressed neither rat transgene or native mouse 11βHSD2 (primers used could detect both rat transgene and native mouse 11βHSD2). Increased 11βHSD2 expression levels were observed in tg cultures from day 3 to day 7; this finding is consistent with the expected increase in the number of differentiated osteoblasts during culture (Fig. 2, A and B). mRNA for 11βHSD1 was expressed at very low levels and similarly in tg and WT cultures, with a minor increase at day 7. Thus, 11βHSD2 is the major enzyme regulating GC signaling in cultures derived from Col2.3–11βHSD2 animals, and the expression of 11βHSD1 is not regulated by 11βHSD2. mRNA for the glucocorticoid receptor was similarly expressed in both WT and tg cultures and was not regulated by 11βHSD2 (data not shown). The increase in 11βHSD2 mRNA was accompanied by a reciprocal decrease in mRNA for serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase, a GC target gene (17Chen S.Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Verrey F. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2514-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), indicating that GC signaling is attenuated in Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg cultures (Fig. 2C). Thiram, a dithiocarbamate that inhibits 11βHSD2 but not 11βHSD1 enzyme activity (18Atanasov A.G. Tam S. Rocken J.M. Baker M.E. Odermatt A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was added to WT and tg cultures. At a concentration of 10–10 m, Thiram increased mineralized nodule formation to levels seen in WT cultures. In the same cultures, Thiram dose-dependently inhibited adipocyte formation (Fig. 2F). Thiram had no effect on WT cultures at any concentration used (Fig. 2, D–F). Hence, the Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg culture phenotype could be completely reversed by blocking 11βHSD2 enzyme activity in the culture system. Taken together, these results indicate that the shift in lineage commitment from osteoblast to adipocyte in tg cultures is due to disrupted GC signaling in mature osteoblasts overexpressing 11βHSD2. Corticosterone or dexamethasone, substrates for 11βHSD2 (19Ferrari P. Smith R.E. Funder J.W. Krozowski Z.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E900-E904PubMed Google Scholar, 20Woitge H. Harrison J. Ivkosic A. Krozowski Z. Kream B. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), were added to tg and WT cultures at concentrations of 10–10–10–7 m. As expected, neither steroid had any effect at low concentrations (10–10–10–8 m), but each inhibited mineralized nodule formation at a high concentrations (10–7 m) in both WT and tg cultures (data not shown). Transcription Factors for Osteoblasts and Adipocytes Are Reciprocally Regulated in Col2.3–11βHSD2 Transgenic Culture—mRNA expression of three markers for osteoblast differentiation (alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin) was similar in Col2.3–11β-HSD2 tg and WT cultures at day 1, indicating that the cell populations at the start of culture are nearly identical in both WT and tg cultures. However, at day 3 expression of each of these genes was markedly reduced in tg cultures compared with WT cultures, a finding that is consistent with inhibition of osteoblast differentiation (Fig. 3A). Expression of osteoblast-associated transcription factors, such as Runx2, increased with time in the WT cultures but remained substantially lower in tg cultures (Fig. 3, B and C). The expression of other osteoblast transcription factors, Twist2, Dlx5, and Osterix, were also lower in transgenic cultures after 7 days of differentiation (Fig. 3D). Conversely, mRNA expression of the adipogenic transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and PPARγ was increased at day 3 in Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg cultures but not in WT cultures (Fig. 3, B and C). These results indicate that disrupting GC signaling in osteoblasts affects mesenchymal precursor cell differentiation at a very early stage and promotes adipogenic differentiation. We, therefore, hypothesized the existence of a GC-regulated “paracrine” signal between mature osteoblasts and their mesenchymal progenitors that influences lineage commitment. We investigated this hypothesis further in transwell co-culture experiments. Osteoblastic Cells Produce Paracrine Factor(s) That Promote Osteoblastogenesis and Inhibit Adipogenesis—To define the cell populations representing early precursor cells and osteoblasts, we used calvarial cells derived from Col2.3-GFP tg mice in which GFP is driven by the same promoter as used for the 11βHSD2 transgene (7Kalajzic I. Kalajzic Z. Kaliterna M. Gronowicz G. Clark S.H. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Calvarial cells from the first digestion were designated as P1; these cells were negative for the GFP signal after 7 days of induction of differentiation (Fig. 4A). The cells from later digestions, designated P3–4, showed few GFP-positive cells at day 1 but numerous cells differentiating into GFP-positive, mature osteoblasts at day 7 (Fig. 4A) These findings confirm that at the start of culture induction, P1 mainly contains early mesenchymal precursors, whereas P3–4 is rich in committed osteoblastic precursors that later differentiate into osteoblasts (21Suda N. Gillespie M.T. Traianedes K. Zhou H. Ho P.W. Hards D.K. Allan E.H. Martin T.J. Moseley J.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We then isolated the P1 cell population from Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg mice and their WT littermates and found that these cells did not form mineralized nodules in either WT or Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg cultures after 21 days (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, cells from P3–4 populations formed many mineralized nodules in WT and tg cultures, although numbers were significantly lower in tg cultures (data not shown). P1 cells were then co-cultured with P3–4 cells of the same or reciprocal genotype seeded in the transwell inserts (Fig. 4B). P3–4 cells from WT mice induced nodule formation in cultures of both WT and Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg P1 cells. In contrast, P3–4 cells from tg mice failed to induce mineralized nodules in either WT or tg P1 cells (Fig. 4, B and C). P1 cells, without co-culture, readily differentiated into adipocytes at comparable levels in both WT and Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg cultures (Fig. 4D). In the co-cultures, adipocyte formation in WT or tg P1 cells was inhibited by about 90% by P3–4 cells derived from WT mice (Fig. 4D). These results clearly demonstrate that osteoblastic cells from WT mice produce soluble factor(s) that act on the precursor cells to promote osteoblastogenesis and inhibit adipogenesis. Although P3–4 cells from Col2.3–11β HSD2 tg mice failed to induce osteoblast differentiation (Fig. 4, B and C), a significant reduction in the number of adipocytes was observed in both WT and Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg P1 cells (Fig. 4D), although this effect was reduced relative to that seen with WT P3–4 cells. P1 cells derived from WT or Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg mice cultured alone formed similar numbers of adipocytes and had similar numbers of mineralized nodules induced by WT P3–4 cells (Fig. 4, C and D). This again suggests that both WT and Col2.3–11βHSD2 tg cultures consisted of similar cell populations and that P1 cells from WT and tg mice had the same potential to differentiate into either adipocytes or osteoblasts, depending on the strength of the signals received. Osteoblasts Control the Fate of Their Mesenchymal Precursors via the Canonical Wnt Signaling Pathway—The Wnt family consists of a large number of secreted glycoprotein-signaling molecules that are involved in regulating cell differentiation (22Cadigan K.M.

https://openalex.org/W2002772218,"Mammalian odorant receptors (ORs) are crucial for establishing the functional organization of the olfactory system, but the mechanisms controlling their expression remain largely unexplained. Here, we utilized a transgenic approach to explore OR gene regulation. We determined that although olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are capable of supporting expression of multiple functional ORs, several levels of control ensure that each neuron normally expresses only a single odorant receptor. Surprisingly, this regulation extends beyond endogenous ORs even preventing expression of transgenes consisting of OR-coding sequences driven by synthetic promoters. Thus, part of the intrinsic feedback system must rely on elements present in the OR-coding sequence. Notably, by expressing the same transgenic ORs precociously in immature neurons, we have overcome this suppression and established a generic method to express any OR in approximately 90% of OSNs. These results provide important insights into the hierarchy of OR gene expression and the vital role of the OR-coding sequence in this regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1971316888,"How often insecticide resistance mutations arise in natural insect populations is a fundamental question for understanding the evolution of resistance and also for modeling its spread. Moreover, the development of resistance is regarded as a favored model to study the molecular evolution of adaptive traits. In the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae two point mutations (L1014F and L1014S) in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene, that confer knockdown resistance (kdr) to DDT and pyrethroid insecticides, have been described. In order to determine whether resistance alleles result from single or multiple mutation events, genotyping of the kdr locus and partial sequencing of the upstream intron-1 was performed on a total of 288 A. gambiae S-form collected from 28 localities in 15 countries. Knockdown resistance alleles were found to be widespread in West Africa with co-occurrence of both 1014S and 1014F in West-Central localities. Differences in intron-1 haplotype composition suggest that kdr alleles may have arisen from at least four independent mutation events. Neutrality tests provided evidence for a selective sweep acting on this genomic region, particularly in West Africa. The frequency and distribution of these kdr haplotypes varied geographically, being influenced by an interplay between different mutational occurrences, gene flow and local selection. This has important practical implications for the management and sustainability of malaria vector control programs."
https://openalex.org/W2026164300,"ESA's Venus Express probe has been in orbit since April 2006. Eight research papers in this issue present new results from the mission, covering the atmosphere, polar features, interactions with the solar wind and the controversial matter of venusian lightning. Håkan Svedham et al. open the section with a review of the similarities and (mostly) differences between Venus and its 'twin', the Earth. Andrew Ingersoll considers the latest results, and also how the project teams plan to make the most of the probe's remaining six years of life. Venus has a bright 'dipole' double-eye feature at the centre of a vast vortex that rotates around the north pole, and is surrounded by a cold 'collar'. Observations of Venus' south polar region are reported, where clouds with morphology much like those around the north pole are seen, but rotating somewhat faster. Venus has no seasons, slow rotation and a very massive atmosphere, which is mainly carbon dioxide with clouds primarily of sulphuric acid droplets. Infrared observations by previous missions to Venus revealed a bright ‘dipole’ feature surrounded by a cold ‘collar’ at its north pole1,2,3,4. The polar dipole is a ‘double-eye’ feature at the centre of a vast vortex that rotates around the pole, and is possibly associated with rapid downwelling. The polar cold collar is a wide, shallow river of cold air that circulates around the polar vortex. One outstanding question has been whether the global circulation was symmetric, such that a dipole feature existed at the south pole. Here we report observations of Venus’ south-polar region, where we have seen clouds with morphology much like those around the north pole, but rotating somewhat faster than the northern dipole. The vortex may extend down to the lower cloud layers that lie at about 50 km height and perhaps deeper. The spectroscopic properties of the clouds around the south pole are compatible with a sulphuric acid composition."

https://openalex.org/W2073550373,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus encodes several RNA-processing enzymes that are unusual for RNA viruses, including Nsp15 (nonstructural protein 15), a hexameric endoribonuclease that preferentially cleaves 3' of uridines. We solved the structure of a catalytically inactive mutant version of Nsp15, which was crystallized as a hexamer. The structure contains unreported flexibility in the active site of each subunit. Substitutions in the active site residues serine 293 and proline 343 allowed Nsp15 to cleave at cytidylate, whereas mutation of leucine 345 rendered Nsp15 able to cleave at purines as well as pyrimidines. Mutations that targeted the residues involved in subunit interactions generally resulted in the formation of catalytically inactive monomers. The RNA-binding residues were mapped by a method linking reversible cross-linking, RNA affinity purification, and peptide fingerprinting. Alanine substitution of several residues in the RNA-contacting portion of Nsp15 did not affect hexamer formation but decreased the affinity of RNA binding and reduced endonuclease activity. This suggests a model for Nsp15 hexamer interaction with RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2022386678,"Potyvirus genome linked protein, VPg, interacts with translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIFiso4E, but its role in protein synthesis has not been elucidated. We show that addition of VPg to wheat germ extract leads to enhancement of uncapped viral mRNA translation and inhibition of capped viral mRNA translation. This provides a significant competitive advantage to the uncapped viral mRNA. To understand the molecular basis of these effects, we have characterized the interaction of VPg with eIF4F, eIFiso4F, and a structured RNA derived from tobacco etch virus (TEV RNA). When VPg formed a complex with eIF4F, the affinity for TEV RNA increased more than 4-fold compared with eIF4F alone (19.4 and 79.0 nm, respectively). The binding affinity of eIF4F to TEV RNA correlates with translation efficiency. VPg enhanced eIFiso4F binding to TEV RNA 1.6-fold (178 nm compared with 108 nm). Kinetic studies of eIF4F and eIFiso4F with VPg show ∼2.6-fold faster association for eIFiso4F·VPg as compared with eIF4F·VPg. The dissociation rate was ∼2.9-fold slower for eIFiso4F than eIF4F with VPg. These data demonstrate that eIFiso4F can kinetically compete with eIF4F for VPg binding.

The cap serves as the binding site for initiation factors eIF4F or eIFiso4F, an isozyme form of eIF4F present in higher plants, either of which is involved in the assembly of the initiation complex. Alternative translation mechanisms have been shown to take place under a unique set of circumstances. One such example is that of viral infection. Viruses employ different strategies for preferential translation of their mRNAs often using internal ribosome entry sites (IRES).Recently attention has focused on the possible role in translation initiation of the viral protein linked to the genome (VPg) of potyvirus (1Goodfellow I.

Plant-Microbe Interact. 1998; 11: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Wheat germ and other plants express two related but distinct forms of the cap-binding protein designated as eIF4F and eIFiso4F (16Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each consists of two subunits, eIF4E and eIF4G and subunit eIFiso4E and eIFiso4G. The amino acid sequence of eIFiso4E, the cap-binding subunit, is ∼50% similar to eIF4E from wheat and (∼38%) similar to the cap-binding proteins from yeast and mammals and retains all of the reported conserved tryptophan residues (17Allen M.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Wheat germ eIFiso4F can substitute for mammaliane IF4F with respect to supporting RNA-dependent ATPase activity and in cross-linking of mammalian eIF4A to the cap of oxidized mRNA (19Abramson R.D.

The two plant proteins (eIF4F and eIFiso4F) have a number of functional similarities in that both support translation in vitro and facilitate ATP-dependent helicase activity (19Abramson R.D.

A. 1985; 82: 330-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). eIF4F was found to support translation of RNA containing secondary structure in the noncoding region in a more efficient manner than did eIFiso4F (23Gallie D.R. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36951-36960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, binding studies with oligonucleotides suggest that eIF4F exhibits binding preference for secondary structure and that eIFiso4F prefers linear structures (24Carberry S.E. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4542-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that in vitro translation using the tobacco etch virus 5′-leader, which contains an internal ribosome entry site, to direct cap-independent translation specifically depended on eIF4G and not eIFiso4G (25Gallie D.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12141-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Direct binding studies showed that binding affinity of eIF4G and eIFiso4G correlated with translational efficiency (26Ray S. Yumak H. Domashevskiy A. Khan M.A. Gallie D.R. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35826-35834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Robaglia and Caranta (27Robaglia C. Caranta C. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 40-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) showed the importance of the link between translation initiation factors eIF4E, eIF4G, and plant RNA virus infection. These observations suggest VPg is important in initiation of protein synthesis, perhaps functioning as a cap analogue, as proposed by Herbert et al. (28Herbert T.P. Brierley I. Brown T.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). VPg not covalently attached to the viral RNA is present at least in some viral stages (29Riechmann J.L. Lain S. Garcia J.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and may affect translation. Earlier studies (4Khan M.A. Miyoshi H. Ray S. Natsuaki T. Suehiro N. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28002-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Miyoshi H. Suehiro N. Tomoo K. Muto S. Takahashi T. Tsukamoto T. Ohmori T. Natsuaki T. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have shown that VPg and cap bind competitively to plant eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F. Whether this contributes to a direct role of VPg in translation or acts as a mechanism for competitive inhibition of host cell initiation factors has not been elucidated. The observation (26Ray S. Yumak H. Domashevskiy A. Khan M.A. Gallie D.R. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35826-35834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that translation of TEV RNA requires eIF4G and not eIFiso4G raises the possibility that the eIFiso4F·VPg interaction does not have a direct role in translation. To further understand the potential role of VPg in translation initiation, we have investigated the interaction of VPg with eIF4F and the effects of this interaction on TEV binding and translation in vitro. The kinetics of binding eIFiso4F to VPg led us to propose a mechanism where VPg substituted for the cap and enhanced formation of an eIFiso4F complex with the IRES (4Khan M.A. Miyoshi H. Ray S. Natsuaki T. Suehiro N. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28002-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this report we show that VPg has an even stronger effect on eIF4F, enhancing the interaction with TEV IRES about 4-fold. Furthermore, the addition of VPg to an in vitro translation system increased translation of an uncapped TEV RNA construct by almost 3-fold. Taken together with our earlier data (4Khan M.A. Miyoshi H. Ray S. Natsuaki T. Suehiro N. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28002-28010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), these results suggest direct participation of VPg in translation initiation by increasing the affinity of eIF4F for TEV IRES and, thus, confers a competitive advantage.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Wheat germ (partially crushed) was purchased from Bob's Red Mill, Natural Foods, Inc. (Milwaukie, OR) and was stored at –20 °C until used. The TuMV VPg full-length cDNA clone and construction of the expression vector for TuMV VPg was described previously (30Miyoshi H. Suehiro N.

Virol. 2004; 85: 2087-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). diethylaminoethylcellulose was purchased from Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, England. Sephadex G-25 was purchased from GE Healthcare. m7GTP-Sepharose and glutathione-Sepharose-4B were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow was purchased from Qiagen. The HiTrap SP, HiTrap Mono Q Column, and PreScission Protease were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The pET21a and pET28a expression vectors were purchased from Novagen, an affiliate of Merck. Luciferin was obtained from Promega, Madison, WI.Purification of Proteins—Wheat germ eIF4F was isolated from the 0–40% ammonium sulfate fraction of the 120 mm KCl post-ribosomal supernatant fraction as described previously (32Lax S.R. Lauer S.J. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 109-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The eIF4G was obtained from a plasmid expressed in Escherichia coli as described elsewhere (33van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some samples of eIF4G were generously provided by Dr. Karen Browning (University of Texas, Austin, TX).The recombinant proteins, eIF4E, eIFiso4E, and eIFiso4G contained in pET3d vector constructs were expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS E. coli as described elsewhere (33van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Protein was eluted from the m7GTP column with buffer B-50 containing 100 mm GTP. After purification, the purity was confirmed by 10% SDS-PAGE. All steps were carried out in a cold box at ∼4 °C.Construction of Expression Vector for Wild Type VPg and N-terminal-truncated VPg71—The TuMV VPg gene was amplified by PCR from the TuMV cDNA clone using primer 3 (5′-AGAATTCATATGGCGAAAGGCAAGGGCAAAGA-3′) and primer 4 (5′-AAAGTCGACTCGAGCTCGTGGTCCACTGGGACGG-3′). The resultant product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into the same sites in pET21a to create an expression vector with a His6 tagged to the C terminus of VPg (VPg-His6) and named pETVPg1. The TuMV VPg gene was amplified by PCR from a TuMV cDNA clone using primer 5 (5′-AAACATATGTCTGCTGTTCGTTTTGTGAT-3′) and primer 4. The resultant product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into the same sites in pET21a to create an expression vector for His6 tagged to the C terminus of N-terminal 70 amino acids truncated VPg (VPg71-His6) and named pETVPg70. All of the expression vector constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Expression and Purification of Wild Type (wt) VPg-His6 and VPg71-His6—Purification of wt VPg was as previously described (30Miyoshi H. Suehiro N. Tomoo K. Muto S. Takahashi T. Tsukamoto T. Ohmori T. Natsuaki T. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). VPg71 is a truncated variant of wt VPg where the N-terminal amino acids 1–70 are removed. The VPg71 variant protein was expressed and purified as described above for wt VPg. The purity of the wt VPg-His6 and VPg71-His6 was confirmed by 15% SDS-PAGE.All samples were dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol) and passed through a 0.22 μm filter (Millipore) before the spectroscopy measurements were performed. The samples were concentrated with a Centricon 10 (Amicon Co.) as necessary. The concentrations of protein were determined by a Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as standard (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad).In Vitro Transcription—The tobacco etch virus (TEV1–143-luc-A50) luciferase construct containing the 143-nucleotide TEV leader sequence, a luciferase reporter gene, and terminating in a poly(A)50 tract has been described previously (7Niepel M. Gallie D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9080-9088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TEV1–143 sequence contains an IRES (7Niepel M. Gallie D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9080-9088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar construct designated TEVS1–3-luc-A50 described previously (35Zeenko V. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26813-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was also used. TEVS1–3 has a reversed stem 1 in the pseudoknot, changing the base sequence but not the base pairing. This construct does not efficiently support cap-independent translation. The same procedure as described previously for TEV1–143 RNA (26Ray S. Yumak H. Domashevskiy A. Khan M.A. Gallie D.R. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35826-35834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was used to produces uncapped TEVS1–3 RNA. The capped RNA was synthesized with 10 μg of template in the same reaction mixture as described for uncapped RNA synthesis except that GTP used was 3 mm, and 40 mm m7GpppG was included in the reaction mixture. Under these conditions more than 90% of the mRNA was capped. The concentration of RNA was determined by measuring the optical density at 260 nm. The purity of synthesized RNA was confirmed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and measuring the absorbance ratio A260/A280 nm in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water.In Vitro Translation Assay—Wheat germ extract was isolated as described previously (36Anderson C.W. Straus J.W. Dudock B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For extract depleted in cap binding complex, wheat germ extract (200 μl) was mixed with m7GTP-Sepharose-4B resin (300 μl) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with continuous mixing. The lysate was collected by high speed centrifugation. The resin was washed with 500 μl of buffer B-40 followed by resuspension of the resin in buffer B-40 containing 100 mm GTP. The GTP eluted fractions (eIF4E, eIF4G, eIFiso4E, and eIFiso4G depleted from wheat germ extract) were verified by running 10% SDS-PAGE. Translation was determined in luciferase assay buffer (25 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA supplemented with 33 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm coenzyme A, and 0.5 mm ATP) for luciferase activity. A 1.0-μg sample of TEV1–143-luc-A50 RNA or TEVS1–3-luc-A50 was translated in a 200-μl reaction mixture containing 50 μl of complete or depleted wheat germ extract, 50 units of RNase inhibitor, and a 10 μm complete amino acid mixture (Promega). Luciferase activity for brome mosaic virus RNA provided by Promega was used as a control. Different concentrations of wt VPg or VPg71 variant protein were added to the translation mixture as described under “Results.” Depleted wheat germ lysates were supplemented with initiation factors eIF4F and eIFiso4F, purified from wheat germ extract and recombinant initiation factors. Translational activity of recombinant eIFs was the same or better than factors isolated from wheat germ. 3K. Browning, personal communication. The optimum concentration of eIF4F/iso4F added to the depleted lysate was 10 nm. Additional protein did not significantly increase translation. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 22 °C, and light emission was measured after the addition of 0.5 mm luciferin.Steady State Fluorescence Measurements—Steady state fluorescence measurements were performed using a Spex Fluorolog τ2 spectrofluorimeter equipped with excitation and emission polarizers. The formation of the binary protein-protein and protein-RNA complexes were studied by direct fluorescence titration using a 10-mm path length quartz cuvette. The excitation wavelength for eIF4F and eIFiso4F was 280 nm, and emission was monitored at 332 nm. The excitation and emission slits were 4 and 5 nm, respectively. The excitation slits were chosen to avoid photobleaching, and the absorbance of the sample at the excitation wavelength was less than 0.02 to minimize the inner-filter effect. Emission spectra were corrected for the wavelength-dependent lamp intensity and monochromator sensitivities. Titrations were performed in 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (titration buffer). The sample temperature was maintained at 25 °C for all experiments unless otherwise stated. For each data point three samples were prepared. The fluorescence intensity of a solution containing 100 nm eIF4F was measured. A second sample with a specific amount of VPg protein was also measured, and the corrected intensities of the two samples were summed together (Fs). A third sample containing the same amount of eIF4F and VPg protein was mixed together, and the corrected fluorescence intensity for this complex was obtained (Fc). The difference in fluorescence intensity related to the complex was defined as ΔF = Fc – Fs. Similar measurements were also done for the interaction of eIFiso4F and VPg titrations. The inner filter correction for the TEV RNA experiment was performed as described previously (26Ray S. Yumak H. Domashevskiy A. Khan M.A. Gallie D.R. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35826-35834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using the equation (37Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1999: 54Google Scholar), Fcorr=Fobsantilog[(Aex+Aem)/2](Eq. 1) where Fcorr and Fobs are the corrected and observed fluorescence intensities, respectively. Aex and Aem are the absorbance of the excitation and emission wavelength, respectively. The absorbance of the sample was measured using an Ultrospec 1100 Pro UV-visible absorption spectrophotometer. The normalized fluorescence difference (ΔF/ΔFmax) between the protein-protein and protein-RNA complex and the sum of the individual fluorescence spectra were used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd). A double reciprocal plot was used for determination of ΔFmax. The details of the data fitting are described elsewhere (38Firpo M.A. Connelly M.B. Goss D.J. Dahlberg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4693-4698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 39Khan M.A. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9092-9097Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensities were corrected when necessary for dilution and for the inner filter effect. Nonlinear least squares fitting of the data were performed using KaleidaGraph software (Version 2.1.3; Abelbeck Software).Competition reactions for VPg and TEV RNA binding to eIF4F and eIFiso4F were analyzed by fluorescence measurements at 25 °C in titration buffer. The competition reactions were performed at a constant eIF4F or eIFiso4F concentration (0.1 μm) and TEV (0.0, 0.1, and 0.5 μm) and increasing amounts of VPg.Stopped-flow Measurements—Stopped-flow kinetic measurements were performed on an OLIS RSM 1000 stopped-flow system with a 1-ms dead time. The excitation wavelength for eIF4F and eIFiso4F was 280 nm, and the cut-on filter was 324 nm. A reference photomultiplier was used to monitor fluctuations in the lamp intensity. The temperature of the flow cell and solution reservoirs was maintained using a temperature-controlled circulating water bath. VPg binding induced a decrease in eIF4F and eIFiso4F fluorescence. After rapid mixing of 0.5 μm (0.25 μm after mixing) eIF4F or eIFiso4F with 2 μm (1 μm after mixing) VPg, the time course of the fluorescence intensity change was recorded by computer data acquisition. In each experiment 1000 pairs of data were recorded, and sets of data from three experiments were averaged. Each averaged set of stopped-flow data were then fitted to nonlinear analytical equations using Global analysis software provided by OLIS. The data were fitted to the single- and double-exponential functions. Fitted curves correspond to the following single-exponential equation (40Olsen K. Christensen U. Sierks M.R. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9686-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), Ft=ΔFexp(-kobst)+F∞(Eq. 2) where Ft is the fluorescence observed at any time, t, the fluorescence when the reaction achieves equilibrium, F∞, is the final value of fluorescence, and kobs is the observed first-order rate constant. For double-exponential fits, the kinetic data were fit to the equation, Ft=ΔF1exp(-kobs1t)+ΔF2exp(-kobs2t)+F∞(Eq. 3) where Ft is the fluorescence observed at any time, t, the fluorescence when the reaction achieves equilibrium, F∞, is the final value of fluorescence, and kobs is the observed first-order rate constant. For double-exponential fits, the kinetic data were fit to the equation, where ΔF1 and ΔF2 are the amplitudes for the first and second components of two exponentials with rate constants kobs1 and kobs2, respectively. The residuals were measured by the differences between the calculated fit and the experimental data. The fitted rate constants were used to construct an Arrhenius plot according to the equation lnk=-EaRT+lnA(Eq. 4) where k is the rate constant, Ea is the activation energy, and A is the Arrhenius pre-exponential term. The activation energy was calculated from the slope of the fitted linear plot of ln k versus 1/T (kelvin).Dissociation Rate Constants—To measure the dissociation rate constants, a complex of eIF4F or eIFiso4F with VPg was rapidly diluted 15-fold in a spectrofluorimeter cuvette, and the resulting increase in fluorescence was measured. Because of the high binding affinity of the protein-protein complex, a large dilution, which could not be accomplished by stopped flow, was necessary. The concentrations of the reactants before mixing were 2 μm VPg and 0.5 μm eIF4F or eIFiso4F, respectively. The dissociation rates were determined from the fits of a single-exponential equation (Equation 2) to the data using the nonlinear least-square fitting program KaleidaGraph (Version 2.1.3, Abelbeck software). Equilibrium data indicate that at the end of the reaction for VPg·eIF4F and VPg·eIFiso4F, only 2 and 4%, respectively, of the complex remains. Essentially complete dissociation occurs under these conditions.RESULTSInteractions of eIFiso4E with Wild Type VPg and Truncated VPg71—To determine the specificity of VPg, VPg71, a truncated variant of wt VPg (N-terminal 1–70 amino acids) was used. Pulldown assays, as described for wt VPg (30Miyoshi H. Suehiro N. Tomoo K. Muto S. Takahashi T. Tsukamoto T. Ohmori T. Natsuaki T. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), were used (supplemental Fig. S1). Pulldown data showed that VPg71 did not compete with eIFiso4E for cap analog, and fluorescence titration data (See below) showed essentially no interaction of VPg71 with either eIF4E or eIFiso4E. These results are consistent with earlier work (41Leonard S. Plante D. Wittmann S. Daigneault N. Fortin M.G. Laliberte J.F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7730-7737Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) that showed a 1–61 deletion mutant did not compete with either eIF4E or eIFiso4E for cap binding. VPg71 was, therefore, used as a control for translation and binding assays.Effects of VPg on in Vitro Translation of RNA with Wheat Germ Extract—The 5′-leader of TEV RNA contains an IRES that promotes internal initiation and cap-independent translation (42Carrington J.C. Freed D.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1590-1597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Gallie D. Tanguay R. Leathers V. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition to the 5′-IRES, TEV contains a virus-encoded protein (VPg) covalently attached to the 5′ terminus that is cleaved after infection (44Dougherty W. Carrington J. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1988; 26: 123-143Crossref Google Scholar) but is still present in the cell (45Carrington J.C. Haldeman R. Dolja V.V. Restrepo-Hartwig M.A. J. Virol. 1993;"

Two polysialyltransferases, ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV, mediate polySia biosynthesis. To dissect the impact of each enzyme during postnatal brain development, we monitored the developmental changes in NCAM polysialylation in wild-type, ST8SiaII-, and ST8SiaIV-deficient mice using whole brain lysates obtained at 10 time points from postnatal days 1 to 21 and from adult mice. In wild-type and ST8SiaIV-null brain, polySia biosynthesis kept pace with the rapid increase in brain weight until day 9, and nearly all NCAM was polysialylated. Thereafter, polySia dropped by ∼70% within 1 week, accompanied by the first occurrence of polySia-free NCAM-140 and NCAM-180. In ST8SiaII-null brain, polySia declined immediately after birth, leading to 60% less polySia at day 9 combined with the untimely appearance of polySia-free NCAM. Polysialyltransferase deficiency did not alter NCAM expression level or isoform pattern. In all three genotypes, NCAM-140 and NCAM-180 were expressed at constant levels from days 1 to 21 and provided the major polySia acceptors. By contrast, NCAM-120 first appeared at day 5, followed by a strong up-regulation inverse to the decrease in polySia. Together, we provide a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the developmental changes in polySia level, NCAM polysialylation status, and polysialyltransferase transcript levels and show that the predominant role of ST8SiaII during postnatal brain development is restricted to the first 15 days.

At postnatal day 1 (P1), when under normal conditions the complete NCAM pool is polysialylated, a loss of ST8SiaII resulted in a decrease in polySia level by ∼40%.

This finding indicated striking differences in the impact of the two enzymes during postnatal brain development. It is well known that polySia decreases rapidly after birth (36Edelman G.M.

However, no information is available on the exact time course, changes in polysialyltransferase mRNA level, and the impact of the two polysialyltransferases on the developmental changes in NCAM polysialylation. In the present study, we have used biochemical analyses to quantitatively evaluate developmental changes in the polySia-NCAM pattern on a whole brain basis. PolySia level, NCAM isoform patterns, and the degree of NCAM polysialylation were studied on transcript, protein, and carbohydrate level in wild-type, ST8SiaII-/-, and ST8SiaIV-/- mice.

The proteins were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, loading 20 μg of total protein/lane. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to immunostaining using 2.5 μg/ml anti-polySia antibody 735 or anti-NCAM antibody H28 and enhanced chemiluminescence for detection. The intensity of protein bands was analyzed on appropriately exposed Lumi-Film chemiluminescenct detection films (Roche Applied Science) as mean gray value by computerized densitometric scanning and Kodak 1D 3.5 Network software (Kodak).

For normalization, primers specific for the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein were used (5′-CACTTCGTGCAAGAAATGCTG-3′ and 5′-AATCAACGCAGTTGTCCGTG-3′). For all primer pairs the amplification efficiencies were determined by analyzing the slope of a Ct/log(template concentration) plot (40Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25872) Google Scholar). DMB-HPLC Analysis—To analyze the total amount and the chain length pattern of polySia, the DMB-HPLC method (41Inoue S. Inoue Y. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 362: 543-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was used as described previously (35Galuska S.P. Oltmann-Norden I. Geyer H. Weinhold B. Kuchelmeister K.

Briefly, delipidated whole brain homogenates were dried, dissolved in 300 μl of DMB reaction buffer, and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with shaking. After removal of insoluble material, the reaction was stopped by adding 70 μl of 1 m NaOH to 280 μl of supernatant. Released polySia chains were separated by HPLC on a DNAPac PA-100 column (Dionex), and DMB-labeled polySia chains were detected with a fluorescent detector. MilliQ water, and 1 m NaNO3 (E2) were used as eluents at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution was performed by the following gradient: T0 min = 0% (v/v) E2; T5 min = 1% (v/v) E2; T15 min = 10% (v/v) E2; and T60 min = 50% (v/v) E2. The column was washed with 100% (v/v) E2 for 10 min. For quantification of the amount of individual polymer sizes, peak areas corresponding to the relative amount of each polySia chain with DP ≥8 were calculated. To determine the total amount of polySia, these peak areas were summarized. Quantitative Assessment of PolySia Level during Postnatal Brain Development of Wild-type, ST8SiaII-/-, and ST8SiaIV-/- Mice—To evaluate the impact of ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV on polySia biosynthesis during early postnatal brain development, a detailed quantitative analysis of polySia levels was performed in total brain homogenate of wild-type, ST8SiaII-/-, and ST8SiaIV-/- mice. For each genotype, brain samples were isolated at ten time points from P1 to P21 and from adult mice older than 6 month of age. Using delipidated whole brain homogenate, we determined the total amount of polySia by DMB-HPLC analysis as described previously (35Galuska S.P. Oltmann-Norden I. Geyer H. Weinhold B. Kuchelmeister K. Hildebrandt H. Gerardy-Schahn R. Geyer R. Mühlenhoff M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31605-31615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the results were displayed as relative polySia concentrations with the value obtained for P1 wild-type brain set to 100% (Fig. 1A). In the wild-type situation, the polySia level remained almost constant during the first postnatal week, and a significant down-regulation was not observed before P9. Notably, the dramatic developmental decrease, which was described in previous studies (36Edelman G.M. Chuong C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7036-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 37Rothbard J.B. Brackenbury R. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11064-11069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was found to occur in a narrow time window between P9 and P17. Within 8 days, the polySia level declined by almost 70% before a low but constant level was reached from P17 to P21. Toward adulthood, the amount of polySia further declined, and in brain isolated from mice older than 6 month of age, only 10% of the perinatal level was found. The comparison of polySia concentrations in the two knock-out animals impressively highlighted how the individual polysialyltransferase impacts polySia production. Whereas a lack of ST8SiaIV had no effect on the polySia level during the first 3 weeks, striking differences were observed in ST8SiaII-deficient brain. Starting on a 40% lower level on P1, polySia declined immediately after birth and remained rather constant from P9 to P21. Notably, the dramatic alterations observed in ST8SiaII-null mice were transient, being apparent from P1 to P15 but no longer visible at P17. From P17 to P19, almost identical polySia levels were found in all three genotypes, and 30% of the P1 wild-type level was reached. In adult brain, the relative polySia levels were 10, 5, and 2% in wild-type, ST8SiaII-/-, and ST8SiaIV-/- mice, respectively. Therefore, the loss of either enzyme resulted in decreased polySia level in adult brain. The reduction was, however, more prominent in the case of ST8SiaIV deficiency. To acknowledge the fact that early postnatal brain development is accompanied by a rapid increase in brain size, developmental changes in polySia level were also displayed per brain (Fig. 1B). In wild-type and ST8SiaIV-/- brain, the total amount of polySia increased 3-fold after birth, and peak expression was reached at P9. By clear contrast, no such peak expression was found in ST8SiaII-deficient brain, and the amount of polySia stayed remarkably constant from P5 to P21. To ensure that ST8SiaII deficiency did not affect brain growth, brain weights were determined and plotted over age (Fig. 1C). In particular during the first 15 days, when striking differences in polySia level were found between the two knock-out mice, a similar gain in brain weight was observed for all three genotypes. Thus, the selective reduction in polySia observed in ST8SiaII-deficent brain was not caused by growth retardation but is obviously due to a lower biosynthetic capacity. Analysis of the PolySia Chain Length Pattern during Postnatal Brain Development—To evaluate whether the developmental decrease in polySia level is paralleled by progressive shortening of polySia chains and whether the loss of either polysialyltransferase affects the chain length pattern, we analyzed the DP of polySia by DMB-HPLC analysis (41Inoue S. Inoue Y. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 362: 543-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 43Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Examples of representative chromatographic profiles obtained with brain samples from wild-type brain at different time points are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Each peak represents a polySia chain of defined DP, and determination of peak areas allows quantification of individual species resulting in a foot print of the chain length pattern. For each genotype, six time points were selected (P1, P5, P9, P13, P21, and adult), and the results were displayed in relation to the data obtained for wild-type brain at P1 and were set to 100% (Fig. 2). Importantly, long polySia chains were detected in all three genotypes and at all time points investigated, including adult brain. However, during development, the decrease in the amount of long chains was more pronounced than the reduction of short chains. In wild-type brain, this is most evident from P9 on. At P13 for example, polymers with DP 8–22 were uniformly decreased by 40%, whereas the abundance of longer chains declined increasingly with length leading to a 60% reduction of polymers with DP > 36. After P13, increased reduction with polymer length is visible over the whole DP range. These results demonstrate that during normal brain development, down-regulation of polySia is accompanied by alterations in the chain length profile. Comparison of the curves obtained for wild-type and ST8SiaII-/- brain (Fig. 2) revealed that loss of ST8SiaII had a dual effect on the polysialylation pattern. First, ST8SiaII deficiency resulted in an overall decrease in polySia level as indicated by a shift of the corresponding curves along the y axis. Second, an altered chain length distribution was observed as indicated by different curve slopes. The latter effect affected all polymer sizes and was restricted to time points before P9. In ST8SiaIV-/- mice, by contrast, deviations from the wild-type pattern were most prominent for long polymers, and the number of affected polymer sizes increased with age (reduction in polymers with DP > 36 at P1, DP > 28 at P9, and DP > 12 at P13). At P21, almost similar chain length patterns and total amounts of polySia were observed for all three genotypes. In summary, these results demonstrate that from P1 to P13 loss of either enzyme results in subtle but distinct alterations in the chain length pattern, although only ST8SiaII deficiency causes a severe reduction in the total amount of polySia. Developmental Changes in NCAM Polysialylation and NCAM Isoform Pattern in Wild-type, ST8SiaII-/-, and ST8SiaIV-/- Mice—Early postnatal brain development is characterized by a switch from polysialylated to nonpolysialylated NCAM (36Edelman G.M. Chuong C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7036-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 42Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To investigate whether polysialyltransferase deficiency affects the time course of this process, we performed a detailed Western blot analysis using whole brain homogenate from wild-type, ST8SiaII-/-, and ST8SiaIV-/- mice. The brains were isolated at subsequent days after birth (P1 to P21 and adult), and for each time point equal amounts of homogenate were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 3). Staining was performed either with mAb 735 (top panel) specific for α2,8-linked polySia with DP ≥ 8 (39Frosch M. Görgen I. Boulnois G.J. Timmis K.N. Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ghandour M.S. Deagostini-Bazin H. Goridis C. Brain Res. 1983; 265: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because each polySia chain provides multiple binding sites for an anti-polySia antibody, much stronger signals were obtained with mAb 735. However, staining with mAb H28 revealed a more detailed picture. This antibody binds preferentially the polySia-free form of NCAM and provides an ideal reagent to detect the appearance of nonpolysialylated NCAM in parallel to polySia-NCAM (Fig. 3, middle panel). Polysialylated NCAM of all isoforms migrates as a microheterogeneous band above 250 kDa, whereas focused bands at 120, 140, and 180 kDa indicate the expression of nonpolysialylated NCAM-120, -140, and -180, respectively. The analysis of wild-type brain revealed that polySia-free NCAM was barely discernible before P9, demonstrating that during the first postnatal week almost the complete brain NCAM pool is kept in the polysialylated form. After P9, the intensity of the polySia-NCAM signal decreased rapidly, paralleled by the appearance of nonpolysialylated NCAM of all three major isoforms. In ST8SiaIV-deficient brain, a very similar pattern was found, whereas the loss of ST8SiaII was accompanied by an untimely appearance of polySia-free NCAM. During the first postnatal days, when nonpolysialylated NCAM was not yet visible in wild-type and ST8SiaIV-/- brain, strong signals for polySia-free NCAM-140 and NCAM-180 were observed in ST8SiaII-deficient brain. To investigate whether these elevated levels of polySia-free NCAM were caused by an up-regulation of NCAM or a shift in the NCAM-isoform pattern, we analyzed NCAM expression in parallel brain samples that were pretreated with endosialidase to remove polySia (Fig. 3, bottom panel). In wild-type brain, NCAM-140 and NCAM-180 are the predominant isoforms during early postnatal development. Quantification of the corresponding bands revealed fairly constant expression levels during the first 3 weeks, whereas a decrease by almost 50% was observed toward adulthood (Fig. 4A).

Eight research papers in this issue present new results from the mission, covering the atmosphere, polar features, interactions with the solar wind and the controversial matter of venusian lightning. Håkan Svedham et al. open the section with a review of the similarities and (mostly) differences between Venus and its 'twin', the Earth. Andrew Ingersoll considers the latest results, and also how the project teams plan to make the most of the probe's remaining six years of life. Observations of infrared emission from CO2, O2 and NO established that photochemical and dynamic activity controls the structure of the upper atmosphere of Venus, but were unable to identify the altitude of the emission. But it is reported here that day-side CO2 emission extends from 90–120 km altitude, with a peak at ∼115 km. Night-side O2 emission peaks at 96 km and is visible over the range 95–100 km. The upper atmosphere of a planet is a transition region in which energy is transferred between the deeper atmosphere and outer space. Molecular emissions from the upper atmosphere (90–120 km altitude) of Venus can be used to investigate the energetics and to trace the circulation of this hitherto little-studied region. Previous spacecraft1 and ground-based2,3,4 observations of infrared emission from CO2, O2 and NO have established that photochemical and dynamic activity controls the structure of the upper atmosphere of Venus. These data, however, have left unresolved the precise altitude of the emission1 owing to a lack of data and of an adequate observing geometry5,6. Here we report measurements of day-side CO2 non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emission at 4.3 µm, extending from 90 to 120 km altitude, and of night-side O2 emission extending from 95 to 100 km. The CO2 emission peak occurs at ∼115 km and varies with solar zenith angle over a range of ∼10 km. This confirms previous modelling7, and permits the beginning of a systematic study of the variability of the emission. The O2 peak emission happens at 96 km ± 1 km, which is consistent with three-body recombination of oxygen atoms transported from the day side by a global thermospheric sub-solar to anti-solar circulation, as previously predicted8."
https://openalex.org/W2014417866,"Polyglutamylation is a post-translational modification that generates lateral acidic side chains on proteins by sequential addition of glutamate amino acids. This modification was first discovered on tubulins, and it is important for several microtubule functions. Besides tubulins, only the nucleosome assembly proteins NAP1 and NAP2 have been shown to be polyglutamylated. Here, using a proteomic approach, we identify a large number of putative substrates for polyglutamylation in HeLa cells. By analyzing a selection of these putative substrates, we show that several of them can serve as in vitro substrates for two of the recently discovered polyglutamylases, TTLL4 and TTLL5. We further show that TTLL4 is the main polyglutamylase enzyme present in HeLa cells and that new substrates of polyglutamylation are indeed modified by TTLL4 in a cellular context. No clear consensus polyglutamylation site could be defined from the primary sequence of the here-identified new substrates of polyglutamylation. However, we demonstrate that glutamate-rich stretches are important for a protein to become polyglutamylated. Most of the newly identified substrates of polyglutamylation are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins, including many chromatin-binding proteins. Our work reveals that polyglutamylation is a much more widespread post-translational modification than initially thought and thus that it might be a regulator of many cellular processes.

Our work reveals that polyglutamylation is a much more widespread post-translational modification than initially thought and thus that it might be a regulator of many cellular processes. One fundamental aspect of proteomic complexity comes from the various processing events that many proteins undergo following their synthesis. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation, are reversible monomodifications and are known to function as switches for the activity of many proteins. Polyglutamylation is a reversible polymodification generated by sequential covalent attachment of glutamic acids (up to 20 in some cases) to an internal glutamate residue of the target protein (1Edde B.

The role of NAP polyglutamylation has not yet been addressed, but as for tubulins, it may regulate the affinity of NAPs for their binding partners. Additional polyglutamylated proteins probably exist as the polyglutamylation-specific antibody GT335 (16Wolff A. de Nechaud B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyeres E. Audebert S. Edde B. Gros F.

Here, using a proteomic approach, we identify new substrates for polyglutamylation and show that they are modified by two polyglutamylases from the TTLL protein family. No clear “glutamylation motif” could be defined in their primary sequences, but all the here-identified new substrates contain glutamate-rich stretches that are most likely the acceptor sites for the modification. Our study opens the door to further investigations of the role of polyglutamylation as a general regulatory event of a broad range of cellular functions. Purification of GT335-reactive Proteins from HeLa Cells by Immunoaffinity Chromatography–10 mg of GT335 antibody was coupled to an N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Hi-Trap column (1 ml, GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HeLa cells were extracted in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, each at 10 μg/ml). The high speed supernatant (15 mg of protein) was loaded onto the column and after extensive washing with PBS, bound proteins were eluted with PBS containing 0.7 m NaCl and concentrated to 1 mg/ml on an Amicon ultrafiltration device (4 ml, cut-off 10 kDa, Millipore). Western Blotting–Proteins fused to EYFP were immunodetected with rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:5,000, Torrey Pines Biolabs) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) followed by detection with enhanced chemoluminescence (GE Healthcare). GT335 antibody was biotinylated with NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated simultaneously with horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (GE Healthcare). For producing polyclonal anti-TTLL4 and anti-TTLL5 antibodies, bacterially expressed and purified full-length mouse TTLL4 or fragment 692–1152 of mouse TTLL5 were injected into rabbits. Anti-TTLL antibodies were then purified from antisera against their respective targets. Mass Spectrometric Analysis–To identify the protein content of the GT335 affinity-purified fraction, the Coomassiestained protein bands were excised from the gel and submitted to in-gel trypsin digestion (17Fraering P.C. Ye W. Strub J.M. Dolios G. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. van Dorsselaer A. Wang R. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9774-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Peptides were then concentrated on a C18 pre-column, separated on a reversed-phase capillary column (Pepmap C18, 75-μm inner diameter, 15-cm length, LC Packings) and analyzed by MS/MS on a Q-Tof II mass spectrometer (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK). Data analysis was performed with Mascot (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) against the NCBI (The National Center for Biotechnology Information) Data base. Double- and triple-charged peptides were used for the research in data base, and the peptide tolerance was set to 0.2 Da for MS and to 0.3 Da for MS/MS. One missed cleavage by trypsin was accepted and carbamidomethylated cysteine and oxidized methionine were set as variable modifications. All entries were selected for the taxonomy. The Mascot score cut-off value for a positive protein hit was set to 50, and peptides with a score below 40 were manually interpreted to validate or discard the identification. Identified proteins were submitted to a second research including polyglutamylation as variable modification. Additions of 1–8 glutamic acids were considered and a new research has been done each time. In Vitro Polyglutamylation of the GT335 Affinity-purified Fraction–The GT335 affinity-purified fraction (final protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml) was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.5 mm ATP, 2.4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 60 μm l-[3H]glutamate (45–55 Ci/mmol, GE Healthcare). Following SDS-PAGE, gels were exposed to MP films (GE Healthcare) for 40 days at –80 °C after enhancement with Amplify (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitation Experiments–For the depletion of TTLLs, the GT335 affinity-purified fraction (10 μg of total protein) was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotary agitator with protein G magnetic beads (Dynabeads) that were coupled to anti-TTLL4 or anti-TTLL5 antibodies (2 μg). After washing with PBS, the TTLL-depleted fraction was polyglutamylated in vitro as described above. For immunoprecipitation of the EYFP fusions of NAPs and their chimeras, the high-speed supernatant of HeLa cell extracts was incubated under similar conditions with beads linked to anti-GFP antibody. Following extensive washing, the beads were directly resuspended in Laemmli buffer. In Vitro Polyglutamylation Assay with Recombinant Proteins–Putative substrates of polyglutamylation were cloned from mouse testis or brain cDNA libraries, expressed as polyhistidine tag fusion proteins in bacteria and purified by nickel affinity chromatography (except for EB1, which was a generous gift of S. Honnappa and M. O. Steinmetz). TTLL proteins were expressed as GST fusions in bacteria and purified on glutathione-Sepharose as previously described (4van Dijk J. Rogowski K. Miro J. Lacroix B. Edde B. Janke C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because only TTLL5 (CAM84325) was soluble and active when produced in bacteria as its full-length version, we produced truncated version of TTLL4 (TTLL4_C639, last 639 residues of CAM84324) and TTLL6 (TTLL6_N705, first 705 residues of CAM84326) and a shorter, naturally occurring version of TTLL7 (TTLL7S, CAM84327) (3Ikegami K.

Lacroix B. Edde B. Janke C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These shorter enzymes have been previously demonstrated to possess similar activities as compared with the full-length TTLLs (4van Dijk J. Rogowski K. Miro J. Lacroix B. Edde B. Janke C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The polyglutamylation assay was performed by incubating 1 μg of each purified TTLL enzyme with 4 μg of each putative substrate in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.5 mm ATP, 2.4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 7.4 μm l-[3H]glutamate (45–55 Ci/mmol, GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 30 °C. Alternatively, 4 μg of taxotere-stabilized MTs, prepared from adult mouse brains (18Regnard C. Desbruyeres E. Denoulet P. Edde B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4281-4289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used as a substrate. Quantification of the radioactivity incorporated into the different putative substrate proteins was done by scintillation counting of the protein bands after SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose. Each polyglutamylation test was performed at least three times in independent experiments. The overall count (dpm) varied between each set of experiments; however, the relative values of glutamate incorporated into different substrates tested with the same enzyme dilution were similar in all experiments. Each figure is one set of a given experiment performed at the same time with all substrates presented. Background levels (no incorporation) are below 100 dpm. In Vivo Polyglutamylation of the New Substrates–Putative substrates of polyglutamylation were cloned as EYFP fusion proteins in mammalian expression vectors and transfected into HeLa cells together with an active or an enzymatically inactive (mutation E901G in the ATP-binding site) version of TTLL4_C639-EYFP. After 24 h of transfection, cells were lysed in Laemmli buffer and subsequently analyzed by gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot. In Fig. 5C, NAPs and their chimeras were expressed alone and immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody prior to analysis. Mutagenesis–To exchange the C-terminal tails between the different NAPs, we introduced the restriction site BstBI into a highly conserved region of the NAPs. This was done by mutagenesis of NAPs (NAP1: T972C, NAP2: T951C, NAP4: T1170C T1171G T1172A, introducing a L391E amino acid change) using the QuikChange PCR method. The resulting mutants were expressed and were shown to behave like the wild-type proteins in the polyglutamylase assay (data not shown). We then used BstBI in combination with other enzymes to exchange the NAP domains. The resulting chimeras were cloned into bacterial and mammalian expression vectors. Purification and Identification of Putative Substrates for Polyglutamylation–Because the GT335 antibody detects protein bands besides those corresponding to the glutamylated forms of tubulins and NAPs on Western blots of HeLa cell extracts, it is likely that this antibody specifically recognizes some other polyglutamylated proteins. We therefore performed a large scale purification of GT335-reactive proteins from HeLa cell extracts by chromatography on a GT335 column. The affinity-purified fraction was submitted to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1, lane 1) or transferred onto nitrocellulose and probed with GT335 antibody (Fig. 1, lane 2). We visualized 40 protein bands on the gel after Coomassie staining, and about half of them were detected with GT335 antibody on Western blot. The remaining proteins might have been non-specifically retained on the column, for example by interacting with GT335-reactive proteins. However, it is also possible that some proteins are recognized by GT335 antibody only in their native form. We therefore excised all 40 protein bands from the gel and determined their protein content by nano-LC-MS/MS after trypsin digestion. This analysis gave rise to the identification of about 170 proteins (supplemental Table S1). To identify true substrates of polyglutamylation, the masses obtained by nano-LC-MS/MS were re-analyzed to search for masses that could be attributed to polyglutamylated tryptic peptides. However, we found no masses corresponding to modified peptides (mass increments of n times 129 Da, the mass of a glutamyl unit, with n ranging from 1 to 8). It has been previously reported that the polyglutamylated tryptic peptides of tubulins and NAPs are undetectable with the classical mass spectrometry method used here (1Edde B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.P. Desbruyeres E. Gros F. Denoulet P. Science. 1990; 247: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 7Regnard C. Desbruyeres E. Huet J.C. Beauvallet C. Pernollet J.C. Edde B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15969-15976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The same seems to be true for the other substrates of polyglutamylation. Actually, because of their high acidity and/or branched structure, the modified peptides are lost during the reverse phase chromatography used to fractionate the peptides (7Regnard C. Desbruyeres E. Huet J.C. Beauvallet C. Pernollet J.C. Edde B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15969-15976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An alternative procedure would be to fractionate the tryptic peptides by ion-exchange chromatography followed by a desalting step. This method has been used in the case of NAPs (7Regnard C. Desbruyeres E. Huet J.C. Beauvallet C. Pernollet J.C. Edde B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15969-15976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but to follow the modified peptides during the purification steps, radioactive glutamate had to be incorporated into the proteins. Another problem, because of the acidic character of the modified peptides, is that their ionization in electrospray or MALDI is very hard even in the negative mode. Several procedures have been proposed to solve this problem (19Juhasz P. Biemann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Kjellstrom S.

Sci. 2006; 12: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but the method remains far from straightforward. Taken together, we judged a mass spectrometry approach as not appropriate to identify new substrates of polyglutamylation. To preselect proteins with a high probability of being polyglutamylated, we took advantage of the fact that a polyglutamylase activity co-purifies with the GT335-reactive proteins (7Regnard C. Desbruyeres E. Huet J.C. Beauvallet C. Pernollet J.C. Edde B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15969-15976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Incubation of the GT335 affinity-purified fraction with [3H]glutamate and MgATP resulted in the radioactive labeling of 13 protein bands (Fig. 1, lane 3). Because the new substrates of polyglutamylation might, as tubulins and NAPs, be modified within a glutamate-rich sequence we searched for proteins containing such motifs among the proteins identified within the 13 3H-labeled bands. We found at least one protein with a glutamate-rich stretch in each of these bands (Table 1) and thus expect that these proteins are very likely targets of polyglutamylation.TABLE 1Preselection of very likely targets of polyglutamylationBandProteinAccessionMasspI1Nucleoporingi 8573683579935.865Proline-, glutamic acid-, leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1)gi 244153831195484.30Myb-binding protein 1Agi 711538251487629.3419α-Tubulingi 32015497614.9520Nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 4 (NAP2)gi 5174613427974.6021β-Tubulingi 18088719496404.7522Nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1 (NAP1)gi 4758756453464.3626NF45 proteingi 532313446698.2627Protein SETgi 46397790334694.2328PHAPIIgi 403009320844.1229B23 nucleophosmingi 825671309194.7132Acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family, member E (ANP32E)gi 13569879306743.7734Acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family, member A (ANP32A)gi 5453880285683.9935Acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family, member B (ANP32B)gi 1498227222634.19 Open table in a new tab TTLL4 and TTLL5 Modify New Substrates in Vitro–To confirm whether the very likely targets of polyglutamylation, preselected in Table 1, can indeed be polyglutamylated, a selection of them was produced in bacteria and purified for analysis in an in vitro polyglutamylation assay. Not all proteins were tested because some could not be produced in bacteria due to their large size (nucleoporin, PELP1, Myb-binding protein 1A) and others shared a high homology with some of the tested proteins (PHAPII is a shorter version of SET that differs only in few amino acids at the N terminus and ANP32E shares 57% identity with ANP32A (22Santa-Coloma T.A. Cerebellum. 2003; 2: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)). To test the ability of the selected proteins to be polyglutamylated in vitro, we need a source of polyglutamylase activity. Presently, the only known mammalian polyglutamylase enzymes are members of the TTLL protein family (4van Dijk J. Rogowski K. Miro J. Lacroix B. Edde B. Janke C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Following overexpression of the different TTLLs in HeLa cells, only TTLL4 and TTLL5 increased the GT335 reactivity of non-tubulin substrates (4van Dijk J. Rogowski K. Miro J. Lacroix B. Edde B. Janke C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, these two TTLLs are strong candidates for being the enzymes that polyglutamylate non-tubulin substrates. We therefore used recombinant TTLL4_C639 (a truncated version of TTLL4, see “Experimental Procedures”) and TTLL5 for in vitro polyglutamylation assays. To investigate the specificity of different enzymes for the new substrates, we also tested two other polyglutamylases, TTLL6_N705 and TTLL7S. The tested proteins, NAP1, NAP2, NF45, SET, B23, ANP32A, and ANP32B (Table 1, proteins in bold) are all strongly modified by TTLL4_C639 and to a lesser extent by TTLL5 (Fig. 2A). The two other enzymes, TTLL6_N705 and TTLL7S, which are both highly active on MTs, did not modify the new substrates (Fig. 2A). Thus, in vitro, non-tubulin substrates are specifically polyglutamylated by TTLL4 and TTLL5. Moreover, because all preselected proteins tested are modified, it is likely that the presence of glutamate-rich sequences is indeed, as proposed earlier, a signature of polyglutamylated proteins. Among the protein bands that were not labeled with [3H]glutamate by the polyglutamylase activity co-purified on the GT335 column, we identified several other proteins containing glutamate-rich stretches (supplemental Table S1, proteins in bold). These proteins might be polyglutamylated either to a lower extent or by a different enzyme, which was not co-purified on the GT335-column. To investigate this possibility, we repeated the in vitro polyglutamylation assays with the same set of TTLL enzymes on 6 of these proteins (GRP78, NASP, RANGAP, RNP-K, NCT, and EB1; Fig. 2B). As before, TTLL4_C639 was the most efficient enzyme. It incorporated [3H]glutamate into RNP-K and EB1, to a lesser extent into RANGAP and NCT, but poorly into GRP78 and NASP. Note that TTLL6_N705 and TTLL7S, which were inactive on the previously tested non-tubulin substrates, slightly modified EB1. This might be due to the close structural homology between EB1 and tubulins (23Honnappa S. John C.M. Kostrewa D. Winkler F.K. Steinmetz M.O. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Overall, the proteins modified in this test incorporated much less glutamate than the previously identified substrates, which might explain why they were not seen in the autoradiography (Fig. 1, lane 3). However, they have to be considered as potential substrates of polyglutamylation and their modification might be important in vivo. TTLL4 Is the Major Polyglutamylase Co-purified with the New Substrates–Because the GT335 affinity-purified fraction possesses a polyglutamylase activity able to modify the new substrates (Fig. 1, lane 3), we wanted to determine if it contains either TTLL4 or TTLL5, the two enzymes that modify the substrates in vitro. We therefore raised polyclonal antibodies against these TTLLs. The epitopes of both, anti-TTLL4 and anti-TTLL5 antibodies are located outside the domains that are conserved between the different TTLLs (supplemental Fig. S1). Accordingly, when we probed extracts of HeLa cells overexpressing the different full-length TTLL polyglutamylases, anti-TTLL4, and anti-TTLL5 antibodies specifically recognized their targets and exhibited no cross-reactivity with any other TTLL polyglutamylase (Fig. 3A). We then used these antibodies to probe the GT335-affinity purified fraction, but none of the antibodies detected a protein of the expected size on Western blot (not shown), most probably because of the absence or low concentration of the enzymes. Because both antibodies have been demonstrated to precipitate their target TTLL proteins (not shown), we used them to deplete the GT335 affinity-purified fraction. Following incubation of the depleted fractions with [3H]glutamate and MgATP, we observed a strong decrease of glutamate incorporation when TTLL4, but not when TTLL5 was depleted (Fig. 3B). Thus TTLL4 is the major enzyme involved in the polyglutamylation of the new substrates identified in HeLa cells. TTLL4 Polyglutamylates the New Substrates in HeLa Cells–To show that the proteins that are polyglutamylated in vitro can also be modified by TTLL4 under in vivo conditions, we expressed them as EYFP-tagged versions in HeLa cells. In untransfected cells (not shown) or cells overexpressing an inactive (ATPase-dead) TTLL4_C639 (Fig. 4, first lane), only proteins in the 50-kDa region (tubulins, NAPs) and a 180-kDa protein are detected with GT335 antibody. This indicates that the endogenous polyglutamylase activity of HeLa cells might be too low to modify most substrates above detection levels of GT335 in Western blot. Accordingly, in the absence of exogenous polyglutamylase activity, only substrates that were strongly modified in vitro (NAP1, NAP2, SET, and the ANP32 proteins) could be detected by GT335 antibody following their overexpression (Fig. 4, lower panel, “D”). We then expressed the selected proteins together with an active version of TTLL4_C639 (Fig. 4, “A”). A significant increase in GT335 reactivity was observed on a range of endogenous proteins (Fig. 4, compare first and second lane), demonstrating that GT335 specifically detects polyglutamylation on a large range of proteins. Moreover, the GT335 reactivity of NAP1, NAP2, SET, and the ANP32 proteins increased further, and other putative substrates (RANGAP and nucleolin) also became labeled with GT335 antibody (Fig. 4, lower panel, “A”). The expression levels of the substrates, as visualized with anti-GFP antibody, are similar in cells co-transfected with ATPase-dead or active TTLL4_C639 (Fig. 4, upper panel, “D” and “A”). Thus, increase of GT335 detection levels clearly correlates with increased polyglutamylation of the respective proteins by the active TTLL4_C639. Moreover, a shift in migration was observed for most of the modified proteins, suggesting that the charge and/or size of these proteins have been changed (Fig. 4, upper panel, compare “D” with “A” for the modified proteins). Requirements for Polyglutamylation–We identified a number of proteins that are subjected to polyglutamylation. All these proteins possess glutamate-rich stretches within their primary sequence, but no obvious polyglutamylation consensus site could be defined. To better understand the determinants of polyglutamylation, we analyzed the primary sequences of several members of the NAP family (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S2A) and their ability to be modified in vitro by TTLL4_C639 (Fig. 5B) or in HeLa cells by endogenous polyglutamylases (Fig. 5C). NAP1 and NAP2 are, in contrast to NAP3 and NAP4, strongly polyglutamylated in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 5). NAP1 was previously shown to possess a major polyglutamylation site in its C terminus and a minor site in its N terminus (7Regnard C. Desbruyeres E. Huet J.C. Beauvallet C. Pernollet J.C. Edde B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15969-15976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both sites consist of glutamate-rich stretches that are not well conserved among the members of the NAP family (supplemental Fig. S2A and Fig. 5A). NAP2 diverges from NAP1 in the N-terminal site. Because this is a minor polyglutamylation site, NAP2 is still strongly modified. On the contrary, the sequence of NAP4 diverges in the major C-terminal site and thus NAP4 is only lowly modified. NAP3 diverges in both sites and accordingly, it is not modified. Thus, we have shown a correlation between the presence of the two previously identified polyglutamylation sites and the extent of modification. In addition to these two sites, all NAPs possess a central domain which is rich in glutamates (supplemental Fig. S2A). This domain does not seem to be targeted by the polyglutamylation, as NAP3 is not modified although it has the most extended glutamate-rich central domain (Fig. 5A). The fact that this domain is not modified, although it is located at the outer surface of the protein according to the structure of NAP1 (24Park Y.J. Luger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1248-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggests that the presence of a glutamate-rich sequence is not the only prerequisite for its polyglutamylation. We then produced six chimeras of the NAP1, 2, and 4 proteins by swapping their C-terminal tails (Fig. 5A) and tested their ability to be modified by TTLL4_C639 in vitro (Fig. 5B) or by endogenous polyglutamylase activity in HeLa cells (Fig. 5C). Chimeras that possess the non-acidic C-terminal tail of NAP4 (NAP1_4 and NAP2_4), were poorly polyglutamylated both in vitro and in vivo, in good agreement with the lack of the major polyglutamylation site. On the other hand, chimeras that bear the highly acidic tail of NAP2 (NAP1_2 and NAP4_2) are, as NAP2, strongly modified. Concerning the chimeras that have the highly acidic tail of NAP1 (NAP2_1 and NAP4_1), NAP2_1 is modified to the same extent as NAP1 but NAP4_1 is less modified than one would expect according to the presence of the tail of NAP1. This again suggests that other, yet unknown determinants of polyglutamylation contribute to the modification. To further demonstrate that the presence of a glutamate-rich stretch is not the only prerequisite for a protein to become polyglutamylated, we analyzed different members of the nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin family. Nucleophosmin B23 has two putative acidic polyglutamylation sites (supplemental Fig. S2B). NPN2, an oocyte-specific homologue of B23, is more acidic in the first site but less in the second (supplemental Fig. S2B). Although, taken together, the total number of glutamate residues in the two potential polyglutamylation sites is similar, NPN2 is modified to a lower extent than nucleophosmin B23 by TTLL4_C639 (Fig. 6). This suggests that the second site contributes more to the degree of polyglutamylation than the first one. Consistently, NPN3, which completely lacks the second site, is poorly modified by TTLL4_C639 (Fig. 6). Again, these results reveal that not all glutamate-rich stretches present in proteins are equally subjected to polyglutamylation. We further analyzed the highly homologous proteins EB1 and EB3. Although both proteins carry a glutamate-rich C terminus (supplemental Fig. S2C), only EB1 was modified by TTLL4_C639 in vitro (Fig. 6). Other TTLL enzymes that are active on EB1 (Fig. 2B) were inactive on EB3 as well (not shown). Finally, we tested the protein HMG-B1, which has not been identified as a potential substrate, but has an extended glutamate-rich C terminus (supplemental Fig. S2D). HMG-B1 was almost not modified in the in vitro assay with TTLL4_ C639 (Fig. 6). Taken together, these observations show that the presence of glutamate-rich sequences can be a prerequisite, but is not sufficient by itself for a protein to become a target of polyglutamylation, suggesting that other features are required. Polyglutamylation was initially discovered on brain α-tubulin and subsequently also observed on β-tubulin (1Edde B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.P. Desbruyeres E. Gros F. Denoulet P. Science. 1990; 247: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 5Audebert S. Desbruyeres E. Gruszczynski C. Koulakoff A. Gros F. Denoulet P. Edde B. Mol. Biol.

It was considered as a tubulin-specific modification until it was demonstrated to target also NAP1 and NAP2 (7Regnard C. Desbruyeres E. Huet J.C. Beauvallet C. Pernollet J.C. Edde B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15969-15976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that polyglutamylation is an even more general post-translational modification. New Substrates for Polyglutamylation–Using the affinity of polyglutamylated proteins for the GT335 antibody, we purified many potential polyglutamylated proteins (supplemental Table S1). We demonstrated that several of these proteins are indeed subjected to polyglutamylation as they are modified by TTLL4 in vitro and/or in a cellular context. As we could not test all the putative substrates, a number of other targets of polyglutamylation might be present among the proteins listed insupplemental Table S1. Moreover, this list is by no means exhaustive as many of the substrates can be low abundance proteins. It is also possible that not all polyglutamylated proteins interact with the GT335 antibody. This antibody has been raised against a synthetic peptide (EGEGEEEG) modified by the addition of two glutamyl units on the third glutamate (16Wolff A. de Nechaud B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyeres E. Audebert S. Edde B. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 425-432PubMed Google Scholar) and it might, therefore, be biased toward proteins that are polyglutamylated within glutamate-rich sequences. Specificity of the Polyglutamylation Reaction–All the here-identified substrates of polyglutamylation are modified within glutamate-rich stretches, suggesting that an acidic environment at the acceptor site is generally necessary for polyglutamylation to occur. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that one cannot simply conclude that a protein possessing glutamate-rich sequences is subjected to polyglutamylation. Substrate recognition by polyglutamylases is probably a complex mechanism. Solving the crystal structure of the polyglutamylase enzymes and thus knowing the properties of the surface residues of the enzyme that are in contact with the substrate, will certainly facilitate understanding of the prerequisites for the polyglutamylation reaction. Taken together, we suggest that proteins with glutamate-rich sequences can be generally considered as potential substrates for polyglutamylation, although this needs to be tested for each single case. Possible New Roles of Polyglutamylation–Polyglutamylation generates acidic side chains of variable lengths on proteins. Such a modification might act as a fine-regulator of many cellular functions, for example by controlling the affinity of the here-identified target proteins for their binding partners, as earlier proposed for tubulins (reviewed in Ref. 25Verhey K.J. Gaertig J. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2152-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Many of the new substrates of polyglutamylation (ANP32 proteins, SET, nucleophosmin B23, nucleolin, and RNP-K), as well as the NAP proteins, shuttle between the cytosol and the nucleus (22Santa-Coloma T.A. Cerebellum. 2003; 2: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Borer R.A. Lehner C.F. Eppenberger H.M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 27Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Because nucleoporin and RANGAP, proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, are also modified, polyglutamylation could play an important regulatory role in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Moreover, most of these shuttling proteins are histone chaperones (NAP1, NAP2, B23, SET/PHAPII, nucleolin) and/or regulators of transcription (ANP32 proteins, SET/PHAPII, NF45, PELP1, RNP-K), suggesting that polyglutamylation might also regulate access to chromatin. Finally, EB1 and RANGAP are regulators of MT dynamics, suggesting that not only the polyglutamylation of tubulin, but also of its associated proteins could be important for the dynamics and functions of MTs. In cycling cells, the maximum yield of tubulin polyglutamylation is achieved during mitosis (18Regnard C. Desbruyeres E. Denoulet P. Edde B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4281-4289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus tempting to speculate that, by targeting simultaneously MTs and chromatin-binding proteins, polyglutamylation allows for a cross-talk between spindle dynamics and changes in chromatin structure accompanying mitosis.

To elucidate the mechanism of their action, we determined the kinetics of individual steps of the ribosome binding/release cycle of bacterial trigger factor (TF), using fluorescently labeled chaperone and ribosome-nascent chain complexes. Both the association and dissociation rates of TF-ribosome complexes are modulated by nascent chains, whereby their length, sequence, and folding status are influencing parameters. However, the effect of the folding status is modest, indicating that TF can bind small globular domains and accommodate them within its substrate binding cavity. In general, the presence of a nascent chain causes an up to 9-fold increase in the rate of TF association, which provides a kinetic explanation for the observed ability of TF to efficiently compete with other cytosolic chaperones for binding to nascent chains. Furthermore, a subset of longer nascent polypeptides promotes the stabilization of TF-ribosome complexes, which increases the half-life of these complexes from 15 to 50 s. Nascent chains thus regulate their folding environment generated by ribosome-associated chaperones. In all organisms ribosome-associated chaperones assist early steps of protein folding.

To promote the folding of cytosolic proteins to the native state, cells employ a large arsenal of chaperones, some of which transiently associate with ribosomes. These specialized chaperones are optimally positioned to interact co-translationally with the emerging nascent polypeptides, which allows them to assist early folding steps during ongoing synthesis thereby providing a link between translation and protein folding (1Young J.C.

This initial step of the TF functional cycle is essential for its in vivo activity in chaperoning nascent polypeptides (13Kramer G. Rauch T. Rist W. Vorderwülbecke S. Patzelt H. Schulze-Specking A.

The affinity of TF for vacant ribosomes is rather low with a dissociation constant on the order of 1 μm (14Maier R. Eckert B. Scholz C. Lilie H. Schmid F.X. J. Mol.

However, the presence of a nascent polypeptide results in an up to 10-fold increase in affinity of TF for ribosomes (17Raine A. Lovmar M. Wikberg J. Ehrenberg M. J. Biol.

The half-life of TF complexes with vacant ribosomes is ∼11 s and does not seem to be affected by the ongoing translation (11Kaiser C.M. Chang H.C. Agashe V.R. Lakshmipathy S.K. Etchells S.A.

After dissociation from the ribosome, TF has the ability to stay associated with the growing polypeptide for a few more seconds depending on the hydrophobicity of the nascent chain. However, the detailed kinetics of TF-ribosome interactions and the parameters of the nascent chains that make the critical contributions to these interactions remain unknown. To elucidate the mechanism of these early steps of chaperone-assisted folding of newly synthesized proteins, we investigated whether the properties of the nascent polypeptide chains, such as length, amino acid composition, and folding status affect the dynamics of TF binding to the ribosome. For this purpose, we developed a method to isolate quantitative amounts of homogeneous populations of ribosome-nascent chain (RNC) complexes, and we determined the association and dissociation rates of TF binding to these ribosomes. Our analysis revealed that the nature of nascent polypeptides significantly affects the association and dissociation rates of the TF-ribosome complex. Therefore, nascent chains control the functional cycle of chaperone machinery that assists the early steps of protein folding. Design of Arrested Nascent Chain Constructs–See supplemental material for details. Purification of Ribosomes and RNCs–Ribosomes were purified from strain MC4100 Δtig as described (18Hoffmann A. Merz F. Rutkowska A. Zachmann-Brand B. Deuerling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6539-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). RNCs used for kinetics measurements were purified from E. coli strain BL21(DE3) Δtig, which contained one of the arrested nascent chain plasmids (pBAT-Strep3-SecM) and the pZA4 plasmid. Strains were grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.6–0.8 in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml spectinomycin. The culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown as before for an additional 60 min. Afterward the cells were cooled on ice, harvested by centrifugation, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cell pellets from 1 liter of LB medium were thawed on ice and resuspended in 10 ml of cold Buffer I (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KOAc, 12 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After cell lysis by French press, cell debris was removed by centrifugation (16,000 rpm, 4 °C, 2 times for 30 min). Cleared extract was adjusted to a final concentration of 1 m KOAc and 12 mm Mg(OAc)2 in a final volume of 15 ml and loaded onto a 45-ml high salt sucrose cushion (25% w/v sucrose, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 m KOAc, 12 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Bulk ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation (44,000 rpm, 4 h, 4 °C) in a Ti45 rotor (Beckman) and resuspended overnight on ice in Buffer I supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Resuspended ribosomes were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 1.5 ml of 50% StrepTactin® suspension (IBA GmbH) previously equilibrated with Buffer I. Afterward, the StrepTactin® resin was washed with 10 ml of Buffer I supplemented with ATP (end concentration 5 mm) and with 10 ml of Buffer I without ATP. RNCs were then eluted with Buffer I containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (6 times, 380-μl fractions), and the concentration of RNCs was determined by measuring the absorption at 260 nm. RNCs containing fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For pulldown experiments, RNCs were purified from wild type BL21(DE3) strain as above omitting the ATP wash step. Elution fractions were pooled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Purification of TF Variants–The plasmids coding for the TF-R14C and TF-FRK/AAA-R14C were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pDS56-TF and pDS56-TF-FRK/AAA, respectively. For site-specific labeling, 6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethyl-aminonaphthalene (BADAN, Molecular Probes) was used. See supplemental material for protein purification and labeling method. Kinetic Measurements between BADAN-R14C-TF and Ribosome/RNC–All kinetic measurements were performed in Buffer F (10 mm MgCl2, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with all components pre-equilibrated to 20 °C by following the change in fluorescence at 507 nm with an excitation wavelength of 398 nm (7 or 7.5 nm bandwidth) in an LS55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Association reactions were initiated by adding the ribosome or RNC-containing solution to the labeled TF variant in the fluorimeter cuvette with short manual mixing. The measurements for the TF·RNC complex formation were performed according to pseudo first-order conditions, with constant RNC concentrations (50 nm, for RNC-3-Strep also 100 nm) and titration of BADAN-R14C-TF (from 150 to 800 nm). On average for one experimental set-up, 12 association reactions were measured with eight different TF concentrations. The traces were analyzed as single exponential functions by using the program GraFit 5.0.12. The second-order association rate constant was determined by linear regression analysis of the replotted observed rates versus the BADAN-R14C-TF concentration. The reported values are average ± S.E. of at least four independent titrations. The measurements for the association of TF to vacant ribosomes were performed with constant ribosome concentrations (varying between experiments from around 250 to 650 nm) and titration of BADAN-R14C-TF around the given ribosome concentration (i.e. for 380 nm ribosomes, 300, 350, 400, and 450 nm TF). The second-order association rate constant was obtained by performing a global fit of the general solution (Equation 1) of the differential equation of the association reaction to each set of traces with constant ribosome concentration and different TF concentrations using nonlinear regression analysis and the GraphPad Prism 4.0 program (GraphPad Software, San Diego). The reported values are averages ± S.E. of at least five independent titrations weighted with their individual standard errors. F=F0+(Fmax-F0)×-2k1[A](1-e-tΔ)(k1[A]+k1[B]+k2)(1-e-tΔ)+Δ(1+e-tΔ)(Eq. 1) where k1 indicates second-order association rate constant; k2 indicates dissociation rate constant; [A] and [B] indicate concentrations of BADAN-R14C-TF and vacant ribosomes, respectively, with [A] ≥ [B]; Δ = (k1[A] + k1[B] + k2)2 - 4k12[A][B]. To determine the dissociation rate constants, a 10-fold excess of unlabeled TF was added to a preformed complex of BADAN-R14C-TF and ribosomes or BADAN-R14C-TF and RNC, and the fluorescence change was recorded as described above. A single exponential function was fitted to the data using the program GraFit 5.0.12 or GraphPad Prism 4.0. For each construct the reported values are average ± S.E of at least 10 independent displacement reactions weighted with their individual standard errors. The half-life was calculated using average dissociation rate constant. The apparent dissociation equilibrium constants were calculated as the ratio between the apparent dissociation and association rate constants. In control experiments, the BADAN-R14C-TF-AAA mutant deficient in ribosome binding was used instead of BADAN-R14C-TF. Design and Purification of Stalled RNC Complexes–To determine the individual parameters of nascent polypeptides that may affect the binding of TF to ribosome, it is essential to investigate RNCs harboring defined states of nascent chains, and hence to arrest the translation process at selected stages. For this purpose, we improved a method that allows the stalling of nascent chains in E. coli cells followed by the isolation of quantitative amounts of stalled RNCs (19Evans M.S. Ugrinov K.G. Frese M.A. Clark P.L. Nat. Meth. 2005; 2: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Schaffitzel C. Ban N. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 158: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To induce translational arrest, we genetically fused the 3′-end of the open reading frames of target genes to a linker encoding both the SecM peptide, which induces translational arrest (21Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), and additional amino acids (aa) to allow the complete exposure of the target protein at the ribosomal exit site (Fig. 1A) (18Hoffmann A. Merz F. Rutkowska A. Zachmann-Brand B. Deuerling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6539-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In order to affinity purify the stalled RNCs, we introduced a triple strep tag sequence at the 5′-end of the gene construct (20Schaffitzel C. Ban N. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 158: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These fusion proteins were expressed in Δtig mutant cells lacking TF resulting in the production of stalled RNCs. The isolated RNCs fractions were highly pure (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1), devoid of vacant ribosomes, and mainly represented monosomes that carry the nascent polypeptide of the expected size (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1). All purified samples were examined by immunoblotting for the presence of chaperones (GroEL, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE) or other ribosome-associated factors (signal recognition particle). Only in a few samples two chaperones (GroEL and DnaJ) could be detected in very small amounts (<1% compared with nascent chains) (supplemental Fig. 1C). In order to investigate the kinetics of TF interaction with RNCs, we produced a set of different nascent polypeptides designed to probe both the effects of chain length and folding state. Nascent chains of various lengths were derived from two natural TF substrates, isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH, 416 aa) and RNA polymerase subunit β (RpoB, 1342 aa) (22Deuerling E. Patzelt H. Vorderwülbecke S. Rauch T. Kramer G. Schaffitzel E. Mogk A. Schulze-Specking A. Langen H. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1317-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We generated RNCs exposing, in addition to the triple strep tag, either the N-terminal 27, 66, 108, 177, or 318 aa of ICDH (ICDH-27 to ICDH-318) or the N-terminal 23, 36, 100, 148, 190, 233, 325, or 516 aa of RpoB (RpoB-23 to RpoB-516). None of the ICDH derived nascent chains should be capable of adopting a compactly folded structure as judged from its atomic structure (23Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingam V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and the finding that several truncated ICDH nascent chains are highly protease-sensitive (18Hoffmann A. Merz F. Rutkowska A. Zachmann-Brand B. Deuerling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6539-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For RpoB, the structural features of two homologs (24Campbell E.A. Pavlova O. Zenkin N. Leon F. Irschik H. Jansen R. Severinov K. Darst S.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) suggest that RpoB-148 may fold into the first N-terminal RpoB domain and RpoB-516 encompasses the first two domains of RpoB. This conclusion is supported by proteinase K digest experiments of purified RNCs revealing an enhanced stability for RpoB-148 compared with RpoB-100 (Fig. 4B). Finally, the SecM peptide used for arresting nascent chains at the ribosome is short and remains buried in the ribosomal tunnel. Therefore, the likelihood that the SecM peptide affects the folding of the exposed nascent chain is highly unlikely. Indeed, in biochemical and structural studies (see Ref.19Evans M.S. Ugrinov K.G. Frese M.A. Clark P.L. Nat. Meth. 2005; 2: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and data not shown), no major influence of the SecM peptide on the folding of arrested nascent chains was noticed. In addition, since all our nascent chains were constructed in the same way, potential influences of the SecM peptide and the strep tag should not interfere with the relative differences between the kinetic values. Nascent Polypeptides Accelerate TF Association with Ribosomes–The association and dissociation kinetics of TF interactions with ribosomes and RNCs were measured using fluorescence spectroscopy. The TF variant TF-R14C was fluorescently labeled with BADAN at position Cys-14, which allowed us to monitor the ribosome binding of TF by detection of a decrease in fluorescence emission (11Kaiser C.M. Chang H.C. Agashe V.R. Lakshmipathy S.K. Etchells S.A. Hayer-Hartl M. Hartl F.U. Barral J.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Maier R. Eckert B. Scholz C. Lilie H. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The addition of 0.35 μm BADAN-labeled TF (F-TF) to 0.5 μm vacant ribosomes led to a significant decrease in fluorescence emission (Fig. 2, A and B). However, no change in fluorescence was observed when the ribosome concentration was decreased to 0.05 μm. In contrast, addition of 0.05 μm RNCs carrying either ICDH-108 or RpoB-100 to 0.35 μm F-TF was sufficient to generate a strong decrease in fluorescence emission (the emission maximum remained unchanged, ∼507 nm). The observed fluorescence changes specifically monitored the association of TF with vacant ribosomes and RNCs, because addition of a fluorescence-labeled TF mutant protein, F-TF-AAA, which is deficient in ribosome binding (13Kramer G. Rauch T. Rist W. Vorderwülbecke S. Patzelt H. Schulze-Specking A. Ban N. Deuerling E. Bukau B. Nature. 2002; 419: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), to vacant ribosomes or RNCs did not result in any fluorescence change (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, in the absence of ribosomes, the addition of a short peptide as well as folded proteins (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and dihydrofolate reductase) at 3 μm concentrations had no effect on the F-TF fluorescence (data not shown). All labeled TF proteins used in our experiments were functionally similar to unlabeled wt-TF as judged from chaperone assays with denatured glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (data not shown), which is in agreement with earlier characterizations of F-TF (11Kaiser C.M. Chang H.C. Agashe V.R. Lakshmipathy S.K. Etchells S.A. Hayer-Hartl M. Hartl F.U. Barral J.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Maier R. Eckert B. Scholz C. Lilie H. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In order to determine the rates of TF association with vacant ribosomes and RNCs, we varied F-TF concentrations from 150 to 700 nm, while keeping the concentrations of ribosomes (0.5 μm) or RNCs (0.05 μm) constant. The observed association rates, obtained from such a F-TF titration experiment, increases as a function of increasing concentrations of F-TF, and all kinetics are best described by mono-exponential functions (Fig. 2C). The determined second-order association rate constants are highly reliable as demonstrated by linear regression analysis of the replotted observed rates versus the F-TF concentration, resulting in an excellent fit of the data points to a linear correlation (examples given in Fig. 2D). The association rate (kon) of TF interaction with vacant ribosomes was 21 × 103 m-1 s-1. However, the presence of a nascent chain increased this association rate of F-TF in case of all tested polypeptides (supplemental Table 1). To test for any contribution of the N-terminal strep tag, we determined the association rate of F-TF to RNCs exposing only the tag sequence (RNC-3-Strep). This tag increased the association rate of the chaperone by 2.4-fold compared with vacant ribosomes (Fig. 3). The Length of Nascent Polypeptides Affects TF Association with Ribosomes–We next examined the influence of nascent chain length on the association rates of F-TF to ribosomes. For RNCs exposing ICDH chains, the rates gradually increased with increasing chain length up to 8.6-fold above vacant ribosomes for the ICDH-108 construct. For RNCs exposing even longer chains of ICDH (ICDH-177 and ICDH-318), the association rates decreased again to 5.2- and 4-fold above empty ribosomes, respectively (Fig. 3 andsupplemental Table 1). In the case of RNCs exposing RpoB chains, the association rate increased more than 7-fold upon exposure of only 36 N-terminal aa of RpoB (RpoB-36) and gradually decreased for RpoB-190 to RpoB-516 down to 2.5-fold in comparison to vacant ribosomes (Fig. 3 andsupplemental Table 1). Notably, the association rate of F-TF with the RpoB-148 nascent chain, which may be capable of folding into a stable subdomain, was lower than the next shorter and longer polypeptides, RpoB-100 and RpoB-190, respectively. Nascent chains of two other model TF substrates, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (MetK) and firefly luciferase, caused comparably strong effects on the association rate of TF with ribosomes (Fig. 3 andsupplemental Table 1). In summary, the interaction of F-TF with the tested sets of RNCs showed the same tendency as follows: a chain length-dependent increase in the association rate, up to almost 9-fold, followed by a decrease for RNCs exposing very long chains (approximately >200 exposed aa). An increase in chain length generally goes along with an increase in the number of hydrophobic patches that define TF-binding sites as determined by peptide array analysis of several protein sequences, including ICDH (22Deuerling E. Patzelt H. Vorderwülbecke S. Rauch T. Kramer G. Schaffitzel E. Mogk A. Schulze-Specking A. Langen H. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1317-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Patzelt H. Rudiger S. Brehmer D. Kramer G. Vorderwulbecke S. Schaffitzel E. Waitz A. Hesterkamp T. Dong L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14244-14249Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The occurrence and composition of such hydrophobic stretches are likely to be the major determinants for stimulating TF binding to RNCs (Fig. 3B). This is evident for RpoB-36, harboring an extended contiguous hydrophobic stretch of 13 aa, in comparison with a slightly short nascent chains of RpoB (RpoB-23, Fig. 3) in which this stretch is absent. These chains differ only by a few amino acids in length, but they display different kon of approximately 163,000 and 95,000 m-1s-1, respectively. The subsequent decrease of the association rates for the RNCs exposing long ICDH and RpoB nascent chains (Fig. 3) most likely reflects the increased capacity of the nascent chains to attain some secondary and tertiary structure, resulting in the burying of TF-binding sites. Folding States of Nascent Polypeptides Influence TF Association with Ribosomes–The observed decrease in the association rates for longer chains or partially folded domains (RpoB-148) suggested that the folding state of a nascent polypeptide may influence TF binding to ribosomes. To test this directly, we investigated two additional pairs of RNCs, each of which contains nascent chains of similar length and sequence but different folding state. The first set consisted of folded α-spectrin SH3-wt domain (62 aa) and a mutant derivative, SH3-m10, that can only adopt a random coil structure due to two point mutations (27Blanco F.J. Angrand I. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SH3-m10 remains protease-sensitive when exposed as arrested polypeptide on the surface of ribosomes (18Hoffmann A. Merz F. Rutkowska A. Zachmann-Brand B. Deuerling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6539-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The second set consists of a full-length Barnase mutant (110 aa), which is deficient in RNase activity but can properly fold (28Mossakowska D.E. Nyberg K. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3843-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and a truncated Barnase variant (Barnase-95, 95 aa), which lacks its C-terminal 15 aa. We found that while ribosome-tethered Barnase can adopt a fold that confers protease resistance, Barnase-95 remains protease-sensitive suggesting that it is incapable of adopting any significant native-like structure (Fig. 4A), which is consistent with earlier results of in vitro folding studies (29Neira J.L. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1309-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the two SH3-wt and SH3-m10 nascent chains are identical in length and differ by only two amino acids, they exhibited differences in the TF association rates. The kon for TF binding to RNCs carrying unfolded SH3-m10 was 1.6-fold higher than RNCs carrying folded SH3-wt (Fig. 5 andsupplemental Table 1). We observed very similar results for Barnase and Barnase-95 RNCs. These data support the hypothesis that folding of the nascent chain retards TF binding to ribosomes. Nevertheless, folded Barnase and SH3-wt nascent chains showed enhanced TF association rates compared with vacant ribosomes, suggesting that TF can accommodate and has significant affinity for globular domains of small size. The stimulation of TF binding to these substrates may result from the presence of hydrophobic patches that are exposed on the surface of the native folds (30Musacchio A. Noble M. Pauptit R. Wierenga R. Saraste M. Nature. 1992; 359: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 31Mauguen Y. Hartley R.W. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Bricogne G. Chothia C. Jack A.

https://openalex.org/W1984317290,"In response to genotoxic stress, cells evoke a plethora of physiological responses collectively aimed at enhancing viability and maintaining the integrity of the genome. Here, we report that unspliced tRNA rapidly accumulates in the nuclei of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae after DNA damage. This response requires an intact MEC1- and RAD53-dependent signaling pathway that impedes the nuclear export of intron-containing tRNA via differential relocalization of the karyopherin Los1 to the cytoplasm. The accumulation of unspliced tRNA in the nucleus signals the activation of Gcn4 transcription factor, which, in turn, contributes to cell-cycle arrest in G1 in part by delaying accumulation of the cyclin Cln2. The regulated nucleocytoplasmic tRNA trafficking thus constitutes an integral physiological adaptation to DNA damage. These data further illustrate how signal-mediated crosstalk between distinct functional modules, namely, tRNA nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, protein synthesis, and checkpoint execution, allows for functional coupling of tRNA biogenesis and cell-cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2061607991,"TATA-box-binding protein (TBP)-related factor 3, TRF3 (also called TBP2), is a vertebrate-specific member of the TBP family that has a conserved carboxy-terminal region and DNA-binding domain virtually identical to that of TBP (ref. 1). TRF3 is highly expressed during embryonic development, and studies in zebrafish and Xenopus have shown that it is required for normal embryogenesis. Here we show that zebrafish embryos depleted of Trf3 exhibit multiple developmental defects and, in particular, fail to undergo haematopoiesis. Expression profiling for Trf3-dependent genes identified mespa, which encodes a transcription factor whose murine orthologue is required for mesoderm specification, and chromatin immunoprecipitation verified that Trf3 binds to the mespa promoter. Depletion of Mespa resulted in developmental and haematopoietic defects markedly similar to those induced by Trf3 depletion. Injection of mespa messenger RNA (mRNA) restored normal development to a Trf3-depleted embryo, indicating mespa is the single Trf3 target gene required for zebrafish embryogenesis. Zebrafish embryos depleted of Trf3 or Mespa also failed to express cdx4, a caudal-related gene required for haematopoiesis. Mespa binds to the cdx4 promoter, and epistasis analysis revealed an ordered trf3-mespa-cdx4 pathway. Thus, in zebrafish, commitment of mesoderm to the haematopoietic lineage occurs through a transcription factor pathway initiated by a TBP-related factor."

Phages TP901-1 and Tuc2009 share ∼78-97% amino acid identity in the individual protein components that make up their baseplate, which is formed by 5 and 6 proteins, respectively (Table 1): the tape measure protein (TMP), the distal tail protein (Dit), the tail-associated lysozyme (Tal), the upper baseplate protein (BppU), and the lower baseplate protein, which acts as the RBP (BppL). An additional protein is present in the base plate of Tuc2009, which was designated the baseplate-associated protein (BppA). TMPs are generally the longest ORF products observed in bacteriophages. According to secondary structure predictions, these proteins exist as a long continuous helix, with the exception of a small C-terminal section that contains both α-helices and β-strands. It has been shown that TMP length governs the size of the tail of the phage (11Pedersen M. Ostergaard S. Bresciani J. Vogensen F.K.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The Tal protein is composed of two domains, which can be released by self-cleavage at a consensus site (13Kenny J.G. Mc Grath S. Fitzgerald G.F. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3480-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is believed to participate in the assembly of the baseplate structure, whereas the C-terminal domain represents a peptidoglycanase activity. In contrast, little is known about Dit, besides its suggested role in orchestrating the formation of the initiator complex (IC) of the baseplate structure (7Mc Grath S. Neve H. Seegers J.F.

Together with TMP and Tal, Dit is thought to form the IC, the core of the baseplate, on which BppU and BppL, the latter being the antireceptor, are plugged (5Vegge C.S. Vogensen F.K. Mc Grath S.

Vogensen F.K. Mc Grath S. Neve H. van Sinderen D. Brondsted L. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Vegge C.S. Brondsted L. Neve H. Mc Grath S. van Sinderen D. Vogensen F.K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4187-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore BppU and BppL should be expected to interact directly. BppL is the RBP that specifically recognizes the host, as demonstrated by experiments in which BppL from TP901-1 was swapped with that of Tuc2009, resulting in host specificity exchange (11Pedersen M. Ostergaard S. Bresciani J. Vogensen F.K. Virology. 2000; 276: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As revealed by the x-ray structure of the trimeric molecule, the ∼30 first residues at the N terminus (the shoulders) of BppL form a 3 α-helix bundle followed by an interlaced β-prism domain (the neck) (8Spinelli S. Campanacci V. Blangy S. Moineau S. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14256-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These N-terminal domains share ∼64% sequence identity between both phages. The helix bundle (the shoulders) form the domain probably involved in the interaction with BppU, and the sequence similarity observed between this domain in both phages explains why the swapping experiment was successful. The N-terminal domain is followed by the head domain, which recognizes the host's receptor. In TP901-1, as well as in the p2 or bIL170 phages, it is a trimeric arrangement of double Greek key domains (8Spinelli S. Campanacci V. Blangy S. Moineau S. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14256-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Spinelli S. Desmyter A. Verrips C.T. de Haard H.J. Moineau S. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Virol. 2006; 80: 9331-9335Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the head domains of TP901-1 and Tuc2009 share no sequence identity at all, and therefore, the three-dimensional structure of the Tuc2009 head domain remains elusive. Secondary structure predictions are compatible with the Tuc2009 RBP head also being a double Greek key domain. Finally, BppA from Tuc2009 has no counterpart in the TP901-1 baseplate. It has been proposed to be a partner of BppU and/or BppL as an “accessory” protein (7Mc Grath S. Neve H. Seegers J.F. Eijlander R. Vegge C.S. Brondsted L. Heller K.J. Fitzgerald G.F. Vogensen F.K. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3972-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently, the tail tip of the bacteriophage SPP1, a siphoviridae infecting Bacillus subtilis, has been described in a cryo-EM study (12Plisson C. White H.E. Auzat I. Zafarani A. Sao-Jose C. Lhuillier S. Tavares P. Orlova E.V. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This study reveals the arrangement of the TMP, Dit, and Tal proteins, aligned in this order. Interestingly, the last 260 residues of TMP forming the cap, Dit, and the Tal-N terminus share significant identity (20-30%) with the corresponding proteins in Tuc2009 or TP901-1 (12Plisson C. White H.E. Auzat I. Zafarani A. Sao-Jose C. Lhuillier S. Tavares P. Orlova E.V. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The tail-tip structure of SPP1 therefore provides interesting resemblances to the proposed initiation complex of Tuc2009 and TP901-1. In this study, all proteins of the Tuc2009 tail and baseplate (except TMP) were expressed and purified. Determining the molecular weights of proteins or their complexes can be achieved by using different techniques such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC), native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, light scattering, and analytical centrifugation. Among these, SEC is a simple, fast and non-destructive method for estimating the molecular weight of a protein in its native form, based on a calibration curve obtained with protein standards. However, the elution position depends not only on the molecular weight but also on the shape of the protein, and on its tendency to interact with the column matrix. To overcome these limitations, SEC can be used in combination with on-line multiangle laser light scattering and refractrometry. The molecular weight from this measurement is then independent of the elution order, permitting determination of the molecular weight of simple proteins, protein complexes, and their stoichiometry. The on-line SEC-MALS/UV/RI used in this study is a system provided by Wyatt Technology (Santa Barbara, CA). It consists of a combination of three detectors placed in series after an SEC column: a static light scattering detector (SLS), a dynamic light scattering detector, and a refractometry detector. On top of this, multiwavelength on-line UV-visible absorbance is provided by the HPLC system. SLS measures the intensity of the scattered light as a function of angle. SLS measurements can yield the molar mass and root mean squared radius (Rg). Light scattering detector measures the fluctuations of light scattering intensity due to diffusion of the molecules allowing thus the determination of their hydrodynamic radius (Rh). Refractive index detector measures the concentration of protein in solution, the dn/dc (specific refractive index increment), and the absolute refractive index of the solution. Measurement of protein concentration is essential for the absolute characterization of the molar mass (14Ye H. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 356: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Using this HPLC/SEC-MALS/UV/RI system, we determined the self-association and the inter-association of the baseplate components, whereas we also measured their hydrodynamic radii. These data, together with some input from literature, made it possible to propose a topological model of the baseplate of Tuc2009, as well as an evaluation of the stoichiometry of the interacting components. We propose this model as a paradigm for the P335 phage species baseplate, with possible extension to other phages infecting Gram-positive bacteria. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—Cloning of full-length ORF49, ORF52, and ORF53 in pQE60 were previously described by Mc Grath et al. (7Mc Grath S. Neve H. Seegers J.F. Eijlander R. Vegge C.S. Brondsted L. Heller K.J. Fitzgerald G.F. Vogensen F.K. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3972-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The DNA regions that represent the N-terminal portion of ORF50 (residues 1-590), the head + neck section of ORF53 (residues 17-172), and the head-only fragment of ORF53 (residues 58-172) were amplified using PCR from the Tuc2009 bacteriophage genome using specific Gateway™ primers containing attB sequences at both ends, a ribosome-binding site, and a C-terminal His6 tag coding sequence. A bicistronic ORF51-ORF53-encoding construct was obtained using a two-step PCR: first, the coding regions of ORF51 and ORF53 were separately amplified using primers P1/INT-R and INT-F/P2, respectively (primer sequences are detailed in Table 2), to introduce a ribosome-binding site upstream from each ORF and allowing the presence of a sequence overlapping the two constructs; second, these two PCR products were used as DNA template for a second amplification with primers P1 and P2. The final construct consisted of DNA specifying a C-terminal His6-tagged ORF51 upstream of DNA encoding a C-terminal Strep-tagged ORF53. The amplicons representing ORF50-(1-590), ORF53-(17-172), ORF53-(58-172) and the bicistronic ORF51-ORF53 were cloned by recombination in a Gateway™ pDEST14 vector (Invitrogen). Protein expression experiments were carried out using M15pREP4 (Qiagen) and Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) strains for pQE60 and pDEST14 constructs, respectively. After an overnight induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 or 17 °C depending on the target, cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 × g. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 40 ml/liter of culture of lysis buffer (Tris 50 mm, NaCl 300 mm, imidazole 10 mm, pH 8.0) supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 μg/ml DNase, 20 mm MgSO4, and antiproteases (Complete EDTA-free antiproteases, Roche) and frozen at -80 °C. After thawing and sonication, lysates were cleared by a 30-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g. Overexpressed proteins were purified on a PharmaciaÁkta FPLC by nickel affinity chromatography (His-Trap 5-ml column, GE Healthcare) using a step-gradient of imidazole followed by a preparative Superdex 200 HR26/60 gel filtration in 10 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. An additional Strep-Tactin affinity purification (IBA BioTAGnology) was used for the purification of the ORF51-ORF53 dual protein complex. Purified proteins were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 ml (Millipore) and characterized by SDS-PAGE, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Brüker Autoflex), trypsin peptide mass fingerprint, far-UV circular dichroism (Jasco J-810), and dynamic light scattering (Zetasizer Nano-S, Malvern).TABLE 2Primers designed for the construction of the ORF51-ORF53 bicistronic geneNameSequence (5′ to 3′)Features P1 GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTAgaaggagatagaaccATGaaaacagaacattt tataacactgtcc AttB1 sequence (italic upper case), ribosome-binding site (underlined), start codon (upper case) P2 GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCttatttttcgaactgcgggtggctccaagc gctattccgataaagttttacaatcatc AttB2 sequence (italic upper case), Strep tag coding sequence (italic), stop codon (bold) INT-F Aaaaatttcgtgggaaaacgggggacatcaccatcaccatcactaagaaggagatagaac cATGaaagctgaattaactaaaattactcgagg His6 tag coding sequence (italic), stop codon (bold), ribosome-binding site (underlined), start codon (upper case) INT-R cctcgagtaattttagttaattcagctttCATggttctatctccttcttagtgatggtga tggtgatgtcccccgttttcccacgaaattttt Open table in a new tab Blue Native PAGE—Blue native PAGE (15Schagger H.

Gels were run following the supplier's instructions loading 5 μg of each protein. Native gels were stained with Coomassie® R-250. The NativeMark™ Unstained Protein Standard (Invitrogen) was used to estimate the molecular weight of proteins after native electrophoresis by plotting Rf (retardation factor) values versus log10 molecular weight. SEC with On-line Multiangle Laser Light Scattering, Absorbance, and Refractive Index (MALS/UV/RI) Detectors—SEC was carried out on an Alliance 2695 HPLC system (Waters) using a Silica Gel KW804 column (Shodex) eluted with 10 mm Hepes and 50 mm NaCl at pH 7.5 at a flow of 0.5 ml/min. Detection was performed using a triple-angle light scattering detector (Mini-DAWN™ TREOS, Wyatt Technology), a quasi-elastic light scattering instrument (Dynapro™, Wyatt Technology), and a differential refractometer (Optilab® rEX, Wyatt Technology). Molecular weight and hydrodynamic radius determination was performed by the ASTRA V software (Wyatt Technology) using a dn/dc value of 0.185 ml/g. Proteins were loaded at a final concentration of 0.02 mm. Production of the Baseplate Proteins—We undertook the production of seven tail and baseplate proteins from Tuc2009: ORF45 (MTP), ORF48 (TMP), ORF49 (Dit), ORF50 (Tal), ORF51 (BppU), ORF52 (BppA), and ORF53 (BppL, representing the RBP). All these proteins could successfully be (over)produced either as full-length products, or as individual domains, using our previously published screening procedure (17Vincentelli R. Bignon C. Gruez A. Canaan S. Sulzenbacher G. Tegoni M. Campanacci V. Cambillau C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18Vincentelli R. Canaan S. Offant J. Cambillau C. Bignon C. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 346: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Except in the case of TMP, all proteins are soluble up to several milligrams/ml, making it possible to perform biophysical characterization and interaction studies on them. ORF45 (MTP) was expressed as a soluble protein and could be concentrated up to 10 mg/ml. However, no further experiments have been performed on it. ORF48 (TMP) is a 1025-residue long protein, which has been demonstrated to control the length of the phage tail (11Pedersen M. Ostergaard S. Bresciani J. Vogensen F.K. Virology. 2000; 276: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions suggest that TMP consists of two domains: a long, almost continuous, α-helix, spanning residues 1 to 960, and a putative mixed α/β domain from residue 961 to the C terminus. It has been suggested that the long α-helix of TMP drives the MTP assembly and interacts at its N terminus with the phage portal, whereas the C-terminal domain, possibly more globular, may interact with the other components of the IC, Dit, and/or Tal (6Vegge C.S.

Sao-Jose C. Lhuillier S. Tavares P. Orlova E.V. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3720-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We cloned two DNA fragments that encompass different sections of TMP: the full-length protein and the 961-1025 C-terminal domain. The former construct was not expressed in any of our screening conditions, whereas the latter was expressed as inclusion bodies, which could not be refolded using our standard procedures (18Vincentelli R. Canaan S. Offant J. Cambillau C. Bignon C. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 346: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ORF49 (Dit) has been proposed to orchestrate the IC formation once a certain concentration of Dit was reached (7Mc Grath S. Neve H. Seegers J.F. Eijlander R. Vegge C.S. Brondsted L. Heller K.J. Fitzgerald G.F. Vogensen F.K. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3972-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Dit was expressed as a soluble protein at concentrations up to 6 mg/ml. However, this protein appeared to be susceptible to protease cleavage, because several time-dependent degradation products appeared on SDS gels. ORF50 (Tal) incorporates a self-cleavage site at a consensus sequence GGSSGG, between the two last Gly (7Mc Grath S. Neve H. Seegers J.F. Eijlander R. Vegge C.S. Brondsted L. Heller K.J.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3480-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The N terminus, encompassing residues 1-590, was proposed to act as a structural domain, whereas the C-terminal domain of this tail fiber (represented by amino acid residues 591-906), bears the catalytic activity: the last 120 residues of its C terminus domain share ∼40% sequence identity with the catalytic domain of a zinc-containing peptidase from Vibrio cholerae, the structure of which has been determined (PDB 2GU1). 4R. Sugadev, D. Kumaran, S. Swaminathan, and S. K. Burley, unpublished data. We therefore cloned the two domains of Tal using the Gateway™ system. Both N- and C-terminal Tal domains are well expressed and soluble. The N-terminal domain could be concentrated up to 7 mg/ml, whereas the C-terminal domain was not subjected to further studies. These three components, TMP C-term, Dit, and Tal N-term, are believed to form the conical structure of the IC. In TP901-1, two proteins have been shown to assemble stepwise around the IC: first BppU, followed by BppL (5Vegge C.S. Vogensen F.K. Mc Grath S. Neve H. van Sinderen D. Brondsted L. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Vegge C.S. Brondsted L. Neve H. Mc Grath S. van Sinderen D. Vogensen F.K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4187-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In Tuc2009, it was assumed that the assembly of these proteins (represented by ORF51 and -53, respectively) may follow the same order (7Mc Grath S. Neve H. Seegers J.F. Eijlander R. Vegge C.S. Brondsted L. Heller K.J. Fitzgerald G.F. Vogensen F.K. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3972-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the situation in Tuc2009 is more complex because ORF52, which is absent in TP901-1, is probably associated with the IC structure. The orf52 gene is located between orf51 and orf53 on the phage genome. Its protein product, ORF52, has been identified among the phage structural proteins, but its exact localization could not be assigned using immuno-gold EM (7Mc Grath S. Neve H. Seegers J.F. Eijlander R. Vegge C.S. Brondsted L. Heller K.J. Fitzgerald G.F. Vogensen F.K. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3972-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Its involvement in the peripheral baseplate is therefore hypothetical. We were able to express ORF51 (BppU) as a soluble protein at a very high concentration of 50 mg/ml. ORF52 (BppA) is also well expressed and is soluble up to 10 mg/ml. These two proteins are stable and no time-dependent cleavage/degradation was detected. ORF53 or BppL acts as the RBP, conferring host specificity (11Pedersen M. Ostergaard S. Bresciani J. Vogensen F.K. Virology. 2000; 276: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We cloned the gene encoding ORF53 (BppL) and expressed it as a soluble protein. It was impossible, however, to obtain the intact protein, due to rapid proteolytic deterioration, probably at the N terminus, yielding shorter species. Protein cleavage has been observed for BppL of TP901-1, because its crystal structure lacks the first 15 residues (8Spinelli S. Campanacci V. Blangy S. Moineau S. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14256-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Characterization of the Oligomerization State of the Tuc2009 Baseplate Proteins—The purified Tuc2009 proteins were subjected to weight and size analysis using the MALS/UV/RI Wyatt instrument (Table 1). ORF49 (Dit) has a theoretical mass of 30,152 Da, and an MS measured mass of 30,100 Da. The MALS/UV/RI analysis generated a measured mass of 29,000 Da, indicating that the molecule is monomeric under the conditions tested, with an Rh value of 3.3 ± 1.0 nm. The ORF50 (Tal) N-terminal domain (1-590) has a theoretical mass of 67,100 Da, and an MS measured mass of 66,800 Da. The MALS/UV/RI measured mass of 190 kDa, which is close to the theoretical value for a trimer ("
https://openalex.org/W2089644287,"Macrophages are a central arm of innate immune defense against intracellular pathogens. They internalize microbes into phagosomes where the invaders are being killed by oxygen and nitrogen reactive species. Despite this battery of antimicrobial molecules, some are able to thrive within the phagosome thus termed intraphagosomal pathogens among which are Salmonella, Leishmania, and Mycobacteria. In mice, a single dominant gene termed Nramp1/Slc11a1 controls innate resistance to such pathogens. This gene is expressed exclusively in myeloid cells. Previously, we have shown that the restricted expression of Nramp1 is regulated by a myeloid cell-specific transcription factor termed IRF-8/ICSBP. It is demonstrated here that the induction of Nramp1 expression in activated macrophages is accompanied by a promoter shift from a repression state elicited by c-Myc to an activation state elicited by the induction of IRF-8 in activated macrophages. This transition from repression to activation is facilitated by a competitive protein-protein interaction with the transcription factor Miz-1. To show that IRF-8 is directly involved in the elimination of intraphagosomal pathogens through the regulation of Nramp1 gene expression, we bred wild type as well as IRF-8 and Nramp1 null mouse strains and examined macrophages derived from bone marrow and peritoneum. Our results clearly show that the absence of IRF-8 and Nramp1 leads to the same phenotype; defective killing of intraphagosomal Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and Mycobacterium bovis. Thus, interplay between repression and activation state of the Nramp1 promoter mediated by IRF-8 provides the molecular basis by which macrophages resist intraphagosomal pathogens at early stage after infection.

Mammals host defense against pathogens depends on both innate and adaptive immunity. Macrophages are essential components of innate immunity and play a key role in host defense mechanisms against invading pathogens. These invading foreign bodies activate the macrophages, which in response engulf and subsequently entrap the pathogens in the phagosome/lysosome compartment. In this specialized compartment, the pathogens are subjected to massive attack by reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates (1Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, macrophages mediate innate resistance to host infection by several antigenically unrelated intraphagosomal pathogens including Salmonella, Leishmania, and Mycobacterium. This is controlled by a single dominant gene termed solute carrier family 11 member a1 (Slc11a1) 2The abbreviations used are: Slc11a1solute carrier family 11 member a1Nramp1natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1Miz-1Myc interacting zinc finger protein 1IFNinterferonIRF-8interferon regulatory factor-8ISREinterferon-stimulated response elementBCGbacille Calmette-GuerinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCFUcolony forming unitm.o.i.multiplicity of infectionBiFCbifluorescence complementationChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationILinterleukinPBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent proteineGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinWTwild type. 2The abbreviations used are: Slc11a1solute carrier family 11 member a1Nramp1natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1Miz-1Myc interacting zinc finger protein 1IFNinterferonIRF-8interferon regulatory factor-8ISREinterferon-stimulated response elementBCGbacille Calmette-GuerinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCFUcolony forming unitm.o.i.multiplicity of infectionBiFCbifluorescence complementationChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationILinterleukinPBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent proteineGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinWTwild type. also known as natural resistance associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1), or Ity/Lsh/Bcg. Nramp1 is a proton/divalent cation antiporter with a unique role in innate resistance to intraphagosomal pathogens and autoimmune disease (for review, see Refs. 2Wyllie S. Seu P. Goss J.A. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Barton C.H. Biggs T.E. Baker S.T. Bowen H. Atkinson P.G. J.

Lett. 2003; 85: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The exact function of Nramp1 as iron and divalent cation transporter is still controversial. It either functions to increase transphagosomal Fe2+ catalyzing the Haber-Weiss/Fenton reaction to generate the highly toxic hydroxyl radical essential for macrophage bactericidal activity. On the other hand, it is thought to deprive the intraphagosomal bacterium of Fe2+ and other divalent cations, which are critical for its survival in the phagosome (2Wyllie S. Seu P. Goss J.A. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In mouse, Nramp1 has two alleles; one allele, Gly-169, restricts pathogen growth, whereas the second allele, Asp-169 (functionally null), is permissive for pathogen growth (5Vidal S.M. Malo D. Vogan K. Skamene E. Gros P. Cell. 1993; 73: 469-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Thus, a single gene product, Nramp1, is indispensable for innate immunity to intraphagosomal pathogens. Importantly, Nramp1 is exclusively expressed in monocyte/macrophage cells (5Vidal S.M. Malo D. Vogan K. Skamene E. Gros P. Cell. 1993; 73: 469-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), whereas its family member Nramp2 is ubiquitously expressed. The transcription factor termed Myc interacting zinc finger protein 1 (Miz-1) mediates the activation of Nramp1 that can be repressed by c-Myc (25Xiong H. Li H. Kong H.J. Chen Y. Zhao J. Xiong S. Huang B. Gu H. Mayer L. Ozato K. Unkeless J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23531-23539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, this interaction between Miz-1 and c-Myc does not explain the macrophage-restricted expression of Nramp1 and its inducibility by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and LPS in comparison to its ubiquitously expressed homologue Nramp2. solute carrier family 11 member a1 natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 Myc interacting zinc finger protein 1 interferon interferon regulatory factor-8 interferon-stimulated response element bacille Calmette-Guerin green fluorescent protein colony forming unit multiplicity of infection bifluorescence complementation chromatin immunoprecipitation interleukin phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein enhanced green fluorescent protein yellow fluorescent protein wild type. solute carrier family 11 member a1 natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 Myc interacting zinc finger protein 1 interferon interferon regulatory factor-8 interferon-stimulated response element bacille Calmette-Guerin green fluorescent protein colony forming unit multiplicity of infection bifluorescence complementation chromatin immunoprecipitation interleukin phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein enhanced green fluorescent protein yellow fluorescent protein wild type. Recently, we have demonstrated that Miz-1 interacts with another transcription factor termed interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF-8) previously known as ICSBP. Furthermore, we have shown that these two factors in conjunction with a third partner, PU.1, synergistically activate Nramp1 (6Alter-Koltunoff M. Ehrlich S. Dror N. Azriel A. Eilers M. Hauser H. Bowen H. Barton C.H. Tamura T. Ozato K. Levi B.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44025-44032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). IRF-8 is expressed mainly in immune cells and its expression can be further induced by IFN-γ and Toll receptor ligands such as LPS or CpG (7Ozato K. Tsujimura H. Tamura T. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: S66-S75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This factor is a key element for the differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells toward macrophages and for mature macrophage activity. Accordingly, IRF-8-/- mice exhibit clinical manifestation that resembles the human chronic myelogenous leukemia. Thus, IRF-8 drives bipotential myeloid progenitor cells toward mature macrophages while inhibiting the differentiation pathway toward granulocytes (8Tamura T. Nagamura-Inoue T. Shmeltzer Z. Kuwata T. Ozato K. Immunity. 2000; 13: 155-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that IRF-8 is an essential factor for proper function of mature macrophages. For example, IRF-8 null mice fail to mount Th1-mediated immune response due to lack of expression of IL-12 p40 subunit (9Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). IRF-8 belongs to a family of 9 cellular members sharing significant similarity at the DNA binding domain. Unlike other IRF members, IRF-8 is capable of binding to target DNA sequence only following association with other IRF or non-IRF transcription factors via the IRF association domain (10Levi B.Z. Hashmueli S. Gleit-Kielmanowicz M. Azriel A. Meraro D. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). IRF-8 associates with transcription factors like IRF-1 and IRF-2 as well as non-IRF members such as PU.1. The latter belongs to the Ets family of transcription factors and is indispensable for the development of lymphoid and myeloid cells (11Dahl R. Simon M.C. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2003; 31: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The interacting partner with IRF-8 dictates not only the DNA binding site but also the transcriptional activity, e.g. activation or repression. Through the formation of such heterocomplexes IRF-8 has an important role in the expression of macrophage genes such as the phagosomal components, phagocyte oxidase complex (phox) (12Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105PubMed Google Scholar), and iNOS (13Xiong H. Zhu C. Li H. Chen F. Mayer L. Ozato K. Unkeless J.C. Plevy S.E. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 6829-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that IRF-8 can interact with Miz-1 only in immune cells (6Alter-Koltunoff M. Ehrlich S. Dror N. Azriel A. Eilers M. Hauser H. Bowen H. Barton C.H. Tamura T. Ozato K. Levi B.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44025-44032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This interaction leads to synergistic activation of the Nramp1 promoter that is not observed in the non-immune cell line. This synergistic interaction is further enhanced with PU.1. These results clarified the molecular basis for the macrophage-restricted expression of Nramp1 and its inducibility by IFN-γ and LPS. In this article, we wished to further explore the Nramp1 promoter with respect to the identification of the exact binding sites for IRF-8 and PU.1. In addition, the competitive interplay between c-Myc and IRF-8 for the association with Miz-1 and the effect on the transcriptional activity of the Nramp1 promoter was investigated. Finally, a direct regulatory cascade linking IRF-8 and Nramp1 sequential expression to macrophages susceptibility/resistance to intraphagosomal pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and Mycobacterium bovis (bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)) is described. Animals—The mouse strains, C57BL/6J, 129/Sv (both were from Harlan Biotech, Israel), and C57BL/6J IRF-8-/- (17Holtschke T. Lohler J. Kanno Y. Fehr T. Giese N. Rosenbauer F. Lou J. Knobeloch K.P.

Cell. 1996; 87: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) were maintained in individually ventilated cages under pathogen-free conditions. The C57BL/6J IRF-8-/- mice were backcrossed with 129/Sv for 8 generations to replace the defective Nramp1 allele generating a new knock-out mouse strain 129/Sv IRF-8-/-. The presence of defective IRF-8 and functional Nramp1 were validated by PCR of genomic DNA from mouse tails. All animal work conformed to the guidelines of the animal care and use committee of the Technion. Cell Lines—Murine bone marrow-derived RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), CL2 macrophage cells, established from IRF-8 knock-out mice, were previously reported (9Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), R37 and R21 cells (constitutively expressing functional Nramp1 or antisense to Nramp1, respectively) were a kind gift from Dr. Barton (Southampton University, United Kingdom) (18Atkinson P.G. Barton C.H. Immunology. 1999; 96: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 40 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics. 5 ng/ml M-CSF and CSF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were added to the growth medium of CL2 cells and 50 μg/ml of gentamycin was added to the growth medium of R37 and R21 cells. Treatment with IFN-γ and LPS and killing assays were performed as described for peritoneal macrophages. NIH3T3 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Isolation of Bone Marrow and Peritoneal Macrophages—Bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs of the various mouse strains and cultured for 7 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 30% CCL1 cell culture supernatant, 20% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, and antibiotics in nontissue culture plates. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested as described previously (6Alter-Koltunoff M. Ehrlich S. Dror N. Azriel A. Eilers M. Hauser H. Bowen H. Barton C.H. Tamura T. Ozato K. Levi B.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44025-44032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 2.5 × 107 cells were plated in tissue culture Petri dishes (100 mm) and kept at 37 °C and 6% CO2 for 4 h and then non-adherent cells were removed by 2 washes with PBS. Intracellular Pathogens—S. enterica serovar typhimurium 14028 (ATCC) stably expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was kindly obtained from Dr. Yaron (Technion, Israel). Following 18 h growth (LB medium without antibiotics) the bacterial culture was diluted 1:10 and A600 was measured. Salmonella concentration was calculated as colony forming unit (CFU) per ml using 1 OD = 1.2 × 109 CFU/ml. The cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in mammalian culture medium. Macrophages were infected at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 15-30. The Leishmania donovani stably expressing eGFP was a kind gift of Dr. Zilberstein (Technion, Israel). The cells were maintained in M199 culture medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 26 °C that favors flagellate promastigote form as described (19Zilberstein D. Dwyer D.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For the assays, the parasites were collected from end-log-phase cultures, centrifuged at 800 × g, washed with PBS, counted after fixation with paraformaldehyde, and adjusted to the required parasite m.o.i. of 10. Macrophage Killing Assay—Killing assay with S. enterica serovar typhimurium was performed as described by Monak et al. (20Monack D.M. Raupach B. Hromockyj A.E. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9833-9838Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Macrophages (either bone marrow derived or peritoneal) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and the cells were gently scraped and plated at 3 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates in a medium without antibiotics. The cells were either not treated or treated for 18 h with 100 units/ml IFN-γ (CytoLab, Rehovot, Israel) and 50 ng/ml LPS (Sigma). Cells were infected in triplicates with S. enterica serovar typhimurium 14028 expressing at m.o.i. of 15-30. The 24-well plates were centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min and placed in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 40 min. This point in the experiment was determined as the zero point. At this stage gentamycin (50 μg/ml) was added to kill non-phagocytized bacteria and to assess intracellular growth. At the indicated time intervals post-infection, cells were washed 3 times with PBS, lysed with 200 μl of 1% deoxycholate, serially diluted, plated onto LB agar plates, and CFU (viable bacteria) were determined. For killing assay with M. bovis (BCG), bone marrow-derived macrophages from various mouse strains were plated and activated with IFN-γ and LPS as described above. Macrophages were then infected with live M. bovis (BCG) at m.o.i. of 10 for 4 h, the adherent cells were washed twice, and fresh growth medium was added. Cells were harvested and lysed in 2 ml of sterile water, and 100-μl aliquots were used for preparing serial dilution of the bacteria. The diluted lysates were placed on oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase-supplemented Middlebrook 7H11 Bacto-agar (Difco), and colonies were counted visually after 14 days. Plasmids—Mammalian expression vectors encoding for Miz-1, IRF-8, IRF-1, and PU.1 were all described previously (6Alter-Koltunoff M. Ehrlich S. Dror N. Azriel A. Eilers M. Hauser H. Bowen H. Barton C.H. Tamura T. Ozato K. Levi B.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44025-44032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for c-Myc in pCDNA3.1 was a gift of Dr. Eilers (Marburg University, Germany). The reporter construct -1555 containing murine Nramp1 prompter in the reporter vector pGL3 was a gift from Dr. Barton (Southampton University). The various 5′ progressive Nramp1 promoter deletion constructs were generated by PCR and following sequence validation were cloned into pGL3 basic (Promega). Primer sequence is available upon request. Site-directed mutagenesis to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE, the binding site for IRF-8) and the PU.1 binding sites within the mouse Nramp1 promoter was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primer sequence is available upon request. Cells Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—Assays were performed exactly as described before (6Alter-Koltunoff M. Ehrlich S. Dror N. Azriel A. Eilers M. Hauser H. Bowen H. Barton C.H. Tamura T. Ozato K. Levi B.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44025-44032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using the Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega). Luciferase activities were determined and normalized for transfection efficiency. -Fold of synergism was calculated as the ratio between the -fold of activation elicited by the two transfected factors divided by the sum of the -fold of activation for each factor alone. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times. Bifluorescence Complementation (BiFC)—The plasmid IRF-8-YCC was previously described (23Laricchia-Robbio L. Tamura T. Karpova T. Sprague B.L. McNally J.G. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14368-14373Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The plasmid Miz-1-YNC was generated by PCR amplification of the coding region of Miz-1 with primers adding EcoRI and HindIII at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and cloned into the corresponding restriction sites in the plasmid YNC (23Laricchia-Robbio L. Tamura T. Karpova T. Sprague B.L. McNally J.G. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14368-14373Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 3.5 × 104 NIH3T3 cells/chamber were seeded in sterile 4-well slide chamber. 18 h later, cells were transfected by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) with 0.25 μg of the YFP constructs and 0.5 μg of pHcRed1-C1 (Clontech) for 24 h. The later served as a control reporter plasmid to confirm that BiFC took place within a nucleus of a transfected cell. In addition, 0.75 μg of plasmid encoding for c-Myc was cotransfected as indicated. The cells were allowed to stand at 30 °C for 1 h, and YFP and red fluorescent protein signals were viewed under confocal microscopy. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—RAW264.7 cells were grown to a final concentration of 1 × 107 with or without treatment with IFN-γ (100u/ml) for 12 h and ChIP assays were performed as described previously (24Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Sova P. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were incubated for 6 h with 5 μg of anti-goat IgG or anti-goat IRF-8 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or acetyl-specific histone 3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed for the presence of the murine Nramp1 promoter sequence by semiquantitative or quantitative PCR using the following primers: 5′-GGAGAGGAACGAAGGTCAAAAC-3′ (sense), 5′-CTGGCAACTAGCTCCTCAAT-3′ (antisense); and 5′-GGGTATCCAGGAGAGGAACGA-3′ (sense), 5′-CACACACTTGGCGTTTCGAA-3′ (antisense), respectively. Retroviral Transduction—pMSCV-IRES-EGFP is a retroviral expression vector that has a bicistronic cassette that enables expression of IRES-driven EGFP, with no encoded gene in the first position. It was generated by digesting the bicistronic cassette from pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) with XhoI and MfeI and cloned into pMSCV digested with XhoI and EcoRI. To generate the retroviral pMSCV-IRF8-IRES-EGFP expression vector, the cDNA for human IRF-8 was digested with PmeI and MfeI and cloned into the HpaI and EcoRI in the retroviral vector pMSCV-IRES-EGFP. Retroviruses were generated as described (25Xiong H. Li H. Kong H.J. Chen Y. Zhao J. Xiong S. Huang B. Gu H. Mayer L. Ozato K. Unkeless J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23531-23539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) by seeding 4 × 106 293FT cells in a 10-cm dish. The next day, cells were transfected using DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate containing 2.5 μg of plasmid pMD.G encoding vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, 7.5 μg of plasmid pMD.OGP encoding gag-pol, and 10 μg of the retroviral expression constructs. 48 h after transfection, the viral supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 800 × g, and used to infect bone marrow macrophages that were seeded at 7.5 × 106 cells/well in a 12-well plate in a final volume of 1.5 ml. 24 h later, 0.5 ml of medium was remove and replaced with 0.5 ml of freshly prepared viruses and Polybrene was added to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml. The plates were spinoculated at 1200 × g for 90 min at 33 °C. After 24 h, 1 ml of the medium was replaced with fresh medium and 1 day later transfection efficiency was monitored under a fluorescent microscope and the transduced cells were selected with puromycin (3 μg/ml) for an additional 7 days and then used for Salmonella killing assay. Statistical Analysis—Each experiment was repeated three times yielding similar results and statistical significance was determined by Student's t test with a p < 0.05. Deletion Analysis of the Nramp1 Promoter Revealed the Binding Sites for IRF-8 and PU.1—Our previous studies provided the molecular basis for the restricted expression of Nramp1 in activated macrophages. This is due to synergistic interaction between Miz-1, IRF-8, and PU.1. However, the exact binding sites for the myeloid-specific factors were not determined. Computer aided analysis identified several putative binding sites for IRF-8 (termed ISRE) and PU.1 along the -1555 bp of the Nramp1 promoter region. To test which of the putative binding sites serve as ISRE and PU.1 binding sites, reporter gene constructs harboring progressive 5′ promoter deletions were generated (see illustrations in Fig. 1A). RAW264.7 cells were cotransfected with these reporter constructs together with Miz-1 and IRF-8 (Fig. 1B, front row) as well as with PU.1 (Fig. 1B, back row). As expected, the full-length promoter construct (-1555) was synergistically activated by Miz-1 and IRF-8 (Fig. 1B, black bar, front row). This activation was further enhanced by PU.1 (Fig. 1B, black bar, back row). The synergistic effect of Miz-1 and IRF-8 was also noted with the reporter constructs -167 and -139 (gray bar and striped bar, front row, respectively). However, removing just four bases from -139 to -135 abolished PU.1 enhancement (dotted bar, back row). This 4-bp deletion, TTCC/GGAA, harbors a consensus binding site for PU.1. As expected, transfection with the -96 reporter construct exhibited no effect with PU.1 (checkered bar, back row) and in addition the synergistic effect of both IRF-8 and Miz-1 was abolished (checkered bar, front row). In this reporter construct, half of the palindrome GTTTCGAAAC was deleted. This palindrome fits the consensus of an ISRE and suggests that it serves as an IRF-8 binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed for these two ISRE and PU.1 binding sites. As seen in Fig. 1C, mutating the PU.1 binding site did not affect Miz-1 and IRF-8 synergistic activation of this mutated construct but the additional enhancement with PU.1 was abolished. Similarly, mutating the ISRE binding site resulted in loss of the synergistic effect between IRF-8 with Miz-1. These results allowed us to assign these two binding sites as PU.1 and ISRE, respectively. To establish our findings that IRF-8 regulates Nramp1 expression by binding to its promoter, RAW264.7 cells were either not activated or activated with IFN-γ for 12 h and ChIP assays were preformed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The primers used for the PCR were designed to include the ISRE and PU.1 binding sites on the Nramp1 promoter. The binding of IRF-8 to Nramp1 promoter was evident by semi-quantitative PCR only under IFN-γ induced conditions (Fig. 1D). The relative binding of IRF-8 to the Nramp1 promoter in the induced cells was increased by almost 5-fold (Fig. 1E). The specificity of the ChIP assay was evaluated using goat immunoglobulins (IgG, negative control) and acetyl-specific histone 3 antibody (positive control, data not shown). These results support the in vitro findings and provide in vivo evidence for the recruitment of IRF-8 to the Nramp1 promoter in the IFN-γ-activated macrophage cell line. c-Myc Negates IRF-8 and Miz-1 Transcriptional Synergy on Nramp1 Promoter—As shown above, Nramp1 is induced in activated macrophages through synergistic association between IRF-8 and Miz-1. On the other hand, other reports demonstrated that c-Myc represses Nramp1 transcription by binding to Miz-1 and displacing the p300 co-activator, a paradigm for the repressive action of c-Myc (26Bowen H.

Immunol. 1997; 224: 137-146PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that Miz-1 interaction with either c-Myc or IRF-8 might affect Nramp1 enhanceosome activity leading to repression or activation, respectively. To test the effect of c-Myc on the synergistic activation of the Nramp1 promoter by IRF-8 and Miz-1, reporter gene assays were performed. The Nramp1 reporter construct (-1555) was co-transfected with expression vectors for IRF-8, Miz-1, and c-Myc. As previously shown (6Alter-Koltunoff M. Ehrlich S. Dror N. Azriel A."
https://openalex.org/W2008153140,"We previously reported that Gβγ signaling regulates cell spreading or cell shape change through activation of a Rho family small GTPase, suggesting the existence of a Gβγ-regulated Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF). In this study we examined various RhoGEF clones, found FLJ00018 to beaGβγ-activated RhoGEF, and investigated the molecular mechanism of Gβγ-induced activation of Rho family GTPases. Co-expression of the genes for FLJ00018 and Gβγ enhanced serum response element-mediated gene transcription in HEK-293 cells. Combined expression of Gβγ and FLJ00018 significantly induced activation of Rac and Cdc42 but not RhoA. FLJ00018 also enhanced gene transcription induced by carbachol-stimulated m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and this enhancement was blocked by pertussis toxin. Furthermore, we demonstrated Gβγ to interact directly with the N-terminal region of FLJ00018 and the N-terminal fragment of this molecule to inhibit serum response element-dependent transcription induced by Gβγ/FLJ00018 and carbachol. In NIH3T3 cells, FLJ00018 enhanced lysophosphatidic acid-induced cell spreading, which was also blocked by the N-terminal fragment of FLJ00018. These results provide evidence for a signaling pathway by which Gi-coupled receptor specifically induces Rac and Cdc42 activation through direct interaction of Gβγ with FLJ00018. We previously reported that Gβγ signaling regulates cell spreading or cell shape change through activation of a Rho family small GTPase, suggesting the existence of a Gβγ-regulated Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF).

FLJ00018 also enhanced gene transcription induced by carbachol-stimulated m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and this enhancement was blocked by pertussis toxin. Furthermore, we demonstrated Gβγ to interact directly with the N-terminal region of FLJ00018 and the N-terminal fragment of this molecule to inhibit serum response element-dependent transcription induced by Gβγ/FLJ00018 and carbachol. In NIH3T3 cells, FLJ00018 enhanced lysophosphatidic acid-induced cell spreading, which was also blocked by the N-terminal fragment of FLJ00018. These results provide evidence for a signaling pathway by which Gi-coupled receptor specifically induces Rac and Cdc42 activation through direct interaction of Gβγ with FLJ00018. Rho family small GTPases belong to the Ras superfamily, comprise more than 20 distinct proteins, and control a wide variety of cellular processes. First identified as regulators of the actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 induce stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia formation, respectively, and it is now clear that Rho family proteins play pivotal roles in cell migration, outgrowth, extension and path-finding of neuritis, and gene transcription. Like other small GTPases, Rho GTPases cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar, 2Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3840) Google Scholar). This cycling of Rho GTPases is controlled by three distinct classes of regulatory proteins, namely (i) guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, which stabilize the inactive form (3DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In particular, 60 different GEFs for Rho family members (RhoGEFs) have been described so far (4Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). A common feature of RhoGEFs is the Dbl homology (DH) domain responsible for exchange activity followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain considered to be involved in subcellular localization. Besides this tandem motif, RhoGEFs often contain one or more additional signal transduction domains, such as PDZ, Src homology (SH) 2, SH3, and RGS (regulator of G protein signaling), which can function as molecular bridges between different signal transduction pathways. guanine-nucleotide exchange factor GEF for Rho family member Dbl homology domain pleckstrin homology domain G protein-coupled receptor lysophosphatidic acid m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Dulbecco's modified essential medium serum response element Rac/Cdc42 binding domain RhoA binding domain glutathione S-transferase wild type. guanine-nucleotide exchange factor GEF for Rho family member Dbl homology domain pleckstrin homology domain G protein-coupled receptor lysophosphatidic acid m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Dulbecco's modified essential medium serum response element Rac/Cdc42 binding domain RhoA binding domain glutathione S-transferase wild type. It is well established that a large variety of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly those coupling to the G12/13 type of heterotrimeric G proteins, are upstream regulators of Rho proteins (7Kozasa T.

A family of RhoA-specific GEFs consisting of p115RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), which mediate this activation process, has been identified (7Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J.

All these proteins contain in addition to the DH/PH tandem motif an RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) homology domain for direct interaction with and activation by G12 type G proteins. More than a dozen Rac-specific RhoGEFs have been described so far, including for example Vav, Sos, Tiam, and P-Rex (4Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Some of these GEFs are specific for Rac, and others have more broad targets, but all have activities that are tightly regulated, usually by protein kinases (11Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H.

We have previously reported that Gβγ induces actin stress fiber and focal adhesion formation in a Rho-dependent manner in HeLa cells (19Ueda H. Itoh H. Yamauchi J. Morishita R. Kaziro Y. Kato K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2098-2102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and that Gi signals through both Gαi2 and Gβγ regulate Rac and Cdc42 during lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced cell spreading in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (20Ueda H. Morishita R. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6846-6852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Others have described Gi-coupled receptor signaling to induce cell migration and neurite outgrowth (21Srinivasan S. Wang F. Glavas S. Ott A. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Kalman D. Bourne H.R. J.

These results suggest the presence of G protein-regulated RhoGEFs, but the details of the underlying molecular mechanisms have yet to be clarified. In the present study we searched for Gβγ-regulated RhoGEFs in various RhoGEF clones in the Kazusa HUGE data base and the NEDO data base and found FLJ00018/PLEKHG2 (23Garcia-Mata R. Burridge K. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 36-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) to link specifically the Gi-coupled receptor to Rac and Cdc42 by directly interacting with Gβγ subunits. This RhoGEF, therefore, represents a hitherto unknown Gβγ effector molecule. Materials—pCMV5-FLAG-RhoAT19N, pCMV5-FLAG-Rac1T17N, and pCMV5-FLAG-Cdc42T17N were generous gifts from Dr. H. Itoh (Nara Institute of Science and Technology). pcDNA3.1-Gαi2QL, pcDNA3.1-GαsQL, pcDNA3.1-GαqQL, pcDNA3.1-Gα11QL, pcDNA3.1-Gα12QL, pcDNA3.1-Gα13QL, pcDNA3.1-Gβ1, pcDNA3.1-Gγ2, and pcDNA3.1-m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m2 receptor) were from UMR cDNA Resource Center. Complementary DNA clones for RhoGEF genes were isolated during the Kazusa human cDNA project, which aimed to accumulate information on the coding sequences of long cDNAs for unidentified human genes (24Nakajima D. Okazaki N. Yamakawa H. Kikuno R. Ohara O. Nagase T. DNA Res. 2002; 9: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To construct native-form protein expression clones, the open reading frames of all RhoGEF cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNA-DEST-47 vector used by the Gateway system (Invitrogen). cDNAs encoding deletion mutants of FLJ00018, as indicated in the corresponding figures, were generated by restriction enzyme digestion or polymerase chain reaction amplification using pcDNA-DEST-47-FLJ00018 as a template. Plasmids encoding Myc-tagged FLJ00018 and its mutants were subcloned into the pCMV5 vector. The pSRE.L-luciferase reporter plasmid was purchased from Stratagene, and pRL-SV40 was from Nippon Gene. LPA was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., pertussis toxin was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem, glutathione-coupled Sepharose 4B beads were from GE Healthcare, and fibronectin and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against the Gβ subunit generated by ourselves has been described previously (25Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Gαq/11, Gα12, Gα13, Gαs, and RhoA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A mouse monoclonal antibody against Myc epitope (9E10) was purchased from Roche Applied Science, and mouse monoclonal antibodies against human Rac1 and Cdc42 were from BD Transduction Laboratories. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293 and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HEK-293) or 10% calf serum (NIH3T3) at 37 °C. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). To examine the effect of m2 muscarinic stimulus on serum response element (SRE)-dependent gene transcription, cells were co-transfected with the m2 receptor and FLJ00018 or other plasmids and cultured for 16 h in DMEM supplemented with 1× insulin-transferrin-selenium-X supplement (Invitrogen). Then cells were washed twice with DMEM, incubated for 2 h in DMEM, and stimulated with 1 mm carbachol for 6 h. Assay of SRE-dependent Gene Transcription—HEK-293 cells seeded on 24-well plates were co-transfected with the indicated expression plasmids (400 ng of total DNA/well) together with the pSRE.L-luciferase reporter plasmid and the pRL-SV40 control reporter vector. After transfection, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with passive lysis buffer (Nippon Gene). Luciferase activities were determined with the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (PicaGene Dual SeaPansy Luminescence kit, Nippon Gene). The activity of the experimental reporter was normalized against the activity of control vector. Pulldown Assays of Activated Rho Family GTP-binding Proteins—The cellular level of GTP-loaded Rac, Cdc42, and RhoA was determined using a GST fusion protein containing the Rac/Cdc42 binding domain of PAK (GST-CRIB) expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli DH5α (20Ueda H.

In brief, subconfluent HEK-293 cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of plasmid DNA or the corresponding empty vectors (2 μg/6-cm dishes). Thereafter, the cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, and the particular fraction was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with GST-CRIB bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After three washes of beads, bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Rac, Cdc42, and RhoA were then detected by immunoblotting with specific monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitation—HEK-293 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes and transfected at 80% confluence with 2 μg of the indicated cDNA constructs. After transfection, cells were solubilized in 300 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, 2 μg of anti-c-Myc antibody was added to the clear supernatant, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, added to protein G-agarose, and gently shaken for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 3 times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer and loaded onto a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. After SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and detected with anti-Myc and anti-Gβ antibodies. In Vitro Binding Assays—GST or GST-p7 fusion proteins were expressed and extracted from E. coli strain DH5α and bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Three μg of purified GST fusion protein (with the glutathione-agarose beads) and 3 μg of Gβγ subunit (purified from bovine brain) (28Asano T. Morishita R. Matsuda T. Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20512-20519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated for 3 h at 4°C in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Beads were washed three times with buffer A, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with an anti-Gβ antibody. Cell Spreading Assays—NIH3T3 cells, which were transfected with GFP and indicated plasmids, were detached with trypsin-EDTA and washed with DMEM containing 0.3 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Cells were then re-suspended in DMEM, re-plated on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips, and incubated for 15 min in the presence or absence of 10 μm LPA. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for immunocytochemistry. To quantitate cell spreading, images of cells were obtained using a laser-scanning microscope (LSM-510, Carl Zeiss), and the areas of GFP-positive cells were measured using LSM-510 image analysis software. For each experiment, the areas of 50 cells were quantitated. Statistical Analysis—All results shown are the means ± S.D. of values from at least three independent experiments. The significance of group differences was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni correction. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Identification of a RhoGEF Inducing Gβγ-dependent Gene Transcription—To search for Gβγ-dependent RhoGEFs, we screened various RhoGEF clones in the Kazusa HUGE data base and the NEDO data base by co-expression with Gβ1γ2 in HEK-293 cells. To monitor Rho family GTPase activations in intact cells, we measured transcription of an SRE-controlled reporter gene (SRE.L-luciferase), which is known to be induced by Rho family activation. Overexpression of several RhoGEF clones containing KIAA0380 (no. 4), KIAA0424 (no. 5), KIAA0521 (no. 6), and FLJ00018 (no. 10) caused an increase in luciferase expression, and co-expression with Gβ1γ2 greatly increased FLJ00018-induced gene transcriptional activity and slightly enhanced KIAA0424-induced activity (Fig. 1). Co-expression of Gβ1γ2 with other RhoGEF clones caused a small increase or did not enhance RhoGEF-induced gene transcriptional activity (Fig. 1). Gβγ/FLJ00018-induced SRE-dependent Gene Transcription Is Mediated by Rac and Cdc42—To clarify which subtype of Rho family proteins contributes to increase of SRE-dependent gene transcription by FLJ00018, we examined the effects of various Rho family mutants. A dominant negative mutant of Rac1 completely inhibited SRE-dependent gene transcription induced by FLJ00018, whereas that of Cdc42 inhibited it to a lesser extent, and a dominant negative Rho was without effect (Fig. 2A). To provide further support for FLJ00018-dependent activation of Rac and Cdc42, we carried out pulldown assays using GST-CRIB and GST-RBD as a direct readout of Rho family GTPases activation. Expression of FLJ00018 alone only slightly increased the amount of active Rac (1.1 times) and Cdc42 (1.2 times), and combined expression of FLJ00018 and Gβ1γ2 induced Rac activation by 2.1 times and Cdc42 activation by 1.5 times (Fig. 2B). However, expression of FLJ00018 or FLJ00018/Gβ1γ2 did not influence RhoA activation. Gβγ, but Not Gα Subunits, Enhances FLJ00018-induced SRE-dependent Gene Transcription—Because the data obtained so far argued for activation of FLJ00018 by Gβ1γ2, we studied the influence of various Gα subunits on FLJ00018-induced luciferase expression. GTPase-deficient Gα mutants induced transcriptional activity in a range similar to that observed with co-expression of FLJ00018, although strong transcriptional activity was observed with several Gα mutants containing GαqQL, Gα11QL, Gα12QL, and Gα13QL (Fig. 3A). Next, we studied the effect of various Gγ subunits, Gγ2, Gγ5, Gγ7, and Gγ12, co-expressed with Gβ1 on FLJ00018-induced luciferase expression, but there were no differences among them (Fig. 3B). FLJ00018 Enhances m2 Receptor-induced SRE-dependent Gene Transcription—It is generally accepted that Gβγ-mediated signaling mainly acts through Gi/o-coupled receptors. To examine whether these might stimulate SRE-dependent transcription through FLJ00018, we co-expressed FLJ00018 together with the m2 receptor in HEK-293 cells. M2 receptors preferentially couple to Gi/o proteins but can additionally activate other G proteins. The combined expression of FLJ00018 and the m2 receptor led to a significant enhancement of luciferase expression by carbachol stimulation, whereas such stimulation was not observed in cells expressing FLJ00018 alone (Fig. 4A). The dominant negative mutant of Rac1 strongly inhibited carbachol-induced luciferase production, but those of RhoA and Cdc42 did not (Fig. 4A), consistent with the results obtained for Gβγ-induced transcription (Fig. 2A). Co-expression of the dominant negative mutant of RhoA increased carbachol-induced luciferase production, although the reason remains unclear. This may raise the possibility that a RhoA dominant negative mutant cancels the attenuation of Rac activation by RhoA. The α subunits of Gi family G proteins were specifically ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin, then became unable to couple with GPCRs. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin eliminated carbachol-stimulated luciferase production in cells co-transfected with m2 receptor and FLJ00018 (Fig. 4B). Wortmannin Does Not Influence Gβγ/FLJ00018-induced SRE-dependent Gene Transcription and Rac Activation—The RacGEF, P-Rex1, is directly regulated by Gβγ like FLJ00018, but full activation of P-Rex1 requires the binding of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (16Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To examine the requirement of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate for FLJ00018 activation, we used an inhibitor for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, wortmannin. The treatment of wortmannin did not influence Gβγ/FLJ00018-induced SRE-dependent gene transcription (Fig. 5A). Wortmannin seemed to be functional, because 100 nm wortmannin inhibited 10% fetal bovine serum-stimulated SRE-dependent gene transcription by 40% as compared with control. Gβγ/FLJ00018-induced Rac activation was also unaffected by wortmannin (Fig. 5B). The activation mechanism of FLJ00018 seems to be different from the one of P-Rex1. In the future, however, it is necessary to compare the phosphoinositide dependence of two molecules in detail. Gβγ Interact Directly with the N-terminal Region of FLJ00018—To investigate whether FLJ00018 directly interacts with Gβγ, Gβ1γ2 and N-terminal Myc-tagged FLJ00018 were co-expressed in HEK-293 cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and analyzed for co-precipitated Gβ protein. As shown in Fig. 6A, the Gβ subunit co-precipitated with the wild-type FLJ00018 (WT). To identify the part of FLJ00018 in which this interaction takes place, we performed similar experiments with seven truncated mutants; WT (amino acids (aa) 1–1386), p1 (aa 1–964), p2 (aa 1–464), p3 (aa 1–309), p4 (aa 108–309), p5 (aa 1–108), p6 (aa 1–149), p7 (aa 1–134). The mutant p4 was immunoprecipitated to a similar extent as WT and other mutants with the anti-Myc antibody but did not form a complex with the Gβ subunit (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the three mutants containing the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–108), p5, p6, and p7, co-precipitated with the Gβ subunit. To examine whether the N-terminal region of FLJ00018 binds directly Gβγ, Gβγ proteins purified from bovine brain were mixed with GST and GST-p7 fusion protein in vitro. As shown in Fig. 6B, the Gβ subunit bound p7-GST fusion protein but not GST (Fig. 6B). To further study the properties of these mutants, we investigated the ability of each to activate SRE-dependent transcription (Fig. 6C). The mutants lacking the PH domain such as p3, p4, and p5 were inactive, suggesting this domain is strictly required. These results resemble those with PDZ-RhoGEF deletion mutants (9Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and the binding of RhoGEF to lipids or other molecules through the PH domain seems to be necessary for the activation of several RhoGEF molecules. In contrast, p1 and p2 enhanced luciferase production more than WT, but the levels of luciferase production induced by co-expression of Gβ1γ2 were similar to that induced by the combination of WT and Gβγ (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that the C-terminal region of FLJ00018 is inhibitory for the GEF activity, and binding of Gβγ may release this inhibition. The P7 Deletion Mutant of FLJ00018 Inhibits Gβγ- and m2 Receptor-induced FLJ00018-dependent Gene Transcription—Because the deletion mutant p7, like p5 and p6, binds Gβγ dimer but has no GEF activity, expression of this mutant would be expected to block Gβγ-induced FLJ00018 activation. Indeed, co-expression of p7 with FLJ00018, Gβ1γ2, or Gβ1γ2 plus FLJ00018 dose-dependently reduced the luciferase production (Fig. 7A). In addition, p7 also suppressed induction of luciferase production by the m2 receptor stimulated by carbachol (Fig. 7B). The P7 Deletion Mutant of FLJ00018 Inhibits LPA/FLJ00018-indued Cell Spreading—We have previously shown Rac and Cdc42 to be activated by Gi during LPA-induced cell spreading in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (20Ueda H. Morishita R. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6846-6852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine whether the expression of FLJ00018 and p7 influences LPA-induced cell spreading, we co-transfected these plasmids and GFP into NIH3T3 cells and re-plated in the presence or absence of LPA. FLJ00018 expression significantly enhanced cell spreading in the presence of LPA after 15 min, whereas LPA did not (Fig. 8A). Co-expression of p7 markedly diminished LPA/FLJ00018-induced cell spreading. To examine the requirement of functional domains (PH domain) in cell spreading, we transfected the deletion mutants of PH domain and replated on fibronectin-coated coverslips in the presence of LPA. The cell spreading of the mutant-expressed cells was similar to mock cells (mock, 166.2 ± 21.2; wild type, 478.0 ± 59.6; mutant, 135.6 ± 21.5). These observations suggest that FLJ00018 functions as a Rac/Cdc42 RhoGEF downstream of Gβγ during LPA-induced cell spreading. It has been well documented that Gβγ subunits induce activation of Rho family GTPases in a variety of cells and tissues (19Ueda H. Itoh H. Yamauchi J. Morishita R. Kaziro Y. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2098-2102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Ueda H. Morishita R. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol.

Because there is increasing evidence that such activation occurs independently of the phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway, it is most likely that hitherto unidentified RhoGEFs are involved. In this report we present several lines of evidence that FLJ00018, a novel member of the Dbl family of GEFs, might represent the specific GEF or at least one of the GEFs, mediating the response. First, FLJ00018 greatly enhanced the transcriptional activity with Gβγ subunits but not with GTPase-deficient mutants of various Gα subunits. This increase in transcriptional activity was completely sensitive to the dominant negative mutant of Rac1. Second, FLJ00018 enhanced the transcriptional activity when the primarily Gi/o-coupled m2 receptor was stimulated by carbachol. This enhancement was blocked by pertussis toxin. Similarly, FLJ00018 enhanced LPA-induced cell spreading. Third, co-expression of FLJ00018 and Gβγ subunits synergistically increased the cellular amount of activated Rac and Cdc42 proteins, although Rac was more intensely activated. Finally, FLJ00018 directly interacted with Gβγ subunits, as detected by means of direct binding in vitro and co-immunoprecipitation as well as by functional inhibition of Gβγ-induced gene transcription and cell spreading by the N-terminal fragment of FLJ00018 including the Gβγ binding domain (p7). Therefore, our data indicate that FLJ00018 is a novel RhoGEF for Rac and Cdc42 that is regulated by Gβγ subunits. So far it has been shown that Gβγ could activate several RhoGEFs: Ras-GRF1 (31Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), P-Rex1 (16Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R.

Res. 2003; 93: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Ras-GRF1, P-Rex1, and P-Rex2 are Rac-specific RhoGEFs, and p114RhoGEF is a RhoGEF for RhoA and Rac. Ras-GRF1 has to be tyrosine-phosphorylated to display RacGEF activity (31Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). p114RhoGEF binds Gβγ subunits both via its DH/PH tandem and its C terminus, but it is not known whether they regulate the catalytic activity of this GEF (34Niu J. Profirovic J. Pan H. Vaiskunaite R. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), identical to KIAA0521 (no. 6 in Fig. 1), which increased SRE-dependent gene expression but did not further increase it with co-expression of Gβγ in our experiments. Dimers of the Gβ1 subunit with different Gγ subunits varied in their ability to stimulate P-Rex1 in vitro. The β1γ3, β1γ7, β1γ10, and β1γ13HA dimers all activated P-Rex1 with similar EC50 values, whereas dimers composed of β1γ12 had lower EC50 values (35Mayeenuddin L.H. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1913-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present study, co-expression of Gβ1 and various Gγ subunits including Gγ12 showed similar effects on SRE-dependent gene transcription through FLJ00018 activation. These results indicate that Gβγ-induced activation of FLJ00018 is clearly different from that of P-Rex family, Ras-GRF, or p114RhoGEF. Structural analyses of these RhoGEFs further showed FLJ00018 to be a novel type of GEF. FLJ00018 is 71% identical to the mouse orthologue, Clg, overall, with 94% identity in the DH domain, 96% identity in the PH domain, and differing most in C-terminal region (36Himmel K.L. Bi F.

Although FLJ00018 contains DH and PH domains in the N-terminal region like P-Rex1, the sequence in other regions is completely different (16Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). For example, P-Rex1 contains two DEP domains, two PDZ domains, and a C-terminal InsPx4-phosphatase domain, but these are not present in FLJ00018. In PC12 cells, both PDZ and InsPx4-phosphatase domain, but not PH domain, are required for optimal activity of P-Rex1 (37Yoshizawa M. Kawauchi T. Sone M. Nishimura Y.V. Terao M. Chihama K. Nabeshima Y. Hoshino M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4406-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, PH domain is required for optimal activity of FLJ00018 (Fig. 6C). The C-terminal region of FLJ00018 is predicted to have a Formin homology 1 domain (38Higgs H.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 342-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) from Pfam 21.0 analysis, although the sequence homology is low. Several reports demonstrated that the Formin homology 1 domain is a binding site for profilin (38Higgs H.N. Trends Biochem.

Alberts A.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 435-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Because profilin is a G-actin-binding protein that promotes the addition of monomers to the barbed-end of actin filaments, its binding to Formin homology 1-like domains of FLJ00018 would be expected to contribute to efficient formation of actin filaments around the areas where FLJ00018 is recruited and Rac/Cd42 is activated in cells. Recently, a series of interactions between Rho-GEFs and scaffolding proteins containing PDZ domains have been described (23Garcia-Mata R. Burridge K. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 36-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are small protein interaction domains that mediate protein targeting and the assembly of multiprotein complexes. FLJ00018 also contains a putative PDZ binding motif at the C terminus. The function of the region is remains uncertain in the regulatory mechanism of FLJ00018 activity. In summary, the data presented herein define a new signaling pathway for GPCRs, with FLJ00018 serving as a direct Gβγ effector molecule as shown in Fig. 9. Its postulated linkage of GPCRs to Rac/Cdc42 and Rac/Cdc42-dependent pathways ultimately would be predicted to affect the cytoskeletal structure, nuclear gene expression, and cellular growth."

Among the earliest responses to T3 are the up-regulation of T3 receptor β (TRβ; autoinduction) and BTEB1 (basic transcription element-binding protein 1). BTEB1 is a member of the Krüppel family of transcription factors that bind to GC-rich regions in gene promoters. The proximal promoter of the Xenopus laevis TrβA gene has seven GC-rich sequences, which led us to hypothesize that BTEB1 binds to and regulates TrβA. In tadpoles and the frog fibroblast-derived cell line XTC-2, T3 up-regulated Bteb1 mRNA with faster kinetics than TrβA, and Bteb1 mRNA correlated with increased BTEB1 protein expression. BTEB1 bound to GC-rich sequences in the proximal TrβA promoter in vitro. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we show that BTEB1 associates with the TrβA promoter in vivo in a T3 and developmental stage-dependent manner. Induced expression of BTEB1 in XTC-2 cells caused accelerated and enhanced autoinduction of the TrβA gene. This enhancement was lost in N-terminal truncated mutants of BTEB1. However, point mutations in the zinc fingers of BTEB1 that destroyed DNA binding did not alter the activity of the protein on TrβA autoinduction, suggesting that BTEB1 can function in this regard through protein-protein interactions. Our findings support the hypothesis that BTEB1 associates with the TrβA promoter in vivo and enhances autoinduction, but this action does not depend on its DNA binding activity. Cooperation among the protein products of immediate early genes may be a common mechanism for driving developmental signaling pathways.

Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All vertebrates possess two Tr genes designated Trα and Trβ (also known as NR1A1 and NR1A2, respectively); Xenopus laevis has two Trα and two Trβ genes each designated A or B because of its pseudotetraploidy (2Yaoita Y. Shi Y.B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone is the primary morphogen controlling tadpole metamorphosis, and TRs are ligand-dependent transcription factors. One of the earliest gene regulation events during amphibian metamorphosis is the up-regulation of Trβ genes by T3 (3Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1917-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This regulation depends on TRs binding to thyroid hormone-response elements (TREs) present in the Trβ promoters (receptor autoinduction; see Refs. 2Yaoita Y. Shi Y.B. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Although Sp1 and BTEB1 have very similar DNA binding domains, and they bind to similar or identical consensus DNA sequences, the two proteins are completely different outside of the DBD. In addition to other KLF family members, three proteins designated BTEB2, -3, and -4 have been identified in mammals, although the BTEB2 appears to be more distantly related to BTEB1 than the other two proteins (19Dang D.T.

Whether these proteins function as transcriptional activators or repressors may depend on the architecture of the specific promoter and the chromatin environment (15Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urrutia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 206.1-206.8Crossref Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Based on the early response kinetics of the Bteb1 and TrβA genes, the observation that the protein products of these genes are expressed in the same cells (13Hoopfer E.D. Huang L.Y. Denver R.J. Dev. Growth Differ. 2002; 44: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the identification of seven GC-rich regions in the proximal X. laevis TrβA promoter, we hypothesized that TrβA may be a target gene for BTEB1. We further hypothesized that the up-regulation of BTEB1 plays a role in the autoinduction of TrβA, perhaps functioning as an accessory transcriptional activator. Here we show that the kinetics of Bteb1 mRNA up-regulation in response to T3 are faster than TrβA and that BTEB1 binds to regions of the proximal TrβA promoter that contain GC boxes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we show that BTEB1 associates with the TrβA promoter in vivo in a T3- and developmental stage-dependent manner. Forced expression of BTEB1 in the X. laevis fibroblast cell line XTC-2 (37Pudney M. Varma M.G.R. Leake C.J. Experientia (Basel). 1972; 29: 466-467Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) accelerates the activation of the TrβA promoter and expression of endogenous TrβA mRNA in response to T3. This action depends on the first 30 amino acids of BTEB1, but not on its DNA binding capacity, because point mutations in the zinc fingers did not alter the activity. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the up-regulation of BTEB1 by T3 plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of the TrβA gene during tadpole development. Animals and Hormone Treatments—Tadpoles of X. laevis were reared in dechlorinated tap water (water temperature, 20-22 °C) and fed pulverized frog brittle (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI). Developmental stages were assigned according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (NF) (38Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis Daudin. North Holland Publishers, Amsterdam1956Google Scholar). Tadpoles were treated with 3,5,3′-l-triiodothyronine (T3; sodium salt; Sigma) by adding it to the aquarium water to a final concentration of 10 nm for various times; water was changed and hormone replenished daily over the treatment period. Tadpoles were then euthanized by immersion in 0.01% benzocaine (Sigma), and whole brains and tails were collected for RNA or ChIP analyses (see below). Animal care was in accordance with institutional guidelines. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from tadpole brains or XTC-2 cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was treated with DNase I (Roche Applied Science) prior to reverse transcription to remove genomic DNA contamination following the methods of Manzon and Denver (39Manzon R.G. Denver R.J. J. Endocrinol. 2004; 182: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The DNase-treated RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II (0.5 μl, 200 units/μl; Invitrogen), and 0.2 to 2 μl of the resulting cDNA was used for PCR. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Standard PCRs were initiated in 25 μl containing 10× PCR buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, dNTP mix (1.25 mm each), forward and reverse primers for each gene of interest (10 μm), and TaqDNA polymerase (1.25 units; Promega, Madison, WI). Each thermal cycle consisted of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The number of cycles for each gene was determined empirically by constructing linear amplification curves. We used 32 cycles for Bteb1, 36 for TrβA, and 28 for ribosomal protein L8 (rpL8; a housekeeping gene used to normalize for RNA loading and cDNA synthesis). Oligonucleotide primer sequences for Bteb1 are given in Table 1. Primer sequences used for rpL8 and TrβA were as described by Manzon and Denver (39Manzon R.G. Denver R.J. J. Endocrinol. 2004; 182: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and densitometry was conducted using Scion Image Software (version 3.0, Scion Corp.). The band densities of Bteb1 and TrβA amplicons for each sample were normalized to the densities of the rpL8 bands.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used for semi-quantitative and quantitative real time RT-PCRSemi-quantitative RT-PCRBteb1Forward5′-CGTGGCAAAGTTTATGGG-3′Reverse5′-GGATGGAAGTCGGTATGG-3′TaqMan AssaysTrβAForward5′-GGAAGCCACTGGAAACAGAAAA-3′Reverse5′-CATTAACTATGGGAGCTTGTCCAA-3′ProbeFAM-AAAATTTTTGCCAGAGGAC-MGBNFQBteb1bForward5′-CCAGTCAGGTCAACCAATGAAA-3′Reverse5′-AAACTTTGCCACACCCAGTGT-3′ProbeFAM-AGG CAC AGG TGT CC-MGBNFQrpL8Forward5′-TTTGCTGAAAGAAATGGCTACATC-3′Reverse5′-CAC GGC CTG GAT CAT GGA-3′ProbeVIC-AGG GTA TTG TGA AAG ACA-MGBNFQ Open table in a new tab Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR)—For quantitative RT-PCR (RTqPCR), we developed TaqMan assays and analyzed samples on an ABI 7500 fast real time PCR machine using Taq-Man Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). The primer/probe sets used are given in Table 1 and were designed to span exon/intron boundaries. Standard curves were generated using cDNAs from the time point that exhibited the highest expression level for each gene to provide for a relative quantitation. TrβA and Bteb1 mRNAs were normalized to the level of rpL8 mRNA. Plasmid Constructs—The pCMV-xBTEB1 expression plasmid was described by Hoopfer et al. (13Hoopfer E.D. Huang L.Y. Denver R.J. Dev. Growth Differ. 2002; 44: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The X. laevis TrβA promoter-luciferase plasmid (40Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. Yun-Bo Shi. Full-length and N-terminal truncated mutants of BTEB1 were generated by PCR (primers in Table 2), and cDNA fragments were directionally cloned into the pCS2 vector. The choice of deletions was based on the location of two putative transactivation domains (A and B) located in rat BTEB1 (41Kobayashi A. Sogawa K. Imataka H. Fujiikuriyama Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that are highly conserved in Xenopus BTEB1 (13Hoopfer E.D. Huang L.Y. Denver R.J. Dev. Growth Differ. 2002; 44: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCS2-xBTEB1Δ30 has a deletion of the first 30 amino acids that includes transactivation domain A; pCS2-xBTEB1Δ99 has both transactivation domains A and B removed; and pCS2-xBTEB1Δ120 represents only the DNA binding domain.TABLE 2Oligonucleotide primers used to generate truncated mutants and point mutations in the three zinc fingers of X. laevis BTEB1Primers used to generate N-terminal truncated xBTEB1 mutantsΔ30 xBTEB1 For5′-ATAGGATCCGCCGCCATGGAAGTGGAGCAGCCC-3′Δ99 xBTEB1 For5′-ATAGGATCCGCCGCCATGGAGTTAAACAAGTACC-3′Δ120 xBTEB1 For5′-ATAGGATCCGCCGCCATGGACAGCGATGTCACCA-3′xBTEB1 Rev5′-ATACTCGAGTCAGGTGAATGATGAATTGGAC-3′Primers used to generate point mutations in the three zinc finger domains of xBTEB1xBTEB1 H211A5′-GTCTTCCCATCTCAAAGCCGCTTACAGAGTCCATACAGGT-3′xBTEB1 H241A5′-CCGATGAGTTAACTCGCGCCTACAGAACCCACACAG-3′xBTEB1 H269A5′-TGAGAAGCGATCACTTGACCAAAGCTGCACGTCGCCA-3′ Open table in a new tab The plasmid construct pCS2-xBTEB1 C2AH harbors histidine to alanine substitutions (H211A, H241A, and H296A) in the first histidine residues of each of the three zinc fingers of BTEB1. This construct was generated using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with pCS2-xBTEB1 as template and three primers shown in Table 2. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—We conducted electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described by Hoopfer et al. (13Hoopfer E.D. Huang L.Y. Denver R.J. Dev. Growth Differ. 2002; 44: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The BTE and mutated BTE probes used were as described by Yanagida et al. (16Yanagida A. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K-I. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1470-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Bacterial cell lysate containing the fusion protein GST-xBTEB1[DBD] was prepared as described by Hoopfer et al. (13Hoopfer E.D. Huang L.Y. Denver R.J. Dev. Growth Differ. 2002; 44: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recombinant wild type BTEB1 or BTEB1 C2AH mutant were produced in vitro using the TnT SP6 Quick Coupled Translation System (Promega). For EMSA, 1 μl of a 1:512 dilution of GST-xBTEB1[DBD] lysates or varying volumes of the in vitro translated proteins were incubated in a volume of 35 μl with 20,000 cpm of 32P-BTE and 1.4 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm KCl, and 20% glycerol. For antibody supershifts, proteins were preincubated for 20 min prior to the addition of 32P-BTE with 1 μg of normal rabbit serum IgG or affinity-purified anti-xBTEB1 IgG that recognizes only the N-terminal region of the protein (see below). The reaction continued at room temperature for 40 min before fractionation by nondenaturing 6% PAGE in 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA (TBE). Gels were fixed in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, and processed for autoradiography. The ability of regions of the proximal X. laevis TrβA promoter (GenBank™ accession number U04675) to displace GST-xBTEB1[DBD] binding to the 32P-BTE was tested by competitive EMSA (1.89 μm for each competitor DNA). The X. laevis trβA promoter fragments were generated by PCR and gel-purified using QIAEX II (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The regions of the promoter that we analyzed are shown in Fig. 2 and supplemental Table 1, and the oligonucleotides used to amplify the sequences by PCR are given in Table 3.TABLE 3Oligonucleotide primers used for the analysis of the X. laevis TrβA promoterTrβA promoter region−1138/−823 (A)5′-CAG TGG AGT AAC TAC CAG-3′5′-GTA CAC ATG CCT GCA CTA-3′−841/−604 (B)5′-TAG TGC AGG CAT GTG TAC-3′5′-GAG CAG GTG CAG CAT CTA-3′−622/−414 (C)5′-TAG ATG CTG CAC CTG CTC-3′5′-ACT ATG GCA TGT TAC AGC-3′−432/−266 (D)5′-GCT GTA ACA TGC CAT AGT-3′5′-GCC TGA GTG AAG ACC CAT-3′−283/−92 (E)5′-ATG GGT CTT CAC TCA GGC-3′5′-GTC ATG AAA CTC CTC GGT-3′−109/+182 (F)5′-ACC GAG GAG TTT CAT GAC-3′5′-TAT AGA CAC AGG CAG CTT A-3′+164/+366 (G)5′-TAA GCT GCC TGT GTC TAT A-3′5′-TGA CAG TCA GAG GAA CTG A-3′Exon 3/exon 45′-CAG AAA CCT GAA CCC ACA CAA-3′5 ′-CAC TTT TCC ACC CTC GGG CGC ATT-3′qPCR −885/−7525′-TTG TGC CTG CTT GCT TGC TA-3′5′-ACT ATA ATA GGC GGG CCA AGC TGA-3′qPCR +165/+3225′-AGC TGC CTG TGT CTA TAC TGA TGG-3′5′-ACA GGG AGA TCT ACA GCT GAT CGT-3′qPCR exon 55′-CCC CGA AAG TGA AAC TCT AAC GT-3′5′-AAA CCA CTC CAA GTC CTC CAT TTT-3′Ef1α promoter5′-TGC ACA GTT GGC GCA GTG-3′5′-TGA GGA AGA GAG CGA ACC-3′Ifabp promoter5′-ATA GCA GCA GGT GGT TGC G-3′5′-GGC CAC AAG ATC TAC TCG-3′ Open table in a new tab We then synthesized short oligonucleotide probes for EMSA containing predicted GC boxes in the TrβA promoter fragments that demonstrated competitive binding to GST-xBTEB1[DBD] (see above).

https://openalex.org/W2023591791,"Migration patterns in modern societies have created the opportunity to use population admixture as a strategy to identify susceptibility genes. To implement this strategy, we genotyped a highly informative ancestry marker panel of 2270 single nucleotide polymorphisms in a random population sample of African Americans (N = 1743), European Americans (N = 1000) and Mexican Americans (N = 581). We then examined the evidence for over-transmission of specific loci to cases from one of the two ancestral populations. Hypertension cases and controls were defined based on standard clinical criteria. Both case-only and case-control analyses were performed among African Americans. With the genome-wide markers we replicated the findings identified in our previous admixture mapping study on chromosomes 6 and 21 [1]. For case-control analysis we then genotyped 51 missense SNPs in 36 genes spaced across an 18.3 Mb region. Further analyses demonstrated that the missense SNP rs2272996 (or N131S) in the VNN1 gene was significantly associated with hypertension in African Americans and the association was replicated in Mexican Americans; a non-significant opposite association was observed in European Americans. This SNP also accounted for most of the evidence observed in the admixture analysis on chromosome 6. Despite these encouraging results, susceptibility loci for hypertension have been exceptionally difficult to localize and confirmation by independent studies will be necessary to establish these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2056691444,"Neurotrophic factors play an important role in the development and maintenance of not only neural but also nonneural tissues. Several neurotrophic factors are expressed in dental tissues, but their role in tooth development is not clear. Here, we report that neurotrophic factor neurotrophin (NT)-4 promotes differentiation of dental epithelial cells and enhances the expression of enamel matrix genes. Dental epithelial cells from 3-day-old mice expressed NT-4 and three variants of TrkB receptors for neurotrophins (full-length TrkB-FL and truncated TrkB-T1 and -T2). Dental epithelial cell line HAT-7 expressed these genes, similar to those in dental epithelial cells. We found that NT-4 reduced HAT-7 cell proliferation and induced the expression of enamel matrix genes, such as ameloblastin (Ambn). Transfection of HAT-7 cells with the TrkB-FL expression construct enhanced the NT-4-mediated induction of Ambn expression. This enhancement was blocked by K252a, an inhibitor for Trk tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, a downstream molecule of TrkB, was induced in HAT-7 cells upon NT-4 treatment. TrkB-FL but not TrkB-T1 transfection increased the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 in NT-4-treated HAT-7 cells. These results suggest that NT-4 induced Ambn expression via the TrkB-MAPK pathway. The p75 inhibitor TAT-pep5 decreased NT-4-mediated induction of the expression of Ambn, TrkB-FL, and TrkB-T1, suggesting that both high affinity and low affinity neurotrophin receptors were required for NT-4 activity. We found that NT-4-null mice developed a thin enamel layer and had a decrease in Ambn expression.

Mammalian development is a complex and highly orchestrated process that involves intricate cross-talk between growth factors and other regulatory molecules. The interaction between the epithelium and mesenchyme induces specific molecular and cellular changes that lead to organogenesis. These interactions are particularly crucial during the initiation of the development of ectodermal organs, such as teeth, skin, hair, and mammary and prostate glands (1Thesleff I. Vaahtokari A. Partanen A.M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 35-50PubMed Google Scholar). The oral epithelium provides the initial signaling for neuronal crest-derived ectomesenchyme development, and then both tissues interact during tooth formation. Various transcription factors, growth factors, and extracellular matrices are expressed by enamel matrix-producing ameloblasts during tooth development (2Zeichner-David M. Diekwisch T. Fincham A.

Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 128-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Ambn, also known as amelin or sheathlin, is a tooth-specific glycoprotein that represents the most abundant non-Amel enamel matrix protein. We previously created Ambn-null mice, which develop severe enamel hypoplasia in which ameloblasts detached from the matrix, lost cell polarity, resumed proliferation, and formed multiple cell layers (6Fukumoto S.

These results suggest that Ambn is essential for ameloblast differentiation and enamel formation.Nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 and -4/5 (NT-3 and NT-4/5, respectively) are structurally and functionally related and belong to the neurotrophin family, which promotes the development and survival of the vertebrate nervous system (7Barbacid M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1386-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Neurotrophins interact with two classes of cell surface receptors. The first class is Trk tyrosine kinase receptors that bind neurotrophins with a high affinity (8Barbacid M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). TrkA mediates the biological response of NGF, TrkC is activated by NT-3, and BDNF and NT-4/5 are the preferred ligands for TrkB (7Barbacid M. J.

NT-4 was also reported to accelerate catagen development in murine skin organ cultures. These results suggest that NT-4 is useful as an agent of hair growth control.During tooth development, neurotrophic factors and their receptors are expressed in the tooth germ (20Luukko K. Arumae U. Karavanov A. Moshnyakov M. Sainio K. Sariola H. Saarma M. Thesleff I. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, their role in tooth development has not been elucidated. At the initiation stages of tooth germ development, NGF is expressed in the dental mesenchyme and weakly in the dental epithelium. At the bud stage, the majority of dental epithelial cells have lost their NGF expression, although NGF is still expressed in the inner dental epithelium and condensed mesenchyme. During later embryonic and early postnatal tooth development, NGF can be observed in the dental follicles. At the bell stage, NGF appears in epithelial cells of the stratum intermedium, whereas after birth it is restricted to cells located in the cervical part of the enamel organ. In the postnatal period, NGF is also detected in the dental papilla mesenchyme. BDNF is expressed in the region of developing rat teeth as well as in the mesenchyme under the developing skin of the mandibular process (20Luukko K. Arumae U. Karavanov A. Moshnyakov M. Sainio K. Sariola H. Saarma M. Thesleff I. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In postnatal animals, BDNF is mainly detected in the dental papilla, and its expression pattern is correlated with the onset of dental innervation (21Nosrat C.A. Fried K. Lindskog S. Olson L. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). NT-3 is expressed throughout the mesenchyme of the mandibular process at the initiation stage, whereas it appears in the epithelial cervical loops in the cap stage. During later stages, NT-3 expression is gradually restricted to the more cervical parts of the inner enamel epithelium and is no longer detected in postnatal tooth germs (20Luukko K. Arumae U. Karavanov A. Moshnyakov M. Sainio K. Sariola H. Saarma M. Thesleff I. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The expression of NT-4 is restricted to epithelial cells. During subsequent development, expression persists in all dental epithelium components, including ameloblasts and the outer enamel epithelium as well as in the dental lamina (20Luukko K. Arumae U. Karavanov A. Moshnyakov M. Sainio K. Sariola H. Saarma M. Thesleff I. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Nosrat C.A. Fried K. Lindskog S. Olson L. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Among neurotrophic factors, NT-4 is the only one detected in differentiated ameloblasts. These findings suggest that NT-4 may be important for dental epithelium differentiation and maintenance of ameloblast functions. However, the role of NT-4 in tooth development is unknown.In the present study, we investigated the roles of NT-4 and TrkB in tooth development in vitro using dental epithelium cultures and in vivo using NT-4 knock-out mice. NT-4 and TrkB receptors were expressed in the dental epithelium of 3-day-old mice and in the HAT-7 dental epithelial cell line. We found that NT-4 inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation of HAT-7 cells. NT-4 treatment of HAT-7 cells increased mRNA expression for enamel matrix proteins Ambn, Enam, and dentin sialophosphoprotein. Further, NT-4-mediated induction of Ambn expression was regulated by the full-length TrkB-FL receptor and ERK1/2 pathway. In NT-4 knock-out mice, Ambn expression was dramatically reduced, and the enamel layer was thin. Our findings suggest that NT-4 plays a role in proliferation and differentiation of the dental epithelium and is required for the expression of enamel matrix genes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and TransfectionHAT-7 cells, an epithelial cell line, and mDP cells, a dental mesenchymal cell line, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 (22Yuasa K.

To transfect with the expression vectors for TrkB, HAT-7 cells were plated in a 60-mm plastic tissue culture plate (Falcon) at a density of 1 × 106 cells/3 ml/plate. To facilitate the detection of protein expression, V5 and His tags were fused to the C terminus of the two rat TrkB isoforms, TrkB-FL and TrkB-T1. TrkB-FL and TrkB-T1 cDNA were prepared from adult rat brain mRNA by RT-PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The forward primer for TrkB-FL and TrkB-T1 was 5′-CTCTGACTGACTGGCACTGG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GCCTAGGATGTCCAGGTAGACGGGC-3′ for TrkB-FL or 5′-CCCATCCAGGGGGATCTTA-3′ for TrkB-T1. PCR was performed at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s for 30 cycles. The PCR products were cloned into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stable transfectant cells for TrkB-FL and TrkB-T1 were selected in the presence of 5 μg/ml Blasticidin (Invitrogen).Cell Proliferation and Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) IncorporationCells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/ml/well in 12-well plates for 24 h. Cell numbers were determined using a trypan blue dye exclusion method. For the BrdUrd incorporation assay, cells were incubated at the same cell density described above for 24 h prior to the addition of various growth factors. After treatments with various growth factors, BrdUrd (Sigma) was added to the plates (10 μm) for 30 min, and then the cells were fixed with cold methanol for 10 min, rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated for 30 min in 1.5 m HCl. After washing three times in PBS, the plates were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the cells were washed in PBS three times and incubated with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. BrdUrd-positive cells were examined under a microscope (Biozero-8000; Keyence, Japan).Western BlottingCells were plated in 12-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well for 1 day prior to NT-4 treatment. The cells were then treated with 100 ng/ml NT-4 for 0–60 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, they were washed twice with ice-cold 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) in PBS, lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer supplemented with a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged, and then the supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube. The cell lysates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. The blotted membrane was incubated with antibodies, and the signals were detected with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). ERK and second antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling.RNA Isolation and RT-PCRDeveloping molars were dissected from mice on postnatal day 1 (P1), P3, and P7. Epithelial and mesenchymal tissues were separated from tooth germ from P3 mice under a microscope. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA was synthesized at 42 °C for 90 min using oligo(dT)14 primer with SuperScript III (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was performed using the primers listed insupplemental Table 1. The PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel. The relative expression level was deduced from a standard curve constructed using the positive control sample and normalized against the expression level of HPRT in each sample.Protein Kinase-inhibitory AssaySerum-deprived HAT-7 cells were plated in 6-well plates and treated with 0.5 μm K-252a (Trk tyrosine kinase inhibitor; Calbiochem) and 100 nm TAT-Pep5 (p75NTR signaling inhibitor; Calbiochem) prior to treatment with NT-4 for 30 min. After 48 h, total RNA was extracted, and RT-PCR was performed.Preparation of Tissue Sections and HE StainingMouse heads from P1, P3, and P7 wild-type and NT-4 null mice were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The tissues were decalcified with 250 mm EDTA/PBS for 3 days, dehydrated in xylene through a graded ethanol series, and then embedded in paraffin. Sections were sliced at 8 μm using a microtome (RM2125RT; Leica). For detailed morphological analysis of the molars, the sections were stained with Harris hematoxylin (Sigma) and Eosine Y (Sigma). The widths of enamel matrix and dentin were measured under a microscope (Bisozero-8000).RESULTSExpression of NT-4 and TrkB Receptors in the Tooth Germs and Dental Cell LinesWe first examined the expression of NT-4 and TrkB receptors in tooth germs and dental cell lines by RT-PCR. In tooth germs of P3 mice, NT-4 was highly expressed in the dental epithelium and weakly expressed in the dental mesenchyme (Fig. 1A). The full-length TrkB-FL and truncated TrkB-T1 and -T2 were expressed in the dental epithelium. On the other hand, TrkB-T1, but not TrkB-FL or TrkB-T2, was expressed in the mesenchyme. Further, p75 expression levels were low in both the epithelium and mesenchyme (Fig. 1A). The expression patterns of NT-4, TrkBs, and p75 in dental epithelial cell line HAT-7 and dental mesenchyme cell line mDP were similar to those in the tooth germ tissues, except for a low expression level of TrkB-FL in mDP cells and a high expression level of p75 in HAT-7 cells (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that NT-4, TrkB-FL, TrkB-T1, and TrkB-T2 are expressed in the dental epithelium and may regulate differentiation of the dental epithelium.Inhibition of Proliferation of HAT-7 Cells by NT-4We next examined the effect of NT-4 on HAT-7 cell proliferation (Fig. 2). HAT-7 cells were treated with NT-4, and cell proliferation was analyzed by BrdUrd incorporation for 1 h. The number of BrdUrd-positive cells was decreased by 30% after stimulation with NT-4 (Fig. 2, A and B). We also found that the number of HAT-7 cells was decreased by about 25% when the cells were cultured in the presence of NT-4 for 7 days (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that NT-4 inhibits the proliferation of dental epithelial cells in culture.FIGURE 2NT-4 inhibits cell proliferation. Dental epithelial cells (HAT-7) were cultured with NT-4 for 24 h. BrdUrd incorporation after 1 h was analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (A and B). Cell numbers of HAT-7 cells cultured with or without NT-4 were counted using a trypan blue exclusion method after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of culture (C). These experiments were repeated at least five times with similar results. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (*, p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NT-4 Induces Ambn ExpressionTo analyze the effects of neurotrophic factors on dental epithelium differentiation, NGF, BDNF, or NT-4 was added to HAT-7 cell cultures. After 48 h, total RNA was analyzed for the expression of ameloblast differentiation markers by RT-PCR. Ambn, Enam, dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp), osteopontin (Opn), and osteonectin (Osn) were induced by NGF, BDNF, and NT-4 (Fig. 3, A and B). Amel was also induced by NT-4 (data not shown). This effect was similar on all of the various amelogenin isoforms. The expression level of Ambn induced by NT-4 was higher than those by NGF or BDNF (Fig. 3B). The induction of Ambn expression by BDNF or NT-4 was dose-dependent (Fig. 3C), with the higher level by NT-4. The expression of gap junctional proteins (Gja1) and transforming growth factor-β1 was the same between the control and neurotrophic factor-treated cells (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that NT-4 induces enamel matrix genes and promotes ameloblast differentiation.FIGURE 3Expression of tooth marker genes in HAT-7 cells with neurotrophic factors. HAT-7 cells were cultured with 100 ng/ml NGF, BDNF, or NT-4 for 48 h. Total mRNA was analyzed for the expression of various genes by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Ambn, Enam, dentin sialophosphoprotein (Dspp), osteopontin (Opn), osteonectin (Osn), connexin 43 (Cx43), and transforming growth factor-β1(Tgf-β1)(A). Hprt was used as an internal control. The level of gene expression in the absence of growth factors was set at 1 for comparison (B and D). HAT-7 cells were stimulated with various amounts of NT-4 and BDNF for 48 h. Hprt expression showed no significant difference between each culture. The level of Ambn expression in cells without factors was set at 1 for comparison (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NT-4 and BDNF Induce Expression of Their Receptor but Not p75Since the expression level of TrkB receptors is important for NT-4 signaling, we examined their expression in HAT-7 cells with or without NT-4 by RT-PCR (supplemental Fig. 1). We found that TrkB-FL, TrkB-T1, and TrkB-T2 were highly induced by NT-4 and BDNF. NGF also induced the expression of TrkB-FL and TrkB-T1, but not TrkB-T2 (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B).Overexpression of TrkB-FL Enhances NT-4-mediated Ambn InductionNT-4 induced expression of Ambn, TrkB-FL, and truncated TrkB. However, it is not clear which receptor is active for NT-4-mediated Ambn induction. To assess this question, we stably transfected HAT-7 cells with the TrkB-FL or TrkB-T1 expression construct, cultured them with NT-4, and analyzed Ambn expression by RT-PCR. Ambn expression was induced by NT-4 in untransfected cells as shown in Figs. 3, A and B, and 4A. This NT-4-mediated Ambn induction was increased in TrkB-FL-transfected cells (Fig. 4, A and B). The basal level of Ambn expression was also higher in the transfected cells than in untransfected cells. However, in TrkB-T1-transfected cells, NT-4-mediated Ambn induction was inhibited (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar results were obtained from immunohistological analysis using Ambn antibody (data not shown). Furthermore, Ambn expression induced by NT-4 in TrkB-FL transfectants was completely inhibited by K252a, a Trk tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fig. 4, C and D). These results indicate that the induction of Ambn by NT-4 is regulated via TrkB-FL but not by truncated TrkB-T1.FIGURE 4Increase in NT-4-mediated Ambn induction in HAT-7 cells by overexpressing TrkB-FL. The expression constructs for TrkB-FL and TrkB-T1 receptors were stably transfected into HAT-7 cells. The pooled transfected cells were treated with NT-4 for 48 h. Ambn expression was analyzed using RT-PCR (A). The level of Ambn expression in the control cells without NT-4 was set at 1 for comparison (B). The TrkB-FL transfectant cells were cultured with or without K252a in the presence of NT-4 for 48 h and then analyzed for the expression of Ambn (C). The level of gene expression in the control cells without NT-4 was set at 1 for comparison (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NT-4 Activates ERK1/2In neuronal cells, NT-4 induces phosphorylation of TrkB and activates the Ras-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway (8Barbacid M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). To analyze NT-4 signaling in the dental epithelium, we performed Western blotting using anti-phospho-specific ERK1/2 (MAPK) antibody. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was observed at 5 min after stimulation with NT-4 and then disappeared after 30 min (Fig. 5A). Further, the level of phosphorylation of ERK2 was higher than that of ERK1 (Fig. 5B). Next, we examined the ERK1/2 phosphorylation level in TrkB-transfected HAT-7 cells in the presence of NT-4 (Fig. 6, A and B). TrkB-FL-transfected cells showed strong activation of ERK1/2 at 5 min after the NT-4 treatment. However, the activation of ERK1/2 was not observed in TrkB-T1-transfected cells. These results indicate that full-length TrkB-FL is a major TrkB receptor for NT-4 signaling, and truncated TrkB-T1 acts as a dominant negative factor for dental epithelial cells.FIGURE 5Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 stimulated by NT-4. The time course of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 after NT-4 treatment was analyzed by Western blotting (IB) using the anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (A).

To identify the signaling pathway involved in Ambn expression, we treated HAT-7 cells with the Trk inhibitor K252a or p75 inhibitor TAT-pep5 prior to stimulation with NT-4 (Fig. 7, A and B). NT-4-medaited induction of Ambn was significantly inhibited by K252a and TAT-pep5. Moreover, the induction of TrkB receptors by NT-4 was also inhibited by K252a and TAT-pep5. The inhibitory effect by K252a was higher than that by TAT-pep5. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited phosphorylation of neurotrophic factor-induced ERK1/2, and PD98059 treatment also inhibited the NT-4-mediated Ambn induction in HAT-7 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that ligand-induced activation of TrkB and p75 is important for the expression of Ambn, TrkB-FL, and TrkB-T1.FIGURE 7Inhibition of NT-4-mediated induction of Ambn and TrkBs by K252a and TAT-pep5.

https://openalex.org/W1966015585,"The HIV-1 maturation inhibitor, 3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl) betulinic acid (bevirimat, PA-457) is a promising drug candidate with 10 nM in vitro antiviral activity against multiple wild-type (WT) and drug-resistant HIV-1 isolates. Bevirimat has a novel mechanism of action, specifically inhibiting cleavage of spacer peptide 1 (SP1) from the C-terminus of capsid which results in defective core condensation.Oral administration of bevirimat to HIV-1-infected SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice reduced viral RNA by >2 log(10) and protected immature and mature T cells from virus-mediated depletion. This activity was observed at plasma concentrations that are achievable in humans after oral dosing, and bevirimat was active up to 3 days after inoculation with both WT HIV-1 and an AZT-resistant HIV-1 clinical isolate. Consistent with its mechanism of action, bevirimat caused a dose-dependent inhibition of capsid-SP1 cleavage in HIV-1-infected human thymocytes obtained from these mice. HIV-1 NL4-3 with an alanine-to-valine substitution at the N-terminus of SP1 (SP1/A1V), which is resistant to bevirimat in vitro, was also resistant to bevirimat treatment in the mice, and SP1/AIV had replication and thymocyte kinetics similar to that of WT NL4-3 with no evidence of fitness impairment in in vivo competition assays. Interestingly, protease inhibitor-resistant HIV-1 with impaired capsid-SP1 cleavage was hypersensitive to bevirimat in vitro with a 50% inhibitory concentration 140 times lower than for WT HIV-1.These results support further clinical development of this first-in-class maturation inhibitor and confirm the usefulness of the SCID-hu Thy/Liv model for evaluation of in vivo antiretroviral efficacy, drug resistance, and viral fitness."
https://openalex.org/W1964680962,"Attempts over the last three decades to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the Anopheles gambiae species complex have been important for developing better strategies to control malaria transmission.We used fingerprint genotyping data from 414 field-collected female mosquitoes at 42 microsatellite loci to infer the evolutionary relationships of four species in the A. gambiae complex, the two major malaria vectors A. gambiae sensu stricto (A. gambiae s.s.) and A. arabiensis, as well as two minor vectors, A. merus and A. melas.We identify six taxonomic units, including a clear separation of West and East Africa A. gambiae s.s. S molecular forms. We show that the phylogenetic relationships vary widely between different genomic regions, thus demonstrating the mosaic nature of the genome of these species. The two major malaria vectors are closely related and closer to A. merus than to A. melas at the genome-wide level, which is also true if only autosomes are considered. However, within the Xag inversion region of the X chromosome, the M and two S molecular forms are most similar to A. merus. Near the X centromere, outside the Xag region, the two S forms are highly dissimilar to the other taxa. Furthermore, our data suggest that the centromeric region of chromosome 3 is a strong discriminator between the major and minor malaria vectors.Although further studies are needed to elucidate the basis of the phylogenetic variation among the different regions of the genome, the preponderance of sympatric admixtures among taxa strongly favor introgression of different genomic regions between species, rather than lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphism, as a possible mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2082197055,"Background Soil ecology has produced a huge corpus of results on relations between soil organisms, ecosystem processes controlled by these organisms and links between belowground and aboveground processes. However, some soil scientists think that soil ecology is short of modelling and evolutionary approaches and has developed too independently from general ecology. We have tested quantitatively these hypotheses through a bibliographic study (about 23000 articles) comparing soil ecology journals, generalist ecology journals, evolutionary ecology journals and theoretical ecology journals. Findings We have shown that soil ecology is not well represented in generalist ecology journals and that soil ecologists poorly use modelling and evolutionary approaches. Moreover, the articles published by a typical soil ecology journal (Soil Biology and Biochemistry) are cited by and cite low percentages of articles published in generalist ecology journals, evolutionary ecology journals and theoretical ecology journals. Conclusion This confirms our hypotheses and suggests that soil ecology would benefit from an effort towards modelling and evolutionary approaches. This effort should promote the building of a general conceptual framework for soil ecology and bridges between soil ecology and general ecology. We give some historical reasons for the parsimonious use of modelling and evolutionary approaches by soil ecologists. We finally suggest that a publication system that classifies journals according to their Impact Factors and their level of generality is probably inadequate to integrate “particularity” (empirical observations) and “generality” (general theories), which is the goal of all natural sciences. Such a system might also be particularly detrimental to the development of a science such as ecology that is intrinsically multidisciplinary."

Aside from dominant-negative behavior, there is limited evidence for cooperative functional interaction within the NKCC dimers, although it has been proposed that the proportion of disulfide-stabilized KCC2 dimer is correlated with function during neuronal development (12Blaesse P.

Yellow and cyan derivatives of green fluorescent protein (YFP and CFP) have been widely used as a biological sensor pair because they are well suited as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) partners and can be genetically encoded as fusion proteins tags for a wide variety of biological molecules. FRET between CFP and YFP has been employed in numerous investigations of subunit-subunit interactions in membrane proteins (14Zheng J. Trudeau M.C. Zagotta W.N.

In addition, engineered CFP-YFP-containing proteins are able to signal changes in intracellular [Ca2+] or [Cl-] within the cell through conformational alterations in FRET distances or, in the case of Cl-, through intrinsic properties of YFP. In this paper we report the first utilization of the CFP-YFP pair to tag NKCC1 in a study of structure and function of the transport protein. We find that there is significant intermolecular FRET between NKCC1 molecules, clearly demonstrating homomultimeric association of the functioning transporter units. A FRET pair with YFP in the N terminus between the phosphoregulatory domain and the transmembrane domain and with CFP in the C terminus exhibits a high level of FRET which changes on transporter phosphorylation. On the other hand, FRET changes were not observed when the fluorescent protein (FP) was attached at the initial residue in the flexible N terminus. Substantial changes in intramolecular and intermolecular FRET occurred cotemporaneous with changes in cell volume, indicative of a more condensed FP-NKCC structure possibly due to increased macromolecular crowding. cDNA Constructs—Fig. 1 (below) illustrates the shark NKCC1 constructs as well as the shorthand notation we use here to describe these constructs. The shark cotransporter is functionally nearly identical to the human cotransporter with somewhat different ion affinities; it offers the advantage of availability of excellent antibodies. As shown, CFP and YFP, abbreviated C and Y respectively, were added to NKCC1 at the extreme N terminus (C-NKCC and Y-NKCC) or in the N terminus near the membrane (0.83Y′-NKCC) and within a loop in the C terminus (NKCC-C and NKCC-Y); in “double” constructs two FPs were added in the N and C termini (C-NKCC-Y, Y-NKCC-C, and 0.83Y′-NKCC-C′). We also used a Cl--insensitive Q69M mutant of YFP (19Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), denoted here as Y*, and in some experiments the A206K “monomeric” mutants (20Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar) of CFP and Y*FP, denoted here C′ or Y′, respectively. Enhanced CFP and YFP vectors (pECFP-N1 and pEYFP-N1) were purchased from Clontech. Restriction sites were added to shark NKCC1 by the Kunkel method of site-directed mutagenesis as previously described (1Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) using primers shown in supplemental Table 1. FPs were cloned into NheI/BsrGI sites, which were added at the N terminus, and into AgeI/BsrGI sites added in the middle of the C terminus. Original constructs were generated in the pTZ vector and moved to pJB20, pcDNA3.1-hygro+ (Invitrogen), and pIRESpuro3 (Clontech) for co-expression with separate antibiotic resistances. Dual CFP/YFP constructs were generated by subcloning. Q69M-YFP (citrine, Y*) (19Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar) were generated by the QuikChange method (Stratagene). An NKCC with Y′FP inserted in the N terminus near the membrane domain (0.83Y′-NKCC) was prepared by generating BsiWI and AvrII sites in a single QuikChange operation (at Pro226 and Gly230, respectively) in shark NKCC1 in pJB followed by insertion of Y′FP obtained by PCR of NKCC-Y′ (this Y′FP has an unintentional but apparently not deleterious D76G mutation). The sequence surrounding the insertion site is P226VR(Y′FP)DEDLG230. A cotransfected line was obtained by transfecting NKCC-C′ (hygro) with 0.83Y′-NKCC (neo). The doubly labeled 0.83Y′-NKCC-C′ was prepared from 0.83Y′-NKCC and NKCC-C′ by subcloning of BstEII-BspEI fragments. HEK Cell Expression, Analysis of Cells—Maintenance of HEK-293 cells and generation of stable cell lines have been previously described (1Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol.

Individual colonies were screened for expression of FP-tagged NKCC1 by 86Rb influxes, Western blot analysis, and fluorescence. Media were supplemented with appropriate selective antibiotics: 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), 100 mg/ml hygromycin (American Bioanalytical), or 1 μg/ml puromycin (Clontech). Stable cell lines are named after the constructs they express. Cotransfectants are identified by a “+” between the two expressed constructs (e.g. C-NKCC+Y*-NKCC is a line coexpressing both C-NKCC and Y*-NKCC under different antibiotic resistances). In some experiments we also investigated the properties of hslo K+-channels tagged with CFP and YFP, obtained as a gift from Giraldez and Sigworth (21Giraldez T. Hughes T.E. Sigworth F.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We transfected HEK cells and isolated a stable line coexpressing hslo-667-CFP and hslo-904-YFP as well as a cotransfectant of hslo-667-CFP with NKCC-C′. 86Rb uptake fluxes were carried out as previously described in an automated 96-well plate robotic assay (1Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Two-min influxes were performed in basic medium (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm Na2SO4, and 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and 0.2–1 μCi of 86Rb/ml with Rb+ substituting K+. NKCC1 was activated by 60 min of preincubation in solutions of various composition to lower the intracellular Cl- concentration; 86Rb influxes are >90% inhibitable by bumetanide (1Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Determination of the degree of phosphorylation of the phosphoregulatory domain of NKCC1 by Western blotting and immunofluorescence of semi-thin sections were carried out as previously described (1Darman R.B.

A and B, 86Rb influx in FP-tagged NKCC1 cell lines. A, 86Rb influx was determined in a 1- or 2-min flux assay after 1 h of preincubation of the cells in media containing various concentrations of [Cl-]. Furosemide was used in some preincubation conditions to block transporter-mediated Cl- movements; furosemide quickly dissociates before the flux assay. All cells were confluent on the 96-well plates and, thus, were of similar protein concentration. The basic results have been repeated in more than 20 experiments, as we used flux assays to identify individual cell lines. A and B present results from different sets of experiments with different lines as labeled; A is from a 2-min influx assay and presents the results relative to wild type NKCC1, whereas B is from a 1-min influx assay and presents 86Rb influx per individual well.

Before solubilization in 1% Triton with phosphatase inhibitors, cells were incubated for 15 min with control (regular medium + 50 mm K+)(a), low Cl- hypotonic medium which stimulates NKCC1 (b), and calyculin A to bring about maximal phosphorylation (c).

The cells were rinsed off the dish, washed, and resuspended in 1 ml of basic medium or basic medium 2-fold-diluted, both supplemented with 5 mm glucose. The cell concentration of different cell lines was adjusted by taking optical density readings at 540 nm. Fluorescence was measured in suspension in a stirred cuvette thermostatted to 22 °C (or 25 °C, Fig. 7). Approximately 200 μl of cell suspension (∼5 × 107 cells) was used per fluorescence experiment, giving an optical density of 0.1–0.4 in the 2 ml of solution in the cuvette. Cells were held on ice for 1–4 h and pre-equilibrated at room temperature for 2–15 min immediately before the experiment. To activate the cotransporter, aliquots of cells were preincubated in low Cl- hypotonic medium (basic medium, but with gluconate replacing all but 3 mm Cl-, diluted 2-fold with water) for 30–60 min at room temperature. In experiments involving osmolyte additions, 200 μl of cell suspension was separated into aliquots into 2-fold diluted basic medium in the cuvette, with a 200-s equilibration before other additions. We also carried out experiments with cells grown on polylysine-coated 11 × 22-mm coverslips (Thomas). These were taken directly from culture medium and placed at a 28° angle to the illuminating beam in a modified plastic cuvette, over a stirring bar. Essentially identical results were obtained as with cells in suspension, both with regard to volume-dependent changes in NY′CC′ and phosphorylation-dependent changes in 0.83Y′-NKCC-C′. The coverslip method guaranteed the freshest cells and gave lower noise in FRET measurements at some cost in reproducibility in the number of cells from one coverslip to another. Fluorescence time courses and spectra were acquired on a Fluoromax 3 fluorometer (Jobin Yvon), with excitation and emission slits at 10 nm. For CFP excitation and emission the monochromators were set to 420 and 475 nm, respectively; for YFP excitation and emission the settings were 488 and 525 nm. To measure FRET, the excitation wavelength for CFP and the emission wavelength for YFP were used. To reduce the effect of monochromator bleed-through of light scattered from the cell suspension, polarizers were used in the excitation (0°) and emission beams (90°). Fluorescence lifetime data were recorded on a Photon Technology International fluorometer (Lawrence, NJ) under the same conditions as in the cuvette experiments. Data were fit to a monoexponential decay after convolution with the instrument response function (CFS-LS software; Michael L. Johnson, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). The nomenclature used for fluorescent signals is as follows: CC, total fluorescence seen in the donor channel (CFP excitation and CFP emission wavelength); CY, total fluorescence seen in the FRET channel (CFP excitation and YFP emission wavelength);YY, total fluorescence seen in the acceptor channel (YFP excitation and YFP emission wavelength). To correct for autofluorescence of cells, background effects of added reagents, and residual light scatter, experiments were performed twice, once with cells expressing fluorescent proteins and once with an equal amount of HEK cells expressing untagged NKCC1; the latter readings were then subtracted from those with fluorescently tagged NKCC. The spectral bleed-through for our experimental setup was bc = CY/CC = 0.43 ± 0.02 (n = 25 experiments on 8 different days with CFP-tagged NKCCs) and by = CY/YY = 0.02 ± 0.005 (n = 26 experiments on 7 different days with YFP-tagged NKCCs). There was no significant difference in bc or by between cell lines with FPs in the N terminus or C terminus. Then corrected FRET emission is, FRET=CY-CC·bc-YY·by(Eq. 1) In Fig. 5A FRET efficiency (E) is calculated from fluorometric data as α·FRET/(CC+α·FRET), where α is a constant instrumental factor derived from fluorescence lifetime measurements of FRET efficiency and the corresponding fluorometric values (see supplemental Methods 1). To eliminate effects of changes in YFP fluorescence efficiency during experimental changes, we normalize FRET by YFP fluorescence (14Zheng J. Trudeau M.C. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 2002; 36: 891-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), FRETnorm=FRET/YY(Eq. 2) To compare FRET values in different cell lines with different ratios of CFP- and YFP-tagged cotransporters, we consider that NKCC1 forms dimers. 4Available evidence favors NKCC dimers (9Starremans P.G.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3718-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Higher oligomers will also follow these equations at low FRET efficiencies, in which case total FRET is made up of the sum of the FRET values for every potential conjugate pair, each of which is described by the same mole fraction relationship. Because FRETnorm expresses the amount of FRET per YFP, we ask the probability of finding a CFP with a given YFP in a dimer, assuming all transporters form dimers. This is simply given by the amount of CFP as the fraction of total FP, fc = R/(1 + R), where R = CFP/YFP, the calculation of which is presented in the supplemental Methods 1. We then calculate an interaction value (IFRET) that adjusts for the amount of expected dimer formation: IFRET=FRETnormfc(Eq. 3) In the experiment shown in Fig. 6 (below) we isolated cotransfected cell lines and picked lines with different amounts of wild type NKCC1 (wt) and Y*-NKCC-C (doub). Assuming transporters form dimers, 4Available evidence favors NKCC dimers (9Starremans P.G. Kersten F.F. Van Den Heuvel L.P. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc.

Higher oligomers will also follow these equations at low FRET efficiencies, in which case total FRET is made up of the sum of the FRET values for every potential conjugate pair, each of which is described by the same mole fraction relationship. the probability for a pairing of Y*-NKCC-C in these lines is given by (doub/(wt + doub))2, and the equation we fit in Fig. 6D is FRETnorm=FRETnormmonomer+FRETnormdimer·11+wt/doub2(Eq. 4) Intracellular chloride was estimated from the fluorescence yield of YFP in cell lines expressing C-NKCC-Y (CFP and chloride sensitive YFP). Because CFP is chloride-insensitive, the ratio YY/CTOT (where CTOT is the CFP fluorescence in the absence of FRET, see supplemental Methods 1) is a measure of changes in intracellular chloride concentration provided pH is controlled or measured. Intracellular pH in HEK cells has been reported to increase only 0.08 pH units on shrinkage in 200 mm sucrose (24Salvi A. Quillan J.M. Sadee W. AAPS PharmSci. 2002; 4: E21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and less than 0.1 pH unit on removal of extracellular Cl- (25Kim K.H. Shcheynikov N. Wang Y. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6463-6470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We used scattered light as an empirical indicator of cell volume changes. Scattered light was measured in the Fluoromax 3 with excitation and emission monochromators set to 540 nm and with 1-nm slit, under the same conditions as in the fluorescence experiments. As presented, light scatter data were not corrected for dilution of the cells upon addition of solutes. FP Constructs of NKCC1—With an aim to generate functional probes of NKCC function, we inserted CFP and YFP at the N terminus of shark NKCC1 and also within the large cytoplasmic C terminus. The N terminus of the cation-chloride cotransporters is poorly conserved, varies in length among species and isoforms, is insensitive to partial truncation (26Darman R.B. Flemmer A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34359-34362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and tolerates the addition of various epitope tags without change of function. The entire region (residues 1–246 in shark NKCC1), with the exception of the SPAK binding domain (residues 40–48), the PP1 binding domain (residues 108–113), and the phosphorylation domain (residues 167–209), has very high indices of predicted disorder using PONDR (27Obradovic Z. Peng K. Vucetic S. Radivojac P. Dunker A.K. Proteins. 2005; 61: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and DisEMBL (28Iakoucheva L.M. Dunker A.K. Structure. 2003; 11: 1316-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 5B. Forbush, unpublished information. We added FP tags both at the extreme N terminus (Y-NKCC, C-NKCC) and near the first transmembrane domain (0.83Y′-NKCC, Fig. 1). These were studied in two major series of experiments, the 0.83Y′-NKCC experiments being carried out subsequent to completion of most of the work with N-terminal constructs. In contrast to the N terminus of NKCC, much of the C terminus is tightly conserved, and functional insertion of tags at the extreme C terminus has been unsuccessful. 6C. M. Gillen, P. Isenring, R. B. Darman, I. Gimenez, and B. Forbush, unpublished information. Thus, we attempted insertion of FPs in a region of the C terminus that is locally very poorly conserved among NKCCs, is absent in KCCs, and has a high degree of predicted disorder using PONDR (27O"
https://openalex.org/W1965052190,"Ligand binding induces shape changes within the four modular ectodomains (D1-D4) of the CD4 receptor, an important receptor in immune signaling. Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) on both a two-domain and a four-domain construct of the soluble CD4 (sCD4) is consistent with known crystal structures demonstrating a bilobal and a semi-extended tetralobal Z conformation in solution, respectively. Detection of conformational changes within sCD4 as a result of ligand binding was followed by SAXS on sCD4 bound to two different glycoprotein ligands: the tick saliva immunosuppressor Salp15 and the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120. Ab initio modeling of these data showed that both Salp15 and gp120 bind to the D1 domain of sCD4 and yet induce drastically different structural rearrangements. Upon binding, Salp15 primarily distorts the characteristic lobal architecture of the sCD4 without significantly altering the semi-extended shape of the sCD4 receptor. In sharp contrast, the interaction of gp120 with sCD4 induces a shape change within sCD4 that can be described as a Z-to-U bi-fold closure of the four domains across its flexible D2-D3 linker. Placement of known crystal structures within the boundaries of the SAXS-derived models suggests that the ligand-induced shape changes could be a result of conformational changes within this D2-D3 linker. Functionally, the observed shape changes in CD4 receptor causes dissociation of lymphocyte kinase from the cytoplasmic domain of Salp15-bound CD4 and facilitates an interaction between the exposed V3 loops of CD4-bound gp120 molecule to the extracellular loops of its co-receptor, a step essential for HIV-1 viral entry."
https://openalex.org/W2062058981,"Sporulation is a complex developmental system characterizing Gram-positive bacteria of the genus Bacillus and Clostridium. In Bacillus subtilis the phosphorelay signal transduction system regulates the initiation of sporulation by integrating a myriad of positive and negative signals through the action of histidine sensor kinases and aspartyl phosphate phosphatases. The Spo0E family of phosphatases dephosphorylates the Spo0A response regulator and transcription factor of the phosphorelay. In this study we analyzed the role of the Spo0E signature motif in protein activity. This family is characterized by a conserved signature motif centered around the sequence “SQELD.” Alanine scanning mutagenesis was carried out on the T35IXXSQ ELDCLI46 residues of B. subtilis Spo0E and in vivo and in vitro activities were analyzed. The ability of the mutant proteins to interact with Spo0A∼P was assayed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy. The results suggested that aspartate 43 has a critical role in Spo0E catalytic activity, whereas the other residues have a role in protein conformation and/or interaction with Spo0A. Residues Thr35 and Cys44 did not seem to have any critical functional or structural role. We propose that Asp43 of Spo0E may function in a manner similar to the one proposed for the catalytic mechanisms of nucleotidase members of the haloacid dehalogenase family. These proteins use an aspartyl nucleophile as their common catalytic strategy and the active site of haloacid dehalogenase proteins shares a common geometry and identity of conserved amino acids with the active site of response regulators (Ridder, I. S., and Dijkstra, B. W. (1999) Biochem. J. 339, 223-226). Sporulation is a complex developmental system characterizing Gram-positive bacteria of the genus Bacillus and Clostridium. In Bacillus subtilis the phosphorelay signal transduction system regulates the initiation of sporulation by integrating a myriad of positive and negative signals through the action of histidine sensor kinases and aspartyl phosphate phosphatases. The Spo0E family of phosphatases dephosphorylates the Spo0A response regulator and transcription factor of the phosphorelay. In this study we analyzed the role of the Spo0E signature motif in protein activity. This family is characterized by a conserved signature motif centered around the sequence “SQELD.” Alanine scanning mutagenesis was carried out on the T35IXXSQ ELDCLI46 residues of B. subtilis Spo0E and in vivo and in vitro activities were analyzed. The ability of the mutant proteins to interact with Spo0A∼P was assayed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy. The results suggested that aspartate 43 has a critical role in Spo0E catalytic activity, whereas the other residues have a role in protein conformation and/or interaction with Spo0A. Residues Thr35 and Cys44 did not seem to have any critical functional or structural role. We propose that Asp43 of Spo0E may function in a manner similar to the one proposed for the catalytic mechanisms of nucleotidase members of the haloacid dehalogenase family. These proteins use an aspartyl nucleophile as their common catalytic strategy and the active site of haloacid dehalogenase proteins shares a common geometry and identity of conserved amino acids with the active site of response regulators (Ridder, I. S., and Dijkstra, B. W. (1999) Biochem. J. 339, 223-226). Sporulation is a complex development system that characterizes Gram-positive organisms of the genus Bacillus. The mechanism regulating spore formation has been studied in great detail in Bacillus subtilis, thanks to its amenability to genetic manipulation, but many aspects are applicable to other species or even Genus such as Bacillus anthracis and Clostridia (1Stephenson K. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Paredes C.J. Alsaker K.V. Papoutsakis E.T. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The initial step of the sporulation process is regulated by the phosphorelay, a multicomponent signal transduction system of the two-component family (3Perego M. Hoch J.A. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Its Closest Relatives: From Genes to Cells. ASM Press, Washington, DC2002: 473-481Google Scholar, 4Piggot P.J. Hilbert D.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In the phosphorelay, activating signals are integrated by 5 histidine sensor kinases (KinA, -B, -C, -D, and -E) whose autophosphorylation on a histidine residue is followed by a transfer of the phosphoryl group to an aspartate residue of the single domain response regulator intermediate Spo0F. From Spo0F, the phosphoryl group is relayed to the Spo0A response regulator through a phosphohistidine of the phosphotransferase Spo0B (Fig. 1) (5Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A.

Shao W. Perego M. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Modulation of the phosphorelay system is a critical aspect of Bacillus physiology because it is relevant to the persistence of the organism in the environment or, in the case of pathogenic organisms, in the host (9Errington J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Modulation of the system may occur at different levels by means of positive and negative effectors. Activating signals sensed by the kinases are essential but their identification has so far proved elusive. Nevertheless, the identification of negative regulators of the main sporulation kinase, KinA, and additional experimental evidence indicate that the cell cycle, metabolism, and environmental conditions influence the activity of the histidine kinases (10Wang L. Grau R. Perego M. Hoch J.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2569-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11Burkholder W.F. Kurtser I. Grossman A.D. Cell. 2001; 104: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Fundamental to proper physiological signal transduction are negative regulatory mechanisms that allow the cell to rapidly respond to changes in environmental or growth conditions. In the sporulation phosphorelay, the Spo0F response regulator is subject to negative regulation by members of the Rap family of phosphatases (RapA, -B, -E, and -H) in response to signals that induce pathways alternative to sporulation, such as growth or competence to DNA transformation (12Perego M.

Microbiol. 2007; 65: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An additional negative regulatory mechanism is exerted specifically on the Spo0A protein by the three members of the Spo0E family of phosphatases (Spo0E, YisI, and YnzD). Members of this family were previously shown to be small proteins (ranging between 56 and 85 amino acids) that shared a consensus motif, SQELD, generally preceded by a hydrophobic residue (located two amino acids upstream) and followed by two hydrophobic residues (located one amino acid downstream). A threonine residue immediately preceding the first hydrophobic residue is also invariant in the B. subtilis Spo0E proteins and highly conserved in the Spo0E-like proteins of other Bacilli (Fig. 2A) (15Perego M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The structures of two Spo0E-like proteins of B. anthracis (BA1655 and BA5174) have been solved by NMR spectroscopy. Each is organized in two anti-parallel α-helices with the conserved signature motif SQELD (SRDLD in BA1655) located in the middle of helix α2. Notably the residues of the signature motif corresponding to glutamine 40 and aspartate 43 in B. subtilis Spo0E have their side chains projecting outwards from the protein surface with neither forming intramolecular interactions (16Grenha R. Rzechorzek N. Brannigan J.A. de Jong R.N. AB E. Diercks T. Bouvin A. Truffault V. Ladds J.C. Fogg M.J. Perego M. Kaptein R. Wilson K.S. Folkers G.E. Wilkinson A.J. J. Biol.

In this study, alanine mutagenesis was carried out on the signature motif of B. subtilis Spo0E to determine whether any of its residues had critical roles in the phosphatase activity. In addition to genetic and biochemical studies, these mutants were analyzed in vitro by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 2The abbreviations used are: FRETfluorescence resonance energy transferEPPS4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acidHADhaloacid dehalogenaseDTTdithiothreitolTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. spectroscopy to gain information on the interaction of Spo0E with Spo0A. fluorescence resonance energy transfer 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid haloacid dehalogenase dithiothreitol N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The B. subtilis strain JH12745 (trpC2, phe-1, spo0E::cat) (17Perego M. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2514-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used throughout this study. B. subtilis strains were grown in Schaeffer sporulation medium (18Schaeffer P. Millet J. Aubert J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) supplemented with erythromycin (5 μg/ml). Escherichia coli DH5α was used for plasmid construction and propagation. Strains were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or kanamycin (30 μg/ml). Sporulation assays were carried out in 5 ml of Schaeffer medium at 37 °C for the times indicated in Table 1. Serial dilutions were plated in duplicate before and after treatment with 0.5 ml of CHCl3. Colony counts were averaged and the percentage of sporulation was calculated as the ratio between the survival and the viable counts.TABLE 1Efficiency of sporulation of strain JH12745 overexpressing the wild type and mutant Spo0E proteins StrainaRepresentative of two independent experiments.

Cells were grown for 30 h at 37 °C in Schaeffer's sporulation medium containing 5 μg/ml erythromycin. Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis of the spo0E Gene—Site-directed mutagenesis of the spo0E gene was carried out by Kunkel's method (19Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) using the Muta-Gene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). The spo0E gene (181 bp of promoter region and 258 bp of coding sequence) was PCR amplified from chromosomal DNA of wild type strain JH642 using oligonucleotide primers OE5′SophPst and OE3′SophBam (supplemental Table 1S). The fragment was digested with PstI and BamHI, and ligated into similarly digested vector pTZ19U (Bio-Rad). The resulting plasmid, pTZ19U-0E, was used to generate the spo0E mutant genes according to the mutagenesis kit instructions (Bio-Rad). After verification by DNA sequencing, the wild type and mutated spo0E genes were then transferred as PstI-BamHI fragments to the multicopy pHT315 vector for genetic analyses (20Arantes O. Lereclus D. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—The wild type and mutant spo0E coding sequences were PCR amplified from the pTZ19U-0E plasmids using oligonucleotide primers Spo0E5′Nco and Spo0E3′Xho (supplemental materials Table 1S) and cloned in the pET28α expression vector (Novagen) thus generating a fusion to six histidine codons at the 3′ end of the gene. The E. coli expression strain BL21(DE3) pLysS was freshly transformed with the pET28-spo0E wild type or mutant plasmids and single colonies were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing kanamycin to an A600 of 0.6-0.8. The cultures were then induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated for an additional 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellets were frozen until use. The Spo0E proteins were purified essentially as previously described (21Stephenson S. Perego M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1455-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The Spo0A protein (modified to carry a His6 tag at the carboxyl terminal end) and its phosphorylated form (Spo0A∼P) were also purified as previously described (21Stephenson S. Perego M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1455-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation Assay—Spo0A (5 μm) was phosphorylated in a reaction containing KinA (0.1 μm), Spo0F (2.5 μm), and Spo0B (0.1 μm) in the phosphorelay buffer (50 mm EPPS, pH 8.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol [γ-32P]ATP (at 1.86 μCi/μl final concentration) and 900 μm ATP (22Grimshaw C.E. Huang S. Hanstein C.G. Strauch M.A. Burbulys D. Wang L. Hoch J.A. Whiteley J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated for 45 min at room temperature. The Spo0E proteins were then added (5 μm) and aliquots were withdrawn at intervals as indicated in Fig. 6. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-loading buffer and immediate freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath. Samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by PhosphorImager quantitation by the ImageQuant Software (Molecular Dynamics). Dephosphorylation assays using purified Spo0A∼P were carried out as described previously (21Stephenson S. Perego M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1455-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Tris-Tricine native PAGE was carried out according to Schagger and von Jagow (23Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The gels were prepared with 3 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.45, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The running buffer was 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m Tricine, pH 8.25. Protein molecular weights were determined using molecular weight markers for non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (Sigma) as standards. Calculations were carried out as described in the supplier's instructions. Size Exclusion Chromatography—A 200-ml Sephacryl S-100 column (120 × 1.5 cm) was equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl). Approximately 10 mg of purified Spo0E protein in buffer A containing 5% glycerol was applied to the column. The elution was followed by reading at OD280 and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The molecular weights were determined based on the calibration curve obtained with the molecular weight standards. Construction, Expression, and Activity of N-Spo0A Cys Mutants—Site-directed mutagenesis of the NH2 terminus of Spo0A from B. subtilis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmid pET28α (Novagen) carrying the N-spo0A gene was used as template for the PCR. The N-spo0A gene, which encodes the amino-terminal domain of Spo0A (amino acids 1-128), was PCR amplified using the oligonucleotide primers Spo0A5′Nco and Spo0A3′Xho (supplemental Table 1S). Two single mutants, C7S and C42S, were created using oligonucleotide pairs Spo0AC7S-Spo0AC7Srev and Spo0AC42S-Spo0AC42Srev (supplemental Table 1S). The cysteine mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) grown at 37 °C in LB medium. The protein purification was carried out in 50 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole (Buffer A) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were disrupted by sonication on ice and His6 tag N-Spo0A mutant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA resin column (Qiagen) chromatography as described for the wild type protein (21Stephenson S. Perego M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1455-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation activity of N-Spo0AC7S or N-Spo0AC42S were tested as described above. Fluorescent Labeling—The Spo0A and Spo0E proteins were first incubated overnight in their storage buffer supplemented with 1 mm DTT. The DTT was removed prior to the incubation with the Alexa Fluor molecules by using a NAP5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7 (for Spo0A) or pH 8 (for Spo0E). The proteins were eluted in the same sodium phosphate buffer and concentrated with a Microcon column (Amicon). To completely remove the DTT, the proteins were diluted 20-fold in sodium phosphate buffer and concentrated again. Labeling of N-Spo0A proteins or Spo0E proteins with the maleimide derivative of Alexa Fluor 488 and 555 (Molecular Probes), respectively, was carried out by reacting the proteins with a 3-fold molar excess of dye for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Unreacted dye was removed by gel-filtration through Sephadex G-25. Labeled protein was separated from unlabeled material by an octyl-Sepharose CL-4B column equilibrated with sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7 or 8) containing 1.5 m (NH4)SO4. The protein was then eluted using a step gradient of sodium phosphate buffer containing (NH4)SO4 at 1, 0.5, and 0 m. Labeled protein concentrations were estimated by absorption spectroscopy using the following extinction coefficients for the conjugated dyes: N-Spo0AC42S-Alexa488 or N-Spo0AC7S-Alexa488, 72,000 m-1 cm-1 at 496 nm; Spo0E-Alexa 555, 158,000 m-1 cm-1 at 556 nm. FRET Measurements—FRET efficiencies were determined from steady-state fluorescence. Fluorescence emission spectra were taken on an SLM Aminco 8100 spectrofluorometer. Emission spectra of donor (N-Spo0AC42S-Alexa488 or N-Spo0AC7S-Alexa488), both in the presence and absence of the acceptor (Spo0E-Alexa 555), were recorded over the wavelength range of 470-520 nm with a spectral band-pass of 8 nm. Samples were temperature controlled at 20 °C. FRET efficiencies were calculated with the formula E = 1 - IDA/ID, in which I is the intensity of the signal in the presence of the donor only (D) or the donor and acceptor (DA). Binding Assay—All measurements were carried out using 40 nm unphosphorylated or phosphorylated N-Spo0AC42S-Alexa488 or N-Spo0AC7S-Alexa488 in 1 × phosphorelay buffer, pH 8.5, unless otherwise stated. The concentrations of the Spo0E-Alexa 555 used are given in Fig. 7, E and F. Analysis of Steady-state Fluorescence Titrations—We considered a simple model in which the interaction between N-Spo0A and Spo0E can be treated as a simple 1:1 association, with an apparent equilibrium constant given by: Kapp = [DA]/[D][A]. In this equation [DA] is the equilibrium concentration of the N-Spo0AC42S-Spo0E complex, whereas [D] and [A] are the equilibrium concentrations of free N-Spo0AC42S and Spo0E, respectively (24Bailey M.F. van der Schans E.J. Millar D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 673-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Antibody Production—A polyclonal antibody against Spo0E was obtained by standard procedures after immunization of a rabbit with the purified protein. Docking Calculations—Protein docking calculations were performed with HADDOCK 2.0 (25Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar) using standard protocols. The NMR structure of BA5174 (Protein Data Bank code 2C0S) and one of the four subunits of the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure of Spo0A∼P (PDB code 1QMP) were docked. The Ca2+ ion in the active site of Spo0A∼P structure was replaced with a Mg2+ ion and water molecules were omitted from the calculations. The topology parameters for the phosphorylated aspartate in the Spo0A∼P structure were obtained using the Dundee PRODRG server (26Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar). Six amino acid residues of Spo0A∼P (Asp9, Asp10, Asn11, Asp55, Thr84, Lys106) and three amino acid residues of BA5174 (Ser35, Gln36, Asp39) were considered as potential sources of ambiguous interaction restraints in the docking calculations. The solvent accessibility of these residues was calculated, and those that are exposed at the surface were further selected for ambiguous interaction restraints (ACS). The solutions from the docking calculations were ranked according to their average interaction energies (sum of Eelec, Evdw, EACS) and their average buried surface area (25Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). Phenotypic Analysis of Spo0E Mutants—With the objective of measuring the contribution of the conserved signature sequence of the Spo0E family of proteins to their phosphatase activity, we carried out alanine scanning mutagenesis of these residues in B. subtilis Spo0E. Residues Thr35, Ile36, Ser39, Gln40, Glu41, Leu42, Asp43, Cys44, Leu45, and Ile46 were singly mutated to alanine by means of the single-stranded site-directed mutagenesis method (19Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each allele was cloned in the multicopy shuttle vector pHT315 (20Arantes O. Lereclus D. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and transformed into the B. subtilis spo0E mutant strain JH12745 (17Perego M. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2514-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because overexpression of the wild type spo0E gene results in inhibition of sporulation, any alanine substitution affecting the activity of the Spo0E mutant proteins would result in a less drastic sporulation defect. Liquid sporulation assays were carried out to quantitate the in vivo activity of the Spo0E mutant proteins compared with the wild type. The results shown in Table 1 indicated that whereas alanine substitution at residues Thr35, Glu41, and Cys44 did not affect the activity of the Spo0E protein, the remaining mutant proteins were significantly affected in their ability to inhibit sporulation. These observations suggested a significant role in the structure and/or function of Spo0E for Ile36, Ser39, Gln40, Leu42, Asp43, Leu45, and Ile46. Biochemical Analysis of the Spo0E Mutants—Because the Spo0E protein inhibits sporulation when overexpressed by dephosphorylating the Spo0A∼P response regulator, we purified the wild type and Spo0E mutant proteins to quantitate their activity in an in vitro assay. COOH-terminal His6 tag derivative proteins were purified from overexpressing E. coli strains as described under “Experimental Procedures” and their activity was tested against purified phosphorylated Spo0A protein. The time course of Spo0E-dependent dephosphorylation and autodephosphorylation of Spo0A∼P were monitored and the results are shown in Fig. 3. In agreement with the in vivo analysis, the T35A and C44A mutant proteins were not affected in their dephosphorylation activity toward Spo0A∼P. Also in agreement with the in vivo data were the observation that the Q40A mutant protein was slightly affected showing a 4-min delay in reducing the amount of Spo0A∼P to its basal level. Under the assay conditions used, dephosphorylation of Spo0A∼P by the E41A mutant protein was also delayed compared with the wild type protein, even though in vivo it seemed to have wild type activity. The I36A, I46A, and S39A proteins were ∼50% less active than the wild type, whereas the L42A protein was slightly less active than the wild type. The D43A protein was essentially inactive in agreement with the lack of activity in vivo. The in vitro activity did not seem to correlate with the in vivo activity only for the Spo0E L45A mutant that, although affected in vivo, was as active as the wild type in vitro. Western Blot Analysis—To determine whether the in vivo activities of the mutant proteins were affected by protein instability, immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates of strains expressing the Spo0E mutant proteins were carried out. The results (shown by a representative gel in Fig. 4) indicated that alanine substitutions at residues Thr35, Ile36, Ser39, Gln40, Leu42, and Asp43 give rise to levels of proteins comparable with that in the wild type strain, thus excluding the possibility that any observed phenotype was the result of protein instability. Variability in protein concentrations within several independent analyses is most likely attributable to the low level of Spo0E protein present in the cells and the weakness of the anti-Spo0E antibody. On the contrary, strains expressing the L45A and I46A mutant proteins consistently contained almost undetectable levels of Spo0E. Thus, whereas the substitution of Leu45 with alanine impaired the stability of the protein in vivo but not in vitro, the I46A replacement gave rise to an unstable protein in vivo and an inactive one in vitro. Oligomerization of Spo0E Wild Type and Mutant Proteins—To determine the oligomeric state of the Spo0E proteins, we carried out analyses by native gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography, and mass spectrometry. Native gel electrophoresis was carried out at four different concentrations of polyacrylamide (12, 13, 14, and 15%) with Tris-Tricine buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) in the presence of 5 mm DTT to minimize the oxidation of the cysteine residue at position 44. The results revealed that the Spo0E wild type protein separated into three major bands whose molecular masses were calculated to be 22, 48, and 66 kDa (supplemental materials Fig. S1). To obtain precise molecular weights of the Spo0E forms, analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was carried out. The wild type protein sample showed three peaks with masses of 10,728, 21,454, and 32,218 daltons, consistent with monomer, dimer, and trimer forms (supplemental materials Fig. S2). These values are also consistent with the predicted molecular weight if removal of the initial methionine is taken into account. Taking into account the possibility of a molecular size overestimation associated with the non-denaturing gel electrophoresis method, the results are consistent with a possible organization of Spo0E as monomeric, dimeric, or trimeric forms with the former being the most abundant form (Fig. 5A). All the alanine mutant proteins generated in this study showed the same oligomerization pattern as wild type Spo0E with the exception of the C44A mutant protein whose major species was the monomer with only a minor presence of the dimeric form (Fig. 5A). These data, together with the in vivo and in vitro analyses, suggest that, because the alanine substitution of the cysteine residue does not impair the dephosphorylation of Spo0A, the monomeric form of Spo0E may be sufficient for activity although a dimer can be formed even in the absence of the cysteine. The trimer form may be an artifact due to oxidation of the cysteine residue in vitro. To determine whether the oligomeric forms of the Spo0E protein were stable or interconverting, we purified the Spo0E wild type protein by gel filtration chromatography (supplemental materials Fig. S3). Standards of known molecular weights were used to estimate the size of the protein fractions. The subunit molecular weight of His tag-modified Spo0E is 10,856. By Sephacryl S-100 chromatography, the Spo0E wild type protein eluted in a first, broad peak of an estimated molecular mass of 42 kDa likely corresponding to a trimer. Two additional sharp peaks with estimated molecular masses of 28 and 14.8 kDa, corresponding to the dimer and monomer forms, respectively, also eluted from the column. When the three fractions were analyzed by native gel electrophoresis, the monomer form of the third fraction was essentially pure, whereas the dimer of the second fraction contained ∼20% of the bigger oligomer but no monomeric protein, arguing against the possibility of a rapid monomer-dimer equilibrium. The first fraction contained ∼30% of dimeric and 70% of trimeric protein (Fig. 5B). In Vitro Activity of the Spo0E Oligomers—To assess whether the oligomeric forms of Spo0E separated by gel filtration were active, we tested their ability to dephosphorylate Spo0A∼P. The results shown in Fig. 6 indicated that a rate of dephosphorylation comparable with the wild type Spo0E was reached by the purified monomeric form as well as the dimeric form, whereas the third fraction (mixture of dimer and trimer) was significantly less active. This suggests that the mo"
https://openalex.org/W2003015710,"Although ontogenetic changes in body shape and its associated allometry has been studied for over a century, essentially nothing is known about their underlying genetic and developmental mechanisms. One of the reasons for this ignorance is the unavailability of a conceptual framework to formulate the experimental design for data collection and statistical models for data analyses. We developed a framework model for unraveling the genetic machinery for ontogenetic changes of allometry. The model incorporates the mathematical aspects of ontogenetic growth and allometry into a maximum likelihood framework for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. As a quantitative platform, the model allows for the testing of a number of biologically meaningful hypotheses to explore the pleiotropic basis of the QTL that regulate ontogeny and allometry. Simulation studies and real data analysis of a live example in soybean have been performed to investigate the statistical behavior of the model and validate its practical utilization. The statistical model proposed will help to study the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes and, therefore, gain better insights into the mechanistic regulation for developmental patterns and processes in organisms."

This process involves an NADPH oxidase-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through a ceramide- and protein kinase Cζ-dependent pathway, which leads to an activating phosphorylation of p47phox. The mechanisms underlying CD95L-induced ceramide formation were addressed in the present study. It was found that CD95L lowered within seconds the apparent vesicular pH from 6.0 to 5.7 in a fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran-accessible endosomal compartment, which was previously shown to contain acidic sphingomyelinase, and decreased N-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-6-methoxyquinolinium bromide fluorescence, suggestive for an increase of cytosolic [Cl-]. Bafilomycin or 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid disodium salt largely abolished the CD95L-induced endosomal acidification, ceramide formation, and downstream events, such as p47phox phosphorylation, ROS formation, CD95 activation, and apoptosis. These responses were also abolished after knock-down of acidic sphingomyelinase in rat hepatocytes. Interestingly, caspase 8 inhibitors abolished these CD95L-induced signaling events, including the increase in cytosolic [Cl-], endosomal acidification, ceramide formation, and ROS generation as well as CD95 targeting to the plasma membrane and CD95 activation. The data suggest that CD95L initiates a rapid caspase 8-dependent endosomal acidification, which triggers ceramide-dependent ROS formation as an upstream event of trafficking of intracellularly stored CD95 to the plasma membrane.

Hyperosmotic or bile salt-triggered ceramide formation results from an endosomal acidification with subsequent activation of acidic sphingomyelinase (11Reinehr R. Becker S. Braun J. Eberle A.

The mechanisms underlying the rapid ROS response and NADPH oxidase activation after the addition of CD95L, however, remained unclear. Furthermore, in resting hepatocytes CD95 is located inside the hepatocyte, whereas CD95 immunostaining of the plasma membrane is, if at all barely detectable. This raises the question of how externally added CD95L activates intracellularly stored CD95 in hepatocytes. These questions were addressed in the present study, which shows that CD95L induces rapid endosomal acidification and ceramide formation leading to NADPH oxidase activation. The resulting ROS response in turn triggers the targeting of intracellular CD95 to the plasma membrane and DISC formation. Interestingly, all these processes were sensitive to caspase 8, but not caspase 3 inhibition, suggestive for a caspase 8-dependent autoamplification of death receptor signaling. This amplification is apparently initiated by a ligand-dependent activation of small, by conventional immunostaining undetectable amounts of CD95 receptors present in the plasma membrane whereby the resulting activation of caspase 8 triggers via endosomal acidification and ceramide formation the activation of intracellular CD95 and its recruitment to the plasma membrane. Thus, caspase 8 may not only play a role in initiating proapoptotic cascades through activation of downstream caspases but also by amplifying the amount of activated CD95 receptors.

The antibodies used were purchased as follows. Mouse anti-GAPDH antibody was from Chemicon (Billerica, MA), mouse anti-annexin II antibody was from BD Bioscience, rabbit anti-acidic sphingomyelinase (ASM), rabbit anti-p47phox, rabbit anti-CD95, rabbit anti-FADD, and mouse anti-caspase 8 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-phospho-Src family-Tyr418 antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); goat anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibody was from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany); rabbit anti-phospho-JNK1/2 antibodies were from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA); rabbit anti-Yes, sheep anti-EGFR, rabbit anti-p47phox, and mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); mouse anti-phosphoserine (clone 16B4) was from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were from Merck at the highest quality available. Cell Preparation and Culture—As described previously (1Reinehr R. Graf D. Fischer R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), hepatocytes were isolated from livers of male Wistar rats fed ad libitum with a standard diet by a collagenase perfusion technique. Aliquots of 1.5 × 106 hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated 6-well culture plates (Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany) and cultured as published recently (1Reinehr R. Graf D. Fischer R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) for 24 h unless indicated otherwise before the experiments were started. Osmolarity changes were performed by appropriate addition or removal of NaCl from the medium. The viability of the hepatocytes was more than 95% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Human hepatoma cell line 7 (Huh7) cells (14Seki S. Kitada T. Sakaguchi H. Kawada N. Iwai S. Kadoya H. Nakatani K. Med. Electron Microsc. 1999; 32: 199-203PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mix F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin resulting in a final osmolarity of 305 mosmol/liter as measured using a cryoscopic osmometer (Osmomat 030; Gonotec, Berlin, Germany). Cells were grown to 70–85% confluency before transient transfection using expression vectors of the CD95-YFP fusion protein supplemented with Lipofectamine 2000 culture medium without antibiotics. ASM Protein Knock-down—Antisense oligonucleotides directed against ASM and the corresponding controls (i.e. nonsense oligonucleotides) were designed and manufactured by Biognostik (Göttingen, Germany). Immediately after hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated culture plates (diameter, 6 cm; Falcon) at a density of 4 × 106 cells/plate, 4 μmol/liter of the respective oligonucleotides (nonsense or ASM antisense) supplemented with Lipofectamine 2000 were added according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Thereafter, cells were kept in culture for up to 4 days. In control experiments, uptake of FITC-labeled nonsense oligonucleotides (2 μmol/liter) was already visible after 1 h of incubation and lasted for up to 4 days. Western Blot Analysis—At the end of the incubations, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed briefly with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immediately lysed. Samples were transferred to PAGE, and proteins were then blotted to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry transfer apparatus (GE Healthcare) as recently described (1Reinehr R. Graf D. Fischer R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked for 2 h in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin containing 20 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with the first antibody (antibodies used were anti-phosphoserine (1:1250), anti-phospho-Src family-Tyr418 and anti-Yes (1:2500), anti-annexin II and anti-phospho-JNK1/2 (1:5000), anti-GAPDH, anti-EGFR, anti-CD95, anti-FADD, anti-caspase 8, and anti-phosphotyrosine (1:10,000)). After washing with TBS-T and incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse, anti-sheep or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (all diluted 1:10,000) at room temperature for 2 h, respectively, the blots were washed extensively and developed using enhanced chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat AR-5 film. Immunoprecipitation—Hepatocytes were harvested in lysis buffer as recently published (1Reinehr R. Graf D. Fischer R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Equal protein amounts (200 μg) of each sample were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with a polyclonal rabbit anti-CD95, rabbit anti-EGFR, rabbit anti-p47phox, or rabbit anti-Yes antibody (dilution 1:100; Santa Cruz, CA) to immunoprecipitate CD95, EGFR, p47phox, or Yes. Then 10 μl of protein A- and 10 μl of protein-G-agarose (Santa Cruz) were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times as published recently (2Reinehr R. Schliess F. Häussinger D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 731-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and then transferred to Western blot analysis as described above. Activation of p47phox by serine phosphorylation was detected using an anti-phosphoserine antibody (15Bataller R. Schwabe R.F. Choi Y.H. Yang L. Paik Y.H. Lindquist J. Qian T. Schoonhoven R. Hagedorn C.H. Lemasters J.J. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The anti-phospho-Src family-Tyr418 antibody was used to detect activating phosphorylation of Yes (16Piiper A. Elez R. You S.J. Kronenberger B. Loitsch S. Roche S. Zeuzem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7065-7072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was used to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in the respective immunoprecipitates. FADD and caspase 8 association or tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated CD95 samples were detected by Western blot analysis using the respective antibodies (anti-FADD, anti-caspase 8, and anti-phosphotyrosine). Detection of ROS—Hepatocytes were seeded on collagen-coated 6-well culture plates (Falcon) and cultured for 24 h. Cells were incubated with PBS containing 5 μmol/liter CM-H2DCFDA for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. To detect ROS generation, CM-H2DCFDA-loaded cells were supplemented again with culture medium and then exposed to CD95L for the indicated time period. Then cells were washed briefly using ice-cold PBS, and cells were lysed in 0.1% Triton X 100 (v/v) dissolved in aqua bidest. Lysates were centrifuged immediately (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 min), and fluorescence of the supernatant was measured at 515–565 nm using a luminescence spectrometer LS-5B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a 488-nm excitation wavelength. Fluorescence of untreated control cells was arbitrarily set to 1. Determination of Apparent Endosomal pH (pHves) and Intracellular Cl- Concentration by Single Cell Fluorescence Recording—To determine changes in apparent vesicular pH (pHves), primary hepatocytes grown for 24 h on glass coverslips (diameter, 30 mm) were washed with PBS and then incubated in the same solution with FITC-dextran (5 mg/ml) for another 60 min at 37 °C. The intracellular vesicular compartment reached by FITC-dextran under these conditions is seen to reflect an endosomal compartment (17Schreiber R. Stoll B. Lang F. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Schreiber R. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Schreiber R. Zhang F. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For fluorescence recording, the coverslips were mounted with PBS at 37 °C equilibrated with room atmosphere resulting in a pH of 7.4. Measurements of apparent pHves in single cells were performed with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert) combined with the QuantiCell 2000-calcium imaging setup (VisiTech, Sunderland, UK). This apparatus allows FITC-dextran fluorescence measurements at the single-cell levels at the excitation wavelengths of 488/440 nm with a time resolution of 10 Hz by a monochromator, and emission was measured at 515–565 nm using a CCD camera as provided by the QuantiCell 2000-calcium imaging setup. By use of regions of interest using the QuantiCell 2000 software, the field of measurement was chosen to be within one single cell. The raw fluorescence signals were corrected for autofluorescence as published previously (17Schreiber R. Stoll B. Lang F. Häussinger D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Values of apparent pHves were obtained from the corrected ratios of 488/440 nm after appropriate calibration according to Thomas et al. (20Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E.

To determine changes of the intracellular Cl--concentration, primary hepatocytes grown for 24 h on glass coverslips (diameter, 30 mm) were loaded for 6–10 h with the chloride-sensitive dye MQAE (1 mmol/liter) in phenol red-free culture medium in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C (21Marandi N. Konnerth A. Garaschuk O. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 445: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Then coverslips were transferred to single cell fluorescence recording using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert) combined with the QuantiCell 2000 calcium imaging setup (VisiTech). Cells were excited at 350 nm with a time resolution of 10 Hz by a monochromator, and emission was measured at 480–520 nm using a CCD camera as provided by the QuantiCell 2000 calcium imaging setup. By use of regions of interest using the QuantiCell 2000 software, the field of measurement was chosen to be within one single cell. A decrease in intracellular MQAE fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm thereby reflects an increase in the intracellular Cl- concentration (21Marandi N. Konnerth A. Garaschuk O. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 445: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fluorescence is given as relative fluorescence compared with the fluorescence at the beginning of the respective experiment (first second of the recording). Lipid Extraction and High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography—Cells were harvested at the indicated time points by scrapping the cells off the plate on ice. Pellets were washed and sonicated. Quantification of lipids was done using 500 μg of protein for Folch extraction (22Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of ceramides included a mild alkaline hydrolysis. The lower phase of Folch extraction was evaporated under nitrogen. The lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Samples and standards were separated on silica gel high performance thin layer chromatography plates (20 × 10 cm) Merck 60F 254s (Merck) prewashed for 60 min in 2-propanol and dried for 30 min at 120 °C. Samples and standards were applied to the TLC plates using a CAMAG Linomat IV (CAMAG, Berlin, Germany). For determination of ceramides, samples were separated using an automated multiple development (AMD) procedure on an AMD2 device (CAMAG). This procedure consisted of 7 repeated developments of the chromatogram using a stepwise elution gradient with methanol, dichloromethane, and n-hexane (methanol/dichloromethane/n-hexane: 100/0/0; 10/90/0; 9/91/0; 8/92/0; 3/97/0; 2/98/0; 0/0/100) (23Timmer A.

Visualization of separated bands was done by postchromatic derivatization after dipping in a manganese chloride solution according to Grether-Beck et al. (24Grether-Beck S. Bonizzi G.

After heating the plate for 10 min at 120 °C in a temperature-controlled oven, the plate was dried and scanned using a CAMAG TLC Scanner II and CATS software. Quantification was done by absorption at 550 nm with a plot of peak area versus weight spotted for a series of standards using a second-order polynomial calibration with 4 standard mixes in the range 50–1000 ng. Subcellular Fractionation—Hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated culture plates (diameter, 10 cm; Falcon) at a density of 8 × 106 cells/plate. Huh7 were cultured on culture plates (diameter, 6 cm; Falcon) and transfected with CD95-YFP as described above. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 10 mmol/liter Tris, 30 mmol/liter mannitol, and 10 mmol/liter CaCl2, pH 7.5. After centrifugation of the samples (5 min, 1200 × g), the supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation (35 min, 40,000 g) to separate the plasma membrane fraction (pellet) from the cytosolic compartment (supernatant). The latter fractions then underwent Western blotting as described above for CD95, GAPDH, and annexin II. GAPDH and annexin II served as m"

ErbB signaling regulates cell growth, differentiation, and migration, and loss of any of the ErbBs is embryonic lethal in mice with defects found in multiple organ systems (3Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ErbB signaling is also active in adults, and aberrant ErbB signaling is a feature of many human cancers and associates with more aggressive, metastatic tumors and a poorer prognosis (3Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hynes N.E. Lane H.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2709) Google Scholar). ErbBs consist of an extracellular ligand-binding region followed by a single membrane-spanning region, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, and a C-terminal tail of ∼230 amino acids (5Burgess A.W. Cho H.S. Eigenbrot C. Ferguson K.M. Garrett T.P. Leahy D.J. Lemmon M.A. Sliwkowski M.X. Ward C.W. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to the extracellular regions initiates signaling by causing formation of specific homo- or heterodimeric receptor complexes and activation of the cytoplasmic kinase, which results in autophosphorylation at several sites in the tail region (6Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3571) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at these sites promotes associations with effector proteins and initiation of downstream signaling events (7Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell.

Studies of the functional role of these phosphorylation sites led to identification of Memo (mediator of ErbB2-driven cell motility), a 297-amino-acid protein that is required for ErbB2-driven cell motility (10Marone R. Hess D. Dankort D. Muller W.J. Hynes N.E. Badache A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Memo co-precipitates with ErbB2 when tyrosine 1227 is phosphorylated and is not homologous to any known signaling protein. A single Memo protein is encoded in the human genome, but Memo homologs are found in all branches of life. Although Memo bound a phosphorylated form of an ErbB2-derived peptide encompassing Tyr-1227 (pYD) in a pull-down assay from cell lysates, this interaction appeared to depend on the presence of the Shc adaptor protein, and the association of Memo with ErbB2 was thought to be indirect (10Marone R. Hess D. Dankort D. Muller W.J. Hynes N.E. Badache A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Memo in ErbB2 signaling, we have determined the 2.1 Å crystal structure of human Memo. We show that Memo is structurally homologous to a class of nonheme iron dioxygenases, but we are unable to detect metal binding or enzymatic activity. Memo binds directly to an ErbB2-derived phosphopeptide, however, and appears to represent a new class of phosphotyrosine-binding protein. Protein Expression and Purification—A cDNA encoding full-length human Memo was subcloned into the pHT vector, which adds a cleavable N-terminal hexahistidine tag (11Geisbrecht B.V. Bouyain S. Pop M. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 46: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Memo expression was induced in Escherichia coli with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 22 °C, and Memo protein was purified using a nickel-chelating column. The N-terminal His tag was removed by overnight treatment with tobacco etch virus protease at 4 °C followed by a Uno-Q column. The Uno-Q flow-through was concentrated and chromatographed on a Superdex 75 size exclusion column. Fractions containing monomeric Memo were exchanged into distilled water with 1 mm dithiothreitol and concentrated to 5 mg/ml. Selenomethionine-containing Memo was produced by expression in E. coli strain B834(DE3) grown in the presence of selenomethionine and purified similarly to native protein. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals were grown by the hanging drop method by mixing protein 1:1 with 22.5% polyethylene glycol 3350/0.1 m MES, pH 5.5, and suspending the mixture over the polyethylene glycol solution at 20 °C. Crystals belong to space group P21212 with cell dimensions a = 139.8 Å, b = 88.8 Å, and c = 98.1 Å and contain four molecules in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were collected from a selenomethionine crystal at the selenium absorption edge at beamline X25 of the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory (see Table 1). Diffraction data from a native crystal soaked for 5 min in pH 8.0 mother liquor containing 5 mm ZnCl2 were collected at SGX-CAT at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. Diffraction data were processed using the HKL package (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38702) Google Scholar). 32 selenium sites were found by the program SnB (13Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl.

Shc was expressed in BL21(DE3) (codon plus R/L) E. coli by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 4 °C and purified over a HisTrap HP column (Amersham Biosciences). Shc-containing fractions were exchanged against Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2 buffer. Peptide Pull-down Assay—Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated YD peptides (SPAFDNLYYWDQNSSEKKK) and YC peptides (GGAVENPEYLVPREGTKKK) were coupled via the C-terminal lysines to Affi-gel 10 agarose beads (Bio-Rad). For the data shown in Fig. 4A, coupled beads were incubated with 500 ng of purified Memo or 50 ng of Shc in the presence of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 4 °C. For Fig. 4B, mutants of Memo carrying an N-terminal Myc tag were generated by the mega-primer method and ligated into pcDNA3.1. All sequences were verified prior to transfection into SKBr3 cells using FuGene (Roche Applied Science). 3 days later, cells were collected and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Coupled beads were incubated with 0.5 ml of SKBr3 cell lysates for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins bound to the beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with specific antibodies: Memo, Shc antibody (10Marone R. Hess D. Dankort D. Muller W.J. Hynes N.E. Badache A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC was performed using a VP-ITC apparatus (MicroCal, Northhampton, MA). Memo protein was dialyzed into 20 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 5.5, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. A 16-mer YD or pYD peptide (SPAFDNLYYWDQNSSE) was dissolved in the dialysate at a concentration of 0.35 mm and titrated into the 0.04 mm Memo solution in 25 injections at 15 °C. To examine whether Memo-pYD interactions are coupled to zinc binding, ITC experiments at pH 7.4 were performed in the absence or presence of zinc. Memo protein was dialyzed into 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The pYD peptide was dissolved in the dialysate. 0.4 mm peptide was titrated into 0.035 mm Memo solution. In a parallel experiment, 0.035 mm ZnCl2 was included in both the protein and the peptide buffer. Data analysis was performed using the Origin software supplied by MicroCal. Induction-coupled Argon Plasma (ICAP) Spectrometry Metal Analysis—E. coli cells containing the Memo plasmid were grown in Terrific Broth medium supplemented with 0.1 mm ZnCl2. Memo was purified as described above. Superdex 75 column fractions containing Memo (∼3 μm) were incubated with 5 μm ZnCl2 for 1 h, concentrated to 42 μm, and dialyzed for 3 h against 20 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The addition of a larger stoichiometric excess of zinc resulted in irreversible precipitation of Memo. A 2-ml sample of this Memo preparation was sent to the Chemical Analysis Laboratory at the University of Georgia for metal analysis on the Thermo Jarrell-Ash 965 ICAP instrument. Memo Structure—The crystal structure of full-length human Memo was determined by single wavelength anomalous diffraction, and the resulting atomic model was refined to 2.1 Å resolution (Table 1). All but the 5 N-terminal amino acids were modeled. Memo adopts a single domain structure with a mixed seven-strand β-sheet surrounded by nine α-helices (Fig. 1A). Secondary structure elements have been designated with numbers (strands) or letters (helices) in the order of their appearance in the primary sequence (Figs. 1A and 2). A search for structural homologs using the program DALI revealed Memo to be homologous to LigB, the catalytic β-subunit of the protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase LigAB from Sphingomonas paucimobilis (18Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 19Sugimoto K. Senda T. Aoshima H. Masai E. Fukuda M. Mitsui Y. Structure (Camb.). 1999; 7: 953-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and D). Superposition of Memo and LigB structures results in an r.m.s.d. of 2.86 Å for 190 matched α-carbon positions with 21 of the 190 matched residues (11%) identical. LigAB is a class III nonheme iron(II)-dependent extradiol-type catechol dioxygenase that catalyzes oxidative cleavage of substituted catechols in bacterial aromatic degradation pathways (20Noda Y. Nishikawa S. Shiozuka K. Kadokura H. Nakajima H. Yoda K. Katayama Y. Morohoshi N. Haraguchi T. Yamasaki M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2704-2709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite low (<15%) sequence identities, sequence homology between Memo and class III nonheme iron(II)-dependent dioxygenases is detected by PSI-BLAST after multiple iterations (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60532) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Sequence alignment of Memo homologs and LigB. The alignment among Memo family members was performed by ClustalW and includes Xenopus (Xe, CAJ83509), Drosophila melanogaster (Dm, AAL29092), Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce, NP_741570), Arabidopsis thaliana (At, AAM63443), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp, NP_594340), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc, YJR008W), Magnetospirillum magneticum (Mm, YP_423069), Desulfuromonas acetoxidans (Da, ZP_01311659), and Pelobacter carbinolicus (Pc, YP_357065). The alignment between Memo and LigB is based on structural superposition of the two proteins. Identical amino acids are highlighted in green, and similar residues in are highlighted in yellow. The number in parentheses indicates the number of aminoacids inserted relative to the alignment. The letter p above the Memo sequence indicates residues involved in ErbB2 peptide binding based on mutagenesis results. The red circles below the LigB sequence indicate residues coordinating the ferric ion. The letter b indicates the residue acting as potential catalytic base in LigB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LigB catalytic activity is mediated by an iron ion, which is coordinated by His-12, His-61, Glu-242, and a water molecule (19Sugimoto K. Senda T. Aoshima H. Masai E. Fukuda M. Mitsui Y. Structure (Camb.). 1999; 7: 953-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1B and 3). A third histidine, His-195, is believed to function as a general base during catalysis. Each of these histidines is conserved in Memo (His-49, His-81, and His-192, respectively), but Glu-242 is replaced by a cysteine (Cys-244) (Fig. 3). A glutamate to cysteine substitution at this site does not necessarily imply loss of metal binding; a cysteine side chain is capable of coordinating many metal ions including iron, and the side chain of Asp-189 in Memo is positioned so that it could coordinate a metal ion bound at this site and balance the positive charge (22Harding M.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1432-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Furthermore, cysteine, aspartic acid, and three histidines at the noted positions are all conserved in a subset of Memo/LigB homologs and appear to define a subfamily of proteins with the Memo/LigB fold (Fig. 2). A 2.3 Å crystal structure of the uncharacterized E. coli protein ygiD (JW3007) (Protein Data Bank accession code 2pw6) has recently been released, and this protein proves to be another distant structural homolog of Memo. The ygiD protein shares 11% sequence identity to Memo, clearly shares the same structural topology with Memo, and results in a DALI Z-score of 13.0 (values greater than 6.0 are taken to indicate highly significant structural homology) (18Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The ygiD protein binds three zinc ions, one of which is positioned in a site homologous to the putative metal-binding site in Memo. This zinc ion is ligated by a water molecule and three histidine residues (His-22, His-57, and His-234), which correspond to residues His-49, His-81, and Cys-244 in Memo, respectively. No Evidence for Strong Metal Binding by Memo—No electron density consistent with a bound metal ion is apparent in Memo. Memo crystals were grown at pH 5.5, however, and at this pH the histidines are likely to be protonated and less able to coordinate a metal ion. X-ray crystallographic, UV absorption, and fluorescence experiments were thus carried out at neutral pH to look for evidence of metal ion binding by Memo. Since iron(II) readily oxidizes and iron(III) is almost insoluble in aqueous solution, cobalt(II), which has a similar ionic radius and overlapping coordination properties as iron(II) (23Bertini I. Luchinat C. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1984; 6: 71-111PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lippard S. Berg J. Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994Google Scholar), is frequently used as a surrogate for iron or zinc binding. Cobalt-protein complexes exhibit characteristic peaks at 500–700 nm in UV-visible absorption spectra and another peak at 350 nm if a cysteine is involved in cobalt coordination (23Bertini I. Luchinat C. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1984; 6: 71-111PubMed Google Scholar). The UV-visible spectrum of a 0.03 mm solution of Memo in the presence of 0.5 mm CoCl2 failed to show either of these characteristic peaks. Fortuitously, Trp-16 is located in the potential metal-binding site of Memo, which enables fluorescence quenching experiments to test for substrate binding near this site, but FeSO4, Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, and CoCl2 titrated into Memo solutions failed to show any quenching of tryptophan fluorescence (data not shown). Memo crystals were soaked for 5 min in mother liquor adjusted to pH 8.0 and supplemented with 5 mm cobalt chloride or 5 mm zinc chloride, but difference Fourier maps calculated with diffraction data from these and native crystals showed no evidence for cobalt or zinc binding (Supplemental Fig. 1). The potential metal-binding site is accessible to solvent in Memo crystals. A Memo sample was submitted to the Chemical Analysis Laboratory at the University of Georgia for analysis by ICAP spectrometry. Purified Memo was incubated with ZnCl2 and then dialyzed against a solution without zinc. ICAP measurements showed a zinc concentration of 0.30 ppm for the Memo sample and 0.02 ppm for the dialysate. The calculated zinc concentration for 42 μm Memo would be 2.75 ppm with a protein:zinc stoichiometry of 1:1, which is ∼10-fold greater than the experimental value. Memo Binds pYD—Memo was identified in a screen of cell lysates for proteins that bind to an immobilized 16-residue phosphopeptide encompassing Tyr-1227 from rat ErbB2 (pYD) (10Marone R. Hess D. Dankort D. Muller W.J. Hynes N.E. Badache A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The adaptor protein Shc also bound pYD, and depletion of Shc from the cell lysates diminished the ability of Memo to associate with pYD (10Marone R. Hess D. Dankort D. Muller W.J. Hynes N.E. Badache A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For this reason, it was thought that interactions between Memo and pYD were likely to be indirect and possibly mediated by Shc. To test this proposal, purified Memo protein was assayed for its ability to bind pYD in the absence of other factors. Contrary to expectations, immobilized pYD is able to pull down purified Memo, and this ability to bind directly to Memo depends on phosphorylation at the Tyr-1227 site (Fig. 4A). In contrast pYC, a phosphorylated ErbB2 peptide encompassing Tyr-1201, is unable to pull down Memo. Consistent with earlier reports, purified Shc binds to both pYC and pYD (25Ricci A. Lanfrancone L. Chiari R Belardo G Perica C. Natali P.G. Segatto O. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1519-1529PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A, lower panel). A large cleft is present in the Memo structure at the site homologous to the dioxygenase active site (the “vestigial” active site) (Fig. 4C). To test whether this region is important for mediating interactions between pYD and Memo, 10 variant Memo proteins with amino acid substitutions in this cleft were assayed for their ability to interact with pYD in pull-down assays (Fig. 4B). Substitutions H49A, H81A, H192A, C244A, and W16A eliminated detectable pYD binding, and the Y54A substitution diminished pYD binding. Expression levels of the H49A and H81A Memo variants were slightly and markedly lower than wild-type Memo, respectively, and failure to observe pYD binding for at least the H81A variant may be due to a decreased amount of this protein. CD spectra of the H81A and H192A variant proteins indicate that they are folded (Supplemental Fig. 2). Cumulatively, these results indicate that the vestigial Memo active site and several histidine residues and Cys-244 in this region are important for pYD binding. The importance of histidine residues in Memo for pYD binding suggested that interactions between Memo and pYD might be pH-dependent. Pull-down assays were thus performed at different pHs and show that the strength of Memo binding to pYD indeed varies with pH, with Memo-pYD interactions stronger at lower pH and weaker at higher pH (Fig. 4D). This pH-dependent binding profile is consistent with a requirement for protonated histidines for optimal pYD binding, which suggests that these histidines may balance the charge of the phosphorylated tyrosine. To assess the strength of pYD binding to Memo, the dissociation constant for this interaction was measured at pH 5.5 by ITC and found to be 32 μm with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 5B). Consistent with results of the pull-down assays, no interaction was observed between Memo and unphosphorylated peptide (YD) by ITC (Fig. 5A). To examine whether Memo-pYD interactions are coupled to zinc binding, ITC experiments at pH 7.4 were performed in the absence or presence of stoichiometric amounts of zinc and showed that the presence of zinc had no effect (Fig. 5, C and D). Attempts to produce crystals of a Memo-pYD peptide complex have been unsuccessful. Several hundred conditions have been tried for each of an 8-mer, 12-mer, and 16-mer pYD-derived peptide using both factorial and standard grid screens. In addition, both colorimetric and mass spectrometric assays failed to detect any Memo-specific phosphatase activity. Memo was identified based on its ability to co-precipitate with a specific phosphopeptide within the cytoplasmic tail of HER2/ErbB2 and disrupt HER2/ErbB2-mediated cell migration when depleted by RNA interference (10Marone R. Hess D. Dankort D. Muller W.J. Hynes N.E. Badache A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We report here the crystal structure of human Memo and show that it is homologous to a class of nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenases. Many of the key active site residues are conserved between these dioxygenases and Memo, but an iron-coordinating glutamate found in dioxygenases is substituted with a cysteine in Memo (Cys-244). Although a cysteine side is capable of coordinating iron and other metals, we find no evidence for metal binding in vitro, which would be required for a dioxygenase-like activity. The recent deposition of atomic coordinates for the structurally homologous ygiD protein indicates that Memo/LigB structural scaffold can also accommodate a zinc ion. In this case, the zinc ion is coordinated by three histidines. Physiological protein-zinc dissociation constants are typically in the 10-10–10-12 m range (24Lippard S. Berg J. Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994Google Scholar), and both X-ray and ICAP experiments failed to detect strong zinc binding by Memo. Our experiments do not rule out the possibility that metal binding or enzymatic activity is a component of Memo activity, but in the absence of additional evidence, such properties seem unlikely. We do show, however, that Memo represents a new class of phosphotyrosine-binding protein. The dissociation constant of Memo for its cognate phosphopeptide (pYD) is 32 μm, which is lower than values of 50–500 nm typically observed for optimal phosphotyrosine interactions but comparable with values reported for at least some physiologically relevant interactions (26Zhou M.M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Crosby S. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31119-31123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Pawson T. Cell. 2004; 116: 191-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant of the Shc SH2 domain binding to an EGF receptor-derived phosphopeptide is 69 μm, for example (26Zhou M.M. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Crosby S. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31119-31123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Memo-pYD interactions are weaker at normal cellular pH, however, which casts some doubt on whether pYD binding by Memo represents a physiological interaction. On the other hand, Memo associates with the phosphorylated ErbB2 cytoplasmic tail in cells and is required for ErbB2-driven cell motility (10Marone R. Hess D. Dankort D. Muller W.J. Hynes N.E. Badache A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which strongly suggests that the direct interaction between Memo and pYD is unlikely to be entirely coincidental. Future experiments will be needed to resolve this issue, but one possibility is that Memo-pYD interactions are enhanced in vivo by the presence of additional factors. The diminished association observed between Memo and pYD in cell lysates depleted of Shc hints that Shc may be one such factor, possibly via its interactions with nearby tyrosine 1201 (pYC) (10Marone R. Hess D. Dankort D. Muller W.J. Hynes N.E. Badache A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2004; 6: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Much remains to be learned about Memo function in addition to resolving its role in binding to phospho-ErbB2. The presence of cysteine rather than glutamate at a metal-coordinating position in the dioxygenase active site appears to define a subfamily of proteins with the Memo-LigB fold (Fig. 2). The physiological function of members of this subfamily, and how these functions are conserved among different species, presents many intriguing questions. A Memo homolog with the cysteine substitution is present in yeast, for example, which lack receptor tyrosine kinases. This observation suggests that the Memo subfamily evolved functions independent of LigB-like dioxygenase activity before acquiring a role in ErbB signaling. Determining what these functions are and what role they play in different organisms promises to provide a rich ground for future exploration.

https://openalex.org/W2045741078,"The brain is self-writable; as the brain voluntarily adapts itself to a changing environment, the neural circuitry rearranges its functional connectivity by referring to its own activity. How the internal activity modifies synaptic weights is largely unknown, however. Here we report that spontaneous activity causes complex reorganization of synaptic connectivity without any external (or artificial) stimuli. Under physiologically relevant ionic conditions, CA3 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices displayed spontaneous spikes with bistable slow oscillations of membrane potential, alternating between the so-called UP and DOWN states. The generation of slow oscillations did not require fast synaptic transmission, but their patterns were coordinated by local circuit activity. In the course of generating spontaneous activity, individual neurons acquired bidirectional long-lasting synaptic modification. The spontaneous synaptic plasticity depended on a rise in intracellular calcium concentrations of postsynaptic cells, but not on NMDA receptor activity. The direction and amount of the plasticity varied depending on slow oscillation patterns and synapse locations, and thus, they were diverse in a network. Once this global synaptic refinement occurred, the same neurons now displayed different patterns of spontaneous activity, which in turn exhibited different levels of synaptic plasticity. Thus, active networks continuously update their internal states through ongoing synaptic plasticity. With computational simulations, we suggest that with this slow oscillation-induced plasticity, a recurrent network converges on a more specific state, compared to that with spike timing-dependent plasticity alone."
https://openalex.org/W1998802614,"An important level at which the expression of programmed cell death (PCD) genes is regulated is alternative splicing. Our previous work identified an intronic splicing regulatory element in caspase-2 (casp-2) gene. This 100-nucleotide intronic element, In100, consists of an upstream region containing a decoy 3' splice site and a downstream region containing binding sites for splicing repressor PTB. Based on the signal of In100 element in casp-2, we have detected the In100-like sequences as a family of sequence elements associated with alternative splicing in the human genome by using computational and experimental approaches. A survey of human genome reveals the presence of more than four thousand In100-like elements in 2757 genes. These In100-like elements tend to locate more frequent in intronic regions than exonic regions. EST analyses indicate that the presence of In100-like elements correlates with the skipping of their immediate upstream exons, with 526 genes showing exon skipping in such a manner. In addition, In100-like elements are found in several human caspase genes near exons encoding the caspase active domain. RT-PCR experiments show that these caspase genes indeed undergo alternative splicing in a pattern predicted to affect their functional activity. Together, these results suggest that the In100-like elements represent a family of intronic signals for alternative splicing in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2062407106,"Upon exposure to DNA damaging agents, Saccharomyces cerevisiae respond by activating a massive transcriptional program that reflects the fact that ""DNA damaging"" agents also damage other cellular macromolecules. To identify the transcriptional response that is specific to DNA damage, we have modulated the first two enzymes in the base excision repair (BER) pathway generating yeast strains with varied levels of the repair intermediates, abasic sites or strand breaks. We show that the number of abasic sites is significantly increased when the 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (Mag): AP endonuclease (Apn1) ratio is increased and that spontaneous frame shift mutation is considerably elevated when either Mag, or Mag plus Apn1, expression is elevated. Expression profiling identified 633 ORFs with differential expression associated with BER modulation. Analysis of transcriptional networks associated with the accumulation of DNA repair intermediates identifies an enrichment for numerous biological processes. Moreover, most of the BER-activated transcriptional response was independent of the classical yeast environmental stress response (ESR). This study highlights that DNA damage in the form of abasic sites or strand breaks resulting from BER modulation is a trigger for substantial genome-wide change and that this response is largely ESR-independent. Taken together, these results suggest that a branch point exists in the current model for DNA damage-signaled transcription in S. cerevisiae."

Vanderleyden J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 17-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the name implies, the LPS is a complex glycoconjugate that varies from species to species in specific content, but in all cases it is thought to provide a permeability barrier to hydrophobic or negatively charged molecules. Conceptually, the LPS can be thought of in terms of three regions: lipid A, the core oligosaccharide, and the O-specific polysaccharide (2Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). Lipid A, which anchors the sugar components of the LPS to the bacterial cell outer membrane, has been implicated in the toxicity associated with Gram-negative infections. Unlike the typical lipids attached to glycerol, however, lipid A is a glucosamine-based phospholipid (2Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar) and is connected to the core polysaccharide of the LPS via 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid. Besides 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid, the core polysaccharide usually contains heptose (typically l-glycero-d-manno-heptose), galactose, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine. The O-specific polysaccharide region, which extends farthest away from the bacterium, displays the most variation from species to species. This region, also referred to as the O-antigen, consists of repeating units, which typically contain 3-5 sugars. Indeed, the carbohydrate differences within the O-antigens contribute to the wide varieties of bacterial strains observed in nature. The O-antigens often contain some quite remarkable and unusual dideoxysugars, including tyvelose, paratose, abequose, perosamine, and colitose. These sugars are added to the LPS via the action of glyco-syltransferases, which employ nucleotide-linked derivatives, such as CDP-tyvelose or GDP-colitose, as substrates. lipopolysaccharide pyridoxal 5′-phosphate electrospray ionization 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid pyridoxamine-5′-phosphate. lipopolysaccharide pyridoxal 5′-phosphate electrospray ionization 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid pyridoxamine-5′-phosphate. The research described here focuses on one of the enzymes involved in the production of GDP-colitose, namely GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose-3-dehydratase, hereafter referred to as ColD. As shown in Scheme 1, the biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of GDP-colitose requires four different enzymes. ColD catalyzes the third step, which is the removal of the C3′-hydroxyl group from GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose. It requires pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) for activity, but unlike most PLP-dependent enzymes, the cofactor is not covalently attached to the protein via a lysine residue. In place of the lysine is His-188, and the functional form of the cofactor in ColD is PMP, which is derived from the reaction of PLP with l-glutamate. Recently, a three-dimensional structural analysis of ColD was reported from this laboratory (3Cook P.D. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2093-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This study revealed that ColD belongs to the well characterized aspartate aminotransferase superfamily. As shown in Fig. 1, each subunit of the dimeric enzyme is dominated by a mixed eight-stranded β-sheet flanked by eight α-helices. Additional β-strands and α-helices complete the overall tertiary structure of ColD. Amino acid residues from both subunits contribute to the active site regions of the dimer. A possible catalytic mechanism for ColD, based on all presently available biochemical and structural data, is presented in Scheme 2 (3Cook P.D. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2093-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Alam J. Beyer N. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16450-16460Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the first step, a Schiff base is formed between the sugar C4′ and the PMP cofactor with the concomitant loss of a water molecule. This is referred to as the external aldimine. In the next step, the side chain of His-188 abstracts the proR proton from the cofactor C4′ and delivers it to the sugar C3′-hydroxyl group, thereby facilitating its departure and the subsequent generation of a Δ3,4-aminomannoseen intermediate. This intermediate is hydrolyzed by a water molecule to yield free PLP and an aminated sugar moiety. It is thought that the hydrogen incorporated at the sugar C3′ in the next step of the mechanism is derived from the protonated form of His 188. Presently, it is not known whether the final expulsion of ammonia occurs on the enzyme or in solution. Although the original structures of ColD defined the manner in which both the hydrated form of PLP and a glutamate-ketimine intermediate were accommodated within the active site pocket, crystallization experiments of ColD in the presence of its sugar substrate never led to clearly interpretable electron density for the ligand. Most likely, either the enzyme was active in the crystalline lattice and the product was being released, or the substrate, GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose, was unstable in the crystallization solutions. In an effort to address the issue of substrate binding to ColD, we initiated a two-pronged approach. The first step was to prepare a site-directed mutant protein of ColD in which the active site base, His-188, was changed to an asparagine residue. The second step was to clone, overexpress, and purify GDP-perosamine synthase, which catalyzes the production of GDP-perosamine from GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose, the same substrate used by ColD (Scheme 1). Note that the difference between GDP-perosamine and the natural ColD substrate is the replacement of the keto group at C4′ with an amino functionality. The reasoning behind this was that GDP-perosamine might be more stable in the ColD crystallization conditions. In addition, if the proposed catalytic mechanism is correct as outlined in Scheme 2, then GDP-perosamine might react with PLP in the ColD active site to form a covalent intermediate. By using this combined approach, we were able to trap a nucleotide-linked sugar in the active site of ColD. Here we describe the high resolution structural analysis of this ColD H188N-nucleotide-linked sugar complex. We also present activity assays demonstrating that this mutant form of the protein cannot function as a dehydratase. Finally, we demonstrate that the wild-type form of ColD can, in fact, catalyze the formation of GDP-4-keto-3,6-dideoxymannose using GDP-perosamine rather than GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose as a substrate, which further supports the proposed mechanism outlined in Scheme 2. Cloning, Site-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification of ColD H188N–The gene encoding ColD was isolated as previously described (3Cook P.D. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2093-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and used to produce the ColD-pET28JT plasmid. His-188 was changed to an asparagine through site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following primer and its reverse complement: ggaacatttagctctttctattctaatcatatagctaccatgg. Mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The protein was expressed, purified, and digested with TEV protease as previously described (3Cook P.D. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2093-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It was then dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl. Following dialysis, the sample was concentrated to 25 mg/ml as estimated by the absorbance at 280 nm (extinction coefficient of 0.98 (mg/ml) -1 cm-1, determined by the Prot-Param tool from the Expasy Proteomics Server). The wild-type enzyme required for functional studies was expressed and purified as previously reported (3Cook P.D. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2093-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Production of GDP-Perosamine–Two enzymes were required for the production of GDP-perosamine, namely GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and GDP-perosamine synthase. The GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase was prepared as previously described (5Cook P.D. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 14215-14224Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The gene RfbE, which encodes GDP-perosamine synthase, was isolated from the enterohemorrhagic strain of Escherichia coli, O157:H7 using a procedure identical to that previously described for the ColD gene (3Cook P.D. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2093-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The resulting GDP-perosamine synthase-pET28JT plasmid was then used to transform HMS 174 E. coli cells (Novagen). Protein expression and purification were performed in a similar manner as that described for ColD (3Cook P.D. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2093-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). GDP-perosamine was produced by reacting 5 mm GDP-mannose (Sigma), 20 mm glutamate, 1 mm PLP, 1 mm NADP+, 3 μm GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase, and 1 μm GDP-perosamine synthase in Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 2 h, after which it was heat-denatured for 2 min to precipitate the protein. The reaction mixture was then cooled on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was removed from the protein pellet. The reaction supernatant was subsequently purified by an ÄKTA Purifier high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with a Resource-Q 6-ml anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was first equilibrated with Buffer B (20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5), after which the reaction supernatant was loaded onto the column, washed, and eluted with a linear gradient to 60% Buffer C (500 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5). The flow rate was 6 ml/min, and the elution was monitored at 253 nm. The fractions containing GDP-perosamine were pooled and freeze dried using a Labconco 1 L Freezone lyophilizer. Identity of the GDP-perosamine product was confirmed by ESI mass spectroscopic analysis (Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics Facility at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Solid GDP-perosamine was redissolved in water, and its concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 253 nm with an extinction coefficient of 1.38 × 104 m-1 cm-1. Crystallization of H188N ColD–Crystallization conditions were first surveyed by the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion using a sparse matrix screen developed in the laboratory. Large single crystals were subsequently grown via batch methods as previously described (3Cook P.D. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2093-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the protein solutions were typically 25 mg/ml, and they contained 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl. The precipitant solution contained 100 mm MES (pH 6.0), 28% polyethylene glycol 3400, 400 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PLP, 2 mm α-ketoglutarate, and 10 mm GDP-perosamine. The crystals grew to maximum dimensions of 0.2 × 0.5 × 0.8 mm in ∼10 days and belonged to the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 62.4 Å, b = 98.1 Å, and c = 119.9 Å. The asymmetric unit contained the complete ColD H188N dimer. X-ray Structural Analysis of H188N ColD–X-ray data were collected in house using a Bruker Proteum CCD detector system. The x-ray source was CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU200 x-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA. Single crystals were transferred in three steps to a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% polyethylene glycol 3400, 100 mm MES (pH 6.0), 500 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 15% ethylene glycol, 1 mm PLP, 2 mm α-ketoglutarate, and 30 mm GDP-perosamine. The crystals were then frozen in a cryostream, and an x-ray data set was collected from a single crystal. The x-ray data were processed with SAINT version 7.06A (Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI) and internally scaled with SADABS version 2005/1 (Bruker AXS).

D. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and employing the wild-type ColD structure as a search model (Protein Data Bank accession number 2GMU). All solvent molecules and the coordinates for His-188 and the PLP were omitted from the search probe. The resulting model was subjected to least-squares refinement with the program TNT (7Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Model building was performed with the program Coot (8Emsley P. Cowtan K.

As observed in the wild-type ColD structure, residues Met-193, Val-334, and Asn-354 in both subunits adopted φ, ψ angles lying outside of the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, specifically in the “nucleophile elbow” region. Other than these, the Ramachandran statistics indicate that 90.7% of the residues adopt φ, ψ angles in the “most favored,” 8.9% in the “additionally allowed,” and 0.4% in the “generously allowed” regions.TABLE 2Relevant least squares refinement statisticsParametersValuesResolution limits (Å)30-1.7R-factor (overall) (%)/No. of reflectionsaR-factor = (Σ|Fo - Fc|/Σ|Fo|) × 100, where Fo is the observed structure factor amplitude, and Fc is the calculated structure factor amplitude.17.8/75,508R-factor (working) (%)/No. of reflections17.5/67,920R-factor (free) (%)/No. of reflections26.1/7588No. of protein atoms6231No. of heteroatomsbThese include 665 water molecules, two PLP derivatives, three ethylene glycol molecules, and eight sodium ions.791Average B valuesProtein atoms (Å2)20.4PLP derivatives (Å2)24.5Solvent (Å2)28.6Weighted root mean square deviations from idealityBond lengths (Å)0.012Bond angles (degrees)1.7Trigonal planes (Å)cThe torsional angles were not restrained during the refinement.0.008General planes (Å)0.018Torsional angles (degrees)17.7a R-factor = (Σ|Fo - Fc|/Σ|Fo|) × 100, where Fo is the observed structure factor amplitude, and Fc is the calculated structure factor amplitude.b These include 665 water molecules, two PLP derivatives, three ethylene glycol molecules, and eight sodium ions.c The torsional angles were not restrained during the refinement. Open table in a new tab ColD H188N Dehydratase Activity Assay–Typical ColD reactions contained 1 mm GDP-mannose, 2 mm l-glutamate, 0.2 mm PLP, 0.2 mm NADP+, 3 μm GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase, and 1 μm ColD in Buffer A. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 4 h and heat-denatured for 2 min to precipitate the protein. Samples were then cooled on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min. Supernatants were removed and diluted 1:10 in water with 4% Buffer C. ColD activity was qualitatively determined by analyzing reaction mixtures with mass spectrometry. The reactions were purified via HPLC. Diluted reactions were loaded onto the column and eluted with a linear gradient to 60% Buffer C. The flow rate was 2 ml/min, and the elution was monitored at 253 nm. Fractions from the peak corresponding to GDP-linked ketosugars (eluted at 185 mm ammonium bicarbonate) were pooled and lyophilized. Reaction contents were identified by ESI mass spectrometry. GDP-Perosamine Assay–A reaction mixture containing 5 mm GDP-perosamine, 0.1 mm PLP, and 50 μm ColD wild-type protein was incubated at room temperature in Buffer A for 4 h. The reaction was heat-denatured for 2 min, cooled on ice, and centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 × g. This reaction was repeated in the absence of ColD. The reaction contents were analyzed via HPLC. The column was equilibrated with Buffer B, and the reaction supernatant was loaded and eluted with a linear gradient to 100% Buffer C. The flow rate was 2 ml/min, and the elution was monitored at 253 nm. The contents of individual peaks were identified by ESI mass spectrometry. Overall, the electron densities corresponding to the polypeptide chain backbones for both subunits of the ColD dimer were well ordered. As expected, the conservative change of a histidine to an asparagine residue resulted in no gross structural perturbations. Indeed, the α-carbons for the wild-type and the H188N ColD proteins superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.6 Å using the algorithm described by Krissinel and Henrick (9Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). Given that the electron density was somewhat better for the second subunit in the x-ray coordinate file, however, the following discussion specifically refers to it unless otherwise indicated. Shown in Fig. 2a is the electron density corresponding to the site of the mutation (H188N), the PLP cofactor, and the nucleotide-linked sugar. The nucleotide ribose adopts the C2′-endo pucker, whereas the perosamine moiety assumes the B2,5 rather than the more typically observed chair conformations. As depicted in Fig. 2b, the external aldimine is trapped within the active site cleft and is buried deeply between the two subunits of the dimer, with only a small portion of the guanine ring and the phosphoryl moieties exposed to the solvent. A close-up view of the H188N ColD active site is presented in Fig. 2c. The guanine ring of the nucleotide is anchored to the protein via hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Lys-26, the backbone amide group of Phe-28, and Oγ of Thr-29, all contributed by Subunit 1. A water molecule also lies within hydrogen bonding distance to the guanine ring. The 3′-hydroxyl group of the ribose hydrogen-bonds to the carboxylate of Glu-329, whereas the pyrophosphoryl oxygens interact extensively with four water molecules, the guanidinium group of Arg-219 from Subunit 1, and the guanidinium group of Arg-331 from Subunit 2. Strikingly, there are no specific interactions between the pyranosyl hydroxyls and the protein. Instead, water molecules serve to fulfill the hydrogen bonding potentials of these hydroxyls. The pyridoxal ring participates in hydrogen bonding interactions with both Asp-159 and Glu-162, and the phosphate moiety of the cofactor is positioned firmly in place by seven hydrogen bonds, three contributed by side chains (Ser-57 and Ser-183 from Subunit 2 and Asn-248 from Subunit 1), two from backbone amide groups (Gly-56 and Ser-57), and two from ordered waters. Trp-88 and Tyr-186 participate in stacking interactions with the pyridoxal ring of the cofactor and the guanine base of the nucleotide-linked sugar, respectively. A superposition of the active sites for the wild-type and the H188N ColD proteins is presented in Fig. 3. Overall the active sites are similar with a few notable exceptions. First the side chain of Arg-331 in H188N ColD moves in toward the active site to interact with the pyrophosphoryl groups of the nucleotide-linked sugar. Second, the ψ angle of Tyr-186 flips from ∼136° in the wild-type protein to -47° in the mutant enzyme, resulting in a change in orientation of the side chain for Ser-187. The other significant difference occurs at the site of the mutation. Whereas the imidazole group of His-188 is directed toward the active site in the wild-type enzyme, in the mutant protein, the asparagine side chain shifts slightly away. Importantly, in the mutant protein, a water molecule fills the space normally occupied by Nϵ2 of His-188. Wild-type ColD catalyzes the removal of the C3′-hydroxyl from the hexose ring via a ping-pong catalytic mechanism where in the first half PLP is converted to PMP via its reaction with l-glutamate. The second dehydration step results in the expulsion of the C3′-hydroxyl group (Scheme 2). To address whether the H188N ColD protein can catalyze this dehydration step, the following sets of experiments were conducted. First, the reaction of GDP-mannose with GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (Scheme 1) without the addition of ColD was followed by ESI mass spectrometry, and the results are shown in Fig. 4A. The peak at 586.3 atomic mass units corresponds to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose, the product of the dehydratase reaction. The additional peaks observed at 442.2 and 362.1 atomic mass units are fragmentation peaks corresponding to GDP and GMP, respectively. When the same reaction was carried out in the presence of wild-type ColD, the mass spectrum (Fig. 4B) indicated the conversion of the 586.3 atomic mass units peak into a new peak at 570.2 atomic mass units, which corresponds to GDP-4-keto-3,6-dideoxymannose. This conversion does not occur in the presence of H188N ColD (Fig. 4C), thus indicating that the mutant protein cannot catalyze the second half of the ping-pong mechanism. In our initial attempts to elucidate the structure of ColD with a bound sugar substrate, GDP-perosamine (Scheme 1) was added to wild-type ColD in concentrations of up to 20 mm. However, GDP-linked sugars were never observed at high enough occupancies to allow for their unambiguous placement into the electron density, although there were two rather large peaks that probably corresponded to the phosphoryl groups. It was reasoned that, perhaps, ColD was converting GDP-perosamine to GDP-4-keto-3,6-dideoxymannose, which was then simply dissociating from the enzyme. To test this hypothesis, we incubated wild-type ColD with GDP-perosamine and PLP and in the absence of glutamate (the natural amino donor of ColD). Remarkably, ColD converted GDP-perosamine into the natural ColD product, GDP-4-keto-3,6-dideoxymannose (Fig. 5). Since GDP-perosamine is a 4-amino sugar, it can act as both the amino donor and the substrate of the dehydratase reaction. Given this additional activity of ColD, it explains why a mutant form of ColD was required to trap a GDP-linked sugar within the active site pocket. A possible mechanism for the conversion of GDP-perosamine to GDP-4-keto-3,6-didexoy-mannose is presented in Scheme 3. In this mechanism, the amino group at C4′ of the hexose forms a Schiff base with the PLP cofactor that is held in the ColD active site via noncovalent interactions. His-188 functions first as the base to abstract the hydrogen at the sugar C4′, leading to the formation of a quinonoid intermediate and its associated resonance forms and then as an acid to protonate the C3′-hydroxyl group. Upon protonation, the hydroxyl group departs resulting in the formation of the Δ3,4-aminomannoseen intermediate. At this stage, the catalytic mechanism is identical to that presented in Scheme 2.SCHEME 3A possible mechanism for the conversion of GDP-perosamine to GDP-4-keto-3,6-dideoxymannose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thus far, five additional x-ray crystallographic structures of sugar modifying aminotransferases have been reported: (a) ArnB from Salmonella typhimurium, a 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose lipopolysaccharide-modifying enzyme (10Noland B.W.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8999-9006Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); and (e) DesV, the second aminotransferase in the desosamine biosynthetic pathway (14Burgie E.S. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Until the present report, only the structures of DesI and PseC were solved in the presence of nucleotide-linked sugars. Both of these enzymes transfer an amino group to the C4′ position of the sugar, albeit with differing stereochemistry, which most likely arises from the manner in which the sugars are oriented in the active sites (13Burgie E.S. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8999-9006Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In both cases, the hexose moieties assume the 4C1 conformations. Strikingly, in ColD, which functions as a dehydratase, the hexose adopts the less commonly observed B2,5 conformation. Shown in Fig. 6 is a superposition of the observed boat conformation of perosamine and a model of the sugar in the 4C1 conformation. Also included in Fig. 6 is the position of His-188 in the wild-type structure and the location of the water molecule that fills the cavity created when His-188 is replaced with an asparagine residue. Why does perosamine adopt the boat conformation in the ColD active site? One reason might be due to steric hindrance from Phe-185 (Fig. 6). If the sugar adopted the 4C1 conformation, its C2′-hydroxyl would be positioned within ∼2.6 Å of the aromatic ring. The boat conformation might also arise from a variety of additional effects, including the manner in which the pyrophosphoryl oxygens of the nucleotide-linked sugar are coordinated by Arg-219 and Arg-331. ColD is a PMP-dependent dehydratase, whereas ArnB, PseC, PglE, DesI, and DesV are PLP-dependent aminotransferases. Perhaps the adoption of the boat conformation somehow favors a dehydration reaction, or maybe the reaction specificity results from a combination of subtle differences in the constellation of the active site residues. Experiments are presently under way to address this intriguing issue.
