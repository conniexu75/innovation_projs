https://openalex.org/W4295777530,"After the global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2, some BA.2 subvariants, including BA.2.9.1, BA.2.11, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5, emerged in multiple countries. Our statistical analysis showed that the effective reproduction numbers of these BA.2 subvariants are greater than that of the original BA.2. Neutralization experiments revealed that the immunity induced by BA.1/2 infections is less effective against BA.4/5. Cell culture experiments showed that BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 replicate more efficiently in human alveolar epithelial cells than BA.2, and particularly, BA.4/5 is more fusogenic than BA.2. We further provided the structure of the BA.4/5 spike receptor-binding domain that binds to human ACE2 and considered how the substitutions in the BA.4/5 spike play roles in ACE2 binding and immune evasion. Moreover, experiments using hamsters suggested that BA.4/5 is more pathogenic than BA.2. Our multiscale investigations suggest that the risk of BA.2 subvariants, particularly BA.4/5, to global health is greater than that of original BA.2."
https://openalex.org/W4302010773,"Improving the efficiency of algorithms for fundamental computations can have a widespread impact, as it can affect the overall speed of a large amount of computations. Matrix multiplication is one such primitive task, occurring in many systems-from neural networks to scientific computing routines. The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero1 for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, AlphaTensor, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4 × 4 matrices in a finite field, where AlphaTensor's algorithm improves on Strassen's two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago2. We further showcase the flexibility of AlphaTensor through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight AlphaTensor's ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria."
https://openalex.org/W4302010968,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, develops almost exclusively in patients with chronic liver disease and advanced fibrosis1,2. Here we interrogated functions of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main source of liver fibroblasts3, during hepatocarcinogenesis. Genetic depletion, activation or inhibition of HSCs in mouse models of HCC revealed their overall tumour-promoting role. HSCs were enriched in the preneoplastic environment, where they closely interacted with hepatocytes and modulated hepatocarcinogenesis by regulating hepatocyte proliferation and death. Analyses of mouse and human HSC subpopulations by single-cell RNA sequencing together with genetic ablation of subpopulation-enriched mediators revealed dual functions of HSCs in hepatocarcinogenesis. Hepatocyte growth factor, enriched in quiescent and cytokine-producing HSCs, protected against hepatocyte death and HCC development. By contrast, type I collagen, enriched in activated myofibroblastic HSCs, promoted proliferation and tumour development through increased stiffness and TAZ activation in pretumoural hepatocytes and through activation of discoidin domain receptor 1 in established tumours. An increased HSC imbalance between cytokine-producing HSCs and myofibroblastic HSCs during liver disease progression was associated with increased HCC risk in patients. In summary, the dynamic shift in HSC subpopulations and their mediators during chronic liver disease is associated with a switch from HCC protection to HCC promotion. Subpopulations of cytokine-producing and myofibroblastic hepatic stellate cells, identified by single-cell RNA sequencing, protect against or promote the development of hepatocellular carcinoma via high expression of hepatocyte growth factor or type I collagen, respectively.."
https://openalex.org/W4302010978,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged at the end of 2019 and caused the devastating global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in part because of its ability to effectively suppress host cell responses1-3. In rare cases, viral proteins dampen antiviral responses by mimicking critical regions of human histone proteins4-8, particularly those containing post-translational modifications required for transcriptional regulation9-11. Recent work has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 markedly disrupts host cell epigenetic regulation12-14. However, how SARS-CoV-2 controls the host cell epigenome and whether it uses histone mimicry to do so remain unclear. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 protein encoded by ORF8 (ORF8) functions as a histone mimic of the ARKS motifs in histone H3 to disrupt host cell epigenetic regulation. ORF8 is associated with chromatin, disrupts regulation of critical histone post-translational modifications and promotes chromatin compaction. Deletion of either the ORF8 gene or the histone mimic site attenuates the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to disrupt host cell chromatin, affects the transcriptional response to infection and attenuates viral genome copy number. These findings demonstrate a new function of ORF8 and a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 disrupts host cell epigenetic regulation. Further, this work provides a molecular basis for the finding that SARS-CoV-2 lacking ORF8 is associated with decreased severity of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4302010994,"An immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment is a major obstacle in the control of pancreatic and other solid cancers1–3. Agonists of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein trigger inflammatory innate immune responses to potentially overcome tumour immunosuppression4. Although these agonists hold promise as potential cancer therapies5, tumour resistance to STING monotherapy has emerged in clinical trials and the mechanism(s) is unclear5–7. Here we show that the administration of five distinct STING agonists, including cGAMP, results in an expansion of human and mouse interleukin (IL)-35+ regulatory B cells in pancreatic cancer. Mechanistically, cGAMP drives expression of IL-35 by B cells in an IRF3-dependent but type I interferon-independent manner. In several preclinical cancer models, the loss of STING signalling in B cells increases tumour control. Furthermore, anti-IL-35 blockade or genetic ablation of IL-35 in B cells also reduces tumour growth. Unexpectedly, the STING–IL-35 axis in B cells reduces proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells and attenuates the NK-driven anti-tumour response. These findings reveal an intrinsic barrier to systemic STING agonist monotherapy and provide a combinatorial strategy to overcome immunosuppression in tumours. Systemic treatment of pancreatic cancer with STING agonist stimulates regulatory B cells to express immunosuppressive cytokine IL-35, which weakens the anti-tumour function of natural killer cells."
https://openalex.org/W4302011048,"Abstract DNA transfer from cytoplasmic organelles to the cell nucleus is a legacy of the endosymbiotic event—the majority of nuclear-mitochondrial segments (NUMTs) are thought to be ancient, preceding human speciation 1–3 . Here we analyse whole-genome sequences from 66,083 people—including 12,509 people with cancer—and demonstrate the ongoing transfer of mitochondrial DNA into the nucleus, contributing to a complex NUMT landscape. More than 99% of individuals had at least one of 1,637 different NUMTs, with 1 in 8 individuals having an ultra-rare NUMT that is present in less than 0.1% of the population. More than 90% of the extant NUMTs that we evaluated inserted into the nuclear genome after humans diverged from apes. Once embedded, the sequences were no longer under the evolutionary constraint seen within the mitochondrion, and NUMT-specific mutations had a different mutational signature to mitochondrial DNA. De novo NUMTs were observed in the germline once in every 10 4 births and once in every 10 3 cancers. NUMTs preferentially involved non-coding mitochondrial DNA, linking transcription and replication to their origin, with nuclear insertion involving multiple mechanisms including double-strand break repair associated with PR domain zinc-finger protein 9 (PRDM9) binding. The frequency of tumour-specific NUMTs differed between cancers, including a probably causal insertion in a myxoid liposarcoma. We found evidence of selection against NUMTs on the basis of size and genomic location, shaping a highly heterogenous and dynamic human NUMT landscape."
https://openalex.org/W4302010984,"Abstract Self-organizing neural organoids grown from pluripotent stem cells 1–3 combined with single-cell genomic technologies provide opportunities to examine gene regulatory networks underlying human brain development. Here we acquire single-cell transcriptome and accessible chromatin data over a dense time course in human organoids covering neuroepithelial formation, patterning, brain regionalization and neurogenesis, and identify temporally dynamic and brain-region-specific regulatory regions. We developed Pando—a flexible framework that incorporates multi-omic data and predictions of transcription-factor-binding sites to infer a global gene regulatory network describing organoid development. We use pooled genetic perturbation with single-cell transcriptome readout to assess transcription factor requirement for cell fate and state regulation in organoids. We find that certain factors regulate the abundance of cell fates, whereas other factors affect neuronal cell states after differentiation. We show that the transcription factor GLI3 is required for cortical fate establishment in humans, recapitulating previous research performed in mammalian model systems. We measure transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in normal or GLI3-perturbed cells and identify two distinct GLI3 regulomes that are central to telencephalic fate decisions: one regulating dorsoventral patterning with HES4/5 as direct GLI3 targets, and one controlling ganglionic eminence diversification later in development. Together, we provide a framework for how human model systems and single-cell technologies can be leveraged to reconstruct human developmental biology."

Here, we demonstrate through in vitro and in vivo models, as well as human AD brain tissue, that X-linked ubiquitin specific peptidase 11 (USP11) augments pathological tau aggregation via tau deubiquitination initiated at lysine-281. Removal of ubiquitin provides access for enzymatic tau acetylation at lysines 281 and 274. USP11 escapes complete X-inactivation, and female mice and people both exhibit higher USP11 levels than males. Genetic elimination of usp11 in a tauopathy mouse model preferentially protects females from acetylated tau accumulation, tau pathology, and cognitive impairment. USP11 levels also strongly associate positively with tau pathology in females but not males. Thus, inhibiting USP11-mediated tau deubiquitination may provide an effective therapeutic opportunity to protect women from increased vulnerability to AD and other tauopathies.

https://openalex.org/W4302010917,"The spread of antibiotic resistance is attracting increased attention to combination-based treatments. Although drug combinations have been studied extensively for their effects on bacterial growth1-11, much less is known about their effects on bacterial long-term clearance, especially at cidal, clinically relevant concentrations12-14. Here, using en masse microplating and automated image analysis, we systematically quantify Staphylococcus aureus survival during prolonged exposure to pairwise and higher-order cidal drug combinations. By quantifying growth inhibition, early killing and longer-term population clearance by all pairs of 14 antibiotics, we find that clearance interactions are qualitatively different, often showing reciprocal suppression whereby the efficacy of the drug mixture is weaker than any of the individual drugs alone. Furthermore, in contrast to growth inhibition6-10 and early killing, clearance efficacy decreases rather than increases as more drugs are added. However, specific drugs targeting non-growing persisters15-17 circumvent these suppressive effects. Competition experiments show that reciprocal suppressive drug combinations select against resistance to any of the individual drugs, even counteracting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus both in vitro and in a Galleria mellonella larva model. As a consequence, adding a β-lactamase inhibitor that is commonly used to potentiate treatment against β-lactam-resistant strains can reduce rather than increase treatment efficacy. Together, these results underscore the importance of systematic mapping the long-term clearance efficacy of drug combinations for designing more-effective, resistance-proof multidrug regimes."
https://openalex.org/W4300978964,"The mechanism that initiates autophagosome formation on the ER in multicellular organisms is elusive. Here, we showed that autophagy stimuli trigger Ca2+ transients on the outer surface of the ER membrane, whose amplitude, frequency, and duration are controlled by the metazoan-specific ER transmembrane autophagy protein EPG-4/EI24. Persistent Ca2+ transients/oscillations on the cytosolic ER surface in EI24-depleted cells cause accumulation of FIP200 autophagosome initiation complexes on the ER. This defect is suppressed by attenuating ER Ca2+ transients. Multi-modal SIM analysis revealed that Ca2+ transients on the ER trigger the formation of dynamic and fusion-prone liquid-like FIP200 puncta. Starvation-induced Ca2+ transients on lysosomes also induce FIP200 puncta that further move to the ER. Multiple FIP200 puncta on the ER, whose association depends on the ER proteins VAPA/B and ATL2/3, assemble into autophagosome formation sites. Thus, Ca2+ transients are crucial for triggering phase separation of FIP200 to specify autophagosome initiation sites in metazoans."
https://openalex.org/W4302010997,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly desmoplastic, aggressive cancer that frequently progresses and spreads by metastasis to the liver1. Cancer-associated fibroblasts, the extracellular matrix and type I collagen (Col I) support2,3 or restrain the progression of PDAC and may impede blood supply and nutrient availability4. The dichotomous role of the stroma in PDAC, and the mechanisms through which it influences patient survival and enables desmoplastic cancers to escape nutrient limitation, remain poorly understood. Here we show that matrix-metalloprotease-cleaved Col I (cCol I) and intact Col I (iCol I) exert opposing effects on PDAC bioenergetics, macropinocytosis, tumour growth and metastasis. Whereas cCol I activates discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1)-NF-κB-p62-NRF2 signalling to promote the growth of PDAC, iCol I triggers the degradation of DDR1 and restrains the growth of PDAC. Patients whose tumours are enriched for iCol I and express low levels of DDR1 and NRF2 have improved median survival compared to those whose tumours have high levels of cCol I, DDR1 and NRF2. Inhibition of the DDR1-stimulated expression of NF-κB or mitochondrial biogenesis blocks tumorigenesis in wild-type mice, but not in mice that express MMP-resistant Col I. The diverse effects of the tumour stroma on the growth and metastasis of PDAC and on the survival of patients are mediated through the Col I-DDR1-NF-κB-NRF2 mitochondrial biogenesis pathway, and targeting components of this pathway could provide therapeutic opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W4302028429,"RNA is a central and universal mediator of genetic information underlying the diversity of cell types and cell states, which together shape tissue organization and organismal function across species and lifespans. Despite numerous advances in RNA sequencing technologies and the massive accumulation of transcriptome datasets across the life sciences1,2, the dearth of technologies that use RNAs to observe and manipulate cell types remains a bottleneck in biology and medicine. Here we describe CellREADR (Cell access through RNA sensing by Endogenous ADAR), a programmable RNA-sensing technology that leverages RNA editing mediated by ADAR to couple the detection of cell-defining RNAs with the translation of effector proteins. Viral delivery of CellREADR conferred specific cell-type access in mouse and rat brains and in ex vivo human brain tissues. Furthermore, CellREADR enabled the recording and control of specific types of neurons in behaving mice. CellREADR thus highlights the potential for RNA-based monitoring and editing of animal cells in ways that are specific, versatile, simple and generalizable across organ systems and species, with wide applications in biology, biotechnology and programmable RNA medicine."

https://openalex.org/W4302011090,"Networks of optical clocks find applications in precise navigation1,2, in efforts to redefine the fundamental unit of the 'second'3-6 and in gravitational tests7. As the frequency instability for state-of-the-art optical clocks has reached the 10-19 level8,9, the vision of a global-scale optical network that achieves comparable performances requires the dissemination of time and frequency over a long-distance free-space link with a similar instability of 10-19. However, previous attempts at free-space dissemination of time and frequency at high precision did not extend beyond dozens of kilometres10,11. Here we report time-frequency dissemination with an offset of 6.3 × 10-20 ± 3.4 × 10-19 and an instability of less than 4 × 10-19 at 10,000 s through a free-space link of 113 km. Key technologies essential to this achievement include the deployment of high-power frequency combs, high-stability and high-efficiency optical transceiver systems and efficient linear optical sampling. We observe that the stability we have reached is retained for channel losses up to 89 dB. The technique we report can not only be directly used in ground-based applications, but could also lay the groundwork for future satellite time-frequency dissemination."

https://openalex.org/W4302011144,"Loss of Paneth cells and their antimicrobial granules compromises the intestinal epithelial barrier and is associated with Crohn's disease, a major type of inflammatory bowel disease1-7. Non-classical lymphoid cells, broadly referred to as intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), intercalate the intestinal epithelium8,9. This anatomical position has implicated them as first-line defenders in resistance to infections, but their role in inflammatory disease pathogenesis requires clarification. The identification of mediators that coordinate crosstalk between specific IEL and epithelial subsets could provide insight into intestinal barrier mechanisms in health and disease. Here we show that the subset of IELs that express γ and δ T cell receptor subunits (γδ IELs) promotes the viability of Paneth cells deficient in the Crohn's disease susceptibility gene ATG16L1. Using an ex vivo lymphocyte-epithelium co-culture system, we identified apoptosis inhibitor 5 (API5) as a Paneth cell-protective factor secreted by γδ IELs. In the Atg16l1-mutant mouse model, viral infection induced a loss of Paneth cells and enhanced susceptibility to intestinal injury by inhibiting the secretion of API5 from γδ IELs. Therapeutic administration of recombinant API5 protected Paneth cells in vivo in mice and ex vivo in human organoids with the ATG16L1 risk allele. Thus, we identify API5 as a protective γδ IEL effector that masks genetic susceptibility to Paneth cell death."
https://openalex.org/W4302011104,"Deoxyribonucleic acid in eukaryotes wraps around the histone octamer to form nucleosomes1, the fundamental unit of chromatin. The N termini of histone H4 interact with nearby nucleosomes and play an important role in the formation of high-order chromatin structure and heterochromatin silencing2-4. NuA4 in yeast and its homologue Tip60 complex in mammalian cells are the key enzymes that catalyse H4 acetylation, which in turn regulates chromatin packaging and function in transcription activation and DNA repair5-10. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of NuA4 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae bound to the nucleosome. NuA4 comprises two major modules: the catalytic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) module and the transcription activator-binding (TRA) module. The nucleosome is mainly bound by the HAT module and is positioned close to a polybasic surface of the TRA module, which is important for the optimal activity of NuA4. The nucleosomal linker DNA carrying the upstream activation sequence is oriented towards the conserved, transcription activator-binding surface of the Tra1 subunit, which suggests a potential mechanism of NuA4 to act as a transcription co-activator. The HAT module recognizes the disk face of the nucleosome through the H2A-H2B acidic patch and nucleosomal DNA, projecting the catalytic pocket of Esa1 to the N-terminal tail of H4 and supporting its function in selective acetylation of H4. Together, our findings illustrate how NuA4 is assembled and provide mechanistic insights into nucleosome recognition and transcription co-activation by a HAT."
https://openalex.org/W4302010824,"Abstract Cloud reflectivity is sensitive to atmospheric aerosol concentrations because aerosols provide the condensation nuclei on which water condenses 1 . Increased aerosol concentrations due to human activity affect droplet number concentration, liquid water and cloud fraction 2 , but these changes are subject to large uncertainties 3 . Ship tracks, long lines of polluted clouds that are visible in satellite images, are one of the main tools for quantifying aerosol–cloud interactions 4 . However, only a small fraction of the clouds polluted by shipping show ship tracks 5,6 . Here we show that even when no ship tracks are visible in satellite images, aerosol emissions change cloud properties substantially. We develop a new method to quantify the effect of shipping on all clouds, showing a cloud droplet number increase and a more positive liquid water response when there are no visible tracks. We directly detect shipping-induced cloud property changes in the trade cumulus regions of the Atlantic, which are known to display almost no visible tracks. Our results indicate that previous studies of ship tracks were suffering from selection biases by focusing only on visible tracks from satellite imagery. The strong liquid water path response we find translates to a larger aerosol cooling effect on the climate, potentially masking a higher climate sensitivity than observed temperature trends would otherwise suggest."

https://openalex.org/W4302011066,"Directed evolution is a powerful tool for improving existing properties and imparting completely new functionalities to proteins1–4. Nonetheless, its potential in even small proteins is inherently limited by the astronomical number of possible amino acid sequences. Sampling the complete sequence space of a 100-residue protein would require testing of 20100 combinations, which is beyond any existing experimental approach. In practice, selective modification of relatively few residues is sufficient for efficient improvement, functional enhancement and repurposing of existing proteins5. Moreover, computational methods have been developed to predict the locations and, in certain cases, identities of potentially productive mutations6–9. Importantly, all current approaches for prediction of hot spots and productive mutations rely heavily on structural information and/or bioinformatics, which is not always available for proteins of interest. Moreover, they offer a limited ability to identify beneficial mutations far from the active site, even though such changes may markedly improve the catalytic properties of an enzyme10. Machine learning methods have recently showed promise in predicting productive mutations11, but they frequently require large, high-quality training datasets, which are difficult to obtain in directed evolution experiments. Here we show that mutagenic hot spots in enzymes can be identified using NMR spectroscopy. In a proof-of-concept study, we converted myoglobin, a non-enzymatic oxygen storage protein, into a highly efficient Kemp eliminase using only three mutations. The observed levels of catalytic efficiency exceed those of proteins designed using current approaches and are similar with those of natural enzymes for the reactions that they are evolved to catalyse. Given the simplicity of this experimental approach, which requires no a priori structural or bioinformatic knowledge, we expect it to be widely applicable and to enable the full potential of directed enzyme evolution. NMR spectroscopy has been used to guide the directed evolution of myoglobin to a Kemp eliminase with high catalytic efficiency, outlining an approach that is likely to be generally applicable to other enzyme activities."
https://openalex.org/W4302011145,"A red giant star is an evolved low- or intermediate-mass star that has exhausted its central hydrogen content, leaving a helium core and a hydrogen-burning shell. Oscillations of stars can be observed as periodic dimmings and brightenings in the optical light curves. In red giant stars, non-radial acoustic waves couple to gravity waves and give rise to mixed modes, which behave as pressure modes in the envelope and gravity modes in the core. These modes have previously been used to measure the internal rotation of red giants1,2, leading to the conclusion that purely hydrodynamical processes of angular momentum transport from the core are too inefficient3. Magnetic fields could produce the additional required transport4-6. However, owing to the lack of direct measurements of magnetic fields in stellar interiors, little is currently known about their properties. Asteroseismology can provide direct detection of magnetic fields because, like rotation, the fields induce shifts in the oscillation mode frequencies7-12. Here we report the measurement of magnetic fields in the cores of three red giant stars observed with the Kepler13 satellite. The fields induce shifts that break the symmetry of dipole mode multiplets. We thus measure field strengths ranging from about 30 kilogauss to about 100 kilogauss in the vicinity of the hydrogen-burning shell and place constraints on the field topology."
https://openalex.org/W4302010785,"Long-term stress on marine organisms from ocean acidification will differ between seasons. As atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) increases, so do seasonal variations of ocean CO2 partial pressure ([Formula: see text]), causing summer and winter long-term trends to diverge1-5. Trends may be further influenced by an unexplored factor-changes in the seasonal timing of [Formula: see text]. In Arctic Ocean surface waters, the observed timing is typified by a winter high and summer low6 because biological effects dominate thermal effects. Here we show that 27 Earth system models simulate similar timing under historical forcing but generally project that the summer low, relative to the annual mean, eventually becomes a high across much of the Arctic Ocean under mid-to-high-level CO2 emissions scenarios. Often the greater increase in summer [Formula: see text], although gradual, abruptly inverses the chronological order of the annual high and low, a phenomenon not previously seen in climate-related variables. The main cause is the large summer sea surface warming7 from earlier retreat of seasonal sea ice8. Warming and changes in other drivers enhance this century's increase in extreme summer [Formula: see text] by 29 ± 9 per cent compared with no change in driver seasonalities. Thus the timing change worsens summer ocean acidification, which in turn may lower the tolerance of endemic marine organisms to increasing summer temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W4302010970,"Pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight, were key components of Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems from their sudden appearance in the Late Triassic until their demise at the end of the Cretaceous1-6. However, the origin and early evolution of pterosaurs are poorly understood owing to a substantial stratigraphic and morphological gap between these reptiles and their closest relatives6, Lagerpetidae7. Scleromochlus taylori, a tiny reptile from the early Late Triassic of Scotland discovered over a century ago, was hypothesized to be a key taxon closely related to pterosaurs8, but its poor preservation has limited previous studies and resulted in controversy over its phylogenetic position, with some even doubting its identification as an archosaur9. Here we use microcomputed tomographic scans to provide the first accurate whole-skeletal reconstruction and a revised diagnosis of Scleromochlus, revealing new anatomical details that conclusively identify it as a close pterosaur relative1 within Pterosauromorpha (the lagerpetid + pterosaur clade). Scleromochlus is anatomically more similar to lagerpetids than to pterosaurs and retains numerous features that were probably present in very early diverging members of Avemetatarsalia (bird-line archosaurs). These results support the hypothesis that the first flying reptiles evolved from tiny, probably facultatively bipedal, cursorial ancestors1."
https://openalex.org/W4302010897,"Of more than a thousand known cataclysmic variables (CVs), where a white dwarf is accreting from a hydrogen-rich star, only a dozen have orbital periods below 75 minutes1–9. One way to achieve these short periods requires the donor star to have undergone substantial nuclear evolution before interacting with the white dwarf10–14, and it is expected that these objects will transition to helium accretion. These transitional CVs have been proposed as progenitors of helium CVs13–18. However, no known transitional CV is expected to reach an orbital period short enough to account for most of the helium CV population, leaving the role of this evolutionary pathway unclear. Here we report observations of ZTF J1813+4251, a 51-minute-orbital-period, fully eclipsing binary system consisting of a star with a temperature comparable to that of the Sun but a density 100 times greater owing to its helium-rich composition, accreting onto a white dwarf. Phase-resolved spectra, multi-band light curves and the broadband spectral energy distribution allow us to obtain precise and robust constraints on the masses, radii and temperatures of both components. Evolutionary modelling shows that ZTF J1813+4251 is destined to become a helium CV binary, reaching an orbital period under 20 minutes, rendering ZTF J1813+4251 a previously missing link between helium CV binaries and hydrogen-rich CVs. A 51-minute-orbital-period, fully eclipsing binary system consisting of a star with a comparable temperature to that of the Sun but a 100 times greater density, accreting onto a white dwarf is reported."
https://openalex.org/W4302276019,"The schizophoran superfamily Ephydroidea (Diptera: Cyclorrhapha) includes eight families, ranging from the well-known vinegar flies (Drosophilidae) and shore flies (Ephydridae), to several small, relatively unusual groups, the phylogenetic placement of which has been particularly challenging for systematists. An extraordinary diversity in life histories, feeding habits and morphology are a hallmark of fly biology, and the Ephydroidea are no exception. Extreme specialization can lead to “orphaned” taxa with no clear evidence for their phylogenetic position. To resolve relationships among a diverse sample of Ephydroidea, including the highly modified flies in the families Braulidae and Mormotomyiidae, we conducted phylogenomic sampling. Using exon capture from Anchored Hybrid Enrichment and transcriptomics to obtain 320 orthologous nuclear genes sampled for 32 species of Ephydroidea and 11 outgroups, we evaluate a new phylogenetic hypothesis for representatives of the superfamily. These data strongly support monophyly of Ephydroidea with Ephydridae as an early branching radiation and the placement of Mormotomyiidae as a family-level lineage sister to all remaining families. We confirm placement of Cryptochetidae as sister taxon to a large clade containing both Drosophilidae and Braulidae–the latter a family of honeybee ectoparasites. Our results reaffirm that sampling of both taxa and characters is critical in hyperdiverse clades and that these factors have a major influence on phylogenomic reconstruction of the history of the schizophoran fly radiation."
https://openalex.org/W4302363755,"The primary objective of this pilot study was to investigate the feasibility of regular consumption of fermented vegetables for six weeks on markers of inflammation and the composition of the gut microflora in women (clinical trials ID: NTC03407794). Thirty-one women were randomized into one of three groups: 100 g/day of fermented vegetables (group A), 100 g/day pickled vegetables (group B), or no vegetables (group C) for six weeks. Dietary intake was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire and blood and stool samples were provided before and after the intervention for measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP). Next-generation sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Participants' ages ranged between 18 and 69 years. Both groups A and B had a mean daily consumption of 91g of vegetables for 32 and 36 days, respectively. Serum CRP ranged between 0.9 and 265 ng/mL (SD = 92.4) at baseline, while TNF-α and LBP concentrations ranged between 0 and 9 pg/mL (SD = 2.3), and 7 and 29 μg/mL (SD = 4.4), respectively. There were no significant changes in levels of inflammatory markers among groups. At timepoint 2, group A showed an increase in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P = 0.022), a decrease in Ruminococcus torques (P<0.05), and a trend towards greater alpha diversity measured by the Shannon index (P = 0.074). The findings indicate that consumption of ~100 g/day of fermented vegetables for six weeks is feasible and may result in beneficial changes in the composition of the gut microbiota. Future trials should determine whether consumption of fermented vegetables is an effective strategy against gut dysbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W4302363661,"As of today, surprisingly little is known about the subjective well-being of faculty in general, but especially when teaching online and during a time of pandemic during lockdowns in particular. To narrow this research gap, the present study systematically compared the subjective well-being of faculty teaching face-to-face before to those teaching online during the COVID-19 pandemic, adopting a self-determination theory framework. The data reported here stem from a study conducted before the pandemic (Sample 1, n = 101) and which repeated-measures survey design we replicated to collect corresponding data during the pandemic (Sample 2, n = 71). Results showed that faculty teaching online during the pandemic reported impaired satisfaction of all three basic needs, that is reduced autonomy, competence, and especially relatedness, as well as impaired subjective well-being (clearly reduced enjoyment and reduced teaching satisfaction; increased anger and a tendency towards more shame) compared to faculty teaching face-to-face before the pandemic. Yet pride, anxiety, and boredom were experienced to a similar extent across both samples. The effects of the teaching format on the different aspects of subjective well-being were overall mediated in self-determination-theory-congruent ways by the satisfaction of the basic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. We conclude for a post-pandemic future that online teaching will supplement rather than replace face-to-face teaching in higher education institutions, as their importance for building relationships and satisfying social interactions not only for students but also for faculty seem to have been underestimated so far."

We determined the potential value of NLR and serum creatinine as predictors of disease severity and mortality in COVID-19.Prospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted to premier COVID-19 treatment hospitals in Ethiopia. Predictive capability of biomarkers in progression and prognosis of COVID-19 was analyzed using receiver operating characteristics. Survival of COVID-19 patients with different biomarker levels was computed. Logistic regression assessed associations between disease severity and mortality on NLR and serum creatinine adjusted for odds ratio (AOR).The study enrolled 126 adults with severe (n = 68) or mild/moderate (n = 58) COVID-19, with median age 50 [interquartile range (IQR 20-86)]; 57.1% males. The NLR value was significantly higher in severe cases [6.68 (IQR 3.03-12.21)] compared to the mild/moderate [3.23 (IQR 2.09-5.39)], with the NLR value markedly associated with disease severity (p<0.001). Mortality was higher in severe cases [13 (19.1%)] compared to mild/moderate cases [2 (3.4%)] (p = 0.007). The NLR value was significantly higher in non-survivors [15.17 (IQR 5.13-22.5)] compared to survivors [4.26 (IQR 2.40-7.90)] (p = 0.002). Serum creatinine was significantly elevated in severe cases [34 (50%)] compared with mild/moderate [11 (19%)] (p<0.001). Disease severity [AOR 6.58, 95%CI (1.29-33.56), p = 0.023] and NLR [AOR 1.07, 95%CI (1.02-1.12), p = 0.004)] might be associated with death. NLR had a sensitivity and specificity of 69.1% and 60.3% as predictor of disease severity (cut-off >4.08), and 86.7% and 55.9% as prognostic marker of mortality (cut-off >4.63).In COVID-19, NLR is a biomarker with only modest accuracy for predicting disease severity and mortality. Still, patients with NLR >4.63 are more likely to die. Monitoring of this biomarker at the earliest stage of the disease may predict outcome. Additionally, high creatinine seems related to disease severity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4299348881,"Cancer cells have distinctive demands for intermediates from glucose metabolism for biosynthesis and energy in different cell cycle phases. However, how cell cycle regulators and glycolytic enzymes coordinate to orchestrate the essential metabolic processes are still poorly characterized. Here, we report a novel interaction between the mitotic kinase, Aurora A, and the glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), in the interphase of the cell cycle. We found Aurora A-mediated phosphorylation of PKM2 at threonine 45. This phosphorylation significantly attenuated PKM2 enzymatic activity by reducing its tetramerization and also promoted glycolytic flux and the branching anabolic pathways. Replacing the endogenous PKM2 with a nonphosphorylated PKM2 T45A mutant inhibited glycolysis, glycolytic branching pathways, and tumor growth in both in vitro and in vivo models. Together, our study revealed a new protumor function of Aurora A through modulating a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, PKM2, mainly during the S phase of the cell cycle. Our findings also showed that although both Aurora A and Aurora B kinase phosphorylate PKM2 at the same residue, the spatial and temporal regulations of the specific kinase and PKM2 interaction are context dependent, indicating intricate interconnectivity between cell cycle and glycolytic regulators."
https://openalex.org/W4301430941,"Abstract Mutations in the estrogen receptor (ESR1) gene are common in ER-positive breast cancer patients who progress on endocrine therapies. Most mutations localise to just three residues at, or near, the C-terminal helix 12 of the hormone binding domain, at leucine-536, tyrosine-537 and aspartate-538. To investigate these mutations, we have used CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome engineering to generate a comprehensive set of isogenic mutant breast cancer cell lines. Our results confirm that L536R, Y537C, Y537N, Y537S and D538G mutations confer estrogen-independent growth in breast cancer cells. Growth assays show mutation-specific reductions in sensitivities to drugs representing three classes of clinical anti-estrogens. These differential mutation- and drug-selectivity profiles have implications for treatment choices following clinical emergence of ER mutations. Our results further suggest that mutant expression levels may be determinants of the degree of resistance to some anti-estrogens. Differential gene expression analysis demonstrates up-regulation of estrogen-responsive genes, as expected, but also reveals that enrichment for interferon-regulated gene expression is a common feature of all mutations. Finally, a new gene signature developed from the gene expression profiles in ER mutant cells predicts clinical response in breast cancer patients with ER mutations."
https://openalex.org/W4302012063,"Measurement of care quality and safety mainly relies on abstracted administrative data. However, it is well studied that administrative data-based adverse event (AE) detection methods are suboptimal due to lack of clinical information. Electronic medical records (EMR) have been widely implemented and contain detailed and comprehensive information regarding all aspects of patient care, offering a valuable complement to administrative data. Harnessing the rich clinical data in EMRs offers a unique opportunity to improve detection, identify possible risk factors of AE and enhance surveillance. However, the methodological tools for detection of AEs within EMR need to be developed and validated. The objectives of this study are to develop EMR-based AE algorithms from hospital EMR data and assess AE algorithm's validity in Canadian EMR data.Patient EMR structured and text data from acute care hospitals in Calgary, Alberta, Canada will be linked with discharge abstract data (DAD) between 2010 and 2020 (n~1.5 million). AE algorithms development. First, a comprehensive list of AEs will be generated through a systematic literature review and expert recommendations. Second, these AEs will be mapped to EMR free texts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. Finally, an expert panel will assess the clinical relevance of the developed NLP algorithms. AE algorithms validation: We will test the newly developed AE algorithms on 10,000 randomly selected EMRs between 2010 to 2020 from Calgary, Alberta. Trained reviewers will review the selected 10,000 EMR charts to identify AEs that had occurred during hospitalization. Performance indicators (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F1 score, etc.) of the developed AE algorithms will be assessed using chart review data as the reference standard.The results of this project can be widely implemented in EMR based healthcare system to accurately and timely detect in-hospital AEs."
https://openalex.org/W4302761282,"Aim To determine acceptable limits of communication delays in telesurgery, we investigated the impact of communication delays under a dynamic environment using a surgical assist robot. Previous studies have evaluated acceptable delays under static environments. Effects of delays may be enhanced in dynamic environments, but studies have not yet focused on this point. Methods Thirty-four subjects with different surgical experience (Group1: no surgical experience; Group2: only laparoscopic surgical experience; Group3: robotic surgery experience) performed 4 tasks under different delays (0, 70, 100, 150, 200, or 300 ms) using a surgical assist robot. Task accomplishment time and total movement distance of forceps were recorded and compared under different communication delays of 0–300 ms. In addition, surgical performance was compared between Group1or Group2 without delay and Group3 with communication delays. Results Significant differences in task accomplishment time were found between delays of 0 and 70 ms, but not between delays of 70 and 100 ms. Thereafter, the greater the communication delay, the longer the task accomplishment time. Similar results were obtained in total movement distance of forceps. Comparisons between Group3 with delay and Group1 or Group2 without delay demonstrated that surgical performance in Group3 with delay was superior or equal to that of Group1 or Group2 without delay as long as the delay was 100 ms or less. Conclusions Communication delays in telesurgery may be acceptable if 100 ms or less. Experienced surgeons with more than 100 ms of delay could outperform less-experienced surgeons without delay."
https://openalex.org/W4302761388,"Introduction Previously developed cesarean section (CS) and emergency CS prediction tools use antenatal and intrapartum risk factors. We aimed to develop a predictive model for the risk of emergency CS before the onset of labour utilizing antenatal obstetric and non-obstetric factors. Methods We completed a secondary analysis of data collected from the CHILD Cohort Study. The analysis was limited to term (≥37 weeks), singleton pregnant women with cephalic presentation. The sample was divided into a training and validation dataset. The emergency CS prediction model was developed in the training dataset and the performance accuracy was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve(AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC). Our final model was subsequently evaluated in the validation dataset. Results The participant sample consisted of 2,836 pregnant women. Mean age of participants was 32 years, mean BMI of 25.4 kg/m2 and 39% were nulliparous. 14% had emergency CS delivery. Each year of increasing maternal age increased the odds of emergency CS by 6% (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR 1.06,1.02–1.08). Likewise, there was a 4% increase odds of emergency CS for each unit increase in BMI (aOR 1.04,1.02–1.06). In contrast, increase in maternal height has a negative association with emergency CS. The final emergency CS delivery predictive model included six variables (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, antenatal depression, previous vaginal delivery, age, height, BMI). The AUC for our final prediction model was 0.74 (0.72–0.77) in the training set with a similar AUC in the validation dataset (0.77; 0.71–0.82). Conclusion The developed and validated emergency CS delivery prediction model can be used in counselling prospective parents around their CS risk and healthcare resource planning. Further validation of the tool is suggested."

Itaconic acid competitively inhibits the first enzyme of the bacterial glyoxylate cycle. To overcome itaconic acid stress, bacteria employ the bacterial LysR-type transcriptional regulator RipR. However, it remains unknown which molecule activates RipR in bacterial pathogenesis. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the regulatory domain of RipR from the intracellular pathogen Salmonella. The RipR regulatory domain structure exhibited the typical dimeric arrangement with the putative ligand-binding site between the two subdomains. Our isothermal titration calorimetry experiments identified isocitrate as the physiological ligand of RipR, whose intracellular level is increased in response to itaconic acid stress. We further found that 3-phenylpropionic acid significantly decreased the resistance of the bacteria to an itaconic acid challenge. Consistently, the complex structure revealed that the compound is antagonistically bound to the RipR ligand-binding site.

This study provides the molecular basis of bacterial survival in itaconic acid stress from our immune systems. Further studies are required to reveal biochemical activity, which would elucidate how Salmonella survives in macrophage phagosomes by defending against itaconic acid inhibition of bacterial metabolism. Macrophages are activated upon inflammatory signals, such as the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide, and kill the invading bacteria in their phagosome with diverse antimicrobial substances, such as H2O2 and HOCl (1David S.

Bacterial adaptation to oxidative stress: implications for pathogenesis and interaction with phagocytic cells.FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2574-2582Google Scholar). Itaconic acid (2-methylenesuccinic acid), an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, was recently noted as a new antibacterial substance in the macrophage phagosome (3Cordes T. Michelucci A. Hiller K. Itaconic acid: the surprising role of an industrial compound as a mammalian antimicrobial metabolite.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2015; 35: 451-473Google Scholar). Itaconic acid is generated from the precursor cis-aconitate by the enzymatic activity of the immune-responsive gene 1 (Irg1) gene product, which is the most highly upregulated by the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide in macrophages (3Cordes T.

The antimicrobial activity of itaconic acid results from the inhibition of bacterial isocitrate lyase, which catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to glyoxylate and succinate as the key enzyme in the glyoxylate shunt pathway or the glyoxylate cycle (10McFadden B.A. Purohit S. Itaconate, an isocitrate lyase-directed inhibitor in Pseudomonas indigofera.J. Bacteriol. 1977; 131: 136-144Google Scholar). The glyoxylate cycle is widely found in bacteria, protists, fungi, and plants as a variation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (11Chew S.Y. Chee W.J.Y. Than L.T.L.

Elsevier, Oxford2021: 220-229Google Scholar). The glyoxylate cycle saves two carbons by bypassing the two decarboxylation reactions (isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate and α-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA) in the TCA cycle and thus is usually employed under limiting carbon source conditions (13Cronan Jr., J.E. Laporte D. Tricarboxylic acid cycle and glyoxylate bypass.EcoSal Plus. 2005; 1Google Scholar).Gram-negative bacteria have LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) to properly regulate gene expression by recognizing signaling molecules in response to diverse environmental and physiological stimuli (14Lahiri A. Das P. Chakravortty D. Salmonella Typhimurium: insight into the multi-faceted role of the LysR-type transcriptional regulators in Salmonella.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 2129-2133Google Scholar). LTTRs consist of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the C-terminal regulatory domain (RD) exhibiting typical asymmetric tetrameric assembly (15Maddocks S.E. Oyston P.C.F. Structure and function of the LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) family proteins.Microbiology (Reading). 2008; 154: 3609-3623Google Scholar). Binding of the cognate ligands to the RD triggers the changes in transcriptional activity via structural changes in the tetrameric assembly (16Jo I. Chung I.Y. Bae H.W. Kim J.S. Song S. Cho Y.H. et al.Structural details of the OxyR peroxide-sensing mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 6443-6448Google Scholar, 17Jo I. Kim D. No T. Hong S. Ahn J.

The LTTR RipR was identified as the vital component of the resistance to the antimicrobial function of itaconic acid in many gram-negative pathogenic bacteria (18Hersch S.J. Navarre W.W. The Salmonella LysR family regulator RipR activates the SPI-13-encoded itaconate degradation cluster.Infect. Immun. 2020; 88Google Scholar). RipR activated the expression of the three enzymes ripC, ripB, and ripA, which degrade itaconic acid in many other pathogens including Yersinia pestis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Salmonella enterica (3Cordes T.

The Salmonella LysR family regulator RipR activates the SPI-13-encoded itaconate degradation cluster.Infect. Immun. 2020; 88Google Scholar). RipR contributed to the bacterial resistance to itaconic acids in S. enterica and Y. pestis (18Hersch S.J. Navarre W.W.

Bacterial itaconate degradation promotes pathogenicity.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10: 371-377Google Scholar). RipR has DBD and RD similar to those of other LTTRs and is expected to form a tetrameric assembly similar to that of like typical LTTRs.This study focuses on the food poisoning bacterium S. enterica, which can survive in macrophage phagosomes through diverse mechanisms (21Ren J. Sang Y. Ni J. Tao J. Lu J. Zhao M. et al.Acetylation regulates survival of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium under acid stress.Appl. Environ.

S. enterica has the transcriptional activator RipR to cope with the itaconic acid stress present in macrophage phagosomes. However, it remains unknown which molecule activates RipR in the defense against the itaconic acid challenge in the macrophage phagosomes. Herein, we determine the crystal structure of the RipR RD and discover the cognate ligand molecules of RipR. We further found that plant-derived secondary metabolites inhibit the RipR function.ResultsCrystal structure of S. Typhimurium ligand-free RipR RDWe expressed the RD (residues 87–292) of RipR from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) in the Escherichia coli expression system. The purified protein was crystallized in the space group of P21, and its crystal structure was determined at 2.3 Å resolution by the molecular replacement method.

Size-exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering confirmed the homodimer in the solution state, as observed in many LTTR RDs (Fig. S1).Similar to typical LTTR RDs, the RipR RD is further divided into the two subdomains RD-I and RD-II. RD-I from one protomer interacts with RD-II from the other protomer in the homodimeric arrangement (Fig. 1A). The RD of the benzoate and cis-cis-muconate–responsive LTTR BenM was discovered as the top structural ortholog of RipR RD using the FoldSeek server (rmsd 1.536 Å; Table 1), which is a specialized program to search the structural homologs by sensitive comparisons of large structure sets (30van Kempen M.

The structural superposition on the ligand-bound structures of the BenM RD suggested the putative ligand-binding site of RipR RD in the space between the two subdomains RD-I and RD-II (Fig. 2). Our RipR RD structure seemed to be a ligand-free structure, since no extra electron density map was found in the putative ligand-binding pocket of RipR RD.Table 1Results of a Foldseek search with the RipR structurePDB IDScoreE-valuesSequence identity (%)Gene IDDescriptionOligomer state2H9B7874.292e-2025.4BenM from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 (R156H/T157S)LysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomodimer2F787759.231e-2025.7BenM with its effector benzoate from Acinetobacter baylyiLysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomodimer2F7A7721.118e-1925.7BenM with its effector cis, cis-muconate from Acinetobacter baylyiLysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomodimer2H997691.354e-1925.7BenM from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 (R156H, T157S)LysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomodimer2F977641.863e-1925.7BenM from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 (high pH)LysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomodimer2F6G7553.308e-1924.7BenM from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1LysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomodimer3GLB7533.758e-1924.7CatM from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 (R156H)LysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomodimer2H987427.584e-1925.7CatM from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 (V158M)LysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomodimer3K1N7418.084e-1925.7BenM from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 (full-length)LysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomodimer3K1P7331.347e-1824.6BenM from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 (E226K) (full-length)LysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomodimer2F7C7271.975e-1824.7CatM with its effector cis, cis-muconate from Acinetobacter baylyiLysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomodimer1IXC6892.233e-1721.6CbnR from Cupriavidus necatorLysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomotetramer6G1D6882.380e-1724.1OxyR from Corynebacterium glutamicumLysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomotetramer2HXR6803.966e-1723CynR from Escherichia coli K-12Probable transcriptional regulatorHomodimer5TED6784.505e-1721.9QuiR with shikimate from Listeria monocytogenes EGD-eLysR-type transcriptional regulatorHomotrimer Open table in a new tab Figure 2Structural comparison of RipR RD to ligand-free and ligand-bound BenM RDs.

In particular, the Arg residue corresponding to Arg148 makes the ionic interaction with the carboxylic acid of the bound cis-cis-muconate in the BenM RD (PDB code: 2F7A; Fig. 2). Thus, these findings suggest that the cognate ligand of the RipR RD contains carboxylic acid moieties similar to those in the BenM RD ligand cis-cis-muconate.Isocitrate as the cognate ligand of RipRTo determine whether RipR of S. Typhimurium is responsive to the itaconic acid treatment, we treated S. Typhimurium with itaconic acid and investigated the transcription of the ripCBA, whose transcription is induced by RipR. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that the treatment of itaconic acid to the bacteria increased the expression levels of ripCBA by over 200-fold, confirming the role of RipR (18Hersch S.J.

We measured the binding affinities of the compounds to the RipR RD proteins using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0). The ITC thermograms showed that isocitrate is strongly bound to the RipR RD with a submicromolar Kd value (0.31 μM) and a stoichiometry of 0.5 binding sites per RD monomer (Fig. 3B). The heat from the binding of isocitrate was large (Fig. 3B), which was unusually high and further indicated that many interactions were newly generated by isocitrate binding. In contrast, itaconic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, oxaloacetate, and cis-aconitate did not give compelling results for binding to the RipR RD in the ITC experiments (Fig. S3).Figure 4Conformational changes upon isocitrate binding.

Unfortunately, isocitrate seemed to hamper the cocrystallization of the protein and did not allow binding by soaking into the ligand-free crystals. We instead docked an isocitrate molecule on the putative ligand-binding site of the RipR RD in silico by AutoDock Vina in PyRx (32Dallakyan S. Olson A.J. Small-molecule library screening by docking with PyRx.Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1263: 243-250Google Scholar) (Fig. S4A). The Gromacs program further minimized the energy of the docked structure, which depicted the isocitrate-bound ligand-binding site (Fig. 4A). The isocitrate molecule interacts with the side-chains of Glu127, Ile200, Thr98, Ala99, Ser100, Arg148, and Pro226 on the solvent-accessible ligand-binding pocket of RipR RD in the docked structure (Fig. S4B). In particular, Arg148 makes ionic interactions with a carboxylic acid moiety of isocitrate, as predicted by structural comparison to the cis-cis-muconate–bound BenM structure (Figs. 2B and 4A). When the in-silico docking model was compared with the ligand-free crystal structure, substantial structural changes were not observed, which was not surprising because the AutoDock Vina and the energy minimization function in Gromacs did not allow a large conformational change of the receptor proteins (Fig. S4A).When we compared the elution volumes of the RipR RD in the buffer with and without isocitrate in the size-exclusion chromatography, isocitrate increased the elution volume of the RipR RD (Fig. S5). These findings indicate that isocitrate binding makes the conformation of RipR RD more compact, as observed in many ligand-bound LTTR RDs. To analyze the structural change of the RipR RD dimer upon isocitrate binding, we performed the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with the docked structure using the Gromacs program, which is widely used in MD for biomolecules (33Pronk S. Pall S. Schulz R. Larsson P. Bjelkmar P. Apostolov R. et al.Gromacs 4.5: a high-throughput and highly parallel open source molecular simulation toolkit.Bioinformatics. 2013; 29: 845-854Google Scholar). The molecular motions of the protein and the ligand were largely stopped in 200 ns during the MD simulation process. According to the MD simulation result, the isocitrate molecule in a subunit (chain B) was moved into the interior of RD-II by 8 Å (Fig. 4B), while the isocitrate molecule in the other subunit (chain A) of the RD dimer remained in the solvent-accessible ligand-binding pocket. A large rotational motion was observed in the chain B subunit when the chain A subunit was superposed as the reference, which may explain the high released heat upon isocitrate binding in the ITC experiments. The rotational motion resulted in a 9.7 Å movement of the N-terminal residue of the RD (Val92) in the MD simulation, which is connected to the DBD in the full-length model of RipR (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that isocitrate binding to the RD domains induces the transition from the inactive conformation to the active conformation by the movement of the DBDs in the tetrameric assembly of full-length RipR.We analyzed the MD simulation results focusing on how the changes in the isocitrate binding mode resulted in the conformational change of the RD domain. The α- and γ-carboxylic groups and the hydroxyl group of isocitrate mediate the interaction between RD-I and RD-II. The α-carboxylic acid group of isocitrate (pKa ∼ 7.0) formed hydrogen bonds with the backbone or side-chains of RD-I Ala99 and Glu127 and the α-hydroxyl group of isocitrate with the carbonyl group of Pro226 in RD-II. The γ-carboxylic group formed hydrogen bonds with RD-I Ser100, Arg148, and RD-II Ile200 (Fig. 4A). However, the isocitrate-mediated RD-I and RD-II interactions were shifted in the 200 ns structure, resulting in a rotational movement of the protomers in the dimeric assembly. The angle between one protomer and the other protomer of the isocitrate-bound RipR RD dimer was decreased by ∼22° compared to the starting structure at 0 ns (Fig. 4B). The carboxylic group at the α position makes interactions with Pro226 and Ile228 only in RD-II, and the γ-carboxylic group interacts with Leu202 of RD-II with the ionic interaction between the β-carboxylic group of isocitrate and Ser100 and Arg148 in RD-I (Fig. 4A). The distance of RD-I and RD-II at the ligand-binding site (10.6 Å between RD-I Ser100 and RD-II Pro226 Cα atoms) at 0 ns was decreased at the final structure at 20"

A series of in-person training programs were operated in collaboration with government and partner organizations for the healthcare workers (HCW) of Bangladesh. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of HCWs regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, their case management, infection prevention and control to fight against the ongoing pandemic.As a part of the National Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 in Bangladesh, the training program was conducted at four district-level hospitals and one specialized hospital in Bangladesh from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. A total of 755 HCWs participated in the training sessions. Among them, 357 (47%) were enrolled for the evaluation upon completion of the data, collected from one district hospital (Feni) and one specialized hospital (National Institute of Mental Health).The mean percentage of pre-test and post-test scores of all the participants were found to be 57% (95% CI 8.34-8.91; p 0.01) and 65% (95% CI 9.56-10.15; p <0.001) respectively. The difference of score (mean) between the groups was significant (p<0.001). After categorizing participants' knowledge levels as poor, average and fair, doctors' group has shown to have significant enhancement from level of average to fair compared to that of the nurses. Factors associated with knowledge augmentation of doctors were working in primary health care centers (aOR: 4.22; 95% CI: 1.80, 9.88), job experience less than 5 years (aOR: 4.10; 95% CI: 1.01, 16.63) and experience in caring of family member with COVID-19 morbidity (aOR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.03, 4.10), after adjusting for relevant covariates such as age, sex and prior COVID-19 illness.Considering the series of waves of COVID-19 pandemic with newer variants, the present paper underscores the importance of implementing the structured in-person training program on case management, infection prevention and control for the HCWs that may help for successful readiness prior to future pandemics that may further help to minimize the pandemic related fatal consequences."

Acceptance of the intervention is crucial. The Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) developed by Sekhon et al. (2017) describes the multiple facets of acceptance: Affective attitude, burden, perceived effectiveness, ethicality, intervention coherence, opportunity costs and self-efficacy. The aims of this study were to develop and assess the psychometric properties of a measurement scale for acceptance of a telephone-facilitated health coaching intervention, based on the TFA; and to determine the acceptability of the intervention among participants living with diabetes or having a high risk of diabetes in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas in Stockholm.This study was nested in the implementation trial SMART2D (Self-management approach and reciprocal learning for type 2 diabetes). The intervention consisted of nine telephone-facilitated health coaching sessions delivered individually over a 6-month period. The acceptability of the intervention was assessed using a questionnaire consisting of 19 Likert scale questions developed using Sekhon's TFA. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed.Ratings from 49 participants (19 with type 2 diabetes and 30 at high risk of developing diabetes) in ages 38-65 were analyzed. The EFA on the acceptability scale revealed three factors with acceptable reliabilities: affective attitude (alpha 0.90), coherence and understanding (alpha 0.77), perceived burden (alpha 0.85), explaining 82% of the variance. Positive affect and coherence had high median scores and small variance. Median score for perceived burden was low, but with significant variance due to younger individuals and those at high risk reporting higher burden.The telephone-facilitated health coaching intervention was perceived as acceptable by the study population using a questionnaire based on Sekhon's TFA, with a wider variation in perceived burden seen among high risk and younger participants."

Therefore, it is necessary to clinically detect PPA for glaucoma diagnosis. This study was aimed at developing a detection method for PPA using fundus images with deep learning algorithms to be used by ophthalmologists or optometrists for screening purposes. The model was developed based on localization for the region of interest (ROI) using a mask region-based convolutional neural networks R-CNN and a classification network for the presence of PPA using CNN deep learning algorithms. A total of 2,472 images, obtained from five public sources and one Saudi-based resource (King Abdullah International Medical Research Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia), were used to train and test the model. First the images from public sources were analyzed, followed by those from local sources, and finally, images from both sources were analyzed together. In testing the classification model, the area under the curve’s (AUC) scores of 0.83, 0.89, and 0.87 were obtained for the local, public, and combined sets, respectively. The developed model will assist in diagnosing glaucoma in screening programs; however, more research is needed on segmenting the PPA boundaries for more detailed PPA detection, which can be combined with optic disc and cup boundaries to calculate the cup-to-disc ratio."

However, research on the relationship between political participation and the life satisfaction of Chinese urban residents is relatively scarce. Thus, this study investigates whether political participation helps improve the life satisfaction of Chinese urban residents. Based on 2577 samples of the 2015 Chinese Social Survey this study used the Ordinary least squares model, instrumental variable model, and propensity score matching model to explore the relationship between political participation and the life satisfaction of Chinese urban residents. The empirical results show that political participation can significantly improve the life satisfaction of urban residents. Compared with urban residents without political participation, the life satisfaction of the political participants was 0.145 units higher at a 0.05 level of significance. In addition, this improved effect varied in degree among different groups of urban residents and was more significant for females, members of the Communist Party of China, highly educated, and employed urban residents. In China, there is a significant relationship between political participation and the life satisfaction of urban residents, with the life satisfaction of urban residents improving significantly through political participation. There are differences in the level of this improved effect among different urban residents, and it is more significant for females, highly educated, members of the Communist Party, and employed urban residents. To improve the life satisfaction of Chinese urban residents, it is necessary to further broaden their political participation channels."

A link between depression, dyspepsia and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has previously been reported. However, there is limited data regarding the association between these conditions from sub-Saharan Africa where they are highly prevalent.This study aimed at elucidating the potential associations between depression, dyspepsia and H. pylori infection in Ethiopia.We conducted a community based cross-sectional study involving urban and rural residents aged 13 years or older in Jimma Zone, southwest Ethiopia. A total of 871 participants were evaluated using a structured case reporting format for symptoms of dyspepsia and the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression. Additionally, participants were assessed for H. pylori infection using stool antigen and serology tests. A multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the association between depression, dyspepsia and H. pylori infection after controlling for potential confounders.The prevalence of PHQ-9 scores indicative of probable case of depression among all participants was 10.9%. The prevalence of probable case of depression among patients who had at least one symptom of dyspepsia was 13.3% (X2 = 15.1 = p-value<0.001), while it was 11.9% (X2 = 1.23, p-value = 0.26) among patients who had H. pylori infection. Out of patients who took medications for their heartburn in the past 30 days, 14.9% (X2 = 3.6, p-value = 0.06) had probable case of depression.

https://openalex.org/W4302760881,"Glaucoma disease is characterized by an increased intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucomatous alterations of the optic disc and corresponding visual field defects. Even lowering the main risk factor IOP until an individual target level does not prevent this neurodegenerative disorder from proceeding. Several autoimmune mechanisms were discovered, partly showing a functionality. One of these autoimmune phenomena targets the ß2-adrenergic receptor (ß2-AR; i.e. agonistic autoantibodies; ß2-agAAb) and is linked to an elevated IOP and an impaired retinal microcirculation. As neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is postulated to share a common molecular mechanism with glaucoma. In the present study we investigated autoimmune phenomena targeting the ß2-AR in patients with AD. Sera of the patients were analyzed in a rat cardiomyocyte bioassay for the presence of functional autoantibodies against ß2-AR. In addition, different species of amyloid beta (Aß) monomers were tested (Aß1-14, Aß10-25, Aβ10–37 Aß1-40, Aß1-42, Aβ28–40, and Aß-[Pyr]3–43). Our results demonstrate that none of the short-chain Aß (Aß1-14, Aß10-25, or Aβ28–40) showed any agonistic or inhibitory effect on ß2-AR. Contrary, long-chain Aß-[Pyr]3–43, representing a major neurogenic plaque component, exerted an activation that after blocking by the ß2-AR antagonist ICI118.551, could be identified as that the effect was realized via the ß2-AR. Moreover, the long chain Aß1-40, Aβ1–42, and Aβ10–37, yet not the short-chain Aß peptides prevented the clenbuterol induced desensitization of the ß2-AR. In addition, we identified functional autoantibodies in the sera of AD patients, activating the ß2-AR, like the ß2-agAAb found in patients with glaucoma. As autoimmune mechanisms were reportedly involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and Alzheimer’s Disease, we postulate that overstimulation of the ß2-AR pathway can induce an adrenergic overdrive, that may play an important role in the multifactorial interplay of neurodegenerative disorders."

The special sub-models of the introduced family provide unimodal, bimodal, symmetric, and asymmetric density shapes. A special sub-model of the new family, called the new extended heavy-tailed Weibull (NEHTW) distribution, is studied in more detail. The NEHTW parameters have been estimated via eight classical estimation procedures. The performance of these methods have been explored using detailed simulation results which have been ordered, using partial and overall ranks, to determine the best estimation method. Two important risk measures are derived for the NEHTW distribution. To prove the usefulness of the two actuarial measures in financial sciences, a simulation study is conducted. Finally, the flexibility and importance of the NEHTW model are illustrated empirically using two real-life insurance data sets. Based on our study, we observe that the NEHTW distribution may be a good candidate for modeling financial and actuarial sciences data."

The objective in this study was to evaluate the performance of a sprinkler irrigation system with hose and shower, traditionally used in clay tennis court, and propose another low-cost system that is operational and technically feasible, which is the irrigating bar. For each irrigation system, three evaluations were performed. At the beginning of each test, the pressures and flow rates of the emitters were measured, and the water distribution profile method was used to determine the distribution uniformity of the systems. Distribution efficiency was obtained through the Christiansen's (UC), distribution (UD), absolute (UA), statistical (US) and Hart's (UH) uniformity coefficients, HSPA standard efficiency (UHSPA) and, coefficient of variation (CV). Subsequently, the application and irrigation efficiencies were calculated. It was found that the irrigation bar required lower operating pressure, as well as greater stability of pressure and flow in relation to the hose system. Water losses in the hose/shower system (22.0%) were higher than in the irrigation bar (0.6%). Regardless of the evaluated system, UC (68.4% and 86.5%) and UH (66.4% and 87.5%) values were similar and higher than those of the other coefficients (~51.8% and ~81.2%). The collected depths, applied by the hose/shower irrigation system, showed high spatial variability and, consequently, low values of uniformity, being classified as poor or unacceptable. The irrigating bar promoted higher values of uniformity coefficients, being classified as good. Irrigation efficiencies were 53.97 and 85.97% for hose/shower and irrigation bar systems, respectively. The hose/shower system has low performance in the irrigation of clay tennis courts. The irrigation bar system, for providing technical, operational, and economic benefits, and has the potential to be used in the irrigation of clay tennis courts."

Sri Lanka is a lower-middle-income country with a unique public health infrastructure that provides multiple interventions across the lifecycle for anemia prevention, despite which anemia in pregnancy remains a challenge. Studying the factors associated with maternal anemia in this context would provide unique information on challenges and opportunities encountered as low-and-middle-income countries attempt to control anemia by improving health care coverage. All first-trimester pregnant women registered for antenatal care in the Anuradhapura district between July 2019 to September 2019 were invited to participate in the baseline of a cohort study. Interviewer-administered and self-completed questionnaires were used. Anemia was defined using a full blood count. A hierarchical logistic regression model was built to identify factors associated with anemia. Out of 3127 participants, 451 (14.4%) were anemic. According to the regression model (Chi-square = 139.3, p<0.001, n = 2692), the odds of being anemic increased with the Period of gestation (PoG) (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01-1.13). While controlling for PoG, age and parity, history of anemia (OR = 3.22, 95%CI = 2.51-4.13), being underweight (OR = 1.64, 95%CI = 1.24-2.18), having the last pregnancy five or more years back (OR = 1.57,95%CI = 1.15-2.15) and having used intrauterine devices for one year or more (OR = 1.63, 95%CI = 1.16-2.30) increased the odds of anemia. Breast feeding during the last year (OR = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.49-0.90) and having used contraceptive injections for one year or more (OR = 0.61,95%CI = 0.45-0.83) reduced the risk of anemia. Proxy indicators of being in frequent contact with the national family health program have a protective effect over the socioeconomic disparities in preventing early pregnancy anemia. Maintaining the continuum of care through the lifecycle, especially through optimizing pre and inter-pregnancy care provision should be the way forward for anemia control."
https://openalex.org/W4302363708,"Disease detection through gas analysis has long been the topic of many studies because of its potential as a rapid diagnostic technique. In particular, the pathogens that cause urinary tract infection (UTI) have been shown to generate different profiles of volatile organic compounds, thus enabling the discrimination of causative agents using an electronic nose. While past studies have performed data collection on either agar culture or jellified urine culture, this study measures the headspace volume of liquid urine culture samples. Evaporation of the liquid and the presence of background compounds during electronic nose (e-nose) device operation could introduce variability to the collected data. Therefore, a headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for quantitating ethanol in the headspace of the urine samples. By leveraging the new method to characterize the sample stability during e-nose measurement, it was revealed that ethanol concentration dropped more than 15% after only three measurement cycles, which equal 30 minutes for this study. It was further shown that by using only data within the first three cycles, better accuracies for between-day classification were achieved, which was 73.7% and 97.0%, compared to using data from within the first nine cycles, which resulted in 65.0% and 81.1% accuracies. Therefore, the newly developed method provides better quality control for data collection, paving ways for the future establishment of a training data library for UTI."

Demographics, socio-economic characteristics, and other admission- or hospital stay-related information were collected and analyzed to determine factors associated with inappropriateness utilizing multivariate regression models.38.5% (n = 112) of admissions and 9.5% (n = 137) of hospital days were categorized as inappropriate, according to the C-PAEP. Children who were non-Shanghai residents (p < 0.001), admitted through the emergency sector (p = 0.030), and/or received services in a surgical ward (p < 0.001) had a higher risk of being admitted inappropriately. Payment method (p = 0.006), service type (p < 0.001), comorbidity (p = 0.016), length of stay (p = 0.007), and appropriateness of admission (p < 0.001) were found to be associated with prevalence of inappropriate hospital days. Approximately three-fourths of the inappropriate admissions were premature admissions (75.9%, n = 85). The most frequent reasons for inappropriate hospital days were awaiting test results (34.3%, n = 47), awaiting surgery (19.7%, n = 27), awaiting test execution (10.9%, n = 15), and family unprepared for home care (10.9%, n = 15).Although the extent of inappropriate hospital days was moderate compared with that found by previous investigations, the prevalence of inappropriateness of admission was considerable. To enhance the appropriateness of hospital care for children, interventions could be implemented according to the associated factors and identified causes."

This pilot study aimed to report on the changes over time in CMI in patients with stroke who have recently learned to walk with a cane. The assessment started as soon as the participants could walk independently with a quad cane, and was repeated up to six sessions as long as the cane was still used. The dual-tasking paradigm required participants to walk and perform continuous subtractions by 3s. Data were analyzed for 9 participants 33-127 days post-stroke. All 9 participants showed CMI in walking velocity at baseline and 8 of these showed improvement over time (Z = -2.547; p = 0.011). The improvement in CMI was associated with baseline dual-tasking performance (ρ = 0.600; p = 0.044), motor control ability (ρ = -0.695; p = 0.019), walking velocity (ρ = -0.767; p = 0.008), and functional mobility (ρ = 0.817; p = 0.004). All participants showed decrements in both tasks (mutual interference) at baseline, 1 evolved to decrements in walking velocity (cognitive-related motor interference), and 3 finally evolved to decrements in cognitive performance but increments in walking velocity (motor-priority tradeoff). In conclusion, during rehabilitation with cane walking in patients with subacute stroke, the dual-tasking paradigm revealed CMI and its improvements in the majority of participants. Greater improvement in CMI was moderately to strongly associated with worse baseline performance of many variables. The evolution of the CMI pattern over time provides novel information relevant to neurological recovery."
https://openalex.org/W4302763233,"Clinically relevant genetic predictors of radiation response for cervical cancer are understudied due to the morbidity of repeat invasive biopsies required to obtain genetic material. Thus, we aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel noninvasive cervical swab technique to (1) collect tumor DNA with adequate throughput to (2) perform whole-exome sequencing (WES) at serial time points over the course of chemoradiation therapy (CRT).Cervical cancer tumor samples from patients undergoing chemoradiation were collected at baseline, at week 1, week 3, and at the completion of CRT (week 5) using a noninvasive swab-based biopsy technique. Swab samples were analyzed with whole-exome sequencing (WES) with mutation calling using a custom pipeline optimized for shallow whole-exome sequencing with low tumor purity (TP). Tumor mutation changes over the course of treatment were profiled.216 samples were collected and successfully sequenced for 70 patients (94% of total number of tumor samples collected). A total of 33 patients had a complete set of samples at all four time points. The mean mapping rate was 98% for all samples, and the mean target coverage was 180. Estimated TP was greater than 5% for all samples. Overall mutation frequency decreased during CRT but mapping rate and mean target coverage remained at >98% and >180 reads at week 5.This study demonstrates the feasibility and application of a noninvasive swab-based technique for WES analysis which may be applied to investigate dynamic tumor mutational changes during treatment to identify novel genes which confer radiation resistance."
