https://openalex.org/W2147758955,"We mapped a gene predisposing to myocardial infarction to a locus on chromosome 13q12-13. A four-marker single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotype in this locus spanning the gene ALOX5AP encoding 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) is associated with a two times greater risk of myocardial infarction in Iceland. This haplotype also confers almost two times greater risk of stroke. Another ALOX5AP haplotype is associated with myocardial infarction in individuals from the UK. Stimulated neutrophils from individuals with myocardial infarction produce more leukotriene B4, a key product in the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, than do neutrophils from controls, and this difference is largely attributed to cells from males who carry the at-risk haplotype. We conclude that variants of ALOX5AP are involved in the pathogenesis of both myocardial infarction and stroke by increasing leukotriene production and inflammation in the arterial wall."

https://openalex.org/W2169128738,"Ataxia-ocular apraxia 2 (AOA2) was recently identified as a new autosomal recessive ataxia. We have now identified causative mutations in 15 families, which allows us to clinically define this entity by onset between 10 and 22 years, cerebellar atrophy, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, oculomotor apraxia and elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Ten of the fifteen mutations cause premature termination of a large DEAxQ-box helicase, the human ortholog of yeast Sen1p, involved in RNA maturation and termination."

https://openalex.org/W2103045139,"Wnt signaling defines the colonic epithelial progenitor cell phenotype, and mutations in the gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) that activate the Wnt pathway cause the familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP) syndrome and most sporadic colon cancers. The mechanisms that regulate the transition of epithelial precursor cells into their differentiated derivatives are poorly characterized. We report that Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is expressed by mature colonocytes and regulates their differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling restricts the expression of Wnt targets to the base of the colonic crypt in vivo, and transfection of Ihh into colon cancer cells leads to a downregulation of both components of the nuclear TCF4-beta-catenin complex and abrogates endogenous Wnt signaling in vitro. In turn, expression of Ihh is downregulated in polyps of individuals with FAP and expression of doxycycline-inducible dominant negative TCF4 (dnTCF4) restores Ihh expression in APC mutant DLD-1 colon cancer cells. These data identify a new Wnt-Hh axis in colonic epithelial renewal."

https://openalex.org/W2007114975,"Chemical genomics involves generating large collections of small molecules and using them to modulate cellular states. Despite recent progress in the systematic synthesis of structurally diverse compounds, their use in screens of cellular circuitry is still an ad hoc process. Here, we outline a general, efficient approach called gene expression-based high-throughput screening (GE-HTS) in which a gene expression signature is used as a surrogate for cellular states, and we describe its application in a particular setting: the identification of compounds that induce the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. In screening 1,739 compounds, we identified 8 that reliably induced the differentiation signature and, furthermore, yielded functional evidence of bona fide differentiation. The results indicate that GE-HTS may be a powerful, general approach for chemical screening."

https://openalex.org/W2023962715,"Mitogens activate protein translation through phosphorylation of p7S6 kinase (p70(S6K)) and eIF4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). A recent report (Science 294, 1942, 2001) has implicated phospholipase D (PLD) in mTOR signaling. We studied the role of PLD in the phosphorylation of p70(S6K) and 4E-BP1 induced by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) using fibroblasts deficient in PLD activity and also 1-butanol, which inhibits phosphatidic acid production by PLD. The reduction in PLD activity in both situations impaired the effect of LPA on mTOR signaling but did not inhibit the effect of PDGF. PDGF induced marked phosphorylation of Akt (a PI3K target) but this was not affected by PLD deficiency. LPA caused much less phosphorylation of Akt and this was dependent on PLD activity. Toxin B, which inactivates Rho GTPases, markedly impaired PLD1 activation and phosphorylation of Akt, p70(S6K), and 4E-BP1 induced by LPA but had a minimal or no effect on the actions of PDGF. These results support the hypothesis that LPA activates protein translation through the action of PLD1-generated PA on mTOR and the PI3K/Akt pathway whereas PDGF acts through P13K/Akt independent of PLD1."

https://openalex.org/W202993890,"Equine and bovine serum proteins have recently been fractionated by means of a physical method utilizing an electrophoretic adaptation of the principles of the Clusius column (l-4), first described and tested by Kirkwood (5) and Nielsen (6). The method of electrophoresis-convection has now been applied to the fractionation of human γ-globulin. The γ-globulin was prepared by ethanol fractionation (7) from the plasma of individuals hyperimmunized to Hemophilus pertussis organisms. The resulting fractions of γ-globulin have been characterized electrophoretically, and the protective antibody activity and agglutinin titer have been measured."
