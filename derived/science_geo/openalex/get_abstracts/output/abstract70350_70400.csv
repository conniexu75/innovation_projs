https://openalex.org/W2012035446,"A mildly painful electric shock lasting 0.5 second was delivered every 30 seconds to the skin of male rats while they were with a receptive female rat. Sexual behavior occurred, with brief latency, after shocks; thus, successive shocks resulted in a pacing of sexual behavior. This effect is attributed to periodic augmentation of sexual arousal by a periodic, nonspecific arousing stimulus (that is, shock)."

https://openalex.org/W1533366514,"Abstract 3H-Aldosterone-macromolecular complexes were isolated from the nuclear and cytosol fractions of rat kidneys by precipitation with (NH4)2SO4 and by chromatography on Sephadex G-50 and G-75. These complexes were recovered after injection of 3H-aldosterone into adrenalectomized rats and after incubation of labeled steroid with renal nuclear extracts and cytosol fractions in vitro. The nuclear aldosterone binding substances were identified as proteins by the following criteria: (a) chemical analysis of Tris-CaCl2 extracts of purified nuclear fractions; (b) dissociation of the complexes by wide spectrum proteolytic enzymes but not by nucleases; and (c) loss of 3H-aldosterone-binding activity when the complexes were treated with the sulfhydryl reagents, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and 2-(2-aminoethyl)-2-thiopseudourea dihydrochloride. The cytosol aldosterone-binding substances were identified as proteins by the following criteria: (a) dissociation of the complexes by wide spectrum proteolytic enzymes but not by nucleases, lipase, or phospholipase; (b) loss of 3H-aldosterone-binding activity on treatment with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. Estradiol-17β,6α-methylprednisolone, deoxycorticosterone, and 9α-fluorocortisol impaired the formation of the 3H-aldosterone-macromolecular complexes in the nuclear and cytosol fractions in direct proportion to their potencies in the regulation of renal tubular transport of sodium. In the in vitro system, spirolactone inhibited the formation of the 3H-aldosterone complex at concentration ratios that inhibit the action of aldosterone in the rat in vivo. The isomer of aldosterone, 17-isoaldosterone, was not bound to the proteins in nuclear extracts, and at a 10-fold concentration ratio did not inhibit the formation of 3H-aldosterone complexes in nuclear extracts. In addition, 17-isoaldosterone (1.4 x 10-7 m) had no effect on active sodium transport in the isolated toad bladder system and at 1 µg/150 g of body weight had no effect on the urinary Na+:K+ concentration ratios in the adrenalectomized rat. Thus, we have isolated and partially purified renal nuclear proteins which have many of the properties to be expected of the specific mineralocorticoid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1602426108,"Abstract Previous studies with propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase and with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase using 18O-labeled bicarbonate have indicated that bicarbonate is the reactive species in these fixations of CO2. We have investigated the species of CO2 in reactions catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase, P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase, and P-enolpyruvate carboxytransphosphorylase. Since propionyl-CoA carboxylase and pyruvate carboxylase are biotin enzymes, they would be expected to have similar mechanisms. Likewise, the reactions catalyzed by P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase and carboxy transphosphorylase are, in some respects, similar to that of P-enolpyruvate carboxylase, and it has been suggested that bicarbonate might be the reactant in each case. By means of radiochemical and spectrophotometric techniques, we have obtained evidence that the active species in the carboxykinase and carboxytransphosphorylase reactions is CO2 and not bicarbonate. Bicarbonate appears to be the active species in the pyruvate carboxylase reaction, in conformity with the results obtained with propionyl-CoA carboxylase."

https://openalex.org/W1598739109,"Abstract The metabolism of testosterone to 6β-, 7α-, and 16α-hydroxytestosterone by rat liver microsomes is inhibited by carbon monoxide. The degree of inhibition of the three hydroxylation reactions differs. The ratios of CO to O2 needed for 50% inhibition of the 16α-, 6β-, and 7α-hydroxylation of testosterone are 0.93, 1.54, and 2.36, respectively. Studies on the light reversibility of the CO inhibition revealed that light at 450 mµ decreases the inhibitory effect of CO on the 6β-, 7α-, and 16α-hydroxylation reactions to a greater extent than light at other wave lengths. The results obtained suggest that one or more CO-binding cytochromes function in the hydroxylation of testosterone by rat liver microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1527292086,"Abstract Surface potentials, ψg, of mixtures of synthetic phosphatides dispersed in uni-univalent electrolyte have been calculated from the limiting molecular areas through use of the Gouy equation. Electrophoretic mobilities of the dispersed particles were measured and used to calculate ζ potentials from the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski equation. In analogy with several structurally related systems, the ratio ζ/ψg was found to be unity at low surface charge density (σ l 20,000 e.s.u. cm-2), decreasing progressively at higher surface charge density to a minimum of 0.58. The ζ potential at low surface charge density is appreciably affected by the composition of the fatty acyl substituents to the extent that this determines the cross-sectional area per net negative charge in the bilayer. Charge reversal concentrations have been measured for various metal ions on several phosphatide surfaces differing in charge density. Inserting the conditions for charge reversal into the Stern equation, the standard free energy of adsorption for each cation was calculated and used to obtain a value for the logarithm of the apparent association constant, K'. At an initial surface charge density below 20,000 e.s.u. cm-2, the sequence of values of log K' was Ag l Ba l Sr l Ni l Mg l Ca l Co l Zn l Cu l Mn l Pb l Cd l La l Ce l Th l UO2. Comparison of log K' for magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium as a function of surface charge density suggests that the larger cations are able to form ion triplets at high surface charge density while the smaller cations are unable to do so. The high affinity of UO22+ for phosphatide surfaces is also considered. The results obtained are discussed in terms of their potential applicability to several problems of current biochemical interest."
https://openalex.org/W1515500403,"Abstract Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase has been purified approximately 600-fold from cow brain. The purified enzyme catalyzes the irreversible decarboxylation of orotidine 5'-phosphate to form uridine 5'-phosphate and is inhibited by cytidine monophosphate g uridine monophosphate g cytidine diphosphate g uridine diphosphate g cytidine triphosphate. From kinetic data the inhibition appears to represent a simple competitive interaction at the catalytic site. Those compounds which act as competitive inhibitors were also found to stabilize the enzyme under conditions of heat denaturation. It appears unlikely that the observed inhibition serves a role in regulating pyrimidine levels. During purification and heat denaturation experiments, activity of orotidine 5'-phosphate pyrophosphorylase appears to parallel orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1523546848,"Abstract Preparations from the brain of young rats contain enzymes that catalyze the transfer of sulfate-35S from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate-35S to galactose-containing glycosphingolipids and to galactose and water-soluble galactosides. These enzymes were found in all of the subcellular particles and in the high speed supernatant (cytosol). Kinetic experiments, quantitative differences in subcellular distribution, and fractionation with ammonium sulfate of solubilized microsomes showed that one enzyme catalyzes the transfer to glycosphingolipids and a different one to the water-soluble compounds. The relative affinity of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate for the glycosphingolipid sulfotransferase was 4 times higher than the affinity of the same substrate for the sulfotransferase for the water-soluble galactosides. The apparent Km for galactosylceramide was found to be between 3.3 and 8.5 x 10-5 m; for lactosylceramide it was 5.58 x 10-5 m; for galactosylsphingosine it was 4.55 x 10-5 m. Under the same conditions as tested for the sphingolipids the apparent Km for lactose was 1.2 x 10-2 m, and for galactose was 1.12 x 10-1 m. The fastest rates of sulfation for the lipids were with lactosylceramide and galactosylsphingosine; for the water-soluble acceptors the maximal velocity was with p-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside. A pH optimum of 6.8 to 7.0 was found for both enzymes. The rate of release of sulfate under acid conditions and the chromatographic behavior of enzymatically synthesized galactosylceramide and lactosylceramide were compared with those of the natural sulfatides; the results showed that the sulfate attached enzymatically was in position C3 of the galactose moiety. The position of attachment of sulfate to the water-soluble acceptors was not identified. Methods for the determination of the enzymes and for preparations of various glycosphingolipids are given."

https://openalex.org/W1607793080,"Abstract A purified bovine liver protein, which was recently shown to be rapidly phosphorylated on incubation with AT32P, has been identified as a nucleoside diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6). Human erythrocytic nucleoside diphosphate kinase was therefore incubated with AT32P and degraded by alkaline hydrolysis, in order to compare the phosphorylated degradation products with those from liver nucleoside diphosphate kinase incubated with AT32P. In accordance with previous results with the liver enzyme, 1-32P-phosphohistidine, 3-32P-phosphohistidine, and N-e-32P-phospholysine could all be isolated from AT32P-incubated erythrocytic nucleoside diphosphate kinase. The additional radioactive products obtained from the two 32P-labeled nucleoside diphosphate kinases were found to be identical, as judged by paper electrophoresis, indicating active sites of the same or similar structure."
https://openalex.org/W1983154569,Simultaneous recording of behavioral responses and action potentials from single chemoreceptors in the proboscis of intact blowflies revealed that acceptance of a solution can be mediated either by input from one water receptor or from one salt receptor. Rejection of higher concentrations of salt is mediated by the same salt receptor. A difference of three impulses in the first 100 milliseconds of activity can determine whether the fly accepts or rejects the solution.

Soluble aniline-carbohydrate complexes account for only a small fraction of the hydrolyzed 3',4'-dichloropropionanilide. The major portion of the 3,4-dichloroaniline moiety is found complexed with polymeric cell constituents, mainly lignin. The aniline is lignin-bound as 3,4-dichloroaniline and not as 3',4'-dichloropropionanilide."

https://openalex.org/W12692275,"Abstract When rat liver mitochondria suspended in salt-free 0.25 m sucrose solution are mixed with weakly buffered solutions of NaCl, the suspending medium undergoes very rapid acidification. This reaction was found to proceed in the absence of electron transport. The amount of acid produced increased with increasing NaCl concentration, with increasing initial pH, and with increasing concentration of mitochondria. The H+ released exceeded 35 nmoles per mg of protein. Similar effects were given when NaCl was replaced by chlorides of other univalent cations; the relative activities were Li+ g NH4+ g choline+ g Na+ g K+ g Rb+ g Tris+. The acidification requires the presence of a salt; as little as 2.5 mm NaCl produced measurable H+ release. Acid-base titration curves of intact rat liver mitochondria were increasingly displaced to the acid side by increasing NaCl concentration. Flame photometry of mitochondria isolated after mixing with NaCl (or LiCl) solutions showed that Na+ (or Li+) was bound to the mitochondria in an amount that was equimolar to H+ released. This interaction was not intrinsically affected by 2,4-dinitrophenol, gramicidin, or valinomycin. During binding of Na+ and equimolar release of H+, endogenous K+ and Mg++ were lost from the mitochondria to the medium in the absence of valinomycin or other permeability-inducing agents. These observations on binding of alkali metal cations appear to provide a possible basis for their action in increasing the Ca++:O accumulation ratio during energy-linked Ca++ uptake to superstoichiometric levels."

https://openalex.org/W1493182362,"Abstract Studies of equilibrium exchange rates showed that the ATP-AMP phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.4.3), yeast adenylate kinase, reaction was of a random order. The rates of exchange of AMP and ATP with ADP under similar conditions were very nearly equal. A double reciprocal plot of the exchange rate against the ATP concentration yielded a minimum dissociation constant of the same order as the Km value for ATP. These data served as indications of a random mechanism. An experiment with the use of 14C- and 32P-labeled nucleotides in equilibrium exchange studies revealed that the rate-limiting step of the reaction was the interconversion of the ternary complex and not the binding of substrates or the dissociation of products. The equilibrium concentrations of the adenosine and deoxyadenosine 5'-phosphates were also determined at various pH values, magnesium ion concentrations, and temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W1487267933,"Abstract The optical assay for enol oxalacetate is a convenient method for studying the kinetics of reactions in which oxalacetate is formed or used. Difficulties with the technique arise because the spontaneous keto-enol tautomerism of oxalacetate is a slow reaction in the absence of certain transition metal ions. If valid assays are to be obtained, it is necessary to know how the tautomerism affects the kinetics of oxalacetate formation and disappearance. Under the experimental conditions used for assay of maliclactic transhydrogenase, the tautomerism of oxalacetate is catalyzed by the basic form of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris base). Even in the presence of Tris buffer, however, the rate constants for tautomerism are small. In 0.10 m Tris buffer, at 24°, over the pH range 6.79 to 9.02, the following equation describes the relation between the first order constant for tautomerism (k1 + k2, the sum of the forward and reverse rate constants for tautomerism) and the Tris base concentration (T), expressed as moles per liter: k1 + k2 = T (1.22 x 102m-1 min-1) + 0.5 min-1 Hydroxyl ion is approximately 30 times as active a catalyst as Tris base. The effect of the keto-enol tautomerism of oxalacetate on the kinetics of oxalacetate formation and utilization can be accounted for by the rate equations presented in this paper. In conjunction with the data on the spontaneous keto-enol tautomerism, the equations make it possible to predict the conditions under which valid kinetic data can be obtained. Agreement between the theoretical models and the experimental data has shown, in addition, that the keto tautomer is the enzymically active form of oxalacetate for both the forward and reverse directions of the reversible reaction catalyzed by malic-lactic transhydrogenase."

https://openalex.org/W1496192020,"Abstract Soluble hexokinase from frog skeletal muscle has been purified 180-fold. Interconvertible molecular forms of hexokinase were found in the 105,000 x g supernatant. They may be separated by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration into a heavier molecule, hexokinase-H, and a lighter molecule, hexokinase-L (apparent mol wt, 100,000). On sucrose gradient, hexokinase-H may be separated into polyaggregates of hexokinase-L with apparent molecular weights ranging from 300,000 to 3 million. The molecular species are interconvertible with changes in ionic strength and appear to be in equilibrium with each other. Hexokinase-H is activated by orthophosphate, particularly at high ATP concentration, whereas hexokinase-L is not. Thus 8 mm orthophosphate raised the Vmax 2-fold for hexokinase-H. 1,5-Anhydroglucitol-6-P (analogue of glucose-6-P) served as an inhibitor competitive with respect to ATP and noncompetitive with respect to glucose. Hexokinase-H was more resistant to the noncompetitive inhibition of glucose. The Ki values for noncompetitive inhibition of glucose by 1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-P for hexokinase-H and hexokinase-L were 0.62 and 0.32 mm, respectively. Similar kinetic constants for both the purified hexokinase-H and hexokinase-L were: Km for ATP, 1.48 mm; Ki of 1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-P for ATP, 0.058 mm; Km for glucose, 0.100 mm. Varying the ATP concentration had no effect on the Km for glucose. Physiological concentrations of orthophosphate could overcome the competitive or noncompetitive inhibition of both hexokinase-H and hexokinase-L by 1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-P."
